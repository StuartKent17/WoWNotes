<br />
What Is Blizzard SMS Protect?<br />
Blizzard SMS Protect lets you perform certain account actions from your mobile phone (such as removing your Authenticator), and can be set up to provide you with account activity notifications. All you need is a supported text-enabled cell phone to get started.<br />
<br />
What can SMS Protect do for you?<br />
<br />
<br />
Unlock your Blizzard account<br />
Remove a damaged or lost Blizzard Authenticator<br />
Recover your account name<br />
Reset your password<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition, you can turn on alerts to have text messages sent directly to your phone notifying you of certain kinds of account activity, like password changes and security feature additions or removals.<br />
<br />
These text messages are an easy way to help protect your account from unauthorized access and changes.<br />
<br />
Remember, you can further safeguard your account by never sharing your password, using unique passwords on each site you visit, and staying aware of potential email and phishing scams.<br />
<br />

<br />
Where Can I Get the Blizzard Authenticator?<br />

Give a good argument, beyond &quot;muh prestige&quot;. why?<br />
<br />
And while you're at it, also give a good explanation for why WoTLK Scarab Lords are ok, and not a total destruction of Scarab Lord prestige.<br />
<br />
And after that, why the Ultramarine Qiraji Battle Tank is ok.<br />

<br />
No, exclusivity and the idea that making things 'difficult' (see: requires X amount of people or grinding, rarely ever strategy) to get is rewarding is exactly what made this game the shitshow it is.<br />
<br />
People like you just can't seem to separate that from the dopamine releases in their brains. I swear dopamine addicts are going to ruin gaming.</div></div><hr />

This.<br />
<br />
And that aside, a vast majority of current Scarab Lords (in all likelihood and probability) are WoTLK ones. I'd like Zeta333 to explain how it's okay that not only do they get to cheese something that he considers prestigious long after it's relevant, but they also get a second exclusive mount for it.<br />

To be frank, I don't even want the Black Qiraji Battle Tank and the Scarab Lord title. I made my peace with the fact that I missed out on it, plain and simple, and respect that.<br />
<br />
But when they put current development time into a new model, with new textures and even a new design, I'm miffed when it's given to people who did a thing a decade ago, years before an updated model was even conceived by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

He can't, because like every other prestige lord or exclusive dirt bag they can't give any reason why their designs are good other than it feels good to them: IE slaves to dopamine releases.</div></div><hr />

Such a great use of dev time like these ridiculous 3 days a year mounts that will prolly disappear when its over and you need to get them again next year just for 3 days!</div></div><hr />

Well, that is one argument to make. If he thinks prestige is good, that can be a valid argument.<br />
<br />
But in this case, he'd have to descend into some heavy cognitiv dissonance to explain why the aforementioned things are ok.<br />
<br />
1. Scarab Lords in WoTLK that cheesed it then and there when the content was 10 times easier.<br />
2. The people owning the Cataclysm-introduced Ultramarine Qiraji Battle Tank.<br />
<br />
Mind you, the first group owns the direct mount and title that is supposed to be prestigious, and the second group owns the same model in a different coloration.<br />
<br />
This one is an entirely new model with new textures. That's like introducing new Nether Drake models and giving them only to old TBC Gladiators.</div></div><hr />

The problem with it feeling good is that it's just objectively not. You said it yourself, it was cheesed it WotLK and it actually isn't all that difficult to do, more than anything required timing.<br />
<br />
It's this kind of exclusive mundane shit that people like him exalt to the mountains when it fundamentally means nothing other than the dopamine release in their brains. It's pathetic and designing the game around it shows Blizzard cares more about their whales than their consumers.</div></div><hr />

Myeah, I don't know. I'm not ready to debate the merits of prestige in games, and I definitely don't mind the existence of the original Black Qiraji Battle Tank mount and Scarab Lord title.<br />
<br />
It's just that if you want to make the case that the new Black Qiraji War Tank being obtainable by players currently stomps on the prestige of original Scarab Lords, then you'll have to deliberately ignore the far more egregious cases of &quot;prestige-stomping&quot; that are the WoTLK Scarab Lords and Ultramarine Qiraji Battle Tank.</div></div><hr />

People who don't have Scarab Lord (or some of the other unobtainable titles like Immortal, Obsidian Slayer, etc.) have long since accepted that they missed that boat, and it's fine, because they still got things that others could not later obtain like say the Vampiric Batling/Onyxian Whelpling pets.<br />
<br />
What rubs me the wrong way about this particular situation is the fact that they actively spent art/development/design time to add a new unique mount model to the game that's only obtainable by people that hit a gong 12 years ago. That feels like it's developers deliberately rubbing the faces of those that started playing after Vanilla in it. Why does that even make sense to do? Those people were already rewarded in the first place.</div></div><hr />

No one is touching the old mount or title. It's still around and still unobtainable.<br />
<br />
This is a new model, with a new design (the old one had no beak and bony protrusions and spikes), with new textures, with current development time put into it.<br />

Yes. I was assuming that the Qiraji mounts they added in 7.3.5 wouldn't just be thrown to Scarab Lords especially because they were a new thing. I've never complained about the original Black Qiraji Battle Tank, but the fact that they made these new ones for no reason, just to gift it to a group of people that already got one unique mount and title more than 10 years down the line rubs me wrong.</div></div><hr />

cus blizzard was to fucking lazy to remove the wrath scarab lords isnt my issue. But it also doesnt mean every window licker in wow should get one. Was a bug in the new servers that they didnt see untill it was to late and didnt address it either. Which i think they should of. Everyone else got thier archeology battle tank, so why do you think you should demand the black one? So what if a modeler and artist spent a day updating a super ultra rare mount? Fuck its the same argument i heard from casuals over mimihead or invincible. People need to accept there are some exclusive things that were given out in the past that they will not be able to get no matter how much they cry unfair on the forums.<br />

Your argument sucks and is invalid is what I'm reading.<br />
<br />
Different mount, so expecting different rules is logical. No one is touching the old one, and no Scarab Lord asked for an updated one.<br />
<br />
And no, you can't just sidestep the fact that the Scarab Lord mount's prestige was already ruined before, way harder.<br />
<br />
In comparison, letting current players earn this new model does nothing to diminish the prestige, because people can tell from a huge distance which the original is.</div></div><hr />

Oh, you mean the Grinning Reaver? Well, it was built on the Silithid skeleton as a base and has the same basic design ideas. I guess it has to be removed because it tramples on Scarab Lords!</div></div><hr />

This could've been current content. Rare or easy, this could have been a cool new mount (along with the other colorations) for people to farm. But that would be so horrible, apparently.<br />
<br />
And there are a few original ones left, but by far most of them still playing are ones that cheesed it during WoTLK. (talk about stomping on prestige!)<br />
<br />
Also, they are very appreciative. You should've seen the comment section of the Reddit thread when they thought the new mount would replace the old one (not just be an extra). 90% of the posters were calling it ugly.</div></div><hr />

It's curious that Ion Hazzikostas just so happens to be a Scarab Lord! <br />

(though I wonder original, or WoTLK cheeser)<br />
<br />
But yeah, I maintain that a new model should be available from current efforts. I don't care if the new one becomes the rarest thing ever again, or easy as sin, it should be obtainable from current content, not &quot;you had to have done a thing more than a decade ago to get a mount and title and then you get a bonus title now and if you don't like it build a time machine lol!!&quot;<br />
<br />
And the new mount still is nothing like the old one, so no, it does not trample on Scarab Lord achievements at all.<br />
<br />
Or do you want all the non-gladiator Netherdrakes removed from the game, too? By grinding rep, you can literally get the same mount model that gladiators got, only without armor.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, this new Black Qiraji not only has no armor, but it has a whole new model and textureset, as well as a different design. That's leaps and bounds more different from the original Black Qiraji than any gladiator mount is different from a regularly obtainable mount.<br />

No, exclusivity and the idea that making things 'difficult' (see: requires X amount of people or grinding, rarely ever strategy) to get is rewarding is exactly what made this game the shitshow it is.<br />

People like you just can't seem to separate that from the dopamine releases in their brains. I swear dopamine addicts are going to ruin gaming.<br />

No, they made the red and blue mounts for that micro holiday, and then spent about five minutes recoloring it black, since they were already there.

Yeah I also have the store one (bought it for charity but never actually used it much). I still don't get why they didn't make it a flying mount tho, being the very low number of Scarab Lords it wouldn't have made any difference, I think. But whatever, we got it for free anyway :D</div></div><hr />

Do you know what happened when the Zandalari Tiger and Raptor were removed? They added new ones that anyone could get them.<br />
Do you know what happened when the ZG bear was removed? They added a new one anyone could get it.<br />
Do you know what happened with the naxxramas proto drakes when they were removed? They added them back to the BMA so anyone could get it.<br />
<br />
So explain why the BRAND NEW black mount should remain exclusive when HISTORY has shown that Blizzard has added very similar but different mounts back into game so anyone can get them (with different kinds of effort). I agree that the old mount should never be added back to WoW and should remain exclusive, however why can't people get the new ones? I would ask you to explain it but the fact is that there is no proper explanation for it.<br />

Aw well, I will likely see this mount running around once every month or so.<br />

Where were you when they added other mount variations into the game? Did you also cry because they added a ZG panther/new raptor? Did you also complain that they added the proto drakes back into the game? Get the hell off your high horse, if you did it back in the day you have a TITLE and a MOUNT to show it off. Even if 99% of WoW had the new black one YOU WOULD STILL HAVE THE ORIGINAL ONE THAT STANDS OUT.

<br />
Yeah. Can't wait until TBC Gladiators get a free mount.<br />
<br />
*before i say anything, ill say that im not for the updated model change at all, quite against it. And that I started played in early BC, my server was a new one so the guy who got it on my server did it during the early days of TBC, so its not like I had much of a shot at it or anything (i was 57 i think at the time, travel form ran all the way to silithus to see the event).<br />
<br />
I disagree with giving it to everyone because as you said there is already the ultramarine battletank. Yes its a pain in the ass (still working on it, its been years, in those years, have had ravenlord drop for me 4 times, deathchargers reins twice, alar, invincible and numerous others), but thats how this was too. It was not just a guild effort but a server wide effort. I remember the horde guild who was working on it, getting alliance guilds to do their part (it was dead alliance side on that server). <br />
<br />
This was while they outgeared and outleveled content so I can only imagine the people who did it in vanilla with much less in the way of quality of life as compared to TBC players. <br />
<br />
The WOTLK ones are to me in the same boat as the dude on my old server. What can you do, perhaps blizz should release new servers with the doors to ahn'qiraj already open. I dont know if they changed that or not but i think i remember something about it cuz people used to realm hop to get it (dont even know how cuz it required a ton of city wide mat turn ins and stuff).<br />
<br />
I am assuming they updated the model not as a priority but because given the new expac story line stuff is happening in silithus that is changing these things, and due to that being updated the model got updated (the new quests talk about how they are adapting and evolving due to sargeras blade/strike).</div></div><hr />

Honestly, everything is better in my opinion than randomly giving it to a group of people where the majority of those still playing cheesed it in WoTLK, or alternatively, haven't really done much in terms of intensive play since maybe Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
I don't mind if it's easy, hard, almost impossible to get, but a model developed this year should be available from current gameplay, even if it'll be extremely limited like &quot;the original.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Just gonna grab a little snippet of your post if you don't mind.<br />
<br />
I'm honestly not suggesting the new mount should be given out with a box of cereal (although I don't care how easy or hard it is in the long run). Blizzard has many ways of distributing a mount like this in a prestigious manner without having to award it to original Scarab Lords. I honestly don't mind which that is, if it's piss-easy or so hard that you'll be wiping on several mythic bosses for hours. I just think current players should be capable of obtaining it if they want to put their mind to it, without having to buy a time machine.<br />
<br />
And if we really wanna talk about original Scarab Lord prestige, I think that any of those that got it after Classic/the original opening, should have had it removed.</div></div><hr />

And i dont support them being added. If you were not there for the content to get them they should be locked out for those that did. It encourages people to complete current content and gives extra incentive to complete when its current. to many people wait untill the next tier is out and blitz the old one. I dont think that should reward anything but old loot and chevos. Just cus you pay for the game doesnt entitle you to everything in the game files.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. And just because you're a Scarab Lord doesn't entitle you to getting a new model.<br />
<br />
It's a pure fact that the new mount is only similar in basic structure and color. On all other fronts, it's different. Let's count, shall we?<br />
<br />
1. It has no armor. The original does.<br />
2. It is a new mesh, developed in 2017, not in classic.<br />
3. It has new textures. Once again, developed in 2017, with sub money from people playing currently<br />
4. It has fairly major design differences, like the mandible shape, the spikes and the beak that the old one didn't have.<br />
5. The spell ID is different and not shared with the old one.<br />
6. The mount description is different and not shared with the old one.</div></div><hr />

No, they made the red and blue mounts for that micro holiday, and then spent about five minutes recoloring it black, since they were already there. Some of you crybabies need to seriously check out the holidays and what's coming up before getting all ass blasted about not getting something you don't deserve.<br />
<br />
(if anything it's a subtle hint about the next expansion's &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;totally out of nowhere&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; Old God plot twist that the Silithid, their most prominent minions, are getting HD upgrades. Kind of like how EVERY demon in the game got a rework in the Hellfire Citadel patch, even ones that weren't even in that raid, and then Legion happened.)<br />
<br />
You know, it's sad, that even after this excellent, rational and well thought out explanation, the same people are still whining about how stupid it was that Blizzard spent resources on this.<br />
<br />
I guess some people just want to whine for the sake of whining, and will not be deterred by reason or logic.</div></div><hr />

If you were not there for the content to get them they should be locked out for those that did. It encourages people to complete current content and gives extra incentive to complete when its current. to many people wait untill the next tier is out and blitz the old one. I dont think that should reward anything but old loot and chevos. Just cus you pay for the game doesnt entitle you to everything in the game files.<br />
<br />
But the question becomes where do you draw the line and WHY? If they didn't do it for those mounts why do it for a new model mount? They completely readded an old mount (proto drakes) without making them newer models, they just added it for anyone who has gold to get.<br />
<br />
My main issue is the inconsistency, and at this point why try to change anything? Just keep the old mount exclusive, allow the new mount to be obtained. If you have ever seen a mount train in Dalararn you can see exclusive mounts. The only thing I dislike is the inconsistency.</div></div><hr />

Too bad. Only the red one is tameable because aside from giving Ion a new mount, they couldn't be bothered to actually give enough of a crap to deal with the wild versions and flag them tameable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm honestly not suggesting the new mount should be given out with a box of cereal (although I don't care how easy or hard it is in the long run). Blizzard has many ways of distributing a mount like this in a prestigious manner without having to award it to original Scarab Lords. I honestly don't mind which that is, if it's piss-easy or so hard that you'll be wiping on several mythic bosses for hours. I just think current players should be capable of obtaining it if they want to put their mind to it, without having to buy a time machine.<br />
<br />
And if we really wanna talk about original Scarab Lord prestige, I think that any of those that got it after Classic/the original opening, should have had it removed.<br />
<br />
i can totally agree with that, im just saying there might be another avenue to the model change. iam assuming (possibly wrong here) that they updated general silithid models in the area due to the changes, and this mount having same/similar model ended up effected. Mind you the key to this being proven/disproven would be if the other ones, the ultramarine or the colored ones usable in the instances also have changed models. If yes then its just a simple model change affecting the entire item, if not then they really screwed the pooch.<br />
<br />
if not outright removal of those that got it after TBC launch, at least they introduce new servers with the gates already open. the only benefit of doubt i can provide in this is that if someone joins the game and wants to experience the whole story then they are kinda flubbed out of it cuz the server is started at a point when the event has already occured. Perhaps if they leave the doors closed but instead of a mount and title you get something like a toy, like the inflatable thunderfury.</div></div><hr />

Oh, that? No, the new Black Qiraji mount is a different spell altogether.<br />
<br />
And I doubt they made the NPC version first and that they just happened to recolor it for this mount, for one simple reason:<br />
<br />
None of the other silithids are updated. The wasps, ants and other silithid types still use 10+ years old models, and I doubt they updated one model just to put it in a hive with otherwise old, outdated models.<br />
<br />
The logical conclusion is that the mount was conceived first, and since they made the model, they just put it in Silithus as well.<br />

Uh, no. The new mount is a new spell. It doesn't replace the old Black Qiraji Battle Tank. Hell, it's even called Black Qiraji War Tank instead of Battle Tank.<br />

The old AQ ones and Ultramarine one aren't updated either. It wasn't an across-the-board update. They very specifically went out of their way to give Scarab Lords a new extra mount for something they did over a decade ago.</div></div><hr />

I'd be okay with that. I still honestly think it's weird to give a new model to Scarab Lords, but if players playing now can do something to work towards it in the near future, that would be fine.</div></div><hr />

They can make it as hard as they need to, even.<br />

Whether it becomes a new Core Hound (from doing a possible pre-BfA launch event Timewalking) and easy, or whether it becomes as hard/harder to get than the original. So long as people can work towards it that play currently without having to buy a time machine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We know from datamining that they have updated at least three mounts (and there is nothing saying they didn't do all of them). A bit of logical conjecture based on this plus other info we have about how Silithus is being worked on for current content, would lead to the reasonable assumption that they have made new models and decided to apply these models to aging content including mounts. Why? Because having done the work, it makes sense to get more mileage out of it to improve the game experience.<br />
<br />
They didn't go out of their way to make a special mount just for Scarab Lords. The Scarab Lord mount simply falls under the umbrella of the work that was done.<br />
<br />
As to why it's a new spell, the reason is pretty obvious as well. Some people will complain if they want to be able to see the old model still. Because some people are like that. It's also possible that in the future we won't be able to get the old models for the red, blue, green and yellow ones</div></div><hr />

No, his main point was to provide a rational explanation for the new mount where, for the 3 previous pages, people have been making irrational, whiny arguments. And yes, he called you crybabies because, no offense, that's how you come across. <br />

You are, of course, correct in that his calling other people crybabies is ironic. But as I keep saying, the fact that he chose to call you crybabies does not have any bearing on the merits of his argument regarding the rationale behind the new model. Your choice to ignore his actual argument because he happened to call you a crybaby simply proves his assertion on the latter.<br />

No, he pretty much came in, gave his explanation (which wasn't correct, by the by) and said anyone who still in any way opposed this decision by Blizzard was a crybaby. You can try to gloss over it all you want, but his post is shallow. You just happened to like it a lot! Which is okay.

The original is called the Black Qiraji Battle Tank. This one is called the Black Qiraji War Tank. It's an extra mount, not a replacement.</div></div><hr />

I like the fact that he recognised the reason for the mount. If it makes you feel better I would agree that it would have been better had he avoided the &quot;crybaby&quot; comment. Not only because it was actually asinine, but also, as has been evident by your responses, because it gives his opponents an opportunity to deflect from the actual point.<br />

SMS is so easily spoofed and its so darn easy get access to someones phone number through social engineering so there is no added security by having both, you actually reduce the security compared to only having the authenticator..<br />
<br />
Unless they move to a three-factor authentication (which would be overkill for something like this) where one would need the password, authenticator and SMS-token it would make sense. But enforcing you to have the authenticator + SMS Protect doesn't make much sense from a security standpoint.</div></div><hr />

Why? Well SMS based 2FA isn't exactly secure or good practice: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/12/06/2fa_missed_warning/<br />
<br />
Sure someone would have to jump through some significant hoops to spoof the phone and get access to an account, it's most likely not going to happen for a game, but that's not really a good reason to entice people to enabling it. This is purely to reduce customer support requests by shunting some of the common authenticator based ones over to self service.</div></div><hr />

People are joking about &quot;where's my updated Zulian Tiger mount&quot;, but they have a point. There's no precedent for this, in fact the opposite, with older rare mounts getting newer reskins or releases. <br />
<br />
WHY give a brand new HD mount to people for a 10 year old achievement? They already have a cool looking mount from the reward they did, which is suitably different (and in my opinion still superior style wise). Why spend dev time to give a brand new ADDITIONAL mount to so few players that didn't even ask for it or need it. <br />
<br />
Blizzard also MUST know that 90%+ of the players that actually have it these days did so from exploits or realm swapping, so why reward that? Arguably, people with the Qiraji battle tank went through a MUCH bigger ordeal to get it than most of those with the black one now. <br />
<br />
It's just an incredibly bizzarre thing to do. Literally the ONLY POSSIBLE explanation I can come up with for why Blizzard thought this would be a good idea is that there is someone/some people on the Blizzard team with the old mount that wanted to GIVE THEMSELVES a new HD mount but didn't want anybody else to have it.</div></div><hr />

Because they have reworked the silithid models for the new content in Silithus and it made sense to them to apply those model updates to all the existing models, which includes mounts, not just the black one, but the red and blue as well confirmed and (IMO) probably also the green and yellow.

<br />
Fourth: even if NOT. A reskin of a mount really doesn't take a lot of work. The HD-Upgrade of the mount itself is available to everyone, having put on a new color of skins is more a manner of minutes than a matter of hours; that's not really much of work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But they've NEVER done this before, EVER. What other mounts have they given new HD versions away from free because the models changed in game? Even for pets, they rarely change the models of old pets and just make new ones with the new models to catch instead. If anything the exact opposite has happened - Like when loads of new HD dinosaur models were added in game, so they made the old Bone white raptor mount available in game.<br />
<br />
These old mounts are there for prestige and people use them for prestige both despite and because of the fact they're older with older models. That's the trade-off. Mounts like this and Plagued drake might look a little dated compared to other stuff around at the moment.. but it's the achievement and prestige behind them that counts. They don't need newer HD updates. <br />
<br />
<br />
Why look for a sinister motive when a more benign one will suffice?<br />
Because I genuinely don't see any other serious motive behind this. It's bizarre and different from every precedent they've set before. Even if they were worried that the new one would take away from the uniqueness of the old mount... WHY EVEN ADD the new one then? Or why not just make the new one holiday specific like all of the other new mounts?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coconut</div><div class="date">2018-01-17, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a long time mount collector, this fascination developers have to pander to the &quot;elite&quot; truly disgusts me.<br />
<br />
They should use these new models to reward active players for engaging in fun, fresh content, not keep pandering to the few people who succeeded getting something from shit gameplay or borderline cheating in the past. How about making a new event in Silithus if you want to honor the memory of the Gates of AQ? You know, since WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING THERE THIS PATCH?<br />
<br />
Sometimes I feel developers treat their player base as an ant farm or a Sims City. They want a few people to have unique things because it looks cool from the outside, but they fail to understand how this impacts the players' experience on the inside. Really, this mentality applies to world boss mounts and rare spawns as well, among other things, all of which seem to build a richer world in theory, but provide some awful experiences if you actively engage in getting them as a player.<br />
<br />
It's even more of a slap in the face that the other colors are temporary, while this seems to be a permanent mount that doesn't even require doing a nostalgic turn in quest. Really, really disgusted. /Spit on the devs who thought this up and approved it. I feel pushed away from the game because of their mentality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right. Their approach until now has been to make new ingame mounts. That doesn't mean that they can't, or shouldn't, update other mount models in the future. <br />
<br />
Maybe this one is an exception because the red/blue/yellow/green ones (and maybe some new colours too) will drop in patch in the future, but they have no plans to have a new black one drop anywhere and want to keep it unique.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, if they're going to the effort of making new silithid models for the new content, then it makes sense to apply those models to things like mounts. And yeah, sure, it might be a bit unusual for them to give a new mount model to an old, exclusive mount, but there still is a world of difference between committing the time and effort to making new models because you want to give a cool upgrade to Scarab Lords and giving a cool upgrade to Scarab Lords because you have the new models.<br />
<br />
The former is an indulgent waste of resources which most players would be justified in getting upset about (because those resources could be better spent elsewhere). The latter makes little difference to any of us and the only reason to get upset is essentially sour grapes. I guess if it turns out that in the end no one else gets any of the new models (eg for the blue, red, green and yellow mounts) then we'd have a more legitimate reason to feel cheated, but then again we have no reason to suspect that this won't happen.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zeta333</div><div class="date">2018-01-17, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed. And just because you're a Scarab Lord doesn't entitle you to getting a new model.<br />
<br />
It's a pure fact that the new mount is only similar in basic structure and color. On all other fronts, it's different. Let's count, shall we?<br />
<br />
1. It has no armor. The original does.<br />
2. It is a new mesh, developed in 2017, not in classic.<br />
3. It has new textures. Once again, developed in 2017, with sub money from people playing currently<br />
4. It has fairly major design differences, like the mandible shape, the spikes and the beak that the old one didn't have.<br />
5. The spell ID is different and not shared with the old one.<br />
6. The mount description is different and not shared with the old one.<br />
<br />
Says who being a scarab lord doesnt entitle you to a new model. Blizzard wanted to update the model they did. Now you kids are butthurt beyond compare that you cant have it. Your not entitled to earn it just cus blizzard rebuilt a old mount in new graphics for the few that are still playing with it. Get the fuck over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My main issue is the inconsistency, and at this point why try to change anything? Just keep the old mount exclusive, allow the new mount to be obtained. If you have ever seen a mount train in Dalararn you can see exclusive mounts. The only thing I dislike is the inconsistency.<br />

<br />
From the mount's wowhead page: &quot;This mount is given to Scarab Lord title holders who previously had the old model already. The new model is automatically added to your mount tab upon logging in. It is a second mount, it does NOT replace the old model. So Scarab Lords, enjoy a second exclusive mount. You can use the old model, the new model, or switch between both, to your own liking!&quot;<br />
<br />
So you simply log in and get a fresh new mount without doing ANYTHING because you are a special snowflake. When Blizzard updated the Raven Lord, they put a price tag on it with the CE, they didn't hand it out for free. When they updated the Wyverns and Gryphons, they made new content for them. But these where for the general population. When it comes to special snowflakes, the developers have their face so far up their asses it cuts the oxygen supply to their brains and they can't think straight anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same. <br />
<br />
It might sound like I'm bitter, but maybe I am. A cool NEW mount has been added to the game, and there's literally no way for me to get it, ever. <br />
<br />
It's a BRAND NEW award for doing NOTHING for a tiny select few players (the majority of which gained the original from realm swapping or other exploits) who already have one of the rarest mounts in the entire game, just because they don't feel they're special enough anymore. <br />
<br />
I mean, I've been playing for a decade so there's multiple times I could have used an exploit to get the Black War tank but I chose not to as, silly me, I thought people would get punished for that, not rewarded. <br />
<br />
I feel new content and models should be developed for new content and new achievements. There's no reason at all for this to have not been behind a new big achiement - maybe a meta for all the new single day holiday achievements, or maybe a multiple year achievement for the new Silithus event.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you simply log in and get a fresh new mount without doing ANYTHING because you are a special snowflake. When Blizzard updated the Raven Lord, they put a price tag on it with the CE, they didn't hand it out for free. When they updated the Wyverns and Gryphons, they made new content for them. But these where for the general population. When it comes to special snowflakes, the developers have their face so far up their asses it cuts the oxygen supply to their brains and they can't think straight anymore.<br />
But.. what if the developers ARE the special snowflakes that are getting this? :eek: DUN DUN DUUUUUUNNN</div></div><hr />

I'd like to believe they are not that crass.<br />
<br />
I think they simply overvalue high end players and their opinions and expectations because they used to be high end players too and now they are designers. In their minds, they are nurturing future employees or pillars of in game community (or simply people willing to test shit for them on the PTR for free). But that career path was more circumstantial than anything, it happened in a time when game development was young and you really had few places to prepare for it outside of playing games a lot.<br />
<br />
And special snowflakes with inflated egos wouldn't really be great potential designers. Most of them would sink the game faster than the Titanic judging by the opinions they express around here, since most of them hate and want to punish the casual player base that is the real cash cow of the game.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard didn't even invest extra time and resources, in creating this mount, as it already is a mob, they recreated for the game.<br />
So the only thing that you guys complain about, is that someone might get a mount, that you cannot get just because they must under no circumstances whatsoever, get anything better than you.<br />

they have your name and adress allready, they dont need your phone number...<br />
and no thats not how it works...<br />
also a SMS is MUCH more secure then NOTHING<br />
but an authenticator is EVEN MORE secure, and either are fine, but they promote the SMS because its FREE<br />

I wasnt handed shit. They updated the fucking model, do you people have any evidence that its a brand new mount and not a replacement? Regardless they have it cus they got the scarab lord title. SO fucking what if they got a updated version after 12 fucking years.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
You can play the game as long as you want but if you sit on your fat ass ans accomplish fuck all you should have fuck all, you should earn it all.<br />
<br />
yet it does not even give us the chance to earn it<br />
because they are giving people a reward for something not even they technically did, something a whole guild did just for them. that was done 12 years ago.<br />
people cant earn it, this new item is added and people who want it are told &quot;lol fucking get a time machine and go back 12 years&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Why do I need to have both the Authenticator and SMS Protector enabled in order to get the benefits? SMS is so easily spoofed and its so darn easy get access to someones phone number through social engineering so there is no added security by having both, you actually reduce the security compared to only having the authenticator..<br />
<br />
Unless they move to a three-factor authentication (which would be overkill for something like this) where one would need the password, authenticator and SMS-token it would make sense. But enforcing you to have the authenticator + SMS Protect doesn't make much sense from a security standpoint.<br />
<br />
You dont, idk why yours does but i was able to get mine just with the phsyical one<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
This... just doesn't make ANY sense. <br />
<br />
People are joking about &quot;where's my updated Zulian Tiger mount&quot;, but they have a point. There's no precedent for this, in fact the opposite, with older rare mounts getting newer reskins or releases. <br />
<br />
WHY give a brand new HD mount to people for a 10 year old achievement? They already have a cool looking mount from the reward they did, which is suitably different (and in my opinion still superior style wise). Why spend dev time to give a brand new ADDITIONAL mount to so few players that didn't even ask for it or need it. <br />
<br />
Blizzard also MUST know that 90%+ of the players that actually have it these days did so from exploits or realm swapping, so why reward that? Arguably, people with the Qiraji battle tank went through a MUCH bigger ordeal to get it than most of those with the black one now. <br />
<br />
It's just an incredibly bizzarre thing to do. Literally the ONLY POSSIBLE explanation I can come up with for why Blizzard thought this would be a good idea is that there is someone/some people on the Blizzard team with the old mount that wanted to GIVE THEMSELVES a new HD mount but didn't want anybody else to have it.<br />
<br />
like how most scarab lords you see these days got it in (i think it was wotlk) when the realms all bugged out and their gates were reset.</div></div><hr />

First: nice view of green here.<br />
<br />
Second i can actually quite understand it: scarab lord was a hard to earn achievement. Very very hard, helped my guild to open aq in the days.<br />
<br />
Third: Blizzard MIGHT unlock the mount once vanilla-servers are opening and if they manage to open AQ accountwide. Then even newer player have the chance to get it. <br />
<br />
Fourth: even if NOT. A reskin of a mount really doesn't take a lot of work. The HD-Upgrade of the mount itself is available to everyone, having put on a new color of skins is more a manner of minutes than a matter of hours; that's not really much of work.<br />
<br />
only for a short time though, and only useable in silithus</div></div><hr />

you are not joining the army to<br />
A. pay for this medal<br />
B. that medal was given to them back then, not a brand spanking new one made 50 years later (more resonable time for military to game dev)<br />
C. will not be 100% one of a kind<br />

Are you completely oblivious to the fact that it’s the idea behind the mount that matters? People associate it with that event and that’s the crux of the argument.<br />

people assosiate THIS MOUNT with the event <br />

Not all smartphones are expensive. You don't have to buy a Iphone or Samsung you know. There are third party brands that are cheap and work quite well.<br />
<br />
Then use a physical one. It's cheaper than a smartphone and lasts a long time. I've been using the same one since Cata. So 8 years.<br />

At the end of the day it's not like you NEED to do this. It's 4 bag spaces and a pet. It's an incentive for account security.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well you aren't forced to use one at all. Now if you were forced then you would be unable to log into Battle.net without one. <br />
<br />
What power advantage do you gain from 4 bag slots? It's a minor QoL reward for securing your account.<br />

Now if they gave you powerful gear that you couldn't get ingame and made you better than Mythic raiders now that would be bad form. But it's 4 measly slots.</div></div><hr />

Losing out on 4 bag spaces really isn't the end of the world. Let's not pretend it is shall we?<br />
<br />
So again you are not forced whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Forced as I said would be them requiring you to have an authenticator to log into Battle.net.<br />
<br />
I'm happy to discuss but saying you are forced into something you are clearly not is just not worth discussing.</div></div><hr />

Then use a physical one. It's cheaper than a smartphone and lasts a long time. I've been using the same one since Cata. So 8 years.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day it's not like you NEED to do this. It's 4 bag spaces and a pet. It's an incentive for account security.<br />
<br />
I didn't care either way about the 4 bag slots but I think it's shady that Blizzard has said all along you needed an authenticator attached. Now on patch release it changed to SMS protect. The authenticator which is 99.99% effective suddenly isn't good enough? That's my issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard should just let the other color variants of the bug mount to be USEABLE outside of the dungeon anyway. The title and black variant can stay for e-peen.<br />
Jeez, its a 12 year thing already. Outdated models.<br />
<br />
Still many would use them occasionally, but now NOBODY uses them cos they cant, or because only 7 player left with the scarab-lord title, and guess what, even those folks don’t want to use it with every char, every day with every xmog and so on…<br />
<br />
Not to mention that the freshness would quickly fade out after they lift the restriction on the blue/yellow/green/red models, and they would degrade into ordinary mount in 2 weeks.<br />
I don’t really care, have already more than enough mounts to choose from, but the dumbness of this case hurts my brain.<br />
<br />
<br />
And this +4 backpack lost for authenticators…. So smallscale. Sad. Like a guy waving with lollipops beside the opened backdoors of a van. :D</div></div><hr />

I will agree that adding in the SMS thing at last minute was a bit stupid. <br />

Should have just been either one of the authenticators.<br />

You can try and twist/trivialise it however you like, but the facts remains that an in game advantage is being given out as an incentive to use an authenticator, and that action directly penalises anyone who does not use an authenticator.</div></div><hr />

Yes and I normally vendor stuff to free up bagspace. <br />

And if anything you are twisting it to try and make it out like it's a bigger issue than it needs to be. You are not forced into an authenticator. But keep pretending you are.<br />

Now, I mean, it looks like it's from Cataclysm, so by that standard it's already a few years outdated, but it's a newer model.<br />
But yeah, I agree with your post. But I guess if you don't have a time machine, you're shit out of luck! :P<br />
<br />
It doesnt even look that bad to be honest but yeah this really stinks they could have made a great event only to shit on people who did not choose to use the Wrath exploit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They now cater to the 0,000000001% percent?<br />
<br />
How many Scarab Lords even play today? And how many of those are even the original owners of the account?<br />
<br />
Real as in OG scarab lords that did the event probably even less than people who raided old Naxx since the whole event itself weird in itself ring the gong in a set amount of time when some random person lunches the event wich mind you can bet at any time of the day or night. <br />

<br />
I shouldn't launch nuclear warheads? Give a good argument, beyond &quot;global annihilation and unfathomable suffering&quot; why starting a nuclear holocaust isn't a good idea.<br />
<br />
With very few exceptions and besides the air/ground divide all mounts are the same gameplay wise. Prestige is one of the essential part in chosing one ground mount over the other. The other being aesthetic preference obviously.<br />
No, I know that prestige in itself can be a good thing.<br />
<br />
But I need an argument besides &quot;muh prestige!&quot; as to why this entirely new model, with new textures and a new design should go straight to Scarab Lords for the sake of preserving their prestige, when their prestige got directly stomped on already by letting WoTLK Scarab Lords keep their mount and by introducing the Cataclysm Ultramarine Qiraji Battle Tank for Archaeologists.<br />
<br />
Those two cases are far more heinous for the simple reasons that:<br />
<br />
1. The people who got it in WoTLK got it for a literal fraction of the effort.<br />
2. The Cataclysm Qiraji is literally the same model with a different color.<br />
<br />
Whereas this is a new model with new textures and a new design and without any armor at all, and the only way in which it's similar is that it's supposed to be the same type of creature with the same color scheme. That's where the similarities end, and only a blind person would be able to confuse the two.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
so... NOT &quot;Literally get the same mount model&quot;<br />
because it is a VERY DIFFERENT model<br />
My point is that the Netherdrake rep drakes are 10 times more similar to the Gladiator Netherdrakes than this Qiraji mount is to the original Black Qiraji Battle Tank.<br />
<br />
The Gladiator Netherdrakes share the same model and textures as the rep ones, except they have armor.<br />
<br />
This new Qiraji Battle Tank has no armor, is a whole new model, with a whole new textureset.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Says who being a scarab lord doesnt entitle you to a new model. Blizzard wanted to update the model they did. Now you kids are butthurt beyond compare that you cant have it. Your not entitled to earn it just cus blizzard rebuilt a old mount in new graphics for the few that are still playing with it. Get the fuck over it.<br />
I'm entitled to have the ability to earn it because they developed it with my and other current players' subscription money in their pockets. Things that are created today should be obtainable today, not randomly given out to a group of people that either were privileged enough to have their guild get them something over a decade ago, or cheesed it an expansion or more down the line when they could cheese it.<br />
<br />
So I won't &quot;get the fuck over it.&quot; I will continue giving my legitimate criticism, and you will &quot;get the fuck over it.&quot;.</div></div><hr />

There are so few Scarab Lords any more and you can't even get the title anymore. On top of that, I remember in TBC when the original mount &quot;bugged out&quot; and got a flying form. The Scarab Lords were excited while everyone else was pissed. Blizzard then came out shortly after to say it was an error and the mount would not be getting a flying form. <br />
This just goes to show Blizzard is trying to backpedal on everything. That's just crap to continue to award players for something they got like 10 years ago. That's just not fair, especially when the other mounts most players can get last only a week.<br />
<br />
The only way I can see Blizzard avoiding pissing people off with this is by making Scarab Lord accessible again either through the Call of the Scarab event or by having players who get it on the Vanilla servers able to also have it on live.</div></div><hr />

It's even more stupid that these individuals are getting a new mount for literally no reason. They didn't work for it at all. <br />

Also, a little correction: his guild worked their ass off twelve years ago.

Thus making Scarab Lord a nice bait for more people to actively play Vanilla for a while and to justify the extra cost a vocal minority wouldn't be able to support by itself, but shutting them up in the process.<br />

They're actually one of the few server &quot;celebrities&quot; I can remember from vanilla, as they were very active in the server community even outside of being the Scarab Lord.<br />
<br />
So they spent dev/art time on making a new mount for maybe a handful of active players (I'd be very surprised if the amount of active players with this mount is above 100, and even that might be generous). Note, none of those people earned this new mount, they earned the original mount and title. They still have their title/mount/achievement for the prestige, so giving them an entirely new mount just because really seems like a waste of time. If Scarab Lords made up a much larger portion of the active player base (like Mythic raider or Gladiator numbers) then sure, I could see it. But there are probably more active players with the Tyrael pet then there are active Scarab Lords.</div></div><hr />

You expect that if its in the game you should be able to get it.<br />

funny thing is. i helped people get that mount 3 times.<br />
i spent maybe up to 100 hours twice in vanilla helping our GM and his wife get it, then recently a guy on a private server, maybe 150 hours<br />

Greetings from a Scarablord who's enjoying his mount!<br />
<br />
yes it is not avaiable to everyone, cause you can literally only fucking use it for 2 days in silithus... are you seriously saying that a mount that can ONLY EVER BE USED 2 DAYS A YEAR IN ONE ZONE is at all comparable to one that can be used anywhere you want, any time?<br />
<br />

<br />
Why would they make a new mount for the 0.5% of players with the title?<br />
<br />
lolol it is much less then 0.5% of players<br />
lets say 3 million players<br />
30,000 is 1%<br />
there is not 15,000 people with it, there is about one hundred, and most of them got it from an exploit in WOTLK<br />
s its more of 0.00001%<br />

It was always stupid that only the gong ringer got this title and mount, when they assuredly did not do all the work themselves. They had probably at least 39 other people working their asses off to help, and those people got jack squat. The work people bleating about was propped up by the work of countless other people who aren't acknowledged at all. The jerks earlier in the thread don't even mention the fact that they were part of a team, which kinda illustrates their insanely selfish nature. <br />
<br />
It's even more stupid that these individuals are getting a new mount for literally no reason. They didn't work for it at all. <br />
<br />
Stupid decisions are about the only ones WoW knows how to make anymore, though. So. C'est la vie.<br />
<br />
yeah i have done it three times, i really think if blizzard brings it back, it should be a guild wide thing, or something, it will be hard to make it so it cant simply be sold.<br />
but maybe replace the bug thing instead of turn in XXXX fragments have it be a quest &quot;kill 20,000 bugs&quot; and once completed all the rest of the quest can be completed just by killing, no need to loot, so everyone who helped can do it, without simply just giving everyone in the group it.<br />

Yeah, you worked your ass off TWELVE YEARS AGO. That doesn't mean that you and the handful of other Scarab Lords that still play deserve ANOTHER mount in your collection for doing literally nothing extra. You have your prestige. This mount should be modern prestige, not decade-old prestige. You really need to evaluate your ego.<br />
<br />
to be fair it wasent that one person alone who worked their ass off. 40+ people did, but only ONE of them got the mount.</div></div><hr />

no it shouldnt. And your mentality as iv said before is why wow is shit now compared to what it used to be, a horde of casuals with that mentality have ruined this game and made blizzard cave to the point of alienating the people that drove and made news in this game. You may not like the people that were in the top end of wow but they were the ones that made the headlines gaming or news wise. They were the ones that brought in new people or gave people a drive to do somthing. I see a fraction of those people around. most servers have one guild thats pushing end game if that, heaps are barren wastelands. Population got so low blizzard doesnt even announce it out of fear of being laughed at.</div></div><hr />

An extra reward (on top of their already unique exclusive mount and title) for getting carried by their guild to it 10+ years ago, or again, by exploiting bugged servers after Classic.</div></div><hr />

If they made two new models. One with armor, one without.<br />

The mentallity that they need to earn somthing to receive is not wrong. The mentallity that you are owed somthing in a game cus the developer made it and put it into the game is what is wrong. They dont have to give you shit, they can make 100 mounts, implement them and put them in game and they dont have to let you have a single fucking one.<br />

Get it through your thick skull that I am not talking about the original. No one is talking about the original. No one wants the original, and no one is asking to get the original. They didn't work for the new one, Blizzard didn't promise them a new one. They worked for the original mount and title. They still have that, and it's still exclusive.<br />
<br />
We are talking about a NEW MOUNT MODEL that was developed in 2017, not in Classic, and it was never a part of that event. The original Battle Tank, Classic players paid to have developed and they all had a shot at earning it. This one was developed by currently playing and paying players and none of them except old Scarab Lords can have it.<br />
<br />
If they make it off my dime, whether it's easy, hard or nearly impossible to get, they should give me and anyone else paying for a subscription the opportunity to get it. Whether it's a limited time opportunity before or after BfA, or an easy grab from a questline that will be around forever.</div></div><hr />

So, no current subscriber ever played in Vanilla or Wrath? That's an interesting, yet completely stupid, thing to say.<br />

This. Still waiting for that updated Netherdrake mount for only TBC Gladiators, since I'm pretty sure being a TBC Gladiator is now far more prestigious than being a Scarab Lord, after the WoTLK cheesing event.</div></div><hr />

How many times are they going to keep awarding players for doing content when it's current? I'm not getting or expecting anything beyond what was available in-game when I did the current content from TBC to MoP. I'm satisfied with the rewards that were in-game back then and I find it insanely stupid to keep focusing on this event when there's not been anything resembling it in-game ever since and it's a thing of the past. Can we move on to the present and future, please? Brazenly gloating about a past event (that by all account was a shitty lagfest) repeatedly and bringing attention to the few loud hotcakes comes at the cost of those you alienate. It's an excellent example of why any rewards have to be shared with everyone who put in the playtime. How many of the scarab-lords pals and other players on the server are still playing who helped out with it all like everyone else leading to that single player getting mount and title? Those who were still around to cheese it in wotlk? <br />
Give exclusive mounts away single-time-only to new subs or returning players each month and watch players rage because they too deserve it for playing. They can make the game so we all come out as winners but it's much more fun servicing snowflakes on issues that have nothing to do with gameplay so they can strut around and rub it in the face of the players around them because why use something obtainable when you got unobtainable trash and can act like you've never grown out of the sandbox looking to always one-up everyone around you -.-' Downright obnoxious to contend with this atmosphere sometimes... Just see this thread. When players are divided and at each others throats blizz can breathe a sigh of relief instead.<br />

The problem with it feeling good is that it's just objectively not. You said it yourself, it was cheesed it WotLK and it actually isn't all that difficult to do, more than anything required timing.<br />
<br />
It's this kind of exclusive mundane shit that people like him exalt to the mountains when it fundamentally means nothing other than the dopamine release in their brains. It's pathetic and designing the game around it shows Blizzard cares more about their whales than their consumers.<br />
<br />
Truth. This is how you keep them subbed and in the shop spending their money on merch in/game and irl. While defending blizz like a white knight on drugs.</div></div><hr />

You know technically, the people who have played the longest have invested more money in the game than newer players.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's not true, there's literally 2 or 3 players that play since vanilla, the rest resubed when Legion came which is different from my case that I've been subbing since late cataclysm nonstop</div></div><hr />

That doesn't mean that you and the handful of other Scarab Lords that still play deserve ANOTHER mount in your collection for doing literally nothing extra. You have your prestige. This mount should be modern prestige, not decade-old prestige. You really need to evaluate your ego.<br />
<br />
I was just giving an example of my thinking. I actually never got the mount, but I understand how it must feel like to have it. And I hate to break it to you, MMORPGs are all about ego and prestige. If you can't handle some people being better than you, tough.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocc08f238cef</div><div class="date">2018-01-20, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy shit salty comments for days. While I do agree that WotLK Scarab Lords dont deserve this mount... the original ones (like myself) DO deserve it. It was extremely diffucult back then to complete the questchain and required insane amount of effort and dedication with your realm + your guild. Even the WotLK ones had to go through the trouble to finish it. It wasn't easy dude. 80 it was relatively way easier the 60.. but still.. don't expect people to just complete the questchain without coordination and effort.<br />
<br />
Level 60 Scarab Lords are the most prestigious mount and title holders in WoW. Nothing comes close, not even R1. <br />
<br />
Level 80 ones were lucky, very lucky and don't really deserve the title and mount imo. So I agree with you there.<br />
<br />
But don't neglect the other 5% who DID get it at 60.<br />
<br />
This is a nice change for people who did get the title and mount... because the Ultramarine Qiraji Tank took a little bit of our shine away. Nobody even notices my Black Tank because people who never seen the black one, mistake it with the blue one. Its so stupid. Not to mention, this is a nice update that goes very well with the Call of Scarab Event.<br />
<br />
Don't speak like you were around at that time... and actually took part in the questchain at 60. You had your shot at 80, you missed it! The ones who got it at 80 were the smart ones and some actually finished the questchain at level 70 even before the new servers were opened.<br />
<br />
You guys are such whiny crybaby morons man. Don't be that jealous. You never had a chance at it, even if you played around in Classic. It was only 1-2 per realm.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eapoe</div><div class="date">2018-01-20, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't be deliberately obtuse.<br />
<br />
The old qiraji mount was developed in Classic WoW. People then, paid for its development and they also had the opportunity (however slim) to obtain it then.<br />
<br />
The new qiraji mount was developed in 2017, people, now, paid for its development, and they never had the opportunity (however slim), to obtain it.<br />
<br />
Still not understanding your point. Does that mean that only people who played Warcraft: Orcs vs Humans have the right to play WoW since they were the only people that &quot;paid&quot; to develop it?<br />
People that earned Scarab Lord and have played since have spent way more on this game then someone who has played since any xpac after.<br />
Does that mean every item in the cash shop should be free since we paid for its development, and only have access thru real money? Should current players not have access to t3 gear or the Zulian tiger from the BMAH since they couldn't/didn't earn it while current?<br />
Do you get mad that Blizzard puts money into Hearthstone, OW, D3, and any other property they make or don't finish because you don't play them? After all, that's your money, right?<br />
You are still acting like you are under the impression no one who ever played vanilla still plays the game, or that they have been playing for free all these years. <br />
As stated, it's a perk to go to long standing customers that earned something (whether trivial or not), and on a personal level I'd love for all the bickering over it to stop as Blizz may become more inclined to reward things like this further down the road to people that earned the equivalent to Ahead of the Curve achieves, or achieves for timed runs in ZG.<br />
It's a bonus perk meant to reward, and instead of being happy for people that have continued to support Blizzard and do something that occurred years ago, people complain and moan that they don't get one. It's sad and entitlement at its finest.<br />
Hell, would you be happy if Scarab Lords got this for free while everyone else had access thru the cash shop or a 3 million gold price tag? Probably not. More than likely we would be subjected to a different forum of people bitching and complaining they have to pay while others get it free.</div></div><hr />

dude.... players in the game get rewards continuously. Every fucking patch, you can get new stuff and get rewarded new stuff.<br />
Don't compare Scarab Lord to newschool stuff pls. Scarab Lord is a different ballgame.<br />
<br />
I didn't see you get Scarab Lord at 60. Nor 80. I also don't see you having the achievement ''Veteran of the Shifting Sands''<br />
You are literally complaining about content you never did. Pls stop crying, and focus on new things.</div></div><hr />

Lmao implying Scarab Lord is hard compared to heroic (pre MoP) and mythic (post-MoP) raids we are tackling more recently.<br />
<br />

I wonder how many people who got Scarab Lord are still actually playing the game. I assume a fraction of the total, I mean a fraction of a single digit of all wow players will suddenly get a mount just cause. Which just seems odd is all.<br />
<br />
Total amount of Scarab Lords including WotLK transfers/rerollers/dupes under 0.0%.<br />
<br />
Total amount of Original Scarab Lords from Classic (2008 Achievement Date) less then 0.00%.<br />
<br />
My guess is around 20 Original Scarab Lords play in EU atm (including me) and around 25 to 30 maybe in US. (US had more realms at Vanilla launch so its common that they have more Scarab Lords there)<br />
<br />
The WotLK Scarab Lords is in the 150+ for both US and EU. Those that have the 2009 Achievement date.<br />
<br />
It's not odd. Blizzard is tying this up with the Call of Scarab Event. This event is dedicated to the ones who did it back in Classic. So it's only natural that they rewards us with a permanent updated model mount. Altho I do agree to some extent that they should have picked the ones that did it at 60 instead of the total amount of Scarab Lords including the 80 ones. Because ofc that consists of 95%. Only 5% of that total pool did it legit.<br />
<br />
Even the total amount of players who got ''Veteran of the Shifting Sands'' achievement is still around 0.9 - 1%.<br />
<br />
So only 1% or less completed the questchain that persisted from Vanilla all the way to the launch of Cataclysm. (after 3.0.9, february 2009 of course, all realms started with gates open so nobody could participate in the event anymore after this point of time).</div></div><hr />

I just want to clarify because I'm sensing some misinterpretation (maybe it's me). What I'm saying is: Day 1 - today player has invested more money than a player who has started after him. I feel like you think I'm saying &quot;all the vanilla players no matter their actual sub time have invested more money than the new players&quot; though I could be wrong and misreading it. I'm not talking about vanilla players as a group just &quot;the guy&quot; who has been playing since the start compared to the guy who started at some expansion after him.<br />
