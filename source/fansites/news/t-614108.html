Arena Season 4 - Brutal Gladiator Nether Drake<br />
For some reasons, the latest build of WotLK beta introduced the model of the season 4 flying mount in the game files. Below is the first preview of the Brutal Nether Drake. <br />

Mana regeneration &quot;too good&quot; in beta<br />
Nobody seems to be having problems with mana in Naxx right now (maybe Ret pallies), but I think that's because regen is too good across the board. I wouldn't use that experience (yet) to determine that you have enough Spirit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/9679908318-tons-of-spirit-on-the-naxx-balance-gear.html))<br />

Mana regeneration as a mage<br />
I hear your concerns about Spirit (and the Moonkin ones too) and it's something we are discussing. We don't really expect a mage to stand around waiting for FSR to kick in often. I was trying to stress that casters were sort of allowed to opt out of worrying about mana in order to just do more damage throughout a lot of BC. But managing mana is supposed to be a part of playing the class well. You have some mana related tools already, and we will discuss talents that benefit Spirit or else trying to strip some off the gear. <br />

Metamorphosis Feedback<br />
While this is not final and could absolutely change, here is what we're thinking about for the new design:<br />
You keep your pet.<br />
You keep your spells.<br />
It buffs spell damage (for that &quot;blow your cooldowns&quot; feel).<br />
It buffs mitigation (you could even tank for a bit).<br />
It provides the current snare reduction for PvP.<br />
You'll still get a few fun demon abilities, but you can just use your normal spells if you'd rather. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/9679890957-metamorphosis-feedback.html))</div></div><hr />

that don't make sense. many have preorderd warhammer.. many want to test warhammer no matter what.<br />

the trick would be to bring the patch when people have to decide if they want to continue playing after their free month.</div></div><hr />

The only thing WAR has going for it is the RvR, which is actually somewhat balanced and fun -- compared to WoW.

The preorder crowd can only be so big. If I was blizz I would like to avoid another 1 month interruption like Age of Conan. I personally bought AoC after about a week of it being out because 2 friends were telling me how great it was. They both also bought AoC non-preorder. Just saying, it makes sense, give the WoW fans a taste of the bridge patch be it in PTR, which will last them til the bridge patch release, which will last them til Wrath.</div></div><hr />

That has me slightly concerned. If there is a class that has never had a free ride on its own regarding mana is mages. Probably the most useless class without mana and the one most mana bound - hell, even during leveling the ratio of activity to drinking is quite high. During raids, no SP, no mage.<br />
<br />
Spirit is the &quot;boosted&quot; stat in WotLK, like stamina was in BC. Now, mages only benefit from spirit because of mana regen - and actually only arcane mages do that in a significant way, unless they want to lose damage. And arcane is looking a bit bleak atm. So, in the end, Spirit becomes a &quot;meeh, don't like it&quot; stat for mages, like it was during TBC. <br />
<br />
Still back to TBC, blues actually sugested (implied) for mages &quot;have mana issues - gear spirit&quot;. They actually lost the argument because their knowledge of the class was inferior to the players (the implied &quot;gearing spirit gems&quot; was one of the most stupid sugestions ever... the poor blue got a lot of flak for it - but he diserved it anyway).<br />
<br />
The one &quot;free mana&quot; DPS caster is locks, not mages. Which benefited a lot from stamina (double benefit from HP and LT) and now are also going to double dip into spirit (mana and sp dmg) - not bad, from zero to double benefit. Now, if a year or two from now a blue comes and says &quot;the destro lock scaling was higher than expected&quot;, we can have a nice laugh of their perceptiveness.<br />
<br />
Finally, it seems that they reached the &quot;polish phase&quot; on the mage class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That mages need to worry more about mana etc ok, i'm fine with that.<br />
<br />
But then let ALL the casters worry about it. And surprise surprise, warlocks don't have to in WotLK. Next to Life Tap their armor now gives 30% of mana regen uring casting on top of their +180 spellpower +spellpower based on a percentage of your spirit.<br />
<br />
When it comes to mana problems, all classes solve it by chucking pots. But 1 doesn't.</div></div><hr />

That seems very obvious to me, doesn't it ?<br />
<br />
Naxxramas level 60 was once a part of World of Warcraft. People raided the dungeon and got items from it. Although those items will now 'vanish' from the game by having no opportunity to obtain them anymore, the ones who currently have a version of the 'old' Naxxramas items stocked on their character would, with your suggestion, suddenly gain the level 80 epic version(s) ? :P<br />
<br />
That's why all the items from 'the old' Naxxramas, including the item sets, are being renamed. Genius.* :-*</div></div><hr />
