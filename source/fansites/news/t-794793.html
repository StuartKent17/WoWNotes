Rested XP before Cataclysm<br />
Rested experience will be reset at launch. You will start at 0 rested. <br />

<br />
Cataclysm Factions Pages<br />
I wanted to wait the release of Patch 4.0.3a before pushing the rest of the Cataclysm content to avoid confusions on what is/isn't released but I assume that factions pages won't do any hurt. This is a first draft, I might add more information before the actual release of the expansion.<br />

Remember they want everyone to be waiting on cata, if just a few days ago we got a bunch of new shit for free the numbers for day 1 sales might not be as high because everyone already has new azeroth and a new character to play with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For many of us not in the beta, the Shattering is in effect the expansion launch. Sure there's no 80-85 content and no Goblins/Worgen, but the meat of the expansion will probably be two weeks before launch. Just won't make launch night as epic.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, and that is so lame. It's annoying but somewhat understandable when RNG determines certain things in the game, such as drops. But when RNG affects lore and being able to experience content, that is just too much. RNG should not affect my experience of something that is completely based on the lore! A special in-game event that gets you nothing but the satisfaction of being able to see it with your own eyes and an achievement that means NOTHING because it is META GAME! This is total crap!</div></div><hr />

Someone mentioned that the new Hodir-esque faction (Therazane) has a tabard making that particular grind easier (since you can do dungeons for the rep whereas before the implementation of using Emblems of Triumph to buy rep with Hodir you only had your daily quests and Everfrost Chips to boost rep) so I'm just curious if anyone has any experience on which reps have more/less daily quests to do, or have just plain more quests to do for the rep?<br />

When the shattering goes live, all of the changes will be there. What is stated in the blue post is that Deathwing will randomly hit a zone and breathe fire and wreck havoc periodically. This is not changing the zone, this is just Deathwing making a random appearance and saying hello to whoever is around.</div></div><hr />

You know, he could just show up and bring a six-pack, chill out, and watch the football game....but all this fire-breathing stuff, that's not a nice way to say &quot;hello.&quot; Just saying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're pretty much getting 90% of the game before release, again, what's the point? I want a new game when I buy a new game, not just the ability to use stuff I already downloaded last month but whatever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you're expecting a little too much from the game if you think Deathwing will fly over each zone and it will then turn into a new one infront of your eyes once he has finished setting fire to it.. :) All of the changes will be there the moment the servers come back up. Deathwing will then be flying around the world setting fire to lots of stuff. But the world changes will all be there. I think all the Blue post meant to suggest was don't stand in one place expecting Deathwing to appear within an hour of you arriving.. chances are he won't because he has too much ground to cover.<br />
<br />
Think of it as like waking up one morning to discover during the night death wing broke free, went on a rampage and you're now seeing the results... and he is still on his rampage in other parts of the world. But all of the changes and new quests will all be there when you wake up.<br />

We're pretty much getting 90% of the game before release, again, what's the point? I want a new game when I buy a new game, not just the ability to use stuff I already downloaded last month but whatever.<br />
<br />
The expansions have always been just a key you type into your account to allow access to more levels and new zones. Even with BC and WOTLK the new talents, professions and all that stuff were all in the game prior to the expansion being released. That is the nature of an online game where expansions are a choice, not a mandatory requirement. They can't hold back talent changes for Cataclysm because what happens if someone doesn't want to buy Cataclysm? They're stuck with the old talents while Cataclysm players have all the new ones? That would never work. So they have to present all players with the core game changes and then allow access to more levels and more zones to those who decide to buy the expansion.<br />
<br />
If it were impossible to play WoW without buying Cataclysm then your idea would probably work. But while expansions are choice purchases, they have to enable the entire player base to be playing with the same rules and tools.</div></div><hr />

<br />
even tho there's links directly IN the news post of what is coming what is leaving and what not to expect.<br />
<br />
new zones WITH new quests<br />
DWing randomly scorching people in random zones dosnt &quot;change&quot; the zone, he just does it, him coming out of deepholm is what &quot;changed&quot; the zone, which clearly he's out if he's flying around :p<br />
<br />
you will not be able to faction/race change to one of the new combos (lookin @ you Mr Belf Warrior) you WILL be able to make a new belf warrior, but changing an existing character to the new combo's is disabled untill Cata's launch.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and for those WTF MMO report posts: Casey is doing a mock of Glenn Beck, if you're fortunate enough to not know who he is, I envy you, he's a personification of 90% of whats wrong with America (and Im American)</div></div><hr />

Are people just looking at the colour and saying it uses the same colour on the site as the BoA items?<br />
<br />
Also a bit surprised that the head enchants from the factions are BoA but the shoulder enchants from Therazane are BoP. However I actually think this is good at the start of the expansion to avoid people constantly switching main at the start.<br />
<br />
And I want to DLC :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
You realize he was talking about krayt dragons which are from the KotoR MMO and people go on him because he said in an earlier MMO report &quot;no dragons in KotoR&quot; so this is a response to those people who think they are dragons which I agree with him they are lizards not dragons.<br />
<br />
also did not see anything about politics, sure he was copying glenn becks BS but he didn't mock him for his political beliefs.</div></div><hr />

That was actually amusing.<br />

note, when other tv/web personalities mock you, it means your doing something right.</div></div><hr />

Aren't GoH connected to the Cenarion Expedition? So that would stand to reason, tbh.</div></div><hr />

Dude calm down,<br />
<br />
That was no way political, it was just a Casey parodying Glenn Beck which is okay, cause you know, freedom of speech and fair use. I know I'm probably going to get flamed for saying this, but I like Glenn Beck and I'm a tea party supporter (problem democrats?). Even I found that hysterical. You just need to chill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Druids, paladins, priests, and shaman will have their talent trees reset&quot;<br />
<br />
WHYYYY?! THOSE ARE ALL MY 80S! These are also all of the healing classes. Are these the &quot;final&quot; builds from Beta being implemented? <br />
<br />
I truly look forward to spending the first half hour of patch respeccing...Not.<br />
<br />
Sidenote: People stop crying about the newness of your game being ruined...As a few intelligent people have already pointed out, new players and players who do not purchase the expansion need to be able to see the new changes to the world as well as have the final talent builds from beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also belive they had to do that, because some people wont have expension yet, lets say someone just started playing and are not 80 yet.</div></div><hr />
