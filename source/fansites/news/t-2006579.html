Blizzard Adding Facebook Login and Facebook Live Streaming<br />
Blizzard Entertainment and Facebook are working together to provide gamers around the world with new ways to connect and share their gaming experiences, while bringing more high-demand entertainment content to Facebook’s global platform.<br />
<br />
The companies announced today that a major step in their ongoing collaboration will begin later this month with the integration of Facebook Login in Blizzard’s PC games. This will enable players to sign up for and log in to games such as World of Warcraft®, Heroes of the Storm®, Hearthstone®, Diablo® III, StarCraft® II, and Blizzard’s most recent blockbuster release, Overwatch®, using their Facebook accounts.<br />
<br />
Adding Facebook Login will pave the way for new social functionality in Blizzard games while highlighting Facebook’s capabilities as a platform for sharing, viewing, and discussing AAA game content. As an example, Blizzard is in the process of incorporating Facebook’s Live API in order to create its own “Go Live” streaming functionality for its games. When this functionality is implemented, players will for the first time be able to livestream their Blizzard-gaming sessions directly to their Facebook timelines, and friends will be able to subscribe and be notified when new streams are available.<br />
<br />
“Blizzard games are best when played with friends, so it’s important to us to provide our players with features and services that make it easy and fun to share their experiences with each other,” said Gio Hunt, executive vice president of corporate operations at Blizzard Entertainment. “We’re working closely with Facebook on this integration for Overwatch, as well as our other games, and we look forward to sharing further details on our plans as development progresses.”<br />
<br />
As part of the collaboration between the two companies, Blizzard recently hosted multiple livestreams via Facebook. The first series of streams centered on Heroes of the Dorm™, Blizzard’s collegiate tournament featuring its popular team-brawler Heroes of the Storm. Last week, Blizzard hosted a livestreamed launch event for Overwatch on Facebook.<br />
<br />
“Blizzard has a passionate community of players, and an incredible track record for launching innovative and high-quality gaming experiences,” said Leo Olebe, global games partnerships director at Facebook. “Our collaboration on Overwatch demonstrates Facebook’s commitment to partnering with AAA game companies, while further empowering Blizzard gamers to connect and share the content they're most passionate about with the friends they play with around the world.”<br />
<br />
In preparation for the Overwatch launch, Facebook worked with Blizzard on a comprehensive mix of Facebook and Instagram marketing solutions—including Carousel ads, Canvas, and Instagram Marquee. Using the platforms’ powerful targeting capabilities, Facebook helped Blizzard present the game to a broad set of gaming and entertainment audiences within Facebook’s and Instagram's global audiences of 1.65 billion and 400 million people respectively. On Facebook, more than 650 million people play games connected to Facebook every month across web, mobile, and console.</div></div><hr />

This cant be good news, it means further down the line we will have patches that dont have in game content but upgrade features to their new facebook partnership or the likes, kind of reminds me of the selfie cam patch lol</div></div><hr />

considering facebook has roughly 1 billion users each day logging into the social media platform, with an average time of 50 minutes spent browsing daily, it is definitely a thing. Sorry to burst your edgy bubble. Get some friends and then you'll understand the appeal of facebook</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be expected. People who log into Twitch are typically gamers who don't mind logging into multiple systems to access their games. Blizzard is pushing a lot of their stuff, especially the new expansion of WoW, onto the general public (what with the movie offers and whatnot). Adding Facebook functionality cuts down a barrier between the finicky nature of the general public who may be used to accessing their games of Farmville or Candy Crush via one-button access on Facebook itself. This seems like a pretty natural progression.</div></div><hr />

That sounds reasonable. Nothing Adblock cant fix. I was assuming ads popping up in youre connected to Facebook while in the game, or using Facebook to stream.</div></div><hr />

Looks like about as many years as it's taken you to come up with something original and interesting to offer, besides this same tired, worn-out joke.<br />
<br />
Oh, look - you didn't. What a surprise.<br />
<br />
My opinion? I don't care what they integrate. If you don't like it, don't use it. Lots of other games and sites have already done this. Big whoop.</div></div><hr />

You know there is more than just WoW right? There is Starcraft, Hearthstone, Overwatch. I'd say WoW is small compared to advertising the other games. After 11 years, who hasn't tried WoW already? This is about all the &quot;other&quot; games. With 7 million Overwatch players, I'd say it is more of the focus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
n preparation for the Overwatch launch, Facebook worked with Blizzard on a comprehensive mix of Facebook and Instagram marketing solutions<br />
<br />
I have heard this sentence a lot in my job, (I do digital marketing at an agency as a fairly high lvl director). This basically means Facebook went to see Blizzard and sold them some advertising products without any auditing / verifying by a third party. So basically Facebook took them out for a dinner and Blizzard didn't start comparing media costs of formats etc (they are focusing on video, which is the worse and most expensive on Facebook.... so clearly no one has a clue at Blizzard digital marketing department..).<br />
<br />
Another way of seeing it, is they went to the AH without any addons, sorted by highest cost and clicked Buyout.<br />
<br />
Now because I am a WOW, overwatch and HotS player, I notice their ads. I also have an account where i like games but not these ones.<br />
The Blizzard ads are very badly targeted (I get one ad a day telling me to log in, when I log in on all three games everyday. They could exclude me from the targeting using my email address and save a LOT of cash). <br />
But they stupidly only target Fans of one of the brand, which means their marketing is only aimed at existing customers - not prospects. Ridiculous strategy, only benefits Facebook.<br />
<br />
Another way of seeing it, is that they are not opening up the advertising to the masses. (Maybe they learnt this from LFR ?)<br />
<br />
Facebook's long term plan is live video, but they never knew how to make it happen. It seems they are now going to try the streaming thing because Twitch belongs to Google. (Google and Facebook are competitors). <br />
<br />
From a professional's point of view : terrible decisions<br />
From a player point of view : I don't want to stream games on my real identity, thank you very much, i'll do it on Twitch where the community already exists.<br />
<br />
EDIT : Half my friends on Facebook don't know I game (as much as I do). I suspect I'm not the only one. The real identity thing is a blocker</div></div><hr />

How is it any different to streaming on Youtube or Twitch? People can subscribe to the person streaming, but it's not pointing out who's in the stream.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not a problem in itself. It is a problem when companies, like EA did, choose to do a quick mod on the game to pander to minorities when the overall state of the game is seriously poor and could use some serious attention, instead of trying to salvage some little PR from a game unworthy of continuing the legacy of The Sims 1 and 2.</div></div><hr />

Does it really affect you in any way, shape or form? No? OK, then move on.<br />

Also, as long as this was worked on by a new team that wasn't currently working on anything else in WoW and other Blizzard games I am fine with it. I won't use it, since I use Twitch for streaming.. but still not bad.<br />

<br />
1.) This is more than just streaming; it is sharing content thru Facebook + Facebook login for Blizz games.<br />
<br />
2.) More people on x !== more content.<br />
<br />
So, no, it's pretty cool overrall. It doesn't hurt content and enables more exposure for Blizz games whilst making them more accessible via the upcoming Facebook login; potentially this means anyone with Facebook has just been given one less obstacle to partaking in Blizzard games, whilst at the same time Blizzard have eased the ability to share content from Blizz games on Fb.<br />
<br />
None of this harms anyone guys, exposure for Blizzard games is good.</div></div><hr />

Yes, yes, very clever. Have a medal.<br />
<br />
WoW has an attempt at voice chat which is low quality and failed horribly. No one uses it, do you? You're probably the only one.<br />
<br />
The point is that they are redoing it across Bnet with the OW quality/style in their other games. This was announced a while ago. Will soon be integrated properly into Bnet. The shitty half-assed TBC voice chat does not count :)</div></div><hr />

Or do you just wanna drone for them a bit?<br />
<br />
Who says this integration is not paving the way for future twitch integration?<br />
<br />
Who says absolutely 0 people wanted it? Based on what data?<br />
<br />
People said the same about twitter integration and the selfie cam, and in the end there are indeed people who use and enjoy those things. Chances are just like pet battles and twitter integration this was a low priority side project done by people who otherwise wouldn't really be helping in &quot;main&quot; features much.<br />
<br />
And no lol, I don't really enjoy or use twitter integration, nor will I particularly enjoy or use facebook integration eitger, nor twitch integration if they get to it.<br />
But I do realize my opinion/taste isn't shared by everyone, and I do realize I don't get promoted into their decision maker and beloved god just because I throw a couple bucks a month at them.</div></div><hr />

WoW has an attempt at voice chat which is low quality and failed horribly. No one uses it, do you? You're probably the only one.<br />
<br />
The point is that they are redoing it across Bnet with the OW quality/style in their other games. This was announced a while ago. Will soon be integrated properly into Bnet. The shitty half-assed TBC voice chat does not count :)<br />
<br />
Can confirm, better quality than WoW Voice Chat. Still listed as Alpha 1-7 (5/10/2016), updated alongside a &quot;Unified Authentication for the Battle.net Desktop App.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Why would that be? Why do you feel the need to &quot;morally defend&quot; Blizzard? Do you somehow see them as an extension of your identity?<br />
<br />
How am I triggered? I expressed my opinion. You're the one immediately blasting out insults and going 'LOL you think differently than I do, you must be bandwagoning!'. I listed a series of facts:<br />
<br />
1. If you don't like something, you don't have to do it. Don't connect to FB. Don't play WoW. Don't eat oranges.<br />
<br />
2. Blizzard is not going to require Facebook Connect. Not everyone has Facebook. They're not, contrary to popular belief, stupid.<br />
<br />
3. Blizzard has many different people working on many different projects. Making this deal and implementing it did not pull away from other projects.<br />
<br />
4. Blizzard has been marketing to the masses for a very long time. TV spots with famous personalities. Super Bowl commercials. Ads on Google Adworks. This is no different than any of that. Like every company, they want people to buy their product.<br />
<br />
5. While native Twitch integration is not a thing for Blizzard games, Blizzard game players have been streaming to Twitch for years. Blizzard has never blocked this capability and probably never will. But given a choice between a platform that only reaches gamers and a platform that reaches practically everyone, which would you choose to market your game?<br />
<br />
6. Everytime Blizzard makes an announcement, people rush to social media, MMOChamp, and the forums to immediately start hating on it. This isn't unique to Blizzard - every single customer-oriented company has to deal with this, from major chain stores to restaraunts to gaming companies. We live in a society that can express its opinion immediately, and so does. This is not opinion, this is fact and you can look back on any major announcement by any major company and see the reactions for yourself.<br />
<br />
The only &quot;attack&quot; I made at all was calling an argument a strawman (which it is) and implying it (not the people using it, but the argument itself) lacks a brain. Which, newsflash, is kind of part of the implication behind calling an attack a strawman.<br />
<br />
To be perfectly honest, you're the one who sounds triggered here. &quot;Oh no, someone made an argument counter to mine and expanded upon it, I must immediately shut them down by attacking them!&quot;. Instead of simply calling me a Blizzard Apologist - which I am not, but in this case, I honestly see nothing wrong with what they are doing, how about you tell me how Facebook Connect will actually, 100% affect me and my enjoyment of World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and the rest of their products? Those are arguments I would genuinely be interested in, since you may see a flaw in Blizzard's plan that I have overlooked.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azgraal</div><div class="date">2016-06-06, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it hilarious that some people are genuinely upset and offended by that decision.<br />
<br />
I'll explain my reasoning, if you'll allow me. I won't deny that I find the whole gender fluid notion one of the most idiotic cries for attention ever. Being hetero or gay is one thing, completely ok with that, your sexuality doesn't define you as a person, you're just a man or a woman in either case. But a pansexual gendervoid foxkin 3/4 poliamorous hotpocket assexual being is a fad, a way for tumblr society regets to polish their snowflakeness.<br />
<br />
That being said, a) there were already mods that did exactly what EA did now so it was an unnecessary waste of time, people who choose to play that way could do so for ages already, and b) the game is an empty shell of what it used to be, it certainly looks better and sharper but the game quality and game mechanics have all been axed, and instead of a regular a good base game with some thematic and large expansions at a nice price we get a stripped base game with functionalities being repackaged and thrown into expansions that not only have the same price of the original game, they add almost nothing to the game apart from the one or two gimmicks a title. Plus the DLC object packs that used to be included in the expansion, which don't cost pennies either.<br />
<br />
That's my issue with these fashionable pandering to tumblr warriors. They are too blind and deaf to make something about the long gone quality of their games but continue to price them as premium full product games while doing some PR move to say they're &quot;oh so supportive and hip&quot;.<br />
<br />
For those of you who aren't up to date with the Sims 4's state of affairs, think WoW and what WoD was to it, with people asking for higher quality content and instead we get selfies, tweeter and facebook integration.<br />
<br />
EDIT: For those who so righteously were so quickly to quote me and became dangerously close to say &gt;it's the current year, do you want this to be the next step for WoW?<br />

<br />
Triggered? No. Merely curious. You speak of Blizzard hiring plenty of people, some of them are most likely lawyers. Why would you do their job for free?<br />
<br />
Also, I like how you would only have issues with a decision, if it would be explained 100% how it would work and how it would affect (negatively) your time. Which is, in fact, impossible - as not even features that are in place are not 100% explained, not even by Blizzard. <br />
<br />
My stance is pretty simple. Twitch wouldn't give them cheap publicity. Facebook would. So they went for the (Up for debate, sure, but still, going from that very few people actually heard about Facebook Live Streaming, on can only assume it's..) the weaker\smaller streaming service. <br />
And they didn't do it for their customers. These would stand to gain with easier tools of accessibility towards Twitch (or if there's any other streaming platform, growing strong, available).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It IS good. It can bring new players to the game. The choice of FB streaming instead of Twitch was an odd one though, certainly motivated by funds. The problem in my point of view is that its announcement comes at a time when players are dead sick of the current expansion, waiting with our breaths held for Legion not to suck and be the final nail of WoW's coffin, and in an expansion where twitter integration was the standardbearer of a major patch. <br />
<br />
Add to that the fact that Blizzard's communication with the playersbase is far from stellar and I fully understand why this move, albeit good and useful in the long run, may leave a bad taste in a lot of mouths right now. Lot's of companies are doing this currently. It's a shame, and it's always us the costumers that suffer for it.</div></div><hr />

Facebook as a company and as a service is only growing, if anything. They're controlling more and more aspects of our lives each day, for the &quot;better&quot; and for the worse.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't care. My closest friends all know I play WoW. Anyone else who I have on facebook might know too if they pay attention, with all the &quot;likes&quot; I put on WoW related content. If this is helpful to bring along more players in the future, with the ads we'll soon see, then good to them.</div></div><hr />

But I wouldn't go the lengths of some posters here and claim that this is for the current customers' sake; Will the game possibly get an influx of new players?

How does it IMPROVE anything... at best it doesnt change anything. We don't know if it doesn't take away anything ;)<br />
Well I don't like facebook because it's not really a social medium it more a big news site with ads and constant &quot;game&quot; requests ^^ but maybe it's just my friends that suck.</div></div><hr />

Turn on Two Factor Authentication if you haven't already, for both Battle.Net and Facebook.<br />

Presumably it'll work like oAuth, so you can unlink Facebook if you think your accounts been hijacked.</div></div><hr />

COULD be good? How, because Feminist &quot;Change Tracers Butt&quot; or &quot;Ban Guns from Overwatch&quot; lunatics will get more exposure to wow and therefore will flood it with accusations of &quot;hate speech&quot;, &quot;sexism&quot;, &quot;paitriachy&quot;, &quot;misogyny&quot; and so on? Or because little billy the CoD Fan will get an Ad for WoW?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainyan</div><div class="date">2016-06-06, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Triggered? No. Merely curious. You speak of Blizzard hiring plenty of people, some of them are most likely lawyers. Why would you do their job for free?<br />
<br />
I find it interesting that you feel that because I actually like something that Blizzard is doing and choose to show my support, I'm either bandwagoning (which, to be fair, would mean I jump on the most popular public opinion, which at this point is to dislike these changes), a Blizzard apologist (because I agree with them on this move?), or, apparently now some kind of shill. Are we only allowed to express an opinion on something if that opinion is negative, now?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I like how you would only have issues with a decision, if it would be explained 100% how it would work and how it would affect (negatively) your time. Which is, in fact, impossible - as not even features that are in place are not 100% explained, not even by Blizzard. <br />
<br />
My stance is pretty simple. Twitch wouldn't give them cheap publicity. Facebook would. So they went for the (Up for debate, sure, but still, going from that very few people actually heard about Facebook Live Streaming, on can only assume it's..) the weaker\smaller streaming service. <br />
And they didn't do it for their customers. These would stand to gain with easier tools of accessibility towards Twitch (or if there's any other streaming platform, growing strong, available).<br />
<br />
A negative effect is an effect which takes away, limits, or otherwise impedes the use of a service. FB connect integration does not do this. It literally only adds something to the Warcraft experience - the ability to connect and stream from Blizzard game clients to Facebook. It does not take away the ability to stream to Twitch. It does not take away your right not to use Facebook. It does not require the use of a third-party platform in order to use the game. It literally only adds a new, easily ignored functionality to Blizzard games. I asked you to provide me with information how this move negatively affects me. What does it remove from my current WoW experience? Again - you may have seen something I missed.<br />
<br />
I am truly interested in what kind of negative effect this decision will have on players - on what it takes away from the experience and the game. So please, tell me. However, if you persist in attacking me directly, I'm afraid this will be the last time I weigh in on this conversation. I have laid down facts. You have not seen fit to offer yours. And while your opinions on why Blizzard chose to do this are perfectly valid (although given how many live streams pop up in my FB feed every day, I would say that although smaller, FB streaming is not particularly weaker, that is absolutely opinion on my part), they still don't explain the negative impact of this decision on me or anyone else. So I repeat, where is the negative effect?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard acquired Major League Gaming('s assets) (http://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-blizzard-to-buy-major-league-gaming-1451947923) in January. Seems they've been working to become a Twitch competitor.<br />
<br />
Facebook has reach for TONS of normal people that don't play video games. Never will play video games and are too old to care. Twitch is ABOUT video games, You gotta learn that certain types of reach are better than broad one. Also, MLG isn't as much a streaming platform as it is a competition one, Team sponsorships, tournaments and investors. They would be suicidal to go against Twitch. Plus they would have already announced a streaming services if that was their plan.</div></div><hr />

Video game companies, especially ones that make F2P microtransaction based games, love the data that Facebook logins feed them. I wonder when it'll be mandatory.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess Facebook is paying them a lot of money. Twitch has a streaming API too and is clearly the more gaming focused streaming platform.<br />
It's probably not so much the money so much as it's the data and eyeball reach they can get through Facebook that they pretty much can't get from anyone else. A Twitch login doesn't come with the amount of social connections, purchasing, and browsing tracking that a Facebook login does. Facebook also forces real names and real identifying information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because this question keeps coming up I'm deviating from my standard single response to a topic.<br />
<br />
To make this as simple as possible:<br />
<br />
- facebook needs more data to sell to advertisers, to make more money<br />
- there is a limit to how many new users facebook can ensnare through peer pressure/referrals<br />
- facebook sees gaps in it's data 'what are people doing when they aren't working/sleeping/on facebook?'<br />
- facebook pays off a company with a large enough userbase of people that engage in something that takes time<br />
- facebook gets more data to sell to advertisers<br />
<br />
Again this is a really simple breakdown, but just keep in mind facebook's never ending goal is creating ever more accurate data on what you do within the day, so they can sell that increasingly accurate information to advertisers, who want to send you increasingly personal and targeted advertising. Every move facebook makes is to get more or better data to sell to advertisers. As far as business goes it's a win-win, Blizzard get money, facebook get more of your information, the loser is the consumer and their eroding privacy.</div></div><hr />

Also, as long as this was worked on by a new team that wasn't currently working on anything else in WoW and other Blizzard games I am fine with it. I won't use it, since I use Twitch for streaming.. but still not bad.<br />
<br />
If someone got pulled from a project that would have added other content into WoW, SC, Diablo, etc.... then this is bad.<br />
<br />
If it takes resources away from other things it affects everyone.<br />
Like the twitter integration I have no plans on using Facebook either.<br />
That being said WoW is on the down side of the hill and, seemingly, will never be the king it used to be -- they have to justify that expanded team *somehow* considering HFC is (roughly) on par with SoO and they obviously didn't &quot;learn&quot; anything from the &gt;1 year patch cycle.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes it's like you want to give bitter people ammunition to use against your priorities.</div></div><hr />

Then again what about this only 1/3 of you friends list see's your posts, how will this effect this....</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manypillars</div><div class="date">2016-06-06, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because this question keeps coming up I'm deviating from my standard single response to a topic.<br />
<br />
To make this as simple as possible:<br />
<br />
- facebook needs more data to sell to advertisers, to make more money<br />
- there is a limit to how many new users facebook can ensnare through peer pressure/referrals<br />
- facebook sees gaps in it's data 'what are people doing when they aren't working/sleeping/on facebook?'<br />
- facebook pays off a company with a large enough userbase of people that engage in something that takes time<br />
- facebook gets more data to sell to advertisers<br />
<br />
Again this is a really simple breakdown, but just keep in mind facebook's never ending goal is creating ever more accurate data on what you do within the day, so they can sell that increasingly accurate information to advertisers, who want to send you increasingly personal and targeted advertising. Every move facebook makes is to get more or better data to sell to advertisers. As far as business goes it's a win-win, Blizzard get money, facebook get more of your information, the loser is the consumer and their eroding privacy.<br />
<br />
The Facebook API gives their partners a window into their users as well. Don't forget what Blizzard gets out of this:<br />
-What other games are their players playing that aren't Blizzard games?<br />
-What are their hobbies outside of Blizzard games and games in general?<br />
-What are their interests, their causes?<br />
-What/who are their social connections?<br />
-What do they buy?</div></div><hr />

Can't wait to play alongside ardent Facebook gamers, bring on the World of Watered-down-craft</div></div><hr />

At this point with the sub numbers this low I'd say the &quot;beggars can't be choosers&quot; saying applies.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saracens</div><div class="date">2016-06-06, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This really seems like a step in the wrong direction for account security, and a step in the right direction for streaming. I'm conflicted, but I feel like the cons outweigh the pros here.</div></div><hr />

My first thought!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tehdef</div><div class="date">2016-06-06, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A already feel it when pissing: Legion will be my last xpac.. gonna invest that 50 bucks for a last time.. stay subbed for a few months. Level up 110. do all Dungeons 30 times, have full 15-20 evenings of raiding, get into PVP a bit more if it doesnt suck to much after the pruning, get the flying achievement, explore the world.. unsub and uninstall.<br />
<br />
What does this have to do with Facebook? Nothing here you said has ANYTHING to do with Facebook. Like, at all? It all has to do with content within the game.<br />
<br />
Just try to have fun. Once you stop having fun, stop playing.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is aiming at younger generation of gamers. Its just how world works i guess. Soon you will be able to play in the browser and on mobile.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is, the younger generation considers Facebook an old person's &quot;thing&quot;. Know anyone less than 15 years of age? If so, chat with them. Facebook isn't &quot;cool&quot; anymore.</div></div><hr />
