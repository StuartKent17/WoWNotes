<br />
Patch 6.2 Hotfixes - August 3<br />
Garrisons<br />
Naval Missions<br />
<br />
An Expert Captain threat can now be fully countered by 2 Pandaren Crews or 2 assist ship equipment (Ammo Reserves, Automated Sky Scanner, Extra Quarters, Noisemaker Mines, and Sonic Amplification Field).<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
Legendary Ring Quest Line<br />
<br />
[Hotfix in testing] Master vs. Commander: Fixed an issue that could cause legendary naval missions needed to obtain a Draenic Sea Chart to not show up correctly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
Hellfire Citadel<br />
General<br />
<br />
Corrected an issue where bonus roll loot tables for Tyrant Velhari and Fel Lord Zakuun's got swapped on Raid Finder difficulty.<br />
<br />
Kilrogg Deadeye<br />
<br />
Health of adds for the encounter have been reduced by roughly 20% for raid groups with 10 players on Normal and Heroic difficulty. This should help with the difficulty experienced by smaller raid groups losing their DPS when sending players down into the death phase. The health of adds scales back up and should be remain roughly unchanged from before as raid group size increases.<br />
<br />
Gorefiend<br />
<br />
Players who die to Digest or from fatal damage while in the stomach phase in the Gorefiend encounter should now be able to be resurrected once their bodies are teleported back outside.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Ashran<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue that could incorrectly cause player pet health to increase while in the center lane in Ashran.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Reduced the chance to obtain bonus Felblight (http://www.wowdb.com/items/127759-felblight).<br />
<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
<br />
Naval Siege Specialist (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10161-naval-siege-specialist): Fixed an issue where certain naval siege missions wasn't granting credit towards the achievement.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />

Armor Sets<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Character / Items<br />
is there any plan to fix player inventory? Bank &amp; VS = full. Can't quest anymore cause no where to put rewards.It's game breaking<br />
Parden my ignorance, but what all are you keeping? I usually do a purge once per expac of old stuff. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/625221479249018880))<br />
10 years of tier sets &amp; holiday rewards pvp gear. X mog weapons. Why would I purge stuff Ive invested countless hours acquiring?<br />
Sounds like a lot of wearable items! Hopefully we can address this soon. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/625243418583695360))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Riot wouldn't exist if it wasn't for Blizzard. The only reason is a game is because of Warcraft III customs.<br />
True story. And the War3 editor was based on the Starcraft editor. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/619658521223626752))<br />

Insight into the mind of a game developer. And one who used to work on WoW. People complain about the lack of transparency. And now they complain about too much transparency. There's no pleasing some people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. We don't have automated tracking of CM tweets, as they are almost always not newsworthy. He is also not a game designer and not talking about WoW. This is likely the last time we will cover him unless something interesting appears.</div></div><hr />

He went from Community Manager to Senior Content Manager. Most likely a salary bump, more responsibilities and new challenges. And he won't have to deal with miserable fucks every day of the week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sort of agree, it's just that there are 7 other dungeons you can run instead of everbloom and not have to worry about that at all. And as far as I know, there is no reason to want to specifically run everbloom.<br />
<br />
I loved the exploit just because of how painful it is trying to run 4 full mythic dungeons on my main and all of the alts. If it were a weekly thing instead of a weekend thing it would be easier to complete.</div></div><hr />

how is that cheat/exploit/break the game exactly? The path to skip all thrash mobs existed since the beginning of the expansion, Everbloom is one big playground for players to jump around and ignore trashmobs. All the good CM times in that instance have been done by using those exact &quot;exploits&quot; and blizzard decides all of a sudden to give a fuck because a damn casual got butthurt over &quot;exploiting&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Actually they already fixed some of them before now. There was a hoo hah about having the leaderboards reset because it was no longer possible to come close to some of the top times. Clearly they've decided that they don't want people skipping the /entirety/ of the dungeon. <br />
<br />
Clearly the guy who was playing actually wanted loot from the bosses prior to the last boss. But fuck that guy, he should only be here after he doesn't need loot from here. Cos y'know, dungeons are only for teh hardcorez and &quot;casuals&quot; have no place there. What, you just got your silver proving grounds done? Because that's the only reason I can think of that you would bring in the casual argument when we're discussing heroic fucking dungeons.<br />
<br />
Besides, this is different, in CM, you need to kill so much trash and all the bosses anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unsure if you've ever seen the amount of trash you need to pull for the CM. Also that dungeon and all those unneeded trash mobs simply feels like it was intended that you skip 3/4 of it every time you do it.<br />
I didn't mention any proving ground, you mentioning it is pretty irrelevant.<br />
<br />
My whole point is that the path is there, blizzard knew about it and that the last boss was accessible via that way. My whole point is, when a group leader makes a group and states &quot;farming everbloom last boss x4 for quest&quot; he clearly states the purpose of the group. My whole point is, you can simply press the big shiny &quot;Make a group&quot; button yourself and type in the title &quot;Everbloom going all bosses, no skips&quot;. My whole point is that even if you farm last boss x4 for the quest you don't get loot locked so you could actually return there after and finish it. My whole point is that it's damn infuriating when Blizzard rushes in the &quot;save&quot; the (casual, apparently, for reasons stated above) damsel in distress by making a hotfix as stupid as that when in reality they could bother with much more important things.</div></div><hr />

Your whole point is &quot;I enjoy exploiting the game, therefore anyone who disagrees with is an idiot because I'm right and you're wrong LALALALA.&quot;<br />
<br />
There is no legitimate reason to have an exploit left in the game. The only things Blizzard did wrong were to not playtest sufficiently to find the exploit before the game went live, and to leave it intact for as long as they did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some guildies and I still needed to start the 4 mythic clears at 9.15 pm (event closing at 11.01pm), and we went in, noticed the fix. Went to Auchindon and did some heroic chain pulling. Made the last one at 10.58pm! Even though the fix sucked, it has indirectly caused more fun for us. Can imagine this must have sucked if you needed to pug the last one on a low ilvl character at 9.30 pm though.</div></div><hr />

I played Aion when it launched, stopped soon after. Downloaded it recently and got it up and running just because.<br />
<br />
Still a beautiful game. Still confusing as shit to actually play beyond early lvling. So sad, alot of NCSOFT published mmos have potential. Maybe he can make a difference there, probably can't hurt them at this point really.</div></div><hr />

Wow, that was challenging, wasn't it?<br />
<br />
Are you kidding? As far as I am aware, group finder is meant to find a group to do an instance, not specific activities. It should be the other way around: want to skip whole instance? Make a custom group. The same way people make custom groups to do leeroy, not 'ubrs hc - not doing leeroy'<br />

The path to skip all thrash mobs existed since the beginning of the expansion, Everbloom is one big playground for players to jump around and ignore trashmobs. All the good CM times in that instance have been done by using those exact &quot;exploits&quot; and blizzard decides all of a sudden to give a fuck because a damn casual got butthurt over &quot;exploiting&quot;?<br />

Let me break it down for you Barnie style:<br />

I agree entirely. I don't really care if you want to be cheap and skip everything, but skipping should be seen as the non-standard approach, and should be made via the custom group finder. Same with achievements.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is not the holy graal of developers. He worked there so several years and probably just got tired of it and wanted to work in a new environment.</div></div><hr />

I will never trust anyone named Muffinus. I generally dump the rings and necklaces and trinkets. But but each tier you are looking at about 6 pieces of armor then a weapon/offhand. No to mention the different colors for level of raid. Then throw in dungeon gear.</div></div><hr />

Actually, their GW2 sales have been quite steady and have even grown a bit lately. After the expansion announcement and their weekend sale, the number of new players in the starting area increased so much it wasn't funny. Had a bunch of people discuss the game, help players out and invite them to guilds (and a lot of them still play actively in said guilds).<br />
<br />
GW2, for a game of its size, is doing perfectly fine. If an expansion announcement triggers a small surge of new players like that, I'd like to see what an expansion release does.</div></div><hr />

GW2 is doing fine, and if NCSoft would stop preventing their Korean games from coming to NA NCSoft would be a big publisher here. You can think Blizzard releasing failed f2p games and failed rts/rpg games is better but I have a feeling Bashiok did his research.</div></div><hr />

GW2 has always done well and is actually picking up steam thanks to the soon to come expansion. In fact, GW2 is the MMO I recommend for new players and veterans burning out on the same old bullshit these other games force you to pay monthly for.<br />
<br />
After Wildstar goes F2P that has a good chance of picking up as well.</div></div><hr />

I'm really not surprised they're dragging their feet on it - some of the devs are probably adamant that everyone experience the expansion how they think you should, before begrudgingly allowing you to fly.<br />
<br />
I don't have the PTR client installed, but i can't imagine there's any technical issues holding it up, unless they're reworking all the jumping puzzles so flying can't negate them, or something dumb like that.<br />

I don't personally care that flying isn't in yet, but even if they were to put flying in today, people would still be required to &quot;experience the expansion how they think you should&quot; as you call it. You have to earn the Pathfinder achievement in order to be able to fly, and that's essentially doing everything that takes place outdoors in the expansion.</div></div><hr />

I agree!! Lol I hope he got trolled relentlessly on Twitter. I get it, some people don't want to do all that but too bad for them. I know I personally benefited from it on several alts who wouldn't have been able to get it done otherwise because people think you need 700+ ilvl for 685 content and they don't have the item level. However, because they were able to slip by, they all got some really nice (in some cases, top slot) pieces.

Well, me and a friend left for Final Fantasy XIV (good game, btw) in mid June. However, our tokens expired a few days into July, so we may still be counted as subscribers, I'd guess. I'm sad to have left WoW after 10 years (and tons of max level chars on horde/ally). However, as a non raider (I don't count LFR as raiding), WoD was a great disappointment to me and I haven't once missed it since moving on to FFXIV.<br />
<br />
Ah well, I hope they get their non-raid mojo back with the next expansion, but at this point, I'm pretty sure I won't come back to WoW due to how happy I am with FFXIV.</div></div><hr />
