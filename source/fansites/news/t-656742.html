<br />
While i agree on the shaman part, which looks like something they shoved out their... erm, you know, you think rogue looks bad ass? Rogue sets haven't looked nice since T6, as T7 is just a copy/paste/recolor thing, and the T8 head looks like umm... i won't even start going there.<br />
<br />
Seems like more and more blizz pulls out the most lame and idiotic art work regarding gear.<br />
In the 4 years since i've been playing it's only been going down the drain pipe :(<br />

The helmet especially, just o_O weird. Snake like. What do shamans have with snakes?<br />
<br />
The rogue set is &quot;nice&quot; but the colors are just plain wrong.<br />
They should really exchange the white for black, and it'd be perrrfect.<br />
<br />
Warlock set is sexy, but looks like plate rather than cloth.<br />
<br />
Hunter set seems rather plain compared to some of the others.</div></div><hr />

They need a snake helmet for that though?<br />
<br />
And they do have frost shock.. but shamans are primarily known for lightning.<br />

<br />
As for the shamans, it seems to look best on the females, and I can tell you why that's the case. The shoulders are reduced and the red &quot;silky&quot; material looks more like a feminine material. Of course the female Draenei looks the best due to her figure and that model usually has the smallest shoulders.<br />
<br />
The Mage pvp gear has had a thing for looking really REALLY bland since S4. Not as bad as S3, but WotlK overall has had very forgettable looking sets for mages when it comes to pvp gear. As bad as S3 was, we had S1 (Ok), S2 (the fav looking set for many mages), and S4, my personal favorite.</div></div><hr />

Well, there's always some that won't be pleased with their set when a new tier is released.<br />
It's the generally accepted norm.<br />

<br />
@MMO-C staff, is it possible the rogue set could be recoloured to dark/blue colours? I understand that the set is possibly bugged/incomplete at this point but the helm doesnt really match the shoulder colours at all and it might make more sense for it to be darker coloured than a cross between rogue s6/mage s6.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think you realize that Blizz already stated that they were going to work on the first pvp gear, then evolve from that using the same structure.<br />
<br />
They look good, rather know your last set was good and your next will be good, instead of them making a new armor model and looking like shit.</div></div><hr />

I'll tell you how I would fix it , an easy fix before it comes out.<br />
all the red parts make them black, and all the glacial/frost parts make them look like lava.... with lighting flashes every 10 sec on the helm (not the shoulders, but the helm, for a change)<br />

This might, might save that design , because this is NOT SO SHAMANISTIC.</div></div><hr />

Rogue sets haven't looked nice since T6, as T7 is just a copy/paste/recolor thing, and the T8 head looks like umm... i won't even start going there.<br />
<br />
Seems like more and more blizz pulls out the most lame and idiotic art work regarding gear.<br />
In the 4 years since i've been playing it's only been going down the drain pipe :(<br />
Sigh..<br />
<br />
<br />
So what you're saying is that we had ONE set that was bad? T7 looked great, even though it was a recolored T3. Personally (and I know I'm not the only one) I think T8 is awesome too. The helm might not be the coolest, but it's definitely original, which I appreciate. Plus - the shoulders kick ass. T9 however, sucks...but that's fine with me, I've liked pretty much every rogue set so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was originally going to critique them all really harshly then I looked at each set again and realized all have good qualities and bad. <br />
<br />
I love the Shammy set on the fem orc, troll and dran, the gold and black on the helmets are my fav part. I'm not a big fan of the scale design on it tho.<br />
<br />
Pallys i originally hated then i realized if it didn't have those shoulders or gems it would look pretty sweet. <br />
<br />
Rogues shoulders and the gem in the head should be removed as well(the shoulders don't even match the color scheme or style of the rest of the set)<br />
<br />
Please stop giving wars that stupid neck type helmet How does plate help when all someone needs to do is hit you on the head once with a staff and your dead? If they gave it a diff helm i would say it would be one of the best sets.<br />
<br />
My only prob with the hunter set is the helms gem should be red like the rest of the armor and the front of the helm should be black to match the rest of the gear.<br />
<br />
If they did these changes i think all the sets would look great.</div></div><hr />

They're making the armor mirror the state of arena through looks. Like s1 armor looked laughable, and thats basically what playing arenas was like. s2 looked like crap, and thus playing arenas felt like crap. Now the armor has officially been upgraded to lame, and so we can expect arenas to be lame. Very clever, although i still wish arenas were awesome with awesome armor like every season in BC, but blizz cba to do that apparently.</div></div><hr />

After seeing the warrior shoulders anything is small compared to that yea:) <br />

If it were dark blue and red it might look more shammyish.<br />

Even still, pretty lame set overall. If this is gonna be the shammyset then you'd think they'd give us more than one ice spell? I typically think of light blue shards = ice, but we use water spells (not ice spells) and/or lightning spells/fire spells more. <br />

Fucking nitpickers, can't understand the difference from seeing it on a stilled image and seeing it in-game.<br />
<br />
People have been complaining about gear looking like shit (always in there opinion) ever since vanilla WoW. Face it, they'll never care what you say, so you people complaining will not change a fucking thing.<br />
<br />
Geez, quit acting like fucking children and appreciate what they give you. It's either new stuff to work for or just shut down the game completely (I'd choose the latter, just to piss you people off).<br />

the only tiny change i would make would be to extend the neck guard so it wrapped around the back of the helmet. (also would prefer that this was t9)<br />

sham would be nice if the pants were swapped for a kilt and the top of the helmet was altered.<br />

Rogue set is furious except for the shoulders which are complete and look OK and the helm which seems to be the deadly mask and some strange buggy hood, idk whats with that but the set is far from complete in its current form :D</div></div><hr />

The Season 7 Models were also updated in the latest PTR builds and it's time for an update. Keep in mind that this is from the test servers, some models aren't finished yet. (Mage shoulders are bugged, the color of the hunter's helm seems to be the old one, the female priest breastplate seems bugged, etc ...)<br />

<br />
<br />
it's hilariously bad armor, but it always was. <br />
<br />
admittedly the warlocks got pretty much dreadweave + garden lights stuck on the shoulders, it looks fairly OK. <br />
the floating circlet on the mage helm looks pretty sweet, but it's probably a glitch, and so i'll ignore it. <br />
<br />
the question is, who the hell is going to collect 40 billion honor points to look like this. <br />
<br />
the DK armor looks like the tron guy who made up his own costume, complete with chin strap and blue highlights. and kaiser helm spike to boot.</div></div><hr />
