Demon Hunters can no longer go beyond the expected boundaries of the Temple of Kotmogu battleground.<br />

<br />
Lunar Strike (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/194153-lunar-strike) splash damage increased to 35% of initial damage (was 18%).<br />
Mastery: Nature's Guardian (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/159195-mastery-natures-guardian) once again gives 1% Attack Power per point, as intended.<br />
Nature's Guardian doesn't increase healing from Hand of the Protector, Ysera's Gift (self), Cleansing Waters, or Judgments of the Pure.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: Heals that scale with the Guardian's maximum health already benefit from Mastery, so further increasing their healing was &quot;double-dipping&quot; Mastery.<br />

Murder of Crows (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/131894-a-murder-of-crows) (Marksmanship) now deals damage equal to 162% of Attack Power (was 135%).<br />

<br />
Penance (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/47750-penance) damage is now 190% of Spell Power (was 175%).<br />
The Penitent (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/200347-the-penitent) now heals 300% of Spell Power (was 275%).<br />

Purge the Wicked (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/204197-purge-the-wicked) additional damage increased to 48% of Spell Power (was 42%).<br />
Dominant Mind (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205367-dominant-mind) cooldown reduced to 2 minutes (was 3 minutes).<br />
Schism (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/214621-schism) now deals damage equal to 425% of Spell Power (was 400%).<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: We recently identified a bug that was causing Discipline Priests to gain far more benefit than intended from caster DPS trinkets. While we do intend for Discipline to benefit from caster DPS trinkets (including through Atonement), and will be tuning those appropriately, we are slightly increasing the spec’s damage to account for the bug fix. We will continue monitoring the issue.<br />

Elaborate Planning (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/193640-elaborate-planning) now makes your finishing move grant a 15% bonus to damage (was 12%).<br />

<br />
Unleash Life (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/73685-unleash-life) increases your next heal by 45% (was 30%).<br />
Wellspring (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/197995-wellspring) now heals for 375% of Spell Power (was 300%).<br />
Wellspring heals for 25% of normal value on full-health targets, if it has more than 6 targets.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: This does not reduce Wellspring's effective (non-overheal) healing. In the future we plan to find a different solution, but we felt it was it was better to address the interaction between Wellspring overhealing and Cloudburst Totem now, rather than wait to change it after it got more use. <br />

<br />
(Havoc) PvP Stat Assignment Adjustments:<br />
<br />
Agility reduced by 10%<br />
Mastery reduced by 60%<br />
Critical Strike increased by 30%<br />
Haste increased by 30%<br />
<br />
Developers’ note: Havoc Demon Hunter damage overall was quite high, so we reduced the amount of Agility they receive in PvP. We also felt that their Mastery contributed too much to excessive burst, so we’ve redistributed their secondary stat budget, reducing their Mastery, but increasing their Critical Strike and Haste.<br />
<br />

<br />
They consist entirely of nerfs with the exception of buffing fire mage which is already doing very well and bursting shot for hunters. Yet so far with sims and LFR input there is no reason for this? Is blizzard standing on their &quot;Ranged = Raid&quot; &quot;Melee = Mythic+&quot; ?<br />

It's the same Class we've seen for over 10 years now which will be broken.<br />
Thanks again Blizzard for listening. :confused:<br />

I really don't understand why some people argue that there's still time to fix a problem, meanwhile Blizzard is actively causing more problems don't you understand how that just makes you look like a huge tool?<br />
<br />
Yes there's still time to fix the gap in melee and ranged mythic viability has blizzard taken any steps towards that in the past months until now? No it affects such a small portion of the game its not remotely on the table. As melee we just have to accept the fact that there will always be 10 ranged and 4 melee in every mythic raid and cry a little while making our own Mythic+ groups from the bench.<br />
<br />
Edit: Honestly 4 melee is being overly generous most will take 3 melee in the first couple weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In all seriousness though, why do they keep getting buffs. It is a little confusing. Especially when you look at the classes getting nerfs, I didn't think the gap was major enough at this point to keep this up. Thankfully it is mostly the legendary items, but I don't feel Mages need another 100% damage buff to that legendary. <br />
<br />
Oh, well we'll see. But this has been an odd run. Even for pre-patch. Hopefully other classes will &quot;scale better with gear&quot; than mages. But I won't hold my breath on that.<br />

Mages always scale well, esp Fire,crit cap isnt until 80% crit, so stack crit,crit,crit, join us, the dark side #fire<br />

Affliction locks actually needed a buff in pve, and I'd hardly even call that a buff. Sorry your class got nerfed, but don't take it out on one of the worst caster spec atm</div></div><hr />

As such, we have to be good at it, which we have been, basicly since wow came out. <br />
Fix the rest instead of talking about how OP fire is - fire is really well built in it's current state and only gonna be more fun with artifact and legendaries. <br />
I wish the devs could do the same for the rest of classes/specs, so that competition between classes and specs, depended solely on individual skills, rather than playing the right class/spec! :(</div></div><hr />

There is no bad specs/classes. We used any specs in our raid (bring the player, not the class, right?) -- like two elemental shamans, feral cat or fire mage and cleared in first days of february.</div></div><hr />

Well people probably have noticed, its not like the legendary is new, its same with shaman one and the One Piece Reference. People aren't gonna shout out the reference every time something about it brought up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Explain please.<br />

you must be new around here, this is how it has always been, europe gets the expansion earlier than US because of the time zone difference, yet for some reason always get the maintenance earlier therefore get patch content earlier than europe.</div></div><hr />

- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
Mage has always been strong, one of the three specs is always raid viable/strong, people that play classes like Feral/Ret/SP, things like that and bitch every xpac about their low numbers, why play it lol? Mages always scale well, esp Fire,crit cap isnt until 80% crit, so stack crit,crit,crit, join us, the dark side #fire<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
This is why you gear alts when Mythic is on farm,so you have the strongest/best class ready for the xpac, instead of playing an inferior bad spec that is almost a waste for a raid/guild to gear.<br />
<br />
I'd like to punch elitist retards like you in the face. &quot;We don't need balance! Certain classes being obviously stronger than their counterparts is totally fine! If you don't play those OP classes, you're stupid&quot;. Yeah, I guess the game would be ultra lovely if everyone would play OP classes, so you'd see 3 classes (the strongest in the given roles) ONLY being played in the game. Best experience ever!<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: I realized I &quot;missed&quot; the part where Apocalypse will get nerfed only in PVP so that part of my comment is irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

Dumb enough to vote for something you don't know huh ?<br />
There is no Flag of European Union dumbass, this is EUROPE FLAG.<br />

<br />
Okay, but your country isn't &quot;yet&quot; the center of the universe so they can't use his flag. Sorry for narcissic people out there. You take the Europe AS A WHOLE (Union or not) FLAG for European Union Flag only which is not.<br />
The best to represent Europe is indeed the Europe Flag. Obvisouly, they can't picture the whole countries flag in one shot... If you're a country amongst Europe (continent), you are most represented with this flag as a whole and if you hate it, just leave the continent. If you're not Europe (continent), well you don't care so do we.</div></div><hr />
