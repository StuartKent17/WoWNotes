Warlords of Draenor - Grimrail Depot<br />
Today we are taking a look at Grimrail Depot, one of the new dungeons in Warlords of Draenor. If you are a fan of trains this is just the dungeon for you!<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Weekly Story Quests<br />
It looks like there will be even more reasons to log in frequently in Warlords of Draenor, as there will be weekly story quests!<br />
Finally met up with Azuka Bladefury, a female Warlord, in Nagrand<br />
You'll be seeing much more of her during level 100 weekly story quests. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/493222703059709952))<br />
Weekly short stories that tap into our many level 100 spaces. Many different subjects, but Azuka plays a big role. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/493224924228894720))<br />
Do we learn about various lore each week? Are they random or a scheduled order?<br />
Semi-scheduled intro, midpoint, and finale with randomness in between. A mix of local stories and big character stories. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/493249994401792000))<br />
Is it possible to 'miss' these quests? Say, by not being able to play on a given week? Possible to do them again later?<br />
You can't miss them. If you skip a week and it rerolls something else, you'll still get it again later. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/493279889081253888))<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Black Market Auction House<br />
The Black Market Auction House has moved from Pandaria to the Ring of Blood in Nagrand for Warlords of Draenor. <br />
<br />
Kalidiar has noted (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1560421-BMAH-new-items-in-6-0) some interesting new items for sale, such as Tabard of the Arcane (http://www.wowdb.com/items/38310-tabard-of-the-arcane), Grimoire of the Four Winds (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/110672-grimoire-of-the-four-winds), Swift Razzashi Raptor (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/19872-swift-razzashi-raptor), and more.<br />

Classes<br />
New major glyphs coming for defensive dispels in #Warlords. 2 charges but increases cooldown by 4 seconds. Courtesy of &amp; co. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/490531621460652032))<br />
Bad idea if reducing cc. Also, can you stop adding glyphs like this. Priests have more mandatory glyphs than we can use<br />
we'd be pretty happy if everyone had more than three &quot;mandatory&quot; glyphs (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/490744270416932864))<br />
<br />
Do you ever think you went too far with ability pruning?<br />
Not sure. Playing some classes on beta, I really love the extra action bar space and streamlined nature of the classes. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/490976428922798080))<br />
<br />
Melee uptime seems really high. Dmg is high from some melee but I assume you have a series of numbers passes to do. Good stuff.<br />
there is tuning but have heard a lot of concerns about melee mobility...but I don't think it's all melee. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/490976586246520832))<br />
<br />
Any mobility changes planned for next build?<br />
We probably need to start getting more specific than &quot;mobility&quot; at this point. Some melee are great here, others are not. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/490977650945454081))<br />
<br />
On live I can go 10 min with almost no empty gcd. On beta I already had more empty gcd in less than 2 min testing.<br />
There's quite a few tiers of difference involved there. That's normal. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/490993893228285952))<br />

Purpose of &quot;Enhanced Will of the Necropolis&quot;? Are dk tanks designed to drop below 30% every 30 secs?<br />
&quot;Designed to&quot;, no. Able to benefit from Will of the Necropolis that often, yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/490928873786204162))<br />

maybe when the ww numbers start to drop you guys will agree. Blizzard sold us a &quot;fast pacing street fighter style&quot;.<br />
.Threats like that have long lost their sway over us. It's still a fast-based combat spec. People are are spreading this idea... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/490954213178888193))<br />
...that Windwalkers are some slow spec now that is energy starved. That's not at all the case. It's simply not. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/490954428971614208))<br />

Attack speed from Empowered seals doesn't have any effect on Crusader Strike cooldown in beta. Intended?<br />
Yes; attack speed is not haste. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/490303477822652417))<br />
It isn't worth to seal-dance then, is it? Thank you for your answer.<br />
It should still be. Tuning may be off. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/490304527665352704))<br />
<br />
1) Can you give me a PvE scenario where Seraphim &gt; FV/EmpS? I really don't see it beating them even after...<br />
You find the pooling/burst gameplay fun, you want bursts semi-frequent of damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/490345138720227328))<br />
Even if you could call it fun(you can't), damage(which it lacks) trumps fun on and serious progression<br />
Tuning hasn't happened yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/490585112828846080))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
the basilisks, warpstalkers and tallstriders of draenor will have new model? please they need one, thanks<br />
We tried to update as many iconic creatures as possible, sadly we could not get them all. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/490569630478774272))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
you mentioned a &quot;cool new feature&quot; you hadn't shared yet...still coming, or did I miss something?<br />
Still coming...but there have been hints out there. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/490378332148494336))<br />
<br />
I've been around since Day one - I would love to see stats that show me I'm wrong and PvP is not a niche<br />
In the US and EU, the number of people doing random battlegrounds is as high or more than LFR. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/490374507563986945))<br />
likewise as many people do 2s as normal raiding. As many do 3s as heroic raiding. Not a niche. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/490374881045794817))<br />
and the number of people doing 5's is the same as those doing CM's?<br />
Yeah very few people do 5s and we don't think it is very good gameplay either (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/490399551056908288))<br />
Does that number filter out people doing only the legendary quest?<br />
This was the trend before the legendary quest (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/490519925081899009))<br />
<br />
(wod) why are incaps and disorients seperate DRs? promotes caster cleaves with moonkin or wl. if combined: melee+ranged best comps<br />
A lot of history with those DR categories. Not prepared to make that seismic of a shift. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/490376522125934593))<br />
reading from your comment that i'm right essentially, but the change would be too much for now. right?<br />
No not really. The game has been working pretty well with those DR categories. Don't feel such a disruptive change is needed. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/490495421324599296))<br />
<br />
so basically Ashran is a AoE fest with PvE mobs thrown into the mix for fun?<br />
It's important to note that we're trying to offer a new type of experience with Ashran including the &quot;giant zerg&quot; feel (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/490550803069816832))<br />
it isn't for everyone but some people REALLY like it. Variety is the spice of life...in WoW (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/490550977917755392))<br />
Also regarding the zerg, spell clutter culling will be coming soon, and that'll help with the visual soup. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/490552335169384448))<br />
<br />
Are the Vicious Saddle mounts going to be obtainable in WoD as well, or will they get replaced by new mounts?<br />
still obtainable (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/490813030490324994))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Reading the Talador preview. Is the Kirin Tor neutral again in WoD?<br />
Khadgar is. He wants to get the politics out of the Kirin-Tor. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/490315799869939713))<br />
Can't you just make him a alliance hero that is willing to work with the Horde for the greater good.<br />
That's exactly what he is. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/490340419436167168))<br />
<br />
Will we see the ettin in Draenor (WoD)? Thanks .<br />
No ettins, but we have Ogronn, Lesser Gronn (don't think that's the real name) Gronn and Magnaron. Many giants! (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/490556392210583553))<br />
Why no Ettins? WoD is as good a time as ever to explain their existence.<br />
There is evidence that they're in the ogre/ogronn/gronn family. That's all anyone knows. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/490571312046546944))<br />
<br />
Didn't the Arakkoa try to summon an Old God to Outland so why isn't he showing up????<br />
The Dark Conclave doesn't exist yet. Most arakkoa do not worship Old Gods. At least not at the time of WoD (BC -30 years). (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/490785763475595264))<br />
<br />
Who are the Scorpars? beasts o humanoids scorpions? we will see them? <br />
Creatures we ended up cutting. You won't see them in WoD. At least not at launch... (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/490964149778657281))<br />
To clarify: MAYBE NEVER. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/490964284646518784))<br />
<br />
So is Sethe who the arakkoa in Outland's SMV were trying to summon?<br />
Nope. That was Dark Conclave trying to summon an unnamed Old God. Sethe is a primal god worshipped by the Sethekk (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/490976399339974656))<br />
Is that Old God planned to show up in WoD? I.e. is he native to Draenor?<br />
No plans for him at the moment. The arakkoa may not even be in contact with him yet. We don't know. <br />
<br />
Reputation / Questing<br />
Hi!, is the ending for FFR under redesigning? We've never been able to see it/test it, while SMV has an ending with Karabor.<br />
Not being redesigned. The finale for Frostfire has an (amazing) in-game cinematic which we have not yet revealed. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/490303069804965888))<br />
<br />
World<br />
Then... Why have them next to the giant PvP zone? Why not just make it hard by distance, which Kara/BSF provides.<br />
Seeing other players is totally cool, see: Dalaran. Flying to stuff because your hub is not near anything isn't cool. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/490276824677502976))<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Ashran the island off the coast? Seems like you put the hub far from everything...<br />
Looking at fast ways to get from your garrison to Ashran hub. Keep in mind: Garrison is in SMV/FF, you see a lot of them. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/490277483791388672))<br />
So World &gt; Garrison &gt; Hub is the intended path to take this expansion?<br />
The endgame of WoD has yet to be unveiled - you'll be fighting all over, think 5.1+Timeless Isle combined (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/490278455355781120))<br />
<br />
Dave... Alex... Why is there suddenly, what appears to be, a portal to the Emerald Nightmare near Stormwind?<br />
OOOoooo mystery!! (Will make sense once all the dungeons are in.) (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/490314905208123393))<br />
<br />
are we going to have intact draenei cities outside of shadowmoon? ie shattrath a neutral hub?<br />
I believe there are some in Talador? Smaller pockets of resistance, at least. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/490570068905181184))<br />
<br />
Will The Dark Portal in Outland fade away? Thanks .<br />
Well the portal in Blasted Lands now links to Draenor (Tanaan Jungle) but as for the Hellfire portal... good question. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/490802737421242368))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Oh so will my faction Leaders randomly show up garrison? No? Ok well how about access to my bank? No? &lt;con&gt;<br />
If you've played the beta, you've seen Thrall/Durotan there. So yes, they do Storehouse gives you bank acc (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/490279610077040640))<br />
<br />
the ability to destroy our forces while being united<br />
This is why you're building a garrison, Ashran isn't half of the story of what you're ultimately building up to in future. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/490277654952554496))<br />
I still disagree with moving the capitols to Ashran but okay<br />
The capitol is really your garrison, it's where you start from, where many things intersect, and ultimately = winning vs ??? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/490278683983097857))<br />
<br />
So, do we get a target dummy at some point in those garrisons? <br />
If you take the Sparring Arena, yes! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/490562619565428736))<br />
<br />
Normal Garrison missions are 30m, I just got a rare mission with an 8 hour duration! Intended?<br />
Longer time, epic-er rewards (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/490562828852408320))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/july/ssdgraph.gif) are trending slightly downward over the past few months, with all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. <br />
<br />
The Haswell refresh is here for non-overclockable CPUs, with the overclockable versions likely coming in the next few months. These may offer somewhat better overclocking performance, which may worth waiting for if you are overclocking to the limits of air cooling.<br />
<br />
The new Haswell Refresh CPUs (http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1) are here and just like their predecessors they run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4790K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

<br />
It is indeed, obviously, the construction of the Portal on the Draenor side, not just because of the scales, but because of the mountain range, the wagons etc, it's all orcs and it's all Draenor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, if it was on Azeroth, the Dark Portal would be in a marsh (Black Morass).</div></div><hr />

I'd always imagined it was built out of stone bricks, or something. But now I think of it it always was just a huge seamless chunk of rock.</div></div><hr />

I usually enjoy them and find them to be &quot;spot on&quot;, this however, not so much.<br />

Maybe they've done this on purpose for fives though and will keep raid bosses about as on par as Gruul when it comes to mobility.</div></div><hr />

I'd be royally pissed off if it didn't. Already working to have 1 million gold on 3 servers to be able to buy it out if it shows up. I just don't know at what hours the BMAH resets...</div></div><hr />

Let's hope that the gameplay will be interesting and challenging as well, or it's gonna be just another non-memorable eye candy like there's plenty in WoW already.<br />
Well, that's more about the sort of tuning that we're gonna get for heroic 5-mans, at this expansion... Any hint about it, yet?<br />
<br />
Although I may also quote a good friend of mine, here, who used to comment on the Toy Train with noticing that he was playing a fucking fantasy game: what do trains have to do with it?</div></div><hr />

Both of the listed power supplies are excellent choices.</div></div><hr />

Very promising, it's a shame the other instances seem to pale in comparison. atleast on the visual front anyways. Also that concept art looks phenomenal, but i don't remember hearing of a mountain next to the Dark Portal. I know the details of it's construction were never truly fleshed out so filling in the small details is completely open to anything, but the final version has no mountain, so if they did choose this concept art for their inspiration, would the horde have blown away the rest of the mountain or something? Oh well. I just REALLY hope this movie can capture the essence of Warcraft and take people who think WoW is just killing monsters, or people who just don't know the game's story like us lore nerds, through some of it's rich lore in a more engaging way than books (suffice to say the books certainly are engaging) and youtube videos.</div></div><hr />

That mount is my pride. To bad its going to be a &quot;casual&quot; item now. At least we have the experience of getting the raptor in our hearts which can't be bought with gold ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both the &quot;Narwhal&quot; and &quot;Unicorn&quot; power supply have 4.5/5 and 5/5 stars on Amazon. Rosewill is actually a company is my top 3 trustee companies because they have never done me wrong. The only other companies I would trust over them are Corsair and Thermaltake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, it appears to literally use the same art assets and everything. If not for the outside-world view or the fact that you're moving, you wouldn't even be able to tell the difference.<br />
<br />
Orc steel, wood and crates is getting more tiresome by the day. And after 12+ months of SoO, they're the last thing I want to see in a &quot;new&quot; expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
... good choices, an excellent choice is an Enermax. In this case either a Enermax Platimax 750W or Modu87+ 700W. $50 more wont kill you to get an excellent power supply that will last you 5 years + reliably, consistently and way more efficiently.</div></div><hr />

The capitol is really your garrison, it's where you start from, where many things intersect, and ultimately = winning vs ??? (Muffinus)<br />

this answer is weird! did blizz think that a garrison is a personal capitol? then the concept of an mmo is false..</div></div><hr />

Seeing other players is totally cool, see: Dalaran. Flying to stuff because your hub is not near anything isn't cool. (Muffinus)<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Ashran the island off the coast? Seems like you put the hub far from everything...<br />
Looking at fast ways to get from your garrison to Ashran hub. Keep in mind: Garrison is in SMV/FF, you see a lot of them. (Muffinus)&quot;<br />

This isn't their best one, and their best stuff is in the past from what I can tell, but they still get a smile out of me, which is more than I can say about most horrible comics like Penny Arcade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think about it logically,i think they are trying to give the image that the portal was carved out of a mountain and the mountain bit attached is the last part of the portal being carved,portals of stone dont just pop up out of thin air,they are either built and put together or carved from an object (which would be twenty times easier).</div></div><hr />
