Season 3 begins today, bringing with it reward changes, Azshara's Eternal Palace raid, Operation: Mechagon mega dungeon, a new Mythic+ season/affix, and a new PvP season!<br />
<br />
Content Difficulty and Rewards Changes<br />
With a new raid opening, the item level of many rewards are going up!<br />
<br />
<br />
New Maximum Item Level: The maximum possible item level will go up to 455.<br />
Azshara's Eternal Palace: Gear from the new raid will range from LFR - 400, Normal - 415, Heroic - 430, Mythic - 445<br />
World Quest Emissary Rewards: On the PTR, World Quest item rewards ranged from 380 to 400 for a geared character. Azerite Armor was item level 385 from world quests and 415 as the max from emissaries.<br />
Dungeon Rewards and Difficulty: The item level of rewards from max-level Normal, Heroic, and Mythic dungeons will go up by 30. Baseline rewards will be 370 from Normal, 385 from Heroic, and 400 from non-Keystone Mythic. The new Mythic Only Dungeon Operation: Mechagon will have 415 baseline item level gear.<br />
Mythic Keystone Dungeons: Mythic+ rewards will also go up by 30 item levels. As with Season 2, during the first week of Season 3 Mythic Keystone Dungeon rewards will most likely be capped at item level 415 (420 on the PTR). Mythic Keystones from your weekly chest today will likely go down by 4 levels instead of 1 when the transition occurs. The chest you open on the first week of season 3 will contain Season 2 rewards if you did a Mythic+ run on the last week of Season 2. (So, for example, if you did a Mythic 10 during the final week of Season 2, you will get a Season 2 item level 410 piece and 600 Residuum from your first Season 3 chest today.)<br />
PvP: PvP Season 3 end-of-match rewards will also most likely be capped at 415 (420 on PTR) for the first week of the season. Rewards from rated PvP sources are 30 item levels higher than they were in Season 2, including Conquest rewards and the weekly chest.<br />
Seals of Wartorn Fate: Seals of Wartorn Fate are not being reset and this same currency can be used for Azshara's Eternal Palace and Season 3 bonus rolls; the cap on how many can be held at once remains at 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Raid - Azshara's Eternal Palace<br />
Normal and Heroic Azshara's Eternal Palace opens this week, with Mythic and Raid Finder (item level 380 required) opening next week.<br />

New Mega Dungeon - Operation: Mechagon<br />
A new eight boss mega dungeon is coming with unique gear and rewards to earn. There is also a way to activate a hard mode of the dungeon which will likely give a unique challenge and reward similar to the Nightbane run in Legion Karazhan.<br />

<br />
Once you’re feeling properly upgraded, it’s time to begin your bid to shut down King Mechagon once and for all and free the mechagnomes from his tyranny. Get ready for Operation Mechagon!<br />
<br />
Operation Mechagon <br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/june/thumb/operationmechthumb.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/june/operationmech.jpg) <br />
<br />
Prince Erazmin leads a group of unlikely allies on a desperate mission into the heart of Mechagon. In a race against time, they must overcome King Mechagon’s army of mechanized monstrosities and defeat the mad genius before his doomsday device purges all organic life from Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Dungeon Bosses: 8<br />
<br />
Difficulties: Mythic<br />
<br />
Level: 120 for Alliance and Horde<br />
<br />
King Gobbamak: Obsessed with hoarding dangerous technology found amongst the scrap, King Gobbamak sits upon a pile of doomsday weapons that he lacks the intelligence to operate or understand.<br />
<br />
Gunker: After years of coalescing into a concentrated cesspool. Mechagon's toxic waste has gained malevolent sentience. With the sanitation systems disabled, Gunker is free to ooze across all of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Trixie &amp; Naeno: Trixie and Naeno, two of Bondo’s top lieutenants, have a turbulent relationship. While Trixie prides herself on ruthless efficiency, Naeno is the embodiment of chaos while behind the wheel. The only thing they have in common is their penchant for senseless violence, which they enjoy dispensing on anyone foolish enough to wander into their territory.<br />
<br />
HK-8 Aerial Oppression Unit: Predator of the skies, the HK-8 Aerial Oppression Unit soars over the yard executing its prime directive, disintegrating all trespassers. With impenetrable armor and a lethal host of weapons, it annihilates all who are caught in its shadow.<br />
<br />
Tussle Tonks: Mechagon’s premier mechgineers test their mettle (and metal) by building customized combat robots. While these tonks typically battle each other for glory, they combine their efforts to repel foolhardy organic intruders who dare venture into Mechagon.<br />
<br />
K.U.-J.O.: As the repository for the city’s refuse, the Under Junk is a prime target for gnomes from Bondo’s gang who intend to steal valuable mechanical components. While Trash Mistress Wendy Cogsworth ceaselessly sorts the city’s junk, her loyal guard dog, K.U.-J.0., keeps out unwelcome intruders—mechagnomes and adventurers alike.<br />
<br />
Machinist's Garden: Beautiful and dangerous, Head Machinist Sparkflux's metallic gardens are designed for both recreation and retribution. With a flick of a switch, the idyllic scenery transforms into a death trap from which no interloper can escape.<br />
<br />
King Mechagon: As maniacal as he is brilliant, King Mechagon despises all organic life. With his mechoriginator primed and ready, nothing stands in the way of his scheme to purge the curse of flesh from Azeroth and mechanize the entire world.<br />
<br />
Get ready to face the danger within beginning July 9.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon Changes<br />
Rewards and difficulty are being buffed with the start of Season 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
The new seasonal affix is Beguiling (https://www.wowdb.com/affixes/119-beguiling)!<br />
<br />
Azshara's Emissaries are present throughout the dungeon.<br />
<br />
These emissaries will be placed in different trash packs each week.<br />
These emissaries do not die, but teleport away based on certain conditions.<br />
As of now they are affected by affixes, but do not give bolstering to other mobs when defeated.<br />
Removing them from the battle does progress the enemy forces bar.<br />
<br />
Emissary of the Tides<br />
<br />
Queen's Decree: Unstoppable (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/302418-queens-decree-unstoppable) - The Queen's Decree make all nearby allies immune to all non-damage effects.<br />
Queen's Decree: Unstoppable (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/302417-queens-decree-unstoppable) - Grants nearby allies Queen's Decree: Unstoppable.<br />
Will teleport when brought to 1 health.<br />
<br />
Enchanted Emissary<br />
<br />
Queen's Decree: Blowback (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/290027-queens-decree-blowback) - Grants nearby allies Queen's Decree: Blowback, reflecting 150% of damage dealt back at the target.<br />
Queen's Decree: Blowback (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/290026-queens-decree-blowback) - Reflects 150% of damage dealt back at the target.<br />
Attacks will knock the Enchanted Emissary back.<br />
Will teleport when her energy bar is empty.<br />
<br />
Void-Touched Emissary<br />
<br />
Queen's Decree: Hide (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/302420-queens-decree-hide) - Deals Shadow damage equal to 50% targets' health to enemies in line of sight within a 60 yard radius.<br />
Queen's Decree: Hide (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/302421-queens-decree-hide) - Increases Shadow damage dealt by 50%.<br />
Can see through Stealth and Invisibility.<br />
Will teleport when brought to 1 health.<br />
<br />
<br />
The item level of rewards from max-level Normal, Heroic, and Mythic dungeons will go up by 30. Baseline rewards will be 370 from Normal, 385 from Heroic, and 400 from non-Keystone Mythic. The Operation: Mechagon mega dungeon has baseline 415 item level rewards.<br />
Mythic + dungeon scaling is now 10% per level instead of 8%.<br />
Mythic Keystones will go down by an additional 3 levels when the season transition occurs to account for the difficulty increase. So if you did an 11 the last week of season 2, expect a level 7 key instead of a 10 in your chest when the new season starts.<br />
Mythic+ rewards will also go up by 30 item levels; however, during the first week of Season 3, rewards from end-of-run mythic+ chests will likely be capped at item level 415 (420 on PTR). The chest you open on the first week of season 3 will contain Season 2 rewards if you did a Mythic+ run on the last week of Season 2. (So, for example, if you did a Mythic 10 during the final week of Season 2, you will get a Season 2 item level 410 piece and 600 Residuum from your first Season 3 chest today.)<br />
The weekly cache that becomes available in the second week of the season will not be affected by this cap. If a player does a Mythic 10 dungeon during this coming week, they will get a Mythic 10 reward from their cache the following week.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Titan Residuum<br />
<br />
Titan Residuum (https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum) will still be rewarded from Mythic+ weekly chests, occasional Treasure Map missions, and by scrapping or disenchanting Azerite armor.<br />
Titan Residuum (https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum) is not reset or capped between seasons.<br />
Titan Residuum (https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum) awarded from your weekly cache will increase proportionately.<br />
Thaumaturge Vashreen (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/149045-thaumaturge-vashreen) will offer item level 415, 430, and 445 pieces for sale in Season 3.<br />
<br />
Random 415 - 1,725 Titan Residuum (https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum)<br />
Random 430 - 9,000 Titan Residuum (https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum)<br />
Random 445 - 47,500 Titan Residuum (https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum)<br />
Specific 445 - 200,000 Titan Residuum (https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle for Azeroth PvP Season 3<br />
PvP Season 3 will start today with all new rewards and gear to earn.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP Season 3 end-of-match rewards will also most likely be capped at 415 (420 on PTR) for the first week of the season. Rewards from rated PvP sources are 30 item levels higher than they were in Season 2, including Conquest rewards and the weekly chest.<br />

<br />
Heroic Battle for Stromgarde Warfront<br />
Season 3 introduces Heroic Warfronts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Initially heroic is only available for Battle for Stromgarde.<br />
Heroic Warfronts are tuned for item level 415.<br />
A team of 10 to 20 will be needed to que for a Heroic Warfront.<br />
Heroic Warfronts will be much different from normal warfronts.<br />
Heroic Warfronts will focus on the strategic aspects found in RTS games. Examples of new challenges include special units sent at your base that needs to be defended, the enemy commander appearing on the field, or where to best put resources at the moment.<br />
You can lose a Heroic Warfront.<br />
<br />

Never understood it either, the only answers I've ever gotten while asking was &quot;because it's a mega dungeon&quot; or the old &quot;just git gud&quot; nonsense. From what I've seen locking an entire dungeon behind the mythic label just causes alot of people to avoid it.<br />

<br />
&quot;The chest you open on the first week of season 3 will contain Season 2 rewards if you did a Mythic+ run on the last week of Season 2. (So, for example, if you did a Mythic 10 during the final week of Season 2, you will get a Season 2 item level 410 piece and 600 Residuum from your first Season 3 chest today.)&quot;<br />

Is your beef the difficulty or the fact that you can't use group finder to queue for the dungeon?<br />
<br />
If it's the former, mythic difficulty is a misnomer nowadays and is actually pretty much what heroic used to be known as. If it's the latter, you're the antisocial one in this scenario, because you need Blizzard to forcefully place you into a random group rather than you going and finding your own through various means.<br />
<br />
I find that people who complain about others being toxic to them are generally unskilled players who have no interest in improving and are offended when people rightfully point out that they're a leech on the rest of the group's efforts. Saying someone &quot;achieved something arbitrary&quot; points to your entire misunderstanding of the point of gaming. You are exactly who Blizzard shouldn't be catering to, IMO.<br />

Never said it was, I'm saying people avoid it that's all. Mythic 0 is what heroic used to be, but still it makes me wonder why it's mythic only? <br />
<br />
It doesn't add anything or make it more special.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It adds relevance to the dungeon as an end-game push (with better base rewards) because it's not designed for fresh 120s or new players to waltz into through a group-finder tool and then complain about getting bonked on the head by their own incompetence. At least they didn't introduce a rep requirement this time.<br />
<br />
It will eventually become a heroic-enabled dungeon when the content passes it by.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is not antisocial to want to queue for a dungeon, anti-social would be not queuing for the dungeon at all or avoiding the dungeon system altogether. There are days where I wish people would just shut their own traps and there are others where it is nice to carry on a conversation. What I should not have to be forced into is trying to make a group on my own, whether I have the ilvi or skill or whatever is used by many as a criteria to either join or participate in someone else's group. I had enough of that garbage when I first started playing this game. <br />
<br />
Oddly, I find most people I wait some period of time to group with back then not worthy of the time that was invested in spending massive amounts of time gathering only to have one or two or even three people not be able to get along, which is really nothing different in many regards to the LFD then and now. To say that everyone that uses a premade group have no problems or issues would be rather disingenuous at best. Egos in this game, which is not like any other game, are simply lack the ability to keep in check enough to enjoy the content that one is trying to experience. <br />
<br />
That said, given the person you responded to, I have zero problem or issue with this Mechagon being Mythic only, It will in the next patch or two be made normal and heroic. Might not have all the other bells and whistles and mounts and such, but it will still be available and I am fine with that. I think, it is great that Blizzard makes exclusive content for people that enjoy doing that level of content. <br />
<br />
I think, more people that call other antisocial are themselves far more antisocial because of the people they choose to block out of group content for whatever their reasons maybe. The LFD does not have that problem, it just matches people up to do a dungeon and largely move on with their lives and on to the next dungeon. I have found doing premade dungeons to be more like raiding groups that in many cases are incapable of getting along. That is not to say that the LFD is any better. In this game you have to fit a certain mold if you want to group with other people or have people group with yourself. If you do not fit that mold, tough crap, you are simply out of luck.<br />
<br />
I tend to avoid doing dungeons (beyond doing them each once at the beginning of an expansion or patch) and I have chosen not to raid, mostly because I find I am grouped with far to many people that are at best, undesirable to put it into a term that would not flag me on these forums.</div></div><hr />

You've really done a fantastic job of over-dramatizing the process of finding your own group. Related note: I bet this has no relevance whatsoever on your ability to get along in groups. /s<br />
<br />
LFD has it's purposes and I'm not knocking it for what it is, but in the lens of what we're discussing here, it's the equivalent of having your mom force your classmates' parents into allowing you to be invited to the sleepover. It's not going to make you learn anything about being a socially compatible person and you'll just go on thinking that it's everyone else's fault that you suck. Meanwhile, everyone else goes on with their lives and has none of the same problems you do.</div></div><hr />

I am never the problem, I always do what I have to get the job done and move on. It has always been another in the party that has always had an issue with someone else or a couple people having problems with another. So no, in my own experiences with both premade and LFD, I have found both to be more like one another and even more so in the latter stages of this game. There are a lot of dickheads out there that literally are incapable of keeping their own egos in check long enough to complete a dungeon. When I first start this game there were less of those types of people, that is not the case today, but then it is not just WoW that I have experienced this nonsense or with speaking with others on having similar experiences. <br />
<br />
When I do group content, or when I have done group content, I leave my ego at the door and do and listen to what I am supposed to be doing as my part. I did the same when I raided, if anything, I got invited back for being so humble in being for the group and not for myself. I have been sociable all my life, though when people are not able to conduct themselves appropriately, there is no point in being sociable to them. They feel more inclined to be an a$$, than wanting to do content. That is fine, they can find another group of people that are like minded to their own ego.</div></div><hr />

No it shouldn't.Just because something becomes easier with better gear doesn't mean everything must be in the dungeon finder.There must exist something to which isn't made for fresh 120s or new players comming from the queueable mindles heroics which tought them nothing!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mythic 0's should be added and not changed in any way other than adding them to the LFG (Perhaps they should require something to unlock them? or a certain item level, or something?). They're really not any more difficult than pre-MoP dungeons, save for a couple of very specific parts (and even then, I think for the most part, they're about on par with heroics in WoD, again, save for some very specific spots), and there's really no reason to have the lock other than to, well... have the lock. (I think it'd also have the benefit of getting a whole lot more people interested in doing mythic+ when they get keys, which I also think a lot of people hate the idea of, since they probably think it'll increase the &quot;riff raff&quot; in their pugs)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Puddlejumper</div><div class="date">2019-07-09, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda surprised people want heroic Mechagon. What's the point? It wouldn't drop better loot than other heroics, and the fights would still essentially lack any mechanics, so all you're really in for is the scenery/voice acting, which you can get by watching Twitch, with the added benefit of not having people randomly afk on you, and also not needing to pay a $15 subscription. Admittedly Twitch isn't quite as easy to fall asleep to as a heroic, if you're looking for a sleep aid...<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, tourist mode stuff is important to have in the game as a catchup mechanic, so people don't just have no clue what the story is. Honestly I think there should be Uldir 5-mans and BoD 5-mans you can queue for also, for that reason. But heroics aren't a meaningful part of endgame and haven't been, for years, so making current content queue-able seems counterproductive - all it would do is give more people an excuse not to play the game.</div></div><hr />

M0 is by no means a burden for anyone who plays this game reasonably and doesn't treat it like a game where you click a button and loot pops out.<br />
<br />
It's neither. The difficulty doesn't bother me. And raid finder... well, I would like to use it for mythic, if the people there accept what they are in for. But they don't even do that for raids. If I use the raid finder, I accept that I will be grouped with people who may not know the boss, who may have difficulties with certain mechanics and that the whole encounter may end in a wipe. And that's fine to me.<br />
But with mythic, it tends to put people in a mindset where they think of themselves as elite or something like that. And making something mythic only enforces this. It's not that I have not the possibility to play this content. My contact list is indeed short because I am old and quite picky with the people I like to deal. But it is large enough to do the content. It's what I see outside of my circle. Maybe I am the antisocial one, but I really don't want to deal with other people, if those people prove to me again and again, that they can't be nice to each other. That there always some kind of competition going on about who's more worth as a Player, who is more entitled to something and so on.<br />
Maybe I am the one who is problematic... since I am the one who has a different view than the majority. I am fine with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
good times.<br />
<br />
now all they've done is have 3 things for premade groups; heroic warfront, raid and mythic dungeon.<br />
<br />
what a step forward blizz<br />
