Patch 5.2 Dev Interviews<br />
Today we continue our interviews recap with an interview with Tom Chilton by Blizzplanet (http://www.twizzcast.com/shows/2013/3/1/an-interview-with-tom-chilton.html)!<br />
<br />
Blizzplanet (http://www.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/interview-with-wow-game-director-tom-chilton-mists-of-pandaria-patch-5-2)<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler's unannounced feature might be in Patch 5.4 if it is complete in time. As far as a hint goes, &quot;A lot of players have suggested that they be able to do older content, so it is something along those lines&quot;.<br />
If Mists of Pandaria could be done over, there isn't much that would be changed, other than how mandatory daily quests felt. <br />
Hopefully this is as slow as new content will ever be delivered from now on!<br />
Part of the team has been split off to work on the odd number patches, Patch 5.1, 5.3, and maybe even Patch 5.5!<br />
The rest of the team works on the even numbed patches with raids, Patch 5.0, 5.2, and Patch 5.4.<br />
The team working on WoW has also been enlarged, and is now bigger than ever before. The team size will be increased as time goes on.<br />
The tech used for Sunsong Ranch moves the tech closer to the possibility of player housing, but defining what it is, why it would be cool, and how it would work is still not there yet.<br />
The changes made to the Patch 5.0 raid failbags were smaller, but should be more significant with the Patch 5.2 bonus roll improvements. Even when you don't win loot, you should have a chance to win something cool like old mounts or things that were used to incentivize tanks in dungeon finder. Another option mentioned for bonus rolls or failbags is some Valor Points or increased amount of gold. <br />
Challenge modes are still working out well, but it isn't expected that most players will take part due to the difficulty. There aren't any major changes planned and the feature will continue to be used in the future. <br />
Thunderforged items are less about getting 10 man raid groups to switch to 25 man than they are about rewarding 25 man groups for the increased complexity. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thunderforged Items Drop Rate<br />
WoWProgress took a look at the gear worn by guilds that have killed Jin'rokh the Breaker (http://www.wowprogress.com/encounter/jin-rokh-the-breaker) and found that there is roughly a 10% drop chance in 10 man and 25% drop chance in 25 man.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to Rehabilitation Clinic (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/azgalor/Rehabilitation+Clinic/rating.tier15_10) and Exodus (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/mal-ganis/Exodus) for finishing up Lei Shen first last week. Good luck to everyone this week! <br />

Blue Posts<br />
10 Player Raids and Tier Tokens<br />
Then on top of that I found out about the t15 token changes, where it isn't a guaranteed drop in 10 man anymore, 0-2 tokens can drop, and in 25 2-4 tokens can drop. Which puts double RNG into tier, making it especially bad for 10 man cause they can continuously get zero tier. On top of that 10 man is tuned much tighter then 25. 1 Person messes up your likely to wipe unless you really outgear the content. It seems blizzard is trying to completely revive 25 mans and put 10 mans in its grave.. <br />
Having 0 tier tokens drop for 10 person raid groups was unintended. We're currently looking to address this in a coming hotfix similar to the one that had been implemented for 25 person raid groups.<br />
<br />
From Patch 5.2 Hotfixes - March 7:<br />
- The appropriate number of tier tokens should now drop for 25-player normal and heroic difficulties. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/256497-10-25-man-loot/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8196599690?page=1#6))<br />

Paladin PvP Feedback<br />
Me: So im sorry, but im a little bit confused. Firstly, what do Paladins who just go Holy have to do w/ this question? is he trying to say that all the Paladins who are in Glad range as Holy magically played Ret and then re-speced for giggles? Anyone care to explain to me what he is trying to say? As well, Holy is good, but... honestly, imba? a bit of a stretch id say, the spec is balanced. <br />
Holy, as I understand, is one of the highest represented healers at top ratings right now. While I am not saying from this information we can conclude that holy is &quot;imba&quot;, but they are definitely one of the strongest healers at the moment. Healers are also in a higher demand than DPS as more people want to be the one wailing away on the opponent. <br />
<br />
I also feel that you are twisting what is being said by GC, he did not state that they magically hit glad range after respeccing, it is just that holy is such a strong spec in PvP comparatively to Ret that many highly ranked paladins may have switched to it for the competitive advantage it holds.<br />
<br />
Me: So every Ret is in fact insane for choosing that spec in the first place? ok, im sure we all knew that, I did anyways, but what else are we getting told here? That since Holy is strong that Ret should stay broken and all Paladins should roll Holy? whats the point of a talent tree?<br />
<br />
Once again, the success of Holy Paladins this season is getting used in a very sad way to overshadow and justify keeping Rets down <br />
You are twisting his words again, and wouldn't the words &quot;imba&quot; and &quot;OP&quot; be meaning the same thing in the way they are both used? That Holy is above average.<br />
<br />
The success of Holy paladins in this season is not being used as an excuse to &quot;keep Rets down&quot;. He is just saying that the number of rets represented at higher ratings is probably low because many highly rated players want to take advantage of the benefits that lie in playing as Holy.<br />
<br />
We have mentioned many times that we want and are attempting to improve the current state of Ret paladins, as can be seen in the patch notes. The success of one spec is not a reason to leave another in the cold, in a perfect world all specs would be equal but sadly it is not entirely plausible. We don't feel that Rets aren't viable right now or that they are bad, it's just that they simply don't perform as well as Holy and that is why their representation is lower.<br />
<br />
Me: Ok, I can agree that Holy never rly had any offensive pressure as far as CC goes, that is if we dont count the first 1-2? seasons of Wotlk, but ok nvm. Holy was solid tons of times before, and is generally one of the strongest Healing specs. Was op a few times, but that is sorted. And imo? thats fine, if a spec works good and is not op then its fine. <br />
Your picking at semantics with the &quot;OP&quot; statements now. The general idea that he is trying to get across is that Holy is a strong spec that is capable of outperforming other healers right now, it also has benefits that outweigh those given by Ret, so many of them changed to Holy. <br />
<br />
Alright... so from what I can see, mentioning that Holy is OP and imba in 3 out of the 4 questions that are generally about Ret tells me that Holy is gonna get stuffed. As well, their constant denial of what is going on w/ Rets indicates that no real changes are going to happen. Ret will get some love in 5.2, no questions there, our dmg will go up by a nudge, but the main problem remains, we are the #1 target for zerging down due to not having a realistic PvP defensive kit for this expansion. <br />
Holy is receiving a few changes (most notable is the nerf to their CC chain) to lower their strengths, there are not many as you can see in the patch notes and they are far from being prevented from remaining competitive. In regards to your concern of Ret paladins receiving no survivability buffs, the patch notes show that they are receiving some very beneficial changes to their survivability and utility as well as minor increase to their damage. <br />
<br />
Balance, Feral, Windwalker, Retribution, Shadow, Enhancement and Elemental now gain 25% of the bonus healing provided by PvP Power (was 0). Dedicated healers will continue to gain 50% of the bonus healing, and no bonus damage, from PvP Power. Sword of Light now increases Flash of Light by 100% (was 30%) and increases the Paladin's damage with two-handed melee weapons by 15% (was 10%). When Hand of Sacrifice is cast by a Retribution Paladin, all harmful magic effects are removed from the party or raid member. Hand of Purity now reduces all incoming damage by 10% in addition to its other effects. Eternal Flame's periodic heal now provides 100% more healing when self-cast. <br />
<br />
There are of course other changes but these are only the increases to Rets survivability. I think that is a pretty big list of buffs, and that's not including any additional changes that have been made but not announced just yet. So you can expect an increase to your survivability, damage and utility come patch 5.2, Rets are far from not getting any real changes.

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/march/ssdgraph.gif) seem to have bottomed out for now, with almost all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte. No new CPUs, GPUs, or SSDs worth waiting for are expected before late in the second quarter this year.<br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 3770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Failbags are still....fail!<br />
<br />
While I did get 3 drops out of 10 eligible kills (and then 2 more on bonus rolls) - the 7 failbags I got all contained...gold. I know...random is random...but at least double the gold for the failures like me :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ambushu</div><div class="date">2013-03-11, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what I would like to see about the surprise coming in 5.4 is that all old raids scale to 90 and tier from that era be scaled up to current level tier and the set bonuses of old gear like T1-14 stay the same. So have like level 90 bloodfang. Heres bloodfang set bonuses:<br />
(3) Set: Increases the chance to apply poisons to your target by 5%.<br />
(5) Set: Improves the damage reduction of Feint by 5%.<br />
(8) Set: Gives the Rogue a chance to inflict 283 to 317 damage on the target and heal the Rogue for 50 health every 1 sec. for 6 sec. on a melee hit.<br />
<br />
Have the 8 piece set scale for the damage infliction to proper level obviously. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that is something that wont be easy to make. Sure you can give those aforementioned things, but game mechanics have changed quite a lot since then.<br />
Whole healing went from reactive to pro-active and dispel having a cooldown to make priests mandatory for some fights.<br />
Tanking mechanics aswell from casual big ability hits which required you to use that 3-5min damage reduce CD to more active mitigation style.<br />
And as you might have noticed. The talents and abilities have changed big time to screw any sort of dps balance there used to be.<br />

This would make a lot of sense as without this challange modes would pretty much have to be closed off for the current dungeons once the new xpac hits. It could also allow Wintergrasp and TB to be put back to the level it was allowing players who haven't yet got to max level to try those out.<br />

I really don't think it's going to be a low level server.</div></div><hr />

Obviously not. /disappointed<br />
<br />
Hopefully they're not stupid enough to remove the original raids and force us to run level 90/deleveled versions for xmog/mounts/achvs.<br />
<br />
Had quite enough of that with the removed ZG mounts...</div></div><hr />

Sure you can give those aforementioned things, but game mechanics have changed quite a lot since then.<br />
Whole healing went from reactive to pro-active and dispel having a cooldown to make priests mandatory for some fights.<br />
Tanking mechanics aswell from casual big ability hits which required you to use that 3-5min damage reduce CD to more active mitigation style.<br />
And as you might have noticed. The talents and abilities have changed big time to screw any sort of dps balance there used to be.<br />
<br />
Besides, i can't see much use for the whole thing. Roll blood dk if you want to make the old raids your personal playground.<br />
It is doubtful that Blizzard will get them to be tuned perfectly. You are right a lot has changed in the game including tanks that can self heal along with DPS and a plethora of class abilities that have changed game play. At the least we could hope that the relative power balance is still there even though new mechanics could make a number of them moot. A lot of the old content also has lots of trash and CC so I am not sure how that will make an impact with todays player base. The other issue would be if Blizzard is going to attach a motivational reward system to these given how much the player base has become so materialistic and its impact on the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
... disappoint? Depends on how they do it<br />
<br />
Using the scaling system to do old content would be awesome. The biggest issue is probably how they are going to tune the rewards. Competitive gear is out of the question, but mounts, statless gear for transmog, pets and other things would suffice.<br />
They have the tech to scale stats, and mob health/damage depending on numbers of players, so hopefully a group of 5 90s would have a similar experience to a group of 3, or 8<br />
<br />
As long its a toggleable mode I'm okay with them &quot;rehashing&quot; old raids for some fun.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wishblade</div><div class="date">2013-03-11, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just can't see how it'd be old instances scaled up to 90 when they've recently (a few days ago) said that scaling content is something they'll do whenever they have the time, meaning surely it won't be around for some time. That's just how I see it...<br />
<br />
If it does turn out to be old instances, then the rewards better be damn sweet otherwise I see no point, you can still go visit all those places afterall. And some bosses would need to be spiced up a bit or altered slightly. Some of those old bosses would be boring as hell nowadays. And of course, should be toggeable so people can still solo old stuff, would be sad to see all the neat stuff go away.<br />
<br />
I just hope it's something awesome that's not old content rehashed, and if so the rewards should at least be awesome and it should feel fun to go back to those places.</div></div><hr />

Sing me out, I don't like the idea, at all. Been playing since vanilla, and in my opinion, nostalgia aside, the game is so much better in many ways nowadays, it's just not 'fresh' anymore and is a predictable experience overall. People asking for vanilla servers etc. I just don't get them. Well, there you go, you'll get to gather up and kill Ragnaros all over again while romanticizing about the past and stuff.<br />
<br />
.... then again, they might do it in a way that is completely awesome. No high hopes, but I can't rule that possibility out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. I think it's a retarded waste of DEV time to constantly retune old content for all the class-mechanic changes they make.<br />
<br />
Besides: I have almost everything I want for transmog anyway (only need HC25 T10 and some cata T11 stuff), so the feature would be completely useless to me.<br />

<br />
I miss the point of this question. <br />
<br />
Leveling is so fast, you can get from 1-90 in about 2 weeks of real causal play, or couple of days if you play a lot. That said, I don't have real life friends who are just now joining World of Warcraft, most of them are already 90, on different servers or quit, as for guild friends, same story, most are 90, if they re-roll an alt, it's their business not mine. <br />
<br />
I also don't think anyone would like to do Molten Core, even new players, when they could be doing new raids where they can buff their character with highest gear possible, as opposed of getting vanity items and what not in old raids (suppose Blizzard wont be giving lvl90 ilvl 550+ gear in Molten Core or Icecrown Citadel, cause that would just be dumb). <br />
<br />
As said I'm playing this game since release in Europe, and I've spend a lot of time in every possible dungeon or raid instance, to ever want to do them again with the intended difficulty. I'm not a world-first guild, so I'll focus my time on the most recent raid instance that is released instead and that is showing to be all-time consuming already.<br />
<br />
What would be an awesome feature, is to have an arena like the Brawlers guild where you could load up any boss from the past and current and practice on him with your guild 10 or 25, normal or heroic. But I'd rather they focus on new character models and character customization, so not everyone really looks exactly the same, like painting gear adding some artistic changes to armor etc., - I don't care that much about this, but it helps to immerse you more with the game if not every T6 warrior looks exactly the same, but maybe one has some purity seals hanging from his shoulders, the other one has skulls on the shoulder spikes and what not.</div></div><hr />

When you enter the dungeon/raid, your level, stats and gear will be scaled down to the original intended values.<br />
<br />
This just sounds perfectly awful to me. I just can't conceive of being so terribly bored that I'd rerun an old dungeon or raid that I've very likely previously run nearly to the point of puking with my gear and such scaled down so that I could somehow revel in my 12k DPS?? I'd rather logout and watch reruns of sitcoms from the 80s.</div></div><hr />

I read just last week in a dev post where he said something to the effect of &quot;no plans yet but maybe one day we would like to adjust player stats and gear to lower levels&quot; or something like that. I'm trying to find it. To me it sounds like a gear and stats scaling thing to the effect of what GW2 has.</div></div><hr />
