Check http://jointheraid.com/site/stream/ right now. The site says &quot;Live Stream from Anaheim, CA Starts at 10pm Pacific&quot;<br />
Yesterday, I'm pretty sure it said 6pm.<br />
<br />
Yeah, that's 4 hours (I'm english so i have no idea how US time works so correct me if I'm wrong.)<br />
<br />
The only reason I think that it's from the pre-screening is because that was right after last year's Blizzcon, in Anaheim, CA, starting at 10pm Pacific :P<br />

OH FUCK ITS STARTING YESSSSSSSSSS BRB</div></div><hr />

Apparently you think documentaries can be planned, sponsorship gained, funding collected, filmed in different parts of the country, edited and released in less than a month when content become &quot;dated&quot;.<br />

boring? what do you expect it was a documentary not an action flick. And of course it's going to be dated, it takes time to produce movies.</div></div><hr />

I enjoyed it, but it needed more content; I would have enjoyed it more were it a 2hr movie.<br />
<br />
The length of item came due to needing to record and interview people that were spread around the country. In fact, the BIGGEST delay in the production was a funding issue.</div></div><hr />

You should probably think about what spews forth from that piehole before you post. I understand how film production works having been involved in many myself.<br />
<br />
Pre production could have started months before any footage was shot. The only thing that could not have been prepared earlier was the actual footage itself as well as post production. And if youre suggesting it takes 9-10 months to cut and release a production of this quality then I can assure you that Im not the idiot.<br />

The video is exactly the same as the one played at Blizzcon. <br />
The stream is lagging, even at 240p.<br />
<br />
I'm out.<br />
The pre-screening they showed on Blizzcon was only about 25 minutes or so I think. The full length was around 45 so no, it was not exactly the same. If it was ready last year I think they would have released it last year.<br />
<br />
But don't worry if it lagged for you during the event. The documentary will be up for 72 hours for viewing until they remove it from free viewing.</div></div><hr />

How did you phrase your question? Did you ask if the show was going to be international or if the competition was going to be international? Also, did you ask TypeFrag (the ones in charge of the competition) or someone else (like gamebreaker.tv)?</div></div><hr />

This was what I was left wondering afterwards. Is this supposed to be something you play for your confused parents or relatives? Cause if that's the case, I don't think I'd be willing to show other gamers howling &quot;OHHH WE'RE GONNA GET RAPED BY THAT LOLOL&quot; then try to explain that they're not social misfits afterwards as compelling viewing.<br />
<br />
Was also watching this with a bunch of guildmates. We were all shocked that the doc ended so quickly. I mean, as far as documentaries go, it was short as hell and didn't have much of a point other than &quot;hay guise herez my raidmates we teaze ech othur a lot and we have a GIRRRLLLLL.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
tbh it's not really for you its not really for me its for the non gamer/ person who doesn't know what the hell a mmo is, if you go into it with that state of mind i think it accomplished its goals.<br />
<br />
If you go into this movie thinking its gonna be a raid guide or something geared towards gamers then your gonna be disappointed.<br />
<br />
It's a documentary, most documentary's teach you about a certain aspect of a topic an for a first movie i think this did a great job of teaching a non gamer what warcraft is, especially in the setting they chose.<br />
If your looking for a warcraft movie Blizzard will be making that soonish.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaurianna</div><div class="date">2011-08-07, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really was honestly very excited about this film, I felt it could be an interesting and informative film to share with friends and family who don't know what I do in my free time, and enlighten them about exactly what it is. My attitude about this after having watched it has gone from excitement to embarrassment and disappointment. I was hoping to see more about the preparation that goes into a raid, how they are organized and explaining more about it as if talking to a non gamer, while they did some of it there is a lot of lingo they didn't cover, for example what is a wipe? I also think that the guy with the beard needed to be seriously edited or cut out. Yes plenty of gamers have a dirty mouth, it comes with the territory, but his was over the top, I don't even think I've ever had a pug that talked that way in vent. I also seem to remember a lot of footage on youtube for promo purposes that was not in the film at all. In short, it could have been a lot better and I'm highly disappointed, I will not be downloading this, buying it OR showing it to anyone I know. On the other hand, I will say that I think this guy has broken some ground for more documentaries like this, I know if i was a filmmaker i would be willing to do it. I commend him for the hard work and effort he put into the film, after all time money and effort did go into it. He deserves at least a small amount of respect for his accomplishment, while it did not deserve the hype around it, for a first production it was beautifully shot and had some great music and ingame footage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They attempted to explain what MMOs are but gave nothing to relate with.<br />
Slow downward spiral showing how depressing that guilds members are. First 2/3s of the video were all about how they failed in school and they abandoned their friends to play WoW. Not to mention the fact that they swear nonstop. I wouldn't show this to anyone I know who doesn't play MMOs because of the poor misrepresentation of many hardcore MMO players as well as the fact that the poor production value does little to censor what they are saying.<br />
I'm sad for the people who had hopes for this video and actually donated to its cause because once it releases it will be cannon fodder for Fox News to further slander the MMO community.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this was the perfect guild to explain ICC though because they clearly are Months Behind. Them calling LK the hardest fight Blizzard has ever made is embarrassing to anyone who raided in Vanilla or actually killed M'uru pre-nerf.<br />
