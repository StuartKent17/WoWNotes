10-Man Ulduar Achievements<br />
Having a hardcore 25player guild getting both the 25 and 10 player realm firsts doesn't seem right. We want there to be an end goal for each one to shoot for, if you want to run both, that's up to you - but this way the guilds that only run the normal version have an end goal to shoot for that the hardcore 25 player guilds can't swipe. <br />
<br />
To try and clear up any confusion, the planned item level for the achievement in Ulduar 10 is item level 226. This level gear drops from both hard mode Ulduar 10 and regular boss kills in Ulduar 25. So yes, while players who clear Ulduar 25 will get more 226 gear at a faster pace and possibly get this achievement first, it's an achievement anybody can do, so when a guild that only runs normal Ulduar 10 progresses through the instance and gets the hard modes done, they will be ready to take on this achievement.<br />
<br />
Reward: Herald of the Titans (title)<br />
<br />
If you primarily run 25 player instances and want to get this achievement/title, just hang on to your Kel'thuzad weapons and regular Ulduar 25 boss kills and you should be good to go.<br />
<br />
[...] <br />
The discussion (at least as far as I know, it's been all over the place) is about how we removed the Ulduar 10 player &quot;realm first&quot; feats of strength and we are working on replacing it with something else.<br />
<br />
We are looking to replace these 10 player &quot;realm first&quot; feats with a regular achievement that anybody can do but is focused on being the pinnacle of progression for players who focus on 10 player raids while minimizing the advantage that players have in heroic 25 player raids.<br />

Blue posts<br />
Additional Frostwyrms in 3.1<br />
No additional frost wyrms are being added in patch 3.1, we will see what the future holds beyond that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/16019603150-new-310-frost-wyrm-mount.html))<br />
<br />
Noblegarden in 3.1<br />
There are a few things to note:<br />
The new version of Noblegarden lasts one week, not one day.<br />
If you're looking at previous maps put together for egg-hunting, they're not going to be very effective. Eggs are spawned solely around the level 5ish towns (Goldshire, Brill, etc.) and there are always eggs up, even if many people are farming them. If you haven't found them, it isn't a matter of spawning... it's a matter of you not finding them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/16019603463-feedback-noblegarden.html))<br />

Arena Season 6: One-week grace period at the end of Season 5<br />
There will be a week between the end of season 5 and the start of season 6 where players will have time to spend points they've earned. In other words, you'll have one week from the day 3.1 hits to spend your points. <br />
<br />
This confuses me a little - let's say hypothetically season 5 ends tomorrow - from your wording, season 6 will start the next tuesday. So there'll basically be a &quot;dead&quot; week for arena when there is no season going on at all?<br />
Correct. We're giving a one-week grace period for players to spend accumulated points from season 5 since we're wiping them at the start of season 6. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16019533935-arena-ending-date.html))<br />

Dual Specialization and Buffs<br />
If you have a buff on you that another player cast, it should not go away when you switch specs.<br />
<br />
If you have a buff tied to a particular talent spec, it will go away on you when you switch specs.<br />
<br />
If you have a buff tied to a particular talent spec, it will generally not go away on the rest of the group. The general rule here is it’s as if you left the raid. So paladin blessings (which go away if you leave the raid) will go away. Improved Fortitude will not go away if you change specs to a spec without Improved Fort (though it will fall off of you), as those stay when you leave the raid.

No walking animation on Hippogryphs<br />

Amani War Bear bugfix in 3.1<br />
I looked into it and this is something we are aware of and working on changes. The problem is that we are working on setting this up so it works properly for all races. Going from a gnome to a tauren is quite a bit of different in size which affects the character and their positioning. We will see where it ends up when 3.1 launches.

Feral in Wrath of the Lich King<br />
To be clear, we used to be happy with cats doing relatively low dps and bears being inferior tanks, and low Feral PvP representation was acceptable since druids had a very potent PvP spec as an alternative. Our design has evolved for LK, and we want cats to be doing similar dps to say warriors, paladins and shamans, bears to be able to MT, and for Feral to be viable as a PvP spec. <br />
<br />
Primal Tenacity Nerf<br />
It was strictly for PvP. Short of cases like Maexxna, we’re not convinced it's a huge tanking issue and we definitely don’t want to try and carve out some kind of ill-conceived niche for druids as the best tanks while stunned. We just weren't happy with the way that talent worked. Relative power in Arenas is something we take into account, but it is not the only thing we take into account. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16019603046-feral-nerfs-why-no-dialogue.html))<br />
<br />
Feral Changes in 3.1 and scaling<br />
Some of the Feral changes in 3.1 were to handle scaling problems, some which would have made druids too good or not good enough. Savage Roar made AP trump all. The armor changes were made in part because bears we were worried bears were going to hit the armor cap (esp. with procs up, etc.) It is something we keep an eye on definitely. However, I also think “we won’t scale” tends to get a little over-emphasized in some of these threads. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16019603046-feral-nerfs-why-no-dialogue.html))<br />

Hunter nerfs<br />
There is this perception I think that we nerfed hunters because of ammo changes. We nerfed hunters because they were doing too much damage (and SS was a larger portion of total damage than we wanted).<br />
<br />
I did say that we were going to redo some portions of the hunter equation for 3.1, which we did with changes to Explosive Shot, TNT, pet talent trees, Chimera Shot and all the other changes in the patch notes. When we redo ammo, we'll have to redo them all again. We made sure that hunters will continue to scale satisfactorily into the next couple of tiers of content, but if you think we made a mistake somewhere, feel free to point it out. But you need to be specific. Saying &quot;We don't scale&quot; isn't sufficient, because you in fact do.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=630) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?rogue))<br />
Hunger for Blood<br />
So, there seems to be this perception that we are going to nerf HfB because a few players are trying to use it for PvP (and apparently mostly for 1v1 duels against targets who don't run around much).<br />
<br />
I am going to assume this is one of those deals where some of you are reading the blue quotes out of context or not reading the entire thread. Therefore, at the risk of derailing this thread, I will sum up the Hunger for Blood story one more time.<br />
<br />
1) We like where Assassination rogues are in PvP. You can have excellent crowd control, and decent burst, survivability and mobility. We think adding more damage on top of this would be too good, which is why we nerfed Mutilate in the first place.<br />
<br />
2) However, that same basic build doesn't do enough sustained damage in PvE.<br />
<br />
3) Our solution was to make 51 Assassination a large increase in damage for PvE. To confine it to PvE, we made it require a bleed effect, and we stuck it to the bottom of the tree where it is out of reach of the traditional PvP Mutilate / Prep spec. You can have your damage (presumably for raiding) or you can have your utility (presumably for Arenas) but you can't have both.<br />
<br />
4) If we were trying to get the Assassination tree enshrined in the Game Design Hall of Fame, would this be our approach? No. Ideally, talents are not so skewed towards PvE or PvP. Ideally a single talent point wouldn't account for so much dps. Ideally there might be a strong PvP spec that uses the 51 point talent. Can we design an Assassination tree that does that? Yes, but it would involve moving around a lot of other talents. Since we think rogues are where we want them in PvP and where we want them in PvE, we think the risk of hacking apart the talent trees for 3.1 in order to create a single Assassination build that is good in PvE and PvP isn't worth the reward. It might be something we look at in the future though.<br />
<br />
5) This is where I note that we had plenty of posts that said we could inflate the 51 point talent to a ludicrous level without the bleed requirement and no PvP rogue would EVER, EVER take it. Even then, we maintained there is a number at which we would see rogues start to abandon their utility for more damage. (I don't honestly know if that is happening now though.)<br />
<br />
6) Some rogues are, understandably, not happy with this design. They want their PvE damage to not be so dependent on that one talent. They want HfB to be good in PvP. We understand why they feel that way, even if it isn't in the cards for 3.1. I suspect, as one player above posted, some are trying to use HfB in PvP out of spite. At this stage we don't think we'll see most Arena rogues go 51 Assassination. But you know what? If they want to give it a shot, go for it. We don't think it will be overpowered given what they have to sacrifice.<br />
<br />
7) Long-term, we'll have to see how it goes in the Arena this season. As I have offered before, rogues were originally designed to be the guys who surprise an enemy and beat them down before anyone knows what happens. That is certainly iconic for the rogue class in RPGs and other media. But it also just isn't much fun for the victim. We have been moving away the stealth -&gt; stunlock -&gt; 100% to 0% in a few GCDs phenomenon (which to be fair, is pretty wildly exaggerated in the first place). We have chilled out the CC and the burst. At this point we don't think we can chill it out much more without giving rogues more staying power to just sit in combat and melee (which we don't think they have a ton of right now). We can imagine a PvP rogue that stuns less and stands and fights more, but again that's a big change, and it's not in the cards for 3.1. If you think that kind of direction is interesting or terrible, we would love to get your feedback (though probably not in this specific thread).

<br />
They remove the 10% stun chance, because they want to remove RND from stuns, yet keep it for mages and its fine. Then they give shadow priests an ability on a 1 min coolodwn, which was nice, then they nerf it to 2 mins, then the let melee keep there offhand. THEN they nerf fear because of warlocks<br />
<br />
So basically, shadow priests are in a worse state than they were before. 2 min cooldown trick, fear breaks instantly. No 30% dmg reduction from PH, no fear anymore, no chance of escaping melee with black out, 2 min pony trick, which will see us dead in 7 seconds, 6 seconds of that from Dispersion, which is still shit.<br />

<br />
They remove the 10% stun chance, because they want to remove RND from stuns, yet keep it for mages and its fine. Then they give shadow priests an ability on a 1 min coolodwn, which was nice, then they nerf it to 2 mins, then the let melee keep there offhand. THEN they nerf fear because of warlocks<br />
<br />
So basically, shadow priests are in a worse state than they were before. 2 min cooldown trick, fear breaks instantly. No 30% dmg reduction from PH, no fear anymore, no chance of escaping melee with black out, 2 min pony trick, which will see us dead in 7 seconds, 6 seconds of that from Dispersion, which is still shit.<br />
<br />
GG blizz.<br />
<br />
<br />
first of all we are getting dispel protection (VT just like UA). also in case someone dispels our dots we receive like 20% mana back which is nice (don't know exact %). then you get INSTANT 40% dmg or so from DP - nice as well. THEN we're getting twice the armor we had in 3.0.9 = good vs melee. 15% magic damage reduce is also nice. Dispersion is reworked so you are immune to snares/stuns/cc. so please stop your crying. I don't like the recent changes about Psychic Horror too but we can't help it. and it's not that bad. Hopefully they will rework Mind Flay and SWD tho. you can read some suggestions here: http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=46617.0<br />

Fact is that you'll have to keep old gear just for the sake of an achievement, and if you're social you'll want to keep it after wards in case someone needs help with the achievement... Like most people don't have enough bank problems.<br />
<br />
It's not really an achievement if you out gear it. If you don't like it, don't do it, you'll have the 25 man version to flex your epeen. And you brought up that 25 man guilds already do 10 man achievements, did you ever think maybe they are trying to avoid that? See stuff isn't hard to understand if you actually think about it instead of turning on the water works.</div></div><hr />

Lay back on the exaggeration. VT is still nowhere near UA, the dmg is lower and there is no silence. The 15% base mana is nice but it still doesn't pay for the dots, as it shouldn't, besides you sound like you think we get 20% of total mana. The DP dmg is only 15% not 40, the armor is glyph'd, and the dispersion change is practically useless.</div></div><hr />

I personally doubt if there is a 25-man version, because as you say it seems to be something to promote people to do things with the appropriate gear... But I mean, couldn't they have done something like 9 people OR 10 people with 226 max ilevel? I personally like to get titles that will become unattailable in the future, I don't like anything else of achievements and if anything I feel it's a waste of time spend coding... Now you can bet your ass that this achievement will also be removed after a while, probably not until 4.0 because of the nature of the achievement, but the point is that it'll become unattainable...<br />
I will get it either way, but I dislike that my bank has to suffer because of it, and I don't think that's an unreasonable thing to be concerned about.</div></div><hr />

Er, DK's got nerfed this patch. If you weren't retarded that is, you would have noticed that the &quot;Icy Touch spam&quot; build (0/22/49) just got nerfed AGAIN, deep unholy gargoyle got nerfed AGAIN, and anyone that did over 50% of the DK's HP during an AMS in PVP is a complete moron. It's purely a PVE change so that you can't mitigate 1,000,000 magic damage during an AMS.<br />
<br />
Hooray for Icy Touch spam nerfs!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
According to Bornakk its a normal Achievement and not a Feat of Strength<br />
<br />
To try and clear up any confusion, the planned item level for the achievement in Ulduar 10 is item level 226. This level gear drops from both hard mode Ulduar 10 and regular boss kills in Ulduar 25. So yes, while players who clear Ulduar 25 will get more 226 gear at a faster pace and possibly get this achievement first, it's an achievement anybody can do, so when a guild that only runs normal Ulduar 10 progresses through the instance and gets the hard modes done, they will be ready to take on this achievement. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Ulduar 10man achievement is an achievement, not a Feat of Strength (if I hear of any changes to this, I will let you know). While yes, you can hang on to your gear for awhile longer if you plan to do the achievement multiple times, that is up to you.</div></div><hr />

I ask because referring to what Blizzard is doing to the Class in 3.1 is similar to referring to a 1989 Mazda 323 Hatchback as a Classic Car....It IS old after all......<br />
<br />
the Recent changes are to balance the Massive Over-Nerfing, including, but not limited to the complete removal of the damage dealing portion of one of our AoE abilities, Halving the Range of another one, Lets talk about the re-organization of the Frost Tree with the Sole Purpose of hosing one bothersome Hybrid Build and how it makes half the lower tier Talents Useless, or the reduction in Weak Impurity Scaling....<br />
<br />
Or Maybe you were referring to the Gargoyle buff, or Rather them giving the Max Duration back and doing what Should have been done in the First Place... Maybe by &quot;Buffing&quot; you are referring to the turning interesting cooldowns in to very mild Mitigation abilities, was that what you were referring to? I have it! It is the removal of the 25% miss chance from lichborne making it possibly useless!!! oh wait, IT GIVES A FROST DK 15 SECONDS OF FEAR IMMUNITY! WOOT!<br />
<br />
I am sad that Shadow Priests Damage is being so Nerfed, especially the Front Loaded DoT damage, but I have a Solution!!! <br />

Maybe add 50% healing reduction to that 50% slow for the DK's as well, hell while you're add it throw in a chance on mass disarm/dispell/stun (all at once) every time the dk presses the W,A,S,D key or click any spell. Let's make it even more pathetic while the warrior is whithering away on the back burner... <br />
<br />
By the way thanks for a 1.5 second (not on the move) castable spell + GCD for an almost 3 second cast o.O And of course a nerf to fury because 25 man buffs and a full fucking ragebar is the way the warrior looks all the time amirite? -Still waiting for the changes that will make warriors viable. Not that I'm holding my breath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sweet, so instead of being completely unkillable by magic damage, it now only requires you to take 1.75 times your total hp to get rid of the shell and kill you (within the 5 seconds that exists, of course).<br />
<br />
This is clearly a massive nerf and renders the game totally unplayable.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkAxius</div><div class="date">2009-03-31, 01:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, people with their pitchforks want to victimise the DK class for their crap PvP Season.<br />
<br />
It may come as a surprise to some people that the DK class is, while overpowered in some circumstances, still in need of serious tweakage; but even after this, do NOT expect to run up to a DK as your mage/shaman/whatever and expect to click 3 buttons to own him like you do to the Paladins/Warriors. It's a different class, it's being tweaked still, and it's not going to be 'business as usual'.<br />
<br />
As for Arena - if you balanced WoW around Arena 2v2 Matches (which REALLY should be removed from the ranked games in my opinion - 2v2 is as good as 1v1 with a healer for the most part and all people do is whine) then you'd wreck the game. 2v2 is an atrocious way of balancing any class and I hope stats to balance classes never come from that source.<br />
<br />
Rather than moan about a DK's abilities being buffed and how he's OP already, log on to Live and go talk to a DK about his class and learn exactly what these changes will do to him. Find out what situations he likes and dislikes, try to LEARN the class rather than realise your one-shot macro mysteriously doesn't work.<br />
<br />
It might seem a bit hostile, but I don't think people realise how much some of this nerfing of the DK class is going to render some tanks in some guilds MIA. I for one think these changes will greatly deter entry-level DK tanks now, and longer term tanks now have to cope with significant reduction to our Parry rating which is going to do nothing but harm to my tanking ability.<br />
Let me look at it this way - nowhere can I see changes on the PTR suggesting the 2 tank classes that weren't favoured for Sarth 3D are ANY more likely to be able to do it now, and it WAS the performance of the DK in Sarth3D that got people moaning about our tanking abilities, instead now we have no classes that can do it. That is just a tiny bit extreme.<br />
<br />
I can see patch 3.1.1 is going to end up reverting or altering some of these nerfs/buffs when Blizz finds out their great fixes don't quite work for entry-level to mid-level tanking.</div></div><hr />

When a warlock summons eye of kilrogg a bar appears (like aura's on dk/hunters/pallys) that has an option to summon the eye and cancel the channeling. The first button does nothing currently, and the second cancels the casting of course. No longer have to click the buff off to leave it early.<br />

I learned a long time ago that when there's only ONE way to obtain something, you should obtain as many of them as possible, because they might add something later that requires them. I have over 100 cooking awards rotting on my currency tab since I've been doing the cooking daily every single day since Wrath's release. I was a Chef the day 3.0.8 released, and I'll be Cooking with Style the day 3.1.x releases. :)<br />
<br />
Just gives you a reason to do the dailies for ~3 months. They're worth over 10g for less work than most of the other dailies (especially since you don't have travel time to Icecrown or wherever the other daily might be) to boot.</div></div><hr />

They are the guys that balanced SC2 and War3 with 30-50 of units, which was hell harder a job. But somehow they cant succeed in balancing 2v2 arenas. Anyway, experience with Blizzard previous way of balancing made me buy WoW in the first place, if they carry on screwing balance it will just prove that's not Blizzard i used to know, and no reason to play WoW. I think a lot of people will agree with me, so dont tell us to give up hopes about 2v2 balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I concede some of the tanking abilities ARE powerful, but if Blizzard bows to pressures in PvP they are going to overnerf because a lot of the tanking abilities are exactly what makes a DK in PvP powerful - there is a fine line there which Blizz can balance.<br />
<br />
As for 2v2 - you may like it, but it is exclusively my opinion that it should be removed from the ranked games. People may not agree, that's fine, but you can't balance 2v2 like you would Starcraft. 2v2, using Starcraft to compare, is the equivalent of a Marine and a Firebat fighting a Hydralisk and a Zergling and complaining that the Hydralisk tends to kill the Marine too fast. You might not like to hear it and you may dream of a world of balanced 2v2 but it's not likely to happen. 2v2 tends to turn into either two 1v1 matches or a 2v1 gankfest as it's a game to see who can take out whose partner first. From my experience, it's no different to 1v1 and I don't take part.</div></div><hr />

All throughout LK we have been trying to force players to choose offense vs. defense in PvP. Almost every time we have allowed players to us defenses in an offensive manner, we’ve had balance problems, and paladins and DKs are the poster children for that. If you want to do damage, go cat. If you are being focused on, go bear. Though the Primal Tenacity change is really hurting bear survivability more than cat though, so maybe I misunderstood your point.<br />
<br />
Play defense as Feral druid all the time in PvP and still win? ??? WFT? What game does GC play anyway?<br />
<br />
When will Blizz devs learn that separating talents between cat and bear in the same talent tree is just stupid design and just weakens the feral druid to much compared to other classes. <br />
<br />
It's like warrior having two stances of the same type. Normal battle stance one and improved battle stance, while most of warrior's worthwhile skills can only be used in improved one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why cant they make it like this:<br />
<br />
Lets say S5 ends on a thuesday, ppl get their points from the week before that. Play 10 games (or whatever) in the &quot;dead&quot; week between S5 end and S6 start. Next thuesday S6 start and Arena ratings will reset to 0, but still recieve points for the games played in the &quot;dead&quot; week. When a player would enter Arena after S6 has started his points will reset.<br />
I dont see why Blizzard doesnt give PVPers some time to complete a set in this horrible season where gear was extremly expensive. I know alot of ppl that are lacking points instead of rating. Ive been at 2k+ for over 6 weeks and still dont have my shoulders, helm or chest because i desperatly needed the weapons 1st.<br />
<br />
I cant inmagine how stupid this must be for ppl that didnt farm 1200 points a week. Now im gonna miss exactly 1 week of points to be 4/5 deadly set..</div></div><hr />

dks get a massive, classbreaking nerf:<br />
HAHA DKS GOT NERFED, FINALLY!11 GO BACK TO YOUR TERRIBLE MAINS AND L2P<br />
<br />
dks get a tiny boost to said nerf, making it balanced and usable again (but still a shadow of its former self):<br />
WOOOOOOOOW........... DKS GOT BUFFED SOOOOOOOO MUCH IN THIS PATCH LOOK AT MY CLASS WOW ONLY SEVERAL NEW COUNTER SPELLS, BOOSTED DAMAGE AND LOWERED COSTS TO MY ATTACKS THATS NOT ENOUGH TO FIGHT THE OP DK GG BLIZZ GG BLIZZ U FAIL AT BALANCE.<br />
<br />
really, fuck off. are you sure that dks are OP? or did you just forget to notice that EVERYBODY kicks your ass?<br />

like one a Paladin told Nerf Mages ... I never had chance to kill the Mage... ROFL.<br />
<br />
same @ DK: yeah like in calssic and starting BC the Warlock Buff attack from Blizzard.<br />
Class-Balance is good. but not in WOW.<br />
<br />
As u can see, at least 3 of 52vs2 Arena teams (between place 1-5) are Palas + DK<br />
<br />
So PLEASE BLIZZARD BUFF THEM a little bit more. Wen need that ALL Areana teams (2vs2) should be Pala &amp; DK !!!<br />
<br />
For Cloth wearing classes its nearly impossble. Maybe WL have an &quot;normal&quot; Chance with Pet. But Priests and Mages I dont think so. That was the reason whay i play more often my Druid &amp; Rogue.<br />
<br />
If you want some BUFFS and NERFS dont mix them up. Nerf the classes they should been nerfed and not the other way round. <br />

Nope, it just make them the same like others.<br />
<br />
Your comparision is poor. The way it was, it was like a Warrior could spec Prot and Fury at the same time. Now it's almost like any other class, you spec tank or dps.<br />
<br />
If they choose to revert back to one spec for both, then feral Druids should be directed as OT only class since they would have a stupid advantage over the other classes that can spec tank OR dps (as they used to have).<br />
<br />
Even with dual specs now, that would let druids have 3 specs (TANKDPS/other).</div></div><hr />

The best fix? 10 and 25 sharing lockouts. Done :) For realm's 1st only, of course. No reason to QQ about something that everyone can get.<br />

In the end of the day, this makes Blizzard look into the problem and adjust it. Somehow they havent fixed DKs yet, and yeah, people will whine. And stop making PvE excuses for DK opness in PVP. We know that every nerf affects Dk tanking, but it is too good and easymode anyway, nothing's wrong in bringing some balance to DK tanking as well. Come on, you learnt how to chain your defensive cd's and survive Sapphiron's breath? It shouldnt be simple as that, DK's immunities are OP at the moment and i dont see why we have to deal with them for so long.<br />
<br />
And 2v2 is most popular setup, you want to remove it? Try harder. Also this &quot;they cant balance it attitude&quot; shows how little you know about Blizzard.

I think a lot of people will agree with me, so dont tell us to give up hopes about 2v2 balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He doesn't have to. Blizzard always stated that their focus for balancing would never be 2v2 and if they could get rid of it, Arenas would be only 5v5. Anything lower than that (5) is like trying balance 1v1.</div></div><hr />

We have it, but is it good enough for it to be effective in PvP? Hell no.<br />
<br />
What's even worse is the fact that Rogues can come up with MULTIPLE ideas, good ones at that, that Blizzard could do to balance/fix Rogues, but they completely bypass it and don't even bother to tough up on it.<br />
<br />
If you have checked the Damage Dealing forums lately, there's a gigantic post in which Rogue issues are brought up and there are ALOT of great ideas and solutions Blizzard could use, yet there hasn't been a single response to that thread.<br />
<br />
It's truly sad that we, the players who pay their salary, have to endure this bullshit just because Blizzard can't balance a game properly. I understand there are variables and factors that you can't really get around, but if you're going to design such a massive game and expect millions to play it and coincide, then you should at least take the proper steps and balance out the game before you release, and same thing goes with everything else you introduce down the road.<br />
<br />
I would gladly wait longer for patches if you actually did the proper testing and research before releasing it. I don't know if anyone else notices it, but I truly believe Blizzard fucks with classes just so they can keep you playing the game. It's a simple, &quot;Ok, if we fuck this up, then people will reroll new classes. Not everyone will, but the majority will, so that way, they have more characters they have to maintain, as well as more time spent online and buying game time.&quot;<br />

first of all, i dont think it is SUPPOSE TO be FUN for the victim. what about palas doing the same to rogues? is it fun then ? <br />
and if you take it away from rogues, what else is there? crappy stun and low burst. so what, are we suppose to gently ask the victim not to move, because we would like to stab him/her some more? <br />
and why do they keep talking about assa all the time ? what about subtlety ?? what is the point of shadowdance if EVERYONE can escape any cheapshot , and even if i use it multiple times, it wont work cause of &quot;Diminishing returns&quot; and what is the point of ambushing targets while shadowdancing if the burst dmg is shit low. anyway by the time you lunch shadowdance &quot;the victim&quot; will be far away, blinked , shapeshifted, or bubbled away, leaving us with nothing but ticking cds.</div></div><hr />

I can't imagine though the argument against the person being that it is ok if it is not balanced because balance isn't needed. The reason (at least as i see it) we want balance is so they can make better PvE content. The hard modes (if classes are unbalanced) either require the stacking that blizzard claims they want to avoid or would be too easy when using a stacked raids.<br />
<br />
I also figure that due to the very strong death knight that had come out at the start of the expansion that until they are nerfed into non-competitiveness on all fronts many will not be happy.</div></div><hr />

top 100 -&gt; 6<br />
101-200 -&gt; 13<br />
201-300 -&gt; 6<br />
301-400 -&gt; 8<br />
401-500 -&gt; 10<br />
(and I am not even searching what were the previous classes from the teams that say &quot;Team Incomplete&quot; and I am counting them for the 500 so you at least have a minimum representation of (6+13+6+8+10) / 500 * 100 = 8.6% )<br />
SO YOU SIR ARE A COMPLETE DUMBASS! It is not 1% of druid representation, it is a minimum of 8.6% on top 500!!! that is WAY more then rogues representation 3% on top 500.<br />
<br />
edit: I just want to add that 6% of teams are pala/druid on SK-100... just so that you know something more about druids.</div></div><hr />

You want to top Dmg or Healing meters to satisfy you ego. Who cares about dmg in raids anyway, ive cleared naxx HC is with full lvl 70 pvp epics.<br />
<br />
Hard modes seldom allow for lowly geared or backwards performing people.<br />
<br />
I hope you do know that the only content that matter is the content that challenges you, and it is that content that need balancing. So, &lt;random boss&gt; in &lt;random raid&gt; doesn't matter. It never did matter. Ever. Even before the farse that is Arena entered the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First let's quote something : <br />
Herald of the Titans *New* - Defeat Algalon the Observer on Normal Difficulty without anyone in the raid wearing any equipment with an item level higher than 226. Title Reward: Herald of the Titans<br />
<br />
Okay so the way I see it, you need to kill every bosses in Ulduar 10mans with gear item lvl 226 MAX (including 226)... Well it's the easiest achivement ever, just keep the gear you have right now and you'll get it. You even earn a title. Not really something to be proud of. If you are conplaining about bank space, well come on, it's at most 17 items. Create an alt, buy new bags, but don'T complain.<br />
<br />
Then let's go back to a normal Feat of Strenght : Be the first guild to clear Ulduar 10mans.<br />
<br />
The problem the dev are enoncing with this achivement right now is that a 25 mans guild could get both (seems pretty hard for me, except if there is not much guild at the top of the server). <br />
<br />
Okay I admit they've got a point there. Solution : If you win an achivement, either 25mans first or 10 mans first, well you CAN'T get the other one. AS simple. that's it. It's solve.<br />
<br />
If there is anything I might have forget about the problem, well plz tell me. I'll try to find other ways to solve them.<br />
<br />
Now one last thing : Could anyone be kind enough to tell me how I can participate to those blue post. I would like to tell my idea to Bornakk, but I don't know how. If you could help me to contribute to our gaming society I would be grateful.&lt;<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and for your help ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its good I live nowhere near Blizzard HQ because I think I'd be slappin some people upside their fool heads.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ye agree, and this:'<br />
<br />
<br />
1) We like where Assassination rogues are in PvP. You can have excellent crowd control (Sure not bad, not too good but very nice idd), and decent burst (ye, if your a hardcore pve player and got 2x SR), survivability and mobility (... Clos for spell casters, ok but dang there goes my hopes for some changes we actually needed versus melee's). We think adding more damage on top of this would be too good (That is true, tho.. just make us more defensive.. let us all have imp sprint talent + nerves of steel at least), which is why we nerfed Mutilate in the first place.<br />
<br />
-- Lolert, well ill keep on dreaming and keep on rock'in since im out'a here anyway. Not hardcore enough for any serious buisness on my rogue.<br />
And seeing the way the class is going, im outa here.. since I only enjoyed it, and thats it. Yaman!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hordes næve</div><div class="date">2009-04-01, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Death Strike damage has been increased and now deals 75% weapon damage (up from 60%) plus 222.75 (up from 178.4) for the max Rank. <br />
<br />
<br />
if this is true, which i cannot believe it is, we are all doomed.<br />
<br />
this is probably the key ability to make Death knights very OP (along with the tons of selfbuffs they have)<br />
<br />
my lvl 78 DK can prolly get lucky enough to heal 5000 or more of he's health if i have Frost fever and Blood plague up on my target, but thats not all, i can do it twice! or even 3 times using Blood tap for another death rune.<br />
<br />
Thats OP mates... very OP ... and now it gets even better damage, that means the heal will prolly be around 6-7k next time i test it...<br />
<br />
let me remind you that that is just at lvl 78, with no epix or nothing...<br />
it is grotesque!!</div></div><hr />
