<br />
The next expansion will basically be the same story as the movie. Blizz believes that the wondrous movie will drive millions of viewers to play WoW and they will expect the same story. <br />
<br />
Sucks for those of us hoping for something different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. Absolutely no surprise that it was going to be Legion with how they said it was going to tie into this expansion before this expansion was even out. I honestly couldn't be less hyped about the expansion with how predictable it is. Another fail expansion in the making. <br />
<br />
More humans, another small worlds (6 zones), and more gimmick features that offer no real substance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New Honor System, which is probably the old Vanilla system :p<br />
<br />
Also looks like we'll be getting more class quests, which is probably linked to getting those artefact weapons</div></div><hr />

That's because it is. It's pretty much a complete continuation of WoD where WoD ends. Essentially, it's the second half of the expansion we should have gotten with WoD, but if we want it, we're going to have to pay for it in an all new expansion.<br />

Exactly. He pauses to get a reaction and it's just crickets.<br />

As long as it's better than WoD for non-raiders, I'll give it a shot. But this may be the first time I don't pre-order an expansion since WotLK.</div></div><hr />

Yep, I noticed that too. Adding in all the big name lore people that we haven't seen yet, the classes we expected, etc. Besides that, almost everything they've mentioned is a completely reused asset. Dalaran again, Valkyr again, Illidan and Gul'Dan again, Nestinwary again. <br />

By this I mean, they seem to be throwing in every possible major lore item or character, within the same expansion.<br />
<br />
That's exactly what it is. Absolutely everything they can throw at it and hope the players actually like the expansion. I seriously hope they just come out and say Legion is the last expansion and let this game age into obscurity afterwards.</div></div><hr />

&quot;OMG BC was the best expansion ever. They should do more of that. Burning Legion, please! We should have a demon hunter class! etc. etc. etc.&quot;<br />
Legion announced:<br />
&quot;lol, BC 2.0. Lame. Demon hunters? lawl More recycled content? I'm so done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Confirmed: There is no such thing as &quot;what the players want&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can't wait to play it. I'm still having lots of fun with the game and it'll be even better with fewer jaded fucks.<br />

No, actually, that was my point. Too often people--including those posting in this very thread--have said &quot;the players don't want THIS&quot; when what they really mean is &quot;I don't want this&quot;. I've been itching for another go at the Burning Legion ever since BC and I know I'm far from the only one, but in this thread and in other media it's full of comments from people claiming it's just &quot;recycled&quot; content, which is amusing and sad all at once.</div></div><hr />

You are. <br />
<br />
Alternate Gul'dan was thrown through big green portal at the end of Hellfire. He resurfaces in our world. Illidan might have died and was revived due to some lore we're not privy to yet, or he survived. This is all present time, on our world. There will be some 'flash backs' and such, but not really time travel like in WoD.</div></div><hr />

I'm not too bothered, I dislike having 2 dps specs on a class, since if one is better than the other by a large amount and you don't like that spec, it can get boring.<br />

But the flip side is that you lack a lot of the versatility and flexibility. For example I loved Arms and then they butchered Arms, so I went Fury. If Fury didn't exist I'd be SOL. Another example is doing a fight which Destro is terrible on, but Affliction is great at -- you can swap specs and keep yourself viable. Demon Hunters? Have none of those things. If you hate the Demon Hunter's single DPS spec you're screwed and can't play the class now. If that single DPS spec is terrible for a fight then you're screwed, you'll just have to suck because you can't change to something else.</div></div><hr />

Thing is, WoD never impressed me. Not even from the get-go. Legion looks like a mashup of everything people have been asking for for nearly a decade. All I need is to see a giant keg weapon for monk's tank spec and I may just re-sub.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, i kind of didn't get that much excitment from WoD...<br />
God, i wish i didn't get hyped but i am<br />
Can't wait to see more about this new expansion... hoping it'll have much more content than the filler expansion we're playing right now</div></div><hr />

Why does that disappoint you at all? Gameplay wise it's like custom weapons from ToR or exotics from Destiny. Plus unlockable skins makes them a step above those examples. It's basically EQ's epic weapons and something they only touched upon to great success in Vanilla. Is it because they aren't raid drops?</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Lore is simply out the window. Disregarded and many parts of what they are doing make zero sense lore-wise.<br />
- Legion seems like more of a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; or &quot;Best of&quot; collection. <br />
- I can see how they are getting it out early with so much in terms of zone design, npcs, weapons, etc. being taken from old zones. (Vykul for example)<br />
- I don't know where they go from here after Legion in terms of wow. It almost seems like the end of the road with so many major wow storylines being closed. Once the Legion is gone, what's next? It's always kind of been that the Legion was the great enemy. It's like defeating the Germans in a WW2 movie, after that...?<br />
<br />
One more thing, even from what little was shown it's clear Blizz hasn't learned their lesson from the Garrisons on the lack of customization. The artifact weapons are more skill &quot;lines&quot; with almost no choice than skill trees. 3 color choices for artifact weapons? Has Blizz played any other game in the last 10 years that use real palettes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also I guess we won't be seeing weapon drops throughout the expansion since we'll just have the one the entire time?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are disappointing because they are, from what we've seen, locked to classes and specializations. So Frost DKs? Are stuck with 1 hand weapons. Fire Mages? Stuck with a 1h sword. If you don't like the look, or for some classes the playstyle, of those weapons then you're just boned. I'm also really doubtful that they'll add enough customization options to make the weapons truly feel unique. It wouldn't be so bad if you could go back and collect other weapons later in the expansion if that was your desire, but without the talent trees on them.</div></div><hr />

For example I loved Arms and then they butchered Arms, so I went Fury. If Fury didn't exist I'd be SOL. Another example is doing a fight which Destro is terrible on, but Affliction is great at -- you can swap specs and keep yourself viable. Demon Hunters? Have none of those things. If you hate the Demon Hunter's single DPS spec you're screwed and can't play the class now. If that single DPS spec is terrible for a fight then you're screwed, you'll just have to suck because you can't change to something else.<br />
<br />
You mean like Retribution Paladins? Shadow Priests? Windwalker Monks? <br />
<br />
1 dps classes are fine. they are called hybrid classes incase you didn't know since you sound like you're a new player.</div></div><hr />

Those classes all have three specializations rather than two. 'We already have one DPS spec' isn't a valid reason to just say fuck it and call it quits at two when a number of classes in the game have THREE dps specs.</div></div><hr />

Get on with your life and play something else? Do you honestly expect Blizzard to maintain one game forever? It's been 11 years. Instead of dreading the end, welcome it. Make it the finale of a great adventure. If they kept making Breaking Bad episodes after Walter White died would they be any good?<br />
<br />
No? Alright then.<br />

A ranged spec that uses weapons like rifles and crossbows. Ya know, kinda like those other Demon Hunters...</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but where can we see a Demon Hunter using ranged weapons? I'm asking honestly, because i've only seen them using glaives.<br />
At least i don't remember seeing it in game</div></div><hr />

Really? What brought you to that conclusion? By all means, show some evidence that you're not just talking out of your ass with the quoted assertion. You're grasping at straws for no real reason. <br />

We've never seen them using ranged weapons in WoW, but we've also seen very few of them in terms of combat. Diablo however has a Demon Hunter class which is of similar lore that is entirely based around being a fluid, ranged powerhouse and Blizzard is far from shy about taking inspiration from their other titles.</div></div><hr />

You are the one talking out of your ass sir. Why the hell would they need a ranged spec? Or the game itself need another ranged spec?<br />
<br />
3 for hunters, one for druids, one for priests, 3 for mages 3 for warlocks, one for shaman.<br />
<br />
Vs.<br />
<br />
2 for warriors, 2 for DKs, one for shaman, 3 for rogues, one for monks, one for paladins, one for druids.<br />
<br />
12 vs. 11. If you want to include gladiator stance, 12 vs. 11.5. Ranged DPS is the archtype with the largest number of specs already to which to say they always have had the largest number. 3 melee deeps came from the added classes. Fuck that noise.</div></div><hr />

You try to make it sound as if there is some great disparity between the numbers when in reality, by your own count, there is only .5 ranged 'specs' more than there are melee. That number wouldn't even change if they had added a ranged spec for Demon Hunters. It'd just be 13 vs. 12.5. Not to mention the fact that only one class in the entire game uses ranged weapons. That's not even considering the fact that the last two classes that were added were BOTH entirely melee, apart from one healer spec. <br />
<br />
Like I said you're grasping at straws. There is literally no reason a ranged spec for Demon Hunters couldn't have worked just fine.</div></div><hr />

Only you've been comparing a D3 DH with a WC DH and they are not the same. One is a black-wearing emo Van Helsing wanna be the other drank demon blood and blindfolds themselves to see the 'truth'. If anything 3 D3 DH is a tinkerer, but let's not get into that can of worms lol.</div></div><hr />

Because as we all know, Blizzard never dips into their other franchises for ideas. It's not like the bones of the Demon Hunter is roughly identical for both universes, or that they've mixed and matched abilities/spells/class concepts between the two worlds for years. Ascetically the two are different, naturally, but demeanor wise, background wise and in terms of the general theme? They are quite similar. <br />
<br />
You could try and make a case for them being similar to Trinkerers, but then a lot of people have tried to make the case for Demon Hunters being similar to Rogues and Warlocks. Blizzard is creative when they want to be, they could have figured it out just fine. <br />
<br />
I think the biggest issue here is that you seem to be under the impression this is a big deal for me. I really don't care that much. Would it have been cool? Yes. Am I kinda disappointed it didn't come to fruition? Yes. But I'm not flailing and screaming 'UNSUB!!111' here. It's just my opinion on the matter, considering 2 specs instead of 3 is an oddity and this is a forum for discussing such things. Either way I'm excited to see more with what they'll do with the class. They said they wanted to focus the coolness into two specs, which I hope they do. If they manage that, give it some flexibility in terms of playstyle to make up for a lack of a third spec, then it'll be golden in my eyes.</div></div><hr />
