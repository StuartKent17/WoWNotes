Immersive Sounds of Azeroth Panel<br />
Near the end of the panel, the team mentioned that &quot;Lady Waycrest has offered tribute and is waiting for you to find a little musical surprise.&quot; This is a possible hint to a secret in game.<br />
<br />
<br />
The panel started out with David Arkenstone and a band playing Kul Tiran music.<br />
Music often provides emotional guideposts in a story and can act as an anchor in a story arc.<br />
David Rovin took over as sound supervisor for WoW a year ago. He says WoW has been a legend in the industry for some time.<br />
Sound design should:<br />
<br />
Make the player feel awesome by having their sounds be the loudest.<br />
Help the player play the game by having audio cues such as aggro sounds.<br />
Be immersive.<br />
<br />
Audio on screen that is not directly in front of you is lowered to help you focus on what is right there in front of you.<br />
Drustvar is a good example of sound design as work in game.<br />
David Rovin leads a team of 6 sound designers for WoW.<br />
Building an Ambience in 2004<br />
<br />
Avoid sounds that create a noticeable loop.<br />
Minimize disc space through sharing.<br />
<br />
WoW Ambience Today<br />
<br />
Simplified base layer.<br />
Variation through one-shot randomization.<br />
Content specific sounds.<br />
More personality.<br />
<br />
Drustvar purposely has some spooky sounds that are tied to the effigies in the trees.<br />
Every creature has an aggro sound, attack sounds, and a death sound.<br />
The team also adds creature ambient sounds to make them more alive.<br />
<br />
Idle vocalizations<br />
Iconic performance<br />
Distant flavor kits<br />
Weighs as much as a duck<br />
<br />
Drustvar witch drust magic purposely has its own sound effects that differ from player magic sounds.<br />
Certain areas in Drustvar purposely have different sounds, most of which are even creepier than the rest of the zone, such as the graveyard and throughout the Crimson Forest.<br />
Music has a similar role as sound design in setting up a narrative or tone of a zone.<br />
Abby Lewis Inspired Music of Drustvar.<br />
<br />
Child-like and mysterious.<br />
Classic horror, not jump scare.<br />
A sense of history, twisted fairy tale.<br />
Starting point, leaving room to develop.<br />
<br />
Fallhaven - Tension Builder<br />
<br />
Darker as you start to encounter bad things.<br />
Drawing on orchestra techniques to sell tension.<br />
<br />
Glenbrook Wood<br />
<br />
Strong melody introduced early.<br />
Reinforced though question experience leading to dungeon capper and central piece of the zone, Waycrest Manor.<br />
<br />
Waycrest Manor<br />
<br />
The pipe organ was used outside Waycrest Manor and the music becomes more muted.<br />
Inside, the music is stronger.<br />
Waycrest Manor was the most intense sound design that the team has ever created in WoW.<br />
The organ becomes a character in itself.<br />
It was interesting creating sound for a boss that had an actual organ involved in the fight.<br />
When you kill a witch in the dungeon, you can actually hear the music play a cord that sounds as if Lady Waycrest is slamming her hands on the keys in anger.<br />
Encounter logic for creature spawning is utilized in changing the music as well.<br />
Dynamic Boss Encounter<br />
<br />
Paying It All Off<br />
<br />
Music changes by phase<br />
Organ based spells<br />
Final visit to musical themes<br />
When Lady Waycrest joins the fight, the emitters turn off and the dungeon music raises. When she dies, the music ends for the dungeon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Diegetic Audio<br />
<br />
From &quot;wallpaper music&quot; to emanating in the world.<br />
Responsive to players' actions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady Waycrest has offered tribute and is waiting for you to find a little musical surprise.&quot; Possible hint at secret in game?<br />
There are some immersive sound changes coming to when you are mounted or on a flight path.<br />
<br />
<br />

This totally made my day.</div></div><hr />

Can't understand why they removed them to begin with. They were P E R F E C T. The new ones all sound the same, and somewhat like metallic-wooden farts. Not very uplifting.</div></div><hr />
