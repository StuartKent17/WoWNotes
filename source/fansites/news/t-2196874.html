Brawl - Arathi Blizzard<br />
One of the new PvP Brawls is active today, Arathi Blizzard! This brawl brings wintertime to Arathi Basin, reducing visibility and freezing part of the lake! <br />
<br />
<br />

Legion Assaults<br />
Legion Assaults will go live later today (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/849322657657106432)! You will need to earn Defender of the Broken Isles (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11544-defender-of-the-broken-isles) for Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11446-broken-isles-pathfinder-part-two).<br />
<br />
<br />
The invasion begins with a zone being under attack. The skybox, world quests, and the NPCs present are changed in some areas, similar to the pre-expansion invasions. <br />
The invasion quests are similar to the regular world quests, requiring you to kill NPCs and click objects.<br />
After completing all six invasion world quests, you have completed the Assault on Zone quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests?filter-patch=23436&amp;filter-daily=1&amp;filter-search=Assault), allowing you to move to the next stage.<br />
Next you are sent to a specific point in the zone to defeat more invaders, with some similar followup quests.<br />
After all of these quests are complete, there is a three player invasion scenario that sends you to the Legion ship in the sky.<br />
On the ship you defeat various NPCs before defeating the leader and taking down the ship. <br />
<br />

Edit: Looks like it does have a chance to drop gear/dauntless pieces. I had a pair of 865 shoulders drop, and a dauntless leggings token.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On PTR every world quest from invasion gave 100 (?) Nethershards. For 400 shards you can get 850+ gear, for 5000 - 880+ gear. Plus of course you can get it from stuff on Broken Shore. Gearing alt/new char is very easy now.</div></div><hr />

Reading through the reward offers (emotes, bits to make emotes flashy and badges? seriously?), the fact you have to go through another launcher to even play the games you purchase (or UPlay which most players despise) and knowing they won't be offering discounts on their purchases like most of their competitors do instantly puts you off. Seriously, what's going to stop people from doing what they usually do and checking if it's for sale on Steam or g2a and saying Kappa to Twitch? Not to mention the shady partner contract streamers have to sign up to in order to get their 5% of a purchase made whilst their channel was viewed (even this is questionable considering there isn't any mention of a notification being attributed to your stream making a sale apart from the usual payout). Also there's the point that if you don't opt into being a part of the scheme Twitch will still advertise the game for sale on your channel but not give you any revenue.</div></div><hr />

That is not even marketing/advertisement, it is more of a &quot;we are letting you know&quot; thing, like an update.</div></div><hr />
