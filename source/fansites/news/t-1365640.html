New Connected Realms Coming<br />
Realms (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlhGFxXGEsQadHQ0YjJZX2J0eml0RC1fUDJEbFdJWFE&amp;usp=sharing) are being connected faster now! Keep in mind that Bloodscalp, Maiev, and Boulderfist will make the first group of three realms.<br />
As a part of our ongoing Connected Realms implementation, we will be connecting additional pairs of realms as listed below. We don’t have a specific date yet on when these connections will occur, but we’ll provide another update once we do. Please be aware that as a part of the connection process realm times may change to match each other.<br />
<br />
Next Realm Connection Pairs:<br />
Balnazzar and Warsong<br />
Gurubashi and Aegwynn<br />
Dalvengyr and Dark Iron<br />
Garithos and Chromaggus<br />
Onyxia and Burning Blade<br />
Maiev and Bloodscalp<br />
<br />
<br />
We're currently evaluating further realm connections and will provide updates as they're available.<br />
<br />
For more information on Connected Realms, please read the preview blog post here.<br />
<br />
Maiev, and...Bloodscalp?<br />
You MIGHT want to clarify that it is US Bloodscalp, and Not the EU one. Might confuse some people. <br />
All of the connections announced on the North American forums are for North American realms.<br />

Flex Mechanics Scaling<br />
Thanks for some excellent feedback so far. Boss mechanics inevitably involve some breakpoints (alas, there's no way for Malkorok to create precisely 3.7 Implosions), and they do need to scale in some form, or abilities only targeting maybe 2 players out of a 25-player Flex raid would make some of those mechanics feel completely trivial and detract from the intended experience and tuning. In general, we try to err on the side of rounding down, and making sure that the ratios are never worse for any group size than they would be for a normal 10- or 25-player raid. Norushen orbs are a great example of a place where that logic doesn't quite work, though, since you actually want more orbs, and not fewer. That's something we can adjust.<br />
<br />
Personally we have found 11 to be just about the hardest number. The difference in scaling between 10 to 11 is about 11mill HP. Now for a boss like the Iron Juggernaut, that’s fine. You pew pew the boss the whole fight. 11 mill over 5-6 mins is do-able. But, for a fight like Galakras where the boss is a burn at the end. That 11 mill is pretty tuff to make. Especially being flex so the extra members are not exceptional.<br />
<br />
TL;DR the boss HP Scaling is a bit over tuned for 1-2 extra players. (on some fights)<br />
A bit of clarification here: Boss health and damage scaling are both completely linear and proportional to group size, but scale up more slowly than raid size does. So, all else being equal, if you add players who are roughly on par with the average gear/skill of your current group, you'll have a slightly easier time as a result. <br />
<br />
Thok, for example, has 355 million health with a 10-player Flexible raid. If you add an 11th player, his health will go up to 390 million. I.e., you've increased your raid's damage output by somewhere between 14 and 20% depending on how many healers you were running, but the boss's health only went up by 10%. Adding that 11th player will also make Thok melee for about 3% more damage, which will barely be noticeable.<br />
<br />
Wait, what? He has like 440 million on 10 normal.<br />
Whoops, sorry about that. I was looking at the LFR numbers. He has 355 million with 10-player Flex, and 390 million with 11 players. Same general point holds, but I goofed on the exact values.<br />

That might explain why adds were dying a bit faster than I remembered (although we still have coordination issues, too bad they can't hotfix that).</div></div><hr />

Character is calculated by using all characters, Player is calculated using only the highest item level character per account.</div></div><hr />

So we can conclude that people on Mal'Ganis have better geared alts, while on Area 52 they have better geared mains. (assuming overall population is similar)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Area 52 has an avg player ilvl of 512 while MG is only 506.8. Area 52 has an avg character ilvl of 503.5 while MG is only 497.7. <br />
<br />
That is why I was looking at distributions, to see if the avg was misleading. Area 52 apparently has lots of Timeless Isle and ToT geared alts (and more alts in general). <br />
<br />
All the realms are listed in that spreadsheet I sneakily linked in the news. I wouldn't draw any real conclusions from the data until I have more confidence that I have a very complete data set though, which is why I didn't make it more a more obvious link. There might be lots of lower geared guilds I haven't come across yet on Area 52!</div></div><hr />

I'm wondering because this isn't the first set of LFR buffs, and whilst it can be needed due to the very nature of LFR, it also makes me wonder how its going to effect tactics on entering Flex, if they make it a total face roll some people may think &quot;Well it got out-healed in lfr i'll be fine&quot; etc etc etc.<br />

Funny, wonder why we can't pay the sub with a delay as well.... Company home town is irrelevant. I can understand why it is easier to roll out those changes on a set of servers in a particular country first, and not spread your workload across the world - that said, the head office location is completely irrelevant and it's a matter of choice, not a given. Lastly, a little respect for all your paying clients goes a long way, and a simple courtesy explanation would do the trick. But manners are hard to come by on top of the chain in Acti Blizz.</div></div><hr />

Now imagine that happens with in my absolutely dead realmpool(which actually consists of 2 realmpools!) where all 20 or so realms together don't make one decent realm.

<br />
No surprises there, for anyone.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is based in the US and only has support offices in Europe. It's basic logistics. They are of course going to get all the kinks worked out of the procedures needed to do things like server mergers on their native US realms before they stick a bunch of IT guys on an 11 hour flight to work on the EU servers.<br />
US servers are being done first, but in a trickle. When they get everything worked out then you'll likely see them do EU servers in one big push.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully they're going to add additional servers, but it makes me wonder, wouldn't it better to link a low/dead with a medium and give it some time to see where things go from there?</div></div><hr />

They were looking into this issue. Has anyone heard if this is still a problem at this point?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

The last connection with Bloodscalp worked alright, and we saw a few more people around... but it's not enough. Like people said, connecting dead realms to dead realms only solves part of the problem. We need a healthy realm to latch onto, please!</div></div><hr />
