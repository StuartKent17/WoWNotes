* Players can no longer become saved to a raid instance when they aren’t in the raid during a boss kill.<br />
<br />
This sounds like you will only be bound to an instance at the time of a bosses death...is that how others read it?<br />
<br />
Or is it saying, if you are in a raid group but not in the instance, if the raid kills a boss you were previously being saved to that instance but they have fixed that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hardly, but then I bet you don't care about facts and just blindly QQ. Conflag is staying about where it is currently, they just changed talents instead of conflag. Also warlocks can only conflag once per immolate with the glyph of conflag change only increasing damage by 10% for 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
Pretty big changes for destro, good thing I'm liking affliction currently. Destro is turning from interesting rotations, to spam more Incinerate.</div></div><hr />

I think it means if the raid kicks you just before killing the boss, you won't get saved.</div></div><hr />

with the new conflagrate glyph ... they want us to use it with 5 sec left ... which means 5% extra crit chance with this spell if we had fire and brimstone .... but it is alrdy nerfed to 12 sec of immolate (down from 15 sec)plus we don't have 15% increased immolate spell dmg from fire and brimstone .... one good thing is that after using it we gain 10% increased dmg from destruction which means 10% increased immolate spell power but still 5% reduction from the original fire and brimstone</div></div><hr />

I figure it was added to address things such as VoA PuGs.<br />
<br />
If your group kills Archavon and then some people say, &quot;We don't have the DPS, so I'm not wasting my time with Emalon&quot;, and people drop group and new people are invited in their place ... these new people are not saved to VoA unless they can actually down Emalon.<br />
<br />
No more walking into portal with, &quot;You will be saved to this raid in X seconds [ Accept ] [ Leave ]&quot; (or what ever that warning is, I forget the exact wording). Now you can join an Emalon attempt without being saved even if the PuG downed Archavon before your arrival.</div></div><hr />

I seriously doubt they would make such a drastic change to how instance locking works such as this.<br />
<br />
To me, the patch quote says that they fixed a bug where if you were in a raid and sitting outside the instance while your raid killed a boss, you wouldn't get saved while you were sitting outside.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, that's not what it's fixing at all.<br />
<br />
It's fixing you getting booted from the raid and still being in the zone when the boss is engaged. Previously, when this happens, you are then saved to the instance (even if you leave) if they down the boss on that attempt.<br />
<br />
I've seen terribles screwed out of joining another pug because of that (and retards who don't realize they got saved trying to join new ones).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The change(nerf) to Penance(Glyph)/Soul warding is really weird. As of right now, I'm pulling WAY much healing in Holy then in Disc. And now the change to Divine Hymn. At first you would say right it's normal. No spell can do 150k (almost 200K) in 8 seconds. But when you think about it, isn't Army of Dead OP? Isn't Heroism OP? Divine Hymn is a 10 minuts cooldown spell. It needs to be strong, really strong. And it was perfect. You were able to keep 12 people alive while casting it. Now, well you can wonder if it's still worth casting since it's a channeling spell. Frankly I would love hearing the reasons behind this nerf. At least reduce the cooldown, something? Or change the spell again. Anyway, nerf without other purpose than nerfing because big numbers. :S</div></div><hr />

<br />
The change(nerf) to Penance(Glyph)/Soul warding is really weird. As of right now, I'm pulling WAY much healing in Holy then in Disc. And now the change to Divine Hymn. At first you would say right it's normal. No spell can do 150k (almost 200K) in 8 seconds. But when you think about it, isn't Army of Dead OP? Isn't Heroism OP? Divine Hymn is a 10 minuts cooldown spell. It needs to be strong, really strong. And it was perfect. You were able to keep 12 people alive while casting it.

<br />
<br />
The only way to compare healing between Holy and Disc is with meters and no meter takes Shields into account (some can guess but it is still a guess).<br />
<br />
The nerfs to priest were needed for balance. I like the small steps they are taking to try and balance priests in PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are a priest and having a rogue open up on you, you have to ask yourself one question.. What is the rest of your team doing letting the rogue on you 1 v 1?<br />
<br />
You have a team for a reason, no fight is balanced on 1v1.. rogues just happen to have an advantage against most classes when it is 1v1.<br />
<br />
I don't pvp much anymore simply because of this sort of QQ.. This is the same level of QQ that brought about the whole fiasco that was AV &quot;balancing&quot; in TBC.<br />
<br />
The majority of people who whine about other classes simply don't know how to play against them, usually because you don't see the ones that know what they're talking about crying in this manner... only idiots who jump on the bandwagon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That sentiment only comes out when they become popular (Case in point: Nether Protection, which got nerfed 'cuz it's popular now). I think, though, it's more priests than rogues themselves that are causing the issues. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong: I have my fair share of rogue hate and I just get all warm 'n fuzzy seeing them nerfed as much as anyone else. I just think the amount of QQ over them this time is uncalled for. This time.</div></div><hr />

Its manageable, myself as a ret pally i like PvP more, gladly to dual specc aswell i'm able to play arena without paying 1-2k a week for respeccing, thats sweet.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the only class i wanna get away from is a warlock :P now with warrs able to remove bubble, in 3v3 u will always find some1 to remove it, thats a bugger for me, anyways its hard to balance 9 classes with 3 speccs each, so for now it's going fine. I'm happy how it is now, and lets hope blizz improves that gear manager :D.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed. If it would also get its cooldown halfed to what it had before the change from hot+cc, it would be ok. But just nerfing the heals without lowering the cooldown is just silly. Heroism/Bloodlust and Army of the Dead are really good comparisions. Both 10 min cds (aotd only skilled though) and incredibly powerful - BL/Heroism to the level of &quot;we're canceling the raid because we have no shaman&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder what the Innervate changes will be like; as a Hunter, it sounds fantastic, but as a Priest, it seems worrisome...<br />
<br />
<br />
Will thus regenerate 15732 mana on whoever the druid uses it on.<br />
<br />
Glyphed it will regenerate: 18878 mana for the druid.<br />
<br />
Or 2941 mana if used on someone else.<br />
<br />
The result being the total mana regained is almost exactly the same no matter whether you cast it on yourself or someone else (you loose out overall ~204 mana by casting it on someone else rather than yourself). <br />
<br />
<br />
~edit~<br />
<br />
Thus the glyph adds:<br />
<br />
<br />
~44mp5 - if your using innervate on yourself every cooldown.<br />
~41mp5 - if your using innervate on another player every cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also just to point out the obvious, basic maths says well geared priests and druids may loose out slightly, however now that you can innervate your shaman and paladins to equal effect i would say that that more than makes up for it within a raid setting.</div></div><hr />

How can you think one second i don't know about shiled not being taking into consideration by meters. I know how to calculate the number of shields I cast and how many healing it would have give me. The point is, I'm doing better in Holy. And I think most of us are, or will be now. <br />
<br />
And what balance are you talking about? Balance between Disc and Holy when Disc is probably not as good as Holy and they nerf Disc ? Or balance between priests and other classes when priests go oom, before shamans and pallys are half mana?<br />

as posted before there are so many specs that it will never be possible to get the game balanced in 1v1.<br />
<br />
and for sure rogues and Wls have lost their op status they had in vanilla. but still rogues are one of those classes that will always find a team to play highrated with (RMP). and if it doesnt work out admit that ur more skilled in pve *cough*.<br />
