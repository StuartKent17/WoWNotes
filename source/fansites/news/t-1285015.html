Patch 5.3 - Transmogrify From Bank and Void Storage<br />
Patch 5.3 adds the ability to transmogrify to items that are located in your bank or Void Storage without having them in your bags! The last update we got on Void Storage space was a no to more slots (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296428985779376128).<br />

<br />
<br />
Addon - VoidTransmog<br />
The ability to transmogrify from your Void Storage is already live, but not built in to the default UI. The VoidTransmog (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/voidtransmog) addon allows you to transmogrify to anything currently in your Void Storage. <br />
<br />
You can open the Void Storage window when at a transmogrification NPC (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs?filter-utility=64) by pressing the Void button on the transmogrify window, then selecting an item from Void Storage and applying it to the correct slot. The items don't appear in the normal flyout selection menu, so you must select the item and then slot. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Reputation / Questing<br />
Any plans to allow players to complete dailies and other quests while in a raid group? Current design is annoying.<br />
We would like too, yes. We just don't want to splash credit to the whole raid. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314437038625669120))<br />
This isn't rocket science. Group credit applies only to group even while in raid. Problem solved! Why so hard to understand?<br />
1) We'd like for groups in raids to go away. 2) Easy to understand and easy to implement are not the same. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/317308983054573568))<br />
<br />
So does this mean we can expect 2x10^10 dailies in every expansion from now on? and have those dailies gate everything?<br />
Have you played 5.2? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319518374591873025))<br />
But why is every major patch &quot;New dailies hub and...&quot; but no dungeons. Seems like lack of creativity.<br />
Production-wise, dungeons don't compete with quests or scenarios. Dungeons compete with raids. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319572036953440256))<br />
<br />
In vanilla, questing was what you did sub-level cap. Raiding level cap. Completely different now. Better? Unsure<br />
In vanilla, you did questing. Then a tiny percentage of players also did raiding. Now most player raid (at least LFR). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319222980045594624))<br />
Doesn't stop repetitive content from being repetitive.<br />
I agree. All content gets repetitive. It's impossible to design content faster than players can consume it. Hence, repetition. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319242840490270720))<br />
<br />
can we have some more uses for Lesser Charms? I think I have approximately a zillion of them.<br />
The use is intended to be that you can take a vacation on dailies if you so choose. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318891832266354688))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Essentially, we want WoW to feel more like fine dining and less like fast food. Please donâ€™t take this simple analogy to ridiculous lengths. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319895839453618176))<br />
What about aiming to be a food truck? High end trucks can be a great mixture of convenience, taste, and atmosphere.<br />
Love them, but they aren't that convenient. Here in OC the lines are always long. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319908599809835008))<br />
<br />
But sometimes, you don't have time for fine dining. you want a quick bite so you can do more important stuff afterwards.<br />
And you can play WoW in very small chunks. You just can't achieve every reward in small chunks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319908021826371584))<br />
<br />
the busy working person rarely has time for a fine dining meal though. Perhaps allow that person the ability to succeed<br />
We try to solve that by letting you accomplish something even in very small chunks. You just can't accomplish everything then. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319905146240913409))<br />
<br />
soooooo are we getting giant talent trees again since this new talent system is like fast food <br />
I'd argue the opposite. The older trees had a lot of empty calories. The newer ones are like tapas - small with depth. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319907830167658497))<br />
<br />
Fine dining is more about the experience. You spend a little time there. You soak it in. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319895762869837824))<br />
In the case of alts though (re flightpaths) the same great meal gets boring and bland after having it over and over again.<br />
I agree, but I'll refer to my comments last week: if your alt is so caught up that you don't need to play it, what's the point? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319903147952832512))<br />
<br />
How about making wow more like an amusement park, where there's a little bit of everything &amp; you CHOOSE what you want to do?<br />
In WoW, players tend to just pick whatever has the shortest line, not what is the most fun (and then get grumpy about that fact). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319902641071194113))<br />
<br />
Don't let people's hate over certain features bother you too much. No one is holding a gun to their head and making them play.<br />
It doesn't bother us. We just like to understand the feedback and in turn try and explain a bit why things were designed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319908444939378688))<br />
We'll support playing the game almost any way you want. We won't guarantee that your preferred way is the most efficient way though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319908260100579328))<br />
<br />
Why are hotfixes often implemented before being announced seems like it would confuse players<br />
Getting a hotfix applied takes a lot of people. Making an announcement takes a lot of different people (in different time zones). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318074646153011200))<br />
Sometimes we'd rather get the fix out ASAP even if the message lags behind. Not ideal though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318074735399415808))<br />
<br />
wondering, what would you say are the top 2-3 changes to the SDLC that have led to increased patch delivery?<br />
Better planning. More realistic schedules. More people (it's hard to hire enough good folks, but we're getting there.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/317433991840010240))<br />
<br />
I think &quot;overly literal&quot; is the better way to describe &quot;too rational&quot;, imo.<br />
Perhaps. It's this strange perception that if we get caught in a gotcha that we'll be forced to make a change. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319931988238819328))<br />
<br />
What mistakes? Mists has been a blast. My only complaint is I don't have time to do everything.<br />
Here are a few at launch: G Lotus felt too mandatory. Progression / rewards at 90 were not clear. PvP balance needed much work. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319241406885539840))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/april/ssdgraph.gif) seem to have bottomed out for now, with almost all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. No new CPUs, GPUs, or SSDs worth waiting for are expected before late in the second quarter this year. RAM prices have been increasing for the past few months, so if you were thinking about adding RAM anytime soon, now is the time.<br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 3770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Personally I don't see &quot;unicorn&quot; as a big epic gaming rig,.. rather a gay white horse with a carrot on it's head.<br />

Hate to be so critical, but the fact that he says take a vacation from doing dailies seems to imply that dailies are in fact a chore/job, otherwise we wouldn't need/want to take a vacation in the first place.

Out of interest what did you prefer about the &quot;Isle of Quel'Danas&quot; dailies compared to the &quot;Isle Of Thunder&quot; dailies.<br />
<br />
The Dailies in the Isle Of Thunder are much more varied (there is a much bigger pool of them) and there are a lot of fun ones, I really like the final one in the stage just opened for example.<br />
<br />
I really like the sense of progression as we go from stage to stage slowly taking over the isle.<br />
<br />
There is loads to do on the isle as well as the dailies (summons, rare hunting, treasure trove etc etc).<br />
<br />
The world PvP seems pretty active even on my carebear server (especially with people doing the PvP dailies).</div></div><hr />

We we're told before it was because of storage and data issues, now we are being told it was because they don't want us hoarding. These are two very separate things and I think they should just give us a straight answer. I get they don't want us to hold onto everything, but realistically void storage came off to me as a temporary fix to an issue they should resolve in a different way. If we have transmog I don't see why they can't make an interface that lets us learn skins akin to DCUO. The way we have an actual storage doesn't make sense to me when we don't have to actually use the items like you would in RIFT for example.<br />
In rift you equip them into vanity slots. In wow we are already just changing skins when we transmog, why not just make a skin storage book and let us hold on to whatever one we want. Easier to call to a list of skins than it is to actual create storage areas to hold items that you can place and retrieve.</div></div><hr />

Hit the nail on the head. Good catch. I've never once wanted to take a break from Raiding (though to be honest, I've met people who did), and daily dungeons aren't a big deal, and I can do random BG all day (if I'm not on a losing streak). But there's only so much repetitive daily questing I can take.<br />

I would love a storage book option, but in Blizzard's defense you're thinking about &quot;space&quot; in a physical way. With void storage they only need to track 80 item ID's. With a storage book, they would need to track every single armor in the game, along with a toggle value of whether the player is eligible to transmog that item. In terms of data storage, tracking all the items a person has access to would be much larger.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but you're wrong. Those are the same issue. They don't want us hoarding because every item we hoard is more data to store. Void storage is interesting because it strips all the &quot;extra&quot; stuff like gems and enchants off things, storing stuff only as it's basic item ID, making the storage more compact in terms of data efficiency. And in the end, that's all you need for transmog stuff, basic item ID so you can change the appearance of something.</div></div><hr />

You can use it from your bank as well, so no need. It's there purely for more space.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now we just need more space in the Void Storage! I filled mine up on Day One.<br />
<br />

Blizzard keeps saying no more VS. Well at the very least they should make all vanity items BoA so I can at least mule some of my stuff.<br />

Can't win, can they? They say they're not a chore, people complain. They acknowledge that they can be a chore, people complain.<br />
<br />
Personally I finished all my reps months ago... Golden Lotus took too long and the gating was a pain, other than that it's fine once you're over the hump. The 5.1 dailies were nice, the story chain kept you interested. And there's so much going on in IoT that I barely notice the daily grind. In fact I'm not sure why I'm still doing them other than that they're so easy... and I'm after that 10k daily achi lol...</div></div><hr />

Seriousy? Why would you be taking items in and out that often? Void storage isn't for things you're using. Your current xmog shouldn't be in there.<br />

<br />
Database space isn't the issue. If it was we wouldn't have 500+ pets, hundreds of mounts or the ability to have thousands of items in the mail. They can't keep putting off fixing the lack of storage caused by 'toys', tabards, holiday items, momentos and xmog that needs more space every tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Dailies in the Isle Of Thunder are much more varied (there is a much bigger pool of them) and there are a lot of fun ones, I really like the final one in the stage just opened for example.<br />
<br />
I really like the sense of progression as we go from stage to stage slowly taking over the isle.<br />
<br />
There is loads to do on the isle as well as the dailies (summons, rare hunting, treasure trove etc etc).<br />
<br />
The world PvP seems pretty active even on my carebear server (especially with people doing the PvP dailies).<br />
<br />
Well tbh, I can't really pinpoint the main things that made Isle of Quel'Danas more fun or w/e, it was a mixture of different elements that just made the experience very fun and unique. The daily quests didn't feel like a chore, and it might also be because I liked PvP back then much better than I do now, now a days PvP is all about prevention, there are less cases where you go tit for tat against other classes since some classes just too easily wreck other classes with their stuns/silences/etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, tho I don't see the problem in the silences and stuns(aside from rogue who has more or less a stunlock these days again...which is something I thought long gone since classic)...I think the 150k snares and immunity-bubbles and vanishes are much more annoying. Today it doesn't seem to be about who hits best...but about who avoids best(and thanks to snares avoiding has nothing to do with running away...at least not if you hit on any of those non-stop snare classes).</div></div><hr />

I like the new dailies because they are varied, but they are much more spread out than in the past, it takes much longer to complete everything. Also, back then it didn't feel as mandatory to do them every day, but now you still need to complete dailies to obtain charms.</div></div><hr />

Except... you can't put BoP(transmog) gear in a guild bank.<br />
<br />
People aren't complaining about space for BoE/unbound stuff; you can even just bounce that around in the mail if you so feel the urge.<br />

I don't know how practical it would be, but if the game's quests were repeatable -- not for gold, not for experience or vendor loot, but for a non-sellable clone of the original gear -- my space issues would be a lot less pressing.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I kind of get the same &quot;felling&quot;.<br />
<br />
I really enjoy MoP (certainly compared to 4.3) and I think the raids have been very good, and I really like the story telling in 5.1 &amp; 5.2 (I think the 5.1 faction quests where amazing).<br />
<br />
But I do have this underling Jaded felling, but I have been playing wow for over 8 years, and the very nature of every single MMO is repeated content (quests, raids, dungeons etc etc then all over again with alts over again).<br />
<br />
I do honestly think WoW is decreasing in popularity, but I do think the general MMO is market is I think a lot of people are done with &quot;the grind&quot;.<br />
<br />
I do also honestly think that MoP contains some of the best content blizzard have ever released.<br />
<br />
Who know where it will all end!</div></div><hr />
