Bug - Huge DPS Buff <br />
To clarify, we're not just looking for any case where you see big numbers. There are situations in encounters that buff you quite a bit. We are looking for a specific bug almost certainly related to the Essence of Gossamer (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37220) trinket where someone's dps is suddenly tremendously higher than the rest of the group for no apparent reason.<br />
<br />
Like I said, it's probably fixed already, but you can never be too sure. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13275298048-gc-11k-dps-as-feral-on-patchwerk-explain.html))<br />

Password problem on PTR<br />
We implemented some fixes overnight and we believe this issue is now resolved. Please re-test. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/7313171378-blue-password-problem-on-ptr.html))<br />
<br />
Talent builds in PvP<br />
I understand your point, but we actually do ask players to choose between more damage or healing and survivability. It is supposed to be an interesting decision. When you really want a talent because it is really useful for PvP and that prevents you from getting another talent that you also ideally want, you can argue that means the talent trees are actually working. One of the things I like about PvP specs is they do place a lot more emphasis on hybrid builds in order to pick up certain talents, while a great many PvE specs choose one tree and try to max it out.<br />
<br />
I am probably taking the mob example far beyond what you intended, but I think it is actually illustrative. You are going to defeat, by a huge order of magnitude, most of the mobs you meet. In many examples it won't even be a challenge -- you will two shot them. If the PvP matchmaking is working well, however, you will lose 50% of every match (and that assumes classes are perfectly balanced, which I won't pretend to claim). It is much harder to feel like a hero in an Arena because we aren't trying to make you feel like a hero. Psychologically, I think that is a bigger deal than a lot of players realize.

Divine Aegis clarifications<br />
You guys have poked holes in some of the extreme examples that have been mentioned, and understandably so, but this essentially is the gist of it. Players are really good at finding clever ways to exloit mechanics to trivialize encounters. Healing damage is a pretty well understood mechanic at this point. Shielding players from taking damage is a little scarier -- preventing 2x damage is a much bigger deal than healing 2x damage.<br />
<br />
While we probably could come up with a system that bullet proofed every possible potential Diving Aegis exploit, I just don't know that the bang for the buck is there. Even if you have 3-4 Disc priests healing a raid, it seems like they could all be pretty effective even with a limitation of one shield per target.<br />
<br />
If we get to the point where it feels like the third or fourth Disc priest is being excluded from a raid or an Arena team, we'll probably look into it some more. For now, we just want to see Disc be more common in general. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13909401951-divine-aegis-nerf.html))<br />
<br />
PvP survavibility<br />
First, I think the warlocks would disagree pretty vehemently about their survivability. This message comes up pretty regularly on the damage forums.<br />
<br />
Second, we know it's posible to make very tough priests, because Disc priests were exactly like that in later seasons. It took a high amount of resilience gear and some specific talent choices, but they could take a lot of damage and heal themselves through a certain amount of it.<br />
<br />
I agree we have some work to do on Holy priests in PvP.<br />
<br />
I think the concept of a cloth class without a lot of mobiliy that is supposed to just heal itself through damage would be a pretty hard sell. But we try to address it on the mitigation side for priests (and the occasional fear bomb doesn't hurt).

Clarifications on the &quot;DR&quot; from the latest Q&amp;A post<br />
My bad. You said &quot;DR&quot; and I even responded &quot;DR&quot; but what I meant wasn't diminishing returns, but breaking on damage (as fear does now). That is a topic that comes up a lot. My point was that it wouldn't make a big difference on very short stuns like Charge, but it would change being stunlocked quite a bit.<br />
<br />
To answer several other questions, yes I realize the questions were directed at PvP. The poster even said that up front. I mentioned Fury pulling aggro because it suggests their damage may also be pretty RNG if they can't control it better.<br />
<br />
RNG in PvP is a pretty big topic. In general you will probably find us more tolerant of random elements than players typically are. Misses, crits and resists are all very random and sometimes those numbers can determine success or failure of a match. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13908721775-concise-questions-seeking-answers-warrior.html))<br />
<br />
Sudden Death and Taste for Blood randomness<br />
No, I think I understood the issue in this case (which isn't easy, since so many of these questions are typically written in &quot;gotcha&quot; format). We did want them to be random abilities. It would have been very easy to make them on-demand, but we have also had to nerf a lot of on-demand burst (just ask the Ret pallies). In your mind you are probably envisioning a Sudden Death that does what it does now when you want it to. But in our minds, if we made the ability less random we would also make it hit less hard. That might be a fine trade-off for some warriors. We have discussed making Sudden Death more like mini-Executes. The reason we haven't done that yet is it just waters down the ability. Players might start to think, eh, it's not a ton more damage than MS, so I'll just stick with MS. It is really easy for players to match out abilities when randomness is downplayed. <br />
<br />
Stance penalties<br />
I think in the minds of most warriors they say &quot;Would I like to have a 10% percent damage penalty or not? I think not.&quot;<br />
<br />
But of course that's not the way it would work. If we redesigned the stances it wouldn't be in order to give warriors 3% more crit and 10% more health. That's just a straight buff. What we would likely do is something similar to the death knight presences -- lower your health by 10% and then increase the damage reduction of Defensive Stance and give Battle Stance a tiny bit of damage reduction. (Or maybe Battle Stance would take the same damage as Berserk, but have a more meaningful bonus like movement speed or attack speed). Now your tooltips don't use the word &quot;penalty&quot; so you maybe feel better about them, but the balance hasn't really changed much -- Berserk would be an offensive stance and Defensive would be a defensive stance. Being in Berserk would still be risky.<br />
<br />
If instead you're just arguing that warriors are weak and need to be buffed, that's a different issue. But there is no reason we would have to solve that by removing stance penalties. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13908721775-concise-questions-seeking-answers-warrior.html))<br />

The Craft of War: BLIND @ Warcraftmovies (http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=97157)<br />
<br />
A few words from the author, Percula<br />
Earlier this year I got pretty bored and decided to do something creative in my spare time. I've been wanting to do a fight scene for a while and decided to develop a story with World of Warcraft. There are some great machinimas created by fans and at one point I thought about making a machinima as well but animation is what I do and I decided to use my skills in making something.<br />
<br />
My thought is to make The Craft of War a series. Each episode would spotlight a different class in combat. To give you a hint of what I'm currently thinking TCoW2 will be titled Mark, Counterspell, or Execute. Blind2 is also a possiblity and there's a comedy I'd like to try as well. Of course this is all dependent upon how Blind is recieved. If people think its crap then I probably won't be making anymore, hehe. If that's the case let's not ever bring this up again :) I've also included the trailer for Blind at the end. I had thought about putting out a trailer a month ago but it seems stupid to have a trailer for something thats only 7-8 minutes long. I thought it turned out cool so I've included it.<br />
<br />
All that being said I got some rather bad news a few months ago. The parent company of my game studio has decided lay everyone off. So with this impending layoff my future is unclear and I don't know when or if I'll be able to continue with The Craft of War. Perhaps this video will help me somehow if people like it and pass it around so please forward it to others. :) Although it's not perfect I decided to call it done and put it out there.<br />
<br />
About the song Hide &amp; Seek, although I don't speak or understand Japanese I thought the song fitting and would help me tell the story. I don't really have to understand the lyrics of a song to like it. It's more about the music and pacing and hopefully the song isn't about baking cakes when I'm showing fighting. If you're offended by foreign words then don't watch. There are some Spanish, German, and English songs that I'm considering for future episodes and even songs from previous fan videos you may have seen.<br />
<br />
I don't know what kind of a reaction I'll be getting but I may not be able to respond to all of the emails. I'll try and answer the most frequently asked questions by updating this summary.</div></div><hr />

That's considerably better than the stuff I've seen the animators at Blizzard do with their own tools. <br />
<br />
Like many, the only criticism is that I didn't much like the music either, but that's my personal preference in music, and to a large extent, my preconceptions about the sort of music that accompanies this sort of work, but it honestly detracts nothing from an excellent video.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Analogman101</div><div class="date">2008-12-27, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am quite shocked at that video. I've seen Tales of the Past, and A lot of really good Animation is out there. But I've never seen anything as Fluid and interactive as this. I mean seriously, if you look at the part where they are all inspecting the pub before she comes out, one of the Guards is going up the stairs on the left, and the Animator took the time to move his feet in precision to the stairs, EVERY STEP!!! And not just that, but the entire fight in the pub.... just wow. I didn't even know WoW character skins could move like that! And I don't know if you noticed, and I don't know if it's an in-game function or not, but the Swords Ms. Blind uses get beat up as the video goes on. It may just be Weapon Skins.... but I don't remember those weapons waving any blemishes... <br />
<br />
Simply stunning once again. The music was actually fairly fun. I enjoyed it. I'm really big into Choreography and music that fits such fights is key, and I feel the music not only matched the fights, but did in fact help the story along. As many qualms are with the music, which is silly, mine is a bit more grandiose. I would say that with the level of detail and animation in this, that the fights seemed a little lack luster... There were some neat parts, but all in all it seemed rather... Limited, in comparison to what could have been done with this kind of animation. An example is when the rogues are dueling outside the Keep. While some neat parts, it seemed more like I was watching a Wu-shu-Hong-Kong-Flying-movie than a down to earth fight between two extremely experienced fighters of the shadow. I saw in the Keep there were some little hit here and there on the guards as she Grappled with them, and I loved that. The little things like that that you can barely catch, those are the good fights to me. Where the fight is so fast, you hold your breath, watching to see what else they'll do. And when it's done, all you can do is blink and go &quot;Whoa.... did I really just watch that!?&quot; And the have to go back and watch it 3 more times in slow-motion to make sure you catch it all. <br />
<br />
But again, it was fantastic to see the animation, and the level of detail put into it. I am recommending Everyone I know to watch this video, and will probably end up Downloading it in really high quality once it's available. I really Hope his company pulls through, because this is some GREAT stuff. And it would be a shame to have it end so shortly after being discovered. I am interested in seeing how he plays with the other classes. I'm interested in seeing how brutal the Warrior fight is. How chaotic the Druid fight would be, shifting from form to form to form, the Mage fight which I picture to be something almost Like Dragon Ball, in that you have this gigantic force of magic crated and released. And the Hunter fight seems like it would be fairly interesting to try and do, keeping the pets in positioning, and the hunter's fighting style of ranged only, it seems like it would almost be a John Woo-esque fight with slow-mo bullet time and such.<br />
<br />
Oh yes. I do hope there are more of these. So much potential. I look forward to hearing about the next installment. <br />
<br />
Good job. Good mutha fraking job!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mennoknight</div><div class="date">2008-12-27, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@ comments about priests.<br />
<br />
The problem is that in BC, our Mitigation and healing potential scaled with damage. As the later seasons went on, we started scaling poorly because melee classes got armor penetration and insane dps boosts so the number of high ranked priests fell. (I think someone did some research and found the highest ranked priest in the world was only #43 on the list)<br />
<br />
With wrath, damage has seen a HUGE increase and a lot of the classes that were already tough for casters to deal with recieved more ways of controlling casters. Then there is the Deathnight, an anti-caster melee class. As some priests get the higher tier pvp gear, they might see more survivability, but how many people will get that gear in a system where nearly every 2's team is double dps (at least in my battlegroup)<br />
<br />
Disc priests did so well in BC because we didn't need to run away to survive, or even CC our opponent. we just needed to sit there and heal ourselves. Our survivability and healing ability scaled very poorly with this expac, so either we need some more CC abilities/escape tricks, or we need our shielding and instant heals (too many counterspell/kicks in the game to make others really worth it) to actually be dangerous again.</div></div><hr />

Also, I don't know if anyone noticed, but at the very end when they are facing off at the Valley of Hero's, watch just before she takes off. There's a little head tilt, it's oh so subtle, after she wipes of her cut. A payment of respect? A teasing &quot;not bad&quot;? I think so!</div></div><hr />

Completely different than all the other movies with some standard movement and such. Nice story with the single rogue doing entire stormwind solo and getting smashed by Onyxia (and also showing nobody knows she is yet) <br />
just so awesome!<br />

<br />
&quot;There are some great machinimas created by fans and at one point I thought about making a machinima as well but animation is what I do and I decided to use my skills in making something&quot;<br />
<br />
To me this says that they were thinking of making a machinima, but went with external animation tools, since that's what they use for their job. So I don't think they're claiming this as machinima, but I could be wrong</div></div><hr />

Your song choice is a perfect, absolutely flawless compliment to your artwork, and even adds a flavor to it that another song may have missed.<br />
<br />
As a rogue player among my favorites, I have seen these battles (more than SSing and eviscerating =P ) played out in my own head countless times, and I always wished I could find a way to bring the true beauty and agility of the class to life. You have done that and more. Your storyline (whether on purpose or just due to the date of production on this video) brings back the old school feel of pre-BC, which most veterans would tell you is most welcome. There is an innate rivalry and understanding beyond the obvious between both rogues in this video which I find astounding, seeing as you are working with WoW skins, regardless of however modified they may be.<br />
<br />
I look forward to any future videos you spring out of that fantastically artistic mind of yours. As much as I would love to see Blind2, if I may be bold enough to give advice, come back to it later after another class or two ;) Keep 'em on their toes wanting more. I also think you would do very well with comedy if you so wished. You do a great job of capturing the emotion and mood of the scene.<br />

This video imo, is flawless. It takes skills to do some things in life and talent is something that u cant just buy in a Computer Store, but most of all the inspiration that drives a man to do this and the finalization part are the best ever.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend u to apply to Blizzard as an animator or summat. These guys must keep an eye out for such talents like urself, and tbh YOUR FUTURE SHOULD NEVER BE UNCLEAR with this skills.<br />
<br />
I give u my word that i'll link that to my Guild-Site and many more pages so everyone will see this.<br />
<br />
Extraordinary work. Keep ur chin up and work on the next one.<br />
<br />
Thank u very much for sharing this excellence. Looking forward to see u in the highest ladder of well-known animators out there. U have a big future.<br />

<br />
You have created a beautiful work with the understanding of how to create a machinima, but also a gifted story writer. The story line you sat down was easy to follow, but intriguing. It could be taken for face value for those who do not know who Katrina Prestor is, but for those who do the story is much MUCH deeper. I enjoyed the choice of music you choose to set it to. It's slightly comical in the &quot;doesn't quite take itself 100% serious&quot; but it's very up-beat and can get your heart pounding with the video.<br />
<br />
Congratulations on a wonder master piece. I certainly do hope that your future holds good things for you. You are clearly a talented artist, and I hope to see another wonderful creation of yours in the future.<br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But to all you &quot;Blizzard should hire this guy&quot; people, shut it. Thank you. Do you honestly think that Blizzard can't make better animations then what there is in WoW at the current moment? Then you aren't using your heads.<br />
<br />
There exist REASONS why the animations we have in WoW are limited, animations require alot more from the computer when playing a game, then when seeing a movie. If you wan't to compare animations, compare his to those in Blizzards movies and not the games.<br />
<br />
Games have limits due to 'requirements can't go to high', limits in the engine which the game use and so on,<br />
Movies have no limites.</div></div><hr />

I like the music, though I don't think it fits particularly well. Also, the style of fighting is too stylistic (leaning more towards oriental martial arts than the rough, two dagger street-fighting style of rogues in game) and over the top (giant leaps, multiple strikes while twirling through the air). Albeit, I loved it for it was. Highly entertaining!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melkortopia</div><div class="date">2008-12-27, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saying it from the start, the movie is great.<br />
<br />
But to all you &quot;Blizzard should hire this guy&quot; people, shut it. Thank you. Do you honestly think that Blizzard can't make better animations then what there is in WoW at the current moment? Then you aren't using your heads.<br />
<br />
There exist REASONS why the animations we have in WoW are limited, animations require alot more from the computer when playing a game, then when seeing a movie. If you wan't to compare animations, compare his to those in Blizzards movies and not the games.<br />
<br />
Games have limits due to 'requirements can't go to high', limits in the engine which the game use and so on,<br />
Movies have no limites.<br />
<br />
<br />
#1) I think they meant to hire this guy for the Blizz Animation department. It's a big part of their production, actually, and they work on all the Blizzard products (Starcraft, Diablo, Warcraft, and probably the new yet-to-be-announced game as well).<br />
<br />
#2) That movie had way higher production values than even the Wrath Gate movie. In my opinion, this movie was much better.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see more.</div></div><hr />

The video is tailored around the soundtrack, try to look it again listening well at the music. You'll see that the flow of the actions follow precisely the rythm of the music.<br />
<br />
If you don't like it, its a matter of taste. But there isn't a better soundtrack for it, becouse the video and the music are one.</div></div><hr />

I think words would hae slowed the pace down-where would you have put words?<br />
<br />
1. She fights alone<br />
2. While fighting she has no time to talk<br />
3. The dynamics dont need speech-She is an ice blooded killer with only the target in her head, why the hell would she sit down in the pub and have a chat over a pint? It simply woulndt hae made sense.</div></div><hr />

The video itself was amazing. I also thought the music fit perfectly with what the video was about. I mean yeah, there could have been a more dark song since they are Rogues, but everyone already does that when they make a Rogue video. This one was more different than anything I've ever seen, and in the end it really paid off.</div></div><hr />

If you're offended by foreign words then don't watch.<br />
Do you know ppl that are offended by foreign words? How about ppl that are offended by gravity or by ppl eating ice cream?

If you like that then watch Haloid (Samus vs. Master Chief). I know it's not related to wow but it's probably one of the best machinimas and features amazing combat matrix style and even better animations. <br />

Good point on the fact that her hat is dropped by Onyxia, quite the irony indeed.<br />

All i have to say my friend u should make more and also this is the kind of people blizzard neeeds Bad.<br />
<br />
it seems blizzard lost creativity and the way the game use to be.<br />
<br />
somehow the game became boring in many aspects and raiding became kinda lame and no longer challenging.<br />
<br />
hope im wrong and that blizzard is right when they say is just the beggining and i kknow we already know the fights in naxx.<br />
<br />
but is actually the players that are coming up with the ideas of how this game should had turn out to be.<br />
<br />
Hope Blizzard sees this and help this fellow cause hopefully he can bring fresh thing s to a game and ideas and put em to work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Captures everything... In my humble opinion maybe carry on the story and add lesser characters, or possibly have the scenarios of the warrior/mage etc then put them all together in the end.<br />
<br />
who knows :)<br />
<br />
but stick to ur style, its the best video around simply because of ur taste in looks, sound cheorography and no weird voices (like the other wow movie which i didnt like) the music worked amazingly, id stick to that approch imo. :)<br />
<br />
KEEP IT UP :D</div></div><hr />

I don't generally like this style of music, but it fit perfectly once the action started. (The very beginning where the track came in sounded a bit comical, but it went from awkward to fitting like a glove when the tavern scene began. I think most of those that hated the music turned it off before it hit its stride; one person specifically said they turned sound off about one minute in.)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, what is with the animation showing a caster pwning a rogue? How unrealistic is that?<br />

The same video featuring any other class; now that would be worth my while.&quot;<br />
<br />
oh come on now this nothing like the billionth rogue video out nothing even compares to this video. its simply an ananimated fight video. which is by the way absolutely amazing can't wait for the other class battles he does.<br />
<br />
and for the people hating on the music give it a chance. if you give it a chance you'd notice that it fits perfectly with this video and the action that goes with it. yea its different and at first i thought kind of awkward when i heard but after a time or two watching it i like it. its catchy its molds with the video. and i gotta say that its rare to find a video like this where the music fits perfectly with the action and when it does fit its a work of art. <br />

seriously dude keep up the good work! i wonder if he has a website with updates on the next video unless i missed it somewhere in the description.</div></div><hr />

Thank you. Do you honestly think that Blizzard can't make better animations then what there is in WoW at the current moment? Then you aren't using your heads.<br />
<br />
There exist REASONS why the animations we have in WoW are limited, animations require alot more from the computer when playing a game, then when seeing a movie. If you wan't to compare animations, compare his to those in Blizzards movies and not the games.<br />
<br />
Games have limits due to 'requirements can't go to high', limits in the engine which the game use and so on,<br />
Movies have no limites.<br />
<br />

Wrathgate is prerendered and is there as an avi movie. It wouldn't matter if it was two colors or a clip from starwars they were showing.</div></div><hr />

Thanks big time for all the kudos. It's awesome to see so many enjoy the video. All of a sudden I'm kind of afraid of making another. What if it doesn't measure up and everyone turns against me? LOL&quot;<br />

Hope it helps.<br />
Again, an incredible movie.<br />
<br />
<br />
update - December 28<br />
<br />
First off I'd like to thank all of you for all of the compliments and even the criticisms. I set out to try and make something I think would be cool and hoped others would think so too. I thought I'd update this summary and give some background info in case people were interested and also address the some issues people had.<br />
<br />
Many have been asking how the movie was created. I'm sure others have guessed that the models were exported and imported into a 3D application. The WoW model viewer has an option to export models and 3D Studio Max is the 3D app I used to create BLIND. I won't get into the details but with minimal searching you can find out how to do it yourselves. Machinima sites also have information and even tutorials. Video editing was done with a mix of Adobe AfterEffects and Sony Vegas. Minor texture work was done in Photoshop. All of the software I used have downloadable demos and I encourage people to give it a try. I'm not going to lie to you. There's no magic button that makes things look good. It takes practice and dedication. Also I'm going to respectfully decline anyone asking for aid with their movies. I put off playing WoW and other games for many months to create BLIND. It's time I started playing games again and then there's the upcoming layoff I have to worry about.<br />
<br />
The music wasn't something I choose at random but an element that I consider to be just as important as the models, lighting, animations,...etc. It was the driving force for the pace and the inspiration for the story. Its modern sound did make me hesitant but you have other machinimas and boss kill videos to thank/blame for helping me decide to use it. :) Since others have used modern music versus grand orchestrated scores I thought that was enough to soften the blow and wouldn't seem a huge shock. With the feedback I've gotten consider your voices heard and it'll be something I take into account in the future. I still think I made the right decision and it's not something I'm going to go back and change so lets agree that we disagree. :)<br />
<br />
There have been some comments on the animation and I totally admit that I'm not the greatest animator. When you work on something in your spare time for fun after a long while it ceases to be fun and becomes more like work. So you have to know when to call it good enough and stop and move on rather then spend countless more days,weeks, or even months on it. Try putting together a 7minute long animation by yourself while working long hours at a full time job. It's not as easy as it sounds, hehe.<br />
<br />
Some have a problem with the style of the animations. No, my animations are not PIXAR-like or Clone Wars-like. I purposely stayed away from animations that I felt to be comedic. It would be ridiculous to have the characters animate like a Disney cartoon. I wasn't striving for realistic either. If you want realistic moves I don't know why youre playing WoW then. You should be playing Second Life or something like that. Do you even fight in Second Life? I don't know. What I tried to do was achieve something in between extreme exaggeration and reality and try and top it off with some coolness.<br />
<br />
Some extra info:<br />
-The rogue was the obvious choice for having someone sneeking into Stormwind but I choose a bloodelf because I didn't want to deal with the animation style of one of the other Horde races. The blood elves where the most human-like race plus I think the blood elf female the most attractive player model.<br />
-In the tavern there were 3 extra guards the female rogue killed off. Once I started editing the fight together I realized I didn't have the time to show the other 3 guards because the song length wouldn't allow it so they were cut out. Some of the rogue fight had to be cut as well.<br />
-Not wanting to discriminate on sex I was going to put in female guards to be killed too but saved it as a wishlist item for the very end. When the very end came I asked myself, &quot;Do I really want to rerender these shots? Na, screw it.&quot;<br />
-Lady Katrana Prestor wasn't going to be the final confrontation originally. It was to be an npc in the Cathedral of Light but after thinking on it more I didn't want the assasin to be considered evil and I didn't want to involve another class. Lady Prestor became the obvious choice. Also it seems like everyone wants to solo Onyxia these days. I thought it would be great to revisit WoW preBC and show just how awesome and badass the brood mother of the black dragonflight was. She doesn't even take a step the entire time shes being attacked.<br />
-After choosing Lady Prestor the original second major encounter wasn't against another rogue but a group of black dragonflight masquerading as Lady Prestors elite gaurds. After the encounter in the tavern I wanted to see more high flying rogue action so I changed it to another rogue. A male was chosen because I wanted her to have somewhat of an opposite and they would each mark the other as a rival and equal. Make no mistake though, she views humans as the enemy and viseversa and she is merciless against any in her way. As I was working on BLIND I couldn't help but develop a past and future for the two rogues. If their story continues they won't always be enemies but they will face each other as enemies a few more times before theyre, well, not enemies.<br />
-Two of my Alliance toons make cameos in BLIND. My Paladin has a tragic death by getting his neck broken. :)<br />

<br />
As far as the song i thought it fit quite well. I think a little more diversity than just the two tunes would have been better but I discovered a new artist to look into now. <br />
<br />
This movie made me start a rogue if that counts for anything :)</div></div><hr />

The music, however, totally raped (nay, murdered) the overall feel of the music. I hope to see more of it, but with a better soundtrack.</div></div><hr />

Too bad I'm at work and didn't get to hear the sound :(<br />
<br />
I loved the contrast of the opposing rogues in color, race, and gender, yet how equal they are as opponents without painting either as good or evil (yet).<br />
<br />
I'd love to see more of their encounters and how their story evolves - please, please continue on with the story! So far it's already better than a lot of shows on TV!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Music choice was perfect, don't let a few critics keep you from choosing the music that fits your vision. If every video gets done to the same music it's going to get boring. Besides, videos like this are a great way to *gasp* expand our exposure to new genres. Quit pitching a fit about 7 minutes of music.<br />
<br />
This is what the WoW trailers and in-game cut scenes should look like. All the animated trailers are over-animated and look nothing like the renderings in the game. Yes, they look awesome, but it's not what you see in the game. The in-game cut scenes are, well, lackluster and limited by using the in-game mechanics and emotes. This video bridged the gap between the animation and the &quot;reality&quot; of the game. All the models are recognizable and the level of detail is insane (watch the guard going up the stairs - my toon can't even get up stairs that well, hehe).<br />
<br />
I hope MMO Champion continues to post new ones as they are released. I'm off to tell my guild to come watch. And maybe to roll a rogue...<br />

<br />
i thought music choice was excellent!, every damn wow video always plays some damn techno or hard rock/industrial rock crap that gets repetive, and for what? to prove that you're some bamf that has a deathmetal theme song? <br />
plus i enjoyed the international effect, to me you dont need to understand the lyrics, its how the rythmn makes you feel! you said you're looking for more international songs to feature in your vids so i'll just leave my sugestions: <br />
<br />
fleur de saison- emilie simon (french)<br />
inner mir syngur vitley syngur/glosoli/hoppipola/saeglopur/gobbledigook- sigur ros (icelandic- any song by them basically kicks ass) ;D<br />
diablo rojo/tamacun- roberto y gabriela (spanish guitar- also kicks ass)<br />
jalouse/le cul entre deux chaises- mademoiselle k (french)<br />
<br />
theres always rammstein but thats way overused- although &quot;engel&quot; would be sick and its not so overplayed</div></div><hr />

It was especially exciting for me, being a Rogue :) My hubby told my mom and me about this video last night while we were logged in. The way he described it to us was that it was better than the cutscene in the quest we had completed not too long ago in Dragonblight. He was SO right!<br />
<br />
What employer could possibly let you slip out of their hands?? :o<br />

Thank you for making the video, and I can't wait to see more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bluedevil21</div><div class="date">2008-12-31, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The animation in the video was amazing, but the music really hurt it sadly. No it wasn't because 'it's not English', it's because it didn't fit the mood at all. Stormwind guard is patrolling the streets and finds one of his comrades slain in a corner... queue the wacky hijinks! &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The music was perfect. Movies like this are movies of revolution. Hands-down a 10/10 even on the use of music. The music was perfect, &amp; those that commented about it, just aren't open-minded to it. Judges are open-minded &amp; see outside the box. The creator has a future in animation, &amp; should apply for any top dog company. <br />
<br />
p.s. I love &amp; 100% agree with the creator on not changing his views or mind on the music used. The music help tell a story with very little English, not many movies are able to do that.</div></div><hr />

The thing is, what hes using isnt anything new or unheard of, he just dabs in animation, the programs hes using are probably quite common to most animators. Using them he could probably make motions that most people have not seen...be seen, which looks amazing. Machinima makers usually use default movements provided from WoWmodelviewer. The fact that the creator is using animation tools actually wouldn't make it machinima.<br />
<br />
I'd still like to know how long it takes to make an animation video such as that though.</div></div><hr />

I honestly don't get what is so &quot;amazing&quot; about that vid.<br />
The best wow vid I've seen so far (beside &quot;blue dress&quot; and, maybe &quot;internet is for p0rn&quot;), was Nihilum AQ40 movie (very well made and nice music as well)</div></div><hr />

true but like you said, nobody uses this tech and id hope in the future we could see more machinima makers use this.<br />
and if it were my guess depending on skill in this it couldve taken anywhere between a few weeks to months.</div></div><hr />
