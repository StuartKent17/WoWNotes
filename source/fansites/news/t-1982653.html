Blue Posts<br />
Prestige and Honor Talents<br />
We aren't planning any changes to how Honor Talents and Prestige work in Ranked Play. The cost and conflict is intentional. It's important that in order for Prestige levels to feel prestigious, there is a high cost to doing it. You do not have to Prestige. There is no competitive advantage to doing it. There are rewards but they are entirely cosmetic. If you see someone with a high Prestige level, we want you to know they went through a lot to get it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/408759-pvp-game-mode-restrictions-need-to-go-prestige-rated/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742809860?page=2#31))<br />
<br />
Skirmishes in Legion<br />
We've made a change to Skirmish in Legion. Rather than having two separate buttons (2v2 and 3v3), there is only one button and it will put you in either 2v2 or 3v3 depending on a number of factors. Our experience with the separate buttons in Warlords was that you would often end up in 2s match where only one team had a healer or a 3s match with triple DPS. Neither of these situations felt very fun and the reality is there are far less healers playing than damage. We want Skirmishes queues to pop fast but allow for pretty fair fights.<br />
<br />
In Legion, healers specs are always placed in 3v3 matches while damage specs are placed in either 2v2 or 3v3 depending on what is available. This means 2v2 skirmishes will never have healers in them and 3v3 matches will always have healers on each team.<br />
<br />
So much for couples that liked to play 2's<br />
Ranked 2s is still available. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/408741-3s-skirmish-gone-for-good-or-just-in-the-currnet-built/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743254500?page=1#8))<br />
<br />
PvP talents<br />
You can only unlock Honor talents at level 110.<br />
<br />
You should remove the &quot;honour&quot; experience bar from low levels then.<br />
Agreed. That is in progress. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/408732-pvp-talents/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743154533?page=1#8))<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds on Beta<br />
Battleground are not launching because there are not enough people queuing for them. Our plan is to temporarily disable skirmishes when we launch beta to get some focused battleground testing while concurrency is high. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/408735-battlegrounds/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743094420?page=1#8))<br />
<br />
Relentless (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/196029-relentless) PvP Talent<br />
We think there is a group of players that would prefer to just be in less CC overall. It may not be as attractive at the very highest ratings and that's okay. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/408729-relentless-pvp-talent/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743244550?page=1#5))<br />

Affliction Warlock Feedback -- Build 21466 -- 13-Apr<br />
Not entirely feedback, but there's no good place to ask this and it effects future feedback so:<br />
<br />
Can we get a confirmed value on agony's soul shard proc rate for affliction? In previous expansions the information was available in spell data on the nightfall passive, but there doesn't seem to be any spell data for agony's proc rate anymore.<br />
<br />
I did a couple thousand tick test awhile back and got an estimate around 13.5% but any modeling of the spec will be estimation without spell data or a confirmed value.<br />
Similar to before, it's a ramping proc chance. The first tick, it's 2.5%. Assuming that fails to proc, next tick it'll be 5%, then 7.5%, etc. When it does proc, the next tick returns to 2.5%.<br />
<br />
So in a general sense, its proc rate is: TicksSinceLastSuccessfulProc * 2.5%<br />
<br />
That averages out to ~13.15%, but much smoother and reliable that a simple 13.15% proc chance.<br />
<br />
Now that we got some Blue posting in Affliction feedback thread. Can we get an explanation to the Legion re-design of Unstable Affliction spamming. I've leveled a 3rd Affliction lock on alpha, and I am already seeing myself incredibly bored and unappealed with this weird focus of spamming Frostbolt---I mean UA. <br />
<br />
Sidenote: I play 3 Aff locks on live, I need to know if I have the tolerance to fast level 3 Aff locks at launch.<br />
<br />
Anyways... Was this design solely made on paper, and not exercised prior to presenting it to the Affliction Warlock playerbase? I don't feel like a warlock, I feel like a Frost Mage. I love the talent tree, it has so much potential depth. I love the tanky-ness, does give me a more resilient. That UA spamming though... I don't know how long I can muster playing that style of DPS. One of the reasons I rolled out of Mage in p1.8 and embraced the Affliction in 1.9. ALL HAIL! THE ONE TRUE GOD, FOREDOOMED!<br />
I've heard this feedback many times, and have yet to have it make any sense. As far as gameplay goes, you do something like one UA every ~8sec (single target). That doesn't really jive with the 'spamming UA sucks' feedback. You may very well do several back to back, but then go a long period with casting none. So where is this 'spamming UA sucks' feedback coming from?<br />
<br />
Is the ramping soulshard proc chance on agony different for each individual agony or is it based on all agony's you have out?<br />
All Agonys you have out. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/408177-affliction-warlock-feedback-build-21466-13-apr/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743214168?page=2#35))<br />

<br />
They are targeting the audience that actually needs the marketing, decided to just put that out right on the table in simple terms, in case your brain couldn't comprehend the idea behind that trailer. The audience that is aware of Warcraft and knew there'll be a Warcraft movie long before the movie was announced will go to see the movie one way or another. Show me a fan of Warcraft who doesn't know about the movie yet. Now show me a random fellow on the street which would never see the movie if it wasn't for the &quot;pop&quot; kind of advertising. See?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats not the point, peoples first impressions are what counts. Many people will associate that music with being in the film thereby making a bad impression. I am excited to see the movie but if I wasnt a wow player that music would have turned me off. Face it music sets the tempo and feel of a movie. I hope they have a better track lined up for the next trailer, im not saying do some complex orchestra piece. But make the music fantasy war themed.<br />
<br />
Oh also I do think a lot of people are getting bad vibes because of the sound, do what I did play the trailer with sound off while playing the chorus to Invincible or another epic wow piece. Actually changed the feel of the trailer for me.</div></div><hr />

That's why LOTR's and The Hobbit had Moby in their trailers, right? And The Harry Potter trailers had metal core. Right? <br />

A trailer helps set the mood. The music is appropriate for an action movie like The Fast and Furious, not a sword and sorcery themed fantasy.<br />

<br />
And still I'm unsure about the art they gone with ... I know warcraft has a unique, comical style, but the scenes right now look still &quot;misplaced&quot; like bad cgi. Like the screne in front of stormwind. it's like they cut out 20 single pictures and glued them all together.<br />

Honestly by late August the movie will be a distant memory from an in-theater standpoint, and is around when the blu-ray release would be. It kind of shoots down the theories of the movie giving the game a second life. In fact to me it kind of shows a lack of confidence by Blizzard in the movie. My guess is they've seen early screenings internally and realized that it's more of an average in and out of theaters in a few weeks type of movie than a blockbuster.</div></div><hr />

I could be wrong but isn't the movie studio doing like...the whole thing? Funding and marketing everything? Blizzard just gets a say in the lore and probably a cut of the profits if it does well.<br />

Which means they can deflect blame to the studio if it fails, too.<br />

<br />
And here we go... The Blizzard-bashing part of the topic...<br />
<br />
It's Legendary that its making the movie, not Blizzard. Blizzard only says &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to some directions the movie goes. The production of the movie is up to Duncan Jones, his team and Legendary. <br />
<br />
<br />
As for the music, yea... Weird choice, but it's just a trailer... And i think that the CGI doesn't look bad. Its pretty nice. Not Avatar level (yet) but it's getting pretty good with the post-production. Just go to the Digital Theater site and download the lossless version of the one of the trailers and compare with the youtube one... Youtube compression and bitrate reduction make movies look like crap.</div></div><hr />

Well it's all about perspective my friend. What you and I have experienced in WoW, others haven't. This movie is going to reach millions of people and more than 90% probably haven't heard of the game or the lore even, so this is just noise and cool shots to tell the rest:&quot;Come see me I'm shiny&quot;.<br />

Same here. People at work know I'm a huge fan and keep asking me about it. Even my friends who have never played the game are hyped right now.<br />

The dubstep music was off, the story was non-existent beyond &quot;Some green Orcs are invading our lands, so let's unite to stop them, oh and some brown orcs want to ally with us for no reason given... and some people are Wizards in this fantasy.&quot; I don't know. The green orc chick looked awkward and cheezy as hell as she jumped on to the horse/wolf thing. The dialogue was weak. Was that supposed to be a quirky line the main dude threw in there as he was talking to the one soldier beaten on the ground as the other brown orc tossed him aside? I don't get it... So much of this trailer made me uncomfortable and I think it was mainly the dialogue and the music.<br />
<br />
The first trailer wasn't great, but it was a hell of a lot better than this one. Oh geesh. I really hope they redeem themselves with the 3rd and likely final trailer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It can backfire, but for me, the whole thing still looks better than &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. I was quite hyped for that movie, but besides having Jeremy Irons as the big baddy, the D&amp;D movie was awful. The black elven ranger was only there because the other black guy needed someone to hit on, they had on the one hand political correctness en masse, but it was just awkward. The only elves with black skin in D&amp;D are drow, and these are cruel, evil, and have white hair. The whole plot was stupid and on the niveau of a beginner Dungeon Master. Also, why is everyone making fun of Dwarves? While they can add some humour to the whole thing, I often feel that this is too much jokes at their expense. (And I am not even a big fan of Dwarves....)<br />

Exactly my thought - is it because I know the cinematics from Blizzard and the game - or is the CGI quality far behind that of CGI heavy films like Avatar, Lord of the Rings, etc.<br />

If I watch the trailers I have the feeling that die CGI sequences are from the game itself and not from a full scale movie.</div></div><hr />

The audience that is aware of Warcraft and knew there'll be a Warcraft movie long before the movie was announced will go to see the movie one way or another. Show me a fan of Warcraft who doesn't know about the movie yet. Now show me a random fellow on the street which would never see the movie if it wasn't for the &quot;pop&quot; kind of advertising. See?<br />
<br />
And The Prodigy does that? No. It doesn't fit at all, and cheapens the whole thing. It's like whoever did the sound just put on their favourite song at the moment. But thanks for the condescending attitude, really drove your point home.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Most of these posts are insane. Are you guys OK? LOL</div></div><hr />

Ontop of that most of the cgi environment looks fake. <br />
^If they made the whole movie digital it would not be so terrible. <br />
Something ala shrek/ ice age/ tintin and it could be passable. <br />
<br />
For it to work for me in this format the cgi needs to be completly indistinguishable from a real life actor in a mask/actual video footage of landscapes and its not even close to that.<br />
The only convincing part are the main human actors.<br />
Apart from the female orc, she just looks like a human with green fingerpaint.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW is that Raina from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.?<br />
<br />
Ya that's Ruth Negga who played Raina.</div></div><hr />

Can't please everyone especially when it comes to wow. Either see the movie or don't, stop crying about it like they are going to change it because of fanboys qq. <br />
<br />
I will wait til the movie comes out to pass judgement at least...</div></div><hr />

I am of the same opinion, a fully CGI movie would have been much better.<br />
<br />
My guess as to why Blizzard chose a movie against animation, is that it is generally much longer to produce - more like 4-5 years than 2, and time is of essence now that the game is on life support.<br />
<br />
Also, I really would have preferred a true story (say the Lich King's story), versus the generic H2+Alliance vs other orcs.</div></div><hr />

Almost perfect, see now this changes the whole feel of the trailer. It feels far more substantial and pulls an emotional cord with its audience.</div></div><hr />

Lakeshire, Dalaran and Stormwind are perfect movie counterparts to the game versions. Good or bad, I'm going to have fun pausing the blu-ray to catch all the details.</div></div><hr />
