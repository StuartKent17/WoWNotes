Cataclysm Rare and Rare Elite Monsters (with the help of Simca (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/545200))<br />
In Cataclysm, there are the standard rare spawns like there have always been. They drop blues and some additional gold and there are quite a few in every zone. However, there are also a few special rares that deserve a mention.<br />
We agree with you, which is why these aren't outdoor raid bosses. A good STRONG 5 player group should be able to handle these bosses, but you certainly have the option to make a raid and give it a shot as well. Good luck.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. 5-man World Bosses<br />
There are five of these new world bosses, one in each zone. Each one has 3-5 abilities (Julak-Doom has a mind control, Xariona does void zones, etc), but they're mostly straightforward fights. Each drops several hundred gold and one specific item.<br />
<br />
Note: The Whale Shark and Vaskar don't count because they drop no loot and aren't rare.<br />

<br />
2. Special Rares<br />
There are two other rare spawns that function in very unique ways, and both reward very interesting mounts.<br />
<br />
2.1 Aeonaxx - Deepholm (Flying Mount)<br />
The first of the two is &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/50062/aeonaxx/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aeonaxx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, who flies around Deepholm. The unique part is that you don't attack Aeonaxx to engage him. He starts out friendly, and then you right-click him to mount him like a vehicle. From here on, the fight takes place entirely on his back and he will erratically fly around Deepholm presumably trying to shake you off. The only source of damage to you in this fight is little whelp adds that Aeonaxx will call to his aid. When killed, he drops &lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/63042/reins-of-the-phosphorescent-stone-drake/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;item4&quot;&gt;Reins of the Phosphorescent Stone Drake&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2010/december/phosphodrake.jpg (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/63042/reins-of-the-phosphorescent-stone-drake/)<br />
<br />
2.2 Dormus the Camel-Hoarder<br />
The second rare is even more strange. There are rare spawn &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/50410/mysterious-camel-figurine/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mysterious Camel Figurines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; around Uldum. When clicked on, sometimes these figurines will just disappear and leave you with vendor trash. Other times, it will teleport you to an area between Feralas and Silithus called the &quot;The Steam Pools&quot;, which has its separate zone channel and everything. An elite will spawn called &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/50245/dormus-the-camel-hoarder/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dormus the Camel-Hoarder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The actual fight against Dormus is very easy as he doesn't hit very hard at all. When he is dead, he will drop &lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/63046/reins-of-the-grey-riding-camel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;item4&quot;&gt;Reins of the Grey Riding Camel&lt;/a&gt;!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2010/december/greycamel.jpg (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/63046/reins-of-the-grey-riding-camel/)<br />
<br />
The problem is, Mysterious Camel Figurines (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/50410/mysterious-camel-figurine/) are extremely rare, already extremely camped, and not that easy to spot... I think you'll just never get this mount... Bah, ok, I'll help. <br />
<br />
<br />
3. NPCScan to the Rescue!<br />
NPCScan (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/npcscan.aspx) is an addon that will make your life considerably easier, it tracks rare monsters by proximity alone and completely removes the need of a /Target macro to check if a rare monster is in range. The thing is, Mysterious Camel Figurines (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/50410/mysterious-camel-figurine/) are handled as creature by the game and using NPCScan to find them will work just fine! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
NPCScan download on Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/npcscan.aspx)<br />
<br />
<br />
The current version of NPCScan isn't updated for Cataclysm because the add-on builds its list of rare-elites by scanning the achievement, sadly there isn't any achievement to hunt rare monsters in Cataclysm. To scan for Cataclysm rare monsters, type /npcscan in-game and add their creatureID (left column in the table below) and their name to the list of custom NPCs to track.<br />
<br />
&lt;table class=&quot;sortable news-table&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;<br />
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th width=&quot;60&quot;&gt;NPC ID&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th width=&quot;175&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th width=&quot;200&quot;&gt;Zone&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th width=&quot;200&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;<br />
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;50409&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot; href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/50409&quot;&gt;Mysterious Camel Figurine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Uldum&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;See 2.2 Dormus the Camel-Hoarder&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;50410&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot; href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/50410&quot;&gt;Mysterious Camel Figurine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Uldum&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;See 2.2 Dormus the Camel-Hoarder&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />

&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />

That's how you want it to look (I deleted the pre-built WotLK custom NPCs, you don't have to do that)<br />
<br />
<br />
3.1 Hunter Rare Pets<br />
You can obviously use it to scan all the rares included in the expansion, for example it's incredibly useful if you're a hunter looking for rare pets! <br />

3.2 Level 80+ Rare Monsters<br />
Also, even if there isn't any rare-related achievement for Cataclysm it's always a nice boost of experience when find one while you're leveling alts. I listed most of them but a few are probably missing. <br />

If people really wanted these rares then they could research, camp and wait like the rest of us. What boub has done is just hand them everyone elses hardwork on a silver platter and now the people who worked on getting most of that info now have to compete with everyone who has seen the post.

There was already plenty of information available for Aeonaxx if you read these forums or had anyone in guild in vaguely interested in rare mounts. Yes, it would have been lots of fun having to compete for a rare spawn achievement, now with hundreds - at the very least - flying around on every server with passive rare detection.</div></div><hr />

Ah well, good post at least. I'm glad to see NPC Scan being recommended as it's my favourite addon. It scares the crap out of me whenever it goes off and tells me there's a rare nearby, especially if it's one I'm looking for, but it's so very useful. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The mounts are not made for YOU, you know. They're made for everyone, and not just the people that sit there for days and nights camping for it either. It's all down to pure luck whether or not you catch a rare. Everyone is entitled to getting the mount. (I'm assuming you're talking about Aeonaxx here.) <br />
<br />
Boub here is informing people that this mount exists. Sure, it's more fun to actually find out about these things yourself, like I did. But if there's suddenly a whole lot more people camping the area because of this MMO-Champion post, live with it and just keep trying to get the mount. The point is that it's there for people to find either out of luck or out of competition, and trust me, when you finally get the mount yourself and there's still loads of people around looking for the same thing you were, it'll feel so awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's nothing to be bitter about. The length of &quot;camping&quot; doesn't suddenly mean you're more worthy of the mount. The whole point of Rare spawns is they're challenge, both in the finding and in the capture/killing. If someone beats you to it, bad luck. Try again.<br />
<br />
And I've been camping Aeonaxx on and off since day 1, still no sightings.</div></div><hr />

I already knew about the mount stuff, been camping them since launch, and I don't mind this at all. You people really are something else. You should all be ashamed. Grow up a bit, please.<br />
<br />
Sooner or later it will be your turn to catch it. We have 1.5-2 years of this expansion people, relax a bit. You all know that more than 99% of the people who suddenly show up do not have the patience or the stamina to actually camp something, and will either get bored or some other shiny will grab their attention within 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
If it matters that much to you, then by all means camp it, you will get it sooner or later. If someone got it before you, be good sports about it and congratulate them on their good fortune, that is one less person camping your spawn. Besides, you know you would want them to give you the recognition and praise if the roles were reverse. If it is just another wanna-be status symbol however, another notch on the bedpost, or another number for a mount achievement you should have had completed a long time ago; quit the whining, you only make yourself look bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one is 'worthy' of getting a mount. Even if you've been camping for days and nights without sleep and finally get it, it doesn't make you suddenly any more 'worthy' of having the mount than someone who's never even heard of the mob when they go, 'Oohh that looks pretty' and kills it to find that it drops some funky looking mount. <br />
<br />
I've found the Time-Lost Proto-Drake before, and killed it, on an old DK character. (Who I have since deleted, no I wasn't willing to keep a character I was getting sick of just for a rare mount.) The fact that I found Time-Lost out of pure coincidence doesn't make me feel bad because there were people that appeared 10 seconds later going 'I've been camping that thing for months!'. (None of these people got mad with me, by the way, they all acted very friendly.) And I did not say sorry, because when you get a mount like that, even if you've been camping for days for it, it's all out of pure luck in the end, who's around at the time when it spawns, whether or not they have NPC Scan, etc. Pure luck.<br />
<br />
With Time-Lost, I did have NPC Scan, and I can say that without that addon I never would've seen it pass by. I was killing harpies for the old 400 unarmed skill achievement when it literally must've spawned above me as NPC Scan went off, so I just looked around all over the place for it and I just happened to get there about a milli-second before someone else did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aeonaxx just spawned in Deepholm on a relatively quiet night. Very few people were online on my realm at the time. I was almost to him when someone else who was closer managed to hop on him before me. I whispered him after he killed it (Thank god it wasn't a lowbie that'd die and DESPAWN AEONAXX), to learn that he had gone to Deepholm and camped for a max of 30 mintues before Aeonaxx spawned after reading MMO-Champion.<br />
<br />
So basically I lost the mount because of this.<br />
<br />
It may not be ruining my 'hard work', but it's still a pretty bitter pill to swallow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had been looking for Aeonaxx, didn't run into him the past week, though I'm pretty discouraged by it as a hunter since he can't be attacked with hunter ranged attacks, meaning we'd have to beat on him with white hits and raptor strikes for 20 minutes. ._.</div></div><hr />

SilverDragon isn't as good. You have to actually mouse over the rare to set that off whereas NPC Scan tells you the second that the mob appears.</div></div><hr />

Only if you don't display nameplates:<br />
<br />
If you have nameplates enabled it'll scan through them to find rares nearby. Otherwise it requires you to mouseover/target a rare, or for your party member/pets to do likewise.</div></div><hr />

Of course the first day that something like this is posted all the spots are going to be camped. Its common sense! However how many of these people will really give it the time and effort it takes to locate and kill a rare spawn. Wait a few weeks and I can only assume that the number will be back down to the hardcore few :)<br />
<br />
Its very similiar to what happens on the Auction House when something gets posted on Just My Two Copper. Every Tom. Dick and Harry runs out and does exactly as the post says and either floods or dries the market. The best thing to do is save the information somewhere and use it a few weeks later when everything is normalised again. <br />

EDIT: I dont get how you people can be mad?! Eventually pretty much everyone will know about it. But if you REALLY want this mount and you're able to rage about it, you'll get it. People who just found out, I guess, will leave him bcuz they cba camp him.</div></div><hr />

Makes it a bit better I suppose, but you're not always close enough to a mob to have the nameplate come up right away. NPC Scan would be better for the people that like to do something away from the computer while camping a rare and have some kind of technique to stop themselves from going AFK.</div></div><hr />

Please realize there are no &quot;secrets&quot; in an MMO of this scale, with a community this big. The info is somewhere, it will get out, especially about something of this magnitude.<br />

grow up pls its only a game.<br />
<br />
To be fair, I reserve the right to QQ if I've been camping for 6+ days with very minimal sleep, and some guy who decides to camp right on top of me because he read about it on MMO-Champ and figures I've got the best spawn down, beats me to it because of his better reaction time of not having only 12 hours of sleep the past 6 nights. I understand its a FFA game, but still...have a little heart people. If you're going to camp, don't be rude and use a spot with someone already in it. It ruins both of your chances if the guy spawns there.<br />
<br />
But hey, what am I saying? People are just going to say: &quot;lol, QQ more, loser&quot;, especially the guy I'm replying to. Its a cut throat world! RNG! You're not entitled to anything! I know these things, its all part of the game, just as most of the people who want this mount are my competition, and I don't have the right to stop them, no matter how much effort I've put in or desire I have.<br />
<br />
I'm only saying that people could be slightly less jerks every now and then.</div></div><hr />

so you are angry that someone else might get it with less time invested? LOL, you have some f'd up priorities. No one put a gun to your head and said &quot;CAMP THIS MOB&quot;.

No, I'm angry because there's going to be a multitude of people who really just don't give two shits about collecting or rare mounts flying around looking for it just because they saw it on this site. I would have absolutely no problem losing the mount to someone who cares about this stuff and took the time to look into rare mounts before 2 weeks after launch. You (and most others with similar replies) really don't seem to get the other side of the argument here, though, coming back with &quot;lol you're obsessed, it's a game, go outside&quot; etc..., so there's no point in arguing with blind people.</div></div><hr />

The people who want these rare spawns already knew about them, and this post has only SERVERELY lowered the possibility that those hardcore/crazy rare spawn campers will ever get what they have been working hard for. This will cause any and every noob who plays wow to now troll these zones in search of these npcs. For example, after a particular death knight..... and some others had been camping for a few days, Aeonaxx finally spawns. Mr. newly level 85 ret paladin ( I won't mention names even though I really want to :x) decides he is gonna get him some pretty shoulder enchants from dailies and maybe search for that new rare spawn MMOchampion is talking about. Oh look Aeonaxx just happens to spawn as he is traveling to dailies, merely meters away from where many were camping. So the paladin mounts, and then fails/despawns the npc 30-45 seconds later.... <br />
<br />
I understand this could happen at any point with or without the aid of the OP. However, there was absolutely no need to flood the zones with everyone and their sister looking for new mount. Thank you MMOchampion for blowing ish up........</div></div><hr />

The truth is you wouldn't know if that person was a casual or some guy who took the time to find the mob exactly as you describe. Evident by your posts I would highly doubt you would be so &quot;cool with it&quot; as you describe. As such your tears of indignant rage keeps me fed quite well.<br />

Chaoyll: Sure the Mounts are for all People here BUT if they do not find it out by themselfes...do they deserve it?<br />

By your logic, you don't deserve the mount either. You didn't find out about it yourself, you relied on the work of other people that you found by reading through 1000s of comments.<br />

They're similar because the &quot;argument&quot; constantly being used is &quot;OMG YOU DIDN'T DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH SO YOU DON'T DESERVE TO GET IT&quot;.<br />
<br />
I could similarly state &quot;OMG YOU DIDN'T RESEARCH THE LOOT THAT DROPS FROM THE BOSS SO YOU DON'T DESERVE TO GET IT&quot;.<br />

The part where your logic fails, however, is where it's common knowledge that you do dungeons and heroics to get gear for raiding and then raid to get your epics.<br />
It is *not* common knowledge (at least, it wasn't) that you camp deepholm for a mount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The vast majority of the player base will be like me and not give a hoot....and that blip of increased numbers camping spawn sites will drop pretty quickly because &quot;Wrath babies&quot; don't do anything that requires any effort and won't spend the time and effort camping spawn sites if they don't get lucky almost immediately....so all you people with RSD (rare spawn disorder) should take a chill pill or go see a good psychologist.</div></div><hr />

Also, I feel so sorry for people doing all this &quot;hard work&quot; (hard mental work? physical work?) finding out about this mount. <br />
They really screwed you now, didn't they? XD It must really suck knowing that every &quot;mouth breather&quot; (not my words, someone else just had to use this term in this thread again to .. prove their point?) has a fair shot at the mount now, if they happen to see the rare NPC, hmm? <br />

On beta, Poseidus had a 100% drop rate of a mount, a seahorse you can ride outside of Vashj'ir. Since live I haven't heard any reports of him dropping this mount; was it removed?<br />

Besides, if you really want the mount you'll get it.

I recently killed Armagedillo in Uldum and ran into an interesting problem; The BoE tail is stuck on my drood, trying to mail it off gives you and error of &quot;limited duration item&quot; much like if you tried to send ... mana cake. I do not know if this is the only on that has this problem but the wowhead page has a variety of ways around it.. sell it on the AH or put it in a guild bank to pick it up, trading flat out does not seem to work either and shows the wrong item. so if you try to get this for one of your alts be warned that it can be painful to try and get rid of.</div></div><hr />

i knew someone would get confused when i compared this to spoilers. Obviously its not a spoiler for those who have taken the time to attain this information. Heres an analogy that might help you understand as you arent &quot;getting it&quot; atm. Say you use Ebay and you are looking for a lounge suite at a real bargain price. After a couple of weeks a nice one appears on the site and you bid on it. No one else seems to be bidding and its now the last hour of bidding. It looks like you might get it for a good price. Then Boub comes along and starts flashing banners across the front page of Ebay, saying &quot;Check out this Lounge suite, its going for a song. Dont miss out on a real bargain!&quot;. Now there are 6 or 7 extra bids and the bargain the guy had thought he was going to get evaporates into nothingness.<br />
To be honest, I dont have the time or energy that campers have, but i see their viewpoint. This site is much better when its just reporting industry news quickly and listing datamined items. When Boub starts doing is personal stuff like Professions moneymaking (and screwing multiple realms economies) and the above post, thats when the site is a turnoff.</div></div><hr />

I understand it, people think they are more entitled to something than others because they found out about it first, which is not true because the mobs weren't put in the game for them, I am sorry you don't get that. I enjoy the information that Boub posts, and I have no problem with never getting a rare mount, so this does not bother me at all, clearly it is bothering you, so I'd imagine you wished you had more time to 'win your bid' as opposed to dealing with the competition that comes with this information.</div></div><hr />

This is not the issue people have with this at all.<br />
<br />
The campers are unhappy because they went to the effort of finding all the information possible (when it was still rather scarce) to attain the mount because its what they enjoy doing in the game, and now others have just come to MMO, been spoon-fed a condensed version of all the info (wowhead is up to something like 900 posts about the mount) and are just chilling out waiting for their mount too.<br />

Tell that to a paralegal douchecanoe. The difference between a poor scrub lawyer and a successful one is how well they can find info. It is work to find such things... even in game.

This information was around for months, it's not new and it was never hard to find. People just had to type in &quot;cataclysm rares beta&quot; into google. The information was out before the game was released, I don't disagree that they may enjoy doing this and that's their thing, but they can still search around for their rares without reading this information and never knowing exactly where they are, if that is what they feel enhances their fun. If they were googling information about the rares before it was on MMO Champion, then chances are the looking part was not the motivation, they just wanted to get the rares before other people, which is also why most people are mad about this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im sorry, but how do you label this guy as a troll? Cause he doesn't agree with you? Or because he believes you and the others with pitchforks right now are going a bit overboard? Im sorry to tell you that's not what a troll is. Actually, the guy has some pretty good points.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm having troubles understanding here... What are you mad about? That more people know about the mount now? That was bound to happen anyways. By all this 'hardwork' BS that keeps getting thrown around, I wonder how any of you are entitled to it. By that argument, shouldn't only the first beta player to have ever seen it get first dibs and then have the mount removed from the game? He did all the hard work of stumbling across it. You all were spoon fed when he told his buddies that the rare was located there. That's all the argument from the people that are upset by this. Doesn't it seem a bit far fetched? Yah, pretty much.<br />
<br />
I knew about the mount before it was announced here. Why? cause I saw it on WoWhead. Did you blow up in the WoWhead forums spouting your anger that WoWhead has ruined it and its no longer a rare unknown mount cause its up for the world to see there? Or how about the hard work I put in hearing from a guildy on how helpful the npcscan is? Hell, my guildy must have ruined it for all you farmers for not keeping that addon a secret from me! I'll let him know next time I log how much he screwed up.<br />
<br />
TL/DR, Just please, shut it. The only thing annoucing it here did was possibly speed up the knowledge of the mount existing. Wich was going to happen anyways. Therefore, what you really are upset about is that you don't have more exclusive farming time for your own gain. Which, in turn can be labeled nothing else but greedy. Simple as it is. You want something for yourself while wanting to deny it for others. Plain and simple. Greedy. Now its open game for any that care about it. More fair now then ever.<br />
<br />
And your week of hard work? Are you serious? Drop in the bucket. If you think thats hard farming, you don't even have a clue. I have farmed Time lost for hours in Wrath. Hours and hours. Can only chalk it up to poor luck when someone got there before me. Not that they stole it from me and was un-deserving. Do you people even recognize your own argument?[COLOR=&quot;red&quot;]<br />

Get off your perch you haughty bag of too cool for school-whip.<br />
<br />
So, you are upset with WoWhead and all the other sites with information reporting about rare mounts as well? By the argument the majority of angry posters, it appears that you guys wish that none of this stuff ever was mentioned ever. You could only find it by chance, running into it in game (Also when you get it, be careful to never leak word on where you found it). That way, it truly is rare, and it actually was work finding a rare mob.<br />
<br />
Other wise, you are upset because you found information about a rare before someone else found information about a rare on a different site. Hypocrite much? Maybe WoWhead didn't make an announcement, but its still easy to find the information there. You didn't do any work unless you dove into the coding to find it. Otherwise, you put in just about the same amount of work and effort as someone that put in the work to visit this site.<br />
<br />
Calm down, your argument doesn't make sense. Just leave it up to as you lost your early exclusive advantage due to the game being out a week and people are becoming more aware. It was going to happen. It wasn't Boub's fault. It just happened faster then you would have liked. Don't worry, you'll live.</div></div><hr />

Doing your best to camp a rare mob is not that hard,but it requires a lot of patience and focus,and some stress on top.<br />
So I can understand that people are frustrated that now most random noobs who did no effort at all have the proper knowledge and tools to go after the drake.<br />

But on reflection? Those who are into this kind of thing will stay aound and camp, whereas the 'wrath babies' as some have called them, will lose interest pretty quickly, leaving the hardcore campers to camp in peace.<br />
<br />
Yes there is now a list of rares. <br />
Yes I want the Aeonaxx mount. <br />
Yes I camp for it.<br />
No, I don't care if someone else gets to him first (i may rage for a few minutes but thats all), because they were LUCKY, and thats all it comes down to in the end. LUCK, pure and simple.<br />

Personally couldn't care less for these specific mounts, much too busy raiding, but I do care about the whine by those who camped a whole whopping week (ever tried camping a mount for two years? No?), AMG, A WEEK!, and now suddenly feel they're the only ones with a right to the rare spawns. <br />

This site shouldn't post stuff like this on it. At ALL. You already screwed up Time-Lost Proto-Drake when you announced it.<br />
<br />
Please stick to posting important stuff about raids, dungeons, patches, et cetera. That's what you're good at.<br />
<br />
If people want information about rares, they gotta be &quot;in the know&quot;. Wowhead.com is great for that, because if they see a rare mob, or a mob/item w/ a special name, they can lookit up there, and the information is available to them. But now you're just handing it out.<br />
<br />
Lost a lot of points here. Would be nice to maybe unpost it. But damage was already done. You should post stuff that you really want so you have to fight through hordes of scrubs going after it, when they probly wouldn't know what to do with it in the first place.</div></div><hr />

But on reflection? Those who are into this kind of thing will stay aound and camp, whereas the 'wrath babies' as some have called them, will lose interest pretty quickly, leaving the hardcore campers to camp in peace.<br />
<br />
Yes there is now a list of rares. <br />
Yes I want the Aeonaxx mount. <br />
Yes I camp for it.<br />
No, I don't care if someone else gets to him first (i may rage for a few minutes but thats all), because they were LUCKY, and thats all it comes down to in the end. LUCK, pure and simple.<br />
Even if theres lots of people around the pats, think of the information on rares in the weeks after this!<br />
<br />
People are gonna camp it. The scrubs will go out there, expect to find it in a few minutes, and then get bored. Same thing happened with TLPD. It was camped like crazy, and then it was just meh. The hardcore and dedicated farmers will continue.<br />

This is coming from one of those people who probly didn't know anything about this, and was glad you read the front page news. You got what, like 10 mounts? Gratz. But, there's no way I can prove or disprove that, and same for you. But whatever. Gratz on being fed information that wasn't really need-to-know information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just because you found out about it from Wowhead instead of MMOchamp doesn't mean that you've put more towards it than others, regardless it's a rare spawn, people find out about it, whether you're the first or not, doesn't mean you deserve it over someone else, we all pay for the game, now quit your bitching.<br />
<br />
One thing mentioned a lot in these post's of tears is that some random, all thanks to some moderator, is going to fly down and &quot;take&quot; it from you, now for starters you don't know if the persons been camping or not, the chances of someone just popping in for 5 minutes, being there when the drake spawns AND getting it is some stupid chance that i'm not even going to attempt to work out.<br />
<br />
And shit people, all that was posted was it's name and that it &quot;apparently&quot; pats around the temple, now if you actually cared about this like you claim from your &quot;days of camping&quot; then you'd know other things such as approximate spawn rate, spawn location(s), flight path, stop bitching about something because people now have a lesser or equal to chance of getting the same thing you want, implying that you know that there all is to know about Aeonaxx.<br />

Its much easier than trying to configure NPCscan with every ID. That way you can leave it running while mining or herbing and when you pass across a rare it will alert you. Iv made about 2k gold with so far by finding a few rare mobs and selling loot.<br />

Or just use both since they use different detection methods.<br />

A few more than ten, actually, though I'm not a collector. I tend to only go for mounts I find really cool. But what a wonderful, logical thought process. Your parents must be proud. 'You must have not known11111!' I said *earlier in the thread*, it's so hard to do a WoWHead search for it, and I've been peeking around Deepholm for a few hours each day. Do you even -read-? Or only whine?<br />

The fact that 99% of you are crying about MMo-Champ &quot;spoonfeeding&quot; this info to people and undermining all your &quot;hardwork&quot; and &quot;research&quot; just makes all of your posts all the more laughable seeing as unless you killed Aeonaxx on Beta or found out about the mount all by yourself (no ingame or web help), you yourselves were &quot;spoonfed&quot; the infomation from another source... be it WowWiki, WowHead, Guildies or Friends who got it before you etc... thinking that 30secs of research or word of mouth makes you more worthy of this mount than people who saw it on here just proves that you really fail at life...<br />
<br />
I actually found out about this rare on beta... does that mean if i go online tonight and find 1 of you whiners and say &quot;i found out about it before you so you have to go away until i get it&quot; and you don't that makes you no better than the people you're all crying about right now?...<br />
<br />
As a beta tester i say anyone who found out about this mount after worldwide release has less rights to claim the mount than i do! (this is clearly a joke as i cba wasting my hard-earned wages sitting on the same spot for weeks)</div></div><hr />

Now every scrub and their mother will be camping this. These things are put in game to be rare and &quot;oh wow, I can't believe I found that&quot;.<br />
<br />
This site shouldn't post stuff like this on it. At ALL. You already screwed up Time-Lost Proto-Drake when you announced it.<br />
<br />
Please stick to posting important stuff about raids, dungeons, patches, et cetera. That's what you're good at.<br />
<br />
If people want information about rares, they gotta be &quot;in the know&quot;. Wowhead.com is great for that, because if they see a rare mob, or a mob/item w/ a special name, they can lookit up there, and the information is available to them. But now you're just handing it out.<br />
<br />
Lost a lot of points here. Would be nice to maybe unpost it. But damage was already done. You should post stuff that you really want so you have to fight through hordes of scrubs going after it, when they probly wouldn't know what to do with it in the first place.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is ridiculous. Posting it here is no different the the posting on WoWhead. People use WoWhead as a WoW resource site. People use this site as a WoW research site. You did just as much work as the person that visited this site to obtain information. I found out about this mount in WoWhead. Why arn't people raging that WoWhead has screwed over this rare mount? It was there first, announcing it to the world.<br />
<br />
All this anger is unjustified. Your arguments are flawed. Stop being greedy and selfish. Yes you don't have exclusive farming time anymore, so to speak. But these rares were already known by many. The rarity of this spawns aren't due to people not knowing about them. Its cause they seldom pop and its pure luck in being the first one to him. You could be camping there for a year straight without rest and still not be guaranteed that kill. Its luck. Its still luck.<br />
<br />
People that are raging are going to be dying at a early age of a stroke or heart attack if this is something to get so pissed about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once again, your effort is 5 minutes of googling unless you completely fail at web surfing. It takes me about as long as it does to hit my bookmark button for WoWhead and look up the rares as it does for me to click my bookmark for MMO champ and read the front page. If any of you think you put in effort in researching this mount, you either actually checked the code for specifics, or your effort isn't justified of this argument. How do you believe that your 5 minutes of a web search (something that is considered work now, what?) entitles you to something over another person when the original of intent of the rare/item is completely luck based is beyond me, and the fact that so many have this same view is scary to see how far broken people are.<br />
<br />
The mount is still in the game. Still has the same properties as before. Deepholme is a bottle neck in content and very many of the player base goes through there (82-84/shoulder mounts/and more...). Thing is, the chance of getting this mount negligibly changed due to this post. The only thing that you put forth that others may have not was not effort, but maybe initiative. I'll give you that. But even with that being the case, in my opinion, still does not entitle you to anything. You got your week and a half of less populated farming.<br />
<br />
And for the guy that posted before you. Sorry, completely wrong in your over generalization. The mobs are still rare. Nothing changed. Im fine with them talking about them on sites where they talk about WoW related stuff. Makes complete sense. That in consideration, I also like how Heroics are. No need of nerfs. People can down them, they are challenging and fun. People should put some effort in for their gear. (Effort = learning the fights. Practicing with others to smooth out co-operation. Effort in bettering yourself as a player. Thats great part of this game and shouldn't be lost to stupidly easy content. Effort does not = 5 minutes of google search). Bad comparison on your part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm &quot;Fairly&quot; sure NPCscan actually is more of a filter like program. As you probably know a lot of information is stored server side not on your computer. As you explore your computer downloads things like NPC tags etc. What I think NPCscan does is checks NPC tags as they come into your computer and are saved to your cache folder. If the NPC tag is a rare it will notify you.<br />
<br />
This is why you need to clear your cache folder every time u find a rare if you want to find it again because it can only &quot;find&quot; the NPC when it is being saved to the cache folder. This is also why NPC scan will falsely alert you (although quite often it will know it is incorrect) if a rare spawn pet is found as it has the same NPC tag as the NPC before it is tamed.</div></div><hr />

It was all over warcrafmounts.com since the beginning of cata.<br />
most ppl knew about the rare npcs before, they just cba to sit there camping them<br />
same thing with Timeles Proto tbh<br />
