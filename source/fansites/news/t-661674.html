She has lurked in her lair and done battle with the many brave adventurers who travelled to that familiar location over the years. Now, in honor of the World of Warcraft 5-year anniversary, the dreaded brood mother Onyxia is being revamped to make a return to the forefront of Azeroth, as part of our big plans for the upcoming 3.2.2 content patch.<br />
<br />
This permanent update to Onyxia will convert the dungeon into 10- and 25-player modes. We will be adding new items to Onyxia’s loot table that have the same model as some of the classic loot from this dungeon, like Tier 2 helms, with stats updated to match the current level of content. There will be a special new item too: a normal drake-sized 310% speed flying mount modeled after Onyxia herself called an Onyxia Broodling. We will also be updating the encounter mechanics to be more fitting for modern raiding, but we can guarantee players will get to experience the frightening horror of deep breaths once again.<br />
<br />
Then for a limited time, after the 5-year anniversary event officially begins in November, anybody who logs in will receive an Onyxia Brood Whelpling pet.<br />
<br />
We’re very excited to bring this classic encounter back to provide a fun new experience for both new and veteran players. Further details will be available in the near future, and we will be setting up the Public Test Realms soon to help test out this fight along with all the new content we have planned for the patch. Keep an eye on the forums for updates! <br />
<br />
Arena Matchmaking Changes<br />
There is currently a 2-minute queue time addition to play against a team you just played against (so, 2 minutes plus normal queue time to be matched against them). This time value was 5 minutes when 3.2 was first released, but was lowered to 2 minutes in a hotfix last Friday.<br />
<br />
The purpose of the time addition is to make it less likely that an average team doing arena games for a night isn't likely to run across the same team in many of their games for the session. We'll continue to tune the system to make sure that it doesn't feel like too much of a nuisance when there simply aren't other teams within a reasonable rating range to play against. <br />
<br />
3k Arena Rating Cap Removed<br />
In the case of a tie, all tied teams are awarded. However, the rating cap was removed in patch 3.2, so the 3k cap shouldn't be an issue for the end of the season. <br />
<br />
Design Intent of /castrandom Macros<br />
We allow players to use macros for convenience, especially when automating tasks that they do often. Where macros cross the line is when they are making the decision instead of the player. In the old-days, there were addons that would essentially target a player with a debuff and cure it. That crossed the line for us – the mod was playing the game instead of the player.<br />
<br />
In the /castrandom case, players were sometimes using these macros to cast the ability that wasn’t on cooldown without having to recognize this fact or hit the right button. Players using this system had an unfair advantage against players that weren’t. Instead of having to cope with the complexity built into the class, players could just spam one key and have the game “do the right thing.”<br />
<br />
We recognize that in some cases, certain classes are probably over complex or else the default WoW UI doesn’t provide the information you need in a form where you can quickly notice that say an ability has proc’d or another is on cooldown. In these cases, we would like to fix the class or UI problem, not require all of our players to use macros to get around the limitation. You can help us identify those situations where you feel overly-dependent on a /castrandom macro so we can start to address those problems.<br />
<br />
We also recognize that players sometimes used /castrandom for options that were truly random and with no gameplay consequence, such as picking a random polymorph animal, companion or mount. In these situations, we want to give you specific commands you can use to get the desired functionality. We have no problem with you rolling the dice in this manner. <br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
Experience in Battlegrounds Too Low?<br />
This is something we're watching very closely and right now we'd be inclined to agree that there are some battlegrounds where we may need to boost the amount of experience awarded. However, that isn't to say that all battlegrounds are less than they should be. Still, we are looking at adjusting the experience sometime in the near future. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19109958094-bg-xp-sucks.html))<br />
<br />
Balancing Arena Brackets<br />
The 2s bracket has two flaws built into its design. One is that it tends to select for those classes who have a lot of different options and utility built into one class. Since your team is just one other guy, and he or she is often going to be focused or CC'd, you can't rely so much on your teammate's abilities. You have to rely on your own abilities. What players kept asking for, and the direction we realized we were taking, was just to give more and more abilities to more and more classes so that everyone had everything. We don't think that's good for class design long term. Arena is intended to be about teamwork not self-sufficiency.<br />
<br />
The second problem is the relative balance of power of healing. If a healer can keep themselves and one other person alive in 2s, then they probably can't keep three people alive in 3s. That tends to squeeze healers out of 3s. On the other hand, if a healer can keep a three-player team alive, then they can probably keep a two-player team alive trivially.<br />
<br />
We didn't remove the 2s bracket from the game. If you like it, it's still there for you. But we wanted to be able to focus more of our balance effort on the 3s bracket and wanted more of the high-end potential gladiators to focus their balance feedback and effort on that bracket as well. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19110028011-is-3v3-and-5v5-any-more-balanced-than-2v2.html))<br />
<br />
Differences between Arena Brackets<br />
<br />
<br />
Think about it this way. We offer 10 and 25-player raids in the hopes that players who like smaller groups or larger groups can both find something that suits them. We could take that to extremes and also offer a 15-player raid or still offer 40-player raids too. But the more of these options we add, the more effort it takes to balance them all and the bigger chance that something will break at one of the extremes.<br />
<br />
We think 3s and 5s will ultimately offer a better play experience. But we have supported 2s for a few years now and some players have grown to enjoy them, so we thought it was overly harsh to just cut them from the game.

Buffing Arcane<br />
I said we wanted to buff Arcane but wanted to do so without adding back some of the fast burst damage that we have worked hard to reduce in PvP. We agree that it's worth changing things that can be really frustrating to play against even if it doesn't reward the other guy with high representation or ratings.

Glyph of Mind Flay<br />
I'm almost positive that the way it works is the glyph leaves a 10% snare on Mind Flay today on live (the glyph didn't change in 3.2). The reason is because we thought it might cause a lot of bugs related to whether a target was officially snared or not. A 10% snare isn't particularly useful but it is noticeable.<br />
<br />
What we're talking about is changing the glyph to not affect the default snare at all. The glyph would just boost range. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19110417500-glyph-of-mind-flay-slow-reduction-removed.html))<br />

Buffing Demonology<br />
The context was how do you find 3 distinct niches for a dps class such that each of the trees has its moment to feel special and shine yet over the course of a raid tier, all 3 feel like they do about the same dps. That's a really challenging goal.<br />
<br />
It wasn't a &quot;buff Demo&quot; discussion as much as what the roles should be for pure dps talent trees, unless you fall back on the classic &quot;PvP, PvE and the spec nobody takes.&quot;<br />
<br />
If we buffed Demonology, and we buffed it too much (even if it was only on some fights) then what you'd probably see is most raiding warlocks shift to Demo. This is exactly what happened when we made Survival better than Beastmaster. What does that really accomplish other than giving players whiplash and perhaps giving those players who really just love a certain spec a little bit of time in the sun? <br />
<br />
[...] I think Demonology has a lot of cool and useful abilities. It's pretty fun to level with. But players understandably get very focused on max potential dps, and Demo currently doesn't offer that.<br />
<br />
We're all for making fun trees, and just having the trees be fun is enough for a lot of players who aren't necessarily focused on end-game progression. But we recognize that a lot of players are focused on end-game progression, and at this day and age, even the players who aren't get bombarded by it.

Anyone remember having to do the questline/key process for her... if you dont your lucky, really lucky as a matter of fact. It was a PITA well in todays terms it wasnt nothing but back then, trying to get the people together that were either just starting out, or if you were unlucky having to find a group thats in the middle of the process was a even bigger PITA.<br />
<br />
Ok i got off topic, the fight at 60, was a pain, shes in the loosest terms i could prolly come up with is a b*tch. Still fun tho, and gettin a chance to dethrown her again after shes been revamp'd will be a pleasure.<br />

Who needs new bosses when you can re-farm old stuff!<br />
<br />
They should bring back the attunement quest line too, with a new Jailbreak! thats even buggier than the original.<br />
Though the whole black dragonflight lore gets ruined by this. they simply must make BWL into a 25 man raid so neferian can get equal treatment. Or just bring deathwing out.</div></div><hr />

Im presonally psyched as hell :D And Ony mount sounds nice - wonder if its going to be a 100 % drop, low % drop, limited time avaiable or what. 100 % drop sounds too good to be true :&gt; esp if its 310</div></div><hr />

But good going on blizzard's part though. It gets over half of their community to jizz in their collective pants over some retuned rehashed holiday loot pinata.

<br />
Seeing what they did to naxx u shouldnt get to excited, and ye i know there 2 diff level instances and i want to raid Onyxia again but its blizz were talking about.<br />
So expect recycled models from the old loot table pretty much every ability nerfed to do 10% dmg on max hp and the fear to be cut out totally from the fight. And hardmode will probably be kill her without getting hit by the tail.<br />
<br />
Also patch 3.3 will probably contain Gruul who will drop a awsome Gruul gronnling mount for those who want to be stalled for new exiting content.</div></div><hr />

I'm all for the Lore involving Onyxia being reworked into the current scheme of things.<br />

I'm not sure if you all are thinking what I am. But I see this as a possible lead-in for things to come in the expansion. <br />

<br />
I for one, actually welcome it, i can't wait to have my Judgment crown.<br />

This is what happens when over time, this boss is so easy, any class that can take hits and heal could solo it.<br />

Uh the only real reused content atm is Naxx, which they reused due to a very small percent getting to see it originally (I believe even less than the number of people who got to see Sunwell). They add one more encounter and it's going too far? Hm, I suggest you either stop complaining or just quit now.</div></div><hr />

With this information I think we can do some guesswork and get a pretty accurate idea of what this fight will be like.<br />
<br />
Trash:<br />
After zoning in, some dwarves will be gathered in the entry tunnel that snakes down to the lair of the Brood Mother. At the very bottom there will be some cannons set up, and speaking to one of the dwarves will start an event. Evidently, the dreadful black dragonflight has cut this group of dwarves off from some of their friends who are further down the tunnel, and we need to repel them as they try to destroy the dwarven supplies! <br />
<br />
Adds will pour down the hall and raiders will have to sit on turrets and destroy them until 15 waves have passed. There will only be 10 turrets so the other 15 raiders will have to collect ammunition and scrap metal to resupply and repair the turrets. <br />
<br />
Phase 1:<br />
After these waves are destroyed, you will reunite with the rest of the dwarves at the entrance to Ony's chamber. Luckily dwarven ingenuity has displayed itself again and they've managed to drill through the walls, bringing some siege vehicles with them! The raid will once again have access to siege engines and demolishers. <br />
<br />
The raid will rumble through the tunnel into her chamber and begin the fight. A siege engine is best to tank her, as they can time their shield cooldown to mitigate her massive breath damage. Demolishers will have to avoid getting breathed on at all costs! <br />
<br />
The vehicles will dps her until roughly 65%, when she will emote and begin phase 2.<br />
<br />
Phase 2:<br />
As the Brood Mother takes to the air, she emotes: &quot;Pesky mortals and your toys, let's see how you fight on your own!&quot; Suddenly a great blast of lava will melt all of the vehicles, and the players will be left on their own.<br />
<br />
But just as all hope appears to be lost, Alexstrasza and drakes of the red dragonflight will burst through the ceiling and begin to pick players up!<br />
<br />
The raid will need to allocate some players to keeping stacks of dots up on Onyxia as she flies about the room, and other players to dealing with the whelps that spawn from the caves to either side of the chamber. This phase ends at 40%, as Onyxia begins to land.<br />
<br />
Phase 3:<br />
Onyxia emotes as she again lands on the ground: &quot;Alexstrasza! What treachery is this!? BAH! You think your red dragonflight stands any chance HERE, IN MY SANCTUM!?&quot; <br />
<br />
Suddenly the chamber begins to shake, and rocks begin falling from the sky, killing red drakes left and right. Once again, the raid is left on their feet in the middle of her floor.<br />
<br />
Just when Onyxia is about to finish the brave raiders once and for all, Thrall (Or Varian Wyrnn for Alliance raids) rides into the chamber on a wolf or steed respectively. <br />
<br />
He emotes: &quot;SHE DRAGON, YOUR REIGN OF TERROR HAS LASTED FAR TOO LONG. LET US RID THE WORLD OF YOUR FILTH ONCE AND FOR ALL! AND LET US SEE YOUR TRUE FORM!&quot; <br />
<br />
Onyxia responds: &quot;NO, NO, IT CAN'T BE!&quot; <br />
<br />
Onyxia begins to shake violently and smoke fills the room. When the dust clears, she is left in her human form.<br />
<br />
She emotes: &quot;Fools, you think I am any less potent in this body? BWAAH, YOU UNDERESTIMATE THE BLACK DRAGONFLIGHT!&quot; <br />
<br />
Suddenly human adds begin to pour out of the whelp caves riding black steeds and wielding jousting lances! <br />
<br />
Thrall screams for assistance, and dozens of wolves and horses begin to pour into the chamber. Players equip their jousting lances and jump aboard the mounts. Onyxia must be attacked with shield break 300 times to get rid of all of her stacks, and players will need to chain taunt her to make sure she is always tanked by someone with 3 stacks of shield block. <br />
<br />
This is the last phase, the fight ends when Onyxia hits 2%, as she becomes converted and will most likely help the raiders in the upcoming Icecrown Citadel content patch. <br />
<br />
<br />
The end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a game. You complain about a dragon, having already been officially &quot;killed&quot; yet you forget one rather important fact.<br />
<br />
YOU CAN KILL HER EVERY WEEK RIGHT NOW. She's probably already been killed, since release, about a bazillion times. (inb4 &quot;OVER 9000!!!!!!&quot; )<br />
<br />
Yes, they re-tuned Naxxfarmus to level 80. Yes, it sucked more than a $10 hooker.<br />
<br />
Personally, I will enjoy the newer Onyxia. I'd rather it was a 10/25man than a 40man like in Pre-TBC. What I've heard from many a person who played then; is that 40mans were really 20 people doing what they were supposed to do and 20 other people afk for porn or picking their nose in the corner.<br />
<br />
I think there is already enough of that going on.</div></div><hr />

people can QQ about EVERYTHING... people like you are never happy about anything blizzard does to this game, why don't you just fucking quit and leave us alone with your QQ ?<br />

Sorry to enrage you so much fanboy, but I was around during the time onyxia was end game content, and I dont really want to go back there. I want to see brand new content, new models, new textures, this just seems like the ultimate lazy. They dont need to make new textures, no new models, same armor, same onyxia. What is there to be excited about? Where's the big lead up to Arthas?<br />

If you really cant wait to see Onyxia, go visit her in her lair now. :)</div></div><hr />

Listnen here, this is a minor patch, this is just a little BONUS to celebrate WoW's 5th anniversary, nothing more, nothing less.<br />
<br />
And I was there aswell when Onyxia was fresh content(FUCK YOU JAILBREAK, FUCK YOU)<br />
<br />
And I indeed visited her today, beat the crap out of her, and sold the helmets that dropped(Bloodfang, Judgement) for a whopping 8g a piece.<br />
<br />

And now they add an old encounter with tweaked numbers (life, damage etc) and call it a day. This game needs some big content patches soon. And no recycled crap. We pay over 120 million euros every month and they feed us some 4 years old encounter a second time. This is rich...and you brainwashed monkeys welcome it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah cause Ony was sooooooo hard in Vanilla...<br />

Always been an interesting fight, frustrating at times,,.. hope they do a bugfix on her before changing the fight. As solo/duoing her has often led to some very inexplicable results.</div></div><hr />

These people are so extremely lazy and they realized that they have no game content in their backhand. Look at colliseum. People had cleared it already if blizz wouldnt keep the raids back with this you have to wait 5 weeks before you can gib the real stuff. And now they add an old encounter with tweaked numbers (life, damage etc) and call it a day. This game needs some big content patches soon. And no recycled crap. We pay over 120 million euros every month and they feed us some 4 years old encounter a second time. This is rich...and you brainwashed monkeys welcome it.<br />

<br />
You think -this- is lazy... for 3.2.2, a minor content patch, and as a gift for their 5th year anniversary when all we got last year was a polar bear pet in the mail?<br />

You want big content patches? Well, there was 3.0, expansion and 3.1. 3.2 being meh. 3.3 will bring IC.<br />

I enjoyed kicking Ony's ass every week or so, and the fact that I get to do it again just makes me even happier. There always seems to be that group of people that bitches when they attempt to make veteran players happy by bringing back an old raid that was quite fun, while in the mean time providing a new experience for newer players :P Regardless, I'm going to enjoy it.

Picky about item names too; Judgement helm sounds cooler than Valorous/Conqueror's Judgement helm.<br />
<br />
Onyxia was fun because you went with 39 other people and got deep breathed and you were in and out in like 40 minutes after people got their loot, head, and in some cases quest weapons and to this day nobody knows what activates that deep breath.<br />
<br />
So going in with 24 others may be cool, but 10 man is totally going to blow cookies.<br />

Blizzard needs to remember that through adversity and challenge comes reward. Adversity is not normal mode Deconstructor. Adversity is not the butchered version of Naxx. Adversity is M'uru pre-nerf, Kael 25 man, and Vael.<br />

I can't really say it's exactly fair to assume that means Onyxia10 will be easy mode. After all, Blizzard could be doing this and make it a fight people actually need to do their best in. <br />
But she's pretty much easy mode at 80 already. You could think of this as a buff to her power.=P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know, but the amount of effort put into killing a raid boss should scale, obviously. A level 60 boss killed by 40 level 60s should translate into 25 80s killing a level 80 raid boss with the same amount of effort invested (not counting raid mats, etc).<br />
<br />
If I experience the same amount of adversity killing Onyxia at 80 as I did at 60 then this feature will be a success. But I do hope that they don't take the 60 version away for those people still at 60.<br />

<br />
My concern is that if this turns into a series of revamps that allows a level 80 version of T2 to be had that everyone will be running around wearing level 80 &quot;valorous/conqueror/heroes&quot; T2.<br />
<br />
T2 was cool because not a lot of people had any piece of it (let alone a full set) and it looked great.</div></div><hr />

Re-living former glories, fighting bosses that virtually everybody already knows the strategy for. It's something &quot;new&quot; I suppose but it doesn't beat original and challenging content, and it diminishes the &quot;story&quot; of WoW for any people interested in that sort of thing.<br />

Just means Icecrown is farther away than we thought and 310 percent mounts are meaningless. Rusted proto just meant you actually are a competent raider. Now an ony one just means you got good dice. But good going on blizzard's part though. It gets over half of their community to jizz in their collective pants over some retuned rehashed holiday loot pinata. While the devs high five each other on top of the pile of money they saved from doing nothing new at all and call it &quot;content&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Facerollable? How do you know? Have you seen how they will remake it?<br />
Ofcourse it's far away, it's the grand fucking finale of the expansionpack, they're gonna make it huge and thusly they need a lot of time for it. I bet you they have been designing the Icecrown raid for a long time already.<br />

A big chunk of players have been calling for old content to be re-implemented, and as soon as it is, here come the accusations of laziness and claims that our precious memories of old school raiding experiences will be compromised, not to mention that vanishingly tiny niche of players who raid the old content at level 60 (what do these people do about talents? Do they pretend the trees stop at the 31 pointer? How far does the hypocrisy extend?).<br />
<br />
I think it just demonstrates that WoW is vast and serves a diverse player-base, and almost any decision is going to be embraced by some and abhorred by others. And there will always be those who resist any kind of change, especially to things that they can reflect on through the rose-tinted lenses of their nostalgia, and especially to things which might compromise our elite exclusivity in having participated in those events the first time, the way it was meant to be, back when WoW was hard and before it started catering to all these noobs.<br />
<br />
Also, what's with all the people pointing out the logical fallacy in killing a raid boss more than once? That was the case back when Onyxia was cutting edge raid content, that has been the case every few days since the release of TBC, it is the case for every raid at the moment and it is the case for any non-heroic 5-man that you cavalierly reset. You may as well ask how it is that so-called &quot;mages&quot; are able to summon fire with their bare hands, how realistic is that?</div></div><hr />

Oh, yeah, and wasn't Onyxia part of that whole memories thing, too?

That's where it goes wrong tho... people didn't ask for old content to be re-implemented... people asked for old content to return... the quality back then was alot better<br />
<br />
We're now in a time where nothing you do in wow is exclusive anymore... even the hardmode achievements are laughable at best. Sure ofc you feel the thrill of &quot;jay we did a hardmode&quot; ... but nothing is as epic as it used to feel when you put days in 1 boss. That feeling is fully gone... now people don't look at the raid encounter anymore when a new instance is released, they look at the lootlist to see what easymode epics they can get this time.<br />
<br />
Blizz truely sh*t us over with WoW and it's going too far now. I myself am truely longing for a new MMO to take the stand with dev's who aren't as stuck up as the Blizz devs.</div></div><hr />

This is not what I hoped for when I though about old content being reimplemented. No.<br />
<br />
This is just fucking lame.<br />
<br />
I understand that some of you might be happy with this, but those who have done it, please remember how it was. Now. Think about PuG'ing it. <br />

How does it feel? I bet it feels really good now, huh? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalundu</div><div class="date">2009-08-13, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This. Before when a new instance came out no one even mentioned the loot, that wasn't the point. All the talk was about the encounters, what bosses did and what was the best way to defeat them. Now that part of raiding has been trivialized so much that people completely skip over boss strategies and go straight to the loot tables.<br />
<br />
Why are encounters like Onyxia remembered with such fondness? People don't look back and say &quot;Remember Onyxia? That Shard of the Scale was sure great!&quot; They look back and say &quot;Remember Onyxia? Wth was with Deep Breath anyways?&quot;. The entire reason that Onyxia was loved had absolutely nothing to do with what she dropped. If she receives the WotLK treatment sure it will be the same graphics, script and names, but the most important part of the encounter will be completely removed.<br />
Hell, even look at the loot. That sword quest involving Onyxia, people don't really remember the actual sword nearly as much as they remember what had to be done to get it.<br />

<br />
Upgrading her takes very little effort so it won't slow down the progress of making other fresh instances,<br />
4-5 people can do this<br />
I mean, how hard can it be to upgrade her health and loot table?<br />
This is just a bonus, for us, enjoy it...<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly. People crying over this have quite different issues then Onyxia, if you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
It's like the boss coming into the office, stating that due to a little fortune and i.e. he will be celebrating a wedding, he can and wants to give everyone in the office a paid day off. Now would you see people complaining that instead of doing 'such a lazy thing' he should rather spend this little extra money and his time on new office furniture or better lighting ?<br />
<br />
Some people are fucking dumb.</div></div><hr />

Since you are using the past as an example: My grandfather has epic memories of the second world war, a life without TV and shitting in a bush outside in the winter because there was no toilets in houses. I still don't need that time back.<br />
<br />
I also have my memories of Onyxia (the corpserun was also epic..across the whole of fcking DWM if you were Horde). Another epic memory was 11 weeks of kills without a warock T2 head. Point being? things change and you can't please everyone. Please do not PuG and kill her if it soils your precious memories ^^</div></div><hr />

Read my edit, and you'll see I've seen plenty of action in WoW:Vanilla myself good Sir. <br />

But unlike you I realize that when I bought my new car, it will be rendered obsolete on a day somewhere in the near distant future. Now a new model of the car will be produced but obviously it will never have the magic and appeal of the first model.<br />

The word for that feeling is called 'nostalgia', and like a ton of other different emotions, it only clouds one's judgment on things.<br />

current ulduar is far more interesting and with more entertainment value than the old dungeons ...<br />

the thing with onyxia is just ..it has been a main-raid-dungeon for those that made the game grow .. and now they want to have it redone for the next generations that never had this fight on the intended level ...<br />

<br />
The point about people QQing about the return of old content is aimed at those accusing Blizzard of laziness and reusing models and all that stuff. There is a whole bunch of players who would love to see the old content re-implemented suitably for the new level cap. There is a separate bunch of players who would regard this as &quot;cheating&quot; and artificially and lazily inflating content. It's this irreconcilable conflict to which I was referring.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is in fact putting more effort into this than just putting in the old challenges, it seems, if they're balancing it for 10-man and 25-man and making it &quot;more suited to modern raiding&quot;. Not to mention hard modes and achievements and so on. So, yeah, you might have a different gripe, but I wasn't talking about that one, I was talking about people accusing Blizzard of being lazy with their content.</div></div><hr />

Even if they screw up the difficulty level, it will be aprox the same to us as the 60 man is now, aka no change other than improved loot and an excuse to go visit her again. if they get the difficulty right, so much the better! Unlike Naxx where doing the old instance as 40 level 70s was actually way harder than doing the current one with the amount of people and level it was bloody tuned for!<br />
<br />
Also, in the entire &quot;you dont remember how much those instances sucked&quot; you are forgetting that what made those instances memorable and enjoyable wasnt only the fight mechanics (which are still better executed than some of the crap we have today), but the visual and narrative execution of them. Those instances actually felt like they fitted into wow, you were off fighting big space robots that seem like they accidentaly walked into the wrong game, you dont run around in what could be taken out of star trek or something the like, you arent farming trash mobs in a fucking arena that makes no sense! What made Onyxia epic was the feeling of epicness, which also helped invoke a sense of danger, something that wasnt present in most of the instances, simply because they strayed too far from what felt believable. <br />
<br />
also, we dont know how the new fight will looks since they seem to hint it will be changed a little, hopefully not too much. But its a nice trip down memory lane, and i would much rather do that than fight another thing they pulled out their arse, refreshing to actually get to kill warcrafty stuff for once.<br />
<br />
The instance i really want back however is a tier 10 tuned BWL, which i would say in terms of both the fights and the visual and storywise execution of the dungeon, ranks as one of the best they have ever made (and no, im not counting 3 drakes as actual bosses :P). Only problem being that since raiders today are absolute incompetent, clueless newbies, since they havent been given a chance to learn JACK (not your fault, blizzard's for making the instances too easy) they would completely freak out on some of the fight mechanics in there.</div></div><hr />

Onyxia's total health reduced 30%<br />
Onyxia will spawn fewer adds<br />

<br />
Though, I did not have only MC in mind. <br />
<br />
You can't say BWL was a bore.<br />
<br />
Ahn'Qiraj.<br />
<br />
Didn't do Naxxramas, so I can't say anything 'bout it, but from what I heard it was a shitload of epicness. <br />
<br />
<br />
Keke, you make it sound as if you were a robot who decided to delete emotions 'cuz they're nothing but a pain. :-P<br />
<br />
Dunno man, I woke up, and just found something terribly annoying. <br />
<br />
Don't take it personally, I don't have anything towards you, I'm just bloody annoyed. &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Well I can bloody say BWL was boring... Seriously, with fun mechanics like<br />
&quot;Stand in one place while your raid leader stares at Threatmeter and tells each of the tanks when they need to taunt the boss, while the most exciting thing for everyone else is when they get to run off into a corner and blow up&quot;<br />
&quot;Hide under a ledge while raid members drag mobs to the raid halfway across the instance&quot; and occasionally the thrilling &quot;Hibernate one of the dragon mobs while everyone else is killing the rest downstairs, then jump down and join the raid&quot; WooooO!<br />
&quot;Stand in one place and repeatedly heal the MT/OTs through mortal strike&quot;<br />
&quot;Stand in one place and heal the MT through a crack in the door and then move veeeeeery slightly so that you stop getting hit by the shadowflame&quot;<br />
&quot;Stand in one place and heal the MT and OT while they sit in a corner beating on a dragon and trading aggro&quot;<br />
&quot;Stand in one place and heal everyone while Hunters cast Tranquilising Shot&quot;<br />
&quot;Ooooh, mobs are only vulnerable to one school of magic! Everyone shout out on TS which one it is and watch half the Raid's DPS plummet because they're fire not frost!&quot;<br />
&quot;Stand in one place and repeatedly hit your decurse button&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll give you Razorgore as an interesting mechanic, and Class Calls on Nefarian were something different. The Supression Rooms were quite interesting, but only the first time you did them, thereafter they were annoying as hell. BWL was interesting for tanks and pretty much nobody else. It was about managing threat and line of sight- if Blizzard introduced another raid instance that was so heavily threat and positioning based they'd have a riot on their hands... Seriously, there's so much rose-tinting in WOW boards, I reckon either people never set foot in BWL or have serious underlying memory damage. The encounters in any WOTLK Raid dungeon are infinitely more varied and complex, particularly in Hard Modes, than anything inside BWL. Naxx mechanics weren't that complicated either as we can see from WOTLK where we have the same mechanics- the issue with Naxx was the balancing in Vanilla was insane, and the gear requirements were so retarded, that you had to be grinding 40 hours a week for gear just to have a chance of surviving the encounters.<br />
<br />
People really don't have a clue how far this game has progressed from Vanilla. By all means criticise WOTLK vs TBC, but there's no comparison when it comes to WOTLK vs Vanilla.<br />
<br />
Oh, and on topic- bringing back Ony is awesome. She's an iconic boss, and a means to introduce a whole new generation of WOW players to the crazy -50DKP raid leader vid- first ever wow vid I watched and nearly wet myself laughing...</div></div><hr />

The things is they're not marketing this as a new encounter. They're giving us this as a bonus to celebrate 5 years of WoW.<br />
<br />
It's a BONUS. Normally you wouldn't have gotten any new encounters in 3.2.2. You should be happy.<br />

Bring on Onyxia, she's possibly my favourite Boss in the game. I never played classic and so all the Classic bosses have such mystery and a touch of Elitism about them. Yeah I've gone back and 2manned the ol' girl but damn, experiencing her fight at 80 would be awesome. Please don't let this one be a joke (say like the Alliance getting Worgen :P).

<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets be honest here they are doing this to celebrate WoW's 5th anniversary, since onyxia has been there from the start I don't see any problem at all in them revamping the encounter for those of us who did play back in the day. I think anyway its nice being able to revisit old content without it being left for dead, especially for the people who didn't get to experience old world content because they came to the game at a later date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So yeah you may get your judgment crown or maybe even a bloodfang hood but I'm fairly confident that the armor model is gonna be the trashy T9 skin they just wont tolerate people not looking identical. A little different color pallet between difficulty settings is about as far as you can go in the &quot;individuality&quot; gear setting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc2222b8def1</div><div class="date">2009-08-13, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">one of the greatest problems I think is that no one really wants a challenge anymore<br />
a friend of mine was told her dps (roughly 4000) wasnt enough for heroic dungeons...<br />
Yesterday I wasnt invited to a Naxxramas 25-man raid because they only wanted people with 4000+dps<br />
<br />
cc is dead... you pick some people who are well equipped and the run will be quite easy<br />
<br />
its not blizzards fault that players have that attitude<br />
you want a challenge? do Naxxramas with players who do about 1800-2000 dps <br />
do ulduar 10 with players that are naxxramas 10 equipped<br />
<br />
take along players who dont know the raid... work with them instead of flaming them when they do something wrong<br />
hell dont check out the encounters on PTR so you can do it nearly perfect once the patch goes alive<br />
<br />
u could even go with a group where NOBODY knows the boss encounters and is barely well-enough-geared <br />
work yourself through every boss WITHOUT checking strategies on webpages<br />
try to beat the boss on your own... work out a strategy<br />
<br />
Dont cry for challenges and avoid those who are already in the game<br />
Dont whine for the game being to easy when you want to have it as easy as it can be<br />
<br />
as for the onyxia encounter... I understand a lot of people have nostalgic memories but Vanilla was dead the day TBC arrived<br />
of course people do the old content not only vanilla but also TBC but you cant compare that: its no real challenge<br />
<br />
I understand why classic raid guilds have a problem with this change but come on... how many years do u want to keep on playing the classic content? its nearly 5 years old<br />
<br />
I myself enjoy old games that I used to play when I was younger once in a while (Zelda, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear)<br />
but its an online game... seriously how long can u really enjoy the same content over and over AGAIN<br />
you cant expect Blizzard to pay that much attention to classic content, most of the WoW Players play the current content<br />
<br />
so if u think Blizz is destroying WoW because they make dead content more attractive to players who are already 80... quit the game... and if you already did that... fine. WoW isnt your game anymore... Vanilla is over</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're trying to save Onyxia from a old 40-man raid group and change the history again? :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoce6efcd64c7</div><div class="date">2009-08-13, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are so happy you registered to tell us this.<br />
<br />
To sum it up:<br />
<br />
What others aid to this: It is a celebration of the 5 year even, no new content. But I expected a post like yours. Now where is the QQ about a free pet? Can't have free pets. Need an attunement and a long questchain that includes soloing all old 40 man raids. And no bads, scrubs casuals or ppl with different DNA than me are allowed to have it....<br />
<br />
::)<br />
<br />
<br />
It was not my intention to &quot;QQ&quot;, all I wanted to do is to (Like everyone else here) share my thoughts on this. Why cant I share my thoughts just as you do? Because I recently became a member of a site I have been using for a long time? oh please... I did missunderstand the part where it was just a event for a few days, yes. But I still recent the idea of blizzard doing this even if it is just for a few days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well i guess it´s ok for newer players who didn´t play since vanilla.</div></div><hr />
