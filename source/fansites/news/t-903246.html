The Firelands: Lord Rhyolith &amp; Baleroc<br />
Blizzard updated their preview of the Firelands and added 2 bosses screenshots. Interestingly enough, Lord Anthrycist lost his controversial-weird name and is now named Ryolith. <br />
Hey all,<br />
<br />
We've added new images for Lord Rhyolith and Baleroc [The Gatekeeper] to our patch 4.2 preview of the Firelands.<br />
<br />
You can check them out here: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2682944<br />

Raid Mechanics and making them more transparent<br />
Even so, it's not unreasonable for a player to feel that some of the game mechanics in World of Warcraft could be made more transparent, be that through additional interface options, better encounter alerts, or a type of in-game guide. That may not be the exact complaint here, but it's still valid and worthy of consideration.<br />
<br />
In fact, we agree that there's room for improvement. As already mentioned, we're introducing the Dungeon Journal in patch 4.2. While this new feature won’t completely eliminate the need for one to &quot;study&quot; certain encounters, it should make it easier for players to pick up new fights, and hopefully a lot more fun (the journal looks pretty darn sweet, if you ask me, and even includes a little lore, too).<br />
<br />
Speaking to the future, we're also looking into ways that we can incorporate some &quot;raid/dungeon&quot;-style gameplay into solo environments. To a small degree, there's a bit of this in the new daily quest hubs coming up in in 4.2. While the goal isn't specifically to prepare players for dungeons and raids -- rather, just to make content that's fun and cool -- the quests themselves and some their related achievements encourage the use of tactics that you'd might see in dungeon and raid encounters.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Burn Victims&quot; is a &quot;heal the wounded NPCs in the field&quot; type of quest, which will give players a salve to use on burn victims in the Molten Front. Healers will be able to use their healing spells, however, and complete the quest much more easily (since most heals are ranged).<br />
<br />
&quot;Strike at the Heart&quot; is a quest with randomized bosses, all of which have raid-style environmental damage. There's even an achievement (currently named &quot;Ready for Raiding II&quot;) for killing all five of those random bosses without taking damage from their avoidable environmental effects.<br />
<br />
Some other achievements in the areas promote more skilled, &quot;raid-style&quot; play, too. &quot;Flawless Victory,&quot; for example, asks players to solo kill a Molten Behemoth (found in the Molten Front) without taking any damage from two its abilities: Molten Stop and Fiery Boulder. And &quot;Master of the Molten Front&quot; requires players to kill a variety of flamewakers in arguably non-standard ways (e.g. pwning a Flamewaker Shaman with his own Flamewave).<br />
<br />
<br />
Although these quests won't magically turn an inexperienced raider into an experienced one, we think they have the chance to make the daily content more interesting, as well as provide more opportunities for players to familiarize themselves with the style of gameplay one can expect within a dungeon or raid.

No...it didn't.<br />
<br />
After the first 2 months of &quot;oh my god 40 man raids!&quot; the novelty wore off VERY, VERY quickly and the palette of black/grey/red/orange got extraordinarily old. I feel a bit sick just thinking about it.<br />
<br />
Every single object and mob in there was a fire themed mob, how the hell was that not &quot;ramming it down our throats&quot; ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
not sure if serious... and you havn't stepped in BWL? The whole place had a red/black theme as well straight after doing MC. Besides, MC was the first real raid for WoW and it didn't really get tiring much because it took players months to clear and not a whole lot of guilds even got to ragnaros or even killed him in Vanilla.</div></div><hr />

I find it shocking that Firelands would have the theme of fire and molten rock.<br />
<br />
(PS: You can't use Molten Core as a reference for any comparison because half the bosses were the same goddamn model!)<br />
<br />
<br />
[...] Besides, MC was the first real raid for WoW and it didn't really get tiring much [...]<br />
There's a reason it was called Molten Chore by people back in the day. It was a tedious raid that you were forced to run for T2 pants and legendaries even if you were clearing BWL or higher.</div></div><hr />

Gatekeeper is sexy even if he uses the same skeleton as a doomguard.<br />
Molten giants look exactly like mountain giants cause they are... Asking for a molten giant that doesn't look like the other giants is like asking for a gryphon that doesn't look like an eagle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anthrycist only looks like &quot;Antichrist&quot; if you're nigh-on illiterate. I know many WoW players sometimes appear illiterate from the way they type in public chat channels, but I doubt most of them are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;<br />
&quot;Burn Victims&quot; is a &quot;heal the wounded NPCs in the field&quot; type of quest, which will give players a salve to use on burn victims in the Molten Front. Healers will be able to use their healing spells, however, and complete the quest much more easily (since most heals are ranged).&quot;<br />
<br />
Shoop da woop! :D Sounds awesome! (For me as a healer anyway!) :3<br />
<br />
Sounds like the alliance quest were you need to heal, save, and poke birds with stick (in twilight highlands).</div></div><hr />

You don't know what you're talking about. I do get that the percentage you threw out there is obvious exaggeration, but there are PLENTY of people entering old raids. For achievements, RP gear, just so see the famous lore characters.. You name it. There are ALWAYS people going to the old raids.</div></div><hr />

Consider the actual bosses, several are humanoids without a bit of fire/lava attached to them and the environment was a blend of caves as well as lava rivers.

The difference is this: The Molten Core was a Lava filled cave, fair enough. A natural place for Fire Elementals to gather in Azeroth, but we're talking about The Elemental Plane of Fire here. If you read the original descriptions of the Elemental planes from the RPG, they have actually toned it down a bit for the game.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Black Temple&quot; is not a dungeon. It's a raid instance.<br />
<br />
Also, I may not have been in every dungeon from that expansion, but the &quot;TBC&quot; dungeons I have visited were linear, a few examples are the ones you can find in the first zone Hellfire Peninsula. Don't fool yourself.</div></div><hr />

I could just be getting desensitized to the whole raiding thing, but I remember feeling like you were actually making your way through a dungeon or some crazy mountain hideout - now it's: left boss, right boss, straight ahead boss, win. Hell ToC didn't even have turns to take. They may not have had a supposed 11-12mil subscribers towards the end of vanilla, but that didn't seem to stop them from making things more intricate when they designed late vanilla raids and BC.</div></div><hr />
