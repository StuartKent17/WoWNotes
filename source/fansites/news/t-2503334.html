Due to very high demand, we will open a new WoW Classic realm for name reservations at 5:00 p.m PDT (8:00 p.m. EDT) today, Wednesday, August 14:<br />
<br />
Stalagg – PvP – Eastern Time<br />
<br />
We suggest that players, especially those on the Herod realm, consider creating characters on Stalagg. We expect that other PvP realms in this region will otherwise experience significant login queues when Classic launches.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />
<br />
Extended Queues Expected on Select Realms<br />
As of now, a large number of WoW Classic characters have been created on the following realms. Players with characters on this realm are likely to experience severe queues at release.<br />
<br />
<br />
Herod - PvP<br />
Whitemane - PvP<br />
<br />
<br />
We have updated the algorithm for the realm population tags so they more accurately reflect the expected population for that realm. The realms that are listed as “Full” are where we expect to see extended queues. If you’re concerned about long queue times affecting your play experience, you may want to consider creating characters on a lower population realm before the game releases on August 26 at 3:00 p.m. PDT.</div></div><hr />

That queue was probably only a a couple hundred (compared to the thousands from WotLK, or, the 10s of thousands for Classic), or under. For 8.2. And probably only on a few very specific realms. Illidan, Area-52 and Stormrage. lolol</div></div><hr />

MoP and WoD had massive queues. I remember waiting for hours when these expacs launched.<br />
<br />
Legion and BfA kinda stopped having queues, because Blizzard was more prepared and there's a shitton of servers. I actually had a queue too in 8.2 of a couple hundred players, but I got through after like 1 min.<br />
<br />
Also the classic realms probably won't have huge queues either when classic launches. Blizzard probably didn't expect that this many players would login during the first hour of the name reservations so they didn't allocate a lot of &quot;power&quot;</div></div><hr />

he made a toon on every realm, and will on this new one too.<br />
<br />
But his main is on Faerlina with his streamer friends.<br />
<br />
I'd expect herod to be the horde toon for them though, not a big deal /shrug.<br />

Because high population on a game that's not out yet means it will stay populated, every pre order game in existance says Hi, No man's sky says Hi.<br />

Don't be a naive child. Early high numbers doesn't mean long term numbers.<br />

I have to queue every day to play FFXIV. Admittedly it's only a queue of about 20-40 people and takes only a couple minutes, but still. It's nice in a way, shows the game is popular.<br />
<br />
These ignorant kids. ACTUALLY it means the MMO is dead which it is and everyone plays on the highest populated server so there's ques. Which is exactly what it is on that game. <br />
It would be like if wow died in 10 years, everyone on US would move to Illidan because it'd still be the highest populated server and then stupid posts &quot;Illidan has que times so the game is still popular!!! durrr&quot;<br />
I get que times logging into Blade and soul still and that game is dead as shit</div></div><hr />

This post only show they misscalculated the amount of pvp vs pve players that was coming, and the underestimated the amount of pvp players and had to set up another since they couldn't change already existing pve servers people made characters on. So we gonna have empty pve servers and full pvp servers, which makes sense, seeing how pvp is a large part of the endgame, not much else to do<br />
The fact that blizzard only put up 24, 25 servers total world wide, based on actual solid data from the stress tests and hype etc. with max capacity of what, 250 000 players total. Its safe to assume it has been over hyped a lot by a lot of the classic fanatics and not nearly as popular as people think, and what he said is infact not so far from the truth. Does it show the whole picture? no. But its rather good indications</div></div><hr />

The correct spelling of the word is 'queue'.<br />

OT: Why is everyone always fighting about this? I hope Classic gets a healthy population on their servers, so people who like to play it, can enjoy it. I hope the same for BfA. There is no reason for one to die so the other can thrive, they can exist together and people can enjoy both or one of them.</div></div><hr />

Exacly what I think, Classic world of warcraft will get stronger and better thanks to current World of warcraft and current world of warcraft will become stronger then better thanks to classic...<br />
<br />
Insted of hate... see them both as Warcraft legs that our legacy can stand on and grow stronger!<br />
<br />
PS: people can say what they want... but Classic has such a drive... current World of warcraft has none of my real life friend play it.... but clasic has all of them comming back, over 8 people are comming back to classic... and none of them even care about current World of Warcraft... that has to be sign (If this happens to me.... it has to happen all around the world)</div></div><hr />

If it follows the pattern that happened in Classic.

Yeah but it all depends on what drew the players to that server in the first place. Herod has Asmongold. If he leaves that server or plays something that isn't classic. That server is screwed. He is the entire reason that server has so many players.<br />
<br />
If you have players who genuinely want to play classic just for the experience on a server without streamers then you have a larger chance they'll stay for the gameplay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really.<br />
<br />
If anything, the previous situation that occurred back in Classic, BC, and Wrath will just happen again. It is nothing to do with gameplay, but more with ego and such. People wanted to be top dog, realised they were just one among many, or felt there was an imbalance in faction so they rolled the other faction, and it just snowballed from there.<br />
Heck, I recall in Laughing Skull EU, it was about 10 Horde to 1 Alliance, and during Wrath, the Horde had cleared Naxx multiple times, but Alliance had barely even got a group together, let alone cleared, mainly due to sheer volume of ganking occuring during questing.<br />
What happened? Alliance either switched, or stopped playing, and then because there was no WPvP, the Horde stopped playing also. Utter ghost-town caused by the very *community* they claimed was the greatest during WoW.<br />
<br />
Same thing occurred on most PvP servers, the community is its own worst enemy, and causes most of the issues. With the shittier mentality of most people on the net now? I fail to see how it will be any different.</div></div><hr />

One of the biggest requests FOR modern wow, actually, is a mega server or HUGE server crunch because we have 90% dead realms, and a handful where everyone is transferring to. When everyone starts piling up on a few realms; it's a sign of a games decline.<br />

Nothing you said there counters the point i made. If retail suddenly condensed all the servers to 12, there would be assuredly be queues on all of them. No question asked, but instead retail is spread across 226 US realms. When you are funneling all the players to 226 realms vs all the players to 12, it makes sense there are not queues.</div></div><hr />

Fair enough, but for the record retail would be a LOT better condensed down to 12-25 realms.<br />
<br />
they have about 220 dead realms, and a handful that are growing in population because people are migrating from the dying realms in droves.<br />
<br />
An ESO style megaserver is 10 years overdue for retail wow</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the biggest requests FOR modern wow, actually, is a mega server or HUGE server crunch because we have 90% dead realms, and a handful where everyone is transferring to. When everyone starts piling up on a few realms; it's a sign of a games decline.<br />
<br />
<br />
What's the server cap/size like on classic?<br />
<br />
I know retail got a pretty huge bump at start of Legion, which even with a bunch of players returning for the start of expac dropped most realms down by a bracket on low/medium/high/full pop (or however it goes). Which is another reason why queues are less often since then (and they go by much faster, had a queue over 1k go by in a matter of minutes).<br />
<br />
Is there any info that classic is using new realm sizes instead of old?</div></div><hr />

Now i don't disagree at all about that statement. But i was simply pointing out that the queues in classic and the queues in retail is a completely meaningless comparison.</div></div><hr />

They are using the new infrastructure tech and they have layering so the realms can hold a LOT more than back in the day. It's more comparable to live wow server capacity than vanilla</div></div><hr />

I really wish I had stayed on the full realm I once played on for retail, instead of this years long sojourn into low pop. Blizz just needs to handle servers better - it's okay to merge when your game is still notable/popular, it won't bring more game is dying than there already will be.<br />
<br />
Of course if you absolutely don't care about seeing players about you, the queue-less choice could be cool and I still think it's a good idea to try to alert this beforehand.</div></div><hr />

have you logged into to see the Realm List lately? Half are FULL now, with most at HIGH.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, this right here is pretty much spot on. Blizzard has let servers stagnate to death before, if only to push paid transfers. I don't trust that they will do the right thing here and merge servers if the population dies out in a few months, they'll probably introduce paid services to Vanilla at some point just to reap the extra cash.</div></div><hr />

I'll not sure that classic is going to be the resounding success some people are expecting, but I'm trying to imagine being so deluded and negative to assume they'll be &quot;dead&quot;. Hell, private servers alone show there's definitely a large enough community to ensure these all stay alive.<br />
<br />
Do you just like, feed off of negativity?</div></div><hr />

Don't be a naive child. Early high numbers doesn't mean long term numbers.<br />

These ignorant kids. ACTUALLY it means the MMO is dead which it is and everyone plays on the highest populated server so there's ques. Which is exactly what it is on that game. <br />
It would be like if wow died in 10 years, everyone on US would move to Illidan because it'd still be the highest populated server and then stupid posts &quot;Illidan has que times so the game is still popular!!! durrr&quot;<br />
I get que times logging into Blade and soul still and that game is dead as shit<br />
<br />
That stick must be so far up your ass it's poking your brain. Why people wish for a game to do poorly I'll never know. The more successful any game is the more fun can be had by everyone, including you. Once that stick is removed, anyway.</div></div><hr />

Granted, this might just apply beyond release, but how many servers opened later than the others remain healthy in population once the rush dies down?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not necessarily. If they just shift subs from retail to classic, Retail will get even less revenue back. No tokens, character services and ingame store so less revenue. If it get a million NEW players that doesn't play retail, sure, but that is never going to happen.<br />
<br />
Retail becoming less profitable because players shifting is NOT going to be better for retail now, is it</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CrawlFromThePit</div><div class="date">2019-08-16, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder how populated this server will be since so many people have already figured out their realms, it's a nice option though since Faelina is the streamer server, Thalnos is the home to the Brazilian community, and Herod is the largest server.<br />
<br />
A lot of people really don't give a shit about retail or reserving cliché names. That means their account is currently not active, not getting scammed by Blizzard's fuckery. I can easily see them populating the new server, on top of that there will be people who get annoyed at the Herod queue the moment they log in and just make a new toon on that new server instead.</div></div><hr />
