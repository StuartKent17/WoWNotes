There are a lot of exciting changes coming for PvP in Legion, and today, we'd like to take the opportunity to share some more details on some of those changes!<br />
<br />
The Honor System<br />
In Legion, Honor and Conquest will no longer be currencies that you use to buy gear from vendors. Instead, characters who have reached maximum level will earn Honor Points from competing in Battlegrounds or Arenas, similar to how lower-level players earn Experience Points. As you earn Honor Points, you will increase your Honor Level, up to the maximum Honor Level of 50. Along the way, you'll earn a number of rewards, including Gold, Artifact Power, and a brand new set of PvP-only Honor Talents.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/december/thumb/pvpblog01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/december/pvpblog01.jpg) <br />
<br />
Honor Talents are a special set of Talents that are only active when a player is in a PvP instance (such as a Battleground or Arena) or otherwise engaged in PvP combat, and work in addition to your normal Talents. They are unlocked, one at a time, as your Honor Level increases. So, by Honor Level 10, you'll have one option available in each row, but as you continue to increase your Honor Level, more and more options will become available for you to change up how you approach PvP gameplay.<br />
<br />
For example, a Windwalker Monk who has reached Honor Level 10 can choose Rushing Tiger Palm, which lets them use Tiger Palm at range to dash toward and slow their target. Or, a Restoration Druid who has reached Honor Level 46 can take Deep Roots, which makes their Entangling Roots spell no longer break when the target is damaged.<br />
<br />
Which Honor Talents you choose can have significant impact on how you play your character, and allow you to tailor your abilities to fit with the type of PvP content you're participating in, or even who you're playing with!<br />
<br />
<br />
Kicking It Into Gear<br />
So, if you're not earning Honor or Conquest to purchase gear any more, how will your equipment contribute to your character's strength in PvP? The answer is... it won't (much).<br />
<br />
In Legion, as soon as you zone into a PvP instance, the stats on your gear will be nullified, and you'll be given a pre-determined set of stats that's uniquely configured for your specialization. Furthermore, any set bonuses, enchants, Legendary bonuses, or trinket effects will be deactivated (although your Artifact and its related Artifact Powers will remain active).<br />
<br />
The only contribution your gear will make to your overall power is through a small modifier based on your average item level. For every point that your average item level increases, your pre-determined PvP stats will increase by 0.1%. That means a 25 item level difference between two players only results in a 2.5% difference in stats, compared to the 25% difference it makes today. There’s still a little incentive to improve your gear – a concept we think is important for World of Warcraft – but the benefits are much less pronounced.<br />
<br />
These changes bring a couple of major advantages. First of all, it puts everyone participating in organized PvP on a much more even playing field. Obviously, you'll still want to unlock your Honor Talents to reach your full potential, but you'll be able to hold your own in battle in the meantime.<br />
Second, it allows us infinitely more control to make PvP-specific balance tweaks. If one spec's Mastery is too strong in PvP, that's fine – we can just reduce the amount of Mastery they have. If a spec is too easy to kill, we can increase their Stamina. If a healer is having too much trouble keeping teammates alive, we can increase their Spellpower. In short, we can tune classes for PvP in a way that’s exclusively focused on PvP.<br />
<br />
Equipping For Battle<br />
Even though your gear has very little impact on the strength of your character in instanced PvP, and you won't be spending Honor or Conquest to buy gear from vendors, we still want you to be able to earn gear through PvP. We really like how the Strongbox system has worked out so far in Random Battlegrounds and Skirmishes, and so we're working on a similar system for Legion, with some major improvements.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/december/thumb/pvpblog02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/december/pvpblog02.jpg) <br />
<br />
In Legion, you’ll earn gear simply by completing Battlegrounds or Arenas. In rated matches, the quality of the gear will be increased based on your rating. Of course, that's in addition to the Honor you'll earn towards unlocking your Honor Talents.<br />
<br />
We're also doing away with the idea of PvP-specific gear. Since your stats are pre-determined, trinkets and set bonuses are disabled, and your item level gives only a small increase, we don't need to worry about making you wear a separate set of gear in PvP. So, in Legion, gear is gear, regardless of where you earned it, with no PvP-specific stats or fluctuating item levels, and the best players in both PvP and PvE content will be able to earn the best gear.<br />
<br />
'Tis The Season<br />
Legion is also bringing several changes to how PvP seasons, as well as their rewards, will work. Over the years, we've seen the high-end PvP community tend to flock to one faction over the other, even if it's not the faction they'd prefer. Racial balance is an important part of that, but we also think many players tend to simply choose the faction where they feel the best players are.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/december/thumb/pvpblog03.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/december/pvpblog03.jpg) <br />
<br />
So, in Legion, we'll be handing out end-of-season PvP awards separately to the top percentages of players in each faction, instead of in relation to the overall player base. That means that, even if you believe one faction to have an advantage over the other, you can still play the one you want to, without having to worry about losing your shot at Gladiator.<br />
<br />
On top of that, we're planning to have more frequent, shorter PvP seasons. Since your Honor Level doesn't reset between seasons, and the effectiveness of gear has been greatly diminished, you'll be able to start competing at near-maximum potential immediately, instead of having to wait several weeks while you collect a new set of gear. That means we can have more PvP seasons, which means rewards can be handed out more regularly.<br />
<br />
All For The Prestige<br />
However, once you've reached Honor Level 50, you'll have a tough choice to make. You'll be given the option to Prestige, which will reset your Honor Level back to 1, and once again restricting access to higher-level Honor Talents. However, in return, you'll increase your Prestige Level, which grants access to a number of other rewards, including:<br />
<br />
<br />
A badge, based on your Prestige Level, which appears on the scoreboard in Battlegrounds and Arenas, as well as on your nameplate and unit frame.<br />
A title, also based on your Prestige Level.<br />
A wearable faction pennant<br />
A new appearance for your Artifact<br />
A unique mount and pet<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/december/thumb/pvpblog04.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/december/pvpblog04.jpg) <br />
<br />
The higher your Prestige Level, the better rewards you'll have access to. We see the Prestige system as a great way for players who aren't interested in pursuing higher rating, but still enjoy PvP, to have their own unique rewards to chase after.<br />
<br />
A Change of Scenery<br />
There's one more exciting addition we’d like to share today: Legion is bringing two brand-new maps to the Arena.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/december/thumb/pvpblog05.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/december/pvpblog05.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/december/thumb/pvpblog06.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/december/pvpblog06.jpg) <br />
<br />
Located in the fortress of Black Rook Hold, this arena features a large statue in the center, as well as three alcoves to the sides. Access to those alcoves is restricted by a series of gates, which will open and close randomly as the match continues. When the gates are closed, you can use them to hide out of line of sight of your opponents… just be prepared for them to open again moments later!<br />
<br />
Also in development is another arena located in the forests of Val’sharah. When you first enter this arena, you’ll be encased in a dome of vines. When the match starts, those vines will retreat, leaving the starting area exposed to the rest of the arena. In the center, you’ll find three statues, which can be used to break line of sight. However, those statues are located very close to each other, so you’ll need to keep moving if you want to play defensively.<br />
<br />
We're very excited about all of the improvements coming to PvP in World of Warcraft: Legion, and we hope you are too! We look forward to seeing you on the fields of battle.</div></div><hr />

No complaints here, it's most likely going to become infinitely superior to how it's functioned for the last 10 years, but it'll be a completely different game.<br />

This is what so many people wanted to balance pve/pvp seperately, including me.<br />
<br />
This should solve tons and tons of problems imo, now obviously see where this takes us.<br />
<br />
And no we should not have 2 types of brackets, because of gear. Like they stated 25% difference for a newcomer in damage does sound completely rediculous.</div></div><hr />

RIP WoW PvP.<br />

<br />
Welcome, WoW PvP 2.0<br />
<br />
My thoughts exactly, this looks like a massive fix.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OneTripleZero</div><div class="date">2015-12-16, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...now we get gear removed and every one ruining with the same stats that with no effort, shall the player investing his time and the casual should be equal.<br />
<br />

<br />
PvP has literally always been about your skill as a player. Gear did nothing but handicap that. Balancing everyone to even the playing field and letting them duke it out to find who's best skill-wise rather than number-wise is the best thing they could have done.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snackpack</div><div class="date">2015-12-16, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's about time</div></div><hr />

<br />
So your saying that you don't want to play unless you can have a gear advantage over someone. You should welcome these changes as a chance to truly show how badass you are, that your gear difference isn't carrying you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It shouldn't be about overcoming the odds for victory, there should be balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
i'm so sad to see that feeling wither away with the introduction of arena. <br />
<br />
Why are you sad that Arenas was implemented in BC, how has that withered away now?<br />
<br />
<br />
nonetheless, now we get gear removed and every one ruining with the same stats that with no effort, shall the player investing his time and the casual should be equal. <br />
<br />
There is a reward based on your rating, how is that an issue for those that only pursue PVP? This is shared by both side of the community. Nothing's worse than being benched for PVP gear and underperforming in BG's just because you're behind a few months on your PVP gear.</div></div><hr />

We already had that with twinks and the &quot;no-xp&quot; brackets, and we saw how their claims about wanting fair fights proved to be rather different to the truth.<br />

<br />
You beat them due to them not having cooldowns, not because you outplayed them.<br />
Player versus player should be about reacting to an opponent, actually being versus them.<br />
You killed them when they had no such options.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, skill should always be the determining factor.<br />
Or we get a repeat where anyone starting late is held down by the gear difference.<br />
Early on everyone is on a similar level and therefore skill wins out.<br />
Later one when gear is substantially skewing it away from skill alone, should someone with inferior gear be at a distinct disadvantage and fighting an unfair uphill battle that someone starting earlier did not.<br />
No, they should not.<br />
<br />
Just worried about the impact of the PvP talents - time will tell how much of a difference those will make.<br />
Due to lack of forced resets.<br />
<br />
<br />
you aren't forced to raid because you still get gear through pvp, but it will be just normal gear not pvp specific gear.<br />

<br />
World pvp is not meant to be &quot;balanced&quot; or controlled, and so there will be no such rules in that.<br />
Anything goes pretty much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Skill in &quot;skirmish&quot; BG's is mostly dueling, and dueling is a sequence of {game}skills that a class use to each opposite class. basically rogue vs rogue who get a better latency will sap, and then you get the combo [cheapshot-backstab- wait for trinket , vanish ,cheapshot, etc] i don't see personal skill there, but a muscle memory for a combo and better connection. if you are playing arena or rated BG, then coordinated and individual skill it is.<br />
<br />
The thing is , they are applying that for all BG's. if you are catching my drift.</div></div><hr />

Some classes don't mind playing without it, especially races like Undead and Human that have racials which share a short 30s DR with it. Mages can aggressively play without the trinket, and DKs often take Desecrated Ground which makes Relentless seem much more appealing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itisamuh</div><div class="date">2015-12-16, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of it is looking good, but a couple things are worth criticizing:<br />
<br />
1. Little difference in gear is still not the same as no difference. There is no reason a mythic raider should do better in PvP than someone who PvPs all the time. Why they continue to avoid just making it where there are no differences in stats at all is just a mystery to me. The percentages they used were also bogus, pretty sure 25 item levels is nowhere near a 25% difference right now. Stop beating around the bush and just take gear out of the equation.<br />
<br />
2. This is more of a concern than a criticism, but I worry that unrated PvP will award no gear at all, based on them saying it depends what your rating is. I have no interest in rated PvP, and I should not have to do that or raid to do well in unrated PvP.<br />
<br />
3. The whole idea of giving rewards based on which faction you are in seems horribly prone to abuse. What would be to stop Alliance players from faction changing to Horde right before the season ends, to go from Rival to Gladiator? They will definitely need to wipe ratings and MMR when people do any form of faction or server transfer.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dinth</div><div class="date">2015-12-16, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So with ilvl driving up the stat template, does this mean that high end mythic raiders will have the highest advantage in PvP? Or will the strong boxes drop gear that will be on par?<br />
<br />
Mythic raiders now are at 735+ while pvp are at 710+. Therefore, mythic raiders have 2.5%+ higher stats than someone who ONLY PvPs.<br />
<br />
I feel like the strongboxes HAVE to drop gear similar to WoD where it scales up in pvp situations.<br />
<br />
As it currently stands, pvp gear scales up to 730/740 for honor/conquest gear. So there's not really a gap. It's obvious they're trying to make things more skill based, so I really doubt they will make it where mythic raiders have an advantage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No complaints here, it's most likely going to become infinitely superior to how it's functioned for the last 10 years, but it'll be a completely different game.<br />
<br />
Welcome, WoW PvP 2.0<br />
<br />
Yup, a much needed change, it does indeed kills the whole Meta, but I think it's for the better. IMO, they should have gone even further and remove ilvl from the equations. Or else some people will complain PVE will be the new way to do PVP.<br />
<br />
All pvp multiplayer games that attract both players and viewers right now has no out-of-the-game progression. By that I mean, if you play StarCraft 2, Counter-Strike, Dota, HotS, only skills matter, has you are all at the same level no matter how many hours you've put into the game. And ultimately, I think this is the best way to get people interested in PVP. You can't expect to have some people try PVP if, once they get into a arena or battleground, realize they will need a couple of weeks to feel competitive. You need to hook them right away, give them all they need from the get go, and if they like it, they will stay.</div></div><hr />

The only contribution your gear will make to your overall power is through a small modifier based on your average item level. For every point that your average item level increases, your pre-determined PvP stats will increase by 0.1%. That means a 25 item level difference between two players only results in a 2.5% difference in stats, compared to the 25% difference it makes today. There’s still a little incentive to improve your gear – a concept we think is important for World of Warcraft – but the benefits are much less pronounced.<br />

I might've missed it, but I didn't see that stated anywhere. We currently have no idea what the item levels are going to end up being for Legion. Besides, using their extreme example of 25 item levels (which is HUGE and not all that common currently, because of how easy it is to get geared with honor), the 2.5% increase is incredibly small.</div></div><hr />

Again, you have no idea how the item levels are going to play out. 2.5% is minuscule in the grand scheme of things, and that's only going to be in the most extreme of situations. I feel you're just nitpicking to have something to complain about without having the entire picture.</div></div><hr />

Oh I don't know, because they expect the average player to actually be able to read three lines of text?<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though your gear has very little impact on the strength of your character in instanced PvP, and you won't be spending Honor or Conquest to buy gear from vendors, we still want you to be able to earn gear through PvP. We really like how the Strongbox system has worked out so far in Random Battlegrounds and Skirmishes, and so we're working on a similar system for Legion, with some major improvements.&quot;<br />

<br />
WoD pvp is in a weird place, where you need to grind gear, but it doesn't actually make you stronger relative to other players, because everyone else has the same gear too. Grinding gear for no actual reward is a middleground that just doesn't make sense - either make gear exclusive and give an advantage, or remove the grind and make everyone on equal ground. So I like this change.</div></div><hr />

We had around 700 people walking out with Gladiator last patch on the US servers due to the sheer lack of people on the ladder and it's only going to be worse this patch.<br />
<br />
Do they honestly expect people to just flock to the ladder after 2 expansions of extreme cheating?<br />
The system they use for rewards distribution worked in BC/WoTLK when everybody and their dog was PvP'ing but the ladder started to tip off in Cata/MoP and now it's absolute hell to climb.<br />
<br />
They need to adjust the % based rewards to be something that's more akin to prize distribution in the past to actually motivate players to play again.<br />
R1 level players screeched about exclusivity but there comes a point where it's just not motivating and when I'm seeing more BC/WOTLK PVP rewards than Cata/MoP/WoD combined there's a discrepancy problem.</div></div><hr />

The point is that they are moving away from pve-specific gear and pvp-specific gear, it's just gear and the only differentiation in pvp is item level. Which you can obtain through more than one avenue, including via pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Gear will be given out in strongbox's at the end of matches so you don't have to earn currency to buy gear.<br />
- You will be able to gain the same ilvl of gear as PvE players, its not PvP gear because it doesn't have any special for PvP its just gear.<br />
- Yes higher rating will mean higher ilvl gear, this is like raiding where only the top percent get mythic gear so like wise only the top percent will get the top gear from PvP.<br />
- Also there will always be greater rewards for higher rating or difficulty.<br />
<br />
Basically this means you can PvP or PvE and much more easily go between the two.</div></div><hr />

Let me put it this way - there's absolutely no chance they're going to allow casual PvP battlegrounds and arenas to reward heroic raid level gear, let alone Mythic. So the problem is relatively simple - heroic raiders and above, as things currently read, will be better geared in PvP than those who actually invest time in it.

<br />
&quot;Raiders can just jump right into PvP if they want, with no drawbacks. PvP players? Sorry, but you need to grind raid gear first&quot;.<br />

The system should work both ways, and it's currently looking like it's not going to. Frankly, I'm getting a little bored of them devaluing every activity that isn't raiding. Not only is it a niche activity, and casual PvP is substantially more popular, it's actually causing non-organised raiders to resent raids entirely. That can't be healthy.<br />

Seems wonky to me if that's the case. Hopefully the strong boxes will provide equal gear, sure 25 item levels is only 2.5% increase,<br />

Why not, I'm only a few percentages worse off than you. A lucky crit will have more of an impact. Not to mention the homogenization once Blizzard can fine tune everything on a whim without caring about PvE consequences. There will be no class flavor what so ever left, and without powerful weapons or trinkets and whatnot, you'll feel like your character is stagnant.<br />
<br />
As always Blizzard goes all-out-10000%-or-nothing when it's not needed. Trust me, gearing having near-zero impact in PvP will be one of the main whining bandwagons of Legion.<br />
This is a great change for high-level arena players but the rest? Oh boy.<br />

Sure I can understand they want players to be more on an even playingfield but good lord. A massive part of the enjoyment of MMOs comes from power growth in a personal character, so how fun is it to be locked to a &quot;stat template&quot;?

<br />
And since there's no PVP gear anymore in Legion, people who want to focus on PVP and have the best advantage will have to raid? <br />
<br />
Seems wonky to me if that's the case. Hopefully the strong boxes will provide equal gear, sure 25 item levels is only 2.5% increase,<br />
<br />
but having to resort to pve to boost your pvp is very strange.<br />
<br />
Meh lets say 50 item level different is still only 5% increase yea its a little better but not like it is now days so I don't think you HAVE to resort to pve to boost your item level.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly what I've been wanting from a PvP system since Burning Crusade. The split between PvP gear and PvE gear making you farm two separate sets turned me off as soon as I burnt out on farming gear during Season 1 and 2 at the same time as progressing raids (back in 2007). I have barely pvped since that time because of the game being completely separated in such an annoying way. This change is reminding me a little bit of how vanilla WoW was where you could take PvP gear into raids or take raid gear into PvP and remain competitive either way.</div></div><hr />

Or will the strong boxes drop gear that will be on par?<br />
<br />
Mythic raiders now are at 735+ while pvp are at 710+. Therefore, mythic raiders have 2.5%+ higher stats than someone who ONLY PvPs.<br />
<br />
I feel like the strongboxes HAVE to drop gear similar to WoD where it scales up in pvp situations.<br />
<br />
They dont if they drop the same gear obtained in pve with rating determining if its normal, heroic, or mythic quality. Doesnt sound like it will have nearly as much impact in pvp as the ilvl spreads do now. Try to remember that the current state is designed very differently. Mythic might be at 735+, but so is everyone finishing up their conq gear. Hell, you can be at 732 with mostly honor gear and 3-4 conq items and never step foot in even a normal dungeon</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm of the opinion that if all you do is unrated PvP you don't need/deserve the gear. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh but why should you get the best gear for content that isn't challenging? The top players get the top gear, I see nothing wrong with this. <br />
<br />
You will be able to get gear through rated PvP, this new system has been a long time coming.<br />

<br />
Yes they should, you seem very entitled to think that just because you can spam random BGs you somehow deserve the same gear as mythic raiders.<br />
<br />
If you want the best gear through PvP, get in rated BGs or play arena. That 2.5% will not matter in a random BG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get good at pvp and earn the same gear that way. It will mean the same as it does when you earn it in PvE. Either way, the ilvl effects get muted in pvp and emphasized in pve. If you cant have fun in pvp based on skill rather than imba gear, its probably not the best fit for you.</div></div><hr />

Because its true? You could be legitimately concerned if that was all they said, but it wasn't. Strongbox drops vary in quality based on your pvp rating. Get a good rating and your gear (for both pve and pvp) improves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where did you get that impression? I'm saying the best player should win a PvP engagement regardless of how long he has been level capped or how much gear he has. It should be about skill.<br />
<br />
The 2.5% difference between a fresh player and a veteran mythic raider is much more manageable than what we have currently. They have said rated PvP will still give gear so the players that really care and are skilled won't be at any disadvantage compared to a mythic raider.<br />
<br />
And to be honest, most raiders I know are pretty terrible at PvP. It's been said many times on these boards but a good PvPer will transition smoothly into PvE, but no so much the other way around.</div></div><hr />

No, he is saying that for unrated PvP people shouldn't be capable of curb stomping someone trying to gear up either for the first time or on a new toon. That grind can be ridiculously painful and it's unnecessary. Players of a higher caliber should still be more than capable of destroying a newbie despite being on near equal power curve stats wise. This outcry if purely coming from people who feel like they are entitled to unnecessarily perpetuate a cycle of newer players/characters getting rolled for &quot; teh luls &quot;. The balance, if done right, will make the game much more enjoyable for everyone and encourage more people to step into it from the get go unlike how it's been since the game's inception. <br />
<br />
The only issue I have is with the idea that someone who afk grinds unrated battlegrounds for long enough, will end up with gear comparable to people doing heroic/Mythic content on the PvE side of things. To be fair though they haven't dropped any numbers for item level comparisons yet but unless unrated BG gear is near the &quot; normal/Flex &quot; item level then to me that's the only problem as the same means of afk'ing through battlegrounds can't be attained in a similar fashion in PvE. Someone can't just spam run heroic pugs, not participating and end up with full compliment of gear. Well, not unless they buy several heroic raid carries, which less be honest doesn't fucking happen but by a small number of people. <br />
<br />
TL:DR - As long as the item level comparisons for gear adequately represents the same level of effort required to attain it, across both aspects of the game &quot; PvP and PvE/unrated and rated &quot; then people shouldn't have an issue with the removal of gear as a major form of power and be glad they are finally taking massive steps to overhaul the balancing issues.</div></div><hr />

They mentioned that gear would come from rated PvP so I don't think this will be an issue :)<br />

<br />
The irony here is that you essentially made his point for him. Adjusting the mastery level and spell power ratios on a per spec basis is precisely why they created a base template for everyone to go into PvP with. Blizzard is saying that while in PvP instances, BGs/arena, your scaling factors for everything regarding your character will be X and while doing everything else it'll be Y. As opposed to your idea of them taking development time in coding every single spell and passive, per class, per spec to change how it in itself behaves and interacts with everything else while in PvP combat. The template solution kills two birds with one stone and saves on a tremendous of development time for something that's completely unnecessary other than the fact it would allow for people to keep their precious gear system the same. Changing how PvP is designed as a whole fixes the issue of new players feeling overwhelmed when rerolling or starting months into an expansion unnecessarily and addresses their ability to fine tune every spec to a respectable level and in a timely manner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Just separating every PvE from PvP spell&quot; in practice it's counter-intuitive to separate every PvE from PvP spell because players will have to use different skills in two different environments and if skills are separated then there needs to be separate PvP and PvE talents whereas in Legion the PvP talents are an addition to and not instead of class talents.<br />
<br />
Separating PvE and PvP spells won't change anything in terms of balance but will make it worst because they will still need to change these new &quot;PvP spells&quot; and tweak them relatively to gear! and that is the actual problem and so this person is asking to introduce a new problem rather than solving an old one.<br />
<br />
Hahaha you miss the entire point.<br />
Im talking about the same spells having different values for one or the other. I was an active pvp player during early Cata, warriors were out of control with colossus smash bypassing 100% of player's armor. Blizzard decided to fix the problem by allowing colossus smash to bypass 100% armor just in pve, while doing only 25% or something against players. It worked wonders, solving the problem without affecting the pve players. <br />
But hey im waiting for your bright ideas in order to fix this problem. Hope they don't involve stripping the game of it's actual fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd argue it's you that's missing the entire point here in this whole argument. Yes, they were physically capable of changing a few spells here and there, colossus smash being one of them, to work differently in PvP than in PvE but any serious Warrior wouldn't say it &quot; worked wonders &quot; in fixing the issue. Those of us that were getting rolled by Warriors for that time would say the nerf worked wonders, but it caused such a tremendous headache for not only developers to try and tweak and re-tweak and re-tweak numbers and talents to make up for the fact that Warriors output was designed around Colossus smash bypassing 100% armor, but for players as well in trying to find ways to stay relevant in higher rated scenes. <br />
<br />
Bottom line with the notion of them making every spell and talent interact and scale differently while in a PvP situation as opposed to in a PvE situation is broken down like this. <br />
<br />
1. It's a massive undertaking coding wise because they not only have to adjust the numbers, which fucks with every other number with not just that spec's kit but with the class in itself and how other characters receive it. They also have to adjust tool tips for all these spells so that they can adequately explain the distinction between the two scenarios for players without them being paragraphs long. <br />
<br />
2. The creation of a template for every class/spec specifically for PvP scenarios allows them to freely tweak and adjust things without it having 0 affect on PvE balancing, which in of itself was a huge reason for adjustment inadequacies and for their implementation taking so long in the first place.<br />
<br />
3. It also fixes the issue that many players have with transition into PvP either for the first time on a new toon or returning from an extended absence. It's bad game design to allow the majority of the players involved in an aspect of your game to largely feel disinclined to even step foot into battlegrounds due to how they can be rolf-stomped by someone who has 80%+ power increase due to gear alone. It's one thing to get destroyed and out played by someone who is just better than you. It's another to get killed in 4 seconds by someone who Netflix'ed and chilled his way over the last 3 months to the best quality gear. stat wise, in the game. <br />
<br />
4. There is literally 0 downside to this change except for those players who desire nothing more than to curb stomp under geared players for teh luls because they feel entitled to do so simply because they grinded out BGs/bought 2's carries for months.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Yeah, I share you sentiment about the &quot; unique &quot; rewards. If they're going to make the primary distinctions between characters in PvP be all about the aesthetics and not power creep, they better make sure there is a ton of variety and/or customization available.</div></div><hr />

Will we equip highest ilvl gear in pvp even if its garbage for us?<br />
<br />
Also worried about the new arenas random things in arena do not work out well those doors opening and closing might cause problems. For example nagrand arena back in the day when the pillars would go up and the cyclone Blizz removed both later and also added the stairs in the middle of blade's edge arena and removed the columns. <br />
<br />
I am very happy with the changes but these are very drastic and pvp doesn't see much action in beta so things will probably be broken for the first season of legion.<br />
<br />
Also its very hard to trust blizz about &quot;unique&quot; rewards. Only the first season of WoD provided unique 2k+ elite gear. In season 2 it was recolor of conquest gear with minor change to helm or shoulder. In season 3 its the exact same elite gear as season 2 not even recolor. On top of that all these gears are just recolor of raid gear.</div></div><hr />

That is not how I understood it from the front page (From that quote: In Legion, as soon as you zone into a PvP instance, the stats on your gear will be nullified, and you'll be given a pre-determined set of stats that's uniquely configured for your specialization.) which is why I wanted to post my opinion on the matter.

Gear sucks if you want to be able to pvp occasionally, but not all the time. You start okay at the beginning of an expansion, but then as other people get more gear, you get your face smashed in, regardless of your actual skill.<br />
<br />
I like to think that this is actually a step back towards how vanilla pvp was played. Pvp gear back then wasn't too common, was roughly equivalent to raid gear, and didn't have special bonuses in pvp combat. That meant that if you were just starting in pvp, you didn't get absolutely crushed by people, and if you had other schedule issues, but liked to pvp occasionally, you could. I honestly think this is a really good change. The people who like to pvp can now do it for the same prestige they did it for previously, and now it will be based more around skill, and less about how much gear you ground out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has become too balanced in PvE, and not balanced enough in PvP. <br />
<br />
They seem to be attempting to address that.<br />
<br />
PvE benefits greatly from uniqueness and special abilities ... that was forced out to address PvP.<br />
PvP needs almost 100% balance ... but it couldn't be achieved without destroying any PvE enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Separating the two has been a holy grail, and it is good they are having their first bite at the cherry. There will be some teething problems, but at least it is a step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

No, if you're an &quot;old&quot; player and a good one, a new player should be meeting a tough challenge, but not fucking way should you be ENTITLED to win just because you've been playing for longer. <br />
<br />
How awesome is this change going to be for alts when reaching top level? No more painfully grinding BGs / Ashran as a completely useless undergeared scrub.<br />
No more joining BGs and hoping to God you avoid the low-geared alts.<br />

<br />
So is gearing going to still matter for World PvP or are we going to be scaled down? <br />
<br />
I don't think PvPers are going to be happy with the idea that we can be totally owned by raiders in Mythic Gear while out on the field.<br />
<br />
You may not like the answer, but the solution will now be &quot;Get better at your game&quot; rather than, &quot;Better go Ashran to get that end-gear&quot;. I for one think that is a fantastic change, I welcome the challenge and at the same time I'm thrilled that I will no longer have to feel completely useless in BGs when I join on alts.<br />

Wouldn't mind these being unlockable at various pvp levels, TBC gear at level 10, WOTLK 20, Cata 30 etc. Maybe even put some of them in prestige levels if leveling honor levels turns out to be pretty quick. Good point though, guessing these will be handled in a different way now.</div></div><hr />

Why is this though, they have literally said that the best gear will come from both PvE and PvP. The fact that there is no more PvP / PvE gear means the gear will be the same, only that just like in PvE, the best PvP players will have access to the best gear. That's called even, not advantage. I've never bought into the &quot;PvP players should be best at PvP combat&quot; for the sole fact that most of the PvP geared people have just steamrolled their way through Ashran or BGs. Makes no sense why these people should have any advantage over say mythic raiders who work hard as hell to get their gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the gear issue, to me it seems they are going with a direction as: Do high end content rewards in high end gear. And it is kinda up to the player if they want to just focus on one bit and prehaps be a tiny bit slower in aquire the highest possible ilvl. And for those that are doing high end gaming in both pvp, raiding and challenge modes are rewarded with a faster way to get high ilvl but they need to put down more time into the game as well.<br />
Pretty much how it should be in my opinion.<br />
<br />
If there truly is a need for those that focus on pvp to have a little edge in the end from those that do other stuff as well then it could be possible to reward pvp players with cosmetic gear with a high ilvl and no stats. Worthless in pve and good for pvp as it is only ilvl that matters now.</div></div><hr />

No, it will be balanced/even/fair. Best PvE players have access to the best gear. Best PvP players have access to the best gear. People who aren't good enough for either will also have access to gear of the same power, fit for their level of skill. No more scrubs grinding ashran so that they can rape people that are better than them. It's good.</div></div><hr />

That's a pretty ambiguous statement, though. The best players in PvP get the best PvP gear? The best players in PvE get the best PvE gear? How does that figure into the &quot;gear is gear&quot; mantra? Will you use scaling to sort out differences? And, if so, how does that solve the discrepancy between raiders needing only one set of gear and PvP players needing two?<br />
<br />
And it doesn't answer my wider point - what happens to the casual players in PvP who just grind out their gear at the moment via honour and conquest? You don't have to be high rated to get a full set of conquest gear, just play plenty of PvP; how does the lockbox system allow for that?<br />
<br />
What about PvP set bonuses? What about PvP enchants?<br />
<br />
It's not clear at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like these changes but since they are borrowing heavily from GW2 PvP they should go ahead and make it account wide as well. This new honor and prestige system sounds really good but it would limit players to one character.<br />
<br />
It was nice being able to switch to any class in GW2 PvP and your pvp experience and karma be the same across all toons.<br />
<br />
They won't make it account wide, for the same reason gladiator mounts and titles aren't account wide.<br />
<br />
<br />
They better damn well have new Battlegrounds this expansion, WoD no BGs was unacceptable.<br />

Where, just where does it ever say PvE players will get PvE gear and vice verca. &quot;Gear is gear&quot; literally means gear is gear, PvE players and PvP players will be earning the same gear. Why would they need scaling? it's the same gear, item levels are the same.<br />
<br />
To the casual who doesn't do rated PvP, probably won't get the best gear. Nor should they. <br />
<br />
Set bonuses, I don't know. They could activate pve bonuses in instances, and pvp bonuses in instanced pvp. As for world play, maybe it activates according to source, maybe it's always pve? pvp set bonuses might not even exist any more (actually, vaguely recall hearing this during blizzcon..?). <br />
Not sure what you mean with PvP enchants, the fact that you might use different enchants for different types of content? No clue how that will be handled.</div></div><hr />

They do at the moment, and via grinding their conquest set. Are we saying that the overwhelming majority of the PvP playerbase, namely the casual battle-grounder and arena toe-dipper are now going to be outgeared by the average normal or heroic raider?<br />
<br />
Because if so, that's a fucking terrible idea.<br />
<br />
They're doing so many good things with PvP in Legion, and I really want to play it. But if they devalue the reward structure for PvP and allow raiders to simply jump in, wreck people, and jump out...

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We're also doing away with the idea of PvP-specific gear. Since your stats are pre-determined, trinkets and set bonuses are disabled, and your item level gives only a small increase, we don't need to worry about making you wear a separate set of gear in PvP. So, in Legion, gear is gear, regardless of where you earned it, with no PvP-specific stats or fluctuating item levels, and the best players in both PvP and PvE content will be able to earn the best gear.<br />
<br />
Sounds clear to me; there's no more PvP gear. You can do PvP to get gear with the same kind of stats as in PvE. No more people raiding in PvP gear or Battlegrounding in Raid gear; gear is gear, regardless of where you get it. No more Resilience or PvP Power or whatever the PvP stats are, and there are no set bonuses while in PvP content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, any set bonuses, enchants, Legendary bonuses, or trinket effects will be deactivated (although your Artifact and its related Artifact Powers will remain active).<br />
<br />
Basically, whether you PvP or your Raid, when you enter a Battleground or Arena, the only item that will give you any bonus effects is your Artifact, and your ilevel will determine your stat increase compared to your opponents and compatriots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would hold the jury on that one. Even casual players have no excuse to not do some casual rated arena games every now and then, and I doubt over-normal / heroic level gear will require a sky-high rating to obtain. Thing is, gear should reflect what you did in order to earn it, and unrated BGs/Ashran have no way at all to reflect upon that other than time spent. I know a lot of people who literally just sit back behind the group and reap the rewards, if these changes means these people get cut off, that's just dandy. <br />
<br />
Oh and yeah: <br />

It means you can play how you want and be competitive in all kinds of play if you feel like trying something else. No need to re-grind pvp / pve gear if you want to switch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pua</div><div class="date">2015-12-17, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds clear to me; there's no more PvP gear. You can do PvP to get gear with the same kind of stats as in PvE. No more people raiding in PvP gear or Battlegrounding in Raid gear; gear is gear, regardless of where you get it. No more Resilience or PvP Power or whatever the PvP stats are, and there are no set bonuses while in PvP content.<br />
<br />
Basically, whether you PvP or your Raid, when you enter a Battleground or Arena, the only item that will give you any bonus effects is your Artifact, and your ilevel will determine your stat increase compared to your opponents and compatriots.<br />
<br />
You're responding to a conversation between thilicen and I, one that started with a response from many, many pages ago. I'd recommend reading my original post on the topic to grab the context, as I've already answered these questions.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would hold the jury on that one. Even casual players have no excuse to not do some casual rated arena games every now and then, and I doubt over-normal / heroic level gear will require a sky-high rating to obtain. Thing is, gear should reflect what you did in order to earn it, and unrated BGs/Ashran have no way at all to reflect upon that other than time spent. I know a lot of people who literally just sit back behind the group and reap the rewards, if these changes means these people get cut off, that's just dandy.<br />
<br />
A couple of things:<br />
<br />
1) It's not about &quot;having an excuse&quot; to do some rated PvP, some folks just aren't especially interested in it. They essentially enjoy being able to log in whenever they like, play some BGs, and earn themselves some gear. Dipping your toe into the occasional arena or RBG is, I wouldn't think, going to be miles behind the same approach from a raider who occasionally queues up and kills some normal and/or heroic bosses.<br />
<br />
2) Cutting people off isn't &quot;just dandy&quot;. It effectively removes people from the pool which means less players in PvP, higher queue times, and more time spent waiting around doing nothing. They need to find a way to realistically gear players up for playing casual PvP, while simultaneously making the &quot;gear is gear&quot; crossover work both ways. If they don't, it's pretty much all raider benefit and nobody else. We're all sick of that.<br />
<br />
When push comes to shove, we already have more than enough evidence to tell us what happens when you try and make everyone &quot;hardcore&quot;. They quit. The game, at this point, simply can't stand to lose any more players that it doesn't have to, and forcing people to either play rated PvP or raid in order to get competitive gear, is a really shitty solution.<br />
<br />
They need to come up with better.<br />
<br />
A relatively simple, and I daresay traditional, solution could well be to increase item levels in lockboxes as you go up in prestige level. It seems so obvious, in fact, that I sincerely hope that's the route they're going to take.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course they should still get gear, and a sense of progression like anyone else. Better lockboxes on prestige may help that, but the top-tier gear (Mythic quality or close) should be reserver for those that fall into the categore of &quot;the best&quot;. And by cutting people off I didn't mean they shouldn't be allowed to participate, simply limit the level of rewards they will be able to achieve without putting in the effort.<br />
With the whole item level stat crunch coming the differences between the gear levels should be minimal in any case, so a good casual player should be able to give an OK hard core player a good run for his money in a one-on-one fight.</div></div><hr />

99% of &quot;World PvP&quot; is max level guys dropping in on other max levels at half health or engaged with mobs to score a cheap kill, or dropping in to lowbies to 1 shot them, why you would need talents when you're already at that kind of advantage is beyond me. World PvP has been ignored since TM vs SS. What can they possibly do to make WPvP something? TMvsSS was a community made thing not a Blizz made thing, but the playerbase has changed so communal events like that are unlikely to happen now.<br />
<br />
The PvP changes are good though im iffy about why higher ilvl gear gives more stats why not just have everyone on a 100% level field in regards to gear and let class/skill be more the factors instead.</div></div><hr />

It's important to keep a sense of progression even if the gap is reduced. This way they can keep that, as well as make the playing field a lot more evened out / fair. Don't think aiming for 100% parity or 100% sense of progression is a good way to do it, so we're finally going to see something different this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I've been saying since 2004, when WoW was released, the goal should be to make PvP skilled-based, rather than gear-based or grind-based, and after 11 years, Blizzard finally seems to want to move in this direction by using a spec template and reducing the effect of gear. However, your power will still be effected by:<br />
1. Grinding more PvP talents.<br />
2. Your artifact weapon.<br />
3. Your gear, still.<br />
<br />
And to top it off, they want you to gimp in PvP yourself by needlessly removing all your PvP talents in order to earn cosmetic rewards.<br />
<br />
Why not just let the prestige system work without requiring a talent reset... no reason, no reason at all.<br />
<br />
This is a contradictory and thoughtless implementation of what is otherwise a great idea.<br />
<br />
Make PvP skill-based only. Make everyone have the same PvP talents from the start. Remove the effect of gear, ENTIRELY, including the artifact weapon. Get it over and done with.</div></div><hr />

There are far more players in full conquest than full mythic, as the former just requires time, whereas the latter requires membership in the top guild on your server.<br />

They seem to be pretty clear that you can get the very best gear from PvP strongboxes, i.e. Mythic gear. This implies a top PvPer will be able to step into Mythic raids and perform pretty well if they can memorize the fight script, which is pretty mind-blowing.<br />

I'm a pretty casual player, so it takes me a while to build up a decent set of gear through questing, crafting, dungeons, LFR, etc. and that has been the major factor in why I don't spend time doing PvP - I simply don't have the time! <br />
<br />
But with this system, at least I can hop in for a match or two and not feel completely useless. If I get my main to Rank 50 Honor just once it'll be a miracle!<br />

But the BEST part - completely separate PvE and PvP tuning! Only took 11+ years, but FINALLY no more PvE getting gimped because sh!t is too OP in PvP! (and vice versa)</div></div><hr />

They said that the higher your rating the higher ilvl the gear will be you get from strongboxes. So the way i'm reading it only the absolute highest rated players will have equal ilvl gear to Mythic raid gear, while still not having any set-bonusses or PvE trinkets. And coincidentally, more often than not will the highest rated PvPers not even do PvE.</div></div><hr />

A good PVPer will have an Advantage over a PVE guy anyways because he is more experienced in PVP...this is already the case today. A good PVEr will have an Advantage over a PVP for the same reason though. Which is why Mythic top guilds recruting PVPers is likely not going to happen.

On top of that, we're planning to have more frequent, shorter PvP seasons. Since your Honor Level doesn't reset between seasons, and the effectiveness of gear has been greatly diminished, you'll be able to start competing at near-maximum potential immediately, instead of having to wait several weeks while you collect a new set of gear. That means we can have more PvP seasons, which means rewards can be handed out more regularly.<br />
<br />
No it will not reset, which will inspire people to participate in full seasons. You can spend part of the season farming gear and then reset your prestige and work on that after you have your ranking.<br />

There will always be some truth in that. The added benefit of the proposed changes is that spec-wide template tuning can be done to refine each spec's survivability, utility, burst, etc. in ways that would have been completely muddled by major differences in gearing before. The power gaps between specs in pvp should get narrower with each iteration in the early weeks of a given season as patching corrects whatever imba combos and exploits gain popularity.</div></div><hr />

The biggest thing to understand and remember: we do not have the correct context to accurately assess the impact these changes will have on gameplay. Many of you are assessing these changes based on the current system in place, which greatly diminishes the reality of our concerns. Take a deep breath and try not to jump the gun. <br />
<br />
Before I begin my short assessment, here is my PvP resume:<br />
<br />
Season 1 - Season 3 Glad: Druid, Warrior, Mage <br />
Season 4: Break<br />
Season 5 Glad: Paladin<br />
Season 6 - 8 Rank One: Paladin<br />
Season 9 Glad: Paladin<br />
Season 10 - Present: Retired from competitive arena, mostly theorycraft and coach. <br />
<br />
<br />
In addition, I was the Co-GM of Treehuggers, the biggest PvP guild in the world from late s6 - s7 and was sponsored by Skill-Capped. Hopefully this provides some context, so let's begin!<br />
<br />
<br />
Honor Talents are a special set of Talents that are only active when a player is in a PvP instance (such as a Battleground or Arena) or otherwise engaged in PvP combat, and work in addition to your normal Talents. <br />
<br />
<br />
Some people in this forum are concerned with the diminished power that the partial removal of gear brings. However, many are forgetting that PvP talents provide an important power curve to your character. While the numbers haven't been crunched yet, after looking through the talents, new players will still be at a disadvantage in comparison to veteran players. However, it hopefully won't be similar to the drastic difference we see today. Alternatively, it could end up being that the previous power curve that existed due to gear has been shifted to talents. We will have to see how the balance pans out, but there will most definitely be a difference between fresh characters and pvp-leveled characters. <br />
Based on the wording, world PvP is also subject to the new PvP system. So mythic raiders will be at a disadvantage if they have not earned their PvP talents. Many mythic raiders, initially, might not have the time nor interest to grind PvP, baring obvious outliers. Assuming that the PvP grind to earn our PvP talents will take some time, there shouldn't be much concern in the short term. I will address the long term concern once there is more info available, as too many factors are missing at the moment. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In Legion, as soon as you zone into a PvP instance, the stats on your gear will be nullified, and you'll be given a pre-determined set of stats that's uniquely configured for your specialization. Furthermore, any set bonuses, enchants, Legendary bonuses, or trinket effects will be deactivated (although your Artifact and its related Artifact Powers will remain active). <br />
<br />
<br />
Based on the wording of this quote, gear does not appear to be nullified in World PvP combat and your PvP stat template does not activate. However, it'll be logical to assume that the PvP stat template will activate during PvP combat, just like our PvP talent system. However, this is just speculation and we still need more information. If our PvP stat template doesn't activate in PvP combat outside of PvP instances, there MIGHT be a reason to be concerned about world PvP. We will have to wait and see, no sense in pouring energy into this just yet. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In Legion, you’ll earn gear simply by completing Battlegrounds or Arenas. In rated matches, the quality of the gear will be increased based on your rating. Of course, that's in addition to the Honor you'll earn towards unlocking your Honor Talents.<br />
<br />
We're also doing away with the idea of PvP-specific gear. Since your stats are pre-determined, trinkets and set bonuses are disabled, and your item level gives only a small increase, we don't need to worry about making you wear a separate set of gear in PvP. So, in Legion, gear is gear, regardless of where you earned it, with no PvP-specific stats or fluctuating item levels, and the best players in both PvP and PvE content will be able to earn the best gear. <br />
<br />
<br />
Based on the wording, unranked Battlegrounds or Arenas will provide a base type of gear that does not scale in quality. Speculation: Meaning, you probably won't be able to earn heroic(normal raid) or higher level gear. Probably will earn LFR level gear. <br />
Ranked Battlegrounds or Arenas will provide gear rewards that are consistent/comparable with your rating earned. Meaning, the higher rated you are, the greater in quality of gear you will receive. How they decide what rating threshold earns what gear quality (LFR/Normal/Heroic/Mythic) is unknown at the moment. <br />
Since they stated that the best players in both PvP and PvE content will be able to earn the best gear, PvP players will not have to become raiders to compete in PvP. Many people on this forum are devaluing the challenges of mythic raiding. The majority of the WoW community will not have access to mythic gear. Concurrently, becoming a top tier PvP player has its own difficulties and is similarly out of reach. In my experience, for the majority of the PvP community, the slight difference in item level that they are providing is not enough to tip the scale for most people. Many of the passive or on-proc advantages of gear, in the past, provided the edge in combat for people. However, with the removal of flagrant power differences, combat should become more &quot;fair.&quot; Many people are not good enough to exploit the minimal numeric advantage that blizzard looks to provide with this change. Most of the time, it's clear mechanical or macro level errors that cause defeat. I would suggest you do not place your energy on min/maxing and look to improve your execution during combat. <br />
<br />
<br />
We simply need to remember that everything is still early in development and not much info is available. As many have stated, this is an RPG, so some level of gear acquisition is warranted. However, this system provides an environment that allows for most people to enjoy the game and compete while striving to earn BiS gear.</div></div><hr />

You get your % power increases (aka higher stats) and you get your special abilities/modification of existing abilities (aka tier set bonuses). How much of a grind it will be and how much of a difference it will be between someone completely new and someone with the pvp tree fully unlocked, it remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />

This is BADDDDDD, sure it's a small diffference but it will mean that the best gear will almost certainly be obtained via raiding. RIP wow pvp if that's the case...ah who am I kidding RIP wow pvp to start with.

<br />
You can get mythic level gear from pvping if you have a high rating with the new system. I would guess the equivalent of 2200+ arena rating needed for mythic ilvl to drop from instanced pvp.<br />

<br />
The transformation of WoW PVP into a completely segregated minigame is now complete. Completely separate mechanics, talents, stat templates. PVP is no longer part of WoW, it is now something completely different existing under the same name. And for what? Idiots complaining on the forums who didn't want to obtain gear? People who think this will be some kind of &quot;high skill esports&quot; game? I pity anyone who is clueless enough to support these garbage changes.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, I cant wait to see the initial stream of terribles trying to PVP again because they genuinely convinced themselves that it was gear holding them back and not their lack of ability.<br />
<br />
I see all of this as a good thing, now all the ones crying will get met with &quot;git gud&quot; and rightfully so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you guys need to note that this gear boosting/scaling will only work insides wfs in open world raid gear will be king,just like in rift.you will earn gear by winning a bg/wf juts like in rift by that gear will be trash compaired to raid gear.the devs will tell you its only a small difference &quot;but even a small one matters&quot; and thats only in bgs.like i said open world will die off as raiders will have the best gear.<br />
<br />
this whole artifact weapon is nothing more then the devs forcing everyone to use the same weapons.if everyone has the same weapon nothing op'ed,but outside of that raid gear armour will be bis across the board.<br />
<br />
go read rifts forums and you can see the hate the players have for the game now,the devs say there is no pvp or pve gear now just gear and the best gear even in wf bgs is raid gear.<br />

My friends were gearing alts while I was still trying to gear my main lol..... So I am not looking forward to that system, as for the predetermined stats, that is pretty annoying too cause once again you will not be able to play your class the way you want just like in WoD...

All those raiders aren't going to have pvp talents unlocked. that's the whole point of it.<br />
and they clearly say that that the pvp system (the spec template and talents) will also work in open world pvp. So, no, the maximum advantage a raider can have is 2.5% better stats, which by themselves won't 1 shot anyone. On top that, the non raider will have pvp talents to use against the raider.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the only downside to this would be that people who are pvp geared now will no longer curb stomp those new to the pvp scene. Honestly, at that point its not even pvp that they liked, it was just the fact that they liked 3 shotting people.<br />

So you're basically the kind of player that most of us have been pointing out as the only ones who will hate this system. You don't want a competitive environment in your PvP play, you just want to two shot the new players or people trying to gear up an alt for teh luls. Just because you started at the start of the expansion doesn't entitle you to making the experience for someone who is new to the game/coming back from a hiatus/gearing an alt unnecessarily painful. You want to complain about not being capable of going 1v3 because they are some &quot; dipshit who never pvp's &quot; and is in similar gear as you, really?.. Today idiots can afk grind BG's while watching Netflix and end up in the same gear &quot; power wise &quot; as those who worked their way to gladiator status. That system isn't changing, it's just being shifted over to the talent system so it doesn't unnecessarily punish new players from assholes like you who just want to curb stomp them. <br />
<br />
You want to go big dick and two shot bitches that have literally no chance against you to make yourself feel powerful? Just go bank people leveling like the rest of the cancerous plebs and stop trying to justify your actions by saying you earned the right to do so because you started playing from the start of the expansion.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Killawar</div><div class="date">2015-12-19, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never in my life have I made an MMO-champ account. Normally I skim the comments, patch notes, and move on, but seeing this horrible excuse for lazy PvP balance has... &quot;upset&quot; me. Why? Well, let's take a look:<br />
<br />
In PvE, gear is used as an incentive. Why? In WoW big numbers are sought after (or in some cases, small depending on placement IE 1st place, etc). Point is, it's a competition and gear serves as the reward system by giving players more &quot;numbers&quot; to work with. In this example, they're essentially nullifying this kind of reward for PvP or in other words, they're abolishing that same sense of numeric accomplishment (big numbers) a PvE player gets from PvP. Why? From a designer standpoint it allows them to be lazy. Yep, laziness. <br />
<br />
&quot;But that's UNFAIR to lower geared people!&quot;<br />
<br />
First of all, this argument is that of a six year old. Where is fair? It doesn't exist. Ever. Class imbalances will always be an unsolvable problem, as people will always find something to complain about, which is in essence, &quot;fair&quot; (an opinion based on an emotional motive). Period. There is no such thing as fair. What's effectively being done is eliminating the reward for obtaining gear for PvP'ers. It's not about having to have a better piece of gear than someone else to get an advantage - no! It's about that numerical accomplishment (seeing bigger numbers, as silly as it sounds) regardless of how you get it. PvE and PvP has had the same kind of &quot;feel&quot; when achieving gear, the means are simply different. In this expansion they're essentially eliminating that kind of satisfaction from PvP which, as a result, eliminates much of the enjoyment from it period (the reward), not to mention the different gear sets are being completely abolished as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then what about the new players getting stomped in PvP by people with higher gear quality?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Simple. You know how raids have a gear requirement? Apply a similar working to that of PvP: get matched with people around your item level. If you want to challenge yourself, allow people to queue against players with higher item levels for no additional reward. That way there's no incentive for people to AFK in harder BG's and the players that simply want to get better will have that opportunity to play against people who have better gear and may be better players in general.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you shouldn't have to have better gear for beating players if you're already better than them!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then nor should raiders have to have better gear for thwarting heroic/mythic bosses, but they do. Why? Because &quot;winning&quot; is only part of the sensation of overcoming an obstacle as are looks. What people are really after in WoW is practicality of their things. Think about it: if there really was no point in obtaining better gear, why would one party keep this aspect while the other is tossed aside? If there's a minute difference in gear for PvP, why not PvE? I'll tell you why: because PvP is once again, being seated in the second class. Sure, in theory this sounds fine, but that's again, theory. Practically, it's exchanging enjoyment and game depth (&quot;Oh, look at that weapon! It's bad ass! I really want it! Look at all these pieces of gear! So cool!&quot;) for developer laziness.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Not A Cat</div><div class="date">2015-12-19, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally holy shit<br />
<br />
I mean, I'm also of the extreme opinion that gear should have NO effect in PvP. Everyone gets the same amount of cumulative points for their stats and everyone gets the same PVP talent choices. I don't think character progression has a place in PvP. If anything is progressing, it's the player's skill in that class in a PvP environment. You shouldn't be penalized because someone played longer, you should be penalized when someone can play their class better than you can play yours, and there's the incentive to get better. Kind of like arena tournament servers, everything is available to you, but what matters is how well you use it.<br />
<br />
But I doubt they'd make such an extreme change, so I'm happy that they're even making a slight effort in that direction.</div></div><hr />

Then the same can be said for PvE. Why does PvE gear increase in stats? Shouldn't it then be who can abide by raid mechanics the best? No. That's garbage. Why? Because part of the reward for doing things isn't just an achievement. It's gear.<br />
<br />
The same argument can be made for PvE. If PvP doesn't have numeric gear awards, nor should PvE have them. Why? &quot;Because the satisfaction of beating the boss should be enough of an incentive!&quot;<br />
<br />
It's garbage logic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I don't think PvE and PvP are the same, nor should they be the same in my opinion. I see PvP as purely competitive whereas I see PvE as purely co-op (with however many people you raid with). I want gear so I can kill the next boss which is more powerful. PvP kind of has that but to a much lesser extent if you look at rating. Okay you stomp the floor with these low rated players, you move up in rank. You then lose to slightly better players so you can't progress. Right now the current option is to keep at it until you get better gear to beat them and move up in rank. I don't think that should be how it works. I would rather have it be that you lose and don't move up in rank, figure out what you did wrong that could have made you lose, then work on getting better at PvP until you can win and progress that way. <br />
<br />
I don't think it's garbage logic, I think it all depends on how you look at the two forms of gameplay.</div></div><hr />

I would rather have it be that you lose and don't move up in rank, figure out what you did wrong that could have made you lose, then work on getting better at PvP until you can win and progress that way. <br />
<br />
I don't think it's garbage logic, I think it all depends on how you look at the two forms of gameplay.<br />
<br />
<br />
They are the same. They use the same kinds of reward system and progress. That's how this game functions - gear as a reward. That's not an opinion, that's a fact. So PvE isn't you competing against other guilds/NPC bosses? I don't think that's the case.<br />
<br />
You state that you get stuck at a current rating when you don't have the &quot;skill&quot; to progress past a certain group of players, yet the same thing can be stated for your raid encounter. Don't abide by the raid mechanics as well? You wipe and can't progress. So then why should the bosses drop better gear if it's solely your fault? If you're saying that PvP should offer no new gear and better stats, there is no reason PvE should. Why? Because you should be forced to get better (by your logic) and not see a numeric improvement because you don't need it (or so you say).<br />
<br />
<br />
There's your opinion, and then there's fact.<br />
<br />
Fact: gear has been a motive since WoW's conception.<br />
Opinion: &quot;I don't think this is good for PvP!&quot;<br />
<br />
The reason behind this is that you say the game should correlate to skill, yet PvE abides by the same mechanic (raid skill, though different than PvP skill is still skill) so why should PvE then offer better gear? They work in the same respect (besting something), so said victory is what one should be after, not the gear. So why do you need the gear for PvE? Bottom line is, by your logic, you don't. So, lets just simplify everything and eliminate gear! Oh, wait... Then there'd really be a whole lot less of a reason to play.<br />

Because PvP and PvE are NOT the same (that is the entire point of this change).<br />
<br />
I am 100% behind this change. (and looking at the rest of this thread so are a lot of other people)<br />
<br />
They have the same end. If you're saying they don't then you don't know what you're talking about. At every point in this game gear has been the reward. Why do you get higher rating? To get the 2200 stuff and a title. Why do you raid? To get the achievement stuff and better gear. Notice when you take one half of that equation out you have a lot less of a reason to do said thing.<br />
<br />
And once again, PvE and PvP have the same kind of reward system in retrospect, so PvE shouldn't offer better gear by your logic either. Why? &quot;Because your skill as a player should be able to overcome the bosses without having to inflate your stats!&quot;<br />
<br />
Garbage logic. And, by the way, I don't expect anyone to know what they're talking about, so of course the majority are going to agree as the majority are PvE and know fairly little about PvP.</div></div><hr />

Why does it matter so much that you have the ability to unnecessarily, not unfairly, be able to curb stomp someone new or on an alt? That is what is being debated here. Not whether or not its important for people to have gear that gets stronger as you progress further in the expansion. Of course there should be a power increase each time you go up. The question is whether or not it's necessary to be capable of two shotting a new player and I don't believe so. <br />
<br />
Making this change allows people who have taken breaks or are trying out an alt to not feel like it's pointless to even step into a BG because they are useless. This increases the number of people in the ques and opens the door for people who might not have considered PvP'ing an incentive to give it a try. This change literally negatively affects no one other than those who que into BGs simply to stomp someone who has 0 chance against them due to lack of gear. If that's all you que into BGs for then you should just go camp people who are leveling to get your rocks off instead because this debate is just ridiculous. <br />
<br />
For the record, raiding and PvP are not the same kind of gameplay at all. While yes, both types of players incentivize that feeling of getting more powerful with each tier of difficulty, those of us who are at a higher level of raiding understand that while gear helps in some regards it doesn't give you an automatic win. Mastering the mechanics has been and will always continue to be the main way a raid defeats an encounter. As opposed to in PvP where even some of the highest rated PvP'ers would find it nearly impossible to 2v1 some newbies who also had the same gear as they did because gear plays that large of a factor. Same goes for a gladiator level player trying to 1v1 someone who was in the best gear now, it'd be nearly impossible for them to. Where as in raiding, the top guilds on every server prove that if you master the mechanics you can defeat the hardest bosses with shit gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's assuming that you're talking to a person that is supporting having gear as opposed to one that supports a player not having gear and beating a player who does. Some people are very capable of beating another player that has better gear, and the difficulty is what some people actually like. Then, when you get gear on said other character and absolutely curb stomp said geared player, the satisfaction is there wholly. There's a difference between giving a player a chance in a BG and eliminating the need to gear period. 2% is nothing. If people are so concerned about gear disadvantage and people leaving then coming back, why not make the honor gear scale with the current season IE if you get the honor gear, this gear will remain the lowest gear set for PvP throughout the expansion, but scale. Example:<br />
<br />
Starting item level for the expansion (blues) is 100. Conquest gear is 135. Next season the conquest gear is 160, honor scales up to say, 125-130 on the gear one already has. Problem solved. This way, the conquest player has an advantage next season for playing, yet the honor geared player isn't left to rot.<br />
<br />
A PvP gladiator will have even less of a chance this expansion for outplays due to gear &quot;equality&quot; (lol), so I don't get what you're saying. Having a gear advantage in PvP doesn't auto win one games either, so that point is also fodder. And, again if you already say that you don't need gear to win in PvE, then why do you need better gear as an incentive? Because that's how the game works, and you're effectively taking that incentive away from PvP. These points of yours make no sense because you've effectively given the evidence to disprove what you're trying to say in your own response.</div></div><hr />

That is how it functions now, and I'm saying that I don't think they should be treated the same. Also competitive PvE is such a small niche in the community that I wouldn't consider it to have any influence on Blizzard's design choices. The fact is yes they are treated the same, but no I don't think they are the same, in one you're killing a player, and the other you're killing a pre-programmed treasure chest. That's the major difference, when fighting a boss you're basically fighting against numbers, but when fighting a player it's a lot less predictable and therefore relies less on gear. <br />
<br />
Yes there is skill in raiding, but it's a different type of skill. If you're skilled at raiding you aren't going to be skilled at PvP and vice versa. And it's my opinion that the progression system in each should focus on that. PvE has always been about gating content behind big numbers, and so has PvP. But that doesn't make sense in PvP. Someone shouldn't be skillful in PvP because they've played longer, because they aren't fucking a pre-programmed treasure chest, they're fighting another player. The gating should be that player's skill versus their opponent's skill.<br />
<br />
Again, it all depends on how you look at each style of gameplay, your OPINION is that they're the same. And the reasons you give are valid because they are similar. However, my opinion is that they aren't the same because of the clear differences in them. I don't know why you're trying so hard to prove your opinion is fact. You're saying that gear needs to be an incentive to PvP because gear is an incentive to PvE. But I'm saying that the difference comes in what you're fighting. If you don't see the difference between fighting another player and a boss, well then that's your opinion, but don't try and state it as fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raid boss does a threatening move = you react to it. The same goes within the context of PvP except in a much smaller time frame and/or jukes and bluffs.<br />
<br />
I don't know if you realize this, but length of time played = experience. Experience = propagating skill, so when you say that someone shouldn't be rewarded for playing longer, you're effectively countering your own argument. The fact that experience is also rewarded through gear is an incentive to gain more experience. That's a function of leveling up as well, but once you're level capped - guess what - experience serves no purpose, and that's where gear comes in. You're trying to justify removing a PvP reward because you don't want to work for PvP. That's ridiculously ignorant. Players aren't pre-programmed? Actually, they are. You know those nifty little skills and buttons you get? Those are pre-programmed. A human being can only play to the extent that his/her buttons allow, meaning that there is a cap and players are essentially pre programmed when playing the most efficiently. This is why there are counter comps and the like. <br />
<br />
My &quot;opinion&quot;? Uh, no. This game has had gear as a reward from the start. Fact. You're saying that's a bad thing for PvP on the basis that people shouldn't have gear making a difference and it should be all skill. Problem with that is someone dedicated to the craft isn't getting rewarded for it like PvE hero is. You're saying that for the people who don't play's sake you should remove the reward from PvP so it's easier for them? That's garbage. There's a fine line between rewarding people just enough who actually do PvP, and eliminating rewards entirely. There are vastly superior ways of making PvP not a living hell for players who have alts (gear checks for BG's and matching up people who have equivalent gear, scaling honor gear throughout the expansion) rather than being lazy. This is what your argument is: laziness.<br />
<br />
You don't want to have to dedicate time to PvP to PvP. You don't. You have to dedicate time to PvP. You're rewarded for doing this with gear. If you're PvP'ing for the gear, and not to get better, you're PvP'ing for the wrong reason in the first place. Getting rewarded with the gear effectively separates the people who aren't dedicated to it from the people that are. By your logic, people shouldn't need better gear to PvE and the reward of defeating the boss should be enough, but it isn't. Why? Because this game works off of numerical reward (fact). PvP shouldn't work off of numerical reward is what you're saying (opinion), but as shown above, that logic is fodder.<br />
<br />
Either way you're &quot;fighting&quot; pixels, the difference is who/what is controlling said pixels, so yes in retrospect you're fighting the same thing. Trying to tell me I'm not is like saying you're not playing the same game because you're raiding ICC and not SoO, but the truth of the matter is that you are, and gear works as a reward period. Fact. Don't muddle facts with opinions as when you do it makes your point look all the more foolish.</div></div><hr />

I don't think that length of time = propagating skill. You're putting way too much faith in the playerbase if you think that everyone who has played for a long time is skilled at this game because that's simply not true.

<br />
If that person dedicated to the craft isn't as skilled as someone who just started playing then they shouldn't be rewarded in PvP because they are losing. Just like if you don't kill a boss you don't get loot because you lost. If you win, you go up in rank. Although I can agree with you that I think they should have some sort of cosmetic rewards, like challenge mode sets and weapons, as people get higher in rank. But that way the armor/weapons are still a reward but they don't give you an advantage over someone just starting. Also you really need to tone down with the aggressiveness. I just disagree with you yet you're insulting me and it makes you look childish to be honest.<br />

That analogy doesn't make much sense. ICC and SOO are both PvE so I don't understand what comparison you're making.

<br />
<br />
You're trying to make it that way.<br />
<br />
There are some raid bosses who use abilities at random, there's more time to react.<br />
<br />
Everyone who has played a long time is better than they were when they didn't. It's how it works. So yes, time does propagate skill regardless whether you want to admit it or not.<br />
<br />
Players are only capable of playing so well to the degree that their buttons allow. This is why certain classes have counters etc. If they were truly free to play however they wanted there would be no such thing. But because counter comps and counters exist in general, this shows that certain buttons take precedence over others, meaning that the buttons take precedence over the player.<br />
<br />
Stating facts =/= name calling. If you're going to say something ignorant and foolish, be glad that someone is willing to point it out for you so you don't make that mistake again. Secondly, you just said to use gear as an incentive, yet the purpose of gear goes beyond cosmetics. You're saying keep the gear, but make it nonfunctional. Reasoning? Because newer players will be at a disadvantage. So are new players at PvE. Your justification for that is that it's easier and less complicated to kill a PvE boss, so that's why gear should be a reward. that doesn't make much sense, does it? If something is harder than something else, shouldn't one be rewarded with better gear? Makes sense. Players are harder to kill than PvE bosses, so killing the best of players should be rewarded with the best of gear. Newer players? That's what the rating system is for. That's what MMR is for - fighting people of similar gear and skill. Update this and the problem will be solved. Eliminating gear entirely is a horrid idea.<br />
<br />
You're missing the point. Both pixels are only capable of doing so much, so in retrospect a player is like a raid boss and, depending on the player, the mechanics can be fairly different. Players only have so many buttons to work with (less so these days than of expansions prior) so you stating that they're some infinitesimally complicated thing is foolish. They're not. They're simply much harder than a raid boss in the higher circumstances (because some players will never be able to beat certain others no matter how hard they try) and therefore, should offer better rewards through PvP. Going into a casual BG and showing off this gear and title is for fun. Sometimes, gladiators want to go into PvP casually with their stuff and have fun beating on players who are bold enough to attempt a fight. Like I said before, if people want to fight glads in undergeared circumstances, have them be able to queue into it by selecting an option that doesn't take their gear into account when queuing for a BG.<br />
<br />
You could do all this, or try to justify eliminating gear and be lazy. It won't work because it's a theory, and practically it's garbage. Additionally, arena tournament realms actually have differentiating gear and required ranking for such. Most PvP realmed private servers actually do incentivize with better gear in PvP, and custom PvP gear at that.</div></div><hr />

Why is being capable of 2/3 shotting someone just starting out or someone rolling an alt so god damn important? In the current system, after a few seasons deep into the expansion someone who came back from a break or just starting out would have a miserable time just trying to casually gear up because the power creep between them and someone who had been playing the whole time would be massive. Not even that the person they were playing against was 2200+ and mechanically better than them in every way. That person could have simply just afk'ed BGs for a while and been in full conquest by that time. Right now that pleb who afk grinds BGs will end up with the same exact gear, stats wise, as someone who worked their way to gladiator rank. The only difference between them being their own mechanical skill. <br />

In the new system, there will be a power creep. The gap between those who have been playing the whole time just won't be so fucking massive as it is now for newer players, which is the whole point. You get stronger gear with the level of progression you push for, so even those who are pushing beyond the 2200 mark will probably have better gear than those who just afk BG's for long enough for once. Won't that be nice that those who actually grind ladder will now have something to separate themselves other than a recolor set of gear? <br />
<br />
The only difference in this whole situation is some people have this unreasonable expectation that they should be allowed to curb stomp new players or players re-rolling to an alt to mess around on. Just because you played the game from the expansions inception, doesn't entitle you to make someone else's game play unreasonably miserable for your own enjoyment. If your only desire to PvP lies in being able to zero on on a squishy in a random, unrated BG. Then just go gank people leveling because this system, if balanced correctly, should improve the PvP scene in nearly every way.</div></div><hr />

Aah bingo. Balancing and Blizzard in one sentence is quite funny. The new PvP system will boil down to fotm and nothing more. Better start leveling up them alts.</div></div><hr />

Why is being capable of 2/3 shotting someone just starting out or someone rolling an alt so god damn important? In the current system, after a few seasons deep into the expansion someone who came back from a break or just starting out would have a miserable time just trying to casually gear up because the power creep between them and someone who had been playing the whole time would be massive. Not even that the person they were playing against was 2200+ and mechanically better than them in every way. That person could have simply just afk'ed BGs for a while and been in full conquest by that time. Right now that pleb who afk grinds BGs will end up with the same exact gear, stats wise, as someone who worked their way to gladiator rank. The only difference between them being their own mechanical skill. <br />

I don't know if you realize this, but the goal of every single game is to make the opponent's lives as miserable as possible. that's the goal in fighting games, mobas, and RPG's. You're also forgetting that there are certain people who actually enjoy switching to blues and still beating someone's ass. That is great. Again, to the whole solution that certain people who gear in honor, leave, and come back much later in the xpac:<br />
<br />
Have honor gear work like heirlooms but rather than scale off of level, scale with the current PvP season. This way, there's no grind for someone who's already grinded.<br />
<br />
Season 1? Honor gear Item level 100. Conquest 135. 2200 gear 140.<br />
Season 2? Previous honor gear bumps up to 130. Previous conquest stays at 135. New conquest is 150. Old 2200 is still 140. New is 155/160.<br />
<br />
Problem solved.<br />
<br />
The entire problem is right there in your response - a pleb AFK'er has the same gear as someone who's 2200. That could be avoided if the gear actually had standards again. Remember the days of each piece of armor requiring a specific rating? I do. Got rid of the ability for people to AFK and still get gear.</div></div><hr />

The goal is to kill NPC raid bosses. What helps with that? Gear and skill.<br />
<br />
You're trying to justify eliminating one and not the other. Why? Laziness.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The goal of PvE is not to kill raid bosses. The goal of PvE is to be the most powerful hero of the land. PvP goal is to be the most skilled player of the land.<br />
<br />
PvE requires gear, PvP requires skill. Different goals.<br />
<br />
Rewarding PvP players with gear basically makes PvP easier for those of the higher gear levels. The more gear you get the easier it becomes but that is counter to what PvP should be about. PvP should always be about skill first. Remove gear and the PvP brackets will change quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if they don't nail the balancing perfectly, it's still an improvement over the current system. Literally the only people being hurt by this are those who's sole goal in PvP is to completely shit down the necks of people who have near impossible chance of fighting back. If you want to be feel like a god damn unkillable monster, then just go gank lowbies for fucks sake. Stop trying to act like you're entitled to trounce people simply because you never took a break or never roll an alt. <br />
<br />
And as far as the other guy saying that every game is about making an opponent feel as miserable as possible is concerned.. That's just piss poor attitude to have towards anything competitive. There is supposed to be sportsmanship when doing anything competitive, gaming included. I guess I am just a different breed but there are only so many times I can play a game or a certain difficulty when there is absolutely no challenge involved anymore. That's why I don't play street fighter/mortal kombat on beginner or any of the sports games on rookie or even playing on torment 1 when capable of doing torment 8+ in Diablo. <br />
<br />
Let's just cut the bullshit and call a spade a spade. If you are advocating for the right to be able to stomp undergeared/new players then just do so. Allow yourself and the others who agree with you stand together and find out once and for all if your group outnumbers the rest of us enough to have Blizzard keep it the same. I would be willing to wager you're a minority and while your opinions and feelings matter, for the rest of us it's a counter-intuitive way to play the game and are glad it's going to be diminished finally.</div></div><hr />

Any PvER upset about this, just go kill more raid bosses and pretend the world cares about your &quot;accomplishments&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Power = skill. Thank you and good night. Euphemisms in an attempt to spot a nonexistent difference doesn't help your argument.<br />
<br />
PvP and PvE both seek to be the best at said thing. What helps achieve that? Skill and gear in tandem. You can be &quot;powerful&quot; (lol) without gear.<br />
<br />
Rewarding PvP players with gear makes it easier for people at higher levels? What? If two high rated people have the same gear with bigger numbers, the game play becomes faster not slower. Better gear takes more skill if anything. Higher haste, crit, mastery - all make the game move at a faster pace rather than a slower one, meaning that one must react faster and be better to play with people that have the same high level gear. Split second decisions and casts must be made quicker than before because the consequences for not doing so could result in a dead teammate even faster.<br />

and they clearly say that that the pvp system (the spec template and talents) will also work in open world pvp. So, no, the maximum advantage a raider can have is 2.5% better stats, which by themselves won't 1 shot anyone. On top that, the non raider will have pvp talents to use against the raider.<br />

The pvp sounds terrible. You have no incentive to pvp. Better gear? Nope. Not ever going to hit anyone harder than X percent of their health. That's not fun. So people cannot get a gear advantage they'll just all swarm OP classes. I enjoy crushing noobs and being rewarded for more work. Why pvp if im not ever going to get stronger. You will most likely be able to unlock all of your pvp talents within a week and those aren't going to make you OP to anyone. I'll just roll whatever is top damage in bgs and whats facerolling me in arenas. Thanks Blizzard, this is what we wanted. 25% right now feels fine. You can't go from 11 expansions of being stronger in pvp to just making everything rock paper scissors. Everything. You can't ever be a beast and 1v3 anyone because you had awesome gear you worked for. You're just going to kill one and then almost be dead because youre equally as powerful as this dippshit who never pvp's but can hit the buttons that light up. <br />
<br />
What a joke.<br />
<br />
dotn forget boss drops = gear! not only will raiders earn bis gear for any and all pvp they will earn it faster then you.im telling you guys read up on rifts f'ed up system thats all blizz is doing copying it and it will have the same effect = killing off open world pvp and most of pvp itself.</div></div><hr />
