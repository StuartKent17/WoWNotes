<br />
General<br />
<br />
Much of the data being downloaded in patch 4.0.3 will pave the way for the shattering of Azeroth shortly before the release of World of Warcraft: Cataclysm on December 7.<br />
The leader of Wintergrasp raids can no longer kick players from the raid (this change will also apply to Tol Barad in Cataclysm).<br />
When in a Looking For Dungeon group, using an instance portal to that instance will now take players to the Looking For Dungeon entrance point instead of the normal destination of that portal. This will make it easier to return to the instance after dying in an LFD group.<br />
Honorable Kills are no longer awarded for killing players below level 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
<br />
Added pets to the new raid unit frames when displayed in party.<br />
The default UI Scale has been altered so it will be set at a 1:1 pixel/texel ratio. This will result in a smaller UI appearance for higher resolution monitors.<br />
Players may now adjust the local &quot;Lag Tolerance&quot; time for better precision of spell timing. This is an advanced-users-only feature found in the Interface Options (Combat) panel.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
Macros now handle spell variant transitions better. For example, Trap Launcher causes a different version of Frost Trap to be cast. Previously the macro system was not handling this transition properly.<br />
Queuing in Looking For Dungeon for a different wing of the instance a player is already in now works properly. For example, a party can now queue for Scarlet Monastery - Library after completing Scarlet Monastery - Graveyard.<br />
Killing High Interrogator Gerstahn before killing Emperor Dagran Thaurissan in a Blackrock Depths - Upper City random Looking For Dungeon run will now provide the proper reward. This also applies to Archmage Arugal and the Crown Chemical Company bosses in Shadowfang Keep during the Love is in the Air holiday event.<br />
Repeatedly inspecting other players should now function correctly.<br />
Area heal-over-time effects should no longer cause players to stand up.<br />
Male blood elves have received a crash course in dancing and now know to stop dancing when they run.<br />
Drake mounts have gotten bored with gliding and will flap their wings again when flying forward.<br />
Druid Flight Form now properly appears in the Spellbook before Expert Riding is learned.<br />
Sunfire's damage-over-time effect now deals damage at the same rate as Moonfire's damage- over-time effect.<br />
GM Ticket messages should now displace buff icons instead of obscuring them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Tier 11 Models Preview - All races / Classes / Gender<br />
I've been doing Armor Sets previews for years, and I'm always surprised by how much time I have to spend on it. I know I promised it before the end of last week but ... Monday is close enough, and I'm totally blaming it on the new races/classes conditions! <br />
<br />
Most of the screenshots should match the in-game models, except for a few bugs (T11 Priest on female gnomes) but 99% of it is just fine at this point. Races are always screenshoted in the following order: Human, Dwarf, Night Elf, Draenei, Worgen, Gnome, Orc, Troll, Goblin, Undead, Tauren, Blood Elf<br />

Afaik, none of the WotLK mounts are being removed. However those that have a guaranteed drop currently, will likely be reduced to something around 1%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No changes to current game content are coming with 4.03. It's just basically the pre-download of 4.03a, which will then see pretty much all of the pre-Cata changes implemented.<br />
<br />
I'm personally hoping that Invincible/Mimi's Head drop rates don't change until Cata is out, but if Wrath is anything to go by, they will be with the final patch before release.</div></div><hr />

I would imagine it means that if for example you die in Halls of Reflection, entering any of the 3 portals that are there (Pit of Saron, Forge of Souls) will now take you to the instance that you chose via the LFD tool. Very handy for multi point instances like that, or also like Steamvault/Slave Pens/Underbog, which are easy to forget which portal is which.</div></div><hr />

I agree male Worgen looking solid. No way can they make the helmets looks decent without exposing their faces, but the way they did it works well, the Worgen Mage set looks wicked, as does the Druid.</div></div><hr />

I think this is for instances that are split into multiple parts when using LFD. Like Mara having 2 starting points in the LFD or BRD having 2-3(?) starting points. Instead of just starting at the beginning of the instance when you re-enter you will actually start at the point the LFD put you at originally.</div></div><hr />

This patch is just giving us the files needed for the Shattering. Think of it as phasing: when 4.0.1a hits, the world will phase into the Shattered version, mounts will change, and elemental bosses will finally be here.<br />
<br />
All this patch is doing is making the day 4.0.3a hits is making sure we already have the files needed, and making it all go more smoothly than previous patch days, although I have my doubts that maintenance will be done by the first time stated that day... expect a few hours of delay.<br />

whatabout class/race ? would that be on 4.0.3 too?<br />

You won't get either till you have Cata installed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does 4.03 bring new race/class combos? If so, I have my work cut out for me these coming weeks.<br />
<br />
Again, you won't have either till you have Cata installed. Race/class combos work the same way that races and DK's do. You have to have BC for Blood Elves/Draenei, and WotLK for DK's. This also means you HAVE to have Cata for race/class combos and Goblins/Worgens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is true, and some sets look fine on humans (DK, mage, warrior). But consider all the other Human classes. Human Hunters look awful compared to, say, their Worgen or Night Elf counterparts. The Warlock gear still isn't great, but it looks much, much better on almost every other race. Rogue, same deal: not great, but many other races do it justice (dare I say gnomes and goblins even look *good* in it).<br />
<br />
One thing that really irks me about humans, at least in the previews, is their slouchy posture. The other thing, and this applies to any of the taller races, is how the shoulders pop so far out from the actual body geometry. Look at gnomes and goblins and notice how their shoulder pieces don't pop so much, and also notice how that makes them look less stupid.<br />
<br />

I'm pretty sure you're wrong about the race/class bit. Worgen/Goblins won't be available till Cataclysm, but I am nearly positive that Race/class changes for existing races are coming with 4.03a. Otherwise your rant is well done.</div></div><hr />

They were asking about the new race/class combos (e.g., tauren paladins, night elf mages, etc.) NOT the new races (Worgen/Goblin). We do get the race/class combos prior to Cata on 12/7.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, this is not true. New race/class combos (excepting all Goblins and Worgen of course) are part of 4.0.3a, for everybody. You do not have to have Cataclysm to play a Tauren Paladin. This has been stated multiple times by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

The world will not be changing in patch 4.0.1. We are planning to apply those changes in patch 4.0.3 shortly before Cataclysm launch.<br />
<br />
[...] New race/class combinations and changes to the old world (including quests) should be patch 4.0.3. I know it's kind of confusing since we typically release one major patch right before the release of the next expansion. In this case, many of the systems changes will be added in 4.0.1, while a lot of content changes will be added in 4.0.3.<br />
<br />
The expansion will then provide players with access to the new races, new zones, level 85 cap, flight in Azeroth, Archaeology, etc.</div></div><hr />

Was that written before or after the introduction of the 4.0.3a patch? I hope they won't change the quests until 4.0.3a, I'm only a few quests away from loremaster...</div></div><hr />

well dont think so, next week is the WoW's 6th Anniversary week dont think there will be any patch that week, patch 4.0.3a will proberly come 30. nov in us and 1 dec. in eu:)</div></div><hr />

Deliberately making the draenei robes shorter than robes for other races, only makes it look like The United Tailor Union of Azeroth is operating on a &quot;one size fits all&quot; basis. But if you look -really- closely, you'll notice that draeneis are taller than most other races. So please Blizzard, give us longer robes!<br />
<br />
Speak for yourself. I very much like my hooves to be visible. Besides, that way the robe doesn't get dirty.</div></div><hr />

I thought the hunter was mediocre before, but I love this picture. And the worgen mage looks far better than the skull. Much more impressed with rogue here than previously.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Warlocks don't look as good close up as they did from a distance, and Shaman still looks very generic.</div></div><hr />

the worgen mages looks quite silly with just that half helm... they dont even look cool or even as close to evil compared to the other mages..<br />
its just slacky of the devs if that is the final version of the mage helm for worgens<br />
<br />
and the priest shoulders for male taurens.... just look at the size of them, think they could have design them abit better<br />
<br />
and the lock set got me quite disapointed.. looks more like some ugly wresting clown suit, duno who came up with that set but he/she should realy think twice before designing another one...</div></div><hr />

I'm positive the snout is NOT visible in-game. This is an issue that has always been present in wow model viewer, ears and hair that are normally not visible in-game would be visible in the model viewer when the helm is equipped, which is why there is an option to remove the hair and ears from a character. There is most likely no &quot;view snout&quot; option to turn off, and thus their snout remains visible through the helm, although this is likely not the case in-game.</div></div><hr />

They still need to change the eyes in the first place. They look ridiculous and out of place, even without the helmet.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes with the LFD tool you don't start at the very beginning of an instance, you will start in the middle. I think this means that when you are in one of those particular instances, when you go back to the portal for the dungeon it will put you back at the LFD start of the dungeon instead of the technical start of the dungeon.</div></div><hr />

Eh, I liked the soaring. I thought they didn't soar enough before, I just hope they made it a nice balance between the two, especially if you are just flying in a straight line and not up or down.</div></div><hr />
