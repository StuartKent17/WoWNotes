Class balance as of Oct 13, 2010<br />
Rather than try and address multiple threads, I'm just going to plop our current thoughts in this one post. Please excuse the brevity.<br />
<br />
1) We think Fury, Arms, Feral cat and Retribution dps is too low and we will be buffing them.<br />
<br />
2) We think mage dps is too high, especially Fire, and will be nerfing it.<br />
<br />
3) We think Shadow priest dps is too high, but that's largely a result of Shadow Word: Death spam, which is tough on healers. We'll be fixing that.<br />
<br />
4) We think Destro warlock dps is too high, but that's largely a result of Searing Pain spam, which is tough on tanks. We'll be fixing that.<br />
<br />
5) As we suspected, PvP dps is just too high given that the health pools of Cataclysm haven't kicked in yet. While competitive PvP is over for the moment, we still want the environment to feel better so we will be buffing resilience. This change might be reverted at level 85.<br />
<br />
There will probably be more changes after another night of raiding and BGs. Many of the bug fixes we have made today will affect dps as well. Stay tuned. <br />
<br />
<br />
Missing Enchantments<br />
Since the release of patch 4.0.1 yesterday, we’ve received reports from players that a few of their item enchantments are now missing. After further investigation into the cause and potential solutions, we’ve come to the unfortunate conclusion that we will not be able to restore these enchantments.<br />
<br />
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, but we will not be able to replace or otherwise reimburse players for their lost enchantments. <br />
<br />
<br />
Mount Speed in Patch 3.1.0<br />
To clarify my original post, when I said no changes were being made to mounts in 4.0.1, I was referring to the idea of mounts being removed or droprates changed. No mounts have been removed as of yet, nor have any droprates been altered.<br />
<br />
With that said, 310% speed is now solely obtained by purchasing the skill. All mounts now go the speed of your highest skill level. So if you happen to obtain Invincible now and have nothing higher than Expert riding, you will travel 150% speed. If you have Artisan riding the mount will be 280%. In order for the mount to travel 310% speed for anyone who obtains it after 4.0.1, you will need to purchase the new Master riding skill. Anyone who had a 310% mount prior to patch 4.0.1 automatically learned Master riding. <br />
<br />
[...] There are no 310% mounts anymore. 310% speed is now obtained via Master riding, a new flying skill. All flying mounts are now only distinguished by aesthetics. <br />
<br />
<br />
Update: Renamed Warlock Pets<br />
…the ritual came to a close and a demon of untold power (but limited stature) was pulled through the void, kicking and biting and gnashing its teeth, forcibly bound to the mortal world. The warlock, a quizzical expression on his face, regarded his familiar, who was in fact now quite unfamiliar, and inquired, “Who in the hell are you?”<br />
<br />
Since the release of 4.0.1, more than a few warlocks have noticed that their pets are in fact no longer their familiar demonic servants, and instead appear to be new entities with different names. We’ve been able to pinpoint the cause of the issue, which should be resolved by tomorrow for any warlocks that log in for the first time from then on. We’ve also been able to determine that we will be able to restore any renamed warlock pets to their original pre-4.0.1 names during next week’s scheduled maintenance.<br />
<br />
For those of you who like your new pet names, we’re working on a feature for a future patch that will allow you to refresh your summons and essentially generate a random pet name without having to level a new warlock. <br />
<br />
<br />
Guild - &quot;Requires Authenticator&quot; Ranks<br />
For those of you reporting issues promoting or demoting guild members to a rank that has the &quot;Requires an Authenticator&quot; permission enabled, I have a bit more information for you.<br />
<br />
As noted in the main post, if a player attaches an Authenticator to his or her Battle.net account, it may take a few days before guild controls will recognize the Authenticator and allow that player's characters to be moved to a protected guild rank. Since this feature is new with patch 4.0.1, though, this sort of &quot;checking&quot; has to occur globally—so it'll be roughly 72 hours from the first time a character logs in after patching before it will be eligible for an Authenticator-required rank. This wait period will still apply even if a player has had an Authenticator attached to their account for months (or even years).<br />
<br />
Apologies for the confusion! <br />
<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Class Balance<br />
We are continuing to adjust balance. We have made several changes already today that players will notice. We have to be cautious about these things. We don't want to massively buff someone whose low damage is caused by a bug. We don't want to say nerf Fire mage crit chance now only to have it be too low when they start to level. We don't want to buff classes now only to have to turn around and nerf them at 85. Some of the issues we're observing now were not happening on our internal servers, the beta or the PTR. It's a very complicated game, and that's totally par for the course.<br />
<br />
But we are making some changes, and many of them quickly. The patch has just barely been live for 24 hours now. It was a pretty major patch in terms of game mechanics changes, and as always when this happens, we have problems that crop up and need to be addressed. The fact that groups were able to raid at all after such a major patch is pretty remarkable. I am personally very sorry for anyone who is so upset about their current dps that they would quit after years of play. We'll get things worked out.

<br />
&quot;Play&quot; button sound in the Launcher<br />
I jumped out of my chair yesterday when I hit the Play button to check on something in the game. This isn't an intended heart-rate check and we're looking to get it fixed in an upcoming patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27187855935/press-play-gong/))<br />
<br />
Raid Bugs<br />
<br />
Toravon the Ice Watcher will now spawn properly. A hotfix for this issue has been deployed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27187854547/voa-toravon/))<br />
A hotfix for the targeting issues with Festergut and Putricide is currently being deployed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27191402115/icc-bugs-so-far/))<br />
Lady Deathwhisper's mana pool should be back to normal now. We've deployed a hotfix for that issue. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27191402115/icc-bugs-so-far/))<br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Prologue Event<br />
Things have started already, but they are just the first of the events leading up to Cataclysm. You may want to go to the major cities and hear what your leaders are up to. You also may want to make sure your earthquake kits are up to date too, you may start feeling the earth move under your feet.<br />
<br />
Everything is not going to happen at once and we don't want to give away any surprises. You'll just have to keep your eyes and ears open as we march on toward December 7th. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27191403598/where-is-the-4-0-1-pre-launch-event/))<br />
<br />
Enemy Nameplates missing<br />
Sorry for the late response. We are aware of this and looking into a fix. This can't be hotfixed, so a client side fix would have to be used for this issue. Sorry for the inconvenience. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27188062976/bug-enemy-nameplates/))<br />

New Tree of Life<br />
Art is very subjective. We're very used to the phenomenon of half of a class loving say their tier set art and the other half thinking they are the worst thing ever.<br />
<br />
Messing with player models is always risky and we know the current Tree of Life model is one of those things that is either loved or hated. That is why, as promised, we are offering a minor glyph if you just prefer the older, treant-based, version of ToL.

So it looks like I'll be focusing on my Druid and Priest more in Cataclysm. My poor shammy. <br />

<br />
As for the Shaman, don't judge it until you see it in motion. It may look pretty plain now, but considering most of the sets (especially shoulders) have some sort of effect on them, it may very well be more complex than that. And if not, too bad, payback for T10 shoulders.</div></div><hr />

Except the shaman. God half the time I look at the new Tier previews and think its a joke.<br />
Do the artists look at what they made after and actually think its good? I mean do they even compare it to the other sets like mage? I just don't understand why they don't realize when they make ridiculous looking sets. (Edit: I'm an artist and I would never let a product go out looking as lame as some of the armors they create. Specially endgame gear)<br />
Idk QQ<br />

First of all, that's pretty sad that you choose which classes you play based on tier gear. If you're that vain, why not just play in RP gear, and to hell with stats?<br />
<br />
Secondly, I see NO similarity between mage T11 and lock T7 helms. Seriously, are you blind? Tusken raider looks like Skeletor in what way?</div></div><hr />

So...priest run around with fountains of holy water?...k.. what's with the size? Why are the fountains not above shoulders but beside the shoulders? They look, size-wise, like something an orc would wear.<br />
Smaller plz...<br />
<br />
Except for the skull part of the helm, mage set looks bad. random horns on shoulders, a bit of glow, looks like a blue set if u were to remove that glow.<br />
<br />
So far, only druid set looks ok (shoulders are awesome), I dread what will see on pala n dk...<br />
<br />
Shaman...looks like a blue set, has 3 horns on shoulders (how creative) a tiny bit of glow, seriously if anyone likes that set, I feel sorry for you.</div></div><hr />

That's like saying that other than the spiciness, peppers taste just like apples. The skull part MAKES the mage set, it needs nothing else, as the skull face would only distract from it. I'll be honest, I didn't even notice it had shoulders I was so caught up in the badassery of the Skeletor look.<br />
<br />
...sigh, just have to take a deep breath, and tell myself that there is no accounting for taste. There, I feel better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Secondly, I see NO similarity between mage T11 and lock T7 helms. Seriously, are you blind? Tusken raider looks like Skeletor in what way?<br />
<br />
well i dont kno where he got t7 from, but t11 mage helm is definately a reskinned wrathful lock helm</div></div><hr />

You need to take a look at Warlock T5, Warrior T3, Paladin T2 etc and realize that some of us out there, don't want just 1 set piece to look good while the rest look crap.<br />
<br />
If u look past the skull, the rest is a badly designed shaman set..</div></div><hr />

Mage armor is on fire with horns, Priest has fountains, you realize that the armor is supposed to be of cloth? Wouldn't Mage burn himself to death?^^ But I'd welcome the wet T-Shirt look on my priest though.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Play&quot; button sound in the Launcher<br />
I jumped out of my chair yesterday when I hit the Play button to check on something in the game. This isn't an intended heart-rate check and we're looking to get it fixed in an upcoming patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27187855935/press-play-gong/))<br />
<br />
<br />
There´s a fix for this in Windows 7 atleast (maybe Vista too, haven´t run it so not sure how it works)<br />
Start the Launcher and await the lovely sound, then open up Windows Volume Mixer, click the volume icon in <br />
your systemtray and choose &quot;Open Volume Mixer&quot; ( or Windowsbutton + R, sndvol.exe).<br />
should see a Blizzard Launcher in there, or scroll to it if needed, drag the bar down, done! No sound for<br />
the launcher, but you still get sound ingame.<br />
<br />
Or... i just tried the launcher and there was a small update, and i cant hear the plong anymore so.. i guess they fixed it in the little patch :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yeah... that is utter crap! i´ve done the achievement, but can imagine how many it will piss off now with that stunt.<br />
Imo that achievement should bloody well still reward the mount!<br />
My better part is just 2 achievements short on that mount, spread on 2 world events... she will not be happy. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
The changes are good. I heard that fire mages were doing exceptionally well, although with my craptastic gear I haven't noticed much of a difference. It's just good that they are addressing these issues. Part of the reason fire mages are doing such high dps is probably because of the temporary prime/major glyph fix after they stuffed our primes up. We can essentially have four or five prime glyphs at once. &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

Actually, for the mage set, its modeled after Ragnaros. The skull, even the horns on the shoulders. Even the set name &quot;Firelord's Vestments&quot; is a throwback to the good ol Rag.</div></div><hr />

...I'm so leveling an orc or undead mage come December 7th. The shaman set looks woefully plain beside everything that's been revealed so far, but I guess it's comeuppance for having easily the coolest-looking t10.

I can see the need to fix dps issues and will be modest, my fire mage has been pumping out some legit OP dps. Id like to state that i really like what has happend with with arcane/ and hope that it doesnt suffer the nerf bat as hard as fire and frost. MOST IMPORTANT, is again in all modesty, i believe druid boomkins and hunters need to be looked at as well, for the sheer fact they are Easily out dpsing me with 10 to 15k dps in raids. If mages must suffer the nerf then it is only fair they too be looked at. TY</div></div><hr />

And using Human models to display the armor is not helping the situation at all, as they have the worst model in the game, by far. It was better when Boub used BELF even.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only cool thing about the mage set is the skull helmet and in my opinion it just doesn't fit to a mage. Should be the warlocks helmet and not these crappy masks that the lock t11 now has.<br />
<br />
At the first look, i thought that the priest set is totally screwed up ... but without the arabian style helmet it is pretty sweet and together with warrior set my favorite of the shown sets.<br />
<br />
And the dk helmet .... looks okay. I like the skull theme but these ram like horns on it ... i hope it won't look like the warrior t8. Anyway i won't display the helmet as i'm playing female undead!<br />
<br />

It would have been a great set for locks since the fire could be red for destro, green for demon, and purple for affl. I mean if it is like tier 11 point whatever, it could just be leaning towards each spec.<br />
<br />
warlocks have had amazing looking gear every tier since tier 2, like probably the best looking out of all classes every tier...can we have this one? stop being greedy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mages are awesome other than the yellow glow. Give them a glow that changes with the color of the set, or a different color. The yellow glow only looks good with the Fire Based design.<br />
<br />
With that said, I am very happy to see the armor taking the specs colors into play. Great job Blizzard on Mages.<br />
<br />
Shamans, these look like redesigned Druid gear that still need something added to make them stand out more. Shoulders are awesome, just the robes and gloves need something else.<br />
<br />
Death Knight's Helm, surprised with the design, but liking it other than one thing. The Fire Helm... NO Death Knights have nothing to do with Fire at all. We are known for three things... Green - Unholy Blue - Frost Red - Blood, not Orange for Fire! Make that change, make it Blood Red and you have full wins here!</div></div><hr />

For five years my friends and I joked about how mages needed water coolers on their shoulders-- and it appears the priests were the ones to get it in the end. Amusing. (I really do like the priest set).<br />
I'm shocked that they're talking about balancing DPS right now... unless they're really starting to see issues in the Cata beta with numbers also... ret was defintely low at 85, but that's really the only one I noticed.<br />
I will say, T9-geared rogue (combat) using two-251 weapons and only pulling 3K dps (using cooldowns as much as possible) was pretty disappointing. That being said, I watched an assasin-built rogue in VoA10 do 10K dps (sustained) against Toravon. So I don't know if the &quot;ALL rogues are broken&quot; cry is entirely true... but there's some inconsistancy that may need to be addressed.<br />
I hope they leave elemental shams as-is though. The rotation is a bit different and I'm really enjoying it. And I'm putting out some wicked DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you had a 310% mount BEFORE the patch you were given 310% speed. What they're saying is now all game mounts henceforth will only scale with the speed you have trained. That means if you go find a phoenix or get an invincible now that the patch is released it will be usable at your current speed. You need to buy 310% speed to fly faster. Good news is you can now use all of your mounts at any speed (so some dont get neglected) bad news is its another 5k unless you were lucky to get a 310% before the patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're reading it a little wrong. If you already had a 310% mount before the patch, you don't have to pay. You learned the skill automatically.<br />
<br />
If you did NOT have a 310% mount before the patch, you have to pay 5k to get 310% speed, even if you acquire a mount that used to be 310%. Speed is now based on what level of riding skill you have, not the mount.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jd5</div><div class="date">2010-10-14, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) We think Fury, Arms, Feral cat and Retribution dps is too low and we will be buffing them.<br />
<br />
Your missing one, MM. OK not entirely as bad as the others, but dps on MM hunters has dropped noticeably IMO.<br />
<br />
What is the connection between all these specs you ask?!?<br />
<br />
ARP.<br />
<br />
The simple fact of removing a *major* component of damage for all these specs and not compensating for it is what made all these classes dps drop like a rock. Not to mention the limited to no compensation for the removal of attack power as well, which effects Feral's the worst due to the loss of feral attack power on weapons (my Feral lost 3k+ overall). They need to add some form of built-in ARP ability to these classes (instead of simply buffing damage as it will most likely just need a nerf when everyone is 85 and decked out - and is also gaining the full benefit of mastery on top of that). A slight bump to weapon damage (similar to the spell power bump for casters) wouldn't hurt also to cover the loss of attack power.<br />
<br />
And before someone says it, yes I know Ret's don't use ARP... they are the exception to the rule. One part people needing to learn the new mechanics and one part the time it takes to set up TV (which is supposed to be our &quot;big&quot; damage ability) while still working thru the rest of our rotation, it's taking people a little time to adjust. Easiest way IMO to give them a little extra umph would be to bring back some holy damage to some of their attacks, seeing as that extra spell damage component is keeping both Enh Shammy's and DK's doing decent dps even tho' the are also melee specs/classes.</div></div><hr />
