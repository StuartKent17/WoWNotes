Alpha Realm Maintenance - 12/14<br />
As some of you may have noticed, the Alpha realms have been shut down for maintenance in order to deploy a new alpha build. We are currently expecting the realms to be available sometime tomorrow. I'll update this post tomorrow when we have a clearer ETA. Thank you for your patience.<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
What do you say to the ol' 10m guilds that couldn't (or wouldn't)recruit 10 more for Mythic and are calling for 10m 2 return?<br />
I was in a 40-person guild, and we had to tell some folks they likely wouldn't be raiding much. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/674766946634620928))<br />
My point is, it's hard to give everyone the precise experience they are looking for. But that doesn't make it easier on them. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/674767131855077378))<br />
<br />
Love Undercity and the ruins of Lordaeron above and Varimathras, Any cool cities that were scrapped? https://t.co/9hz1NMXkPo<br />
As a lover of all things Underdark, I lament that Azjol was reduced to only a couple of dungeons. Maybe someday? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/675135159159660544))<br />
<br />
I grew up playing all the &quot;classic&quot; RTS games of the late 90s/early 00's (AoE, C&amp;C, Starcraft, Warcraft etc.) I have a lot of nostalgia for the genre and I feel like a lot of other people do too. What do you think classic RTS could do, if anything, to make a comeback?<br />
I think you have to ooze charm. I'll mention Age of Empires, not because I think it's the best RTS in every aspect, but it did a great job with the charm that hooked people in...<br />
<br />
The fishing villagers carried a giant, flopping fish.<br />
The big cats would sometimes hunt down the gazelle.<br />
It was fun to place the walls around your town.<br />
The priest said Wololo. <br />

Songs of Azeroth<br />
AFK PL@YERS has released a video celebrating the 10th anniversary of WoW Taiwan. You may remember their work from their Blizzcon 2013 winning entry (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXtMj59Tr4).<br />

Yeah, for something that is supposed to come from an old god, I think that most of them don't look &quot;organic&quot; enough. <br />
It's just a blade. Double edged sharp one at that, as if a caster would want to slash things all the time.</div></div><hr />

A ritual sacificial dagger makes more sense than a ritual sacrificial staff though.<br />

Casting animations for shadow priest always felt wrong, the shadow priest magic is about the mind... a dark telepathy that rips peoples brains apart and melts their faces metaphysically. So instead of any weapon that we never actually use to stab/melt.<br />
<br />
The Old Gods and the Faceless never used weapons and the only the bug races started to use weapons and even then they werent brillaint (the least favourite game model imo, bug parts blah!)<br />
<br />
If I had to choose a weapon, a Wand. Why wasnt a wand put up as an option for weapon, we used to have them and they could make a comeback especially with a slight tweak of the animations imo.<br />
Better yet, not a weapon, a Halo... with a Mind Gem inside. The halo is an animation (like the lock skull) floating over the priests head... different crown like shapes and glows. Look cooler imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a fair counterpoint, I've just seen so much QQ about the legendary ring being &quot;mandatory&quot; and therefore LFR is somehow &quot;mandatory&quot; that the change surprised me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, for something that is supposed to come from an old god, I think that most of them don't look &quot;organic&quot; enough. <br />
It's just a blade. Double edged sharp one at that, as if a caster would want to slash things all the time.<br />
<br />
Ironic that a caster gets a sharp weapon, when for 2-3 expansions now melee have been dealing with huge blunt-edged swords/stoneworks/etc.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Or something tentacle-related. There's a weapon drop in Hour of Twilight (I think?) Cata 5-man heroic that was a wriggling tentacle. Was really surprised they didn't go that route, as it's fairly obvious.<br />
<br />
OR they could have done like with demo locks (demon skull) and just made the weapon a void tendril that erupts from an arm or shoulder or something. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'd trade the Sub Daggers for the Spriest Dagger :/<br />
<br />
Right? Sub is so underwhelming and doesn't look like a &quot;subtle&quot; weapon at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not really a good argument, though, as staves are close-combat as well. The issue is that for casters, weapons are (and have been, since mana basically stopped mattering for everybody but healers in later Wrath) almost entirely a cosmetic buff-stick. Like, functionally, they might as well be bracers.<br />
<br />
Lore-wise, sacrificial dagger makes more sense as a void tool than a staff, although either would work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
one hand mace works just as good, if not better than a dagger, at least you can see it.<br />
<br />
One of the most Twilight/Old God related weapons in the game is a one hand mace, Twilights Hammer (http://www.wowhead.com/item=63680/twilights-hammer#comments)<br />
<br />
Most of the lore regarding the Talonpriests of Terokk all seems to deal with hammers or gavels. Terokk would break beaks with a hammer (ingame it's a str weapon, but you can use it as a priest for transmog).<br />
<br />
My issue with daggers, especially on casters is a) how small they are) b) your transmog options are only other daggers and c) when used on a caster they are on your sides while casting.<br />
<br />
If the artifact was a staff you could at least see it on your back clearly when casting, and there is a lot more staff options in the game for transmog with vastly different looks.</div></div><hr />

It's a sacrificial dagger, not one for stabbing hence the form of it also ( even if it's meant to be a claw also ) . I don't know why you guys want to have another staff , and good thing it's not a mace ! Also the dagger will have animations so it won't sit idle on your side like other daggers or maces. I don't know if the staves for disc and holy will have them also.</div></div><hr />
