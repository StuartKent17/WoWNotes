PvP Tuning Incoming - February 26<br />
Today, we’re working on hotfixes that will focus on two areas of concern.<br />
<br />
As we’ve monitored PvP matches since our PvP mana changes to healers and Restoration Druids, we’ve found that Lifebloom, as a source of healing, has become too-efficient. While the reduction to Focused Growth’s increased healing and mana cost savings is a sizeable change, Restoration Druids have a wide variety of well-performing PvP talent options to fit in its place.<br />
<br />
https://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#s))<br />
<br />
Restoration<br />
Focused Growth (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/203554-focused-growth) now reduces the mana cost of Lifebloom by 8% (was 20%).<br />
Focused Growth (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/203554-focused-growth) now increases the healing of Lifebloom by 8% per stack (was 20%).<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, we’ve identified an Azerite Trait that has been providing too much healing in an arena environment when multiple members of a team equip the trait.<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
Bonded Souls (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/288802-bonded-souls) healing reduced by 85% when engaged in combat with enemy players (was 50%).<br />
<br />
<br />
These changes are not live yet, but will be made live soon. I’ll update this post when the changes go live, and as always, you’ll see them noted in their final form in our next Hotfixes Update.</div></div><hr />

I have to disagree with you. Resto Druids have been insanely overpowered in the past few weeks. Thank you Blizzard, great changes. Keep it up &lt;3</div></div><hr />

So that was the only change needed?<br />
<br />
Just to clarify. Rdruid nerfs are only 1 of 100 things that needs tuning and has been needed for a very long time now.</div></div><hr />

If you want to nerf, nerf it to the death and keep like it! If you don't want, don't do it... But find the right place and stop! Every week something changes about resto druid pvp, every week... I really got enough of this..</div></div><hr />

That goes for all changes. I don't want to complain, but it feels like changes to everything keep happening and you can't count on anything and every time you have to rediscover stuff and adapt on the go. From classes to gear traits to mythic+ mob count and so on.</div></div><hr />

Really, though. Does Blizz not want people to play healers? They were fun and we were still short on healers, now they are killing all the fun and making it much harder to survive the burst. Its going to make lots of healers go bye bye.</div></div><hr />

sorry mate, i dont see a warrior or warlock or hunter or, or, or, any other class every damn week's change list. But i see druid!<br />
As i said before, i am not complaining about the nerf. i am complaining about the how frequent the changes are, nerf or buffs doesn't matter. <br />
Blizzard should stop with playing with resto druid every week. Especially the Focused Growth, i am really afraid of opening mmo-champion every week start:)</div></div><hr />

The point is, maybe, that there are other healers? Resto druid is always the best fucking healer in pvp, it's tiresome.<br />
With all the tools resto druids have, their healing should be lower than other healers. Holy priest should have insane healing in pvp as they have about zero tools, which is why they are never played.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, Druid healing right now is the best. You cant even use their tools anymore because of the mana changes. So like trying to Cyclone something, you lose too much mana. So people rarely CC anymore. Thats what its become. They made the mana regen so bad and cost so high, that all healers can do now is hope to heal. <br />
<br />
Its crazy because they nerf heals and then add in Maledict. Wtf. Just remove healers from PvP then.</div></div><hr />

The druids are really good in a caster meta and at the moment we have a pure caster meta. Almost all meele comps are B-C tier</div></div><hr />

I have to disagree with you here, druids are still spam cycloning like crazy.<br />
<br />
The main problem with druids is the ridiculous arsenal of tools they have. Stealth, stun, cyclone, vortex, roots, charge, poly-immunity. I'm sure I'm missing some out, but you ge the point: it's ridiculous to have so many things at your disposal. No other class has this crazy amount of useful things in their kits. And keep in mind I'm leaving out the 5+ &quot;O'SHIT&quot; buttons, Soothe, and the fact most of their heals are instant casts, which allow them to remain mobile most of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, let further elaborate. Resto Dru is good, mainly NE because you can Shadowmeld out of combat to get a drink. Because if you spam Cyclone, youre going to go oom very fast and not be able to heal. Resto Dru also has the best movement to hide and drink. The mana changes made them stronger for that fact alone. <br />
<br />
Resto Sham is still prob better heals but when they are oom they cant drink as easily as a Druid can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me neither, was allready the case in Legion, but this time around the hotfix are done even faster and in addition we have that accursed azerite system with a shitload of pvp hotfixes.<br />
<br />
That bonded souls hotfix came as a real shocker for me, because i was just playing unholy dk after several years again got an high ilvl azerite chest piece some hours today with bonded souls and thought...yeah haste + heal...all i need for that particular char, now, there is no heal to speak of thanks to some arena games played in a sandbox. How about they do such stuff only for arena, because i am sure this trait is perfectly fine with its innherent -50% heal, in warmode and bgs.<br />
Simply remove it and give me something worth of a choice then?<br />
<br />
Or even better, how about to return to reslience again and pvp power. The benefit of this old system that you could always know what was going on and it was transparent and applied some inner logic.<br />
<br />
But, maybe devs can't admit defeat of the new pvp system and also need to put back vendors so everyone got enough resilence and blizz had to abaddon their rng fetish.<br />
<br />
And thats not possible under the new legion+ direction...</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, Shamans time and time again have been the best healers in PvP for a long time. Even in BFA. Druid just became the strongest with these mana nerfs. Not saying, Resto Druid is weak, but Top Tier play has traditionally been owned by Resto Sham.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After 2k rating you will see drastic decrease of maledict's usefulness, as better healers almost always manage to dispell it before the proc.</div></div><hr />
