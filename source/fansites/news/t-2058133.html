What's Not Coming This Week?<br />
Mythic+ dungeons and raids aren't opening just yet, allowing time for everyone to level and gear up a little bit before the race is on.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Emerald Nightmare raid won't be available until Tuesday, September 20 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5925-Legion-Dungeons-and-Raids-Schedule-August-22-Hotfixes) when Normal and Heroic open.<br />
The Nighthold won't be open until early 2017 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5918-Gamescom-Developer-Q-A-Warcraft-Movie-Additional-Scene), meaning that you won't be able to obtain the Tier 19 armor sets until then. <br />
Mythic+ Dungeons won't be available until Mythic Keystones begin dropping on Tuesday, September 20 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5925-Legion-Dungeons-and-Raids-Schedule-August-22-Hotfixes).<br />
The new PvP season doesn't start until Tuesday, September 20. You can start earning honor and unlocking Honor Talents (http://www.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator) at launch though!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.0.3 Recap<br />
If you are just coming back, be sure to take a look at the Patch 7.0.3 recap for all of the system changes made to the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/august/703Recap.png (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5844-Patch-7-0-3-Live-This-Week) <br />
<br />
<br />
Artifact Weapons<br />
Artifacts are the only weapons you will be using in Legion. <br />
<br />
<br />
Artifact weapons are specific to each spec. You will select one to start with and then can acquire the weapons for your other spec at Level 102.<br />
Artifacts have a trait tree (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/318-Legion-Artifact-Weapons-Info#atrait) that requires Artifact Power (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/318-Legion-Artifact-Weapons-Info#ap) to fill out.<br />
The traits are mostly passive, powering up or modifying your existing class abilities. There are some activate traits that provide you with a new ability. <br />
Artifact Knowledge (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/318-Legion-Artifact-Weapons-Info#know) provides a multiplier to your Artifact Power gains. Knowledge comes from completing work orders.<br />
Relics (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/318-Legion-Artifact-Weapons-Info#relic) can drop or be crafted and are used to increase the item level of your Artifact, as well as granting another rank of a trait. <br />
Artifacts have five different models (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/318-Legion-Artifact-Weapons-Info#appear), with four color variations of each model. One of these models is hidden (www.mmo-champion.com/content/318-Legion-Artifact-Weapons-Info#hidden).<br />
Be sure to take a look at the Artifact calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator) to get familiar with your Artifact's traits.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Order Halls<br />
You will want to head to your Order Hall to work with your Artifact, manage missions, complete a campaign, and more!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Legendary Items<br />
There are new legendary armor items that can drop from many different sources in Legion.<br />
<br />
<br />
These legendary items are mostly specific to a class and spec, with your loot spec determining which legendary can drop. <br />
There is no way to target a specific legendary item. <br />
You can only equip one legendary item at the start of the expansion. This limit will be increased as time goes on.<br />
Each class has an Order Hall talent that allows them to equip a second legendary item.<br />
Some level of bad luck streak protection applies to legendary items.<br />
<br />

AskMrRobot Updates<br />
Our friends over at AskMrRobot (http://www.askmrrobot.com/) will be ready to launch with Legion, including their new simulator! <br />
<br />
<br />
The new site is launching when Legion goes live, midnight on August 30.<br />
It will initially support stat weights for single target fights, with more options coming soon. <br />
The simulator (http://beta.askmrrobot.com/wow/simulator/run) can help you to figure out the optimal Artifact path for the fights you are interested in. <br />
In the near future, your character profile page will show an estimate of the DPS you should be able to do. <br />
You can play with the simulator now (http://beta.askmrrobot.com/wow/simulator/run), using the help page (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/simulator-help/) if needed. <br />
There are some helpful tips on their blog here (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2016/08/important-low-level-items/).<br />

World Bosses<br />
Legion has a few of the 11 world bosses up at a time with a world quest associated with each boss. Some of the hidden Artifact appearances (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/318-Legion-Artifact-Weapons-Info#hidden) drop from these bosses!<br />

You're not the only one man. i only started playing in the end of cataclysm but that doesn't make me question what is legendary about an item everyone can -easily- get now. it's supposed to be a reward of exceptional skills, something not every player can get it, you basicly can get it from any mob you kill in legion now... this went from a reward for skill to a reward for luck.</div></div><hr />

I can't see why this sort of thinking matters, if anything people should be happier more and more people are becoming more and more better equipped just embrace the change it will make life easier for you.<br />

Wrong it will only drop at lvl 110 and only from Mythic Dungeons or Raid bosses, also again its only a colour pixel get over it, I could cry boohoo i remember when I worked for my epixs in vanilla but you know what I don't give a damned just enjoy the game for what it is and stop getting your panties in a bunch over something so pathetic.</div></div><hr />

First qurstion yes they are a PRE LAUNCH event when legión release good bye invasion <br />
<br />
Second you can xmog the artifact to any weapon of wow exept another artifact, so for your question NO</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can transmog artifacts, but you cannot use other artifact weapon appearances.<br />
<br />
So you can mog your artifact to a regular weapon, but you cannot mog anything to use an artifact's appearance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry that my post bothered you...I was just stating my opinion about the situation. I'm still excited about the new expansion and will still enjoy the game.<br />
<br />
And yes, you're completely right. Players will be geared more for raids and dungeons, but I just don't understand why they're making it almost a necessity to have one. &quot;Later raid tiers will be tuned around most players having a legendary item.&quot; That's all I was getting at. I miss the idea of a legendary item actually being legendary. But, that changed actually around Burning Crusade. I just keep forgetting that it's actually been getting easier since Vanilla to get one. Change happens. Lets see how long it takes me to get my first one this expansion lol. My luck, it'll be towards the end of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You realize that legendaries stopped being rewards of exceptional skill after Vanillar right? The two legendaries in TBC were rare drops. The Two legendaries in Wrath were only available to a select few classes and just required a grind for the most part. So honestly....legendaries have been easy to get since TBC. Not sure why people are crying about how now they're world drops and such now. That's what they were in TBC. Also, they don't drop from just ANY mob. If you actually read patch notes and such, you would see they only drop from dungeon bosses, raid bosses, and world bosses. You're not gonna find a legendary off a random add in the world.</div></div><hr />

This confused me too. Anybody now why this mount was mentioned? Better not be getting the rep removed. I worked hard on that. It's always the things I do that get simplified.</div></div><hr />

About every &quot;get ready for legion&quot; video and article i have seen mentioned getting the water strider or water walking potions. I have not heard that the rep gate is being removed, but on at least two articles/videos they mentioned getting the rep done, if you hadn't already.<br />
<br />
I think all that we can take away from this is that there is going to be a lot of water to contend with ...</div></div><hr />

Then you should realize the Kirin Tor rings for WotLK were highway robbery when they were put in. The gold price is deliberately set that high because some people have that gold.</div></div><hr />

even more so if you wanted to upgrade it over the lifetime of the expansion, if they follow the same route this time round of adding a newer version every &quot;tier&quot; then expect the gold cost to be astronomical.</div></div><hr />

They mentioned the water strider, because it can walk on water, which is a good thing when you're leveling, why is this a mystery to people?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Two things.<br />
<br />
1.) Nobody is forcing you to buy these items, they are there as a gold sink.<br />
<br />
2.) If you REALLY want the mount, you can save up for it (2mil seems like a lot, but over the course of the expansion, I'm sure 2 million is achievable.)</div></div><hr />
