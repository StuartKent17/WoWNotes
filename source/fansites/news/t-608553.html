The latest issue of PCGamer in the UK had a WotlK preview article, most of the stuff here was already known but there was also a small Q&amp;A with Tom Chilton (Kalgan) and a very interesting question answered. Thanks to Matt for the info. <br />
PC Gamer: What else is changing?<br />
Tom Chilton (Kalgan) : We’re also going to be doing away with spell-damage only type gear. We’ll be moving to a system that, as part of your talents, will let players convert healing into spell-damage and vice-versa as part of their talents. That way they can use the exact same gear, but their talents just adapt what it does.”<br />

Blizzcast 3 Summary<br />
Oh I know it's already a few days old, but better late than never I guess. Below is a small summary of the 3rd Blizzcast (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=8477.0) for all the people who didn't want to go through the whole interview. <br />
General<br />
PvP armor will be different from the PvE armor entirely in looks and colors this time.<br />
Daily quests will be more widely used in Wrath of the Lich King and should be in place as soon as the expansion ships. More quests will be available with more randomization to make them less repetitive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons<br />
Wrath of the Lich King should have about a dozen of 5-man dungeons available. <br />
The loot will be better in Heroic instances.<br />
The attunement process for both Heroic and raid instances will be improved. <br />
More timed events will be added in WotLK and they will be tuned to let skilled players really show off that little extra emphasis that they put on raiding.<br />
Timed runs won't really feel like a necessity anymore, the plan is to make them more like an additional challenge to the dungeon. <br />
Heroic Badges will be back in WotLK, and the concept will be applied to both Heroic and Raid dungeons. The current plan is to create different Badges for different tiers of gear and just not let players buy all the gear with the same currency. <br />
Some of the Badge rewards might be spread to reputation vendors as well<br />
In Utgarde Keep, the first dungeon players will explore, developpers try to vary up the architecture from room to room so it feels and look a little bit different, different creatures are used in the different rooms. Various crowd control types can be used throughout the instances, so the dragons can be hibernated, there is humanoids, undead for the different crowd control types all have options in the dungeon. There are also some really cool scripted boss fights too. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids<br />
25-man gear quality will be 1 tier higher than the one you can find in the 10-man version of the same dungeon. <br />
10-man and 25-man versions of Armor Sets will use the same models but with different colors or more particle effects for the 25-man version. <br />
The goal is to keep as many raid timers as possible on a 7 day reset. These timers will always match between 10 and 25-man versions. <br />
First raids in WotLK will be a little bit more accessible to people in general. <br />
10/25 man versions of the same instance will have totally separate progression and will be equally hard. The 10-man version isn't supposed to be easier or anything like that.<br />
With CoT: Culling of Stratholme, the developpers are trying to stay as close as possible from the Warcraft 3 storyline without just recreating the mission in the original game. The whole gameplay have to be changed to make it exciting in a MMO. The Infinite Dragonflight storyline will also be continued here. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Naxxramas / Ashbringer<br />
Naxxramas is supposed to be an accessible early tier raid which will actually be pretty easy for both 10 and 25 person groups<br />
The story of Ashbringer will be continued in Wrath of the Lich King<br />
Whether or not Atiesh exists in its current form or a new form is still undecided.<br />
Some encounters like the 4 Horsemen, Gothik, Kel'thuzad, and Gluth will definitely have to be changed slightly to fit the new raid sizes. <br />
The new version will also let developers work again on &quot;flawed&quot; encounters and improves them, The 4 Horsemen is probably the most important one but developpers think they can also do a better job on Loatheb or Grobbulus. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course if you've got enough time, you should read the full version of Blizzcast 3 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=8477.0)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Intie</div><div class="date">2008-06-09, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understand it there will be gear with some &quot;universal spell power&quot; - for example:<br />
<br />
Imba Hat of the Sorcerrer<br />
+45 Stamina<br />
+39 Intelect<br />
+35 Universal Spell Power<br />
<br />
Then mages/locks/ele shamans/etc. will have talent that will convert 1 USP to 2 Spell Damage while holy priest/druids/resto shamans/etc. will have talent in their holy/resto trees that will convert 1 USP to lets say 7 Healing. <br />
<br />
That way when you respec from holy priest to shadow priest, you can still wear the same hat and still get appropriate stats from it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Exactly. For example you'll have a talent that conversts 20% of your bonus healing to spelldamage (so'll get ~50% of your healing convertet to damage alltogether). This means that for example moonkins can wear healing gear without penalties.<br />
<br />
Talents like that were in the leaked alpha trees iirc.</div></div><hr />

What gear is there with just spelldamage? It's always 50/50 damage/healing. <br />
<br />
If it all boils down to one type of spellpower converting to either spelldamage or healing, depending on talents, that's nice for hybrids, but it sucks for the other classes. Even more people to roll against... fighting over a mage needing the spellpower hat for dps or the priest for healing... :-\</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now healers won't be 'pigeon hole'd' into having great healing gear, but average dps gear. No, the 33% spell damage wasn't really enough. Hybrid classes will have an easier time to attain gear for multiple specs now.<br />
<br />
But this thread will be flooded with &quot;waaahhh waaaahhh, more competition for my epics waaahhh waaaahhh&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Theres nothing to prevent the talents that increase healing from also reducing the DPS component. So a talent might increase how healing benefits from spell power by 5/10/15/20/25% while also reducing how it will affect your damage spells by 2/4/6/8/10%. Until we know more there is no point jumping to conclusions.</div></div><hr />

Did you even read what the change is? Through talents you can convert that spell 'power' to damage or healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However I'd personally rather have this done for tanking / dps gear.. I'd say I far prefer gathering dps gear on my healer than I do for my tank, since the tank gear always feels pretty useless for me personally. :)<br />
<br />
Not enough info yet, I'll stay cautiously pessimistic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Wouldn' count on that. Shadow Priests could also be supposed to use the same gear that mages and warlocks use. Cloth with sta, int, spitit spellpower and spellcrit on it (yes, warlocks will use spirit in wotlk).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nebalee</div><div class="date">2008-06-09, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I can't just swap some gear for spelldamage to do daylies or whatever with my resto druid but I need to respecc? ::)</div></div><hr />

Respeccing costs gold, but that's it. People don't have to do grind honor, spend thousands of gold, ... for their healing set.<br />
I don't understand why people call Blizzard lazy? The point of all is that we benefit from it right?<br />
Despite the competition, priests, Elemental and Restoration Shaman, Balance and Restoration Druid will be very happy with this change! And this means there will be more spell damage gear overall.<br />
<br />
Heroic Badges will be back in WotLK, and the concept will be applied to both Heroic and Raid dungeons. The current plan is to create different Badges for different tiers of gear and just not let players buy all the gear with the same currency.<br />
This sounds very good to me. Now people can grind the 'easier' heroics with T5 to get Isle of Quel'danas items.<br />
Now people who do more difficult heroics will be better awarded!<br />
<br />
It's gonna be good :)-</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitzlestick</div><div class="date">2008-06-09, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I can't just swap some gear for spelldamage to do daylies or whatever with my resto druid but I need to respecc? ::)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ideally all gear will have spell damage, any healing tree will include talents to increase healing done by x% from your spell damage. <br />
Ideally that talent will not lower your spell damage in favor of healing, cause if that happends, healers will need to respec to do any damage, while now they can just change gear sets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I only hope blizzard does the same for tank gear... cause healers already got a nice boost with the adding of +dmg on healing gear a few patches ago. Tanks got nothing, again.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bloodwine77</div><div class="date">2008-06-09, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So it's safe to say that warlocks and shadow priests won't be finding any &quot;+x shadow damage&quot; gear in WoTLK. Shame. Unless warlocks and shadow priests get special modifiers to convert to shadow damage.<br />
<br />
Also, I like how they say &quot;10-man raids won't be any easier than 25-man raids, but the 25-man raiders will get a better tier of gear!&quot;. It just sounds like they are having a really hard time trying to wrap their heads around making the game more casual friendly yet still offer challenges to the hardcore.<br />
<br />
While I like the concept of being able to raid everything in 10-man format, it'd be like 10-man raiding Karazhan for months only to then go back and 25-man it. Seriously, by the time you're geared from Karazhan you really don't want to go back and see that place again (that place would be dead now if it weren't a badge farm).</div></div><hr />

<br />
first of all it wouldn't make much sence why change it with how it now works?<br />
<br />
set bonusses? all are getting same bonusses then too?<br />
<br />
WTF would a mage want with gear that says +healing even though his talents change it it would look uber stupid while inspecting some mage or warlock orsomething<br />
<br />
imho it looks damn fecking stupid would mean no more +shadowdmg items either wich often have most spelldmg on them frozen shadowweave boots for example<br />
<br />
@bloodwine77 : what you say about 10man and 25 man raids is crap<br />
10 man raids will be bit easier then 25 mans ofcourse cause there is also said that the gear gap between 10 man and 25man is almost a full tier <br />
<br />
it simply is harder to get 25 man to raid and do their job then it is to do 10 man it takes 15 more people who need to do their job good so for casuals there be 10mans and for hardcore 25 mans</div></div><hr />

I'm just going by what the Blue said above:<br />
10/25 man versions of the same instance will have totally separate progression and will be equally hard. The 10-man version isn't supposed to be easier or anything like that.<br />
<br />
I understand the complexity of coordinating 25 people vs. 10 people, but 25-mans aren't always harder than 10-mans. I personally find ZA more challenging than Gruuls or Mags. The flipside to 10-mans is there is generally less room for error than 25-mans (unless you outgear the place)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lolatheb</div><div class="date">2008-06-09, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">(About the Spelldmg change....)<br />
<br />
I know that this is World of Rumorcraft, but we shouldn't rush (imo) to judge this change. Let's see first how it's really/finally going to be.<br />
<br />
Btw, do you remember at all this talent (Priest - Shadow) that was initially in Wotlk Alpha?<br />
Growing Pains - &quot;Converts 4/8/12/16/20% of your bonus healing into bonus spell damage. In addition, your Mind Flay has a 20/40/60/80/100% chance to refresh the duration of your Shadow Word: Pain on the target.&quot; (Shadow)<br />
<br />
Ok, it got removed from the game, but I think it shows more or less what they are thinking...<br />
Why did they remove it? I have no idea. Maybe it didn't work exactly as they wanted....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I only hope blizzard does the same for tank gear... cause healers already got a nice boost with the adding of +dmg on healing gear a few patches ago. Tanks got nothing, again.<br />
<br />
<br />
M8, I noticed in the leaked info from Wotlk Alpha, that the threat of all warrior tanking abilities will (AT LAST) scale with AP. Now warrior tanks have minimum AP (afaik) so.... Does it mean we will see some sort of AP in tanking gear? That wont (ofc) come in the penatly of ilvl? I am not sure, just a thought...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ishy</div><div class="date">2008-06-09, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">good thing for hybrids. So fuck the rest of you<br />
<br />
<br />
Not just for hybrids. <br />
If more people share the same gear type, more of that type can drop. <br />
For example :<br />
A boss nows drops mail : spelldmg, healing<br />
Leather : spelldmg, healing<br />
loot list full.<br />
<br />
wotlk:<br />
Mail : spelldmg/healing item<br />
leather: spelldmg/healing item<br />
Cloth:spelldmg/healing item<br />
<br />
Lets say you only have a shammy healer with you.<br />
Pre wotlk:<br />
Darn mail spelldmg loot -&gt; de.<br />

<br />
So gear with alot haste locks and SP might not want. All gear will not be for all class. It will just make some gear work for more then 1 spec. Yes this is most help hybrids, but it will also help soem class itemize better. The gear will provide power and the talents will itemize it for you. This basics makes gear tier like and our class and spec gives us what is useful to for us.<br />
<br />
I hope they do this this melee too. I'm sick of all mail being itemized for hunters and not enhancement shamans. Warriors could even wear the same gear for tanking and DPS. <br />
<br />
The only thing I see that would need to change is gems, but then they could have the same power rating and it would work just the same as gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what Ive seen on a few different forums instead of universal spell power, this new stat will be called &quot;Spell Efficiency&quot;<br />
<br />
In different trees for different classes there will be a talent that allows you to convert this spell efficiency into either healing, or damage. IE: The resto druid talent allows you to convert 1 point of spell efficiency into 3 healing, and the balance talent allows you to convert it into 1 point of spell damage.<br />
<br />
The hold back to this is twofold.<br />
<br />
One: The current ability of a class, say a resto shaman, to put his or her elemental gear and go out to kill things (without respeccing) is now no longer available. In order to change ANY healing into damage, or any spell eff into dmg the character will have to respec and drop 50g.<br />
<br />
The second draw back that has been mentioned before is the itemization on different pieces. It would seem now that if an item is intended as a split between healing and damage, for say a resto druid/boomkin cross, that it would need... <br />
<br />
Healing for resto, mp5 for resto, spirit for resto, and possibly haste for resto.<br />
<br />
Spelldamage for boomkin, spellcrit for boomkin, spellhit for boomkin, and possibly haste for boomkin.<br />
<br />
As you can see there are really only two common stats between the two sets, so spirit / mp5 are largely wasted on a boomkin and spellhit and crit are largely wasted for a resto druid.<br />
<br />
In my opinion there is probably something more than meets the eye to this system, and it might work out, but if all available information is true, we're in for bad news.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Hey I have an idea, why not give every item a value and let's call it the Item Level, then let the players choose what to use the levels for! That way we only need to make one cloth item, one leather item, one mail item and one plate item per slot, and then just let them upgrade it!&quot;<br />
&quot;GOOD IDEA!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah so if the item level is 141, you can put it into 141 stamina if you'd like!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, or block rating!&quot;<br />

Well, hopefully paladins get talent that change healing into spelldamage so healer pally -&gt; tank pally too. That would be good.

<br />
If they itemize better than they do as of right now then it could be potentially great. <br />
<br />
1.) It would finally allow hybrid classes to really be hybrid (assuming they finally give free respecs and find another gold sink, you need gold sinks though) because say a Priest could switch between Shadow and Holy and still do relatively well (Remember damage gear might still have &quot;other&quot; stats such as Spell Crit, Spell Hit, and vice versa like larger amounts of regen stats) for a raid.<br />
<br />
2.) The first thought that came to mind, and its negative, was this just being another way for them to reuse the same models/textures for both healing and damage gear for all classes using that armor type. Do we really want every Priest, Warlock, and Mage of any spec running around with the same shoulders?<br />
<br />
3.) is 2. I really hate the thought of seeing everyone in the exact same gear again.<br />
<br />
4.) is 3 is 2.<br />
<br />
5.) Honestly this just seems like a lazy way of admitting they have no honest clue how to itemize items for their own game. Time after time Blizzard has had no clue what spec would be the most popular for their game in all but a few occasions. This is simply another example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with hybrids (shamans, pallies, druids and to some extend priests and warriors) is that they need to collect several sets of gear to actually use their supposed advantage of being flexible.<br />
Which once you got past a certain point in the itemsation is very hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Effectively this makes hybrids actually less flexible than pure classes. If a mage wants to go from fire to frost he can use pretty much all his old gear (exept some few rare +fire items, but those are the exeption, not the norm). If a shaman wants to switch from ele to enh he has to get a complete new gear set.<br />
<br />
If anything this change should be more complete. Enh shamans, feral druids and retri pallies will still have the pigeonhole into one spec/gear combo problem.</div></div><hr />

Now a tank paladin can swap to his healing set and heal if he isn't needed to tank, that will be even less efficient than it is now.<br />
<br />
And it will be really interesting what the do with the stats that only specific classes want like +hit etc, as you can just stack all those onto specific items like rings and trinkets, because the penalty for high stats on one item will be pretty bad.</div></div><hr />

As a shaman... so many more pieces I could roll on!! What's going to limit elemental and resto shamans to just mail? While typically a shaman will use a non-mail piece if it makes sense gear-wise and we are not jacking someone else's piece.... now it seems like that has been thrown out the window. <br />
<br />

Now warrior tanks have minimum AP (afaik) so.... Does it mean we will see some sort of AP in tanking gear? That wont (ofc) come in the penatly of ilvl? I am not sure, just a thought...<br />
<br />
<br />
All Warriors will be able to generate threat equally in all specs. The same with Paladins, Druids, and Death Knights. All +threat talents are being removed and/or changed. Those bonuses to threat talents are now innate to the class (i.e. Defensive stance is now +145% threat for all Warriors).<br />
<br />
This, combined with the removal of crushing blows from a boss's table, essentially means tanking is now a more open aspect instead of a single pidgeon-holed role. No one can be crushed ( by bosses ) so there's a lot of gear options that opens up. And since they're looking to push homogenization to new levels, expect tanks and DPS warriors to be using almost similar gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This poster nailed the one problem I have with this idea on the head. Notice the quote from Kalgan said &quot;Gear&quot;, so it should actually include everything - even rings and trinkets. No more spellhit for YOU... at least from gear.<br />
<br />
So - either they give gear in WOTLK way more sockets, so you can reach your hitrating cap by stuffing hitrating gems in every slot, or they lower the hitrating cap against bosses to something like 7%, or both. Or they introduce something like Heal Resists so even healers would want to get to the hitcap.</div></div><hr />

Im sure the healers will love the spellhit on dmg gear as well. And if there is no spell hit like said before, well have fun..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trovalor</div><div class="date">2008-06-10, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So if I am understanding this correctly, its basically turning all + healing/fire/frost/etc into spell damage. Now you will be required to spend talent points to get back the bonus for specific spell schools (I forget, I think 20% for the damage schools and 33% for healing). My only question is how many talent points? Unless they roll it into something most people get in that spell tree, it shouldn't be more than 1 imo. <br />
<br />
Reason I say that is while for Mages, who have 3 trees for 3 spell schools, classes like warlocks have 2 (fire/shadow) and 3 trees, which tree gets the talent and which tree pretty much gets screwed? Honestly I'd just go so far as to allow you to change your bonus at will at a trainer (free of charge), you get 1 school that gets a bonus at your choosing. (Healing, Fire, Frost, Nature, Shadow, Arcane, Holy)<br />
<br />
Personally for my mage I like this, for my prot pally I'm split. For mage it means I could have the benefit of high spell damage for all 3 spell schools as well the boost to fire as though I were wearing all + fire damage gear. For my protadin it means my healing set for PvP or when I don't MT is now useless, I'm better off using my solo spell damage set (and taking a hit to my healing), however it possibly means (if they add it) I could turn all my + spell damage gear into + holy gear, something I would rather have as when I'm tanking, my chance to heal myself is usually 0.<br />
<br />
I'm seriously hoping they aren't implementing it as you have Spell Damage, and you talent turns it into +fire or + Healing, but it then only counts as + fire/healing meaning for classes like mages, 1000 spell damage would go from 1000/1000/1000 for arcane/fire/frost to 0/1200/0.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malksure of Llane</div><div class="date">2008-06-10, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok... I have been at work and ranting to my co-worker about this. If I understand this post correctly, THIS IS HORRIBLE. I play a level 70 Druid and I choose to carry two full sets of gear. One for damage and one for healing. This is just fine. The new &quot;Spell Efficiency&quot; &quot;Spell Power&quot; &quot;Universal Spell Power&quot; (or whatever it is being called) is going to screw my and others play style over. I would much rather carry two or more full sets of gear to get the desired effect than to have to go to a trainer to respec. I will explain why.<br />
With having this new power I will have to go to a trainer to respec given the current state of the talent tree system. This means that if I go into a WSG, EoS, AB, or AV specced for Boomkin and find out that we have no healers, I can't just click a couple times on Item Rack and flip to do healing. If the Horde team gets to Van in AV and we need extra heals, I can't help. If I stealth to the north and south bunkers and find myself alone, I want my damage gear on. If there is a rogue there I will want my healing gear on. If another druid is there I can decide what gear to wear based on looking at his/her gear. If I have to respec to do other things, how does this make me a better hybrid class. If I go into WSG and our Flag Carrier keeps getting killed before we get to the base and I am specced Boomkin, I can't help. Same if I am specced healing and we need to kill their flag carrier. This applies to all of the normal PVP BGs.<br />
The same can be said on a more limited basis for PVE playing. If I find myself in a 5 man run that I start healing or damage and we lose one class, I will have to go back to a trainer to respec to be able to heal if we can find a DPS but not a healer. Or I would have to respec to be DPS if we can find a healer but not a DPS (This being the unlikely).<br />
Given I can see how some hardcore PVE players will get all hot for this change because of the better chance at loots. But how great would it really be since only Pally and DKs use spells and plate, only shammy (and the higher) use spells/mail, Druids (and highers) for leather, and everyone really can use cloth. <br />
I get that Blizzard is trying to make things more Casual friendly. I am a casual player and I think this idea SUCKS. Having the 2 sets is good to be able to switch at a moments notice. As a PVP player that occasionally gets dragged into PVE by guildies and friends, I think this idea will hurt players like me the most. I don't rely on drops to get my gear for the most part. I think the &quot;Tier Trinkets&quot; to buy the gear you want is the way to go. This is worse than when they put PVP gear for Moonkins back to only Leather items and I can't get the cloth with spell crit like the Veterans boot, belt, and wrist.<br />
The only way I can see this turning out to be a good thing is if the Talent tree becomes more user friendly in that the respeccing becomes not only free but easy to change from one spec to another when ever you are OOC by the click of a button.<br />
By in large I think this may be the straw that breaks my camals back. I just thank god that Starcraft 2 will be coming out so that I have something to play after WotLK turns WoW to CRAP!<br />
Thanks Blizz, I will wait sadly for you to change one more thing from working to broke as &amp;#38;#(#$!</div></div><hr />

Then in order to not have people 'waste' talent points as hinted in other posts current existing talents that say &quot;increases healing done by 5%/10%/15%/20%&quot; for example would change to be &quot;increases +healing gained from generic spell power by 10%/15%/20%/25%&quot; (values increased to take into account the lower value of generic spell power to the usual +healing). This way healers still retain the extra spell damage and casters still have the +healing like we do now and talent points wouldn't be 'wasted'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the way, I usually go instances with a shaman healer, so I have not to be afraid of clothie healers who think they can blackmail me with refusing to heal if I roll on the same loot which is as useful for me as for them. (Personally, I hate healers acting this way. It's my sheep, my frost-nova, my counterspell and my damage which saves their ass if the tank is too lazy, too overstrained or too distracted.)<br />
<br />
I just wonder what will happen to mp/5, +spellhit, +spellcrit and such. Or what about spirit? Will any caster class use these stats as well as any other? Will there be more gem slots, so you can customize these stats? <br />
<br />
Personally, I'd rather carry 2 (or more, as in case of a druid which I played some times ago) item sets and change depending on situation, staying with my favored spec (resto, in that case), then have to be forced to respec for each instance or BG or such. As long as you have to go to a trainer to respec and don't have the possibility to &quot;save&quot; favored specs, this will be annoying at best.<br />
<br />
Or maybe it's Blizzard's plan to force players to &quot;waste&quot; some points in new, crucial talents? (I remember the old days very well, when mages had to spec some points in arcane to get the instant AE and such.) Being railroaded already concerning the efficiency in PvE/Raid/PvP specs this seems not very appealing to me.<br />
<br />
I don't know what to think about it. In this early stage there ist too much room for speculation. I hope, the developers have the possibility and will listen to feedback from the community.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting point, but does your guild really get you to off heal when you're not specced for it?<br />
<br />
For us, never without a respec. For example, we've often had our elemental shammy respec healer and put on healing gear for Gurtogg, where extra healing is needed. Then he respecs back to DPS.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RealPjotr</div><div class="date">2008-06-10, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This poster nailed the one problem I have with this idea on the head. Notice the quote from Kalgan said &quot;Gear&quot;, so it should actually include everything - even rings and trinkets. No more spellhit for YOU... at least from gear.<br />
<br />
So - either they give gear in WOTLK way more sockets, so you can reach your hitrating cap by stuffing hitrating gems in every slot, or they lower the hitrating cap against bosses to something like 7%, or both. Or they introduce something like Heal Resists so even healers would want to get to the hitcap.<br />
<br />
Or they make two different items, one with +hit and less other stats and one without +hit and more other stats. Just like today, why would this change? Those who need +hit simply get the +hit items.<br />
<br />
As a warlock I carry two sets of gear. For some slots I have 2 items with me, one with +hit and less other stats, one with higher damage, but lacking hit. One is used on trash, the other on bosses.</div></div><hr />

Let say you have base 500 of that new &quot;spell power&quot;. If you put talents in spell damage you will have 900 spell damage and 900 healing. If you put talents in healing you will have 1500 healing / 500 spell damage. Seems logical to me. If blizz dont do it like that some ppl will get pretty frustated ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every piece of news get worse and worse. Look.<br />
<br />
1. Healers and Hybrid classes not being able to quickly change gear to suit a situation like throwing on dps gear for enemy player or quickly having to toss out heals like Malksure said.<br />
<br />
2. Having to respec constantly daily to dailies and instance runs instead of just changing gear.<br />
<br />
3. EVERYONE RUNNING AROUND WEARING THE SAME EXACT LOOKING GEAR.<br />
<br />
Could you be more lazy Blizzard. Yeah lets have all raids be the same you just bring different amounts of people to them. Yeah lets have all gear be the same you just change it with talents. Sounds good lets call it a day. <br />
<br />
Brilliant.</div></div><hr />

If warriors will be able to generate threat equally in all specs will the (if there is) a prot tree be more for improving dmg mitigation?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What this means is WotLK gear will have the normal &quot;Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to x&quot;. Healing specs will be able to increase the healing of the item, dps classes, the damage.<br />
<br />
There will no longer be any new gear with &quot;Increases damage done by &lt;magic school&gt; spells and effects by up to x&quot;, but there's no indication if healing &gt; spell damage gear is getting the boot.<br />
<br />
Other changes that I've seen have been spirit becoming important to all caster classes, at least Mages and Warlocks had some indication of spirit based talents. No news on Shaman or Paladins. So this means that at least for cloth gear, mp5 on gear will become a useless stat, given the 2.4 spirit changes, if all casters get the same benefit from spirit regen.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eternalstyle</div><div class="date">2008-06-10, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Breaking it down;<br />
<br />
&quot;We’re also going to be doing away with spell-damage only type gear.&quot;<br />
No more +dmg per spell school gear (ie, shadow, nature, etc...)<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We’ll be moving to a system that, as part of your talents, will let players convert healing into spell-damage and vice-versa as part of their talents. That way they can use the exact same gear, but their talents just adapt what it does.”<br />
<br />
There is no mention of removing +dmg/healing or +healing&gt;dmg stats from gear.<br />
<br />
What is mentioned is 'convert'ing healing into spell-dmg and vice-versa. So let's say you are collecting a sweet +healing&gt;dmg set. You could spec into dps and grab the talents that would convert some of your +healing into dmg. This would change the effect of your +healing&gt;dmg set into the equilivant +dmg/healing.<br />
<br />
In other words<br />
<br />
+10healing,+3dmg stat would become +5dmg/healing with the talent, or vise-versa.<br />
<br />
Now depending on how shitty the placement of that talent in the talent tree, it may or may not be worth getting gear that is not your preferred spec. But, if you had to off-spec for something, you could pick up that talent and still have leet gear to get the job done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look here (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31158)<br />
<br />
In WotLK &quot;wrath&quot; suffixes will be removed.<br />
<br />
&quot;of Healing&quot; will also be removed aka changed into &quot;spell power&quot; (or whatever that will be).<br />
<br />
&quot;of the Invoker&quot;, &quot;of the Physician&quot;, &quot;of the Prophet&quot; and &quot;of the Sorcerer&quot; will be reworked to include &quot;spell power&quot;. (Well actually one of the sufixes will be deleted as there would be no need to have two of them)<br />
<br />
Blizzard will probably add &quot;spell hit rating&quot; on the &quot;removed spell damage &amp; healing gear&quot; sufix .<br />
<br />
And most notably (I am guessing here) both primary attributes (or only one) Intellect and Spirit will both raise &quot;this&quot; suggested universal spell power. <br />
<br />
So no, no one will get shafted (or look exactly the same) unless Blizz would practically completely remodel entire itemization generation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Nothing mentioned indicates that 3:1 healing gear is going to be changed or removed.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SP33D14</div><div class="date">2008-06-11, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understand it there will be gear with some &quot;universal spell power&quot; - for example:<br />
<br />
Imba Hat of the Sorcerrer<br />
+45 Stamina<br />
+39 Intelect<br />
+35 Universal Spell Power<br />
<br />
Then mages/locks/ele shamans/etc. will have talent that will convert 1 USP to 2 Spell Damage while holy priest/druids/resto shamans/etc. will have talent in their holy/resto trees that will convert 1 USP to lets say 7 Healing. <br />
That way when you respec from holy priest to shadow priest, you can still wear the same hat and still get appropriate stats from it.<br />
<br />
This seems quite right I think.. But they will probably have one special talent to set in the trees according to your spec.. So if you'd go healing you'd place your super special imbah talent into the tree at some special super imbah talent spot, And I'm confident they'll fix the MP5, Spirit and spell crit, hit and such the same way.. Like +35 Universal Imbahness Spell change pewpewsomething into Crit rating when you spec fire.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geboran</div><div class="date">2008-06-11, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't imagine that they would &quot;do away&quot; with having FULL healing also be 1/3 spell damage as well for the healing classes.<br />
<br />
What they SHOULD do is keep this mechanic exactly the same, but ALLOW for you to respec for a talent that would give a BONUS to damage/healing on top of this. That way the gear scales the same way, but becomes more POTENT with a proper spec to release its full power.<br />
<br />
Or... set up a toggle so that the PLAYER can choose which stat they want to &quot;boost&quot; with it (sort of like changing an aura) that allows you to convert the points to: healing, spell damage, attack power, or defense.</div></div><hr />

looks like it's called &quot;spell power&quot; and it's the same amount as spelldmg now (1 spell power = 1 spell damage)<br />
