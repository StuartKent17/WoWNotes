PTR 3.0.8 Official patch notes updated<br />
Wryxian posted slightly updated patch notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/7190770922-ptr-patch-308-notes.html) on the european forums. A lot of these changes have been mentionned in past blue posts, but I'm pretty sure that Polearms now trainable by Druids and Mental Quickness swapped with Static Shock are new changes. <br />

Arcane Shot: Mana cost lowered to match the cost of Steady Shot.<br />
Explosive Shot: Damage increased substantially, and additional scaling added to compensate Survival Hunters for the decrease in power of Steady Shot. No longer deals damage to secondary targets.<br />

Healing and mana management &quot;too easy&quot; for the moment<br />
Mana management for healers in particular, and in large raids in particular, does seem to be really easy. This is interesting because so many players in beta had the feedback that they were having mana difficulties.<br />
<br />
You can point at several mechanics that might make mana regen too easy: replenishment, int benefiting spirit regen, spirit offering so many other benefits, the content being relatively easy right now....<br />
<br />
We aren't making any changes to how things work for the moment, but it is something we're keeping an eye on. Just keep in mind that when encounters can't challenge healer mana pools, they end up having complex mechanics to learn, or dump huge damage spikes on the tanks in order to be of sufficient difficulty.<br />
<br />
Ulduar will also be harder than Naxx. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13393405264-have-blizzard-failed-the-mana-regen-game.html))<br />

Arena balancing and Season 5 launch<br />
Look, this is the first major change WoW has seen since Arenas launched. At the beginning of BC nobody was quite sure what to expect. Classes and gear and even the Arena rules evolved since that time, but we still have seen nothing on the scale of the class and gear changes that occured when Lich King went live. We've done our estimates and players have made many predictions and we are all going to know a lot more about the true state of things in a few weeks here. Sure, I'm nervous. The forums and perhaps even the actual game are going to be pretty crazy for a few days. If the past is any indication, there will be at least one or two huge issues that nobody predicted while some of the things we were all worried about will end up being not that big a deal. But you have my word that we will keep making adjustments until things feel fair. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13587298894-gc-what-is-plan-b.html))<br />
<br />
Healing and resilience effect on game balancing<br />
Dynamics shift dramatically as players acquire more resilience gear. Specs and comps that aren't viable in straight PvE gear become much more viable when burst damage decreases. We have seen this happen for four seasons now.<br />
<br />
We haven't made an effort to keep the dynamic from shifting, nor do we think it's a problem that the dynamic shifts. On the contrary, if you didn't notice any effect from all that gladiator gear you were acquiring, it would be much less motivational as a reward.<br />
<br />
Likewise, if you could heal through tons of damage even without a lot of PvP gear, then what would happen with lots of PvP gear? It's likely the game would devolve into silencing or CC'ing the healer and specs that rely on doing a lot of damage would be shut out as gear improved.<br />
<br />
As I have said in a few threads, most players agree that the strength of healing increases as the burst damage endemic to crits decreases. The only question is to what degree. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13587719113-ive-never-seen-something-move-obvious-since.html))<br />
<br />
Patch notes bug fixes list<br />
The patch notes tend to focus more on design changes. It lists some bugs, but there are a lot more bugs fixed than make the list. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13392255348-please-tell-me-that-bug-list-isnt-everything.html))<br />
<br />
Guild structure and raid composition<br />
My perception is that guild structure has more variety than many players suspect.<br />
<br />
What I mean is that there are very small guilds who focus on 10-player content, but every player is there for every attempt. There are also huge guilds with hundreds of players that can run 2-3 separate 25-player runs. Many guilds have core raiders and then a lot of other people who are content to level or do heroics and maybe fill in for the raid once in awhile. There are guilds that struggle to ever get Resto druids and guilds that have rogues and paladins coming out their ears. Many guilds have long-term players who have changed their main character and maybe even the role they fill multiple times. Many guilds collapse and new, often smaller and sometimes better guilds rise from their ashes.<br />
<br />
We do make changes to try to acknowledge the diversity of guilds. Allowing for a complete 10-player progression path was one of them. Giving groups more ways to get the most powerful buffs was another.<br />
<br />
The buff / debuff overhaul was a pretty big undertaking. While we are happy with the core design, we do feel there are specs that could offer a little more and that is the kind of thing we will improve over time. We definitely don't want to get back in the realm though where a spec has such a crazy powerful ability that they are considered mandatory for a raid to succeed. <br />
<br />
[...] Are Innervate, Rebirth and Bloodlust great abilities? Absolutely. Am I happy when I get one in my raid? Yes. Do I sit out the warlock, rogue or mage in order to stack Rebirth? Not really. A good raid is one in which Rebirth gets used zero times.<br />
<br />
Players also have a tendency to gloss over that &quot;all other things being equal&quot; part. Very few guilds can make the assumption that everyone in the raid has equal skill and gear, and honestly those guilds don't have invite drama. They know exactly who is coming and why ahead of time.<br />
<br />
Should you take a great shaman with Bloodlust over a cruddy rogue? Probably.<br />
<br />
Should you take a cruddy shaman with Bloodlust over a great rogue, assuming Bloodlust will make up the dps differnce? Probably a bad move.<br />
<br />
Are your shaman and rogue consistently within 5% dps of each other to where the only tie goes to Bloodlust? If so, I would argue you are in some theoretical space and not in the actual game. If your guild is this good then the real answer is it probably doesn't matter and you are going to resolve the invite with a /random or DKP or who is best friends with the GM or something.

Feedbacks on threat issues<br />
We could definitely use some more feedback on this. We aren't seeing many threat issues on death knights overall, but that's why I am asking for more input. It could be that DKs are really gimping themelseves threat-wise in order to reach the defense cap.<br />
<br />
It is also interesting that DKs would complain about their initial burst threat, since there are several posts in this forum from druids arguing that their initial burst threat is the weakest among the tanks.

Swipe threat increase<br />
We think we might try increasing threat by 50% because that is something easy to hotfix. That should buy you enough globals to do other things, and provide enough wiggle room if you get a target out of the area for one Swipe. We'll consider additional changes after we've had a chance to see how that plays out. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/13392294985-ghostcrawler-swipe-is-not-fun.html))<br />
<br />
Swipe (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/13392294985-ghostcrawler-swipe-is-not-fun.html))<br />
I haven't commented on Swipe in some time because a lot of different arguments tend to get mashed together. That in turn makes it hard for us to detect if the ability actually isn't doing its job, or if [some] druids just want it to work differently, or if [some] druids want more different kinds of buttons to push.<br />
<br />
Here are the arguments I typically see, roughly ranked in what I think is most to least important.<br />
<br />
Swipe doesn't generate enough sustained threat.<br />
Swipe doesn't generate enough burst threat.<br />
Swipe's angle and target requirement make it hard to use.<br />
Swipe is okay, but you want other abilities to throw in there with it (and without giving Swipe a cooldown). <br />
<br />
[...] Part of my point was that many of you are posting something to the effect of &quot;All druids agree that the main problem is X,&quot; when even within a few posts you see wildly different opinions.<br />
<br />
We aren't going to turn Swipe into Thunder Clap, and I don't think many of you are asking for that (though a few are).<br />
<br />
The problem is if we changed the cone or if we changed the threat or if we added another ability, then a large portion of this thread at least would respond &quot;But you didn't fix the problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
So the kinds of discussions we are having are what changes to make to Swipe (if any) that will solve some of these problems without turning Swipe into Thunder Clap. <br />
<br />
[...] Right, but imagine we increased the threat generated by swipe by 400% (just for the sake of argument). Now it is possible to say:<br />
<br />
Swipe generates so much threat that I can use Mangle, Maul, Lacerate, Bash, Feral Charge or Demo Roar without worrying about losing aggro.<br />
<br />
I can spam Swipe, but why? After a hit or two I have more than enough threat. I can afford to save it even.<br />
<br />
If the threat was high enough, it could have a cooldown to enforce not spamming it. (We'd be very reluctant to do this though.)<br />
<br />
Swipe has a positional requirement which requires a little more planning or skill to use than Consecrate, but in return it generates a lot more threat.<br />
<br />
My point above was that we are not going to make everybody happy, so you will probably find yourselves less disappointed if you don't get tied to the One True change that will fix Swipe for you.<br />
<br />
It is very easy to look over at another character and think &quot;Man, if I just had that ability, I could do my job so much better.&quot; That's a good thing. It means that other classes' abilities are so cool or useful that you want them. But for the same reason we are hesitant to give them to you because then the ability is less special and the classes all end up feeling really similar. If you ever switch from druid to warrior or paladin or DK, we want you to have to relearn the class. Make sense?<br />
<br />
We want druids to be great AE tanks, and it may be that you aren't quite there yet. But we will almost certainly do it without removing the positional requirement AND adding a lot of threat to Swipe. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/hunter.jpg Hunter (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=620) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br />
Hunter melee boost?<br />
Hunters are fundamentally a ranged class. I don't think many people are arguing against that.<br />
<br />
The melee issue came up as a potential answer to what you do when someone closes on you?<br />
<br />
Plate-wearers can often stand there and take it.<br />
Rogues can pop Evasion, or stun and run.<br />
Mages can Blink... and so on.<br />
<br />
Maybe it makes sense that hunters, as mail-wearers with some melee specials, should be a little closer to the top of that list than the bottom. We're not saying a hunter should take out a death knight at point-blank range. But maybe if the DK is wounded or the hunter has good healing that you should think twice about always running up on the hunter. <br />
<br />
[...] Some of you guys make it sound as if every decision in an Arena is pre-determined. If you fight a hunter you will ALWAYS run up to melee with the hunter. If all of the decisions were that easy, we would all be walking around with Gladiator titles.<br />
<br />
Rather, what really happens is that you make a lot of decisions on the fly. You process a lot of information quickly, and those of us who can make the right decision very, very fast tend to do really well in PvP. Maybe I can burst that guy down while he's on cooldown. Maybe we need to switch targets right now. Maybe we need to buy some time until my ability has finished its cooldown.<br />
<br />
Arenas are fundamentally not duels simply because there are teams involved, and that makes a world of difference.<br />
<br />
I can totally imagine a situation where &quot;run up on the hunter&quot; makes sense somtimes (perhaps the hunter has no healer nearby and I'm at full health and his Disengage is on cooldown) and not at other times (perhaps I am very wounded so I know that a Raptor Strike could actually do me bodily harm instead of being something missing from many hunter bars). Nobody is suggesting &quot;Hey, what if hunters could also be rogues?&quot; least of all the hunters.

Judgement bug fixed<br />
Okay, we think we have been able to isolate this bug and put in a fix that prevents Judgements from failing any longer. Assuming a little more testing supports this conclusion we plan on hotfixing this.<br />
<br />
Sorry you had to endure it for so long. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13393781481--gc-how-to-reproduce-the-judgment-bug.html))<br />
<br />
Loken with a Holy Paladin healer<br />
Here is a strategy I have seen used a lot on heroic Loken with a paladin healing.<br />
<br />
Everyone moves to melee together. The paladin casts Beacon on himself.<br />
When you get the emote for Lightning Nova, everyone moves back together.<br />
There is often a misperception that Lightning Nova has a huge range. It doesn't. You don't have to move far.<br />
You also don't need to run back to Loken. Let him come to you. Then next Lightning Nova, move backwards again. You can do a slow kite all the way around the globe if you need to.<br />
Of Loken's three abilities, Lightning Nova is the worst, followed by Pulsing Shockwave. Arc Lightning can do a lot of damage, but it's not always worth spreading out to try and avoid it because then the other two abilities can nail you. However, if you are getting multiple stacks of Arc Lightning, the damage can add up. If it gets to be a problem, try to spread out slightly but still move together as a group.<br />
This isn't a healing fight at the end of the day. It's a movement and coordination fight, much like Murmur in Shadow Labs.<br />
<br />
Loken does kill more players than any other boss. He's not a pushover. Good luck! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13129158565--healing-halls-of-lightning-as-holy-paladin.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/rogue.jpg Rogue (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=630) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?rogue))<br />
Rogue DPS and Honor Among Thieves<br />
Rogues should be doing very high dps if not the highest dps for some fights. If that isn't happening we will buff them (ideally in a way that does not inflate their PvP damage potential).<br />
<br />
There is a known bug with Honor Among Thieves where multiple rogues with the ability in one group generate too many combo points. It isn't our intent that this bug make up any PvE dps deficiency.<br />
<br />
A similar bug was mentioned months ago where only one rogue in a group would receive combo points frequently if other people in the group received a lot of crits. This is working as intended as far as we can tell. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13275621477-nerf-or-fix-rogue-hat-spec.html))</div></div><hr />

Do your 10 games per week i suppose...On a related note, it seems like a huge cop out by Blizz to say &quot;well if healers are viable in teams now in pve gear, they'll be OP in pvp gear&quot; Want a simple solution? Put substantially less spell power on pvp gear so they heal for alot less. They said the arena will devolve into silencing/CCing the healer and high DPS wont have a place in it. Were they not here for the first 4 seasons? Isnt that exactly what it was except for the fact that you need high DPS to kill the healer while they are unable to heal? Its a joke that their solution to the high DPS/lack of resil problem in arenas, a portion of WoW that they want to market as an e-sport, is &quot;healers spec into your DPS tree or lose 10 games a week for blue gear.&quot; While getting that blue gear, you can think about how the better DPS classes are collecting their higher quality purple gear, creating a situation where you are still at a disadvantage.</div></div><hr />

Rogues should be doing very high dps if not the highest dps for some fights. If that isn't happening we will buff them (ideally in a way that does not inflate their PvP damage potential).<br />
<br />
There is a known bug with Honor Among Thieves where multiple rogues with the ability in one group generate too many combo points. It isn't our intent that this bug make up any PvE dps deficiency.<br />
<br />
A similar bug was mentioned months ago where only one rogue in a group would receive combo points frequently if other people in the group received a lot of crits. This is working as intended as far as we can tell. (Source)<br />
<br />
A fix, not a nerf.<br />
Still, it's strange that such a spec outperforms mutilate and combat by such a margin.</div></div><hr />

I completely second your statement. It is really rediculous. What they said is really akin to &quot;if you're a healer just lose your 10 games per week and you will get gear at the end&quot;. The problem then is that dps gets gear faster so they still outgear us.<br />

Savage Gladiator<br />
Rare items, ilvl 200. You can buy them for honor points and they do not require any Arena point or rating. According to what we saw in the last builds of the WotLK Beta the price will be considerably higher than the current honor gear, you can expect to pay up to 60,000 Honor Points for an armor part.<br />
<br />
Why is everybody whining about needing to do arenas to get the blue gear?<br />
<br />

No. Why in the world would they make level 70 gear into level 80 gear? To start arenas off completely imbalanced?<br />

I don't know if they're gone, I'm pretty sure you can still buy them on your level 70 char w/ existing arena points but as soon as you hit 71, they're gone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why does Blizzard keep telling us that Ulduar will be harder than Nxxramas?<br />
Of course it will be harder, no one is expecting another lame instance like Naxx.<br />
<br />
The point is, that Ulduar isn't in the game yet, and probably won't be for a few<br />
more months to come. So many people don't have anything to do because<br />
they already finished all the current raid content. That's the real problem. <br />

<br />
I'm cutting Blizzard slack on adjusting characters as more and more raid at level 80. They probably want to put all these changes into effect before Uldaur is released. There is a difference between content itself being easy, and classes having abilities that trivialize the effort in their roles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have cleared all the game content ( I know that's not much to brag about) and I would say that 3 drakes is definitely content. The difference between Sartharion alone and even one drake is mindless dps spam to paying some attention but with 3 we're actually talking about a challenging fight where you need forthought and planning. Add to that he drops new gear that can't be achieved any other way.<br />
<br />
<br />
With that being said, I'm slightly saddened that after 1 week of 25 man raiding for my guild, we having nothing new to do but clear everything for loot and practice a harder way of fighting a boss.</div></div><hr />

And still no hit rating mail gear. It seems blizz just gives a shit about ele shammyes, they just wanna stop ppl complaining.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree and disagree. Blizz has posted several times they are planning on changing the way elementals scale. The new LB glyph will also help. Shamanism will also help. I think it's a good beginning, and all of these do scale. Is it enough? Hopefully.<br />
<br />
But the thing about +hit, you're completely off base. All tier gear, regardless of class (at least that I've looked at) has only 2 pieces with +hit. Every class has to hit the same magic number and we all have to plan for it and gem for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is not entirely true. :o<br />
<br />
The Blue Savage PvP Set has two different costs depending on where you get it from.<br />
<br />
in Orgrimmar (sold by: Blood Guard Zar'shi) it has:<br />
<br />
No Team or Personal Rating Requirement<br />
No Arena Point Cost<br />
is Sold for Honor Points<br />
<br />
The same set:<br />
<br />
in Dalaran (sold by: Zom Bacom)<br />
No Team or Personal Rating Requirement<br />
has an Arena Point Cost<br />
has a reduced honor point cost.<br />
<br />
It seems that blizzard is allowing us a cheaper way to get the Blue set given that you spend some arena points.</div></div><hr />

Maybe there is something I'm not grasping about the ladder, but as far as I can tell there needs to be some kind of reward for participation even for bad players, else there won't be any of them around to make you look so good. Maybe thats great if you are the greatest PvPer in your battlegroup, but you probably aren't. I'm not sure if I'll bother with the arena, or just go with crafted pvp gear and 10-man Archavon, so that I can fend of gankers. Since I know I'm not going to qualify for the top gear, the reward for the effort really doesn't excite me at all.</div></div><hr />

All tier gear, regardless of class (at least that I've looked at) has only 2 pieces with +hit. Every class has to hit the same magic number and we all have to plan for it and gem for it. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think what he was trying to get at is that, unlike the other armor classes, there is no off set mail pieces with spell power and hit on them. The only available lvl 200+ mail armor with hit and spell power on them are the couple pieces of T7 gear and some lolPvP gear. Leaving Elemental shaman to either gem for retarded amounts of +hit, carry around a blue +hit trinket, or go searching for cloth/leather caster gear with +hit but no spirit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In this way, you bg only lovers can either do tons of honor farming, or you can still farm the honor but also lose 10 games a week and cut your farming time drastically.<br />
<br />
<br />
What you seem to say is that the honor cost is a lot per piece if you don't dont have any arena points but a lot less if you combine arena points with honor points? In other words, the gear is obtainable without arenas but to a higher honor cost?</div></div><hr />

you have to have a high rating to even GET resilience in 3 of your slots?<br />

After having had enough problems on Loken with decent Shaman healers (and I'm not talking about over-geared people), there's no way I'm setting foot inside Halls of Lightning with a Paladin healer.<br />
While it certainly is doable, it's not worth the trouble or repair bills.<br />
<br />
It seems like when it comes to the other healers it's &quot;we want you to have the tools, but still be a challenge, and it's ridiculous looking at healing meters&quot; while for Paladins the communication goes &quot;you're awesome single target healers, just look at the healing meters, we don't think you need a full tool set&quot;.<br />

That's fine. IFF they remove encounters needing AOE heals from 5-mans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So true. Not only do the sets look terribad, the blue set is not even better than the crafted pvp set. Arenas is also now more fail than they have ever been with class balance at an allt time low, even with WoW standards. Some classes are more or less locked out from any serious PvP.<br />
<br />
Add to that thay you can PvE your way to the best gear without having to do any PvP whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Hell, even the PvE players are unhappy. I mean if people can start farming heroics and naxx as soon as they ding 80 and wear greens and blues something is wrong. No wonder people are bored already when the game has become that easy.<br />
<br />
Compare this to TBC, no way people could farm heroics as freshly dinged 70s.<br />
<br />
When it comes to PvP I miss S1-S2 alot already when you could queue up for som arena matches, have fun with your friends and then do some BGs for fun and som descent gear. BGs now are more or less dead.<br />
<br />
So sad really, becasue Northrend is amazingly well designed with a lot of nice quests and content. The expansion has so much potential and is tons better than outland ever was. They really need to get their act together.<br />

<br />
There is WEAPONS for TIER5! the blue post on the first post CLEARLY say that, S5 tier 3 , 25man quality PvP HAVE WEAPONS!!<br />
<br />
THe gear is ugly, its the first season you cant look like damn Starshiptrooper in one week in arena start, that would destroy the game!<br />
<br />
an the game is more hack and slash than ever so go back to playin sims if you want to make your caracter look like a fag !<br />
<br />
<br />
What a well written and well thought out post! Clearly the gear looks ugly because it takes longer to obtain than previous seasons. It's also obvious that wanting good looking gear makes you a homosexual.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-01-06, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it was neglected that all things being equal the druid, shaman, hunter, and ret paladin, and shadow priest are probably going to get priority over the mage and rogue. The warlock even gets priority over the mage and rogue. Once you buy your own food, the mage offers very little to the raid. However, heroism/bloodlust can make the difference between a wipe and an non-wipe. So can a battle res. So can replenishment. So can full damage buffs to the entire raid which hunters offer.<br />
<br />
I also find it condescending that &quot;a good raid is one where battle res never needs used.&quot; Blizzard tends to forget that this is a MMORPG, and they throw in all these special tricks that are prone to kill players that have a second of lag or a moment of delay in reaction time. Those times require a battle res, but that doesn't mean the raid suddenly went bad. A good raid is one where you pown every boss on the first attempt in my opinion (regardless of what tricks you need to use to get it done).</div></div><hr />

<br />
And anyone crying about DK tank threat is a bad tank. Druid tanks are almost non-existant now, Wotlk nerfed them into a ridiculously useless position. I feel bad, because some of the best tanks I ever knew were really intelligent druids. <br />
<br />
<br />
The really intelligent druids ARE STILL TANKING. Druids were never nerfed into non-existence. They have better over all mitigation than any other tanking class. They lack in avoidance, but when you start looking at them still reaching the armor cap once getting the correct gear and having well over 40,000 hp you can't argue that they just plain suck now. They also have more avoidance than ever before and can normally get up to 40% dodge or higher. After all that, any damage they do take is reduced by 12% through talents. They are actually in a much better place now then they were in TBC. The problem is that the best gear for druid tanks hasn't actually been release yet because, yet again, its all about pvp to gear your pve druid tank.</div></div><hr />
