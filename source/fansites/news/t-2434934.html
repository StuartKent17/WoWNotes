Azerite - Worst Itemization in WoW's History<br />
Holy hell this thread went places. Okay, couple quick things:<br />
<br />
1) I've mentioned elsewhere that we're looking at Azerite armor availability. 3 weeks into a raid tier/mythic+ season is a bit early to make hard conclusions of how difficult it will be to acquire alternate sets over the next few months. But we're hearing that feedback and keeping a close eye on it. Availability in mythic+ particularly is a regular topic of conversation. I've talked about that before so I won't rehash everything here, but we're looking into it.<br />
<br />
2) I noticed a few posts that seemed to believe that Azerite traits are randomized when a piece drops. They're not; each piece of gear has a preset assortment of traits to choose from. Most of y'all seem to understand that already, I just wanted to toss it out there for anyone who may not. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769060102?page=26#502))<br />
<br />
If I wanted to play brewmaster or mistweaver right now, I would be significantly better off by making a 2nd monk. Is this really the design you were going for?<br />
Not at all, and I'm curious why you feel that's the case. It isn't in my experience as someone who is currently playing a tri-spec monk. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769060102?page=27#526))<br />
<br />
Weird, I wanted Uplifted Spirits, Font of Life, and Overflowing Mist on my gear for healing, but instead I have Elusive Footwork, Fit to Burst, and Boiling Brew. As you know, those three do absolutely nothing for mistweaver, while the former three do nothing for brewmaster. It would cost me hundreds to thousands of gold to spec swap even once per day, and since I do m+ as brewmaster and any raiding as almost exclusively mistweaver, that's a pretty frequent occurrence. It would actually save an insane amount of gold to just have a 2nd monk, though I wouldn't do it personally.<br />
<br />
There's also the part where I'd even have equal ilvl azerite pieces pretty quick, since azerite over 340 might as well not exist despite my 370 ilvl.<br />
And you believe the process of leveling and gearing a 2nd monk would be more efficient than farming those 340s on your main?<br />
<br />
To be clear I'm not arguing - legitimately trying to make sure I understand this feedback. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769060102?page=30#582))<br />
<br />
As a quick aside: I understand and appreciate that many of you are frustrated about the system. That's why I'm here - to get a better understanding of what exactly is frustrating people so I can present that feedback to the development team.<br />
<br />
Step 1 of that process is explaining what our viewpoint is so that you guys can present counter-arguments. If your response to that explanation is to roll your eyes and make snarky comments about how dumb I am, that's fine, but it's really not helping make the game any better.<br />
<br />
I get the need to vent, but if y'all could keep the personal attacks and memes to a minimum that'd make it a hell of a lot easier for me to actually help make the video game more fun for you. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769060102?page=41#811))<br />
<br />
Thank you to everyone making the effort to discuss this in a constructive manner. Rest assured that I'm taking all of your feedback to heart. I've got a great list of discussion points and arguments to make on your behalf the next time I meet with the development team.<br />
<br />
There's a number of good points raised in this thread that I haven't responded to yet simply because I haven't had a chance to talk to the devs about them. And, for full transparency, it's going to be a few days before I can. In the meantime, keep making good points and I'll keep taking notes.<br />
<br />
And as for &quot;this conversation should have happened during beta,&quot; you're right. It should have. I'm sorry it didn't. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769060102?page=57#1124))<br />

Teeming Affix and Timewalking Feedback<br />
thank you communication<br />
For bug communication, it sucks.<br />
<br />
When you say that, what exactly do you mean? Is that saying you'd like to know more like for example when issues/bugs get fixed? <br />
<br />
Would be hard to do on individual bug reports but maybe something we could look into on forum posts. If that's what you're asking. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1102099-thank-you-communication/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769366979?page=1#8))<br />
<br />
No feedback on Timewalking issues.<br />
These should be largely fixed now. Anything else you guys still have that isn't working right with it please let us know.<br />
<br />
No feedback on PTR Issues.<br />
There's a couple of PTR things being looked into at the moment. At least with the PTR it's expected to be rough sometimes. If I get more detailed things that I can pass on to you guys I'll be sure to do that. In the mean time I'd keep checking the PTR forums as we update the status of it there.<br />
<br />
The Twitter post isn't even updated daily. Even the Hotfix notes are hidden. No link on the World of Warcraft front page. No updates on the forums. No link in the Launcher.<br />
We always update the same location for hotfixes. https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news It's usually always in the News section. <br />
<br />
As for updating on the Twitter thread with the hotfixes tweets, my personal feel is that it would becomes a little too cluttered if I did it for every hotfix update as it always just links to the same place. If you guys want me to put those in there I will start throwing those in. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1102099-thank-you-communication/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769366979?page=2#22))<br />
<br />
Personally I'd like fixes, or adjustments to be noted. One example is last week teeming Atal'Dazar had an extra pull of 2 colossi on the southern route. However when I did it later in the week that entire pull was removed. Going in I had no idea that that had changed, so it threw my mob % all out of whack.<br />
Yeah I'm not sure why that wasn't noted to be quite honest. We did make some tuning changes with Teeming last week. It was mainly centered around removing some extra packs as some of the density was a little high.<br />
<br />
Hi, I ran end time with my friends last night with discord and can comfortably say without a doubt, it was the worst, badly designed endtime run weâ€™ve ever done. No it is not fixed with the recent hotfixes.<br />
We did some tuning for it a few days ago, and it received another pass again that was applied earlier today. We've now made the following changes to it:<br />
Both Murazond and the Ghouls in the Sylvanas encounter have had their health significantly reduced. We also went through and greatly reduced the damage and health of many creatures and spells as well in End Time.<br />
<br />
It is supposed to be a link to all Twitter communication. Even if the information is in the hotfix notes eventually, the conversations are useful.<br />
Noted! I'll start throwing them in there as well then. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1102099-thank-you-communication/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769366979?page=4#66))<br />

Personal Loot Clarifications<br />
I'm done with shield wearing tanks.<br />
Since it's personal loot, I have to be selected for loot (6 out of 28) on that one specific boss, and then I have to get the specific item out of the boss (1 out of 3) I believe. So my odds of getting a shield are 5%. The odds with master loot, assuming 4 drops instead of 6 would be 36% (11 drop options on the boss so (1/11)+(1/11)+(1/11)+(1/11)). That's where my seemingly &quot;bad luck&quot; is coming from. I am 7 times less likely to get a shield in a raid with personal loot instead of group/master loot.<br />
<br />
To be clear: that is not how personal loot works. Everyone in the raid has their own individual chance to receive loot, regardless of how many people are there.<br />

That way, I'd be &quot;forced&quot; to grind M+ every day to keep up in my mythic raid with the people who have the time for that. They should just up the drop rate for Azerite gear in the weekly chest and add a bad luck protection, so that you're guaranteed a piece after x weeks. Or maybe something like every 4th weekly chest contains an additional piece of Azerite armor.<br />
But please, don't make me grind the armor by adding it in the end chests of M+.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's even more stupid of argument when you look at the guy making it (the monk) and he only has 340 azerite pieces. I could see if he had like 370+ and was bitching a bit, but 340 flows in like crazy, it's become nothing more then DE fodder to me with how many Azerite cache dailies there is.

<br />
So I would say this is a good start that can end up good, but next expansion I think I'll drop paying for this betatesting and come into the expansion when it's actually ready.</div></div><hr />

I DE most of the 340 I get because it's utter trash. But with the exception of my head piece, I'm still reforging the same 2 piece of amour around three specs because none of the others I'm getting are any good. That being said, even if it was viable for another reason to level a second character you're still relying on the same drops, same drop rates and working in the same time frames / lock outs. <br />

He has a point if the point is &quot;not enough 355 or higher azerite drops, i need to level multiple characters for more chances at 355+&quot; but not when he's arguing about 340 pieces. They need to release the restrictions on drop rates of over 340 azerite, it not dropping from M+ directly is my biggest complaint.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The chance of everyone in a 20 man PL raid getting loot is 0.2^20 as a minimum. Bad luck protection increases this chance minimally.<br />
<br />
I think 0.2 was for ML? iirc in legion personal loot would be closer to 0.28 - 0.3*the number of people in raid.</div></div><hr />

If you compare many of the traits, its sub 500dps diff between several of the top tiers.<br />
<br />
More id say, yeah, there is problem, but there is also problems created by the community - That only the best is what they want, everything else is &quot;not intresting&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Too bad content is soft-gated by those who do think this way. What does it matter to me if my dps is suffering by 5%? But it does matter to the pugs and yes, even guild members that I can't reach optimum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have such a shitload of traits you could counter that by making traits zone specific (like they did allready) making the whole point moot anyway. They SHOULD have dropped in mythic +. Specific traits from specific dungeons. And traits should have mattered for specific dungeons, bosses or anything... that would safe part of this shitpile that is azerite...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Proof please?<br />
<br />
Its very likely that he is being honest, but the odds of every single person rolling a piece of gear is, I'm sure, astronomical. Likely will never happen.<br />
<br />
What I would like to know is if getting a piece of gear earlier in a dungeon/raid lowers the chance of getting another piece later, and for each subsequent piece after that, etc.<br />
<br />
Nothing feels worse than getting a piece of loot off the first boss when I only need loot off the last, and getting that sinking feeling in my gut that I'm highly unlikely to get a second piece.<br />
<br />
At the same time, I did once see a guy get 4 pieces of loot from a mythic.</div></div><hr />

Month of farm every shit in game. Thats cool... Considering personal loot I suppose it doesnt works like 5% chance for everyone, cause 5% its 1 of 20. I didnt ever see in 20 man raiding group to drop only 1 item. That means, how I think, that systems works like before, but without players announce. For example we have 20 man raid that means 4-6 items to loot, when we kill boss system starts to randomise how many items we will get from all possible loot, lets say we got 5 items - mail,leather,plate,plate,ring, after starts another roll between all players who can wear that items, and thats how I suppose you recieve loot. And ye your chance stucks after each fail on roll. Every week I got only 1 item per hc raid, thats 1/8 bosses, so individually it looks like 5%. From 6 coins get 0 items. Cant stop laughing how this shit system works, even dont want to go to raid anymore so unlucky feelings. Most things I got is staff that guildies give me, some shit from myth+, some items from weekly chest, but recently no azerite 370 stuff, that sucks. Give me my azerite pcs from chest weekly, why I see people after 3 weeks with 3 different 385 azerite items and I get nothing? Why its not obtainable in myth+ runs? Why its not guaranteed from chest if I cant get it in dungeon runs?</div></div><hr />

I feel like their grasp is so far off like.. the guy is saying he'd have a better chance of gearing both specs having 2 monks because of weekly chests limiting the item slots upgradability and lack of flexibility of azerite. It is a kind of extreme example but I get what hes saying- there is absolutely no good reason we shouldn't be able to freely change Azerite traits. It's like going back to pre-dual spec WoW systems while being stuck in modern bullshit casino lootbox WoW.</div></div><hr />

Yea i'm not huge on farming M+ for azerite armor either. Having it in the weekly chest with BLP would be good though for sure.</div></div><hr />

Even the cost of needing a tome/codex to change talents. It's a lame, antiquated system that has no benefit or purpose for the player. They removed dual spec in favor of allowing you to be any spec you want; it's time to remove this next antiquated system.<br />
But, sadly, having players spend more and more needless gold is nothing but a benefit for Blizzard these days due to the fact they sell tokens. And it seems that they finally realized this with BfA, with how little gold income there is to be had (from WQ/mission sources) compared to WoD and Legion.</div></div><hr />

I am 99.99% sure you can't get more than 5-6 items in a 20m raid...never got more...it's like dungeons, you'd expect personal loot to mean that every boss had a chance to drop an item for each party member, but until the hotfix, each boss would only drop ONE item....how is that personal loot, when your odds are actually matched against the odds of your party members?

They really should have just made the chosen azerite traits spec specific (so they are stored with your specialization). <br />
This would have eleviated a lot of the problems.<br />
<br />
I don't get why they didn't do this, it's the same way our talent trees and previous tier gear worked.</div></div><hr />

Some statistical analysis can show that 4 is the likely expected amount per boss excluding bonus rolls and bad luck protection.<br />

Please. Min-maxing has always been integral to the game for many players. That doesn't mean wearing full BIS, but it does mean being as optimized as you could be - enchantments, gems, reforging, and before that, begin hit capped, et cetera.</div></div><hr />

To be clear I'm not arguing - legitimately trying to make sure I understand this feedback. (Blue Tracker / Official Forums)<br />
<br />
Should be fired immediately... Yes, its easier to gear a second char. I don't know why, but I always get drops on new chars but I haven't seen anything useful (not a single azerite) in the last two weeks *on my main...</div></div><hr />
