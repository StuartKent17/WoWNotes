<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2008-04-22, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While Season 3 is still going strong, we wanted to announce ahead of time the rating requirements that will be present for arena items once Season 4 begins. We also wanted to give everyone a heads up to some changes that will be in an upcoming patch, altering how points are gained and players are matched in the arena system. The patch with these changes is scheduled to release before the start of Season 4.<br />
<br />
First though, the rating requirement changes:<br />
<br />
When Season 4 begins, Season 3 items will be reduced in personal and team arena rating requirement to:<br />
Shoulders: 1950<br />
Weapon: 1800<br />
<br />
The new Season 4 items will have the below personal and team arena rating requirements:<br />
Shoulders: 2200<br />
Weapon: 2050<br />
Head: 1700<br />
Chest: 1600<br />
Legs: 1550<br />
Gloves: none<br />
Off-hand: none<br />
<br />
In addition, some of the Season 4 quality items that will be purchasable with honor will also carry a personal and team arena rating requirement:<br />
Boots: 1700<br />
Ring: 1650<br />
Bracers: 1575<br />
Belt: none<br />
Necklace: none<br />
Trinket: none<br />
<br />
The Season 2 items, which will move to the honor system when Season 4 begins, will continue to have no rating requirement.<br />
<br />
The changes to the rating requirements for these items reflect the nature of the items, their power, and the relative difficulty that should be had when attempting to obtain them. These items are comparable to those found in the newest 25 person raid zone, Sunwell Plateau, and should therefore also feel very challenging to obtain.<br />
<br />
To help ensure that the challenge in obtaining these items stays true to those achieving these ratings, we'll also be implementing new rules with an upcoming patch to curb practices that undermine the core concepts of the arena system. These rules are as follows:<br />
If a character’s personal rating is more than 150 points below the team rating, they will earn points based on their personal rating instead of the team rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This means that a player cannot join a highly rated team and begin earning points based purely on the pre-established rating of the team before they joined it. They'll need to compete, improve, and gain a personal rating worthy of the points they would receive.<br />
If the average personal rating of the players queuing for a game is more than 150 points below the team’s rating, the team will be queued against an opponent matching or similar to the average personal rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This means that players cannot join a highly rated team and immediately face highly rated opponents, easily and quickly bringing their personal rating up. Instead they'll need to again compete, improve, and earn their rating.<br />
<br />
We're excited to see these changes implemented, which will continue to emphasize the strong competitive nature of the arenas, and the challenge in obtaining the highest end rewards available for PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
E.g. There's a shortage of PvP paladins in my guild, so I play on two 5v5 teams each week, because both teams need a paladin and there's only me. I end my games on the higher rated team to get points (one team is around 2150, the other around 1950).<br />
<br />
Under this new system, how will I be able to play with both teams and still get decent points every week? It would seem that my personal rating would quickly lag behind and I'd be out of the 150 point safety window if I kept switching teams.<br />
<br />
I don't want to have to choose between the two teams, since both are comprised of friends, and we can't merge the teams since there's 12 people in total across both (counting me)... Anyone have ideas on what I can do come season 4?</div></div><hr />

I am glad that you will need to be at least slightly skilled to get most of your season 4 gear. And quite honestly, 1700 rating is not at all hard to get, the only hard part will be the weapons and shoulders. The personal rating and queueing changes are a plus too, though I will miss farming points off clueless retards who purchased a 2k team :)</div></div><hr />

This get all the PvP class nerfs out of the PvE game and all the welfare PvP gear off of the toons that do not deserve to have it. There will be ways to cheat the system and get S4 without actually earning it... it will happen, just as it has every arena season so far. Get your PvP out of my PvE and go play CS, GoW, or Halo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's exactly the problem most ppl are ignoring. Current &lt;1500 teams will disappear, and current 1500-1700 teams will take their place, 1900 teams will become 1700 teams, 2k teams will become 1800 teams, etc. Not only will there be significantly less people above 1850 and 2k ratings next season, but those ratings requirements were bumped up 200 pts on top of reducing the playerbase. Getting 2200 for shoulders next season will feel more like getting 2400 rating this season. And getting weapons will feel probably like getting 2200 rating this season.<br />
<br />
I've said it before, I'll say it again, thye need to make ratings dependant on the bracket you play in. They already do it with pts, so why not with ratings too. Make a 2k 5v5 equivalent to 2.1k 3v3 or 2.2k 2v2 rating, and then they wouldnt have to drive up the rating requirements so retardedly high. Those brackets are less balanced and far more saturated (hence more teams in the pool to feed your team rating off of), so they should require higher rating for gear compared to 5v5 that in most battlegroups has 1/5 of the number of 2v2 or 1/4 of the number of 3v3 teams.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather they sorted out some class balance before implementing this.<br />

And uh, these changes hurt people that like to team hop x_x and you'll be seeing a lot more full S3/4 geared people in the lower brackets now.<br />

<br />
I have mixed feelings at best, and my first reation is negative<br />
<br />
#1) I probably have to dump my 2v2 partner that I've played with since Season 1.... Why? Even though we give 120% and have improved tactics, communication, and teamwork during these months, we top out around 1650. (Holy Pally/Ret Pally). That's enough to get some of the pieces but not all. <br />
<br />
Personally I don't feel I should have to break up what has been a fun team because I'm 50 points shy of an arbitrary rating requirement.<br />
<br />
#2) Now I'm bracing for the &quot;You Suck&quot; comments..... Ok now that that's over, let me say that I have enough experience to say while I'm not the best player out there, I do not &quot;suck&quot; at PvP... rather the problem is that in 2v2 the class imbalance is what's causing this problem. Sure, if I join up with a resto druid I'll be just fine... but again that brings me back to point #1<br />
<br />
#3) So many people saying I'm tired of fighting crappy people in full S3 gear.... I dont' see what the problem is. It's not the gear that makes a person good, if they have been &quot;carried&quot; by other people to get an S3 weapon, they may not deserve it, but a sucky player is a sucky player... I've beaten plenty of people with S3 gear, and if you're the one making these comments then your rating is high enough that you've done the same..... what you need to worry about is GOOD people in S3 gear.<br />
<br />
Looking at the arena ladder today, In my battlegroup (Emberstorm) only 50% of the teams have ratings of 1700 or higher. Looking at my server (antonidas) only 25% of the teams have ratings of 1700+..... I don't know how it is on your server, but I definitly speak for the majority of people on mine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is really no different from someone feeling they have to move from a friendly casual guild to a more regimented raiding guild in order to progress in PVE content. It really becomes a question of do you really want those 3/4 extra pieces bad enough to dump your arena buddy...<br />
<br />
I'm in the same kind of situation (I play a feral druid) as I mainly arena with my girlfriend (holy pally). We are not particularly competitive (breaking 1600 is a rarity for us), and will probably keep going well into season 4. However, I'm not willing to switch teams, and will probably just arena less instead.<br />
<br />
I'm sure once we've bought the new gloves/legs (and chest if we're lucky) our participation will drop off a bit as there will be nothing more for us to realistically spend arena points on. Without that carrot, we'll probably spend more time doing other stuff in-game. <br />
<br />
It'll be interesting to see what kind of effect teams like ours dropping out of competition &quot;en masse&quot; will have on the arenas as a whole a month or two into the season...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torian</div><div class="date">2008-04-22, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm overjoyed point selling was nerfed. <br />
<br />
Here's the problem though. Rating selling was buffed. A good team gets to 2200 and brings in a 1500 toon to bring up. They fight groups at 1850 (semi-easy for the 2200's) rather than 2200. 20 wins and the 1500 is now at 1700 which is enough for 3 S4 pieces. If they've saved points from S3 (buy them now while it's easy I guess) and they have 3 pieces easy. Getting much higher would take some REALLY fricking good sellers as they'd be fighting at 2050 with someone who can't make it there themselves.<br />
<br />
You'll still see 1300's as teams start. Tank your score very low on an alt (say 1200), bring in your good toons, start fighting people at 1350 instead of 1500. If you're starting the season why not?<br />
<br />
Requiring a person to maintain their rating to use the gear is the only loophole free solution. How much would that suck?! That, however, makes Arena and the gear belong only to the elite few which seems to be the goal and what most PVE'ers lobby for.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ar10</div><div class="date">2008-04-22, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So with the personal rating change, does that mean you can have a ringer come in to powerlevel your team? For example you team is 1850, and you bring in a totally geared person who will join at 1500. (1850+1850+1500=5200) Then you will fight teams that are on average below 1850 rating correct? (5200/3=1733 rtg) And you can have that ringer leave your team repeatedly so you will never face someone of the same rating. <br />
<br />
Also my take on the changes, I think it will negatively affect the more competitive battlegroups. If you have tons of good teams, it will always be a struggle to move far above and ahead of the pack. Whereas scrub bgs will have the few select teams catapult themselves to greatness.</div></div><hr />

A good team gets to 2200 and brings in a 1500 toon to bring up. They fight groups at 1850 (semi-easy for the 2200's) rather than 2200. 20 wins and the 1500 is now at 1700 which is enough for 3 S4 pieces. If they've saved points from S3 (buy them now while it's easy I guess) and they have 3 pieces easy. Getting much higher would take some REALLY fricking good sellers as they'd be fighting at 2050 with someone who can't make it there themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno, maybe in some weaker battlegroups this would work. But no way in BG9 or BG10 will a 2k team be able to carry a scrub against 1850 teams.</div></div><hr />

As for not seeing low rated players in full s4, you probably will see people buying their way into teams just to get basic pieces. I know I have faced a ton of players in BG-Ruin in full s3 and 1) they were horrible players 2) when checking on armory they didn't have 1 arena team. :|<br />

Yeah, you can buy T5/6 drops on my server for less than what it costs for a week of Arena points. Never mind the fact it takes pretty much 2 weeks to get most S3 gear with points. Only advantage is that Arena matches are quicker done than a BT/MH clear.</div></div><hr />

&quot;To help ensure that the challenge in obtaining these items stays true to those achieving these ratings, we'll also be implementing new rules with an upcoming patch to curb practices that undermine the core concepts of the arena system. These rules are as follows:<br />
<br />
* If a character’s personal rating is more than 150 points below the team rating, they will earn points based on their personal rating instead of the team rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
This means that a player cannot join a highly rated team and begin earning points based purely on the pre-established rating of the team before they joined it. They'll need to compete, improve, and gain a personal rating worthy of the points they would receive.<br />
<br />
* If the average personal rating of the players queuing for a game is more than 150 points below the team’s rating, the team will be queued against an opponent matching or similar to the average personal rating.&quot;<br />

I'm on Ruin as well and the majority of the players you see in full s3 are point sellers. You're always going to see bad players with good gear whether it be PvE or PvP it's just part of the game - but those are the teams that are beatable.</div></div><hr />

Also on the flip, as a new 70 how are you supposed to compete? The pvp blues are a joke, and I'll have to grind my eyeballs out for S2, and waste all my arena pts on S3. So at this rate my lock will never get S4. Lame.</div></div><hr />

A 2200+ player could join a new 2's with a decently equipped druid (hell, probably season 0.5 and a few epics would do the job) and bring that druid up pretty fast. Or in a 3s, I know double DPS equipped players could join a team (doesn't matter if they are a healer or dps) and easily bring the player's rating to at least 1800 (there's an infamous warrior/enhance shaman duo on my server who do this).<br />
<br />
The new 150 point rule should also apply to people with personal ratings 150 greater than the team, take the team average and then decide the match.</div></div><hr />

The bottom end might fall out in this last season but what's the issue there? It's clearly the final season before WOLTK comes out and we'll see serious players going against other similar players.

Less casual arena teams = less people to beat up on = lower ratings for dedicated PvPers.<br />

I can't say that my casual team will be back--I still want to but I don't know how to motivate the rest of my team if there are no rewards for us. I don't want it all--I'm fine with not getting shoulders or the weapon--but under this system, I won't be seeing the chest or helm either. Gloves and pants are not enough reason to go on.<br />

For those saying &quot;sucky people will stop arenaing,&quot; I highly doubt it. You can still get the S3 rings, necklace, and get 4/5 S3 armor with 0 rating. And if you guys start working now, you can get all the S3 belts bracers and boots in the next 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
And even then, getting the S4 chests and legs.. come on.. 1600 rating? It's not hard. <br />
<br />
<br />
I guess the only surprise comes as boots being rated 1700, since many people may consider 1700 to be the cut off for average PVPers, but IMO, I dont think hitting 1800 is all that difficult so long as you have dedicated partners.<br />
<br />
So is full S4 character &gt; 4/5 S3 character? Sure. But it's minimal, IMO. <br />
<br />
I will admit this tho, 2050 for s4 weapons is high (and this is coming from someone who hovers around 2000 normally). This makes me both happy and worried; happy cause yeah, I'm sick and tired of utter noobs being able to be power lvled to 1850 to get their weaps, and sad because 2050 is quite a task to do especially since these days I'm a causual player.<br />
<br />
But casual or not, I can just grind with my partner all weekend if need be to hit 2050 if I really really want the S4 weapons and shoulders.<br />
<br />
All in all, its a decent change. I'm more excited about the match making changes that will take place.<br />

Blizzard virtualy kills the whole arena with these changes but it will be a slow death and probably take some month for player numbers to decrease as there are still a few Items you can spend your points on.<br />
<br />
This is probably intended because at that point of time WotLK will give the opportunity to reset the arena and start over anew with level 80 S1-gear.<br />
<br />
It also means that if you plan to get S4-weapons and shoulders you better do it quick because ist will be impossible when the season is near its end...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I can see a lot of the under represented classes quitting. Pallies, mages, and hunters esp. BLizz should really adjust the imbalance and make classes more viable before they attach PR to everything. For example I play a mage and rogue. My mage only has one combo for 2's that does well (mage/rogue), and one combo for 3's that does well (PMR Duh). My rogue can play a ton of different combos to make the team work. I feel the most sorry for pallies. They only excel in 5's and gawd knows how hard it is to hold a consistent 5s team together for weeks at a time. <br />
<br />
To all the ppl that say reroll just STFU. No one wants to waste 100 hrs and half an arena season to get marginally geared. Without access to powerlevling and 4/5 S4 pcs rerollers will be continually outgeared.</div></div><hr />

And the honor items? Good lord. I now feel guilty for my past tirades about this if it winds up taking a boot to the entire notion of casual PvP.<br />
<br />
I wholeheartedly agree with this post. It will be a real hassle to get back into competion with your reroll even if you were a good way above the old reqs with your previous character. <br />
And I do think there should be some part available to casual pvpers too. Remember, for one team to rise in rating, another has to drop in rating. <br />
Casuals will get their gloves, but I think they have points for them already. Then the previous non-casual pvpers will have to fight eachother for those rating scraps, for a casual won't be able to rise above 1550 unless they play a resto druid...<br />
<br />
I have friends who play, some of them pvp on a casual level, and it would be sad if arena, which is good fun, would not be available for them. <br />
To everyone who will say &quot;who cares about them they don't deserve those items&quot;, a big STFU in advance so I won't have to bother with it later - these people are the WoW player base, and if they aren't entertained by both pvp and pve, most medium population servers will turn into Wyoming... *tumbleweed*</div></div><hr />

I've already have made threads, rants in the past about shitty players leeching a full set of armor with a 1400 rating, but I immensely disagree with leaving ratings on *any* S3 equipment (considering how absurdly high they are as well, who the hell is going to be buying them?) and ESPECIALLY S4 honor gear, which is one of the few crutches of the ailing BG system. <br />
<br />
There ain't just one level of casual either, and that also doesn't include new players or new characters. This will assuredly fuck some people over, especially those new or playing catch up, I've already lost enough playing friends to the stagnation of BC.<br />
<br />
System changes; good. S4 ratings; good. S3 rating remnants and honor system ratings; ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

I generally play 10-15 games a week and hover in the 1550- 1650 range (have gotten to 1700 a couple of times). For people like me, the better items are not possible. If they follow the trend they have started, it will get to a point where the previous season's items will require a rating as well (like the S3 Weapons and Shoulders will in S4). <br />
<br />
After S5 hits, the S4 items will probably have their rating only slightly lowered. When that happens, why should average players even bother?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skideff</div><div class="date">2008-04-23, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just like old BG honor system. Not a new one.<br />
Seperating people like old days - Arena/Raid. Good for Raid teams because lots ppl won't play Arene anymore, so Raid teams could solve their recruiting problem much easier. But, what about ppl who doesn't have enough time to raid/skills to competing in Arena? They will be gone.<br />
I don't say this decision is good or bad, but 'Mistakes'. When MMO gets old, the system should reflect the age of the game instead of repeating it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aRtFuL</div><div class="date">2008-04-23, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rating on S4 arena gear is a good thing. However as others said b4 I think there is very little point in maintaining any sort of rating on s3 gear, otherwise lower rating people won't have anything to aim for.<br />
<br />
Also, bg gear shouldn't even go by arena rating imo. It should go by it's own rating (ie. kills vs deaths over objective achieved etc). Arena people who are good in arena are not necessary skilled in bg because it is a different game, just like world pvp is a separate beast again. Arena is too fair, doesn't allow deception or treachery, they don't necessary perform well in other pvp environments. I've seen this often. No point in them getting reward for bg just because they are good at 1 type of pvp, just as if pvers are not getting rewarded in arena setting if they don't arena well.<br />
<br />
In fact, I think bg should have it's own separate system of gear away from arena, focus entirely on battlefield utility, not on personal survivability; allow people to distinguish what they are good at.<br />
<br />
Also, I think what Blizz will implement will just put rating buying on a different direction instead of changing it. People will now get someone who is damn geared in their team and fight their ratings up, because now who will face is based on the average rating of everyone. I think this system is going to not achieve anythign significant in fixing point/rating buying problem.<br />
<br />
IMO no one should be allow to change teams after the season starts. It should be like a sports team - you either quit team and be free agent, or the team can trade you off for someone else in exchange for points + crappier player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you down a scripted boss, you have many many tries a night to down them. You can pop consumeables, buffs, use big cooldowns to get ahead but in Arena 99% of those buffs are not available.<br />
<br />
If you don't play one of the OP classes then it becomes extremely difficult to overcome some of the OP classes that together make it almost impossible to beat.<br />
<br />
1900 rating is achieveable by mildly good players on a decent server in 3v3 but on a good server its almost impossible just to get out of 1700 without seeing full S3/T6 teams.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard is shooting themselves here, I expect damage control within 1 week or else, after S4 then Blizz makes a hotfix to lower the ratings when they see account cancellations.<br />
<br />
That baldy guy Kalgan maybe getting a little too carried away this time. Arena isn't easy when the game is heavily imbalance, fix the game then slap on decent ratings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not about difficulty: it's a pure percentages game. They know what % of their players have T6 gear, they know what % can achieve that rating in arena. Perceived difficulty has nothing to do with it: it's just numbers.</div></div><hr />

i am not interested in wellfare epics, never was, never will be. What I am interested in is a arena system that actually is somewhat fair, even for late starters. they should introduce permanent rating requirement, so a player cannot wear an equipment if he is playing in a low ranking team after he got his stuff.<br />
I used to play arena for some casual fun, that has changed a while ago.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">axi0m</div><div class="date">2008-04-23, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My only real issue with this is the offset items and it's kinda throwing a wrench in the &quot;pseudo-casual&quot; playerbase.<br />
<br />
I've got 4 70's and a 5th on the way (2 warriors a lock and a ret/prot paladin)<br />
<br />
I was looking at gladiator title on my warrior in s1 before I had some RL issues come up and couldn't keep up with my games and was on the way in s2 before my partner decided to quit the game (this was in 2's with a priest) decided to try out ret on my paladin in s3, picked up the honor s1 gear and 2 s3 pieces and my offset stuff (already had vets so just upgraded to vindi). I do alright in arena I've got a nice amount of resil a good weapon (not s3) but I play with my friends mostly, and a lot of the &quot;good&quot; players that I could get these ratings with already have steady teams and no reason to play with another person.<br />
<br />
That's where my problem with the rating req on the offset pieces.<br />
<br />
I'm a skilled player, not the best sure, but in order to compete you need to somewhat have on par gear, and if you look at the resil difference between s1/s2 and s3 gear on ret paladins specifically there's a HUGE gap. I'm working on my s3 stuff now in hopes of getting a decent enough amount of gear to be able to compete in s3, but a ret paladins viability is somewhat limited to specific comps for 2s/3s and 5s. Sure it's possible to break 2k get the gear etc, but at what cost? Dumping my friends? Cancelling raids that I'm supposed to MT for because my &quot;new team&quot; wants to play some games? Just so I can get a couple offset pieces which I can't get the non-rating version of because they're being removed?<br />
<br />
What if I want to start pvping on a new alt (like the rogue I'm making) how am I expected to get enough rating to buy the offset pieces if even with full s1 or s2 and weapons I'm missing key pieces and a huge chunk of resil? 1600-1800 is doable probably in crap gear with a geared out disc priest in a cookie cutter comp sure but since when has the &quot;fun&quot; of pvp involved having to ditch your friends, cancel raids, and bust ass just to &quot;compete&quot; on an &quot;even&quot; playing ground?<br />
<br />
I don't want easy epics, hell I agree on the arena pieces requiring rating, don't get me wrong the stuff is too easy to get as it is, but I think people who don't like arena or just do it on the side for fun or want to START competing seriously should at least be able to get a &quot;full&quot; pvp set without having to stress or worry about rating or playing comps that they don't find fun. Hell I ran a 5's comp with 3 bm hunters a ret pally and a warlock, our rating was complete ass but it was fun as hell. I'm discouraged now from leveling my rogue because I wanted to do some serious competition but now that I realize I can't even get a full set to START competing in without having to get through all the ex-glad teams who sit around the 1500-1700 bracket to try and get rating just to get a piece of offset gear, it just seems kind of silly to me.<br />

That is not fun, that is just pure crap and actually ruined the game for me. <br />
With the new rules comming, I am not seeing anything big that prevents this from happening again in the next season. If I want to get ganked in a unfair fight I can go to strangle and get my twink insta gibbed.. umm. no thanks. Until blizz actually introduces a System that is not so easily exploitable at the cost of the broad casual gamers, I will just pause playing this game.<br />
<br />
I really don't know why Blizz has so much trouble of thinking of a better arena system. They should look at how the real sports world works and adapt this method into the Arena system. Leagues is the magic word. Divide the Arena Teams in Leagues and only allow the best of the best gear to be worn in the top league. In the lower leagues only sub class gear is wearable, but at least the teams have equal gear and have a goal to fight for: To reach a better league, attain better gear. If a top player quits a top league team, well, he cannot war that gear in a lower league anymore.<br />
It could be so easy, but what blizz is doing right now is trying to fix a dead horse, rather then taking a step back and think of a system that actually makes sense and is FUN.<br />
<br />
<br />
here is a short high concept:<br />
<br />
there are a maximum 5 leagues. League 1 is the top league, League 5 the bottom league.<br />
For example, in league 1 the best gear is wearable (ie item level 159), in league 5 everything up to level 125 items (this is adjusted each season).<br />
<br />
based on teams enlisted, the size of the leagues is calculated. What remains is, each lower league is double the size of the league above. As an example here, League 1 has 32 teams, league 2 64, league 3 128, league 4 256, league 5 512.<br />
<br />
at the start of a new season, all teams are in the lowest league. <br />
At the end of the first week: the best teams at the top of league 5 will fill up league 4 (256 teams go up) <br />
At the end of the second week: the best teams of league 4 (top half) go into league 3, the best teams of league 5 fill up league 4.<br />
<br />
after four weeks the best of the best teams reached the top league where the best gear is wearable.<br />
<br />
each week, the bottom 4th of a league is swapped with the equal amount of teams at the top of the the league underneath (bottom 8 teams of league 1 get exchanged with top 8 teams of league 2). Players can only switch teams inside the same league or lower league.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know, this idea will still need some work but I strongly believe that an interesting fight more often occurs when the fights are even and fair. A league system encourages the possibility that evenly geared and skilled people will meet in a match and have a great fight, while rewarding the better gamers with better gear in the top leagues.</div></div><hr />

This is an awesome idea but if you just think about it Blizzard will never implement it. Which brings me to a bigger problem is what to do about class balance. If u want to be at the top you are pretty much forced to spec a certain way/play a specific class. If they won't fix the basic arena system to make it much better what hope do we have for class balance. <br />
<br />
Personally this change doesn't anger me at all since I don't arena. I'm happy I don't have to grind honor again to get those minor upgrades, saves me bunch of time. I'll be happy when I renew and am able to get S2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually to be honest. Resilience didn't really kill PvP. Armor Penetration did. If you haven't checked out the Tournament Realm yet, you will see they use Season 2. Which has no (almost positive) ArP.<br />
<br />
Anyways thank you finally for putting ratings on all pieces :)</div></div><hr />

People can still get decent gear through the honor grind (S2) and competitive gear (S3) through just farming Arena points. Farming points won't be as quick and easy as it has been. I doubt this will totally eliminate team/point selling, but it will make it a lot harder. 4 good players can likely continue to carry a 4th player for a sum of gold.<br />
<br />
I think adding ratings to most of the gear just makes it that much cooler. When you see someone with a certain piece of raid gear, you know how far his guild has progressed. Now when you see someone with a certain piece of Arena gear, you'll know how far their Arena team has gotten. I'm very happy about this news. No more 1300-1400 scrubs running around naked in Arenas for free epics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There ain't just one level of casual either, and that also doesn't include new players or new characters. This will assuredly fuck some people over, especially those new or playing catch up, I've already lost enough playing friends to the stagnation of BC.<br />
<br />
System changes; good. S4 ratings; good. S3 rating remnants and honor system ratings; ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I agree with this. Even the casuals would have had time to do 10 arena games every other week with an around 1500 team, for the long duration of s3, and get enough points to buy 3-4 S3 epics. As it goes, these players would have the gloves from S4 to buy. The argument is that these people would be able to buy s3 instead of the s4 which requires ratings, because they don't deserve s4 pieces, which I can agree with.<br />
They'd have s3 shoulders and weapons available, but now with rating remnants on these items, they are restricted for those aswell. <br />
<br />
Which makes no sense at all. Especially the shoulders. The original idea with rating reqs was to give the full gladiator look only to real gladiators. Makes as much sense as the need for pve attunements/need for gear to progress in harder instances. Which is a lot of sense.<br />
<br />
BUT. When season 4 comes, who will care about s3 shoulders? They'll be old news. I see no need to restrict the purchase of those any longer, because you'll be able to see the real gladiators from the s4 shoulders. And s3 shoulders just won't be impressive anymore. Plus, it'd be leaving a cookie for the casuals-semi casuals to keep doing arena... which I think they have a right to. We can throw them that bone, it's not a big deal. Same goes with honor epics. BGs should be something else apart from the arenas. They require a different logic and a different playstyle, and even if a lot of players play BGs like drones, it IS possible to excel at them and have a lot of fun there. Every routined BG player will have the last season's honor epics, and they'll be waiting for some new carrots.</div></div><hr />

It feels equally good to know that people who are so short-sighted and narrow minded won't be getting the gear either.<br />
<br />
Win-trading aside, you won't have the teams to beat to get to or maintain a 2200 rating.<br />
_________________________________________________<br />
<br />
I very much echo the sentiment of others who feel S3 gear should lose it's rating. <br />
<br />
Let the &quot;hardcore&quot; PvPers have the S4 Gear for looks and to stroke their own ego with, but for the love of god let the new players have access to full Season 3 gear so they stand a chance of even getting to 2200 with some skill.<br />
<br />
As things stand - I need to play Arena for roughly 5 weeks @ 10 games then I have enough points to get free gloves every season for the next year. Why bother after that?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diosx</div><div class="date">2008-04-23, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
personally I'm a bit shocked that most of think that this are all good changes. Just to give the pro players a different point view.<br />
<br />
I'm playing with two very good friend of mine, just to say this straight we are not very good in arena, but we are contented to have a good 50%/50% win/loose. We play for our own fun and so our setup is a bit &quot;strange&quot; and propably our setup allone will keep us from going any way higher. This way we stay at about 1500 rating for a whole season and it takes us about 8! weeks to get one so-called wellfare epic. <br />
<br />
I personally think it's a good idea to have personal/team rating requirements on some or all arena items. But leaving them on items which are &quot;out of date&quot; or having them on items that you &quot;earn&quot; (better grind) in battlegrounds is just crazy.<br />
<br />
In my battlegroup alliance has a 2 - 8 ratio of winning a bg, sometimes 1 - 20. (The reason for this is a different story, but I personally think the days alliance was just bad and horde good are long gone. The problem is that horde is way better equiped. This way they win more matches and get even better equiped).<br />
<br />
Conclusion: With the new requirements, Arena and BG-PvP are practically over for me and my 2 friends. Some of you will say we don't deserve good equipment because we are not good enough. But I think having to wait 8 weeks for 1 item, whereas the 2000+ teams get 3-4 items in the same time, is a good compensation for being 50/50.<br />
Furthermore having rating requirements on BG-items is just ridiculous. So I do 20-30 BGs every day (just hypothetical and as an alliance player i would propably loose 18-28 of these matches), grind my way to having enoug points and marks to buy one! item, but hey, I won't get it, because I have no arena team. And even if I had one, I would have to have a minimum rating of 1575 to get an item.<br />
<br />
So: Requirements on S4, ok. S3 not ok, BG just crazy and this will end PvP for most casual players, i predict.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(English is not my native language, so please excuse me if the mistakes I made brought you to tears ;))<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Some of you may say that raiders have a harder time getting their stuff compared to the 1500-teams, that may be true, but I've been raiding, and I've seen people &quot;leeching&quot; rewards in raid dungeons like they are doing it in BGs. So, to say someone in their T6 has truly earned that equipment is, in my opinion, too naive. For most of them, it may be true, but surely not all of them.<br />
And one last thing, that will propably earn me the hatred of all the raiders out there, PvE is just human vs computer, and will, for still a long time, be easier than human vs human.</div></div><hr />

It will feel even better hearing the complaints of former 2200+ rating gladiators having to fight each other to get past 1700 because thats the level the top teams will be playing on in a few month from now.<br />

so what is the difference between selling points/wintrading in arena and selling tier 6 and the other items from sunwell, for me it seems that they are the same thing, care to explain what I am doing wrong then?</div></div><hr />

Who is being disadvantaged by someone buying Tier 6 levels of gear?<br />
<br />
As compared to the people in lower arena brackets being disadvantaged by the scrub you just sold enough points for 4/5 S3 to that is now fighting in the 1500's bracket.</div></div><hr />

With the new rating requirements, everyone will have all the gear they can get very fast. The good teams who can get more items also get points quickly. The average teams can only get about half the gear and, wow, only get about half the points. And of course the bad teams can’t get much gear so they won’t have to get slaughtered for very long either. <br />
<br />
All in all, the forethought that Bliz puts into PvP and Arena changes is just staggering…</div></div><hr />

2. PvP and Arenas were perfectly suited for casuals. The only difference of a casual from a &quot;pro&quot; is the time in which they get gear.

Moving Quality PvP Gear to Hardcores Only section will only decrease motivation of the masses to do PvP, thus hurting this whole game...<br />

<br />
If they stick with current trends, this will only apply to non-weapon, non-shield off-hands. So basically just caster off-hands. I would imagine, though, that the Thrown weapon will also not require rating. Possibly the Hunter stat-bat will also still not require rating.</div></div><hr />

The desire to deny _other_ people items, may very well have come back and bit these folks in the backside. Guess what? Arenas may have just shifted the picture such that instead of being in the 90th percentile in the local community college, you now have to get that same 90th percentile in MIT. You're still smart, but you won't be making the dean's list.<br />
<br />
The more teams there are...the more room there is at the top. Lesser-skilled / casual / non-optimally-balanced teams willingly served as fodder because there was always the allure of eventually getting access to really nice gear. As prior posters have mentioned, a very plausible future includes far fewer teams participating. As that happens, ratings will shift to accomodate the voids. Time will tell whether participation changes or not, so we can all just stay tuned :)<br />
<br />
Honestly, maybe this is the way it should have been from day one. Personally, I never expected arenas to become the massive behemoth it is today. However, as soon as it was made known that complete sets of uber gear were achievable simply by saving points...well, the wheels were set in motion. These changes will likely be for the better of the Arena system. Perhaps it will even lessen the recent proliferation of Arena-based class changes. It's often hard to &quot;take away&quot; something after having been given for so long, but who knows...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seiken</div><div class="date">2008-04-24, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me sketch the idea many people seem to miss.<br />
<br />
Rating on Honor items means people that afk in bg's and know nothing about PvP and only use their s3/4 equavalent in kara/gruul are now excluded from getting those items. The difference between s3 and s4 is horribly overestimated.<br />
If you compare season 1 with 3 the ammount of resilience that increases is about... 1-10? 10 resilience max... wow, sure makes me feel better... No, it's not a big difference, not to mention s3 will be closer to s4 then s1 is to s3. So season 3 gear suits the casual people just fine. Now why oh why did they maintain rating on weapons and shoulders of season 3? Weapons are equal to high end raiding items, way too good to just give away, actually, they give them away at the armor vendor on the sunwell Ilse... And not many teams will be able to get 2200 rating because as mentioned before less teams will play, more skilled players meet skilled players at lower ratings. So season 3 shoulders would still give a tiny bit of status (lol)... Also as I haven't noticed anyone saying... Shouldn't this keep FOTM rerollers out of the arena bracket? No more druids farming s1/s3 honor gear and get 1850-2000 in a month? If it does keep them out, less classes get horribly nerfed and nerfs them in PvE aswell (Which I agree is stupid as a PvP player).<br />
<br />
So basically, giving away s3 weapons and s4 honor gear is kinda stupid, even though people think that 1 resilience more or less loses them a game, it will come down to skill (hopefully) since Wintrading will stop at 1650-1750 and only the &quot;skilled&quot; will fight... Wouldn't happen due great imbalance of classes, though mirrors take more skill then class OP'ness</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most people can still compete in PvP. Your char isn't awsome for 2v2? Get a team in a different bracket! Every class has atleast one spec that's viable in some bracket. Its hard to find 5v5s? Too bad for you! Everything else that consistently yields epics (heroics and up) require atleast 5 people. You'll just have to start making the same effort as people who do heroics. Oh woe is you! I cant successfully raid 25 mans as a SL/SL lock, you shouldn't get the best PvP rewards as a holy priest. Respec or gtfo!<br />
<br />
If you wanna keep doing PvP with your survival hunter friend in 2v2 but still want better gear, you can just join a more compeditive 3v3 or 5v5 for rating, and still play 2v2 with your buddy. If you cant manage that, you cant care that much about PvP gear anyway, or you're just too bad to get rating in any bracket. <br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind that with point selling being nerfed, there will be far fewer gladiators in the 1500, killing the average players, so it will be easier for people who want to improve to do so. Boosting will be less useful too, since there will be fewer scrub teams to boost against, but it wont disaper completely. So yes, you wont be able to instantly throw on S4 gear, but the people you face wont either. And if you DO face someone in S4 gear, they will beat you cause they're better PvPers, and gear wouldn't have made a difference. Fewer people will have the most uber gear (just like in PvE) but anyone who puts in some effort can still get really good gear. <br />
<br />
Arena was never intended to be the free gear for everyone thing it has become today. It was suppose to be a PvP system that rewards degree of success, not time spent. Because of how PvP works, even the losers has to be able to get something, which they can: S3 gear. But the winners get more, better, faster. Start making an effort, start raiding, or start QQing more.</div></div><hr />

But, with almost all the S4 gear having rating requirements, if he trend continues, it will be much harder for people to get S4 gear once S5 opens - assuming they keep ratings on all gear.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with requiring ratings for the present season's best gear. I do think it is unfair to have ratings on the previous season's gear. As soon as Season 4 opens, all seasons 3 gear should be available for purchase with no rating req. As soon as S5 begins, all S4 items should be available with no rating req. This would allow people to gear up and compete.</div></div><hr />

However, I am a casual player and only adequate at PvP. I will not get most of these items probably due to the rating. Its totally cool. I think the ratings are great! If there is an issue where the ratings are too high (or low) or not enough items are making it into the game, Blizz can easily adjust it again later. Its a great experiment to foster more competition and a step in the right direction. <br />
<br />
Play what you love and the gear will follow...don't play for gear...gear is transitory. Its the spirit of competition that should drive arena (and BGs for that matter). When my team loses an arena match, its usually because they have better class mix and better strategy, not because of gear. After a match, the team discusses strategy - not the gear of the opposing team.<br />
<br />
Watch out in S4, I might just be motivated enough by the new rating requirements to step up my game. 1600 rating here I come :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There will be people in full S4 wanting to make easy money. With the changes to point selling they will do it by boosting scrubs. These teams will start at 1500 rating.<br />
<br />
All the teams that would have just given away slots (and therefore created easy games) on a high rated 7/3 team will instead be boosting people on a 1500 team. All this is besides the point, the arena will become the playground for FotM teams and classes that have not been nurfed out of competitiveness.<br />
<br />
With a S3 geared enhance shammy and holy pally, I really can't be bothered playing only 5v5 trying to find times when every one is online only to have to compete with all the warrior/druid rogue/X teams that have got their gear from brackets I am not allowed to play in. <br />
<br />
It was fun while it lasted, now I will just have to content myself when all the point sellers / scrub bashers get stuck at 1900 and qq about not getting their S4 :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Create a 3v3 team and pay 2 experienced/skilled people to play with you, play with them everyweek increasing your peronal rating. Wouldnt this still work? Granted you may never actually hit above 2000 unless the two are insanely good players.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't think someone will pay for such a thing. They'll want the Rating and so you need 2 really op people to pull you to 2200 in 2v3.<br />
<br />
I cant imagine someone will manage this. IF they could it would be so stupidly expensive that you anyway wont see may of these teams so wouldn’t care much about this.<br />
<br />
Cant Blizz just give personal rating to everyone and throw away teamratings plx? <br />
So you just wont meet those 5/5 S4 guise unless you are insanely uberskilled or really also have the same gear/skill = making it ALWAYS depend on skill.<br />
<br />
Also it would get a lot easier to get to a normal rating if you don’t have to chew your way through overgeared people in the 1500-1850’s.</div></div><hr />

Head: 1700<br />
Chest: 1600<br />
Legs: 1550<br />

<br />
If you have a resto druid in your arena team, all costs are increased 100 rating, same goes for MS warriors. If you are a resto druid or MS warrior the rating requirement goes up an additional 100 points. <br />
<br />
Its great and all that I dont want guys running around in free amazing epics, but balance the classes a bit more first. Playing arena on my recently rerolled pally is like pulling teeth all I see if 4/5 S3 equipped guys, when I have S1 gear at best....I might as well pvp naked.</div></div><hr />

WTF was wrong with getting highwarlord or the field marshal rank for some of the best gear. I would to be able to get high warlord on my mage. By the time i got him 60 and got to blood guard they took the changes out. pvp was far more enjoyable pre-bc. I say to end all the fighting just set things back to the way they where pre-bc. Atleast with the titles and such. I am saying this from a psuedo pro/casual player that just really loves hitting things with a big 2 handed mace :P. <br />
<br />
Class balance will never happen so no reason to cry about that. only thing i can say is realize how the &quot;op&quot; classes are beating you then try and figure out what their weakness is. for example a mediocre ret pally can rape a resto druid. <br />
<br />
just to recap bring back bg titles and stopping crying over game balance that will never happen. have a good day<br />

Level 60 PvP was basically just a race to who could do the most BGs and really needed time over skill. Now that PvP (arena) is a lot more competitive it's only in it's place that the very best items are harder to obtain. This actually applied pre-TBC as well, the only difference was that in the arena, if you got the knowledge and skill needed, you can succeed without pissing away weeks and months of your life for the sakes of farming honor, becoming completely isolated from your outside world which is one of the very few things that I like about the whole casual-friendly thing that Blizzard did.<br />

Yet you still find people complaining, though I can understand their frustration, I usually find their arguments regarding the lack of balance for their specific off-spec in arena void to a very high degree as everyone is forced to respec for arenas if they're actively doing PvE. Even warriors have to either spec back from Protection, Fury or Slam (33/28 with no second wind, no imp intercept, no imp hamstring and several other crucial talents for PvP) so their sulking is really not based upon justifying grounds.</div></div><hr />

I have Justicar title and have over 250 000 kills (The toon is a mage and been playing on him for a year now, well since tbc came out).<br />
<br />
For people to claim that that achievement just took time and not skill is a slap in my face and others who have achieved the same thing and more. I only do around 1-3 hours every 2 days (and quite a bit on the weekends). I dominate scoreboards on every BG I go into. I'm using S1 gear which I got from 2v2 in season 1 (had a rating of around 2000 - 2100), stop doing Arena because I didn't like the fact that I had to spec frost everytime for it. (yea the only apparently viable spec for mages) <br />
<br />
So I guess I will have to live with the fact that I will be getting the leftover PVP gear that comes from Arena, only because I choose to play PVP with a fire spec or elemental spec.<br />
<br />
Which is not a problem, because it will be sweet pawning their sweet little S4 asses with my puny S2 leftovers in battlegrounds, where a real more balanced (all specs viable) war is going on.<br />
<br />
So much for skill gets you gear.....<br />
<br />
If Blizzard wants to bring skill to arena all they have to do is take away teams and pug people together. lol<br />
<br />
Yea would be funny to see what would happen, but then your personal rating would be true. Personal rating is a joke because its not really gained by yourself, so why call it personal...I feel for the people who actually enjoy pvping with their favorite 'personal' specs only to find out its not viable for arenas.<br />
<br />
Anyways peaceout and see your in battlegrounds. <br />
<br />
PS: Bring your S4 epics, I got a fireball waiting for them ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrkoonia</div><div class="date">2008-04-30, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My views are clearly not in majority here but...<br />
Regarding the personal rating requirements on S4 gear. (I guess few ´have anything against changes limiting rating boosting etc.)<br />
<br />
First a questions to all &quot;Yeah, at last&quot; sayers.<br />
Why are you positive to these changes ?<br />
Is it because better arena players should have a more unique look and be able to easier recognise them when strutting around in Shattrah ?<br />
Or is it because the better arena players should have an even more easy way of dispatching players with less skill than they have today ?<br />
Or any other reason ?<br />
<br />
My view is that the arena should offer an as fair play field as possible (I know that gear collecting is more or less what this game all about, but anyway...). Why should better players with higher ranking be allowed to have even another edge against players with less skill. It's more or less like saying that next season only Man United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal will be allowed to use football shoes with &quot;spikes&quot; underneath in Premier League, the teams of lesser ranking is not good enough to be allowed to compete in a level basis...<br />
<br />
Flame away ?<br />

<br />
atm i play 2v2 with a disc priest and we doing ok my only snag about the way its going is in the future if they follow the same path its gonna be near on impossible to make a decent team from scratch.<br />
<br />
me and my 2 friends irl where gonna lvl lock druid and rogue for a 3v3 but im not so sure i wanna go down that path now the way it is yea i would but in the future will it really be worth even playing arena from a starting point of view,</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hagen</div><div class="date">2008-04-30, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, maybe this is the way it should have been from day one. Personally, I never expected arenas to become the massive behemoth it is today. However, as soon as it was made known that complete sets of uber gear were achievable simply by saving points...well, the wheels were set in motion. These changes will likely be for the better of the Arena system. Perhaps it will even lessen the recent proliferation of Arena-based class changes. It's often hard to &quot;take away&quot; something after having been given for so long, but who knows...<br />
<br />
<br />
The Arena losing it's importance may be good for the game as a whole though it makes me sad that the only good pvp option for casuals will be gone soon.<br />
<br />
Playing battlegrounds is not fun anymore. In fact after playing 2-3 bgs in a row i get angry and start to insult people because half of them is either afk-leeching or prefers a quick loss to a hard-earned victory. Honor per hour is more importent to a lot of players than actually winning a game...<br />
<br />
Arena is a whole different story. Though my teams never made it past 1700 (due to bad setups, not playing pure PvP-speccs, lack of equipment skill and experience) it was very satisfying to play with - and against - people who are willing to put up a good fight.<br />
<br />
But to fight for points we can't really spend for anything does not look appealing to us particularly considering the fact that we won't make it past 1200 next season with all that former gladiators dropping to 1600 rating...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">razzy</div><div class="date">2008-04-30, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">theres more to it than that, you wont be fighting full geared s3/s4 monsters, in you level, ie you wont face teams who are 200 or so points higher than yourselves anymore, they are trying to balance teams using ratings, so its fair throughout and everyone has a fighting chance to hit high ratings. team selling will be gone and its not practical to have booster teams, from what i have read you will only get points if your personal is 150 or less to the team rating. so if you find yourself around 1600-1700 with 5k points your lacking skill in a big way, if thats team setup or just player failure, thats anyones guess, but imo its for the best and long awaited.<br />
<br />
as for the full geared players, they will rapidly move out of your point area, so to start you might find it hard as will everyone but when they get 2k or so you wont meet them until you hit 2k or there abouts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There isn't that much of a difference between S1 and S3 (apart from armor pen).<br />
<br />
Does anyone else feel like a broken record?</div></div><hr />

well thats dependant, for a casual player which the guy clearly stated he is (post above), seeing some guy in full s3 your kinda expecting to lose, if you dont have equal gear, s3 warriors are a general pain for my setup when with a druid, but a s1 warrior is easy meat. dont try tell me it isnt gear dependant because it clearly is. and yes i have around 1000 armour ignore, makes life easier i must say. s1 gear and s3 gear are a total different kettle of fish and there is a decent amount of difference. think before you speak.</div></div><hr />
