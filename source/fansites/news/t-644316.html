Patch 3.1 - Ulduar Loot Update<br />
We can finally start discovering new items from Ulduar now that a few guilds are taking down the first bosses of the instance. There aren't many items for the moment but you can expect a lot more updates like this one in the next days! There is also a small fishing reward, most likely a rare loot from the new daily quests. <br />

<br />
Recent In-Game Fixes - 4/16/09<br />
Listed below are recent fixes we have applied to the game.<br />
<br />
4/16/09<br />
We have made it so player cannot attack additional quest giver NPCs at the Argent Tournament.<br />
Pets have been properly trained to now attack Kologarn when instructed.<br />
Hunter pets should now have their talents refunded when a hunter switches talent specs, even if they are dismissed at the time.<br />
When re-implemented into the game, the trash mobs before XT-002 Deconstructor should be a little easier to defeat.<br />
Blood Boil should no longer penetrate Ice Block or Divine Shield.<br />
Rank 2 of maim should now correctly provide an interrupt effect.<br />
Improved Aspect of the Hawk should no longer allow Rapid Regeneration to provide additional mana beyond the intended scope of the ability.<br />
Players killed or ghosts that move into Crystalsong Forest should now be on a spectral gryphon to ride back to their body.<br />
Champion of the Frozen Wastes should now be able to be completed again.<br />
Lifebloom can no longer be forced to bloom early.<br />
Stunning a druid while not in cat form should no longer remove the Primal Tenacity buff.<br />
The Glyph of Envenom was not supposed to be put into the game and has been removed.<br />
Quest giving NPCs at the Argent Tournament should no longer be able to be attacked by players.<br />
Certain fishing nodes for one of the fishing daily quests should no longer be spawned on land.<br />
The book of glyph mastery has had its drop rate increased.<br />
T.N.T. should now properly increase the damage of Explosive Trap.<br />
The disarm effect from Psychic Horror should no longer be able to be dodged.<br />
Players should no longer be able to equip and soulbind an item they aren’t able to use.<br />
<br />
Ignis Hotfixes<br />
We've made some changes to Ignis' melee attack on Heroic. We reduced his overall melee DPS by about 15% and he swings faster which will make his individual hits less devastating.<br />
In normal mode we increased the cooldown of Activate Construct from 30 to 40 seconds.<br />
We also decreased the damage of the Scorch ground effect by 20% on both difficulties.<br />
<br />
On a side note, Ignis has always had the flag that prevents parries from making his next melee swing happening faster.<br />
<br />
We're still working on the people being melee'd in the slag pot issue, this one is proving tricksy. <br />
<br />
Regarding Hot Hot Hot Streak/Flawless Victor<br />
We have removed this achievement and the title it rewarded because it was often being earned through methods that were not what we wanted to encourage. We currently have an idea to bring it back soon, and hope that players with the current titles will get to keep them but we can make no guarantees at this time. <br />
<br />
WoW Account Compensation<br />
The compensation affects both US and EU accounts. (EU Announcement (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/8797811034-1604-wow-account-compensation.html))<br />
World of Warcraft saw many new features and additions added to the game with the launch of our latest content patch, Secrets of Ulduar. While we anticipated extended downtime for this patch, the actual downtime exceeded our expectations and after they came online players have experienced long petition wait times. At this time, many of the issues that caused these problems have been addressed and resolved.<br />
<br />
In light of these circumstances, all North American, Latin American, and Oceanic accounts that are active and in good standing will receive one free day of play time. This day of compensation should be applied and viewable in your account management page (www.worldofwarcraft.com/account (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account)) within the next 7 days. We thank you for your continued support of World of Warcraft and we’ll see you in game! <br />

Blue posts<br />
[b]Dual-Specialization<br />
We wanted swapping specs to be a decision, but not too much of a burden. That's a pretty narrow space in which to have the design land. By &quot;decision&quot; I meant that we didn't want to encourage you to swap specs every single pull. It's more like &quot;Hey, let's try this with one more healer,&quot; or &quot;Hey, we don't need two tanks this fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
We were particularly worried about it in the solo case. We didn't want say a shaman to kill a quest mob as Enhancement and then feel like what they are supposed to do is swap specs, heal, and then swap specs back to Enhancement to keep killing stuff. That feels like an awkward, painful way to play. In the current implementation there is no real motivation for doing that, so hopefully the specs feel more like &quot;this is my role right now&quot; and less like warrior stances or druid forms (I shift to cast a spell then shift back).<br />
<br />
This is however a brand new and fairly game-changing feature for us. We'll just have to see how it goes and get some more feedback. You can look at the history of things like hearthstones, flight paths or meeting stones to see how big features can evolve over time.

Argent Tournament<br />
Seals and Ranks<br />
You need 15 aspirant seals to get to rank 2 (valiant) then 25 valiant seals to get to rank 3 (champion). [...] When you change to another faction you start out as a valiant - they aren't so mean to put you back to an aspirant and whacking target dummies. So it is 25 seals/5 days to become a champion of another city. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16474147843-argent-tournament.html))<br />
<br />
Leveling reputation<br />
Keep in mind that as you represent a city, each daily you turn into them nets you reputation with that city. The champion reputation items are there for a little extra boost if you need it, that's all. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16473617963-argent-tournament-mounts.html))<br />
<br />
Argent Tournament Hippogryph choice of colors<br />
Concerning the Argent Tournament hippogryph's choice of colors, it was actually a reasoned choice. While I am very much aware of the meaning of the word &quot;argent,&quot; the Argent Crusade's colors are not only white/silver (argent) but gold as secondary and black as tertiary colors. With that in mind, the combination of the white and warm brown of the chosen hippogryph is indeed fitting for the faction in question. It complements its riders and its cause quite well. In addition, the white-blue hippogryph was already in use in the Silver Covenant area in Crystalsong Forest. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16417182541-the-argent-tournament-has-arrived.html))<br />
<br />
Ulduar<br />
Items dropping from Yogg-Saron aren't better than items dropping from other bosses<br />
With all the hard modes in Ulduar we felt it would be a better way to distribute the higher level gear. We want to reward players for completing the hardest content and not provide just a mount each time. [...] While we want the easiest mode to be accessible, we don't feel it needs to drop the best loot. Come back with fewer watchers helping when you want the best items in the game and a little bit of pain in wiping a lot. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16473757625-yoggsaron-loot.html))<br />
<br />
Ulduar normal mode<br />
The normal and most basic mode is something we want to be beatable by players. We want it to be fairly accessible and doable, not M'uru. [...] If the boss is really difficulty, it significantly cuts down on the number of people who get to see the content we worked really hard on. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16473757625-yoggsaron-loot.html))<br />
<br />
Ulduar difficulty level<br />
Obviously there are many guilds in many different stages of progression. While it is still early on, and some raid attempts have been delayed or canceled due to realm and instance issues Tuesday and Wednesday, most guilds are struggling to get past the first couple of bosses. <br />
<br />
[...] Keep in mind also that tricks to defeating bosses in Ulduar aren't so common knowledge as they were with Naxxramas, since the mechanics of those fights did not fundamentally change from the level 60 version. [...] These encounters should definitely be a new level of challenge for the average guild in Wrath of the Lich King. With that said, the type of difficulty of each encounter is being analyzed. For instance, if a boss is going to swing twice at a tank resulting in astronomical amounts of damage in a matter of seconds, that's a degree of difficulty that's worth further scrutinizing. <br />
<br />
Ulduar cleared in 2 days?<br />
Most people will consider Ulduar fully cleared when Algalon is defeated, myself included. He isn't optional in the sense of, &quot;hey, guys -- enjoy this bonus boss&quot;, he's actually designed to be the hardest encounter in Ulduar, and only accessible by completing a questline that requires players to complete multiple Ulduar hard modes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16474327864-ulduar-cleared-in-two-days.html))<br />
<br />
Yogg-Saron<br />
Yogg is hard but not soul-crushing. The guilds that were interested in advancing that quickly made some pretty heroic efforts to do so. They are also very good guilds. Now, if you (and they) are interested in soul-crushing, we offer that too. I am guessing some of the hard modes will be up for a long time. I know that is essentially issuing a challenge, so we'll see. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/16474237715-will-yogg-saron-be-adjusted.html))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Time needed to nerf classes<br />
Okay, since there were several replies who think the original question is really intresting and legitimate, I'll answer it. For the record, I don't think many players are interested in the answer (though some are). I suspect the real issue is that most locks agree Conflag was overpowered (though again we see a few who feel differently), but since being nerfed isn't fun, they want to have something to vent about, and venting about other classes not being nerfed is an attractive candidate.<br />
<br />
Why did we nerf Destro fast and Unholy / Holy slow?<br />
<br />
1) We did make several nerfs to DKs and paladins since LK shipped. None of them ended up having enough of an effect.<br />
<br />
2) Part of the reason DKs and paladins were dominant is because burst damage was high and they could survive it with their cooldowns. Burst damage isn't as high now and people have more resilience.<br />
<br />
3) Yet nerfing their cooldowns was risky. Nerf a DK's cooldowns too much and he can't tank. Nerf a paladin's cooldowns too much and you risk him not being able to tank (though it's less of an issue) but you could very well kill him in PvP. Bubbles are huge for paladins in PvP. Similarly, there wasn't another paladin healing tree, so nerfing Holy too much might just mean paladins can't heal (or Rets can't do damage -- and there are plenty of Rets who still think they were caught up in Holy nerfs).<br />
<br />
4) On the other hand, nerfing Conflag doesn't hurt locks in PvE. Why not? Because they have other specs they can do that do great dps. If the DK tank's spec gets nerfed, he's done as a tank. That player has to reroll for dps, or just stop PvE. (Yes, I understand you might love Destro and hate Demo and Affliction. That's still not quite the same as someone who is there to tank or heal and not to dps at all.)<br />
<br />
5) Nerfing say Icy Touch in a vacuum would have hurt DK PvE dps. (Though in retrospect, we probably should have done it anyway and just lived with the PvE consequences). The problem really wasn't Icy Touch itself, but all of the talents that the PvP DK build could cherry pick to improve Icy Touch. Moving those talents around is not the kind of thing we can hotfix. Again, even if Destro was totally dead for PvE (which I think is an exaggeration), the lock has other options.<br />
<br />
6) Other DK fixes would also have involved moving or removing talents (Shadow of Death), glyphs (Blood Boil), or enchants (Razorice). Again, those are hard to do without a major patch. The pet ghoul of Unholy is an enormous dps increase. Why? Because pets gain group buffs, but guardians (the standard ghoul) don't. That is hard to hotfix because there is nothing in between 0% of buffs and 100% of buffs. Moving that talent deeper (or removing it) were the only possible fixes. <br />
<br />
7) Let me elaborate a little more on that last point, because it's actually a difficult problem with the DK class. DKs don't have a resource system like mana. They generally aren't limited by cooldowns because of the rune mechanic. Unlike most other classes, they don't have a whole slew of &quot;makes X cheaper&quot; or &quot;lowers the cooldown of X&quot; talents. Their talents tend to be complicated, adding extra effects or procs. Those are hard to hotfix. The three trees share some abilities, but their talents push them off in very different ways. If you nerf Blood Strike's base damage, you might make it useless for another tree. It's hard to tweak DK numbers the same way you can every other class.<br />
<br />
8 ) DKs were a new class and paladins were redesigned. We didn't have the extensive history upon which to draw on them. With rogues or mages, the design space is better understood. Constantly when we discuss those classes a designer will say &quot;No, that would put them in the situation they were in before, which had these problems. Let's not go there again.&quot; With DKs especially, it wasn't always clear what the long-term ramifications of changes were going to be. Remember, Unholy became so powerful in part because we buffed the crap out of it coming out of Beta, because all the DKs were Blood and Frost and found Unholy gimmicky and disjointed. We test the changes, but that is no substitute for what happens when millions of players start playing dozens of hours a week with the changes. Stuff is going to come up the way it keeps coming up for the five-year old classes, just more often.<br />
<br />
I hope that explains it a little better. I don't expect you guys to give us the benefit of the doubt on stuff like this. I wouldn't if I were in your shoes. But it should at least occur to you that when you see an apparent inconsistency, the reason for that inconsistency is unlikely to be &quot;Oh that didn't occur to us&quot; or &quot;We just feel arbitrary.&quot; It's fine to ask if you're legitimately curious, and hopefully we can answer some of those questions. I would not immediately make the leap from legitimatey curious to conspiracy theories about class-ism.<br />
<br />
This was a long response and it will no doubt spawn lots of questions and assumption challenging (and more conspiracy theories). I've spent a ton of effort on this issue today, neglecting other classes in the process, so I might not have the bandwidth to handle much further exploration of the wall of text above. Apologies in advance. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16418332575-gc24-h-to-fix-locks-vs-5-months-for-dkpally.html))<br />

Exorcism<br />
Exorcism may be a PvP issue, particularly given its range. This is one of those cases though where if we just nerfed it, Ret probably would not be PvE viable.

Reflective Shield on other players<br />
We don't currently have plans for it to work on other players. We changed the way absorb mechanics work between Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King, which caused Reflective Shield to become self cast only. It was a sacrifice worth making, and so many discipline priests told us they loved Reflective Shield that even with the stipulation that it was going to work only on themselves, they still wanted the chance to get the talent so we kept it in.<br />
<br />
We can update the tooltip to say “priest only” though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137219996-reflective-shield-update.html))<br />

Orc Shamans and Axe Racial<br />
We looked at the loot table of Ulduar and were satisfied that there were sufficient slow off-hands available. However, we do think there is some validity to orc shamans not often being able to benefit from the axe racial. With so many one-handed items to make, we get much more use out of itemizing maces, fists and swords, since those can be used by more classes.

Lava Burst<br />
We have not made a change to Lava Burst at this time. I feel like I have to offer &quot;at this time&quot; or if we ever do decide to nerf it, we'll be accused of breaking promises. It's just been that kind of week. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16473908135-stealth-nerf-to-elemental.html))<br />

Upcoming Shard changes<br />
Shards aren't going anywhere. They are part of the warlock class. Campaigning to have them removed is like asking for shamans to lose totems or warriors to lose stances. We do have a plan to make shards much more interesting. It was too ambitious to be able to fit into 3.1.

Creating Soul Shards from Target Dummies<br />

Shattering Throw<br />
We wanted to give the ability to remove bubbles to a class other than priest’s Mass Dispel. Warriors had lost one of their unique PvP mechanics when other classes got Mortal Strike, which we thought was one of the abilities that had become too important for only one class to have in PvP (much like Mass Dispel). It seemed like a natural fit for warriors. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137621093-shattering-throw.html))</div></div><hr />

I assume that any Hunter using FotFF/Greatness is hit-capped without trinkets, so the Hit becomes fluff.<br />
<br />
Assuming a 3-minute (180 second) fight, a 2.9 weapon, and 10% haste from gear (2.30 autoshot)<br />
<br />
Blood: 4 procs of 1284 AP at 40 seconds each = 285.3~ average AP over the fight<br />
Fury: 12 GCDs and 8 autoshots to build to full AP (320) is 18.4 seconds = 287.28~ average AP over the fight not counting buildup time because I'm too lazy to calculate it<br />
<br />
Even discounting the buildup to 320, Fury is more AP average over a 3-minute fight, and I feel it only gets better as it gets longer, unless there's long gaps in fights. Even if there is, it only really becomes Mirror of Truth 3.0 (2.0 being Pyrite Infuser (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45286)).<br />
<br />
Maybe I just expected better from, y'know, Yogg-Saron loot. :P<br />

Edit: Though to get back on topic, I offer my congratulations to everyone downing Yoggy the last couple of days, and wish you all luck on the Algalon/Death's Demise race!</div></div><hr />

I'm mostly thinking that were you to get it, then you would get the chance to drop some gear with hit and replace it with gear with other stats. I don't have BiS trinkets as a hunter, but I do have Grim Toll, and when I got it, I regemmed/regeared a bit since I was over-hit, and my DPS got a nice boost out of it. It would be nice to grab the hit cap with only a few pieces of gear, then be able to gear for more AP and crit elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

Exorcism may be a PvP issue, particularly given its range. This is one of those cases though where if we just nerfed it, Ret probably would not be PvE viable.

Well, why don't they just put in the tooltip &quot;Not usable in Arenas&quot;, tweak it for that and let that be the end of it, rather than possibly considering nerfing it and gimping PvE damage?<br />

Why not? Because they have other specs they can do that do great dps. If the DK tank's spec gets nerfed, he's done as a tank. That player has to reroll for dps, or just stop PvE. (Yes, I understand you might love Destro and hate Demo and Affliction. That's still not quite the same as someone who is there to tank or heal and not to dps at all.)<br />
<br />
Excuse my spelling and punctuation English is not my first language.<br />
<br />
As much as i can understand that conflagrate was a bit too bursty in pvp i must question the logic of the quote above. <br />
I would have thought blizzard would hire more intelligent communicators than this quote suggests.<br />
The arguement is that nerfing conflagrate doesnt hurt pve locks bc they have other greats specs, but the author goes on and argues that Dk tanks only have one tank spec option and therefore a nerf to this would be devastating. Is it me or was it not the purpose that Dk should be viable as tanks in all talent trees? in that case argueing like this is obivously ridiculous. The real comparrison(in simplification) would be to say we nerf conflagrate but you can still do great in pve with demo or affliction compared to Dk tanks it would be something like, we nerf bone armor so you cant tank in unholy but will do fine in frost and blood. <br />
I am not a game designer/developer so bare with me, if you by tank spec mean tank mechanics or something hidden between the lines, but on a strictly rethorical note the author is in trouble. It does not make sense. <br />
<br />
On a slightly different matter i think it is also sign of incredible arrogance to say:<br />
<br />
(Yes, I understand you might love Destro and hate Demo and Affliction. That's still not quite the same as someone who is there to tank or heal and not to dps at all.)<br />
The goal of making all specs viable(not best) is in sharp contrast to this part of the quote. So i understand that nerfing say protection tree for paladins or warriors would be more devastating than destruction for warlocks, but justifying a nerf in destruction with demo and affliction goes against the logic of blizzards own statements from the release of WoTLK. Remember this is again rethorical and destruction warlocks might still be viable, but such an arguement as this should never have been allowed. <br />

Your right! I specced MM to try it out PVP wise, and i ran oom before i could even kill a DK. I respecced to rapid recuperation and efficiency, wich kinda gimped the build i had in mind for pvp :-X. After doing some more PVP i got so frustrated with the gbc the MM build has. Also the MM build has not the same burst as Surv imo. Put Hunters mark, wait 1 sec, put Serpent Sting, wait 1 sec, Put Chimeara shot, wait 1 sec, Put Aimed Shot, wait 1 sec.. i mean comon!<br />
<br />
Am now back as Survival.. at least i can kill something again, shooting things while they explode at the same time :). Bit disapointed at MM though..</div></div><hr />

Don't need to say more than a few words.<br />

What you need to nerf on DKs, hit all 3 specs, no matter what. It's not nerf &quot;blood CDs&quot; or &quot;Unholy CDs&quot;. If they nerf the base skills (so called DKs CDs), they nerf all three tanking specs, making ALL not viable.</div></div><hr />
