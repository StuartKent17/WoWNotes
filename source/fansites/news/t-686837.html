Cataclysm - Screenshot Compilation<br />
I started working on early versions of the Cataclysm zone pages earlier this week and noticed that I never posted a decent compilation of Cataclysm screenshots. I added the name of the zone to each screenshots to make browsing easier.<br />

Gear Requirements for Random Dungeons<br />
The gear requirements are very generous. They are there more to make sure that somebody who has no idea what they are doing (say someone's first character who doesn't even know the dungeon names) doesn't get into one of the harder instances until they have a little more than quest blues.<br />
<br />
If you're sophisticated enough to be posting on these forums, then you're sophisticated enough to know what tanking an Icecrown dungeon requires and whether you're up to the task. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/22048452998-silly-dungeoun-deserter-and-flawed-gear-check.html))<br />

I think Boub meant 25 player mode, not the hard modes of the encounter. I could be wrong though, and I wish I am.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, what's with these? New Troll skins?<br />
<br />
Those are normal trolls with High Warlord gear on...?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm confused as to why two of the screenshots are labeled &quot;Upper Blackrock Spire.&quot; Is the instance getting a visual upgrade, or is that supposed to be Blackrock Descent?<br />
<br />
I believe it may be Blackrock Caverns...although it looks a bit too refined for a hole drilled through the wall.<br />
<br />
1:25PM Deathwing has literally drilled a hole from Blackrock Spire to Grim Batol to transport supplies and troops. This is the Blackrock Caverns. The Twilight Hammer is there, naturally.<br />
<br />
1:24PM Blackrock Caverns is up. &quot;Reinventing a fan favorite.&quot; People love UBRS, but they didn't want to use that as one they made a Heroic for. They are going to recreate the experience.</div></div><hr />

They aren't. Normal Horde Trolls aren't greenish yellow.<br />
<br />
These skins have been in the game for quite a while, but they've never been used... weird.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
99.99% sure that you must clear up to Saurfang, and THEN it breaks into whatever wings you want to do. <br />
<br />
Obviously, now you gotta go through Saurfang and then Plagueworks.<br />
<br />
Once all the wings are released, you'll do Marrowgar -&gt; Deathwhisper -&gt; Gunship -&gt; Saurfang and THEN you can choose any of the wings to do first.</div></div><hr />

I'm a huge explorer/map nerd. I started playing in 2005 and at like lvl30 and I had tried going to see the world tree in Hyjal but it wasn't implimented yet now it will be an actual zone (not an instanced raid) ... I can't wait.

Lol, there's gonna be a lot more than &quot;updated graphics&quot;<br />
Cata will have more than twice as much new raid content at release than WotLK did. PLUS it's completely re-doing the entire 1-60 experience.

Not really trying to rain on anyone's parade here, but WotLK also had 4 raids at launch: Naxx, OS, EoE, and VoA.<br />

<br />
C'mon now, 575 emblems of frost worth mats isn't really &quot;hard&quot; in my book. If you are not really that enthusiastic for the legendary then you might not get it amongst the first on the realm, but after few month, the emblems are going to collect dust anyway as they did now. I'm much more worried bout the drop rate of the other things, like for example Val'anyrs crappy fragment droprate. <br />
<br />
That said, yes, it requires a bit more work as the recent legendary weapons, but it's so much better as Val'anyr was/is. I'd be happy to go through all this hurdle to get a similar quality caster legendary.</div></div><hr />

Still, havent seen anything interesting enough to buy Cataclysm yet.<br />
With the current state of smaller battlegroups in EU and the complete lack of customer support concerning the subject i am not going to stay either. Clarification: After 3.3 the battlegrounds have been completely empty except for WSG and AB. WSG has +30 min waiting line and AB is +30 min to no games at all. Havent played Sota, IoC, AV or Eots in five weeks now. The situation has been bad for four months now and there has been no answers from GM's yet, other than they're monitoring the situation and this was three months ago (No, really. I am not kidding or exaggerating here, to my count three topics filled up with pleas of help or any information about the subject and absolutely no answers).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not only did I write pretty much the same conclusion already in my edit (which you quoted) but also is your example pretty bad - were-wolf is a compound word consisting of were and wolf - whereas were means &quot;man&quot; and wolf means.. well &quot;wolf&quot;. And both words have the same singular/plural forms. There are blueposts quoting &quot;Worgens&quot; which could mean three things... <br />
<br />
1. Worgens is indeed the plural of &quot;Worgen&quot; which is quite unlikely<br />
2. The blueposter/CM doesn't know the plural/that there is no plural and made it up<br />
3. Worgens describes different worgen tribes (as in peoples)<br />
<br />
And while it is not surprising at all it is - at least at this point - interesting enough to think about it and have a discussion though I would recommend to have that in a separate topic if enough people want to discuss it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barreveler</div><div class="date">2010-01-04, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What? 4 of our plate dps mains have 25 and even my DK alt has his 25.<br />
<br />
<br />
And you've spent how much gold? <br />
<br />
I mean, yeah, gold is easier to farm now, but I want to work this out. <br />
<br />
But 3.3 went live on what? December 9th or 10th? Four raid lockouts. <br />
<br />
If you full clear farmed 10 and 25 man each week that's 64 badges. Doing the weekly heroic each week is another 20 badges. Throw in daily random, and you've got another 58 or 60 if you hit it every single day, including release day. <br />
<br />
That's 144 badges thus far, if you were really hardcore about getting everything done. (and yes, if you did both raids, and the weekly heroic, and every single daily random heroic through the holidays, you're playing enough to be considered hardcore). <br />
<br />
That's enough badges for 6 primordial saronite if you bought absolutely nothing else. <br />
<br />
Even supposing you ran all of the above on two toons, that's 12 Primordial Saronite from badges. If you're pretty lucky with drops, you have an additional 8 primordial saronite from drops. That's 20 primordial saronite. Maybe if your guild has enough geared alts to run2 25 mans per week you'll have another 8. <br />
<br />
So even assuming you're your raids &quot;first choice&quot; for the primordial saronite drops, you'd be stretching to have 25 by now from just your raids and your badges. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now that's not saying it's impossible, because of course you can buy them. But on my server they're still in the 3-5 k range, and not a whole lot on the AH at any given time. (and I'm on a high pop server). <br />
<br />
Assuming only one of those &quot;four main dps in your guild and your DK alt&quot; actually got the Saronite drops. The remaining three and one, have at most 12 saronite, more realistically they probably have 8-10 if that. <br />
<br />
If prices are anywhere on your server what they're like on mine, that means you spent somewhere between 39,000 and 65,000 gold to buy an Axe for your DK Alt. <br />
<br />
If you did what I think many more people did and spent those badges on Tier Gear or 264 badge items. (I know I bought a cloak because I had yet to replace my ulduar cloak) You spent 75,000 to 100,000g.</div></div><hr />

I got my last Primordial Saronite this past Friday without spending any money on them.<br />
<br />
Plus my guild has been running 2 ICC25 each week, so they named 2 people that will be collecting Shards. When we start working on hard modes, if both people are in the same raid, the one with the higher shard count will get any that drop that run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
12 Saronite from badges was assuming 2 toons doing all the daily and weekly quests as well as a 10 and 25 each week. <br />
<br />
It's perfectly possible that someone can be doing all of that on more than two toons, but frankly I didn't consider it because that borders on a pretty obsessive amount of time played.</div></div><hr />

The drop rate is 100%. The real question isn't if its a rare drop rate or not, the real question is if multiple people can loot the quest item given that they have the quest.</div></div><hr />

~38k for 20 Saronite. Al'Akir EU is full with a 1k-1.4k queue at prime time since 3.3, so it's no problem to buy them for 1.8-2k each with everyone and their mother running a daily random hc. I am using the badges on my main and DK for set pieces and used a third char to gather enough badges for 5 Saronite. I had 2 weeks off work for the holidays so the timing was quite nice. Now I'm back to only playing 2 chars.<br />
My DK is actually getting the shards from our alt run, so I've spent 38k on a legendary. Big deal, what else should use the gold on?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barreveler</div><div class="date">2010-01-05, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My DK is actually getting the shards from our alt run, so I've spent 38k on a legendary. Big deal, what else should use the gold on?<br />
<br />
<br />
If you actually know you're getting shards that's a little different. 38k would make a hell of a lot less sense if you were doing it for shadows edge and an off chance at completing the shards at some point in the future. <br />
<br />
Then again, I'm still a little bitter about Val'anyr. I (holy pally) was first in line and then had to take a short notice business trip our first week in Ulduar where four shards dropped. With the alternate having a four shard lead the other officers decided he'd get the first one. I started getting them after, but I was at 16 shards when TOC came out and I'm up to 24 now, but now it's hardly even worth trying to get together Uld 25 runs, Trauma would be a fine upgrade at this point.</div></div><hr />

Worg seems to be interchangeable with wolf and-en may well mean man in Common; I don't pretend to know the first thing about how Common actually looks but I'm fairly certain that is what it means. It is probably just coincidence but I always assumed that as tauren and worgen end in -en it denoted being humanoid, so effectively the same as were-.<br />

<br />
&quot;Worgen are large, lupine humanoids reminiscent of a werewolf that walks upright, but lopes on all fours to run. According to sources held by the Forsaken, the worgen come from another dimension, and exist only to terrorize and destroy[...]&quot;<br />
<br />
Yet a bit furhter down the page:<br />
<br />
&quot;The worgen hail from a dark and treacherous world, from which there is no corner which is truly safe. There, the worgen battle their unflinching enemy in a vicious war[...]&quot;<br />
