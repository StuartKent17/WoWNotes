Patch 4.1 Updated TBC Maps<br />
Patch 4.1 will add the last wave of missing dungeon maps to the game by updating all the TBC content! Most TBC 5-man dungeons and raid instances got a shiny new world map.<br />
<br />
The latest PTR build also included the maps of Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub and the updated map for Baradin Hold with a brand new wing/boss! Keep in mind that the next arena season is scheduled for Patch 4.2, you won't see that part of Baradin Hold before a few months. <br />

Which means ya a Dk may be able to solo old things but his skills in a 85 raid are the same as a warrior, pally, or druid. The only diffrence is instead of a shield he uses bubbles and heals which give him better soloing tools.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I need to do some research. I don't know what the Blood Shield + Unholy Presence trick is about. When I solo old content (pre-Wrath raids or Wrath dungeons) I do it in Blood presence. Apparently I am doing it wrong.</div></div><hr />

-0.5sec GSD has much greater impact on your performance than you give credit for.</div></div><hr />

Then healing hell breaks loose and I see some big 30k+ heals (the biggest being 34k I think).<br />
<br />
Can someone explain what's going on there? What's the ability being used? <br />
<br />
Impressive stuff... Can say if DKs are OP, but I know from PvP (and this) that they're tough sons of birches...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inimicus</div><div class="date">2011-03-14, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The big heal spam is Lichborn and Deathcoil IIRC from the spec he posted on the original kill thread. It's pretty easy to bust out heals that big.<br />
<br />
Also, Yogg's fight mechanics with the watchers up really play strongly to the Death Knight ability set, particularly Hodir's save. Get Iceblocked at 1hp for 10 seconds while all your runes reset for double DS spam immediately when you come out + Runetap is pretty massive.<br />
<br />
The nerf to Unholy presence will probably make this impossible until T12 gear closes the dps gap a bit. But generally soloing in Unholy Presence as Blood has been too strong between the combination of Dark Succor, Blood Shield, Increased DPS through the gcd modifier and of course 15% run speed. It should also be noted that Mionelol is wearing absolutely top of the line pve gear right now and it's unlikely many players (like 10 or 15 worldwide?) have the gear and skill to pull that kill off. Big grats to him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashareth</div><div class="date">2011-03-14, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to do some research. I don't know what the Blood Shield + Unholy Presence trick is about. When I solo old content (pre-Wrath raids or Wrath dungeons) I do it in Blood presence. Apparently I am doing it wrong.<br />
<br />
Easyly explained.<br />
<br />
When you use Blood Presence, your Death Strikes heals for 15% of incoming damage for last 5s or 7% of max health. With a little more armor and life from Blood presence.<br />
In Unholy presence, you get faster Rune Regen, faster GCD, run speed, and, using the Glyph of Dark Succor, DS that heal for 15% max health or more, wich is a MAJOR boost to survivability AND dps all around.<br />
<br />
Specially on content where you won't have often 15% of the incoming damage for 5s &gt; 15% max health because it would mean taking your whole life pool in damage over 5s to get the same amount of heal, and since the Blood Shield amount depends on the amount healed, that glyph makes it insanely big. :D<br />
<br />
It's the same reason that makes Blood DK quite painful in pvp when you don't have peeps to cc/burn them fast, they can heal a lot in a small timeframe.<br />
(btw the nerf is mostly there for pvp and bg in particular, not old content, but it will affect it too).<br />
<br />
At the moment, someone running non-trivial old content in Blood Spec/Blood Presence and without the Dark Succor glyph is doing it dead wrong honestly, it's too good to pass (hell, nearly twice as much hps from DS, and the faster rune and gcd regen on top of it, meaning more DS and damage/shield :p).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That being said, when I saw this video last week I decided to try it using a Raid Lockout from an achievement run with friends. I'm 359-372 geared in every slot and after 2 and a half hours of getting my ass handed to me, I gave up.<br />
<br />
Major props to this guy. This was no easy feat. Gear played a very small role - it comes down to RNG, RNG and more RNG. The dedication is admirable. Congrats on the kill!</div></div><hr />

Hunters have killed pretty much as many bosses from old raids as DK (some before dk managed to do it, and in far lesser gear), and nobody complains about it.<br />
Same with Prot Paladins too, and no one complains either.<br />
<br />
Once again, like in Wrath, old content soloing won't get DK nerfed, nor will Bliz stop balancing classes at 85, making some classes/specs broken till 75+, so stop bringing it up.</div></div><hr />

This DK soloing Yogg is a perfect example of how unbalanced pvp is atm... Reason being although there are no stun mechanics in Yogg I really don't think an 85 player could output as much damage as yogg to a DK in full vicious... even with stuns I really doubt a DK could be nuked if they had a healer and/or were blood. So imagine how little damage I would do in a heals dps 2v2 combo against a blood DK and a healer.... Yeh good luck...<br />

Well well well, someone didnt swallowed his pill of hapiness this morning, heh ?<br />
<br />
What you say doesnt make a lot of sense. Sure, a blood DK + a healer is difficult to kill but it shouldnt kill you either. Blood DK is a tank, and a tank gets a lot of damage from PVE incoming damage, AKA Vengeance. This Dk soloing Yogg does massive damage because he receives a lot. In a PvP situation, this DK would do less that half of the number you see on this vid, except for the occasional burst he may get from using CD's. <br />
<br />
How many Blood DK / Healer comp are they in top 2v2 arena team ? Yeah thats right, not a lot.<br />
5% in 2v2<br />
3% in 3v3<br />
Less that 1% in 5v5.<br />
<br />
So if you want to whine, do it right, and about the right things. Not about Blood DK in PvP because this is an abysmal issue.</div></div><hr />

Counterspell is off the GCD but does trigger GCD, so you can't continue uninterrupted with your rotation / priority system if you use Counterspell. The fact that it's off the gcd means that it can actually interrupt your rotation/priority system more severely if you need to /stopcasting /cast Counterspell for an emergency interrupt. <br />
<br />
The details aren't really the point. Daily Blink was funny. They could have chosen any class and it still would be funny. :P</div></div><hr />

Last time I checked, it does not trigger your GCD.</div></div><hr />

godamnit people, stop using crappy music for your wow videos, chances are you're locking 25% of your interested viewers out.<br />
Also, chances are many rap fan viewers don't like black metal, many metal fan viewers don't like dubstep and many techno fan viewers don't like gangsta rap, so what's the point ?<br />
<br />
there also must be an option to mark the music from your clip eventually as copyrighted, sometimes I can watch a video and &quot;only&quot; get the audio disabled...<br />

<br />
Anything can be solo'd with enough extra levels and gear if the mechanics don't make it bug out. First boss in BWL for example will never work with less than 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a few things that will make the fight easier. <br />
<br />
1. HAS to done before 4.1 (the UH pres. blood spec big shields/heals won't happen after 4.1)<br />
2. The Valkyrs will not attack a tank, so soloing won't have to worry.<br />
3. Due to the massive shields you should get in ICC, Defile shouldn't matter either.</div></div><hr />

It seems Dk's are allways the first ones to solo stuff, both expansions. Just goes to show how unbalanced their tools are : /</div></div><hr />

<br />
Defile ticks for 25k per seconds if it reaches maximum size : yes, it will matter.<br />
Unless you meant INFEST, in that case you are right, it should be doable. But Defile no, you have to get out of these !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reapermd</div><div class="date">2011-03-14, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted on the second page but apparently quite a few of you are just annoying as hell. Everyone that is complaining about DK to op, or nerf dk's, or my favorite who ever it was that went into a rant about pvp need to shut up. First off the Death Knight in the video is in BiS 85 gear and is extremely good at this game. They also spent multipliable hours trying this fight which means rng played a big part in the fight. <br />
First of the op argument, the game is balanced around 85 content nothing else. That being said this probably won't be possible next patch as blizzard is removing the blood shield from death strike unless you are in blood presence. This means when soloing things the Death Knight can still get bigger heals in unholy or frost presence if they are glyphed but they will no longer get a shield protecting them from hits. Which also means they can be crit unlike when in blood. <br />
And the whole pvp thing, if you ever get beat in arena by a blood DK and a healer you should quite wow. I mean blood DK's do like no damage if you actually have gear yea he would take forever to kill if you are dumb enough to focus him. Focus down the healer and keep the Dk CC or kite him cause he can't do anything at range worth worrying about.</div></div><hr />
