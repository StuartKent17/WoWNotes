Patch 4.3.2 Going Live This Week<br />
The information isn't official but assuming everything goes as planned, Patch 4.3.2 should be going live this week. It's not like it can go wrong 2 weeks in a row, right? <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/january/patchtime_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/january/patchtime.jpg)<br />
<br />
This patch is bringing us Cross Realm raids for older content with RealID friends, a few item tweaks and new items, a few new achievements, and a reduced game client install size. It's also bringing the 64 bit client to the game, even if it won't be directly included in the game client it will be available as a separate download after the release of the patch. <br />
<br />
And yes, there's technically a 0.5% chance that something can go wrong. Just like last week the patch is scheduled for deployment internally, the patch files are already available on Blizzard's patch servers, and everything points to a release this week. It doesn't mean that things can't go wrong like last week, and this is exactly why Blizzard doesn't announce patches early and this is exactly why I looked like a big-ass idiot (http://xkcd.com/37/) last tuesday. <br />
<br />
Cross Realm Raids<br />
We previously introduced the ability to form cross-realm parties with Real ID friends (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/190952-new-real-id-party-feature-now-live/), and now with Patch 4.3.2, we're adding the ability for players to use that same functionality to form raids to run older normal or heroic raids, or participate in Battlegrounds!<br />
<br />
This will allow you to join up with your Real ID friends (http://us.battle.net/en/realid/) from other realms and:<br />
<br />
Form a cross-realm raid and use Raid Finder<br />
Jump in to any classic dungeon or raid and be automatically placed in the same instance<br />
Join forces and dominate the Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
<br />
Please note, you will not yet be able to run normal or Heroic Dragon Soul with cross-realm Real ID raids.<br />
<br />
As we look forward to the BattleTag system (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/209494-introducing-battletag/), it’s a very exciting time for World of Warcraft. No matter what realm you and your friends are on you’ll be able to team up and take on group content throughout the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dragon Soul Difficulty Changes<br />
During the scheduled server maintenance on the week of January 31, the Dragon Soul raid will become enveloped by the “Power of the Aspects” spell, reducing the health and damage dealt of all enemies in the raid by 5%. This spell will grow progressively stronger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/109257/power-of-the-aspects/) over time to reduce the difficulty and make the encounters more accessible. The spell will affect both normal and Heroic difficulties, but it will not affect the Looking for Raid difficulty.<br />
<br />
The spell can also be disabled by talking to Lord Afrasastrasz at the beginning of Dragon Soul, if a raid wishes to attempt the encounters without the aid of the Dragon Aspects.<br />
<br />
For those of you who raided in Firelands and/or Icecrown you’re no doubt aware that as time goes on we want to keep people progressing by adjusting the difficulty. For any number of reasons a group may be having difficulty on a specific encounter each week, and our intent in adjusting the content is to ensure the ability to keep progressing, enjoying the content, and gearing up. With Icecrown we progressively buffed the players, and while this slow progression (and ability to opt-out of the buff) were both beneficial, it led to an expectation of your characters power, and once you left the raid you could certainly feel less effective. For Firelands we attempted to fix that by nerfing the content instead of buffing players, but we nerfed the content difficulty all at one time, which was counterproductive for players who really didn’t need as severe a change as we made. With Dragon Soul we’re attempting to do the best of both by having a progressive nerf to the content, keeping player power constant while providing small increases in assistance over a long period of time, as well as allowing players to opt-out of the assistance by speaking to Lord Afrasastrasz.<br />
<br />
We hope you continue to enjoy Dragon Soul, and that these changes encourage you to attempt a higher difficulty, or just keep pushing to down that next boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
4.3.2 PTR and New File Optimization Tech<br />
With the 4.3.2 patch we’ll be testing some new file optimization tech. As you may be aware, with previous major expansion patches (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, etc.) we’ve carried out a time-consuming process to reorganize the game files currently installed on your hard drive to integrate all previous patch files, essentially ‘cleaning up’ what’s on your computer and reducing the full installation size. This process used to require an amount of free hard drive space double that of the entire installation size to complete, which is why we’ve reserved them for large expansion-sized patches.<br />
<br />
The new tech we’re testing with the 4.3.2 PTR will process these cleanups with no additional hard drive space required beyond what the patch is adding. Because of that you may see them appear more frequently with patches.<br />
<br />
While the cleanup is occurring you’ll see a specific message on the launcher informing you the process is currently taking place. If you encounter any issues with the new process please be sure to visit our support site at http://www.battle.net/support/<br />

Items<br />
<br />
Vial of Shadows (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/77207/vial-of-shadows/) had the proc damage cut in third and proc frequency tripled to reduce burst in PvP.<br />
Many of the original level 60 ranked PvP gear items have had Replica added to the start of their name, making their name identical to the versions being sold in Area 52, for example the Replica High Warlord's Cleaver (http://db.mmo-champion.com/item/77580/#15050/15148). However, they still retain their higher item level and stats.<br />
Gurthalak, Voice of the Deeps (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/78487/gurthalak-voice-of-the-deeps/) had its proc time increased to 12 seconds from 10 seconds. This change was made to all three versions of the item.<br />
The three new items added in Patch 4.3.2 are found on the TCG Loot vendor in Booty Bay. They are part of the Timewalkers: War of the Ancients expansion. (Feldrake (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79771/feldrake/), Eye of the Legion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79744/eye-of-the-legion/), and Demon Hunter's Aspect (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79769/demon-hunters-aspect/))<br />

Hey, I had quit WoW for 9 months but still came by MMO-C to keep up on what was going on in the WoWlands.<br />
<br />
Kinda like how if someone moved from Russia to Canada, they'd still probably try to keep up on what's going on in the motherland despite being incredibly happier about where they are now than where they used to be.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't help for Warriors and Paladins, in which their DPS specs (Arms, Fury, and Retribution) are utter rubbish to the point that the Protection specs simply do more damage. It's not as much as a problem if you're Arms, but if you're the other two, you're fucked.<br />

This could be seen as a nerf or w/e u wanna call it. the dmg could be spread between 12 sec and lowering the dps. But this wouldnt actually matter that much anyway i think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This still won't affect the blue crystal at all, with the increased cost it will probably be somewhere close to 2500 mana per HR (during blue). With decent gear and cooldown management, you can easily spam HR.<br />
As for the 4 set bonus nerf, that has been in-game for a long time.<br />
<br />
The new mana change is just going to make it so we spam 1 HR less out of 5 casts. Or better cooldown management. With full 397 and some HC pieces, it won't affect me much so the change isn't all too damaging where the extra healing is needed.</div></div><hr />

Available 5.1GB Playable 1.2GB<br />

if it is a download they release later remember to copy your wow interface folder somewhere else on your computer don't rename it just copy it, most know this but still thought i would remind people.<br />
Honestly people should do this before patching just to be safe.</div></div><hr />

right click on your warcraft shortcut &gt; click open file location &gt; open Blizzard Updater. That sometimes fixes the issue.<br />
You could also try going into the options on the front of the client an turning off peer to peer downloading<br />
<br />
Two things i have heard may fix that issue</div></div><hr />

I appreciate the advice. Sadly, I had already tried both of these, and no dice. It looks like it actually already downloaded the patch, and it's just not updating for some reason.</div></div><hr />

I think the so called &quot;optimization&quot; is WAY bigger than they make it look. They might have changed A LOT the way the game deal with cache and MPQ files.</div></div><hr />

If you find someone you like on another server just tag them, without having to share your real email with strangers, which means mail spam incoming.

while thats true, the 5% stacking nerf would of solved it, without nerfing it to the ground, that and how easy madness is, the number of guilds on 7/7 heroic should rocket up, hopefuly we have something todo soon (like 5.0 beta heh)</div></div><hr />

Can you turn that off also or is there now another excuse to nerf hardmodes while there are two easier difficulties that you can do?<br />
<br />
Oh wait it's because guilds can now use varied raidcompositions! Because that is more important than having a challenge in hardmodes.</div></div><hr />

Maybe I misunderstood you, but if Raids wanted to have a challenge, they would not have excluded several specs in the first place, I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: Not bad. Only had to d/l like 40Mb. And it freed up 7Gb.</div></div><hr />

We are working on getting the new 64 bit client released to you as soon as possible and are finishing up some last minute preparations. At the moment, if you have downloaded the 64 bit client, please do not use it as you will be unable to log in unless you use the 32 bit version. We will update here as soon as we have any news or updates regarding this client. From 1 hour ago. Blue post.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">St8kout</div><div class="date">2012-02-01, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just installed it and so far it works great. <br />
<br />
I did have one problem where only my basic mouse buttons were working on my WoW mouse. Fixed it by unchecking &quot;Detect WoW mouse&quot; then apply, then checking it again and applying again. Works fine now.<br />
<br />
It will reset your resolution to 600 by 800, so just put it back where it needs to be for your monitor, and uncheck 'Vertical Sync&quot; for faster frame rates.<br />
<br />
To install, download the zip file, extract it into your WoW folder, (it's in your Program Files), and you are good to go. Just click on your regular WoW Launcher.<br />
<br />
After installing it, you can switch back and forth from 64 to 32 from the Launcher under 'Game Pref.' Look for the check or uncheck box &quot;Run in 32 bit mode.&quot; Easy peasy.</div></div><hr />
