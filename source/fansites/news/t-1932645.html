Legion - Thrall and Doomhammer<br />
We found some interesting references to Thrall and Doomhammer. Unfortunately there isn't much more than what is below yet. Keep in mind that this is just a reference in an alpha build of Legion, not something final or officially announced. Spoilers below!<br />
<br />
Keep your eyes on Thrall. He's wounded. He's like to kill himself down here and I don't want to be the one to tell his wife!<br />
Doomhammer... it was like a dead weight in my hands. The elements were silent. It has been this way since I used it to slay Garrosh.<br />
<br />
Spirits... hear my call... <br />
Are you the so-called &quot;World Shaman?&quot; Hah! You fight like a crippled pig. <br />
<br />
Hear me, elements of Azeroth.<br />
Once, we walked as one. I abused your powers for my own personal vendetta.<br />
Take back the Doomhammer! Grant it to one who is worthy.<br />
Teach me, and again I will be your servant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion - Shaman Artifact Intro<br />
A little piece of the Shaman Artifact intro was also found, likely from the ending that takes place in your Class Hall.<br />
We stand at the precipice of oblivion, but we do not stand alone. Come forward, shaman. <br />
Take your place among the circle, Farseer. The Earthen Ring is forged anew, and with it, we rekindle hope for this world. <br />
You are the chosen defender of Azeroth! May your wisdom guide this circle to victory, and may the power of your artifact crush those who would bring chaos to this land.<br />
<br />
The elements have chosen you as their champion, $n. The artifact you wield is proof.<br />
It is your destiny to lead the Earthen Ring against the Burning Legion. We need you. Do you accept this burden? <br />
Yes. I will be your Farseer!<br />
<br />
From this map you may dispatch members of the Earthen Ring throughout the Broken Isles. Lead us to victory, Farseer!<br />
This Astral Portal will return you to Dalaran whenever you wish, Farseer. I will keep it open so that you may return here any time.<br />
<br />

Legion - Artifact Weapon Previews<br />
Today we have the Elemental Shaman Artifact The Fist of Ra-Den (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/128935-the-fist-of-ra-den). Several of the shields are missing still, so look for them after a new build.<br />

How is Cheap Shot part of a rotation, surely its only a utility, stun button?<br />
For CC purposes, it can be used as on a rotational basis. Itâ€™s not maximum DPS, but still commonly worth it for things like PvP. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/684558938440769536))<br />
<br />
Wtf do you mean blind is gone? Why?? It's my fave Cc! It feels so cocky just to blind a mob. Like &quot;No! Wait your turn!&quot; :'(<br />
That was referring to Subtlety specifically. Different Rogue specs have different ways to CC. For example, you may like Parley. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/684575905650356224))<br />
<br />
Legion Shadow Dance is a letdown to some pvpers. Maybe let an active/passive effect? Passive is negated while on CD, thoughts?<br />
I'd love to hear more about this feedback. People giving it: What frequency are you imagining for the proposed version? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/684792547005210624))<br />
No sane PvP'er wants to lose the ability to make plays like we can with Shadow Dance. Its just a bad idea.<br />
Again, that's why I'm asking these questions. How are you imagining it will play out? There's clearly a difference. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/684798237060927488))<br />
The downside is not being able to do stuff on-demand, and positioning not mattering due to Shadowstrike.<br />
So you're saying that you don't expect the proposed version will feel controllable? That's useful feedback. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/684800991980421120))<br />

If there are no weapon drops in Legion, where will a enhancement shaman get his off hand weapon from?<br />
Doomhammer grants shamans the power to form a second weapon from the elements! No need for any lesser weapon drops. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/684534476722982913))<br />
Is it like a copy of Doomhammer or something else?<br />
Here's an image of it next to Doomhammer! It's also on the Artifact blog here: https://t.co/BJoTNPPtwq (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/684538566978846720))<br />

Thrall has *nothing* to be sorry for. Garrosh was a warmongering douche bag and he had to be taken out. If anything, Thrall should feel bad for not killing him during WoTLK when it was blatantly obvious who/what he was.<br />

The elements should abandon him for letting Garrosh corrupt them while he was at home smoking weed and making baby Thralls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah. The elements aren't there to be used to tip the scales in your favour in a blood feud; that's why they're banned from Mak'Gora, it's out of respect to the elements. Thrall may have been justified in killing Garrosh, and Garrosh may have needed to be killed, but this was for political reasons not spiritual ones. I hate Garrosh and consider him a cowardly wimp and pitiful leader but he did nothing to upset the natural order. He may have offended the elemental spirits on every level but they did not ordain his murder. That was a mortal conflict.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More than likely exactly this. Instead of using his own power to kill Garrosh and settle his own dispute, he ended up dragging the elements into things, which I don't think they appreciated one bit.<br />
<br />
The confusing part is, why are the elements pissed with Thrall when he used the Furies' powers? Perhaps the elements transcend across the cosmos and just take on different forms on different planets?</div></div><hr />

But I'm curious... he killed Garrosh on Draenor not Azeroth... why would the elements of Azeroth be angry with him?<br />
<br />
Why would either worlds' elements be angry at him at all? Garrosh has a body-count probably nearing the millions and has fucked up every ecosystem his Horde came into contact with.<br />
<br />
That's like being mad at someone for assassinating Hitler.</div></div><hr />

He has been the reason for the major problems in the past recent xpacs. Puts Garrosh in charge, turns Azeroth into the next level of war between Alliance and Horde. A new piece of land is found and Garrosh wants to strip it all down of its resources and artifacts to strengthen the Horde and we leave it with a crater and sha-touched in one of the most sacred parts of the land. And finally he ran off to Marty McFly the shit out of Draenor, which causes many of our planets heros to die. Finally, Gul'dan now has a vendetta with us so make that a 4th xpac Thrall should be responsible for. If you think about who was really worse, Garrosh who was a warmongering psycho or Thrall who sat back and did nothing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed,<br />
<br />
Also wouldn't it just be the elements of Draenor, Azeroth elements still think he's Jesus Thrall saving the world. Unless I guess someone brought in some Draenor elements into Azeroth and they are corrupting or influencing the Azeroth elements in some way.</div></div><hr />

That is after all why Thrall could not threaten him in Orgrimmar. I thought it was poetic justice that Garrosh forgot or dismissed why he was able to have the upper hand in the first place.<br />
<br />
It's also possible that Thrall just doesn't believe in the mak'gora anymore. He has after all brought a lot of change to the orcs. Perhaps he was fed up with how the past kept creating people like Garrosh just through such rigidity. Also, I can't believe I'm defending Thrall... but I just feel like there is too much &quot;We wanted the weapon duel!&quot; without looking at the other end.</div></div><hr />

The person who had an entire expac of focus as the &quot;savior&quot; of azeroth. Meanwhile, we're killing off vol'jin who hasn't even warmed up the throne, let alone recieved any character development past what he had before he took the throne. They're killing off Varian, who seems like his story could go a lot further. They've pumped so much story into him that killing him now seems like a complete waste. <br />
<br />
IMO It should've been Tirion and Thrall. They both had their expansions, they both resolved all their stories.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin isn't dieing, if anything he fakes his dead &amp; looks up the Zandalari to help with the fight against the Legion.</div></div><hr />

He has been the reason for the major problems in the past recent xpacs. Puts Garrosh in charge, turns Azeroth into the next level of war between Alliance and Horde. A new piece of land is found and Garrosh wants to strip it all down of its resources and artifacts to strengthen the Horde and we leave it with a crater and sha-touched in one of the most sacred parts of the land. And finally he ran off to Marty McFly the shit out of Draenor, which causes many of our planets heros to die. Finally, Gul'dan now has a vendetta with us so make that a 4th xpac Thrall should be responsible for. If you think about who was really worse, Garrosh who was a warmongering psycho or Thrall who sat back and did nothing?<br />

Voljin and varian are not going to die for real i think they are just missed and believed dead.</div></div><hr />

Elements are mercurial. They don't remember past glories. They know what you did now - and Thrall violated that.<br />

<br />
Initially a warrior's weapon, wielded by the strongest shaman for years, therefore being empowered, the same way Ashbringer became what it is due to those wielding it.<br />
An enhancement shaman is precicely a mix of a fighter and shaman.<br />
<br />
You could say Thrall slowly attuned the weapon to the elements over the years, but then lost the connection with the elements, and hands it down to someone else with a deep connection to both the elements and fighting (enhancement).</div></div><hr />

Cmon, hes done. Just let him go Blizzard.<br />
You killed off Varian, the face of the Alliance with ease. No problem with that I bet.<br />
And you even killed off Vol'jin, who only JUST started being the leader of the Horde, making a big storyline of him growing into a leader in MoP, with so much potential to see him as a leader during this war... but no...you just kill him off for alittle bit of old &quot;Alliance vs Horde&quot; tension... :mad:</div></div><hr />

When Thrall gets in trouble, it's never because he doesn't have enough power or is caught by surprise, it's because the elements abandoned him somehow (Garrosh with his &quot;My dark shaman have tortured the elements miles around!&quot;-rant, how do you torture the elements?

Just....awful writing. Doesn't bode well for the lore of this expac :(<br />
<br />
Dude, World of Warcraft is the culmination of Metzen's egomaniacle Orc boner... The story in this game has been terrible since TBC.<br />
<br />
I mean, which expansion HASN'T the Orc race been a key? Which expansion have we seen Gnomes and Tauren get the spotlight? How many stories have been butchered, abandoned and spit-on since the end of VANILLA?<br />
<br />
The only reason ANYONE plays this game anymore is the carrot-on-a-stick mentality that's kept it alive for the past decade. Gotta keep churning out rigged PVP, uninteresting quests and dailies, and garbage raids.<br />
<br />
The only OTHER reason anyone plays this game is for the CHANCE at some decent role playing, which has been pretty much ignored by Blizzard, and the rest of the MMO industry, for the past 11 years.<br />
<br />
I would only like to return to WoW because Legion has a CHANCE at being decent but it's a very small, meagre, nigh-hopeless chance at that. You'll always get fanboys who would suck Metzen's dick if he told them to, but for those of us who care about quality, WoW has really entered it's twilight year. The saddest part is, Blizz has the resources and potential to devote the next 5 years to REALLY building a new MMO franchise, something sci-fi and epic with real story, content and continuity but they won't because they've branched out into too many other cash cows. Starcraft 2 is over after LotV, Overwatch is just their attempt at getting a piece of that genre's pie, Hearthstone is just another rigged social game and Diablo 3 suffered from bad story as well.<br />
<br />
If I could work my will on the world, 80% of Blizz's wealth would be taken away and given to charity and the remaining 20% would be devoted to making a GOOD game.</div></div><hr />

I mean, which expansion HASN'T the Orc race been a key? Which expansion have we seen Gnomes and Tauren get the spotlight? How many stories have been butchered, abandoned and spit-on since the end of VANILLA?<br />
<br />
The only reason ANYONE plays this game anymore is the carrot-on-a-stick mentality that's kept it alive for the past decade. Gotta keep churning out rigged PVP, uninteresting quests and dailies, and garbage raids.<br />
<br />
The only OTHER reason anyone plays this game is for the CHANCE at some decent role playing, which has been pretty much ignored by Blizzard, and the rest of the MMO industry, for the past 11 years.<br />

Blizzard has said and most of us agree that WoW is on uncharted waters in lore, is way far in the timeline since warcraft 1-2-3 etc and of course the plot doesn't necessarily goes as we all hope or think is right.<br />
However i agree with you about their wealth and how much of it is used for lore and wow development. No i dont want any new futurustic crap, we have shitloads of failed attempts there worldwide. I want WoW 2!<br />
For my part i am afraid Legion will be the first time SINCE TBC (was resto at vanilla ..) that i might even stop playing my enhancement shaman. Changing the playstyle and making it energy resource management like Demon Hunters, for me is like they are saying, we are making your tombstone that we started since WoD day 1, we didn't like that you ruled at Throne of Thunder, time to delete you completely. If you see ranks of archimonde mythic kills, i dont see more than 300enha shamans about logging stats..<br />
There won't be decent role playing, unless you think that drama is decent role playing. Decent role playing as an idea must contain characters that develop their personalities (or destroy them) during the course of the game. If they kill outright npcs like voljin and varian and thrall going emo...then what to expect for the rest?<br />
<br />
And please dont insult players who play this game since vanilla (you joined here 2014..?) because through this game at least we met friends and lost friends and had fun times. If you were antisocial and just wanted to play an awesome game..there are many single player ones...<br />
Also i disagree with you about the quests and the garbage raids. Raids have become increasingly difficult the last years, at least on the high end (heroic then mythic) level. I really enjoyed most of the quests on my alts (well my main had to power lvl up through the quests no time to read).</div></div><hr />

In order for any shaman to even use the elements he/her needs to pretty much ask for permission to aid him/her. So pretty much Thrall was given permission to kill Garrosh with the power of them.....which means why would they be pissed at him for giving him the ability to do so.</div></div><hr />

While agree with you in spirit in parts, the story was pretty good in Cata, just poorly told. Wrath had a GREAT story in the leveling portion. MoP was very solid writing, even great at parts. WoD is where the wheels fell off, and that's the first expansion Metzen didn't have a day to day role - it was all Dave Kosak. I think he's the driving force behind the piss poor writing being done now, like the incredibly stupid and disappointing end to Hellfire, or the hints at a great backstory for Yrel, which never happened, or the &quot;important paladin story&quot; that never appeared. <br />
<br />
But yeah, not interested in all in &quot;orc redemption&quot; and them being the focus for so long. Sylvanas has the most compelling story of all, and she's been ignored since Cata. Jana was just getting interesting, and she's sidelined. Gnomes have been ignored since Wrath. Goblins have been ignored since Cata. Worgen...the poor Worgen...it's the World Of Wasted Opportunity.</div></div><hr />

Come on. I want me instant lightning bolt! I stopped playing elemental because casting on the move was removed for lightning bolt, severely crippling elemental freedom of movement (which was SO fun!). Switched to hunter, because they do have almost full freedom of movement AND disengage. Now if we get insta-lightning bolt, I will surely move back to elemental. I'll take the crappy 'rage' mechanics for granted for increased freedom of movement. Spreading flameshocks will still suck if they take up full resources. Just make flameshock 20-30sec DOT baseline and let us spread it instantly, reduce the ticking damage a bit to make up for not having a cooldown if you feel that's neccesary, but don't make it crappy using up full resources, making it a pain to spread.</div></div><hr />

When did he kill Azuregos?</div></div><hr />
