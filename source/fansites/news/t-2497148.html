The Operation: Mechagon mega dungeon has been out for almost a week now and players have discovered that there is a way to activate a hard mode of the dungeon that provides much more of a challenge, but also greater rewards upon completion!<br />
<br />
<br />
The HK-8 Aerial Oppression Unit (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/150190-hk-8-aerial-oppression-unit) hovers over one of the first three bosses when you enter the dungeon. Normally, you would head to whatever boss doesn't have the HK-8 Aerial Oppression Unit (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/150190-hk-8-aerial-oppression-unit) over it, but for hard mode you must defeat each of the first three bosses while HK-8 Aerial Oppression Unit (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/150190-hk-8-aerial-oppression-unit) is over it!<br />
<br />
This causes you to have to deal with Walkie Shockie X1 (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/152703-walkie-shockie-x1) robots during the fight, which are immune to damage (but not crowd control) and slowly follow random players while using Static Discharge (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/296518-static-discharge). Upon reaching full energy they will self destruct.<br />
<br />
Upon defeating the first three bosses while HK-8 Aerial Oppression Unit (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/150190-hk-8-aerial-oppression-unit) is above them, you will head to fight the aerial unit. This fight will replace the normal Tank Buster MK1 (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/150295-tank-buster-mk1) robot with a Tank Buster MK2 (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/155760-tank-buster-mk2), a harder hitting mob that also uses a move called Fulminating Burst (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/303885-fulminating-burst), which adds a stacking mechanic throughout the fight.<br />
<br />
The Walkie Shockie X1 (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/152703-walkie-shockie-x1) robots you dealt with in the first three bosses return in this fight as Walkie Shockie X2 (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/155645-walkie-shockie-x2) robots, which function the same but also have beams that connect between them which hurt when walked through.<br />
The final change is reduced time to complete the hack in phase 2.<br />
<br />
After defeating HK-8 Aerial Oppression Unit (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/150190-hk-8-aerial-oppression-unit) you can continue the dungeon until you get to K.U.-J.0.<br />
<br />
There will be a clickable pile of robo-waste on the ground that you must click before engaging the boss.<br />
The only change to this fight is the addition of Noxious Stench (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/301850-noxious-stench), which adds a stacking slow.<br />
<br />
The final part of hard mode involves the fight with King Mechagon (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/150397-king-mechagon).<br />
<br />
There will be a small red button on a pedestal that must be clicked before the encounter.<br />
Clicking the button will add a robot to the fight that does nothing but deplete its own energy bar over the course of the fight from 100 to 0. Upon reaching 0 energy, the party will instantly wipe.<br />
<br />
To counter this, there are 4 panels around the room that will activate when the robot reaches 35 energy, roughly every 45 seconds.<br />
<br />
These panels will all display a color and icon in a random order before flashing a red skull and activating an input sequence just before the final 10 energy countdown.<br />
4 members of the group must each stand at one of these panels just before the input sequence and click them in the correct order that they lit up in to bring the robot's energy back to 100 and start the process over until the boss is defeated.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Completing Operation: Mechagon on Hard mode rewards the following:<br />
<br />
The Keep DPS-ing and Nobody Explodes (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13624-keep-dps-ing-and-nobody-explodes) achievement.<br />
<br />
Completing Hard mode without anyone in the group dying the whole run will also give you the Hertz Locker (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13789-hertz-locker) achievement and Rank 4 of your Vision of Perfection (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/299368-vision-of-perfection) essence, the lower ranks of which are initially aquired by defeating King Mechagon on a normal run.<br />
<br />
Aerial Unit R-21/X (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168830-aerial-unit-r-21-x) - Rewarded to a random player in the group.<br />
An item level 430 Azerite Armor helm slot item rewarded to a random player in the group.<br />

Patch 8.2 - Fun Flavor Text<br />
Players have also randomly discovered that certain characters in 8.2 will react to your character in specific ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
A Restoration Shaman with their weapon transmogged into Sharas'dal, Scepter of Tides (https://www.wowdb.com/items/128911-sharasdal-scepter-of-tides) will have Azshara whisper them during the Eternal Palace raid.<br />
<br />
Queen Azshara whispers: Is that Sharas'dal you hold? Impudent mortal! You dare to wield my own scepter against me?!<br />
<br />
Bondo Bigblock in Mechagon will shout the following if you fly into Bondo's Yard riding Invincible's Reins (https://www.wowdb.com/items/50818-invincibles-reins):<br />
<br />
Bondo Bigblock yells: We got a visitor! Look at you riding around on your dead pony. What, you can't find a live one?<br />

I agree. it's not like they have been doing this with mounts since at least Wrath. Just for them to change this out of the blue is another step too far.</div></div><hr />

Correct, the Mechagon Peacekeeper (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168826-mechagon-peacekeeper) can drop from the aerial unit 4th boss though regardless of difficulty</div></div><hr />

Wait...the only way to get Mimiron's Head is to do Yogg on hard mode? Yes, challenging content is more rewarding. This isn't new. If you really want this mount there is a recolor someone posted in this thread.</div></div><hr />

Another question might be if someone finishes the dungeon on normal mode, then does it again on hard mode. Would they be eligible for the hard mode loot?</div></div><hr />

Probably not as loot on mythic is tied to a weekly lockout. Safest bet they should wait till weekly reset and start fresh just to be sure.<br />
<br />
As for continuation of kujo you maybe still be able to complete it on hard mode as long as you followed the criteria post above.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The mount from King Mechagon is basically the mount from Nightbane in return to Kara, both require hard mode to get. <br />
<br />
The mount off the 4th boss is the same as the one from Huntsman, i.e. it is a random drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This Dungeon is a DPS check for the Raid. If you couldn't beat a single boss two things happen. <br />
<br />
1. Your team needs to learn that mechanics matter.<br />
2. Your team's overall dps is too low.</div></div><hr />

Yeah well none of us are any of those things. None touch Mythics of any kind and top out at Normal in raids. Myself, I only do LFR. I'll probably wait until they make Mech Heroic and in Group Finder which will happen eventually like it did with the other dungeons that started out as Mythic only.<br />

They have already nerfed many of the trash mobs as of today.</div></div><hr />
