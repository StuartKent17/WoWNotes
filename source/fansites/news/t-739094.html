Guild Talents were removed a while back and replaced with Guild Perks. <br />
<br />
Reminder from the Cataclysm Press Tour (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1790-World-of-Warcraft-Cataclysm-Press-Tour)<br />
There are 25 guild levels and each level will automatically reward with an extra perk. The leveling process remains unchanged and your guild will gain experience through PvP, Dungeon and Raid progression, questing, etc ...<br />
<br />
Guild currency has also been removed and rewards will just be &quot;unlocked&quot; after you reach a specific level or complete a guild achievement. Once a reward is unlocked, members will be able to purchase it with gold. Some of the rewards include guild tabards, mounts, heirlooms, and it looks like you will finally be able to have a guild tabard on your mount. (Just like the Argent Tournament banners)<br />
<br />
New members of a guild won't be able to buy everything directly, they will have to contribute to the progression of the guild before they can access the top rewards. Each time a player helps towards the leveling he will gain reputation with the guild, the best rewards will require players to be exalted with their guild before they can buy it. <br />

my fish feast buff that i will lose within 15 minutes on a progress night will last 90/120 minutes instead of 60<br />
but i guess it has its ups and downs, the rest of the talents looks pretty good<br />

Lock summon is still good for when you have to go back to dal for something. Flasks, repug.<br />
<br />
Mass summon is on a 2 hour CD. Lock summon is a few minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Guild perks look nice. Kinda want some more info on how the guild rep works. Do we all start at neutral on cata launch or what?<br />
<br />
What actually levels it and by how much?<br />
<br />
Also wouldn't mind getting a look at some of the Guild achievements/FOS <br />
<br />
http://cata.wowhead.com/achievement=4861/we-are-legendary is clearly flavor text, like the old Tuskarmaggedon achievement, but still want to see what there is.<br />
<br />
10,000 quests complete?<br />
Master of all Professions?<br />
<br />
Heard something about the raid meta achievements, Classic Raider and Outlands Raider being guild achievements, and that the guild gets achievements by completing thingsby having 70% of the raid being the guild.<br />
<br />
Since raids in wrath and cata (and BC to a lesser extent (kara and ZA) can be 10 manned, I would assume the guild would get credit if 7 out of 10 people present where guildies.<br />
<br />
Would be interesting to find out if that applies for old content. If the guild goes and 10 mans Molten Core do they get credit towards Classic Raider for example.</div></div><hr />

I bet it'll be something that the Guild Master can alter for access depending on a person's guild rank (at least, for some things). I can't see it being very convenient if only the GM can do the mass summon or mass resurrection if he happens to not be able to attend a raid one night.</div></div><hr />

They gave everyone that clicked (like a soulwell or mage table) an elixir or pot. Not many people made them as there were very few options to the cauldrons that good raiders (min/maxers) would bring their own specific flasks/elixers. I have not seen anything so far in the alchemy updates to see if they are bringing this back. Although, with the guild talent, it would seem they are. I hope this time around it is a little better conceived.<br />

10% - 10% != 0%<br />

and no...it is 10% less durability loss, meaning 10% of 10%<br />
which is 1% less durability loss. So you lose 9% durability..WOOOOOOOO!!!!!</div></div><hr />

You don't get to choose. #1 is the first thing you get when the guild &quot;dings&quot;, and you have to obtain 2 to 4 before getting 5.<br />

The perks are automatic to everyone, the guild-rep lets you access the special items store. Which, I presume holds awesome pets, mounts and tabards and not much more.</div></div><hr />

These guild talents (along with the idea of guild levelling, and the very clever idea of having to gain rep before you get the best rewards with your guild) are AMAZING.<br />
<br />
please billz do not scrap this at the last second, if this goes live ill be a very happy player.<br />
<br />
My fingers are crossed that you can get these rewards in any size guild, Im going to be starting fresh on a new realm and would like to start a guild for just myself while levelling, i realise the progression will be slow but it will give me something else to progress in alongside talents/skill-ups etc.<br />

On priestress I would change tact. Make the party members stand behind the tank, tank positions himself behind the spots on the floor. This way the adds take care of themselves when they walk in the black shit and die. This depending on her frontal attacks in that case tank needs to face 90 degrees away from party.<br />

<br />
The only thing it mentions about alts/new-joins is that they won't be able to immediately buy a lot of the guild-items, and nothing about the perks being locked to them. So my guess is that once the guild unlocks the perk, it's there for everybody, but only those who contribute can spend their guild points to buy the items.</div></div><hr />

Yeah c'mon, you'll be able to deal those drugs to your guildies by the bank of your nearest capital just as easy as if you were in a guild house.<br />
<br />
But in all seriousness, I saw very little point to guild housing in GW, just the same as player housing in EQ2. The only MMO that's done any kind of housing right is FFXI, and even then only because the crowd around the moogle to change jobs otherwise would be horrendous.<br />
<br />
What are people looking for when requesting guild housing that isn't available already, if someone could answer?</div></div><hr />

If you take a look at the second tier of Marksmanship, you'll notice a talent called Improved Steady Shot.<br />
<br />
This should explain why he's using steady shot the way he is. If it does not, you may want to reconsider playing this game.</div></div><hr />

I understand the mechanics of hunters in cataclysm thanks very much you don't need to explain it, so don't give me that &quot;you may want to reconsider playing this game&quot; bullshit.<br />
<br />
If you look at his cooldowns while using steady shot, you will notice two are off cooldown at all times, and three when killshot can be used. So the rotation is a little like SS,SS,CS,SS,SS,AS,SS,SS but you never have enough focus to use all of your shots. So you have just used Chimera shot, and you have 6 seconds left on improved steady shot but you are now drained of focus; and even though you still have imp SS, you have no focus to cast any of your other shots.</div></div><hr />

I hope at least officers may use them as well, because our guild leader tends be not as hardcore as some of our other members. It would be kind of dull if only the guild leader, who does an awsome job at it, were the only one to use it and he is just present for 50-60% of our raids :(.</div></div><hr />

Fair enough but who's to say why he's doing it, except himself. It seemed like he was determined to keep the buff up at all times (moving not withstanding), and given that it's a new mechanic he could have simply been trying to see if it worked / was worth it.<br />
<br />
Best to reserve judgement if the evidence is inconclusive rather than assuming he's an idiot. As for the focus issue...I don't know. From the videos I'm not happy with it, but a lot of things change in any beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, as far as I know, you should definitely be able to take advantage of them, just as much as any larger guild. Even though you may not have enough people in your guild to do a 10man raid with, anytime one of you does a raid, it will count towards the guild's progression with these levels. And, the same goes for all the other things that help a guild to progress - like quests and dungeons, professions, other achievements, etc. To my knowledge, there are going to be all sorts of things that help a guild progress. All sorts of ways for each guild member to make an impact. So, your smaller guild shouldn't be hurt by this at all. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
from what i have read you should get exactly the same benefits in a small, hard working guild as you will in a big, hard working guild. :)<br />
<br />
as matiwariat said, as far as i have heard only the top few people in a guild contribute anyway, to stop people just whoring players to get higher levels i guess.<br />
<br />
You should be able to stay in your guild whatever size it is.<br />
<br />
I think the idea (besides fun progression + bonuses) is to attempt to deter people from deleting guilds/creating guilds every day of the week. Now they will have more substance and guilds should mean a bit more and stick around for longer, hopefully possesing more loyalty.</div></div><hr />

I can't see it being very convenient if only the GM can do the mass summon or mass resurrection if he happens to not be able to attend a raid one night.<br />
<br />
Huh? Wait...<br />
I hope you realise that mass summon/ressurection isn´t a 100% thing you need to raid.<br />
If guildmaster isn´t online that night you speak of, people should do it like the normal way. Ressurect, fly to raid... get summoned from stone/lock. Not a big hassle.<br />
Personally I think only the guildmaster should be able to use those skills, therefore making people actually do something to raid instead of standing in Goldshire/Barrens waiting for the summon.<br />
<br />
Probably that´s also a boredom since guildmasters nowadays change betwen themselves and officers the GM position.<br />
So basicly every guild member can do the mass thingies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Achievements were obviously taken from the XBOX 360, and mounted PvP and PvE is so bad they couldn't have stolen it from anywhere.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they will also steal the public quests from WAR and add textures that are higher resolution than 32x32 pixel tiles.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Yes the life of my warlock in the last 5 years has gone from fairly vital to a group/raid, to a 3 button DPS class. Nothing needs to be banished anymore, soulstone is barely used outside raids, summoning is useless, only two of the many curses is useful.<br />
<br />
But then Blizzard have gone from a game rich in immersion to basically a token collecting game. And it's still 2 hours per level on average. 10% on monsters - why not give people who already have a level 85 an extra 40%? <br />

yea it is, you will get heroism points from heroics and past teirs of raiding. the current teir would give valor (?) points.</div></div><hr />

You could say he made 'mistakes' but I don't see it that way. In the fight with the dragon, he was purposely jumping into the lava circles to see what type of damage they did. He is actually doing testing... in the beta test? wtf.<br />
<br />
Also, complaining about his UI is retarded since you can't use addons in the beta atm.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, I saw it the same way. With that I know that getting hit by the lava circles did around 15k or so, and then about 1.5k per second. Getting hit by that worm does 22k.</div></div><hr />

You will still get the same perks in your fun small guild, you dont have to change to a big guild.<br />
<br />
its not that hard to understand guys, you get the rewards regardless of guild size.<br />
<br />
nobody has to leave their friendly, cosy small guild to join one of the big boys on the server, if anything the guild levelling system helps the small friendly guilds, so now you have even more reason to stick together :)</div></div><hr />

Obviously beta is beta, but. Upon joining a guild (or logging into cata/4.0 patch I assume) I was automatically Neutral with them, and automatically granted Fast track Rank 1 5% XP bonus.<br />
<br />
Currently the guild tab is broken so I cant see how fast we're leveling if at all, but I don't imagine level 5 will be *that* difficult before 85.<br />
<br />
Not sure yet exactly in what way or how much it matters but I'm also getting 2 rep with my guild for every quest completed, and also at random times when killing mobs (I'm sure its not actually random, but every x number, every Y amount of damage done to mobs, every Z amount of exp gained, or whatever)</div></div><hr />

It seemed like he was determined to keep the buff up at all times (moving not withstanding), and given that it's a new mechanic he could have simply been trying to see if it worked / was worth it.<br />
<br />
Best to reserve judgement if the evidence is inconclusive rather than assuming he's an idiot. As for the focus issue...I don't know. From the videos I'm not happy with it, but a lot of things change in any beta.<br />
<br />
It's easy to say why he's doing it: He's inexperienced (not with Cataclysm, but with the Hunter class). <br />
<br />
He applied Serpent Sting &amp; Scorpid Venom at the beginning of each encounter but was very sloppy with managing them throughout. He did not always use Chimera Shot whenever off CD to keep his Serpent Sting rolling (which is why it fell off a lot). More often than not, he did not reapply Serpent Sting/Scorpid Venom if the boss had a phase interrupt, nor when his 2p T10 proc'd. Arbitrary Rapid Fire usage as well.<br />
<br />
Improved Steady Shot is there as a bonus for something you would already be doing in your standard rotation. Using Steady Shot regenerates Focus and keeps Scorpid Venom rolling. At the very least, he should be using Chimera Shot whenever it's off cooldown.<br />
<br />
However, these videos have nothing to do with his skill level or that he clicks certain abilities. It's to view the new content, so just enjoy it. ^_-</div></div><hr />

It is the new &quot;badge&quot; system, Heroism points(aka triumph badges) from Heroics and Valor points(frost badges) from the Raids. And i would think the you get heroism points from the old raids when a new tier is released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a bit confused here (bold parts).<br />
<br />
Let's say new player joins to lvl25 guild but he can't helps toward the progress because guild is lvl25 already. There's no progress when you &quot;capped&quot; (you don't receive honor if you @ 75k, you don't receive experience if you lvl 80 already etc.)<br />
<br />
What's happens then? How new player can progress in high level guild? Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would imagine that possibly somethings may be grandfathered in, but others won't on the grounds that it's not trackable (because it's not being tracked now).<br />
For example, even if 25+ people in the guild have an achievement for downing Heroic Arthas, there's not any possible way -in game- to &quot;prove&quot; that it was done as a guild, or under the current guild tag. EVEN having a realm first achievement on 25 people in the guild, although I'd imagine any rational person would agree that it was surely done as a guild, it's still only circumstantial evidence, not necessarily &quot;proof&quot;. Just like being exalted with the waterlords is a pretty good indication that you've done MC more than a few times, it wasn't enough to qualify for the complete MC achievement, as it's not direct indicator.<br />
There's not a huge amount of information yet how it will work, joining a new guild they said you would lose some of your rep but not all of it. You'll retain some of it based on ... something. Possibly the fact that you've killed Arthas on heroic, irregardless of whether or not the rest of the guild has may boost the guild's &quot;Exp&quot; by 1 or whatever, in which case in the above scenario, you'd likely get &quot;partial&quot; credit for having done it prior to the system being in.<br />
<br />
Somethings will obviously be &quot;grandfathered in&quot; such as completing guild achievements which will (presumably) boost guild rank/score. One reported achievement (that is not yet in beta) is to complete 10,000 quests as a combined guild. I can't imagine too many guilds that won't have this completed, my guild will have it with just 3-4 people. The guild should get this automatically when the system goes live, just like when achievements came out, you automatically already had &quot;Complete 100 quests&quot; etc etc<br />
<br />
TLDR: Somethings will count some won't and for the next two years we'll hear people say &quot;but my guild did X in wrath, why doesn't it show on our achievements qq&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
you read the talent wrong. it doesn't take 10% of the money you looted.<br />
<br />
for example the way you see it is I loot 10 gold. the guild bank would take 1 gold and i get 9 gold. that is wrong.<br />
<br />
the correct example is I loot 10 gold. the guild bank gets 1 gold but I get to keep the 10 gold i looted. this is correct.<br />
<br />
so the money that drops off of creatures and bosses is increased by 10% but that 10% goes to guild bank instead of your pocket.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but at least the movement makes the encounters look more interesting. A few of them looked like tank and spank though.<br />

If only the top 5 or 10 people contribute then really as long as your small guild is active you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />

Also, yes small guilds get all the same benefits from the guild lvling system, it is a ratio. No matter if you have 400 players or 4, only the top 10 earners in your guild (per day) contribute to your guild leveling. So yes, even 4 players in a guild will get all the buffs, it just might take longer.</div></div><hr />

This is what I was worried about. <br />
<br />
I haven't played WoW in months but have always looked forward to Cata to breath some fresh air into the game. Unfortunately it looks as if it is being dumbed down and released with not only a huge lack of features, but also killing off the way the game has been played. <br />
<br />
I'm all for change but the way they are taking numerous stats and talents out of the game makes it feel like a PS3 game where options are very limited.</div></div><hr />

Why do peopel think this? The thing has a 2 hr cooldown. People usually need to hearth to get gems and mats for enchants for new gear. I doubt a guild leader would want to use a 2 hr CD again for one person. Plus, it's not &quot;Select this&quot;, you get them at certain levels. So typically you get rank 1 at lvl 1, then rank 2 at lvl 5.</div></div><hr />

It seems like the guild levels in much the same way characters level. As your guildies run battlegrounds / instances, the guild gains XP. Every level the guild gets a new ability. But, only the 10 &quot;best&quot; characters per guild contribute to this leveling process. In other words, once a guild reaches lvl 25, that's it, that's the level cap. It'll be interesting to see how it works out at the start, though. &quot;QQ being forced to run old instances, blah blah....&quot;<br />
<br />
Ohh, and please note, none of the perks increase your DPS, max hp, etc. So you're really able to join and leave guilds as you want. Once you've got to the level cap and grinded out the few reputations you want, half the perks are useless anyway.<br />

As far as I know, a guild can't lose levels. Once a level is achieved, it's permanent. However, if a person leaves the guild, they naturally lose the right to that guild's levels and perks. But, I believe it's after a small grace period, to adjust for playful /gkicks that are immediately followed by the person rejoining.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Once a reward is unlocked, members will be able to purchase it with gold.&quot;<br />
<br />
So does that mean the guild unlocks cool stuff and then I can buy it, or guild unlocks stuff and the gm buys it?<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure anyone in the guild can purchase the cool stuff that's unlocked. However, if you're just entering the guild and there are already cool things unlocked, it's my understanding that you'll have to contribute, at least a small bit, and gain reputation with that guild to take advantage of those perks and buy them.</div></div><hr />

I guess every 7 uses you get an extra or something? I mean, what exactly is 15% of 1 ore or 2 herbs?<br />
<br />
The other problem I see is the &quot;contribution&quot; thing and the XP bonus. Unless there's a major guild achievement for reaching level 5 or equipping a green item, I don't see how you're going to earn the XP bonuses when you actually want them.<br />

This. I played EQ for 5 years, then left for WoW after it had only been out a couple months. This game has never been hard, if you're wanting to sound cool by acting &quot;hardcore&quot; go play some original EQ, or Zork for all I care. This game has always been less about making incredible challenges and more about making it just challenging enough to divide casuals from people who have more time than they care to admit to clear content faster.<br />
<br />

ok, thanks! <br />
A further question...will current achievements count towards the exp? Say, on day 1 of Cata, could a guild bounce up several levels if its top ten had tons of pvp achievements, all the vanilla, bc raids, loremasters and such? Just wondering if there's any reason to have some of these done beforehand or if they'll just need to be redone for the guild?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow was favored by the hardcore in vanilla, and has slowly been dumbed down year after year after year. Your other points were horrible fyi, if youre gonna be sarcastic and try to say the game was never hardcore lets use decent examples. Like:<br />
When did you have to spend hours upon hours of farming fire elementals for elemental fires for raid night on rag?<br />
When did you spend hours farming gold/mats for raiding?<br />
When did the game favor high end raiders to trump everyone in PvP with amazing epics while casuals were stuck in blues?<br />
When did epics used to be something you had to earn rather then be handed them for sneezing in the right direction? <br />
<br />
Also you cant compare a game like EQ to WoW. EQ was not difficult IT WAS JUST TEDIOUS AND GRINDY. Nothing in EQ was hard it just took forever to get anything done. Plane of time/nightmare etc in EQ was a joke, WoW was actually more difficult then EQ was in the beginning raiding wise, if you didnt think so then you must have been horrible at EQ. EQ needed more people then wow ever did for some fights and each fight took 5x as long. WoW had fights that took even the top guilds weeks to get done before they eventually got nerfed.<br />
<br />
While I dont want the game to be hardcore, it also cant be too easy and downie proof like its going right now. The game has gone from being required to play alot of hours a week raiding for new loots to welfare epics etc. The PvP gear was the first step in the right/wrong direction because it originally closed the gap between players who just pvped and those who pved, however the pvp loot at one point became much easier to get (tbc) which then turned to the mentality that PvE loot should be easier to get (heroics which then helped close the gap in pve). Now raiding is so easy that in WoTLK a new 80 can get a full set of raiding epics in one night PvE wise, and maybe in 2 weeks if you dont rush? of PvP epics. And instances like ICC were trivilized with a 30% buff to dmg/hp etc which allows people on alot of servers to pug ICC hardmodes lol.<br />
<br />
The only challenging istance of WoTLK was Ulduar hardmodes, everything else is pretty simplistic (minus the Hardmode LK, which is more just redic hp/dmg in hardmode not so much the encounter getting harder like ulduar). I dont think anyone (myself included) wants to go back to vanilla raiding, or vanilla inflation of gear etc, but with the new talent trees (yes currently in beta and first implementation) along with other roads the game is going, it looking very dumbed down and alot of ppl like myself who quit WotLK and are hoping CATA is gonna breathe new life into WoW are getting rather disappointed to say the least.<br />
<br />
The only pluses cata seems to have going right now<br />
- New feeling to old zones<br />
- Rated Bgs<br />
- Archeology seems cool might be interesting<br />
- new races<br />
- and this guild thing seems pretty cool<br />
- not having to do 10s/25 and being able to do 10 mans for the same loot while not having to wait for joe and his mom to log on because you cant fill a raid lol<br />
<br />
While this seems like a lot only 2 or so have long term &quot;coolness&quot; or the ability to keep your attention for awhile. Hope im wrong but well see.<br />
<br />
Edit: I do not want the game to go back to taking hours upon hours to get anything done, since i want to play it semi casually in Cata cause of work/friends etc and not wanting to ignore all that to be the &quot;best&quot;. But I also dont want it to be so simple its no longer a challenge or requires any thought behind encounters or talent choices etc. While u have sites for that it still takes alot of time and effort to find the optimal set or talent choices etc unless you just wait for someone else to do it and copy.</div></div><hr />

Lol, because killing bosses before Bloodlust/Heroism is finished like now is fun amirite? The more difficult, the better, the longer (in a reasonable amount), the better. Less Welfare, the better. Anyway, if enough of your kind cry it will get nerfed into oblivion like...always, don't worry you should have your welfare epics back by the 4.1<br />

Everything I hear about the game just makes me want to quit more and more.<br />
<br />
The lack of reading comprehension some people have is appalling. None of these perks are game breaking, meaning none are so powerful as to make you NEED to be in a guild. They are just what they are called. Perks. And no, you are not screwed if you want to make a new guild because not everyone will be in guilds, because as was mentioned previously, none of these perks are so over the top that it will make people join guild when they don't want to. And this system is the same for small guilds as it is for big guilds considering only the top 10 or so members will be counted for guild xp. Meaning the top 10 people who are contributing the most xp by pvping, leveling, running dungeons, etc. therefore a small guild can level at the same pace as a guild with 100's of people. Also, if you are in a super small guild of 5 people, it will just take you longer to get the perks, which is fine because if you are in a guild that small do you really need spells like mass rez and mass summon asap? No. This system is balanced whether you like it or not.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't the crying that got the content nerfed. Nice try on blaming the majority based on the vocal minority, though. The reason the bosses in LK die so fast now is because of how outrageously the average group outgears the content. When LK first came out, very few bosses went down in less than two minutes (though I'm sure there will be plenty of epeeners that want to claim otherwise). The majority of the content that was nerfed doesn't even directly relate to the bosses themselves, but rather the trash leading up to them (i.e. less trash, easier to kill, etc.).</div></div><hr />

i have a very small guild (7 of my irl friends)can we still benefit from the guild perks?...<br />
<br />
You should be able to gain from guild perks. I remember somewhere a blue saying the minimum guild member attendance requirement is 70%. I haven't heard anything different since then.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mackeyser</div><div class="date">2010-07-19, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer a few questions (and by all means correct me if I'm wrong or if something's changed)<br />
<br />
Heroism points are the new badges/emblems. <br />
<br />
GMs will have NO say over who gets what. Guild members will have to earn reputation with their guild. The levels of perks will likely be divided by the familiar neutral/friendly/honored/revered/exalted and thus the first 5 will likely be initially available to anyone just joining, but anything beyond that (if the guild has earned them) will require contribution to earn rep. Once a person CAN learn a perk, they will have to pay gold to BUY it and will lose it if they leave the guild or are kicked, tho not immediately. <br />
<br />
I don't think the ways of earning rep have been fully articulated at this time.<br />
<br />
I don't think the ways for guilds to earn guild perks have been fully articulated at this time.<br />
<br />
It has already been stated that only the top 20 or so &quot;producers&quot; will count towards a guild's progress so even small guilds will be able to progress fairly rapidly. That doesn't mean everyone else won't need to contribute because they'll need the rep.<br />
<br />
A side effect of this is that farmers will NEED to be in the guild, not in banking alt guilds in order to partake of the bonuses. Further, they'll need to quest/daily or whatever enough to earn enough rep with the guild to learn #22, which likely means being exalted with the guild.<br />
<br />
Yes, this basically kills alt guilds and may require guilds to look for &quot;Roster Officers&quot; who actually spend the time to keep track of the expanded rosters and alts and whatnot. The good news is that it puts a premium on well run guilds, be they big or small. No, small guilds of 10-20 people won't be horribly behind those huge guilds with 500 people. They won't have as much money, but if they put the work in and are capable, they should move along nicely as is the design. <br />
<br />
I really like it, frankly. <br />
<br />
Mass summon and Mass Res really works for progression. I'm looking forward to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be cool. I asked my sister Alayea about it, and she recalled a blue post addressing the matter. The blue (paraphrasing here) said the code dealing with the backpack is very old and any changes in it would likely cause very interesting but unwelcome side-effects; and is not a priority at this time.<br />

yea it is, you will get heroism points from heroics and past teirs of raiding. the current teir would give valor (?) points.<br />
<br />
Valor is correct. :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2010-07-19, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to add one piece of information.<br />
<br />
You don't have to actually contribute to a guild leveling in order to gain reputation with the guild, you simple have to do the things that WOULD allow your guild to level. Let me explain.<br />
<br />
The current system only allows the top 10 contributors each day to help raise the level of the guild. This is to prevent everyone from abandoning smaller guilds. Small guilds with 10 players will have all 10 players contribute guild experience by killing bosses, questing and doing professions etc. Large guilds will only have their top 10 contributors for that day contribute.<br />
<br />
But what happens if you are in a big guild, and you are ALWAYS the 11th placed person in your guild as far as helping the guild gain levels. Technically, you aren't helping the guild level at all because your contribution isn't counted. However, all the activities that you did that day DO count for you gaining rep for your guild.<br />
<br />
As far as being forced to join a large guild in order to receive the perks. Not at all. Almost every useful thing you do in the game, even if you solo will add to guild experience. Doing quests, killing overland mobs, pugging dungeons, battlegrounds.. all give guild experience even if you are playing alone. If you look at the perks.. the first 5 really are nice for solo-type players, and solo-type players will be able to get them even if they have a guild comprised of only their alts.<br />
<br />
The only thing solo players will miss out on will be some of the achievement perks, which are mostly cosmetic things (except for heirlooms). But even then, we aren't sure what achievements are necessary to unlock heirlooms, it could be something solo players could do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree. Anyone else remember a time when any items you mailed to one of your alts took 30-60 minutes? It changed because Blizzard had done overall hardware upgrades. Instantaneous mailing is limited to characters of the same account (and fellow guild members if that specific perk survives to live) because of the technical aspect - no matter how awesome the software, that same software will still be tied to the limits of the hardware.<br />
<br />
Now if you prefer a RP reason: The wizards that sort and teleport your item(s) and/or correspondence to their destinations don't get paid very well. As in, you get more money by slaying Hogger than mugging one of the wizards. Also, their health insurance is through a goblin HMO.<br />

I am wondering as a Shammie, does Hasty Hearth work for Astral Recall? Since AR is basically shared CD time as a Hearth.<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt it. Astral Recall has a CD completely separate from the Hearthstone, as well as having its own glyph that reduces the CD by 50%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, no, no, no, no.<br />
NONE of these things will effect you in combat. The reason those heirloom gears are good ISN'T the xp boost, it's the DPS and HP boost! It's because the arcanite reaper heirloom can 1-shot anything it touches at lower levels! And have you tried to find trinkets / shoulders at low level? The xp bonus is just an added luxury. Yes, you can still level fast without the xp bonus bits.<br />
<br />
The flask thing only relates to cauldrons. For those that missed them, in TBC there are/were certain cauldrons that your WHOLE RAID could get resistance pots from, like how health stones work. But the cauldrons aren't free, far from it - they're fairly expensive. That's right - these aren't &quot;single player&quot; buffs, they're EXPENSIVE raid buffs. In other words, flasks from the guild bank. Working for 2 hours. Like flasks on alchemists. <br />
<br />
This isn't game breaking stuff. These are pretty minor gains. The only strangely high up one is the extra mining / herbing one. But even then, i've not done herbing for ages, that's what AH is for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mostly. Cosmetic.<br />
You can pretty much split the list into 2 sections - leveling / rep gains, and raid tools. <br />
<br />
Anything which is rep-based, xp-based, or run-speed-outside-pvp based, is going to be almost useless after you've reached max level and got some gear from questing. These are ALL LOW LEVEL, so even your small alts guild will get these quickly.<br />
<br />
The raid tools are things like extended fish feasts / flasks, cheaper repairs, extra durability, mass resurrect, etc. These are all late on. These will make a raid go a bit smoother, but WON'T EFFECT YOUR RAID'S ABILITY TO KILL A BOSS. Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really like the guild perks as currently presented. They are fun and will not be game changers for end-game content, so players don't feel pressured to become a part of a guild so they can feel like they are performing at their best. It has reasonable restrictions in place so 10-man raiders do not feel pressured to recruit for &amp; run 25-man content.<br />
<br />
I see my guild loving this just for the fact that the perks are, in a way, achievements AND very helpful for alts. (Many of the players in my guild, including myself, are achievement w****s. And serious altoholics. *nervous laugh* )<br />
<br />
Stonecore: Surprisingly, I found myself actually disliking the mechanics I saw in the videos. :( I normally either like something or don't mind it. The fights for the first few bosses seem very re-hashed, and that the only one which could require true concentration is the priestess battle - mostly because it would be a slight game to see how many adds the party could gib using the boss' own ability.</div></div><hr />

Totally agree with this one.<br />
<br />
Extra 1k on each 10k looted isn't really nothing.<br />
This 15% mining, skinning and disenchanting (!!!!!) bonus is somewhat insane. Someone without 15% bonus simply won't be able to compete in a saturated enchanting material market.<br />
<br />
People, who for some reason preffer to stay unguilded or in few person guilds, are getting quite massively screwed (read: forced to join some &quot;We're frendly social guild, lf everything!&quot;).<br />

How would this work?! I mean, how can you gain 15% extra on 1 ore? or 2 flowers? or 1 skin? ._O Anyone care to explain? im stumped. Should it be possible &quot;Gives the player a chance to gain an additional resource gained from Mining, Skinning, Herbalism, and Disenchanting by 15%.&quot;?<br />

Easy.<br />
You have 33% chance to have one herb, 33 % chance to have 2 herbs and 33% to have 3 herbs.<br />

<br />
Raw 15% chance to double your loot solves everything.<br />
<br />
The % distribution really does not matter, since all 15% loot increase means than in the long run instead of 1000 pieces you are gonna have roughly 1150 pieces of loot.</div></div><hr />

WOLTK Heroics were never, ever, hard. I was playing back then.
