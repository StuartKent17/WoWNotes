Really? You're bitching about this? Inscription doesn't make money off glyphs often, true, but they make money off Vellum, Noble's Decks, and their shoulder enchant bonus is amazing. Who's to say that blizzard won't tier out the cards this time around too? They seem to be making more effort to keep profession items viable through all tiers, rather than just as starter epics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very good point. I'd also like to point out that these glyphs still need to be learned. So they will still be purchased over the AH. All this 'change' will do to scribes imo is drive up glyph prices since you only need to learn them once. However, they will still need to be learned, so they will be guaranteed to be purchased.<br />
<br />
Another point of interest in the post on august 30th was that scribes can now make random patterns and recipies for other professions. So they will be relied on even more by other professions. It's still a viable way to make gold.<br />
<br />
At least, that's how it seems to me. But, beta is beta. Things change every week. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know why the damn Inscription profession is still in the game at this point. No one wants glyphs because they never need to change them even on the retail system. Darkmoon trinkets will be obsolete by 4.1, if not sooner. This is just another kick in the balls for people who bothered to take it up.<br />
<br />
You're right, I guess. They should just toss it out of the game. It wasn't a very noteworthy profession and I never found Scribes to be particularly coveted in the game. I mean, we have enough professions already; just add more optional skills like cooking to the game if you must.</div></div><hr />

Your gonna love cata lava burst. They already increased base damage by 25% and made it so that overload can proc it. Then again our health pools will be so large so that our new lavaburst till take off less % hp than it does now. <br />

That ghost wolf looks so old, instead of them adding alot of new stuff they really should upgrade the 6 year old models, looking at the druid forms and ghost wolf etc they seriously need an upgrade, and to have these same bad looking models after 3 expansions is pretty bad.</div></div><hr />

Heroic SFK and DM is awesome! Seems like Blizzard finished on time with it :)!<br />
At least i know there will be two semi-long instances i like to play!<br />

Edit:<br />
For the people who say they were waiting for other stuff and got glyphs news:<br />
I think as every other Multinational Company in the world, Blizz has different teams working on different parts of the game.<br />
For this build, the guys who were given the task to remake the glyphs were finished with the ones you see and want to test it. I'm guessing that the same team does the talent trees. At least that's how i think it works.<br />
<br />
On the worgen mount: i think it's done, Blizz just wants to keep it for a later update to keep the hype rollin'.</div></div><hr />

In cata many people will want to buy ALL the glyphs for that char, for both specs (I'll probably do that), sales will skyrocket. Get a new alt? Buy him a bajillion glyphs. Unless they remove the buyable glyphs and give them to new chars by default, Inscription will become the most profitable proffession out there.<br />
Also, all the SMART inscribers I talked to these days make SHITLOADS of money from inscription, much more than I do from JC, and I do quite well. People make alts, change specs, there will never be a lack of demand when it comes to glyphs.</div></div><hr />

There's off-hands and relics and there seems to be a method to make random recipes people with the other professions can use. It might not end up making as much money as it does now, but there's still a lot of potential money to be made there.<br />
<br />
On a related note, would it be possible for Boub to include with each of the glyphs in this news post what type of glyph they are? How useful they are does depend heavily on whether they're minor, major or prime glyphs.</div></div><hr />

If you look closer, there are Prime Glyphs in what I belive should be the Major Glyph slots. If I'm right, the three big ones are supposed to be either Major/Prime (Feels like those are Prime),the three middle ones should be the other and the little ones Minor obv. Just can't figure out how there can be 4 Primes there, in two Prime and two Major slots. Have I missed something here? o.O<br />
<br />
Now that i look closer you are right, it`s rather confusing...you have some prime glyphs (according to the side filtering) in major AND prime slots</div></div><hr />

The same way you have during the entire expansion. Vellum, Darkmoon decks, starter epics and the occasional glyph. Glyphs are a scribe's lowest income. I have no idea what you're all whining about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Inscription requires a LOT of constant maintenance and supervision to make a profit over the auction house on a near populated server.<br />
You can't simply post your glyphs once a day and expect to make a profit.<br />
<br />
With the new feature of Cataclysm which allows Glyphs to be removed and re-applied at will, you will become a one time customer instead of a repeat customer. The chances of a casual Scribe (myself) making a profit on you just dwindled out the window since I can assume you're only coming to shop once. The person who constantly keeps their glyphs at the lowest price on the AH will make the profit, thus the one who spends the most time on the AH.<br />
<br />
At least with the current model, and with Jewelcrafting/etc, you have a chance to make a profit on the customer more than one time, since they constantly get new gear/respec.<br />
<br />
This change will really hurt profit margins on a Scribe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mind you, I'm not complaining as less people having inscription: more business for me. But I make around 1000g with an investment of less than 50 gold with glyphs and Auction House addons. Make 1000g with an investment of 200 with JC (but to be fair it's a lot quicker). Darkmoon Cards currently have an almost even investment-return ratio (considering the chances of a Nobles Card vs a Prisms card). Vellums and starter epics I honestly never ventured into the market. <br />
But currently yes, mass marketing of Glyphs is one of the most remunerative markets.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's different on your server... but on all 3 of the ones I've been on. <br />
Vellum sales: none or not even worth the cost vs herbs.<br />
Darkmoon Decks: Were okay for a bit, but the only people that buy them for the last year have been people working on insane. Also the randomness of the cards made profit way too low.<br />
Epics: Well free epics and badges removed this totally. Wasn't even worth it to DE it before either unless needed that one last shard for enchanting.<br />
Glyph: This is were the money was/is. Yes you have to log in every hour or so and check for undercuts (usally 3-4 different people on each server do this) But you make a lot more then any other source of income. I only posted twice yesterday and I made 1k. 1k in like 10 mins of work.<br />
<br />
JC is kinda the same way, the more you watch it, the more you'll make... but it's def making more money vs my inscription.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the glyphs. Is it just me or do most of the glyphs seem... unchanged.<br />
<br />
Exorcism, Holy Shock, Judgement, Seal of Insight, Beacon of Light, Cleansing, Consecration, Divinity, Focused Shield, Avenging Wrath, Hammer of Justice, Hammer of Wrath, Seal of Truth, Turn Evil, and every Minor Glyph seem very similar or the same to the Glyphs for these spells/their respective counterparts on live. I hope they do consider revising some, otherwise Paladins will probably be using a similar glyph set up as they are on live.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, obviously Templar's Verdict is a placeholder value, but does it actually increase damage by that much in beta? Would be crazy if it did.</div></div><hr />

I know for a fact that even if I do have inscription, it was less of a hassle to buy the glyph in the AH than to make it myself on my scribe alt... so good riddance really.<br />
<br />
Obviously, scribes will make tons of money at the start with trinkets/new glyphs/etc... just like it was the case with WOTLK...<br />

Meh, probably not. Those early money makers you're talking about will probably use whatever the new ink is. Selling a level 80 off-hand made with Ink of Sea isn't likely to help you much, it's the new 85 off-hand made with Molten Ink (or whatever) that will give you a nice early boost in cash.</div></div><hr />

What do you think it is? All Blizzard is going to do is recolor the thing, like they did, and call it a day. Blizzard recycles multitudes more stuff than they give new things. They're still recycling stuff from Vanilla even like enchant glows, various proc/spell effects, etc.<br />
<br />
I wish I had lower expectations, but should you lower them for a company that makes as much profit monthly as they do? That likes to say their the best in the business? That they have the most successful MMO and RTS ever? Instead of as they make more money, they put less of the money back into the game. Either that, or they're the most poorly managed company out there, and their creativity is running on empty.</div></div><hr />

Wow you're looking at the profession now, at the end of the expansion. I looked at it as a whole. Every profession offers a burst of income at the start of every expansion. And guess what. Inscription offers the biggest burst of income. The amount of money you could make off of starter epics and darkmoon cards more than made up for any disadvantage you might have had towards later stages of the expansion.<br />
<br />
And yes I have a scribe as well as every other profession. I sell vellums like a mad man. Excellent way to make money.<br />

I sell vellums like crazy on my server. Guess it is different. And you talk about cost vs. profit. I never ran into that issue since I have a herbalist and never spent anything on mats.<br />
<br />
If you want to compare profit though on my server for instance Scribes have it the best. Herbs are dirt cheap on the ah whereas JC have it hardest since cut gems almost exclusively sell for less than uncut gems. So buying raw mats isn't even an option for them.</div></div><hr />
