<br />
Yes, the normal achivement for killing him is a wolf. <br />
The meta achive is a protodrake ( with the boss model we face in the raid). <br />
But I was actually hoping for garrosh to drop an epic mount :(</div></div><hr />

4set makes more sense as something you can intentionally put on a tank when there's damage incoming, which is exactly when you want to stick a few absorbs on as well.</div></div><hr />

Where do you and others see that she dies? Listening to the sound files implies she doesn't die just that she gets severely hurt more than likely. Much like how Theron was wondering where the blood was coming from on him. Looks like they both get involved in the battle and get hurt pretty badly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It'd be a waste to have built Jaina up just to kill her off in a raid. She's a character with a bit of conflict now, the story is more tense when she's involved. Prejudiced by both Theramore and the Divine Bell incident, she's a bit of a loose cannon now... or at least has the potential to be. Kalecgos and Varian can't always be there to talk her down. Never sure if she's going to go too far; makes her interesting.<br />
<br />
Lor'themar, too, but for the opposite reason. Pushed even further into leadership of his people and has a torn allegiance from the horde. Assuming they don't just drop him, he has the opportunity to be a big player in the new horde.</div></div><hr />

I bet at some point alliance fight with Jaina and Horde with Lor' and the sound files are just part of the quest/scenario failure speech. I dont see either of them dieing lore wise.</div></div><hr />

I really liked where Jaina and Lorthemar are heading though. Pretty sure neither of them dies, just injured (Jaina could be just having an orcgasm, but that's less likely). If they were dying, there'd be a lot more dialogue than just some whimpering. So yeah, they will recover, but I gues sthe question is who did it to them. Sylvanas? Troll?

Lorthemar mentions something about 'what's gotten into the Dark Lady?' This would be a shocker considering how much effort they put into both of these characters recently, but it would be something that very few would expect and make it one of those rare lore moments that make you sit back and say 'holy shit!' Definitely a Game of Thrones type moment and one I would heartily congratulate Blizzard on.</div></div><hr />

Well it got more useless, seems like they want us to only go for 2piece and &quot;Thunderforged&quot; offpieces like in this Tier.<br />

When Affliction shines it often has no shard regen problems or haunt isn't used at all. In Singletarget it comes in handy but its a bonus which only is beneficial when shards are low and that makes it so unappealing, usually they should be straight buffs IMHO.</div></div><hr />

Lorthemar is just telling her not to bring the elves back to life in the same way you tell a dog not to pee on the carpet. Honestly he is rather nonchalant about it.

Oh I understand why. Like I said, I'm just more surprised that no one is raging about it. They've raged about just about any other appearance Thrall has had since Cataclysm.

What's the deal really. Undead (the Forsaken) can not procreate, considering how many are getting slaughtered on a daily basis she needs to care for her people, thus she's trying to raise undead. Besides she doesn't enjoy the trust other leaders have been enjoying, there's Kor'Kron in UC since Wrath, everyone thinks they can command her around etc. etc. She is in the Horde to protect her people, single and only reason, there is no other benefits she sees from it, she had no choice. <br />
<br />
Everything she has done so far was for the benefit of her own people safety, that includes being talked down, treated like dirt, indulged Kor'Kron pressence and orders in her own City (and she has done nothing, even tho everyone agrees this has gone too far). For me, she is the strongest leader of them all and if he story isn't going to become epic I don't know.</div></div><hr />

He gets resurrected by Sylvanas and replaces Kael'thas as the ruler of Tempest Keep. Once we defeat him in the next expansion, The More Burning Crusade, he is returned to unlife once more and moves to Magister's Terrace.<br />
<br />
For him, death would only be a setback.</div></div><hr />

I just want to know if the Garrosh sound files has him talking to Thrall at all. It seems odd there's been little interaction with him and Thrall so far when imo he should be the one to finish off Garrosh.</div></div><hr />

Don't even joke about it! http://www.emofaces.com/png/15/emoticons/scared.png<br />

:p<br />
<br />
<br />
And no one has ever killed thrall, garrosh, or varian? Thought so...<br />
Gamon was the only attackable NPC (critters don't count) in Orgrimmar for years because he was the objective for a rogue quest. Then he got to have a comedic moment in WotLK when death knights are first starting out. Then Blizzard decided in Cataclysm to majorly buff him for the lols. And now in MoP, he got turned into a rare this patch.<br />
<br />
My point is, Gamon was never considered a serious character. So what is Blizzard trying to do by making Gamon do one from behind all of a sudden without much of anything (yet) to support it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess is there's a &quot;Lose&quot; scenario in one of the boss fights that does not involve your raid wiping, but instead Lorthemar/Jaina losing all their health. They both have death speeches, and Jaina also has sounds for damage being taken. I don't think they'll be killed lore-wise, but it will be the player's job to keep them alive during part of the encounters. If I'm right in guessing, anyway.</div></div><hr />

New expansion will be announced in November. Ptr will start in January, expansion release in April.<br />
<br />
It doesn't have to do with Fall, although that matters too, but simple maths. It is extremely unlikely that Blizz will cut down the beta test time (around half a year) to half, or any other part of the testing/development cycle. And if the game isn't even announced, it cannot have beta starting until some time after Blizzcon (unless the announcement is inexplicably made well before Blizzcon). Then the months add up and a fall relese is the earliest possible.<br />
<br />
It's been the same way EVERY SINGLE EXPANSION. The community indulge in wishful thinking and suddenly every says &quot;hey the game is gunna com out earlier than everyone thinks&quot;, then everyone starts believing in a spring release, for no logical reason. Meanwhile, the cogwheels at Blizz keep moving at the inevitable pace, and then summer comes and everyone is a bit disappoitned that the expansion is &quot;late&quot; (when in fact it isn't) and eventually it comes out in the fall/winter as always. <br />
<br />
Given that Blizzon is even later than usual this year, and still no early announcement, and when you add up the necessary steps always undertaken (testing, dev cycle etc) it is extremely unlikely that next xpac comes out before Q4 2014. If they wanted an earlier release, they would have held a Blizzcon last year instead of cancelling it, or moved it to Spring this year and then announced the next xpac. Instead they pushed it back to November. That is a pretty clear sign.</div></div><hr />

You are joking right? You think it will be out Q4 2014? That would make this the longest wait from final patch to new expansion ever. And no one is going to stand for that now. It would be completely out of character for Blizzard to take THAT long to put it out when they've been pumping out the patches at an unusually fast rate right now. <br />
<br />
If next expac didn't come out til Q4 2014 like you suggest then that's gonna kill a shit load of subscriptions. One raid/season lasting for a year and a half now just won't work.</div></div><hr />

• If two Shaman drop Healing Rain with Conductivity, when one ends it prematurely ends the other<br />
• You are able to keep Earthliving weapon when switching from Restoration<br />
<br />
With 4 targets (using only Chain Lightning) I'm seeing 300k DPS using only the tier and available PvP items and Healing Rain never ends by itself (with Elemental Overload + Echo) and will proc Earthliving Weapon. With all of that together with the Elemental 4pc, we're able to do way too much with only one ability (and a single cast of Healing Rain). <br />
<br />
Yes, it's only great on trash or fights with adds but it puts Elemental way ahead in terms of utility with very little effort.</div></div><hr />
