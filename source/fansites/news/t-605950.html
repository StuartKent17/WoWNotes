The Wrath of the Lich King Bestiary (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/features/bestiary/index.xml) has been updated with a new creature: the Iron Dwarf. <br />
The Explorers' League has scoured the far corners of the world, seeking to uncover the truth behind the origins of the dwarves. Now it seems they may be one step closer to unlocking the secrets of the past.<br />
<br />
The latest clues come from ancient dig sites within the Howling Fjord, where the iron dwarves were first encountered. Etched with runes of power - and with lightning pulsing beneath their thick, metallic skin - they may represent the missing link between the dwarves and the legendary titans of myth. Unfortunately the malevolent iron dwarves have openly defied the Explorers' League and seem intent on destroying any and all artifacts connecting them to the shadowed recesses of history.<br />

Noblegarden In-Game Event This Sunday<br />
The great feast of Noblegarden (http://www.wowwiki.com/Noblegarden) has long been celebrated by the races of the Alliance and recently adopted by those of the Horde. On this joyous day, it is customary for the nobles and lords from each race to hide coins, candy, and the occasional treasures within special eggs painted to look like wildflowers. These eggs are then scattered around the major cities for the citizenry to find. From heroes to commoners, and everyone in between - the feast of Noblegarden is meant to bring communities together to share the joy of life and friendship.<br />

TTR Battle this Saturday<br />
The Tournament Test Realm battle is today ! If you missed the first post it will take place this Saturday from 12PM to 4PM PDT. Hortus also posted two small updates about the test realms and the battle.<br />
Hortus won't attend the TTR Battle<br />
Um yeah &lt;cough&gt;&lt;cough&gt; I think I'm coming down with something and won't be able to participate... sorry. Seriously though. Sorry guys I won't be there tomorrow. I'm sure one of the CMs will be happy to hand out goodies though. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5461887003&amp;postId=53754735158&amp;sid=1#18))<br />

New Comic - Teh Gladiators<br />
A new WoW comic is now online, Teh Gladiators (http://www.tehgladiators.com/?p=1) ! According to the author it's gonna be a weekly updated comic strip series that should evolve as the PVP Arena evolves in the game.<br />
<br />
The Genesis<br />
You know how every story has a beginning... and an end, well, this one is no different. We've decided we'd run the first fourteen pages as an intro to the storyline. You get to know the protagonists, what they are about and what the comic is about.<br />
<br />
We will keep this bad boy updated on a weekly basis, every Saturday. Ideally, we'd like to keep the subsequent pages as autonomous as possible as far as their events, so that you can sort of &quot;jump in&quot; at any point. But we're not making any promises. Sometimes the plot will dictate otherwise (and, of course, our actual jobs might as well).<br />

Yeah, I can see those dwarves clearly, they're so stunning and impressive with their thick armor and...<br />

oh, wait... they won't just drop 2-3 pc. of Netherweave, will they? Cause if they do, they won't fit into my gold-farming scheme at level 80. Well at least they seem to be melee characters, so my mage should be able to farm them pretty mana-efficiently. We'll see...</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree more models would be nice, wouldn't that increase program size? Vast majority of models in Outland are Azeroth models, albeit with different skins, yet look at the size of Burning Crusade, fancy new models would increase patch sizes, install times and take more hard drive space. <br />
<br />
Expect more of the same in the next expansion (we get Bantha though, YAY!).</div></div><hr />

It doesnt matter how big the folder is. Btw AoC is 35 Gb...</div></div><hr />
