<br />
<br />
The Process<br />
<br />
The in game story is planned out months and sometimes years in advance.<br />
Cinematics have always functioned as an important point in a story in Blizzard games' history, and it started with the Wrathgate in WoW.<br />
The game can create good ambient story, but cinematics shine in telling the more emotional story points.<br />
<br />
Story in Battle for Azeroth<br />
<br />
Bfa was a good opportunity to bring Jaina back into the story and develop all the different experiences she has had throughout the story.<br />
People have strong feelings about the state of the Horde right now, and the conflict allows good storytelling and depth to develop.<br />
The two philosophies of honor and conquest is the core of the ongoing story within the Horde.<br />
Zekhan was already planned to be in Old Soldier as Saurfang's counterpart before players fell in love with him.<br />
Bwonsamdi was influenced a lot by how his voice actor embodied him.<br />
Christie Golden wrote the dialogue for the Bwonsamdi and Rastakhan cinematic.<br />
There will be a lot more interaction between Talanji and Bwonsamdi going forward.<br />
Flynn was super fun to develop as a counterpart to Talia.<br />
<br />
Cinematics and Cutscenes<br />
<br />
Prior cinematics were pretty self contained, but as the story has progressed, a lot of cinematics have bridged to the next.<br />
The team has weekly meetings where multiple departments discuss the cinematics being developed and how to improve them.<br />
Cataclysm was when a lot of the new cutscene technology was developed and this is why there are a lot of in game scenes (Uldum) because they team had a new toy that they ran wild with.<br />
The Terror of Darkshore cutscene was a moment to show the ferocity of the night elves seen in past games.<br />
<br />
Customization<br />
<br />
The night warrior customization was a way for players to support Tyrande's transformation and vengeance for Teldrassil.<br />
Golden eyed Blood Elves was a story choice to represent the light's role in the cleansing of the Sunwell.<br />
<br />
Storytelling<br />
<br />
The team wanted to let the player have some agency in the direction of the Horde and not just watching it develop.<br />
Perspective has a major role in storytelling. There can be a difference between a character making a mistake and a write making one.<br />
The Saurfang quest is not necessarily fundamentally changing the questing system of the game, but it was a moment to add meaningful choices to the story. <br />
Choices will be used when it makes sense to create a more invested story.<br />
The payoff for your choices will be meaningful.<br />
There are moments in the Battle for Dazar'alor that haven't been seen yet. Terran showed off his Mekkatorque shirt with a &quot;hint hint&quot; when he said this.<br />
Olds Gods and Azshara are coming!<br />
The war between the Horde and Alliance will culminate in something deep and meaningful.<br />
There is so much passion and love for the characters on the team and they want to do right by them.<br />
Christie Golden coming on board was a huge win for the story team.<br />
The team hopes that when Battle for Azeroth's story concludes and the &quot;last funeral pyre is lit&quot; players will have seen it as a great story that changed the world of Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Months. I think that sometimes it's even weeks.<br />
<br />
When I said that people laughed at me saying that Blizzard is writing lore ONLY YEARS before.<br />
I've shown the proof, like the Garrosh dying in the SOO and people still didn't believe me.<br />
<br />
I think that Blizz is just acting to what playerbase likes(and even changing dramatically quests in the PTR etc.), which makes it even worse, instead of trying to make a nice coherent story. And yes, I think that's wrong, imagine Tolkien publishing his first book and then listen to the fans all over the world and use their ideas/try to get as many readers as possible... That would be massive failure.</div></div><hr />

George and JK don't cram their stories with massive, glaring plot holes that are completely ignored, randomly retcon events, have character's entire personalities evaporate to fit their story on the fly, etc.</div></div><hr />

Thats why so many in here are so dissapointed. When you finally stop believeing your expectations of this Vlog like stuff from them is gonna be fulfilled. You will be much less dissapointed, angry!<br />
<br />
STOP EXPECTING THESE TO BE DECENT! <br />
<br />
THEY WILL NEVER BE.<br />
<br />
Learn from the past ones what a majority said of those in general. Do not expect it to be different, or you will be dissapointed over and over again.<br />
<br />
Freaking humans... we never learn -.-</div></div><hr />

Same. They've set up multiple Arthas connections and the obvious payoff to that would be for Sylvanas to have a moment of clarity and realize she's becoming that which she hated (Arthas) and do a big heroic sacrifice.</div></div><hr />

Well... individuality have been painted as something of the Horde (look at the Nightborne joining the Horde, that's one of their main premises), the Alliance is more about unity (under the King, that's why the Alliance look like&quot;Humans &amp; friends&quot; most of the time)</div></div><hr />

If the story isn't considered good until the very end, that's a problem. They keep saying gameplay will get better or the story will make sense later...we aren't paying for the state of the game later. Things are bad now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People have strong feelings about the state of the Horde right now, and the conflict allows good storytelling and depth to develop. Strong feelings all right. The Horde has become a joke to the point that many players have quit wow. I can't believe they think a forced conflict can create good storytelling.<br />
<br />
Perspective has a major role in storytelling. There can be a difference between a character making a mistake and a write making one. If by Prespective you mean the Prespective of a crazy Warchief and the prespective of the rest of Azeroth. I suppose the same prespective can be said for every villain.<br />
<br />
The payoff for your choices will be meaningful. Apart from the Nzoth quest I can't see what those that side with Sylvannas will get as the story will go the same way as Garrosh.<br />
<br />
The war between the Horde and Alliance will culminate in something deep and meaningful. What deep and meaningful can this possibly be? It's portraied as a War between White and Black at the moment. How much more deep can you go.\<br />
<br />
The team hopes that when Battle for Azeroth's story concludes and the &quot;last funeral pyre is lit&quot; players will have seen it as a great story that changed the world of Azeroth. Not a chance. Sylvannas wont have a funeral pyre. I cant see anyone apart from her most fanatic fanbase will care if she bites the dust.</div></div><hr />

We wanted to kill Malfurion to make the Night Elves weaker and instead he got away, Sylvanas got triggered by a ranger and called for their home to be burnt to the ground, making things way worse. We couldn't defend Undercity, which lead to Sylvanas killing HER OWN TROOPS to raise them as undead out of desperation, and then she blew up Lordaeron out of even more desperation. We found Derreck Proudmoore's corpse, Sylvanas went all super-villain with it and raised him to try and mind-control him, and he escaped thanks to Baine and Zellig.

You cannot make this shit up.<br />
<br />
I feel that was them realizing they fucked up in terms of answering questions, the only one they did that I remember being asked was about the Night Elf eyes and players get that.<br />
<br />
It's great to see them be passionate about their jobs, but I think they spent way too long exploring their teams and process - maybe it's to set the stage and future ones won't have that obviously. Still that's not a good format to use a 1 hr livestream for, would've been best to quickly explain who they are and get into the meat of people's questions.<br />
<br />
Or better yet they should've wrote their introductions within the original post for the livestream, which has now changed to be a VoD of the now finished livestream with no mention of original post description.<br />
<br />
Especially since in their original post they said &quot;Let us know in the comments below what story and lore discussion you’d like to hear&quot; but over 50% of this livestream was about their inner team/work process and call-backs to older Blizzcon videos.<br />

I know right! When Garrosh tried to conquer death itself and establish total control over all life, flooding Azeroth with the undead I knew he had to be taken down! And when Sylvanus found that old god artifact in a ruin and became corrupt from its immense power, needing to be killed to get a better suited warchief! Oh wait, those aren't the same in any way. Why, because all you see is &quot;Warchief of Horde, Evil (From outside perspectives), Killed. Therefore, all who fit that are the same! :rolleyes: &quot;. That is like claiming all dictators were the same because they ruled their country, were mostly terrible, and died in the end. Sylvanus' story is MUCH more complex than Garrosh's. Garrosh was a minor character that suddenly became warchief and wanted to show off his axe size to everyone, quickly being cut down. Sylvanus has been preparing for YEARS, has been corrupt ever since her death, and is only NOW taking a move. Simply because the generalized version of their stories (That we know of atm) follows a similar path, does NOT make their stories identical. You don't assume every great engineer that has born and died all had the same life story. Sorry for the long reply.</div></div><hr />

I don't recall an expansion getting THIS much dislike before regarding the story. Even during the early stages before the expansion was released, we saw issues.

<br />
I think WC3 is a bad example, because the Horde story right now basically IS WC3's Arthas-Story. If you had to pick a faction in WC3 and not play all of them linearily to see the story, the reactions would have been exactly as bad as they are now in BFA. They just chose the wrong kind of story for a faction-based MMO.<br />
<br />
Just imagine you were forced to play only Horde in WC3. What would be your story for the entire major storyline of Arthas following the Scourge and falling to it? Right, you would sit on a boat doing nothing. Which is EXACTLY what the Alliance story feels like this expansion, as Sylvanas is Arthas.<br />
<br />
It just does not work. In an MMORPG you do not just play everything and when the story of one faction is non-existant for a while (=10 years) you just say &quot;Well, i would really like to play Alliance, but since the story is on the Horde side right now, no biggy! I'm sure 10 years from now they will eventually get around to telling more Alliance stories and until then i will just play that Horde character i don#t really give a fuck about!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2019-01-10, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only meaning the Saurfang choice has is a toy, if I recall the discussion and posts about it. And, the whole thing came about last minute, because of their piss poor writing that put a character players are invested in, into a bad place in the story. The whole &quot;meaningful choices&quot; is nonsense. It can't work in a game like WOW. Every player gets the same ride, no matter what. This isn't Fallout 1, this is WoW: The Dark Ride. <br />
<br />
Besides, they're not writing a novel, it's fan service most of the time - and that's fine for a video game, but they're patting themselves on the back a little to hard here. But that's typical for the WOW team, these days. They're always making statements like &quot;You'll find out what it means to be....&quot; - and then never actually DO that. The whole story is unfocused and scattered because they're tunnel visioning on smaller aspects and stories, and letting the big picture fall apart. If you can't sell the faction war - and they haven't - then all of this is diluted as a result. <br />
<br />
And, they really need to not call these Q&amp;A's. It wasn't. Players have specific expectations of what a Q&amp;A is from Blizzcon, and this isn't even in the same category as the Lore Q&amp;As at Blizzcon - which is where a lot of the disappointment is coming from. This is a &quot;where are we now in the story?&quot; presentation - which is fine, but it should have been labeled as such.<br />
<br />
But, you know, these Indy companies, they learn as they go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly what I mean, though; that is a BRAND-NEW development. In WC3, it's true that Dwarves and High Elves fell under the banner of &quot;the Alliance&quot;, but in Vanilla WoW, it was established pretty early on that each Race was governing itself. Hell, Ironforge was the only capital with an Auction House for how many years?<br />
<br />
You first saw the seeds being planted at the start of Wrath, but Cataclysm is when you saw the proliferation of the &quot;Alliance military&quot; being a copy-paste of the US military structure, completely regardless of race.<br />
<br />
Conversely, the Horde has always been &quot;under the thumb&quot; of the current Warchief. On a PERSONAL level, Thrall was pretty relaxed, but make no mistake; Garrosh was acting completely within his right as Warchief throughout everything. And true to form, he was overthrown by who would become the next Warchief. But the Horde is not about &quot;maintaining our differences&quot;, and PARTICULARLY isn't true under Sylvanas.</div></div><hr />

Especially when you consider these are the same guys who built up Grommash as a genocidal ass in WoD, just to brush his ENTIRE story to the side and let him join the good guys in the end with no repercussions for ANYTHING he did.<br />

I suppose Grommash eventually got what was coming to him, it just took the Draenei 30 some-odd years. They used the Orcs to help them rid Draenor of any demonic corruption, and then they turned on the Orcs. Not with genocide of course, the Draenei wouldn't lower themselves like the Orcs had, but with a choice: join or perish. <br />
<br />
And so, some Orcs joined, but the majority perished. A sizable few escaped to Azeroth, but in time they will face justice. Grommash paid for his crimes and Yrel planted a hammer firmly in his forehead.</div></div><hr />

Something deep and meaningful like, let's band together against the Old Gods ?<br />

They said that Garrosh is going to die in SoO, but that didn't happen. (interview in chinese Q&amp;A or something like that, it's official because it was from the people from Blizzard, it's on youtube)<br />

My speculation: they knew MoP was a good expansion, so they used a filler one(WoD) to prolong the game.<br />

The in game story is planned out months and sometimes years in advance.<br />
Cinematics have always functioned as an important point in a story in Blizzard games' history, and it started with the Wrathgate in WoW.<br />
The game can create good ambient story, but cinematics shine in telling the more emotional story points.<br />
<br />
Cinematics, music and art design are currently the only top-notch stuff of the game. Please Blizzard, don't let these people go, they are awesome. (I don't feel the same way about Ion LOL)<br />
<br />
Customization<br />
The night warrior customization was a way for players to support Tyrande's transformation and vengeance for Teldrassil.<br />
Golden eyed Blood Elves was a story choice to represent the light's role in the cleansing of the Sunwell.<br />
<br />
I love new costumizations, which is probably one of the few things they did well in Battle for Azeroth. <br />
My Night Elf druid as gone full Elune, while my Blood Elf priest has infused itself in the Sunwell's light. :)<br />
<br />
Love the racial heritages as well! I wish getting the heritages from allied races wasn't such a pain in the a%$&amp; to acquire... They should be acquired like the Dwarf and Blood Elf ones are today.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: I won't forget your promise about the Grand Finale for Battle for Azeroth ... but i'm sure i'll be disappointed again lol<br />

<br />
Yes I do. The tons of unanswered questions in the game right now makes perfect sense, as it did in any expansion before.<br />
When you read a book (or watch a movie), you don't really go out of the books/movies context. Meaning, you can't read (watch) about things that are not the focus of the story. That being said, if it's not part of the story they want to tell, then it is not. It is a completely another focus of the story they want to say and because it isn't the one you are interested in, that doesn't make it a bullshit story.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, your kin is genocided, your capital destroyed and you are content with some cosmetic crap as &quot;vengeance&quot;? You gotta be kidding me, right?<br />
<br />
The only retribution acceptable for the slaughter of the nelves and the destruction of Darnassus is Sylvanas and her toyboy getting skinned alive, tortured, chopped up, impaled and their intestines hanged on the gates of New Darnassus.

LOL, while that would be fun, it would require time for Blizzard to do cut scenes, and annoy Sylvanas fans, so not coming anytime soon.<br />

So the genocide on their kin and the destruction of their capital did not annoy nelf players and fans? Seemed ok for the devs to antagonize the players of the 3rd most popular player race now, didn't it. And apparently they enjoy cruelty alot, so what's the fuzz?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sigxy the Lemming</div><div class="date">2019-01-11, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think WC3 is a bad example, because the Horde story right now basically IS WC3's Arthas-Story. If you had to pick a faction in WC3 and not play all of them linearily to see the story, the reactions would have been exactly as bad as they are now in BFA. They just chose the wrong kind of story for a faction-based MMO.<br />
<br />
Just imagine you were forced to play only Horde in WC3. What would be your story for the entire major storyline of Arthas following the Scourge and falling to it? Right, you would sit on a boat doing nothing. Which is EXACTLY what the Alliance story feels like this expansion, as Sylvanas is Arthas.<br />
<br />
It just does not work. In an MMORPG you do not just play everything and when the story of one faction is non-existant for a while (=10 years) you just say &quot;Well, i would really like to play Alliance, but since the story is on the Horde side right now, no biggy! I'm sure 10 years from now they will eventually get around to telling more Alliance stories and until then i will just play that Horde character i don#t really give a fuck about!&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know, man. People love the story in WC3 from what I understand. While I get what you mean, here's one important thing with the WC3 story which BfA is trying to do, which is what you mentioned doesn't work in an MMORPG: How much of the story in WC3 was actually focused on the &quot;Horde vs Alliance&quot;...?<br />
<br />
The tutorial had some Horde vs Alliance, that was one level. We saw a little tad bit of it on the &quot;Official custom campaign&quot; where the Orcs met the Trolls. The Human Arthas campaign didn't have any Horde vs Alliance since it was more about the Blackrock Clan only. Orc campaign had like one mission before they became buddies (Orcs vs Night Elves doesn't count as they weren't Alliance yet). Then we got Rexxar's Campaign which is half Horde vs alliance and closest we got to it... funny enough, that thing was ALSO about bringing the Horde together, haven't seen THAT done before.<br />
<br />
Faction stories are boring and overdone. The story has told several times the Horde and Alliance NEEDS to work together to save Azeroth repeatedly. They can't be done in an MMORPG when both sides play them. You can't get any satisfying results from it for both sides.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, your kin is genocided, your capital destroyed and you are content with some cosmetic crap as &quot;vengeance&quot;? You gotta be kidding me, right?<br />
<br />
The only retribution acceptable for the slaughter of the nelves and the destruction of Darnassus is Sylvanas and her toyboy getting skinned alive, tortured, chopped up, impaled and their intestines hanged on the gates of New Darnassus. THAT would be vengeance. Everything else is just another insult for the nelves.<br />
<br />
Problem is that this won't happen... and let's be really honest here: If it comes to that and we DO get rid of Sylvanas and her boytoy, do you honestly think the NIGHT ELVES gets to do it? No, it'd be the humans. Because you Night Elves can't succeed at anything without humans helping out like always according to Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, apparently these two clowns don't even know Tyrande and Malfurion go way back to the Warcraft series, too, and have seen MUCH more than Saurfang... this is idiotic.<br />
<br />
This whole live stream reeked of Horde bias so much you have to really consider they are deliberately trying to get rid of one part of the player base.</div></div><hr />

We might help her in Nazmir, but if Blizzard pulls a Saurfang on Talanji, the Horde needs to sever all ties to her and stand by Rastakhan..<br />

So because you don't like WoW's story, it should not be there?<br />
<br />
Seriously, WoW is the only story I've ever been this involved with. If anything, I want even more story added. It has so much potential, and so many directions to go. It's spot on in my case.</div></div><hr />

Remember when J K Rowling and George R R Martin became awful writers when they did something the fans didn't like? No. Exactly.<br />
<br />
I had to balk at this comment, because Rowling is famously regarded as a scumbag nowadays for not stopping at book seven and trying to milk her series for woke points, and even the usual whales arent having it. So yes, she is regarded as a writer who was not but is now bad because she did something the fans dont like. <br />

Right, like how they answered the questions of why Grommash is on our side, or how timelines work, or why there isn't an alt-Argus/Archimonde?<br />
<br />
Lore skimping is what killed WoD for me, I like lore and I like reasons for things happening beyond &quot;Draenor is freeeeee!&quot;<br />

Feel free to have your opinion. For me personally, FF XIV blows current WoW out of the water. More fun Class design, more engaging storytelling, especially the expansions; Heavensward and Stormblood, the freedom of activity, the lack of RNG-Inception, more engaging music, especially on many boss fights. My guess is you haven't even finished Realm Reborn.</div></div><hr />

I've finished it but for some reason I couldn't get engaged as other people. The game feels too instanced at times, it had some good moments but that's actually how I'd describe the game. I love Dragoons though, the classes were well thought out.</div></div><hr />
