New Character Creation Screen<br />
Each faction now uses the same background when creating a character, with Horde and Pandaren being updated so far. Alliance (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/may/alliancecc.jpg) is currently using the default generic background, but you can expect an update for them in the future. The selection screens also zoom in to make changing facial details easier, but some camera positions still need to be corrected. <br />
<br />
Character selection screens are also starting to see updates, with Human and Tauren characters being the first to receive a new background.<br />

Thrall: Not the New Warchief?<br />
Erm...He's (Thrall) going back to being Warchief of the Horde. Which apparently isn't supposed to bother all the Alliance that have been working with him for the last few years.<br />
<br />
I know what was said during the press tour, but don't be so sure yet that you know who the next warchief will be. The information provided during the press tour was... not entirely accurate.<br />

MoP Pet Battle System is Complete Overkill?<br />
And for what? Vanity? Just pure vanity?<br />
For fun. We're adding something new to the game we think a large number of players will enjoy given its accessibility.<br />
<br />
You could've worked on character models. You could've worked on more battlegrounds, dungeons, raids, and arenas.<br />
By and large you're not talking at all about the same developers/artists/programmers. The development team isn't just a pool of people, all with the exact same skill sets. That's too big an assumption on your part with regard to what could've been created in the absence of pet battles, not to mention whether or not the payoff would actually be better if development resources were dedicated to other projects.<br />
<br />
Pet collectors will be the only WoW players mutually interested in this.<br />
We'll see. That's a bold claim.<br />
<br />
Now that you've added it, it's going to be continually updated, continually wasting hours, and continually voiding the biggest issues with this game.<br />
You're entitled to your opinion and we're listening, but you don't decide for the general WoW population what are the biggest issues with the game, nor are you attuned to our production schedule and how resources are distributed to various projects within the design department. Bold claims AND big assumptions.<br />
<br />
It would be great if you polled us with a simple question like this: &quot;Should we spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on this silly vanity idea?&quot; before taking the initiative to do it. Please do that next time, I guarantee my soul the results will shock you.<br />
We absolutely want to make the best game possible and want people to love it. The means to that end, however, isn't design by democracy. Aside from finding and fixing bugs, there's a reason why we have beta tests. We can't just write a list of feature descriptions down on paper, put them up for a vote, and expect to obtain the best actionable development ideas (yes, even if we framed the questions to be just a little more fair than your example). <br />
<br />
We create. You play. You provide feedback. We iterate. <br />
<br />
P.S. You're going off of bits and pieces of information datamined from the beta. The system isn't even live yet and we have a lot more information coming to explain how we want it to work. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/222177-mop-pet-battle-system-is-complete-overkill/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4768347221?page=9#169))<br />
<br />
Why the lack of Patch Notes?<br />
We tend to iterate pretty quickly during beta. It's a luxury we don't have when we're making patches to the live game. We can use beta to try some crazy ideas and then quickly back them out again if we don't like the way they are going.<br />
<br />
Closely related, because we want to iterate on beta quickly, we don't all sit down together and agree on when is the best time to make a beta push. Usually we try to stabilize things for a little bit to make the build, but even then, you're going to see a lot of things that are half-implemented, not quite working yet, or in the process of being backed out because someone realized it was a bad idea.<br />
<br />
We understand our betas can be a confusing, bewildering and sometimes frustrating experience. They aren't for everyone. Betas are emphatically not demos. Unless you're really good at looking past all the baling wire and duct tape, it can be hard to get an impression of how the final product will be. Also keep in mind that it's not just the designers who are testing things out, and sadly testing out new code is even less glamorous than testing out new features.<br />
<br />
On the topic of account level mounts, we are still evolving our design philosophy, so it's a great thing upon which to offer feedback. We have heard from some players who are thrilled that they don't need to play their &quot;mounty&quot; character to the exclusion of their other characters. We have heard from others who feel like their accomplishments are watered down since they got so many mounts &quot;for free.&quot; We're not sure which mounts will be account-level or not. It's weird to have paladin, warlock and DK mounts shared across classes, so there's a good bet those still be character only. What about the others? Let us know what you think.<br />
<br />
That philosophy goes for a lot of features. We're all busy working on the game, so we don't have a ton of bandwidth to continually explain our design intent on all of the various features in the beta (keeping in mind that our intent often changes). We'll try to hit some major philosophical points when we can, but if you need a lot of blue explanation or direction for how to beta test in order to get anything out of it, then I can understand why it might be a frustrating experience.<br />
<br />
My advice is just to play and let us know how things feel. If we haven't changed a feature in awhile, it could mean that we're happy with how it is, but it could also mean we're just working on other features at the moment. We'll read all of your feedback, but we probably won't have a lot of opportunities to respond. Rest assured that what you say is really important to us and to the development process.

Why is Wow's in-game music so terrible?<br />
This topic title makes me sad. <br />
<br />
We put a lot of effort into our music. If you actually go through it (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/music/) and listen you'll find a much broader breadth of styles than you might notice in the game. There are a few photos available via that link as well that provide just a glimpse of the recording and mixing processes. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/222152-why-is-wows-in-game-music-so-terrible/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4846824945?page=3#58))<br />
<br />
PvP and bringing the &quot;War&quot; back in World of Warcraft<br />
We like specifics. We like hearing about your own personal experiences. We like hearing what you like personally (or dislike). We like hearing your feedback. That's more valuable than attacking someone else for their play style or opinions.<br />
<br />
Why do PVP players have to be subject to restrictions on pvp realms due to the wants and desires of people who play on pve realms?<br />
The reason (in part) those restrictions have been there is more about development and the additional difficulties that occur in trying to separate the two types of realms too much. You end up (essentially) developing two separate games. That's not what we want to do. If the rule sets diverged too much, that's what we would have ended up with. That's not to say that if we don't have the opportunity or a means to make that less painful on the development team, we won't do it (within reason.) <br />
<br />
I'd love to say that all PvPers want the same thing from PvP, but that's not true either. I could talk to ten different people and be told 10 different goals and desires. Some love world PvP. Others won't take part in it unless they know there is some reward for being the victor. Some won't take part if the odds are stacked against them. Others will take part for exactly that reason. They want to prove they can overcome those odds. <br />
<br />
To do an analogy (albeit perhaps a weak one), it's like ice cream. All ice cream has similar properties and you'd think that everyone that likes ice cream likes all ice cream. But we know that's not true. People like various kinds of ice cream and dislike various types. So, how do you serve a flavor everyone likes to some degree? That's an oversimplification, but it stands to reason that you have to find something relatively neutral that has the potential to appeal to as many people as possible. You can add in some additional toppings to spice it up as an option for those that want more out of their ice cream.<br />
<br />
This is why I'll probably unsubscribe when MoP comes. I hate PVP, I hate being endlessly ganked and graveyard camped and I have better things to do with my time. So, enjoy your design philosophy, because I'm outa here.<br />
Whether you choose to continue to play or purchase Mists of Pandaria is up to you. I'd suggest waiting until you see/hear about the plans first before making any decisions. As I've tried to emphasize, we are working toward making sure we ameliorate your fears as someone who isn't interested in PvP. I think though, that you're putting the cart before the horse in this case and assuming the worst, much the same as those who are on the PvP side of the fence. We haven't even fully discussed the details of the design philosophy with you as of yet for you to dislike it.

Mogu'shan Palace Corpse Run<br />
There's an NPC in Dawnblossom (he's the Mogu who looks horribly out of place) that will teleport you to Mogu'shan Palace even if you are a ghost.

Holy Concentration: what's the plan?<br />
It's not the number of mechanics that is important (so long as everyone has sufficient flexibility). What is most important is what is the overall mana per time regen that the various healers have, taking into account all of their various mana regen systems (and including factors such as paladins casting several mana-free spells).<br />
<br />
If you think one healer is struggling for mana compared to another, let us know. One mechanic we are still adjusting a lot is Rapture, because we want to make sure that the worst-case mana regen scenario for Disc still isn't all that bad.

Personally, I can't wait. Even if the battle system was pure vanity .. isn't that exactly what pets are entirely? And mounts for that matter? And the look of weapons and armor? The way a legendary weapon looks is entirely vanity! The 100+ types of mounts are entirely vanity! I don't see the big problem with Pet Battles being purely &quot;vanity&quot;. I'm not even a pet collector but I do have a good number of pets .. and finally I get a use for them. Waiting for my raid to start in 30 minutes? Or just waiting for our 5 minute break to end? I can throw down my pet to battle someone. I understand that Pet Battles aren't &quot;hardcore&quot; for people. Or that they don't have &quot;end game&quot; cred. But complaining that they're adding a feature that you don't like is senseless.</div></div><hr />

We absolutely want to make the best game possible and want people to love it. The means to that end, however, isn't design by democracy. Aside from finding and fixing bugs, there's a reason why we have beta tests. We can't just write a list of feature descriptions down on paper, put them up for a vote, and expect to obtain the best actionable development ideas (yes, even if we framed the questions to be just a little more fair than your example). <br />

They do listen to players; within reason and to a point. Just because they don't acknowledge every little thing they might have changed due to feedback doesn't mean they aren't listening.<br />

For example, I personally dont think I'll be interested in this new feature, but I remain curious about how it will evolve.<br />

I guess that Zharym felt like grabbing some idiots by the noses and gave them a good shake/tweak.<br />
<br />
But the one post where the guy was whining about Pet Battles? After Zharym did that swat-down of the OP, some white knight waltzed in and tried to defend the &quot;Stop allocating resources towards Pet Battles&quot; argument by whining that people would rather have Black Temple/Ulduar instead of Pet Battles.<br />

&quot;Yes, I would like to have a raid that takes a normal/sane raiding guild 6 hours to clear instead of content developed by a completely different team of developers.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ain't it a shame that we're going to get raids AND pet battles? Shucks, it's like Blizzard is trying to give us multiple things to do or something. What's up with that? /sarcasm<br />
<br />
Just the sheer nature of the &quot;if it's a feature I don't immediately see worth to it should NEVER BE PUT IN&quot; mentality of these dipshits. And what's worse if they actually do vote with their feet/money, they go off to other games and try to pull the exact same cry act.<br />

Just this week, people were getting upset that Nameplates finally got put into Rift (after nearly a year of development, apparently the Gamebryo game engine is dogshit for modifying).

and WHY focus their attention on a part of the game that never gets anything but flames anywho? For ever thing they do for Arena, PVP, Raids, etc, they get QQ tears from that very group how its not good enough, not long enough, not hard enough, to easy, to long the list of tears goes on and on and nothing they do is &quot;EVER&quot; good enough. <br />
<br />
Its about time they add something that is NOT end game content for the people who do not raid, hate PVP, and would like SOMETHING to do that isn't Max level only content. People complain they don't do enough different things and when they do they QQ its a remake, or its not what THEY Want to participate in. Well news flash, but there are more people in this game than just Raider, PVPers etc. Different strokes for different folks and this is just one more thing to do that isn't one of the normal every day grind fests to actually do. <br />
<br />
I actually feel sorry for blizzard. They are damned if they do, damned if they don't and I can almost bet you with 100% certainty that the second character models get updated, over half the people who will rage and threaten to quit because their Race got &quot;Screwed up&quot; will be the very same who screamed about getting them updated in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its pretty clue they want to promote the e-sport and protect the carebears from PvP in the world.....hence why World PvP has been dead for a long time in WoW. Plus their in-ability to make servers PvE or PvP its not &quot;developing two separate games&quot;</div></div><hr />

well, I dont really have anything against pet battles in general...<br />

But I would certainly prefer if they worked hard on and brought back Path of the Titans in some variation (and gave archeology polish changes and some meaning) than having pet battles. <br />

And really, if they DO listen to feedback, why was archeology craptastic whole expansion? Because that is IMHO one thing most of the people agree, that didnt work at all</div></div><hr />

I think the human one looks a little better actually, but only a little. The tauren one is definitely worse.

That's just not how programming works. Someone who does models and textures isn't necessarily an expert at bug squashing and vice versa.

<br />
Perhaps you should do some research into how game development works before you make sweeping generalizations like this.<br />
<br />
No, a developer who does mechanics design will NOT work on models, because they are not an artist. And no, that same person will NOT work on pvp balance, because they don't do number crunching and they don't have a feel for what number range works, what doesn't, etc.<br />
<br />
Game development in general is a very complex machine and each gear is specialized to work in one specific area. Taking a gear from one part of a clock and trying to shoehorn it into another doesn't make the clock run longer or better, it breaks it outright.<br />
<br />
<br />
And this is why blizzard is losing players.<br />
<br />

You're missing the part where literally every developer ever does this, MMO developers most of all. What do you expect them to do? <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys you know absolutely nothing about game development and what should work, we have 20+ years of experience, but we're leaving all of the development decisions up to you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Capcom tried to do that with Megaman Legends 3. Hardly anybody was interested enough in the prospect of a crowd-sourced AAA game, and those that were had really lofty/dumb ideas that would never actually work in a video game.<br />
<br />
The result? The game that fans had been waiting for over a decade for was canned.<br />
<br />
There is a reason that video game development is a degree, and also a career path. Because it's really damn hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Terrible terrible idea.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has almost universally ignored the suggestions of the original players of this game (beta through vanilla/bc), and this is where we are today. I can not count the amount of things brought up in PTR threads/feedback by players that blizz has blatantly ignored and pushed right along to release code. And not just opinionated things like the balance of a certain class/boss , but blatant stuff like broken skills/bugs. Or the countless times players have provided feedback such as &quot;This ability is a bit OP, if you nerf it maybe 5% it'll be balanced to everyone else, here are 1000 dps logs to show that&quot;, and then blizz responding by nerfing the ability 25-30%, then later buffing it 30-35%, then finally nerfing it down to that 5% below original the players first suggested.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's first major cop-out in wow was putting shaman and paladin in both factions. It was claimed as a lazy way of balancing the game, encouraged care-bear status between the two factions, and the &quot;lore&quot; they decided on to explain it was nothing less than horrible (Space Goats). It was an early sign of things to come, but no veteran of the game expected the amount of class homogenization, newbie-catering, &quot;popularization&quot; that the game has undergone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tamriilin</div><div class="date">2012-05-05, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard has almost universally ignored the suggestions of the original players of this game (beta through vanilla/bc), and this is where we are today. <br />
<br />
They have only ignored the suggestions of people who propose things that would be of great detriment to the game as a whole. Mechanically, aesthetically, and design-wise, I feel like the game is way better off now than it was in BC.<br />
<br />
I've never really understood the zeitgeist-type attitude towards vanilla or BC. Nostalgia does not (or should not) outweigh good design.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard's first major cop-out in wow was putting shaman and paladin in both factions. It was claimed as a lazy way of balancing the game, encouraged care-bear status between the two factions, and the &quot;lore&quot; they decided on to explain it was nothing less than horrible (Space Goats). <br />
<br />
Except that the classes are totally different and it was a way to balance the game. I don't understand why being able to play the class you want on the faction you want in a game like WoW is a bad thing. <br />
<br />
Also: The space goats were in warcraft lore long before Burning Crusade came about.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was an early sign of things to come, but no veteran of the game expected the amount of class homogenization, newbie-catering, &quot;popularization&quot; that the game has undergone.<br />
<br />
You toss around terms like &quot;class homogenization&quot; like it's some stigma that is to be avoided at all costs. I'd rather not have a game where people would almost always rather take x class over y class because their buffs are 5% more beneficial to the raid. That's terrible design.<br />
<br />
And this is coming from a shaman, who in Cata currently has no unique buffs that are better (in fact they are universally worse) than every other class' buffs.<br />
<br />
And, honestly, I can't really speak to all of the balance decisions and bugs that make it to release candidate because obviously I don't work for Blizzard. But what I will say is that developers always have a time and budget constraint that they are working against and some things inevitably just don't make it in. That's why there are hotfixes!<br />
<br />
And, not like it really matters (?), but keep in mind that I have been playing the game since shortly before release. I remember what it was like in vanilla and BC. I remember hunting for resist gear for specific dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hardcore players - will be raiding , min maxing, and will not worry about pet battles<br />
Casual players - will be doing dungeons , scenarios and quests pet battles etc.<br />
<br />
I just overlook the features I will not have time to do .<br />
Raiding comes first , I will be to busy leveling Both my toon and his professions then doing dungeons and heroics <br />
So I can get into raiding ASAP . I may try the pet thing when waiting for content</div></div><hr />

Oh, certainly not. Having one design team go work on other design projects is one thing; suggesting that somebody who works in coding could pick up modeling and immediately be proficient at it and not a bane to everyone they're working with is totally outlandish.</div></div><hr />

I love how Blizz spins that and make it sound like if they didn't make a pet battle system they would have a dev team sitting doing nothing because there is nothing else they can do. Sort of a weak answer to, what I see as, valid feedback. <br />
<br />
I think many players wonder why a ripoff mini game get so much work when they feel that other core aspects of the game is falling behind and the devs often repsond that they don't got the time to do cool stuff like class quest or sometimes even basic content.<br />

This is the funny part.. why do you think as soon as it was announced there were like a million posts saying ´omg, they are stealing pokemon´.. it is because pokemon is huge and addicting.<br />

I think people are severely underestimating how many people will be playing this constantly. I also see this developing into something that demolishes the current ´arena´ system as far as special events and pay-to-participate tournaments.</div></div><hr />

And don't feed me that you have different developers for this and that, those people certainly don't have &quot;pet battle specialization&quot;, they COULD have been working on models, pvp balance or whatever you can think of.<br />

so no other game can have any sort of pet battling? what if i make a game where the people of that world battle pets for sport? you can't say that because pokemon did it first (which i'm not even sure it did) that no other game can do it.<br />

Blizzard deserves any and all crap they get for pet battles. <br />
Don't forget that they, a multi-billion dollar company, are the ones that started using &quot;lack of resources&quot; as an excuse to do or not do things.<br />

<br />
I turned off in-game music about 2 weeks after the game launched. When you're playing a game where you have to repeat the same tasks over and over, the last thing you want is to hear the same music looping over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. I also rarely ever pay enough attention to hear the in-game music for any game, due to being too focused on, well, playing the game itself.<br />
<br />
And I don't see why Blizzard is creating more work for themselves. If they really want to go ahead and kill Garrosh, every single quest outside of Outlands and Northrend needs to be redone to remove Garrosh. This includes the Troll starting zone where Vol'jin has his little fit. No, it can't &quot;happen in the past&quot; because the current world is the present, it's not a separate area like Northrend or Outland. Unless every zone outside of Orgrimmar is now considered &quot;exploring the past&quot; or &quot;taking place in the past&quot;.</div></div><hr />

We'll see. That's a bold claim.<br />
<br />
Yep im a raider through and through (some pvp now and then, though normally not on my main) and im pretty damn interested in pet battles.<br />
Im also the person who levels in a day so he can get to end game as quick as possible.<br />
<br />
When will people understand that even if your only interested in one part of the game its always good when it feels like there's more that you could do if you chose to.<br />
For me i will probably only do pet battles while waiting for my raid group to get set up or in between that lfg/r group but that's better then just going afk in my opinion.<br />

It is exploring the past yes, when we went into the cataclysm a year in game had passed since the lich king died same happened for the other xpacs (More or less) and the same will happen for MoP.<br />
You may see a few changes here an there in quests but for the most part all that stuff is in the past in game.<br />
<br />
It's a little weird for new people but in my mind i remember what happened already in azaroth so going into tbc from cataclysm seems fine to me.<br />
Like i said a few tweaks here and there will happen but with the massive amount of time it took to redo azeroth i wouldn't expect a redo of the other continents any time soon.<br />
<br />
Whats in cataclysm is past in MoP but i am curios as to what they do about this stuff in the next xpac.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to point out that several of my friends and family members who left wow during Cata have returned for MoP, two of them came back BECAUSE of the pet battles (though one of those is a pet collector, I admit) and ALL my family members who play wow are over 18 and most are over 30 (I'm 50)<br />
<br />
People who are stating that pet battles are a waste of time and development resources, are obviously not speaking for everyone, though they certainly seem to be trying to make it sound like they do.<br />
<br />
Pet battles do not only appeal to kids. My husband and I are both well over 45 and we love the idea, as do most of our adult kids who play. Please.... just because YOU don't like the sound of something developed for MoP, don't assume the rest of us do not.

<br />
How so? They link to a full size image of both the old and the new backgrounds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pet battles did seem to have a large dedication of effort put towards it for basically being a do-nothing strip down of pokemon.<br />
<br />
While not all programmers are interchangeable I can almost guarantee none of their specialties were specifically &quot;vanity pet battle system creation&quot; and nothing else.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying Pet battles can't ever be added to WoW because it is purely useless but the amount of effort does seem to be unreasonable.<br />
<br />
My personal opinion is that WoW-Pokemon shouldn't be a thing, but Logic says that that much effort shouldn't of been awarded to it when there has been things people have been already asking for for years (Housing, New dances as promised, etc.) and better/useful inclusions.</div></div><hr />

The Pet Battles are mostly being handled by the UI team. While quest teams, art teams and terrain teams have a LOT to do when expansions come out, the UI team doesn't really have too much besides making sure pop-ups and panes work correctly. It stands to reason they might be put to work on something that essentially comes down to a UI centric mini-game that a lot of people have asked for in the past. They don't have the expertise to update models or create phased houses, but by golly, can they link an option panel to a journal!</div></div><hr />

As someone who has already quit WoW, I feel like I'm watching it slowly collapse under it's own weight. <br />
<br />
Onward to greener pastures with me. Probably Guild Wars 2.</div></div><hr />

I had thought that after the cataclysm debacle Blizzard would have learned their lesson. Instead they are doubling down with MoP. After playing in beta I was so disgusted with MoP and its &quot;more of the same&quot; approach that I uninstalled it and uninstalled WoW. Blizzard is milking the game at this point, nothing more. I saw the same thing happen in EQ1 but at least in EQ1 the xpac's released new progression features rather than gimicks. <br />
<br />
The time was never more ripe for a competitor to knock WoW off it's perch. Someone needs to step up and do that.</div></div><hr />

I agree, everything is always deflection to avoid actually taking responsibility and defensive BS.</div></div><hr />
