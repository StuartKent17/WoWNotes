FinalBoss - Paragon Interview<br />
FinalBoss (http://finalboss.tv/) had the chance to sit down and talk to Paragon (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/lightning-s-blade/Paragon) after their Highmaul world first. If you missed it on Sunday, the video is now up!<br />

WoWProgress Rules Change<br />
It appears that WoWProgress has added a new rule (http://www.wowprogress.com/post/163_Abusing_realm_transfers_-_2) for rankings going forward that will not include guilds that realm transfer to buy gear from the BMAH. <br />
<br />

Upcoming Garrison Outpost Hotfixes<br />
We’ve been working on a solution to the issues with swapping buildings that some players have reported. Tomorrow’s restarts will fix several issues, but there are two outstanding issues that will have to be corrected in a future hotfix. In the meantime, we want to make sure players are aware of the issues so that you can avoid them.<br />
<br />
Alliance players who changed outpost buildings in Spires of Arak prior to tomorrow's restarts will not be able to access the new building’s questline. Horde players who change outpost buildings in Talador will be unable to change their building a second time. The gold cost will be charged, but the building will instantly revert back.<br />
Aside from those two issues, we believe the fix applied with tomorrow’s restarts will resolve all other issues with changing outpost buildings. The outstanding issues will be fixed as soon as possible.<br />

Are you aware that the 25% chaos bolt pvp nerf introduced in 5.3 was never reverted even though resilience no longer exists?<br />
Untrue. It was reverted. We've tested it multiple times. But crit damage is reduced by 25% in PvP in WoD. Just buffed CB. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/544320974519558145))<br />

I was of the understanding that Blizz only wanted achievements that were achievable, hence introduction of Feats of Strength. now except the Ordos one. Very very frustrating, and I hope you understand <br />

I've never spoken to anyone who has received conquest from a gold box in BGs. This was supposed to be a feature of WOD.What's up?<br />
We had to remove it from boxes last minute. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/544352838139543552))<br />

Lore<br />
Hello, can you help get something settled? Is this (http://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Schools_of_Arcane_Magic_-_Enchantment) non-canon? And if it is canon, why is it canon? What I'm trying to ask is, Enchanting is called a School of the Arcane in this book, does this mean Enchanting is not a School of Fel? Items can be enchanted w/ Fel energy, so can Enchanters be those who use Fel energy to enchant stuff?<br />
Enchanting probably uses several magical disciplines. Didn't we have shadow enchants at one point? (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/544645996777447425))<br />
<br />
Where are the Shamans on Draenor? I play Alliance, so I'm sure it's a factor, but exposure to Shamanism is very limited thus far.<br />
The Draenei in this period hadn't learned shamanism yet. It was the broken draenei who turned to shamanism after their fall. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/544959502169026561))<br />

WCL can do the same thing by blacklisting exploiters. The threat of a ban for the shadow priest exploiters seemed to work anyway back in 6.0. Players don't have to care about the websites but since they choose to, they need to adhere to guidelines, or start their own. Going into T18, it might not be as big of a deal since you don't have the 2.5 weeks, and there might not be 2 raid instances, but we'll see. Still good to have that in place imo, but I think it'll be a non-issue, unless theres 2 tiers of loot again, in which case, yeah, one week is probably enough time to get ~30 pieces of loot from various servers.<br />

Not sure how he's going to monitor it though. Assuming he monitors their armories one by one, where does he draw the line? Seeing more raiders off server and acquiring more 695+ items than they have now? 10+ more? 20? Really up to him but everyone probably would have a different way or opinion on approaching it<br />
<br />
Basically if a US/EU guild wanted to try it, they could, it's a 3 day transfer cd. They'd need to clear mythic on Tues/Wed, transfer immediately, then come back asap so the cd is up for the next raid reset. That 3 day cd and the real money involved has been enough of a deterrent to keep it from happening elsewhere. China with their setup, you would have enough time to get to 695 most likely, considering what they accomplished in a couple of weeks. Not just the fact that it's cheap but they could visit more than one server a week because of the lack of a cooldown.</div></div><hr />

This makes no sense to me, the gear disparity should have proven to be a much bigger contributing factor this raid when everyone entered relatively undergeared. Once BRF opens up, the gap won't be as big. <br />
<br />
Style War should not be blamed for doing what they did, after all it all falls under &quot;fair game&quot; as it was permissible by Blizzard, but to deny that the system itself is flawed is ridiculous. You should not be allowed to participate under the same progression race when a substantial part of your gear is already equivalent to the difficulty setting that you're trying to clear.</div></div><hr />

I originally thought it was moot myself, but we still have until February for Foundry, so they might still even be getting 695/701 Foundry gear from the BMAH after they cleared it for the week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 guilds beat them as opposed to the unknown number of others that employed the same gearing tactics as the first two. It's completely untrue to say having such a staggering financial advantage, in both real (transfer cost) and in-game (gold transfer cap iirc) currency has no relevant impact. Just from a noncompetitive standpoint, getting an extra 1 or 2 bump in ilvl can make a huge difference in getting that first kill, and it'd be an outright lie to say any bump in ilvl won't compensate for (relative) poor skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But do you know the details? In the China region you can realm transfer as many times as you want with no cool down and each transfer costs a couple of dollars max using store credits. So basically they can hop from server to server acquiring gear. Can you do that in the US or EU? Well no because there is a cool down on transfers and they cost a lot more money. So there is a problem there for sure. It's perhaps not the guilds fault.. they're just using the services made available to them.. but it's not a fair race if one region can go around farming up lots and lots of gear whilst the other regions can't.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2014-12-23, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This makes no sense to me, the gear disparity should have proven to be a much bigger contributing factor this raid when everyone entered relatively undergeared.

You should not be allowed to participate under the same progression race when a substantial part of your gear is already equivalent to the difficulty setting that you're trying to clear.<br />
<br />
But it was actually that big factor, that's why they've got the 3rd place. Otherwise they would not get it.<br />
<br />
We're talking about Mythic BRF gear, it's the top gear of this entire Tier (and not even avaiable by &quot;normal means&quot;). The same way guilds killing other HM Mythic bosses, grabbing their mythic gear and comming back to have an easier time killing The Butcher. It did make a whole world of difference for who did it.<br />
<br />
It was fair game there, between their guilds in that region, but not fair with guilds from other regions. It's even worse than the common cry that it's not fair US (or EU, since it happened too) having it's servers up 1 day earlier than the others.<br />
<br />
Again, Mythic BRF gear is top tier gear. You can stomp Normal HM with Heroic HM gear, you can stomp Heroic HM with Mythic HM gear. You can even stomp one of these difficulties with their own gear. Why would an even better gear from Mythic BRF would not help that much to stomp Mythic HM????<br />
<br />
We can all be sure that all those pieces of BRF Mythic gear (that they will get even more until february, no way US/EU could get the same amount with their current transfer restrictions, unless with some extreme luck within their BMAH) will give them a damn good advantage over US/EU for BRF race.<br />
<br />
And yes, all this is Blizzard's fault. Can't imagine how the hell they allowed that to happen, it's was a total slack on their part for not coding it to restrict these items until BRF is open. This way I see no reason for BMAH to not sell T18 gear (other than not avaiable in the game files yet) before it's out.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
So what I'm saying is that despite this so called 'advantage', they are beatable. Meaning that the 'advantage' is irrelevant, and by extension so are the rules. Guilds will still get BRF gear. They wont stop. No one is denying that the system is flawed. Just that changing rules to suit one approach is lame.<br />
<br />
It's more like they're &quot;bad&quot; at it (not bad players since they did what most are still trying, but they're not as good as the others around their level). Not that the advantage is irrelevant since other guilds showed how good a few pieces of mythic HM gear is for beating Butcher and other bosses in the same raid lock.<br />
<br />
Unless they had the same rules for server transfer, that would be ok. The problem is that they don't.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;they&quot; meaning those that did not win, they are the only ones crying about style war, paragon dont give two whits about style war because paragon knows its skill that wins, not gear<br />
<br />
That would say those two guilds are made of stupid players that don't know that much about the game.<br />
<br />
They, even more than the others, know that ilvl makes a good advantage. That's why they farmed so much gear. That's why Paragon did so much to get every single bit of 670+ gear for each character (like 7 HC raids with only 3 main characters to focus all the gear).<br />
<br />
It's stupid to say what you said about them. The only reason they would not complain (wich they did) is that others alread did and they don't care because they won anyway and the joke is on the chineses for only a 3rd place wich so much advantage, wich does not mean they don't care about ilvl advantage since they use it themselves.</div></div><hr />

They are basicly lying themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
BMAH is just one thing, dont allow alts in mythic, and give a set amount of tries. a week.<br />
you dont kill the boss? well to fuckign bad for you that your guild sucks.<br />
<br />
This would also not make the game that much time.<br />
<br />
Somthing like they did in ICC but with fewer tries and tries that is tied to each boss encounter.<br />
<br />
this would also level the competition with guilds that have good players but do not have the luxury of taking a break of their job to play endlessly for some days now and then when every content comes out, and also it would mean skillcap would be higher, due to the reason of bigger playerpool = more ppl being able to compete about WF, being first inside the instance would effect it, but that is if you do IT CORRECT.<br />
<br />
that means mindless tries after tries would not grant you a kill this week.<br />
<br />
but guess what? all these hc guild would prolly run havoc becuse they know there is players out there better than them.<br />
that dont have the luxury of time that would outskill them tremendusly.<br />

So the BMAH is not the sole problem here or server switch.<br />
<br />
its the whole concept built around raiding wf.<br />
<br />
class swapping for every encounter with alts should not be allowed either. You should have a team, you go with that team.<br />
<br />
balance your raid around it, maybe allow one or two swaps? each reset at mythic. but no more.</div></div><hr />

Last expansion example but when we killed durumu the first week it was by the skin of our teeth with everyone alive. The next week people died and we beat enrage by almost 10 seconds. All from what was probably a 3-4 raid ilvl increase. By all accounts blizzard has increased gear scaling this time around so it increases the effect even more.<br />
<br />
Butcher at 678 is just not even the same fight. Morgok is more of an execution fight with very light DPS requirements. It does ease up on healer mana though since less adds means less raid wide damage. And it does make the bridge from second transition to p3 far easier since you are guaranteed to have the reaver dead before the elemental add spawns. We wiped at 7% on our first clean transition to p4. With 7 more ilvls the chance of that is much lower.<br />
<br />
Let's be honest though you can't blame style war for using the tools given to them, blizzard is the primary fault point here. Long ago they said that they did not think that the bmah would be a significant source of gear so it was ok. That clearly is not true in certain regions. To me wowprogress making a stipulation is like plugging a hole in your boat with a wine cork. Ideally blizzard would just give them a cooldown or something and it would be ok.<br />
<br />
Lastly I feel like this will be less of a problem in the next tier after brf. With no wait on the raid who is going to have time to transfer around when you could be raiding?</div></div><hr />

I realize they can do what they want with their own site, but it's clearly a bad decision because how will they track this for all of the raiding guilds? Blizzard allows this in game so it's not an illegal move from those guilds. Frowned upon to say the least, but so are a lot of other things raiders do to get world firsts. And what if a guild funnels one extra piece of BMAH gear than for instance Method and gets a world first? Is it because of that extra piece of gear? Hardly plausible. It's not a rule that can be policed well, so it's better to not implement it at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also the apis easily allow for tracking server transfers. Wowprogress is just trying to prevent extreme pay to win scenarios. The costs for transfers is way different between regions to the point it costs 5-10x the amount in NA. The cooldown is the biggest issue though, in brf no west guild can transfer during progression due to the 3d cd but CN guilds could</div></div><hr />

Once again the Chinese servers have an advantage. They have cheap and unrestricted transfer, took advantage of it had a shitload of extra gear because of it and still couldnt win.<br />
<br />
WOD also launched later in China and they had less time to prepare for raiding. You can't add bullshit rules to something that isn't that complicated. Either you kill the boss first or you do not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Technically speaking, Blizzard does not even have &quot;rules&quot; when it comes to the world first race. The race has been a community led effort and it's just observed by Blizzard but in no way do they dictate the rules (cuz there's no rule at all. Save of course for exploiting mechanics - that's a different story altogether.) WoWprogress however has been the de-facto leaderboard website for quite some time and it's the one used by most raiding guilds and manaflask when it comes to ranking.<br />
<br />
Sure you can completely ignore whatever they say and throw it out of the window, but majority of the raiding population treat WoWprogress as the go-to book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the transfer thing, TLDR is China only has to about 1.50 for their transfers and they have no transfer cd. It might seem weird that a 3rd party website like Wowprogress thinks they have some sort of leverage over how players approach World of Warcraft itself, but they do in that regard. WCL can do the same thing by blacklisting exploiters. The threat of a ban for the shadow priest exploiters seemed to work anyway back in 6.0. Players don't have to care about the websites but since they choose to, they need to adhere to guidelines, or start their own. Going into T18, it might not be as big of a deal since you don't have the 2.5 weeks, and there might not be 2 raid instances, but we'll see. Still good to have that in place imo, but I think it'll be a non-issue, unless theres 2 tiers of loot again, in which case, yeah, one week is probably enough time to get ~30 pieces of loot from various servers.<br />
<br />
TLDR: Don't think it's a big deal, but a good move imo<br />
<br />
Nah its not true, as previous poster said they have same CD and almost same cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure how to explain it if it just doesn't make sense to you, but to try to help by using a comparison, it's like a person being thrust into celebrity status because they can act very well, or can run really fast, or throw very well. It boils down to, the person being thrust into &quot;celebrity&quot; status is doing something that other folks enjoy watching, paying attention to, and keeping up with. But if those things don't interest you, it probably won't make sense why folks who are interested in it, consume the information, just know there are other folks out there that this does interest.</div></div><hr />

Real translation. Spending money should not affect the race and PAYING server trasnfers to 72 servers where in china they do not have a 3 day CD is something US cannot do. unless someone wants to drop 70k.... which for china at 1.5 dollars per transfer is like 140 dollars.<br />

Well, I think you answered your question.<br />
<br />
I think this post should be stickied, so more people understand what it's all about.<br />
<br />
They don't make 'universally accepted rules to use in the race', they just make their own website's rules. If you don't like what they do, you are free to use the alternative progression tracking websites, is simple as that. Note: the other 2 big WoW progression tracking websites (guildox and wowtrack) do not even include the chinese guild in their rankings. Perhaps it would have been better if wowprogress wasn't listing the chinese guilds either.<br />
<br />
The fact that after all these years wowprogres remained the top progression ranking website speaks for itself.<br />
<br />
The decissions Kernel (the website admin) has taken over the years were always supporting a fair competition. In this regard, it's worth mentioning the past &quot;controversial&quot; decissions dating from 2010 and 2012 respectively, both leading to a more fair competition: Faction change abusers will be banned (http://www.wowprogress.com/post/50_Faction_change_abusers_will_be_banned) and Abusing realm transfers (http://www.wowprogress.com/post/119_Abusing_realm_transfers)<br />
<br />
Do note that (as they say) they won't ban guilds that buy items from BMAH, but only those that transfer to other realms in order to buy items from BMAH, and then transfer back to continue the progression.</div></div><hr />

Full BoE gives you full heroic equivalent gear. Large guilds always fully deck themselves with the 2nd highest difficulty raid gear when entering the progression race via alt farming. This is to be expected. Get over yourself.<br />

All of those &quot;steroids&quot; you mentioned at limit give you a full 670 set, which is obtainable by farming the 2nd to highest difficulty raid. BMAH gives 701 gear. These are on completely different scale.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if troll or not. Just fyi, Style War had 78 BMAH Blackrock Foundry (ilvl 695+) items (http://i.imgur.com/mx3F8tF.jpg), for which they paid real money to server transfer (emphasis on real money).

Anything that is obtainable within the game can't be pay to win. Its just maximizing your possible performance through game mechanics (BoEs, Garrisons, alt gear funneling).<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree that Mythic gear should not be available from the BmAH and that Chinese guilds should not be allowed to bypass restrictions by just spamming server transfers, but the actual buying of gear from the BmAH because you have a lot of gold in game is not pay to win in the least.</div></div><hr />

They are basicly lying themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
BMAH is just one thing, dont allow alts in mythic, and give a set amount of tries. a week.<br />
you dont kill the boss? well to fuckign bad for you that your guild sucks.<br />
<br />
This would also not make the game that much time.<br />
<br />
Somthing like they did in ICC but with fewer tries and tries that is tied to each boss encounter.<br />
<br />
this would also level the competition with guilds that have good players but do not have the luxury of taking a break of their job to play endlessly for some days now and then when every content comes out, and also it would mean skillcap would be higher, due to the reason of bigger playerpool = more ppl being able to compete about WF, being first inside the instance would effect it, but that is if you do IT CORRECT.<br />
<br />
that means mindless tries after tries would not grant you a kill this week.<br />
<br />
but guess what? all these hc guild would prolly run havoc becuse they know there is players out there better than them.<br />
that dont have the luxury of time that would outskill them tremendusly.<br />
<br />
So the BMAH is not the sole problem here or server switch.<br />
<br />
its the whole concept built around raiding wf.<br />
<br />
class swapping for every encounter with alts should not be allowed either. You should have a team, you go with that team.<br />
<br />
balance your raid around it, maybe allow one or two swaps? each reset at mythic. but no more.<br />
<br />
This post pretty much sums the issue up. Esp bolded parts. Real money or no money, time or no time, its just about rules to play in one particular way which some people think is competitive or fun.

Next Engineer goggles could be eye patches. Give them those &quot;sci-fi door&quot; style apertures on the lens. You know, like on the air ducts in Alien 1, have them twist open and closed periodically. When near closed, it could stop, and make little laser beams come out and scan stuff. It would be a sweet animation. When the apertures open, it would be glass covered, same color as the beams, and could have scrolling text going up them, like its a communicator. Probably also good for knowing who has the over 9000 achievement. I bet they would be crazy popular.<br />
Next: paladin visuals. Diablo style angel wings for avenging wrath? throw a ghostly copy of your actual weapon for hammer of wrath? Final verdict glyph similar to bladed judgement glyph, with giant glowing spears, swords, and axes? Totally.<br />
Warrior: more thunder visuals, like a glyph of thundering charge, to compliment thunderclap, or make a thunderclap glyph, which makes it fire.<br />
Deathknight: ok I totally got this idea from watching Dogma, but you know the 3 demon Hockey guys? Remember how they use their weapons to slice a hole through reality, then go through the tear? That would be so cool if death gate were like that. So cool. Make a dramatic vertical slash, leaving a dark line in the air, which pulses evil, then splits open, letting out some chilly mist. Metal.<br />
More spells could travel on semi random corkscrewing anime missile style paths instead of strait there. (arcane missiles, talking about you)<br />
Here's one. When a caster unsheathes a weapon it doesn't go on their back as soon as you cast a spell, the caster uses the weapon as part of the spell. Like in the BC opener, when that blood elf lady raises the orc, and has the staff in hand still. That's a lofty one, but new animations for the limber new many boned models. Melee and caster alike. I'd be thrilled. And lastly ,speaking of bones, maybe maces that are like flails and morning stars, nunchakku for monks?</div></div><hr />
