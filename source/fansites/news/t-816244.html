MMO-Champion Guide Contest - Win a Mottled Drake and a Riding Turtle!<br />
After the ridiculously popular Facebook giveaways during the week-end, I came to the conclusion that my users like free stuff and I decided to kick it up a notch with a contest.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2010/december/prize.jpg<br />
<br />
Prizes<br />
All the TCG related prizes, including the mounts, are courtesy of WoWTCGLoot.com (http://www.wowtcgloot.com/) who was nice enough to send tons of awesome stuff my way. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1st Place - Mottled Drake (http://www.wowtcgloot.com/mottled_drake.htm) Flying Mount. It's brand new and still rare enough to make you the only player flying one on your server.<br />
2nd Place - Riding Turtle (http://www.wowtcgloot.com/riding_turtle.htm) Ground Mount. The cutest ground mount ever can be yours! <br />
3rd Place - Ethereal Portal (http://www.wowtcgloot.com/ethereal_portal.htm) An item replacing your Heartstone by an awesome Ethereal portal! <br />
4th Place - Companion Pet Pack #1 - World of Warcraft Pet: Lil Ragnaros (http://eu.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=221004437) + World of Warcraft® Pet: Moonkin Hatchling (http://eu.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=221004438)<br />
5th Place - Companion Pet Pack #2 - World of Warcraft® Pet: Pandaren Monk (http://eu.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=221003558) + World of Warcraft® Pet: Lil’ XT (http://eu.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=221003878)<br />
<br />
<br />
Your guide<br />
<br />
The only thing you have to do is to write the best guide you can! It can be anything, raid guide, auction house guide, profession guide, class guides, addons configuration guide, guide on how to make your level 1 alt look awesome, guide on how to tweak and optimize WoW, etc ... The possibilities are endless.<br />
Picking something original is nice, but keep in mind that the main purpose of a guide is to be helpful. Also keep in mind that it has to be related to WoW!!! <br />
I think any kind of content is allowed as long as it can go on the main page. Pictures will make anything better and I strongly suggest that you use them (and don't rush them on paint) but you can totally expand to videos or HTML/Javascript (keep it simple, please)<br />
If you plan to use HTML/Javascript you will have to host that part of your guide on your own site, I won't let you embed it on the forums for very obvious security reasons. <br />
If you need to upload images, use imgur.com (http://imgur.com/), they're nice. <br />
<br />
<br />
Contest Rules<br />
<br />
The contest starts as soon as this news post goes up and will end on Tuesday 28th December at 08:00PM GMT. <br />
Your guide has to be posted in the Guide Submission Forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/321-Guide-Submission). One entry per person.<br />
New content only - I have absolutely no way to check if you're the original author of a guide if you already posted it somewhere else. People caught cheating by stealing other people's work on other sites will be permanently banned from the forums. <br />
You are free to edit the content of your guide until the end of the contest, on Tuesday 28th December at 08:00PM GMT the forums will be locked and all the guides there will be reviewed. <br />
Other forum users can not see your guide and will not steal your ideas. To prevent any drama the guides are also hidden for moderators and global moderators and the only people who can see them are the Administrators (who aren't allowed to participate, obviously).<br />
The winners are the people who come up with the best guide. They will be announced shortly after the end of the contest and the winning guides will be published on the front page over the next few days. <br />
After all the winners have been announced and their guides published on the front page, the guides submission forum will become public and users will be free to check any of the guide submitted during the contest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck! <br />

Maloriak 25-Man Heroic World First Kill by Premonition<br />
Premonition (http://www.premoguild.com/forums/portal.php) (US - Sen'jin) was the first guild in the world to be the Slayers of Stupid, Incompetent, and Disappointing Minions. Congratulations to them! (And because you're all going to ask, yes, the title is temporary)<br />

Cataclysm Hotfixes - Updated Dec. 20<br />
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br />
<br />
December 20<br />

<br />
Cobra Shot is no longer refreshing the duration of the Wyvern Sting damage-over-time effect. Cobra Shot is correctly extending the damage-over-time effect applied by Serpent Sting.<br />
<br />
<br />

Conjuring refreshments no longer count toward achievements like Set the Oven to &quot;Cataclysmic&quot; and Time To Open A Restaurant.<br />
Impact is no longer applying damage-over-time effects to enemy targets who are not within line-of-sight of the original target. A target in line-of-sight with the original target is still affected appropriately, even if they are not in sight of the mage.<br />
<br />
<br />

Chakra is no longer consumed by a Prayer of Mending bounce.<br />

<br />
Bellows Slaves no longer grant reputation.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Grim Batol<br />
<br />
Quests for Grim Batol are now appropriately flagged as dungeon quests.<br />
<br />

<br />

Winged Steed of the Ebon Blade is no longer showing as available for purchase by any class but death knights.<br />

<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
The search radius to find an Archaeology node from the Archaeology ability Survey has been increased. This will result in fewer searches needed while in the &quot;green&quot; range of surveying.<br />
The Alchemy specialization Elixir Master was granting extra potion procs instead of Potion Master when used on Cataclysm level recipes. The potions found to be causing this have been fixed.<br />
Both Willful Ember Topaz and Lucent Ember Topaz no longer award skill past 515 Jewelcrafting skill. The designs still show as grey in the Profession window, but no longer award skill up to 525.<br />
Several cooking recipes were not counting toward the achievement Set the Oven to &quot;Cataclysmic&quot; and have been updated. Note that Darkbrew Lager, Highland Spirits, and Chocolate Cookie are not intended to count for this achievement.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
Killing a level 85 dwarf mage now properly updates the achievement criteria for Dwarf Slayer.<br />

If it's easier then hopefully blizzard will change things so it isn't.<br />

It's not a nerf, mate, it's a hotfix of an unintended encounter bug which people would never see if they were doing it right. If they were doing it wrong they were taking more damage sometimes. HURRRRR?<br />

I'm sorry Blizz, but from my point of view, there aren't any Dwarf mages in WoW.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dwbrown7680</div><div class="date">2010-12-21, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ensidia knows what they're doing. They can look around and see that every other world class guild that has been competing with them for world-firsts are still doing ALL their raids in 25m. So they are specifically chosing to do most of these (they got CoW in 25) on 10m knowing how it's going to look and how people are going to react. Most people are viewing it as them stepping back and not being able to hang with Paragon/Premonition and the like, which seems pretty apparent. If you really wanted to stay relevant and noteworthy, you could have gotten by with doing one on 10, but not 3 of 4 as they've done now.<br />
<br />
I personally find it hilarious, because while that guild is full of some amazing WoW players, people like Kungen with their attitudes ruin the perception of that guild making thousands upon thousands actively root against them. Grats to Premonition though, keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />

Actually that's an important fix for all hunters who don't want to buy some alcohol from the BRD barkeeper. Hunder abilities proc neither the bleed dot nor the spell reflect so there are only a few solutions:<br />
* Running to the boss and meleeing him. Cannot be intended as Hunters are not supposed to melee.<br />
* Using the PvP medaillon. PvE is not PvP and the cooldown is too high. So that's also not a proper solution<br />
* Drinking [[Sulfuron Slammer]] right before/during the paralyze cast. Works fine but requires an ancient item from another instance.<br />
* Getting paralyzed and having the healer dispel you as soon as he's out. That's could be the intended solution but it results in the healer wasting mana just because of the fact there's a hunter in the group. So I doubt that's what Blizzard wanted<br />
* Getting paralyzed, letting the debuff run out and being hit with 50k.</div></div><hr />

Or, getting hit with paralyze and waiting for it to time out. You're supposed to outrange the mechanic anyway, why would you be in range of it in the first place?</div></div><hr />

no brain, no pain<br />
<br />
Ensidia took down Omnotron Defense System HC in 10 man, hence they cant switch to Blackwing Descent 25 in this lockout<br />
Ensidia took down Conclave of Winds HC in 25 man, hence they can try Al'akir only in 25 man setup<br />
Ensidia took down Halfus HC in 10 man, hence they cant switch to Bastion of Trashlight 25 in this lockout<br />
<br />
heroic have their own special unflexible lockout, if u started with 10, u need to continue until the end of raid week (the same situation with 25)<br />

They can look around and see that every other world class guild that has been competing with them for world-firsts are still doing ALL their raids in 25m. So they are specifically chosing to do most of these (they got CoW in 25) on 10m knowing how it's going to look and how people are going to react. Most people are viewing it as them stepping back and not being able to hang with Paragon/Premonition and the like, which seems pretty apparent. If you really wanted to stay relevant and noteworthy, you could have gotten by with doing one on 10, but not 3 of 4 as they've done now.<br />
<br />
I personally find it hilarious, because while that guild is full of some amazing WoW players, people like Kungen with their attitudes ruin the perception of that guild making thousands upon thousands actively root against them. Grats to Premonition though, keep up the good work.<br />
Thousands? I think you overestimate the number of people who actually give a crap for any longer than it took them to read the announcement.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, and you have no idea how much I'd be down for this contest except for the fact that I have no idea what I'd make a guide about :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, after a bit of research, they CAN'T swich back to 25 man during this reset.<br />
<br />
Once you kill in heroic a boss, you can only keep on raiding with those numbers, ie: if you kill a boss in 25 man heroic, you can't 10 man heroic raid after that.<br />
<br />
So ensidia will have to keep on 10 man heroic raiding this week.<br />
<br />
SO basically, they probably f***ed up a bit by trying to kill the bosses too soon.</div></div><hr />

Have any of you read the actual boss abilities? Every boss ability hits for the exact same amount in both 10 and 25. Other than the amount of people in the raid, there is no difference aside from boss health. Sure, moving around 25 people is harder, but healing tanks with only 3 available healers (instead of 7) when shit hits the fan is harder as well. Apples and oranges.</div></div><hr />

I would be really careful comparing 10 to 25 nowadays. First and major adventage considers logistic aspects of leading a raiding guild (25 is simply harder). To compare it, u need to play both and see it yourself, i really doubt U did if ater 2 weeks of Cata. <br />
<br />
There was a post on Paragon forum considering this matter and it was like &quot;Al akir 10 - Lord Marrowgar HC, Al akir 25 - Lich King HC&quot;. But hey, U probably did not do any of those, so relax and enjoy the game ;)<br />

This.<br />
<br />
You also have to keep in mind, that doing these fights on the level that world first guilds are attempting them(not waiting to be in BiS gear), 25 man will always be harder than 10 man. Not saying that makes Ensidia's achievement less special for doing it in 10 mans (mad props to them for getting it) but doing these in 25 man would be much harder for reasons mentioned in the quote above and the fact that they usually always under-gear them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously tired of people thinking his paralyze can be out ranged, if you actually looked at the spell you would realize it's unlimited range, and whether you're right next to the boss (in which case you'll be killed by smash, which does have a range) or at the very beginning of the instance (which has happened to people who have zoned in during the boss fight) you WILL get paralyzed, and you will most likely die if it crits (which is what this fix is about). I've already had 3 dps rage-quit on this encounter (2 were spell-stealing mages taking the spell reflect) because I kept telling them paralyze can't be out ranged and they need to leave the spell reflect up on the boss so I can get a dot on myself to remove the paralyze so I can keep healing.<br />

<br />
Excuse me...but why are you writing this? Are you a member of Pararogon or another equally skilled and competing guild? From what I see, there are 19 guilds as purely 25 man in the top 20 and 1 guild that is 10 man. If 10 man were so much easier as you claim.... where are all the 10 man kills? Right..there are 8 10 man guilds with a heroic kill.<br />
<br />
So you have a guild that is 4/12 heroic, doesn't matter if it is 10 or 25 man and you call them &quot;just aweful&quot;? Well..at the same time Ensidia is also 1/12 in 25 man heroic.<br />
<br />
Your post is just pathetic. Can't you acknowledge skill, do you always have to bring stupid prejudices here?</div></div><hr />

Aside from a HM LK kill, I did every fight in the expansion in one form or another.<br />
<br />
Is the quoted ability some type of exception? The boss previews released here a while back all showed abilities hitting for the same amount.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LordSothe</div><div class="date">2010-12-21, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even if Blizz did manage to tune everything exactly the same in both 10 and 25 (which isn't as easy as it sounds) some fights are inherently going to be more difficult on one difficulty than the other. Look at ICC bosses, for example. Blood Queen Lana'thel would be harder on 25 because you have more people and the same amount of space for her air phase. <br />
<br />
And there's the inherent issues in the size difference anyway -If everyone has to perform perfectly to down it, then 25s will be harder since there's more people to mess up. If, however, you can get away with a mistake or two, losing a player on 25 is not as big a deal as losing someone on 10.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, and for those thinking 10 mans are easier...<br />
<br />
A) by losing a single player, the raid group loses 10% of it's performance, in a 25 man it's mere 4% performance loss<br />
B) you get less loot in 10 mans, which means that 25 man raiding guilds on a single person mathematically get more drops than a 10 man raiding guild<br />
<br />
This is before considering the mechanics of each encounter. Two advantages for 25 man guilds already, right off the bat.<br />

Actually 10man is harder than 25 since u have the same mechanics BUT if u lose 1 char in 10 man it will seriously affect ur raid on the other hand this is not the case in 25s ur raid can handle 3-5 ppl dead imo....plus Ensidia is still one of the best guilds in the world and is the best...its harder to maintain the title for long rather than getting there for the first time....</div></div><hr />

And there's more damage dealt in 25m, so the chance of those 3-5 people dying when the same 1-2 people would die in 10m is about the same. <br />

Reminder that 10m and 25m gear are identical now. So the gear issue is the same for 10m and 25m, and you can't overgear 10m by running 25m.<br />
<br />
The only people who really benefit from 25m are tanks, because you generally still only run with 2 tanks which gives them greater odds of getting loot in 25m. For DPS and healers, especially DPS, there may be more drops in 25m, but you also have a lot more competition for that gear, so the odds on loot probably isn't much better than 10m.</div></div><hr />

What he said is that you can give all the gear that drops in a 25 to those select 10 players that will be trying 10m heroic modes next week.<br />
<br />
Since ppl say that it is a significant amount of extra gear drop in a 25 run (but forget that there is 15 explayers there too), yes, you're kind of &quot;overgearing&quot; your 10m on the next week.<br />
<br />

Also Ensidia is embarassing themselves, I dont wanna get into 10m v 25m cata heroic difficulty because just like 100% of people here I dont have the experience to judge.

That really made me chuckle. How could &quot;burning through content faster than other people&quot; be considered an embarrassment?They switched to generally simplier 10mans unlike basicly all other world top guilds. Thanks to the Blizzard's &quot;dumbing down&quot; 10/25 are equal so they try to compete with 10man raids against the real ones, 25man.<br />

The only people embarrassing themselves here are the morons who, from the top of their 1/12 normal mode progression, try to spit on everything they can reach in order to exist.<br />

<br />
Or maybe they only have 10 really, really good people? That is the only way that 10 man is easier...In that you need less people online. Of course that's also less healers, less DPS overall so everyone of those 10 people have to be on top of their game, whereas in 25 mans you can still carry (except perhaps on heroic...But then you can't carry on 10 man heroic either)<br />

<br />
Out of the bosses I have done so far in both 10 and 25 man, 10 man has always been easier. It hasn't been faceroll easy like H LK 10 in comparison to H LK 25, but it is definitely easier to coordinate and significantly less hectic.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's so far though...Things could be different on other bosses.<br />

<br />
<br />
What if your top 10 players are world class and your worst five constantly don't get the mechanics of the fight correct? This is rather common in a typical guild. There is also less room to dodge mechanics and aoe's still have devastating effects on the group.<br />
<br />
Let me make an example. When Theralion casts the aoe debuff on a ranged ranged that doesn't move out and continues to pew pew, it's going to kill far more people at one time in 25 man than 10 man. Many of the mechanics in the fights I have done so far are like this.<br />
<br />
Plus if the tank dies, the tank dies. It doesn't matter who else is alive, if a brez isn't taken quickly enough, it's over.<br />
<br />
B) you get less loot in 10 mans, which means that 25 man raiding guilds on a single person mathematically get more drops than a 10 man raiding guild<br />
<br />
That would be false, the same amount of gear per person drops in both 10 and 25 man<br />
<br />
10raiders/2pieces = 1 piece for every 5 raiders<br />
25raiders/5pieces = 1 piece for every 5 raiders<br />

Have you done the fights on both 25 man and ten man? I worked on cho'gall on regular 10 man for 8 hours straight and still did not get a kill out of it. The next day was reset and we cleared back to it on 25 man and we managed to TWO SHOT it, and this was with 15 other people who had never done it before. I think it is very wrong to say every fight is easier on 10 man, because it isn't that way at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually that's an important fix for all hunters who don't want to buy some alcohol from the BRD barkeeper. Hunder abilities proc neither the bleed dot nor the spell reflect so there are only a few solutions:<br />
* Running to the boss and meleeing him. Cannot be intended as Hunters are not supposed to melee.<br />
* Using the PvP medaillon. PvE is not PvP and the cooldown is too high. So that's also not a proper solution<br />
* Drinking [[Sulfuron Slammer]] right before/during the paralyze cast. Works fine but requires an ancient item from another instance.<br />
* Getting paralyzed and having the healer dispel you as soon as he's out. That's could be the intended solution but it results in the healer wasting mana just because of the fact there's a hunter in the group. So I doubt that's what Blizzard wanted<br />
* Getting paralyzed, letting the debuff run out and being hit with 50k.<br />
<br />
Or, getting hit with paralyze and waiting for it to time out. You're supposed to outrange the mechanic anyway, why would you be in range of it in the first place?<br />
<br />
Did you make it clear in the first place?<br />
What does outranging ground slam have to do with paralyze being able to 1 shot a hunter or what a hunter can do while paralyze.</div></div><hr />

How to write a guild application.<br />
<br />
<br />
Want to join a guild? Well then this guide is for you! Your guild application should be like a skirt, long enough to cover the important parts but short enough to keep stuff interesting. A guild application is like a C.V., it tells the guild officers who you are and what you have done, so it has to be as good as possible, because generally you only have 1 chance.<br />
<br />
Tip #1: The most important thing is to find a guild that is suited for you.(good raiding times, 10/25, etc.)<br />
Tip #2: You want to start by going onto the guilds forums, and check out their ''Recruitment'' section and read all the stickies that are there.<br />
Tip #3: Read all of the stuff you have to cover in the application template, so you don't repeat yourself.<br />
Tip #4: We all know people lie on their guild applications, i can't stop you but i can help you do it right. Don't lie about stuff you can't back up. Don't tell them you're 25 years old if you still sound like a kid. If you didn't spend as much time as some of us on raiding, you can lie about what you did in previous expansions.(Don't lie about progress of the current expansion, just incase)<br />
Tip #5: When answering a question, answer it fully with precision but don't right a wall of text and try not to sound like an arse.<br />
Example: -Previous raiding experience: 11/12 ICC25 = GOOD!<br />
-Previous raiding experience: 11/12 ICC25 didnt kill LK cause my guild was so bad omg i h8 them = BAD!<br />
-Previous raiding experience: did most of ICC = BAD!<br />
Tip #6: Use colors and other type of stuff to show that you worked on your application(Italic/Bold/etc.), recruiters want to feel like you really c[/url]. comare about joining their guild.<br />
Tip #7: Get the best gems/enchants/glyphs and spec you can for your class/spec before applying, if you are not sure what to do, just go to Elitist Jerks<br />
<br />
This is how you should do an application. Don't copy paste this exact one, you want to follow that guilds application template. You can of course edit their template to make it a bit better to show you thought about your application, by exampled 'Previous raiding experience' you can seperate it in 4 parts(Vanilla/TBC/WotLK/Cata). Feel free to add fun stuff to make it seem like you're not boring, like smileys! Don't forget to double check your grammar.<br />

When did you start playing? 5 years ago.<br />
What is your previous raiding experience?Well,<br />
Vanilla: Everything up to 4/12 Naxx40 with &lt;Insert Guild Here&gt;<br />
TBC: Everything up to and including KJ pre-patch with &lt;Insert Guild Here&gt;<br />
WotLK: Didn't raid at the start, 11/12 HC ICC25 with &lt;Insert Guild Here&gt;<br />
Cataclysm: Haven't had the chance to raid yet<br />
(Leave out the guild name if it's a bad guild)<br />
What was the name of your previous guild?My last guild was &lt;Insert Guild Here&gt;<br />
Why did you leave your previous guild?(This is tricky, you don't want to lie, but you can not mention all the truth if you got kicked for whatever reason, an answer like this will not make you sound bad, will not insult your previous guild and you will not sound like an arse): I feel like i outgrew my previous guild, their objectives were not the same as mine, but this guild is suited for me.<br />
Do you have a mic?(say yes even if you don't have one, you will probaly not need to use it, but just incase you can get really cheap mics): Yes<br />
Do you have vent?(say yes, you can just DL it after): Yes<br />
Logs: if you have fight logs and they are good, just link them, recruiters love them, add the logs sub-section if it isn't in the template<br />
Why do you feel you would be a good addition to this guild?(now this is the part where you have to shine, include the important parts i cover in your application, they are written in green): I'm a friendly guy(/girl), and i always keep up to date with the current stuff i need to know. I read up about my class often on EJ and i do tests with Rawr, my gems and enchants are always the best possible because every little counts. (Recruiters love to hear this) What i hate most is turning up to a raid and not knowing the tactics for the bosses, i read up about them and i watch videos of the fight, i keep up to date with fights to see if there's any changes also.<br />
<br />
<br />
A bit more about myself(add this yourself if something similar is not in the template)<br />

Hey i'm from London and i love turtles. I enjoy playing football and rugby, but otherwise i like playing WoW in my spare time, just add whatever you want after this.<br />

Ensidia knows what they're doing. They can look around and see that every other world class guild that has been competing with them for world-firsts are still doing ALL their raids in 25m. So they are specifically chosing to do most of these (they got CoW in 25) on 10m knowing how it's going to look and how people are going to react. Most people are viewing it as them stepping back and not being able to hang with Paragon/Premonition and the like, which seems pretty apparent. If you really wanted to stay relevant and noteworthy, you could have gotten by with doing one on 10, but not 3 of 4 as they've done now.<br />
<br />
I personally find it hilarious, because while that guild is full of some amazing WoW players, people like Kungen with their attitudes ruin the perception of that guild making thousands upon thousands actively root against them. Grats to Premonition though, keep up the good work.<br />
