Ochre Skeletal Warhorse<br />
The Ochre Skeletal Warhorse (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/47101/ochre-skeletal-warhorse/) has been added to the game, most likely to balance the amount of mounts between races/factions. <br />

As i recall was Stripped Dawnsaber and Ocheas (spell wrong maybe) horse put in to balance so all Faction has samme among of mount, so sadly not think gonna see epic one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The whole point about the new tier is to show the difference between the factions as they fight through the coliseum and be chosen by Tirion Fordring of the task of taking down Arthas. You will get your OMG HOLY S@&amp;T looking armor coming 3.3 most likely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, the dragonhawk looks much, much different from the 100 mount one and the alliance hippogryph is pretty cool too.<br />
<br />
Me like....(oh, and just to piss the haters off...I hope we can buy tigers as horde one day...)</div></div><hr />

Ok now sirious... i hate it - the tier for pally look ok but DK in PALLY set (its sill pally tho its dark u know...) stupidity....<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd rather they spent time working on the patch and getting it up and running than have to delay things by designing, building, programming and implementing 30 different looking armor sets just for you graphic whores...<br />

There's an implication in that wording that the ability to gain the title and achievement will be removed in 3.2. <br />
<br />
I'm presuming that it was meant to say &quot;players who achieve&quot; or &quot;players who have achieved&quot;, but a clarification would be nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They are adding the Ravasaur mount in 3.2, about time after over 4 years of waiting though. Check the patchnotes for confirmation. <br />
<br />
Edit: And why is everyone bitching about the armor models, Blizzard has done it for years now. Remember AQ and SWP? I don't remember nearly as much QQ back then, and now it's even seperate for Horde and Alliance so it's more diverse than it used to be. Stop complaining or quit, you people are annoying.</div></div><hr />

Swift Alliance steed<br />
Swift Horde Wolf<br />
<br />
I bet these drop from those champions in the Argent Colliseum.<br />
<br />
<br />
Interesting thought, but I bet Alliance players will get the steed, and Horde players the wolf, which is logical assuming we don't loot the champions directly, but rather get a chest spawned by Tirion - otherwise, it would be the first wolf for Alliance players, while Horde players can get the new Argent Warhorse, which looks better anyway, plus there's the RaF zhevra, which is pretty close.</div></div><hr />

The birdmount is one goofy ass mount, straight up, even worse than raptor mounts. All the bobbing up and down. It's a wonder the characters don't get a 'motion sickness' debuff and hurl. The protodranks are awful too, it looks painful to watch them fly... anyway!<br />
<br />
Just my opinion!<br />

I'll keep my undead warhorse thanks! :)</div></div><hr />

when i think about it.. everyone is complaining &quot;achieving equip isn't worth it anymore&quot; because &quot;everyone runs around with it and you're nothing special(sic)&quot; (poor guy being nothing special buhu)<br />
-- so blizz said to themself &quot;hey then no one will notice if we actually make them run around in all the same cloths&quot; <br />
<br />
blizz should allow .. no FORCE designing armor by yourself, so you cannot complain that someone else looks same..but that would hurt account numbers because &lt;5% even know what it means to design a 3d model and &lt;0,5% can accomplish this in some decent fashion. but everything that counts is &quot;i don't claim i can do that - so i can complain that my 3 year old nephew could do it better..LAZZY BLIZZx&quot;</div></div><hr />

Unless you mean a replacement reward for the T7-level achievement, I don't think mounts with just a slightly different look than faction mounts would serve well for an endgame achievement.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Argent Crusade hands out uniforms, not gear that they found lying around on the ground somewhere. Because that is what most of the PvE gear is - stuff that was worn by other people who died. Here - uniforms. I like the concept.</div></div><hr />

Lets see.. why may they be the same. Maybe you are one of those retards who explain it all that its just &quot;uniforms&quot;? Well, let me tell you something.

<br />
The Ochre Skeletal Warhorse (epic) and Striped Dawnsabre (rare) have been added so that each faction now has 18 rare and 15 epic racial ground mounts.<br />
<br />
Post 3.2 the racial mounts will be as follows:<br />
Humans, Night Elves, Gnomes, Orcs, Forsaken and Blood elves each have 4 rare and 3 epic mounts.<br />
<br />
Draenei, Dwarfs, Troll and Tauren have 3 rare and 3 epic ground mounts.<br />
<br />
To make it even across the board, The Dwarfs, Draenei, Trolls and Tauren will have to be given a new rare ground mount each.<br />
<br />
That will probably be implemented before faction changes. It will make the race change a teeny bit less complicated.</div></div><hr />

That's kinda crap. I mean, on the surface it makes sense, but if you really ran with it, they wouldn't differentiate between Horde and Alliance. Horde and Alliance members of the Argent Crusade both wear the same armor, and lorewise Tirion is one of the few people smart enough to see a beyond petty squabbling and divisions like &quot;Horde&quot; versus &quot;Alliance&quot;... if that was really a lore goal, then there wouldn't be a faction division between the two, because you're going in armed by and allied with the Crusade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is really the first time Blizzard created a raid instance with the sole purpose of getting ready for another raid instance lorewise. I doubt they told you to go to Karazhan because you needed to get the armor there for Gruul and Magtheridon, and beyond small quests that required you to get attuned through Tempest Keep, I don't see much of a huge lore connection on going to TK and SSC and even Mt. Hyjal just to go to the Black Temple, beyond simply taking care of Illidan's trusted lieutenants.<br />
<br />
I think the Argent Crusade realizes that, at this point, there is quite a bit of hostility between the two factions, and making armor that differ between the two can create more conflict. However, I think they also realize that they can defeat the monsters in Icecrown if they're working on faction pride, too. They want to utilize that part, as well.<br />

makes perfect sense to me. for the Coliseum raids we are proving ourselves to be Soldiers of the Alliance for the upcomming assault on Icecrown Citadel(or horde if your a slimy turncoat :D). when we get to IC in the next major content patch after 3.2 it would make sense that we are dressed in our faction's battle uniform.<br />

<br />
it's always horses, tigers, rams, doggies, dinosaurs, robot chickens, and ostriches....<br />
<br />
it's not to much to ask that by now we could get AT-AT mounts. LAZY BILZZARD! ;D</div></div><hr />

Yes, because Blizzard is not leading gaming company with loads of money and designers who are getting paid for their job.. think dude, think. This patch is just one major recolor, even the mounts, nothing new except raptor pets.</div></div><hr />

Not really, actually. Both have red scale-like armor, but one is a bird, and the other a... what the heck is that, an armadillo?<br />
<br />
I rather think its look is a reference to the style used for Anzu (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=23035)/the Raven Lord (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=41252) mount, though more intricate:<br />

<br />
tho i doubt you will even see it aside from youtube video's anyways. so whats the problem?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These is a LAME excuse for the bad designs and lazyness of Blizzard. Just like for the pvp sets: &quot;Pvp sets are not fancy because if we started fancy you would be wearing thrall on the head&quot;. What season is it? And it is the same bullcrap.</div></div><hr />

I know that this isn't the right thread. But is there any offical 3.2 patch thread with release dates and things like that?
