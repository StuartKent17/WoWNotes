As an update to the original announcement, there will be two tiers of PvP weapons in Cataclysm. The lower tier weapons will correspond in quality to items found in the latest raid tier on normal difficulty and cost only Conquest Points. The higher tier weapons will correspond in quality to items found in the latest raid tier on Heroic difficulty and will have a minimum personal rating requirement in addition to costing Conquest Points. All of the highest-stat PvP armor, including shoulder and head pieces, will cost only Conquest Points and have no rating requirements.

<br />
I'm not sure what I think of this personally, but I thought that Conquest Points were supposed to be the 'gate' for casuals? The hard core PvPer's would be able to gear up quickly, while the people who just do it for fun would be much slower. The end results would be the same, you'd eventually be able to get the best gear if you tried, and without needing to do something you didn't want to do.<br />

<br />
I believe they meant with no personal ratings on weapons, that there will be some weapons available without ratings at the start. Unlike this expansion, where you had to raid to get weapons to start pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
lol?<br />
<br />
You essentially get 95% of the gear WITHOUT requiring a rating.<br />
<br />
It is ONLY the very very top end pvp weapons that require rating, equivalent to doing hardmode PvE.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dumsnut</div><div class="date">2010-04-29, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imo there should atleast be e-peen rating on shoulders too. It's the most &quot;noticable&quot; armorpiece and to have 1 tier lower shoulders and 4/5 current tier + t1 wep won't make enough difference for gear to overshadow skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's hypocrisy to attempt to &quot;balance&quot; PvP while letting some people have better gear than others, because balanced PvP innately requires equal levels of gear. Do you think anyone IRL would get away with claiming to want a fair boxing match while giving one of the guys prank boxing gloves and the other brass knuckles? The same pretty much applies here. Superior gear should NOT be what makes good players stand out in a competitive PvP environment, and I thought Blizzard had come to realise this.<br />
<br />
You are right in the sense that it's thankfully only the weapon, though. I just hope the iLevel difference won't be as significant as it's been in WotLK.</div></div><hr />

It won't be as ridiculous as WoTLK.<br />
<br />
-edit- You DO realise its only HIGH END weapons right? Most PvP weapons will not have a rating requirement.<br />
<br />
If someone was able to get to 2200 (example) for the rating required for the weapon... then they have already shown they have the skill and therefore deserve the weapoin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference being that when you do PvE hardmode, you fight PvE hardmode bosses every time. The same is not true of PvP.<br />
<br />
People with top-end, rated PvP gear will occasionally be pitted against people with the lower-end, unrated PvE gear, and it confers an inherent advantage. This advantage becomes more pronounced at the advent of a new season. With everyone's rating wiped and matches arranged essentially at random, people with the full set of rated gear from the previous season will plow through everyone else and skyrocket right back up to their previous rating. It's the equivalent of doing regular PvE encounters in hardmode gear.<br />
<br />
The end result is that the poor stay poor and the rich get richer. Those without the rated gear must continually break their fangs against the armor of those with the rated, grinding losses until they can acquire the rated themselves and compete on equal footing where class, team composition, and player skill are the only things that matter, which is what PvP is supposed to be about anyways.<br />
<br />
It's a vicious cycle, and a completely pointless one at that. The only thing their &quot;change&quot; is doing is making it easier to be one season behind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, No.<br />
<br />
They said the points you gained from previous season will be converted to lower end points. Allowing people to purchase the weapons with the lower end points and no longer with a requirement.<br />
<br />
That means the season will start fresh AS LONG as they have enough points.<br />
<br />
I think you need to read the original announcement again on how the points work.</div></div><hr />

Any advantage is still an advantage. Anyone who has immersed themselves in the world of competitive, high-end PvP knows that you scrap for every last single stat point of an advantage that you can get.<br />

If someone has the skill to get to 2200 (for example) on, let's assume, a completely level playing field gear-wise, then what exactly is the point of giving them an even more powerful weapon once they get there?

You could say the same about any sort of gear for Arena.<br />
<br />
How about they give you all rags and basic weapons that you HAVE to use if playing arena, that cannot be upgraded in any way?<br />

<br />
Gear is important no doubt, but not to the extend you are making it out to be. We are talking about weapons only and that's really not a big deal. PvE gear in PvP is, not the difference in PvP weapons. <br />

Maybe... it will depend on how much of an edge the weapons represent, and for some classes, this will have far more impact than others.<br />
<br />
The original problem with the way it works now, as stated by Blizzard, was that people who come in to the season late, find a better comp or otherwise step up their game, can't catch up because they're facing people in radically better gear at the top.<br />
<br />
This will only solve the problem if the delta in win/loss ratio due to upgrading from T1 to T2 is somewhere around 1 standard deviation in win/loss ratio. That is, if we can reasonably assume that a well (but not perfectly) played team with T1 weaps can beat a not as well (but not poorly) played team with T2 weaps, then this system will not prevent people with T1 stepping up to T2, though it will present a &quot;sound barrier&quot; that they have to cross to get them.<br />
<br />
When I played arena for a short time in 2s, my partner and I out-played just about everyone until we hit 13-1400. That was where we ran into the folks in Furious gear, and though we were blowing our cooldowns like clockwork and countering our opponents at every turn we could, the combination of an OK, but not great comp and the massive gearing plateau made it entirely unfun.<br />
<br />
I might go back to Arena if the T1-&gt;T2 gap is small enough that skill can overcome it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about they give you all rags and basic weapons that you HAVE to use if playing arena, that cannot be upgraded in any way?<br />
<br />
Considering that this is the way that Blizzard, professional, and event gaming tournaments all run (with a set pool of gear, of course, not necessarily rags), your sarcasm does you little credit. Other than pandering to gearmongers, I honestly don't know why they don't do it this way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking like you are a Roman Slave Gladiator?<br />
<br />
Would that make you happy?<br />
<br />
I doubt it.<br />
<br />
Actually, I care very little about appearance as far as PvP is concerned. I'm not saying that it's not nice to have aesthetically pleasing armor, but I wouldn't mind fighting in my skivvies as long as they had the necessary stats and were balanced against everyone else's underoos.<br />
<br />
<br />
That means the season will start fresh AS LONG as they have enough points.<br />
<br />
You're right, as long as you have a stockpile of points you could potentially start on equal footing at the beginning of a season. But from there it just turns right back into an arms race. The people who reach the higher ratings first get their better gear first and then enjoy an advantage until everyone catches up, which the advantage makes progressively harder to accomplish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Day one:<br />
<br />
Blizz: We remove rating for pvp items, because with rated bg ratings would be arbitrary and we didn't like how people felt they couldn't advance in PVP because of the ratings blocking them.<br />
<br />
Casuals: Hooray!! Finally on equal grounds with those elitist arena heroes.<br />
<br />
Elitist: QQ QQ QQ QQ QQ QQ QQ My e-peen is shrinking QQ QQ QQ QQ QQ QQ QQ<br />
<br />
Day two:<br />
<br />
Blizz: Because we cave in to massive QQ heroic T2 PVP weapons will now need rating.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
So if the elitist QQ some more by day 3 or 4 things will be exactly as in WOTLK.<br />
<br />
And Blizz says they don't cave in to QQ, lol less than 24 hours blizz!!! Less than 24 hours and you allready cave in to QQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's not true and you know it. They did imply that there would be SOMETHING that still had rating and it is inevitable. Highrated players have to have something for themselves. Learn to read before you post dude.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better players should gear up faster. They win more, they get more points, they get their shit first. It works the same way in PvE, as the best guilds clear shit faster, and gear up their raid much faster than a more casual guild that doesn't raid nearly as often.<br />
<br />
Also, it is ONE item. If skill is not enough to overcome this one single weapon, then maybe the skill wasn't there in the first place.</div></div><hr />

You could say the same about any sort of gear for Arena.<br />
<br />
How about they give you all rags and basic weapons that you HAVE to use if playing arena, that cannot be upgraded in any way?<br />
<br />
It's been suggested, but it doesn't work because people want the shiny.<br />
<br />
The concern, however, is that when you have to reach score X to get a good item, the players at score X have an advantage that isn't skill. Thus, unless everyone starts at exactly the same time, doesn't get better over time, doesn't change their comp, doesn't change their membership and doesn't play any more than anyone else, you have some who get to score X first by virtue of simply having been in the right place at the right time, not because they're better than the person at score X-1.<br />
<br />
Now, there are people who are really, really good. They'll blow the doors off of the lower ranks even with the delta in gearing because they're that much better than the people they're facing, and eventually meet up with a tier of players who have gotten all of the best gear already, and are simply squaring off on a talent-vs-talent basis.<br />
<br />
That just means that arena is a fair test of skill for the 10% of the player base that get to that point. It doesn't mean that it's a fair test of skill for the other 90% of participants whose ratings are dubious at best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WTF are you/they talking about?<br />
If they can't reach the ratings where they can buy current season gear in 5/5 relentless, wrathful offparts and a i232 weapon, they certainly did not &quot;find a better comp or otherwise step up their game&quot;. <br />
<br />
The only they should add to make it better is the prev. seasons, in this case Relentless T1 weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No, that's not the way it works. Comps change, patches break some comps and boost others mid-season, memberships of teams change, new teams are formed mid-season, people take vacations, etc.<br />
<br />
There are practically infinite reasons that a good team might lag a slightly worse team at some point in a season. The rating system entrenches that lead artificially.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, it is ONE item. If skill is not enough to overcome this one single weapon, then maybe the skill wasn't there in the first place.<br />
<br />
As I said before, we don't know numbers today (and it's potentially as many as 3 items, actually, depending on class). If T1-&gt;T2 is a small gap, then sure you should be able to overcome the bottom-ranked people in the next tier, even given a weapon advantage, unless you're right up against the natural rating of your team (e.g. where you would have ended up if there were no ratings requirements). But, if the gap is larger, then you might make it past the lower ratings hurdles, but you'll never cross the ones that are closer to your plateau.<br />

U can't give equal benefits to those that work more, and those that slack around. To make a more valid point, FIA wanted to make all the cars same<br />
in formula 1 so that the driver skill wins the race and not who has the faster car. The reason this didn't go thru is because some of the teams invest more in their engines, chassis design, break design and so on, they don't want to be restricted to let just call it noob level. if they went thru with their plan im sure most of those teams would back of and Formula 1 as we know it will be gone with them. <br />
<br />
And as for , like you put it why give ppl that reach 2000+ rating some reward that makes them even go higher, its to motivate them to be even better, or reach the same level next season. Why does the Champions league or the Super bowl or any other team in sports that wins a major competition get more cash? They surely have the best players, they don't need more good players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Math is not strong in this one.<br />
<br />
Look, it's simple. What you're saying is that if you're the best, the gearing plateaus won't stop you. That's painfully obvious, but the question isn't &quot;is the top-ranked slot achievable for the best team?&quot; The question is, &quot;does the ratings requirement system prevent good teams from achieving the rating they would have achieved without the ratings requirement. When your gear gives you a 5% advantage and you face a team that's 2% better than you, you win more often than you lose. That's the fundamental inequity of the system, and it scales beautifully. Weapon only gives you a 1% advantage? OK, so now you can beat a team that's 0.5% better than you. It means that if you're right up against a rating requirement plateau, you probably didn't deserve it, but you happened to get there first.</div></div><hr />

Rewarding does not equal giving an advantage. You could give out any number of things, including gold, pets, mounts, PvE gear, titles, etc. that would not give an advantage. Giving out the best PvP gear as a reward for PvP would be like giving the guy who won that F1 race last year a better car than everyone else has for this year and then proclaiming that he won this year due to skill. No, actually, you no longer know why he won because you changed a variable.<br />

As an update to the original announcement, there will be two tiers of PvP weapons in Cataclysm. The lower tier weapons will correspond in quality to items found in the latest raid tier on normal difficulty and cost only Conquest Points. The higher tier weapons will correspond in quality to items found in the latest raid tier on Heroic difficulty and will have a minimum personal rating requirement in addition to costing Conquest Points. All of the highest-stat PvP armor, including shoulder and head pieces, will cost only Conquest Points and have no rating requirements.

I like how they adopt a view point and then change it so quickly when certain players complain. &quot;Oh, I'm an elitist and having an exclusive mount, tabard and title aren't good enough.

Not everything is equal as you wanted to be i'm afraid. While it makes sense to have everyone in the same. If those examples were hard to comprehend, ill try with something different. In Counter Strike the wining team gets more resources and thus gaining better weapons faster. At some point both teams will be with same resources but by that time the team that got the first win or the first few wins will end in first place for that round. <br />
Of course there is the other variant, that they can do same as with wintergrasp, where if u fail to win an attack you gain benefits while the defending team losses some benefits</div></div><hr />

Listen to what you're saying. Here, let's try it in layman's terms:<br />
<br />
&quot;Here's a sharp stick. That guy over there has an iron sword. You can't fight him (well) until you have an iron sword too, so go get yourself an iron sword. By the way, in order to get the iron sword you either have to beat the guy that has the iron sword with your sharp stick or let him murder you for a few weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
How do you determine whether the man with the iron sword won because he is more skilled or because he is more technologically advanced? You might not care either way and be content simply to win, but in that case it ceases to be a competition between players.</div></div><hr />

Considering more then a fair share of us originally were asking them for two season old weapons (without rating) and would have been satisfied with them. Instead now we can still get all the most current gear and T1 weapons (if Cata were now this would be like getting ilvl 264 weapons &amp; gear).<br />

If anyone is beaten by that little bit of &quot;edge&quot; alone I guarantee it was the greater difference of skill not gear. Let the high rated players have their rewards, we still get close enough that it will be a contest of skill (as opposed to now - I can show you the typical difference between a ilvl 232 PVE weapon [which the majority of new PVP'ers use] and the Wrathful one, but I think you get the idea).<br />

The main &quot;complaint&quot; is that PVE has normal gear for almost everyone and heroic gear for the hard core raiders, so PVP should be able to at least keep two tiers of weapons. I agree and I'm not one of them.</div></div><hr />

being a hunter it was my case too. but if you have no luck with drops it comes handy. so i dont see why they should deny this opportunity, the merciless crossbow was pretty strong, it served me well in pve purposes till something actually better dropped...</div></div><hr />

You just proved my point right there. You are right that 99% of the time the players skills will be different or one will get a lucky break or whatever. In those cases the one with the better skill/luck will win. I am talking about stripping all that way to make sure you are comparing apples to apples. If you could make a computer simulation of a PVP match and set the skills to be equal, then I guarantee you the victor will be the one with the better gear. It makes a difference. It might not be as big of a difference as people like to think, but it makes a difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still don't agree on no rating for T1 though : /<br />
<br />
<br />
Why not, this makes it much more similar between pve and pvp.<br />
<br />
The lower tier items are up for grabs by pretty much anyone, which gives casuals an incentive to do the content. And gives people in general a good step in level.<br />
<br />
The higher tier items are for the more serious participants of either PvE or PvP.<br />
<br />
PvE has its normals and heroics. And seriously any guy fresh out of heroics can pretty much run all normal raids these days. Our realm is one of the worst when it comes to PvE progression (due to it being RP and it has a low pop), and even our realm has pugs that clear up to LK each week.<br />
<br />
PvP will have its T1 and T2, where T1 can be gained by anyone who sets a foot in pvp content for some time. T2 will remain for the more focused players that get a good rating.</div></div><hr />

Sormer, this system is a lot better than WotLK's, while having the weapon will make a small difference, it's still a lot better than the current PvP situation.<br />
<br />
[By the way, I think some of you should learn to read, Blizz said the weps would have a MINIMUM rating requirement, kinda like.. 1400s top. Unless they change it, you won't need to get to 2200s for the T2 wep.]<br />
<br />
<br />
My point is: if no gear besides T2 weapon has rating requirements, so then what is the point in buying T1 chest, head, etc. if T2 items are just slightly more expensive (conquest point wise that is).</div></div><hr />

It has nothing to do with e-peen, it's just a showcase that you're a serious PvP player, just like PvE players and their fancy titles.</div></div><hr />

But, they're still offering a weapon without rating. So, people will still flock to arena, win where they can and pick up that weapon when they have enough points. Which, I'm sure, most people will do because they know they'll get a weapon versus waiting for one to drop in a dungeon/raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well I am not entirely sure about that. Say the ilvl scheme stays the same (which is reasonable since we have same loot for 10/25mans). This means:<br />
T11 Normal Raid/PvP: x+0<br />
T11 Heroic Raid/PvP: x+13<br />
T11 Normal Raid/PvP: x+19<br />
<br />
This means that if you have a heroic weapon from the previous tier, a normal weapon from pvp will be only +6 ilvl yet with horrible stats for pve (tons of stamina and resilience). Most likely such a weapon would be a sidegrade to what you currently have so no point in getting it. Now if you were very unlucky with weapon drops for an entire tier of content, or if you are only doing normal modes then yes you will probably profit from getting the weapon. But you will not feel compelled to do so</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I assume that English is a second language for you. I'm not saying that to be disrespectful, but please understand that I'm not having a hard time understanding your examples, I'm having a hard time understanding you.<br />
<br />
<br />
If those examples were hard to comprehend, ill try with something different. In Counter Strike the wining team gets more resources and thus gaining better weapons faster. At some point both teams will be with same resources but by that time the team that got the first win or the first few wins will end in first place for that round.<br />
<br />
The problem with PvP in WoW arenas has never been one of resource acquisition. If all gear were available to everyone who ground out enough points, then yes, the first team to grind out enough points would have an advantage for a time, but that advantage would go away the second another team got the same number of points, and there would be nothing that having the best gear could do to prevent that.<br />
<br />
By the end of the season, the most skilled team (modulo comps, latency, hardware, and other environmental issues) would be on top, and that would continue right down to the bottom with a few exceptions where teams formed too late to progress to their natural spot in the rankings.<br />
<br />
So the problem is not the items, but the fact that there is a feedback function. You get a certain rating (not points, but rating, mind you) and you now have access to better weapons. Now you have the &quot;high ground&quot; and can defend your position more effectively than those with a lower ranking can attack because they don't have the higher rating gear.<br />
<br />
If the other team is much better than you, they will win because the difference made by the gear isn't sufficient to allow you to win, but if they're just a bit better than you, then your gear can make up the difference and you appear to be better than them, even though you are not. In fact, it's likely true that if you measured all teams as a number (larger number = more skill) and laid them out in order or arena rating for last season, I'm willing to bet it would look a bit like this:<br />
<br />
1 2 4 3 5 6 8 7 9 13 14 15 10 11 12 16 17 18 19 20<br />
<br />
You see where there are numbers out of sequence? 1, 2, 19 and 20 are all where you expect them to be, but 13, 14, 15 come before 10, 11, 12. Why? Because between those two is one of the plateaus created by gear restrictions and the relatively small difference in skill between 10 and 15 can be overcome by the restrictions on 10, 11 and 12 getting the gear that 13, 14 and 15 happened to get first.<br />
<br />
One of the arguments against this is that 13, 14 and 15 will move up in rankings, allowing you to progress, but in reality they've found their spot, and they're not going to move up unless someone above them stops playing. Until that happens, you're stuck breathing their exhaust.<br />
<br />
Now, the new setup where only weapons of the max tier will be restricted might solve this because the advantage created by gear discrepancies might not be large enough to overcome semi-random factors like latency and just a bad day for one team or the other. It will entirely depend on the ilvls and itemization budgets of those levels.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deepone</div><div class="date">2010-04-29, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">some casual who isn't that good at pvp isn't going to change a thing from this just because he is in the same gear. He's gonna get railroaded regardless of this fact.<br />
<br />
<br />
But that's just the point. He won't. Unless this person is at the end of a 3000ms delay and has frequent seizures, he's going to fall in side the pack somewhere. There will be people he can legitimately beat and people that he can't. What changes if everyone has access to gear is that you don't have the case were he runs up against a team with a slightly higher rating (just over a plateau) whose gearing difference just manages to make up the difference between losing and, now, winning.<br />
<br />
Ratings restrictions never made the best players lose to the worst players. They did two things:<br />
<br />
1. Made average players lose to slightly worse average players<br />
<br />
2. Disenfranchised players who were nearing a reasonable rating for their team (or perhaps a few hundred less) and suddenly ran into people that they could not beat, not because of their skill, but because of their skill + gearing delta.</div></div><hr />

There are two very different issues, here.<br />
<br />
1. Being rewarded for your accomplishments (and not for failing)<br />
<br />
2. Being able to compete in arena<br />
<br />
There are dozens of ways to reward people for arena ratings. Just to name a few: titles, achievements, mounts, pets, gold, guild progression, listing on a public site, special tags on armory, discounts on account, unicorn meat fedexed to your house, etc.<br />
<br />
None of those involve creating system where the first players to achieve a rating can defend that rating by having better gear available to them from people who would otherwise be slightly higher than them in the ratings.</div></div><hr />

As an update to the original announcement, there will be two tiers of PvP weapons in Cataclysm. The lower tier weapons will correspond in quality to items found in the latest raid tier on normal difficulty and cost only Conquest Points. The higher tier weapons will correspond in quality to items found in the latest raid tier on Heroic difficulty and will have a minimum personal rating requirement in addition to costing Conquest Points. All of the highest-stat PvP armor, including shoulder and head pieces, will cost only Conquest Points and have no rating requirements. We have updated our original announcement text to reflect this clarification.<br />
<br />

This should have been the philosophy for T1 weapons for this entire expansion.<br />

A lot of players don't. Most twinks were created because people like being overpowered and crushing everyone under their foot. It's also why you see level 80 players flying into Honor Hold to kill fresh 60s. You can't please everyone. Evening the playing ground while giving top players reasons to continue their dominance is the reason Blizzard is doing this. While it will take longer for the less skilled players, they can work hard to make up the difference.<br />
<br />
The true reward for high end PvP is the titles. Finishing Gladiator or Relentless Gladiator is the highest award. It is proof that you are a great player. Other awards such as mounts, pets, and other vanity items are just bonuses. It's also pride. Being able to walk into a random battleground and show people how good you are is part of the fun. You can have your teammates' respect and see the fear in your enemies.<br />
<br />
Denying items is just more vanity. It's for players that want to stand near the bank and let people inspect the items they will probably never get. If people are willing to quit because someone is allowed to have the items they have, they will quit anyway. At some point, most gear become easier and easier to get and that extra special item will become more and more common. At least in the bank since gear decays by nature. Over time, we stop using that gear and move on.</div></div><hr />

For the most part, I agree with what you're saying. However, I think you under estimate how much people dislike waiting for their drop, or how much they dislike seeing their weapon drop and losing a roll for said item. People won't feel compelled to PvP for a weapon, but they'll do so because they have better odds. If PvE weapons dropped more often, then the situation wouldn't be an issue; but the situation becomes and issue because Blizzard chooses to make it one.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure this is how they were going to do it all along. Some people just like to assume things and make wild accusations based on extremely limited information. As a result, Blizz had to clarify.</div></div><hr />

lol do people really think they're sitting at 1500 rating and not progressing because they have s7 gear and top end players have s8?<br />

When this change goes live people will just resort to QQ'ing about comps/op classes when they still can't break 1500 in equal gear.</div></div><hr />

Horrible players aren't going to get all the top end gear if Blizzard is smart enough to price everything appropriately. The punishment for sucking is you get less gear and slowly. It's a bit petty to get pissed off because someone got a few excellent items. Personally, I think the biggest complaints would settle down if you required players to win 30% of their games minimum to get points, and maybe have more points for winning 60% of your games.</div></div><hr />

Because the gear isn't the point to a rated PvP ladder?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You know, every time Blizzard makes a change someone doesn't like, it's &quot;because of the QQ.&quot; It's never something that Blizzard decided based on what were likely hours of internal debate. No, it was the forum posts.<br />
<br />
Then, when they don't do something we want we get upset because they didn't listen to the players, who are, of course, the ones who know this game best.<br />

We're a fickle lot.</div></div><hr />

so basicly everyone that doesnt raid and only runs hc's and does some bgs <br />
gets a weapon correspond in quality to latest item lvl weapons in last raids on normal <br />

Well i bet the price will rise so lets say 2k honor/conquest points for weapong while you are getting 25 points every sday you need 80 days ( at least 20 mins in one BG average makes it 27+ hours) to get weapon.... well in my opinion its fair trade to spend that time.</div></div><hr />

Anyway good change, no more need to farm PVE to get a weapon for PVP. Fair enough.</div></div><hr />

Maybe to a certain extent, but don't forget: WoW was, is and always will be a pure PVE game. Don't expect them to focus less on the single most important part of the game which made the game as big as it is now: PVE.</div></div><hr />

There's no rating for current-puggable-farm-level-raid either. That's why so many teams wore PvE gear in arenas, because you could spend 3 hours a week raiding to get gear much better than the honour gear you'd have to spend 20+ hours farming. Your point?</div></div><hr />

How is this different from someone who joins a pug on his fresh 80 and joins a pug to the highest tier instance and gets a new weapon ?<br />
<br />
Because it's not.<br />
<br />
The way i see this this is a good change, as long as they can make sure that the second tier (heroic / T2) items are only obtainable to the better players.<br />
<br />
T1 PvE (normals) = Casuals / Pugs / etc<br />
T2 PvE (heroics) = raiders<br />
<br />
T1 PvP = Casuals / Step in gear for pvp<br />
T2 PvP = more serious pvpers<br />
<br />
What i see in this thread is seriously stupid comments of both sides who don't see the benefit of a two tiered system.<br />
<br />
The PvP'ers think its stupid that everyone can grab &quot;free pvp gear&quot; even though this currently is also possible in PvE with all these ICC pugs that go up to LK and all this highest level tier gear that's buyable from heroic runs.<br />
<br />
Hypocrit much ?<br />
<br />
The PvE'ers want that T2 doesn't require any pvp effort. Which I think is nonsense, This is still an RPG, that means that having better and different looking gear is part of the system where you are &quot;better&quot; than others.</div></div><hr />

It's to avert the case of early TBC were everyone did arena to get weapons. If weapons of an ilvl with heroic raid loot were available for no rating, many raiders would be forced to pvp for them (because, at least for melee dps, ilvl and thus weapon dps matters more than bad stat budgets). This way the really good ones are limited to pvpers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly this one. <br />
<br />
Blizz wants:<br />
<br />
1. Hardcore PvPers not have to raid hardmodes to get best weapons in game. Thats why Top End PVP get their T2 weapons corresponding to hardmodes.<br />
2. Hardcore PvErs should get they best weapons through PvE not PvP. Thats why there is Personal Rating on T2 weapons. To prevent farming them as in TBC.<br />
3. Everyone else can do some PvE and some PvP to get some gear. Casuals can get armor from PvE or PvP and T1 weapons from PvP or from normal raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What tanking stats on weapons you desire?<br />
Resilience? Resilience will be wasted in PvE since you will be already uncritable in defense stance.<br />
Stamina? Who said PvE weapons will not have as much stamina as PvP weapons?<br />
<br />
Best PvE tanking weapons will be from PvE hardmodes.</div></div><hr />

There actually were tiers in WotLK where pvp weapons where BiS tanking weapons for DK's :)<br />

Quite unsure with ICC, since my attention to DK tanking is quite low these days :)</div></div><hr />
