Movies and their release dates are often announced well in advance. Doesn't mean the date is always accurate though.</div></div><hr />

Why? Almost all big movies are announced like this. Look at the Avatar Sequels or Star Wars.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Heroes of the Storm is a game. It's registered as a video game. Plus, this is still 2 years away, and it's name is confirmed as being 'WARCRAFT'.<br />

A BIT EARLY YOU SAY!? :::takes a deep breath::: ...sorry about that. But like this movie has been rumored since like around the Lich King expansion came out I think, and that was 2008, I think is about time they went out there and said &quot;OK GUYS IS HAPPENING&quot; you know, maybe the movie won't come out for that date specifically but man, at least is an official confirmation of yeah we fo realz doin' et guise!! :D</div></div><hr />

Honestly - games made into movies and vice versa have never done well and that's putting it mildly. You can't cram a decade or more worth of lore and history into a two hour movie and expect it to do justice. I don't expect this to ever get out of development hell.</div></div><hr />

They've NEVER made a statement like that. Rumours, speculation? Sure. But they have not said a damn word about what the movie is about, through the doubtless countless iterations of writing it's gone through over the past 9 years and several directors and scripts.</div></div><hr />

Marvel does it. <br />
<br />
The Avengers: Age of Ultron is set to be released on May 1, 2015 and the fourth Amazing Spider-Man movie in May 4, 2018.<br />
<br />
Also the next Superman movie in July 17, 2015.<br />
<br />
Movies always do that. And they are always on schedule.</div></div><hr />

Where have you been lately? There are only limited release slots available and they all get booked as soon as possible these days. The pre release of Avengers 2 was just released and that has had it's slot booked for ages and there hasn't been a shot of that movie filmed yet. Hunger Games 3 has it's slot booked and the second one isn't out and so on. Two years for a release date is an absolute luxury these days for these movies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah the movies industry always do this. Sometimes tho the movie release date is either moved a bit earlier or later, the date they give to the public is an aprox date which gets stipulated in the contract etc etc.<br />
<br />
And is like someone else said above, they have to book the date and separate it. There can only be a certain amount of movies released each week.</div></div><hr />

Idk if the movie'll be a masterpiece, good or a piece of shit...The only thing I can say it's that is going to have a Hype-Halo around this event. I'm going to contribute wearing my Horde t-shirt on the release :D<br />

<br />
Yeah they did. I think it was in one of the Blizzcon DTV interviews. I believe the exact phrasing was it will be from the humans point of view. Which, if you've ever watched a single movie and read all the drama around its creation you'll know it means the Horde will be a &quot;sidekick&quot;. Do you honestly think a movie with half real actors and half CGI creatures on screen together all the time isn't going to look goofy?<br />
<br />
Undead, Tauren, Troll, Pandas, Orc, Spacegoats - just won't look right and believable as costumes and makeup. CGI has come a long way but many movies have bombed because they used too much. And to do it well it would be a HUGE budget. No studio will take that kind of heavy CGI gamble for a game that appeals to a small niche of the worlds population.</div></div><hr />

Last time i read info about it is that the script was made form the wow owners, the 2 guys, but they are not movie screenwriters right? Thats a big question mark there. unless they have <br />
hired awesome screenwriters to convert their script to viable movie.<br />
If we see on the trailers , medieval castles the movie will suck. If we see horde war machines and orgrimar , the movie will rock.</div></div><hr />

Hollywood video game movie adaptations always are, if this is a well made cartoon/CGI movie it could be pretty damn good. Especially if they hire good voice actors. The WoW universe doesn't work live action imo; unless someone like Peter Jackson or Guillermo Del Torro tackles the project I have little faith in the adaptation.</div></div><hr />

Think about it more people don't play WoW than do, more people who go to see the movie will have not played WoW or warcraft than have. This means most of the people going to see the movie no nothing of the lore. <br />

It's going to be a movie full of long explanations and no action, or its going to miss lore and focus on action / bodge around lore. <br />

I can't see the movie being a hit at the box office anyway. Sure i will see it and even if everyone who has ever played WoW or warcraft does that would be a disaster for them. They need to appeal to most people not just those who know warcraft.</div></div><hr />

Titan, which I rabbited on about on here for ages should have been Wow 2. And now with Titan shelved and the whole project changed, it will be Wow 2.

There is no way they would spend a large chunk of their fortune on a movie based on a game that is in the 2 million and less subs.<br />

I will remind you all of this post. I'm nice like that. :)<br />
<br />
You really think WoW will lose 5+ million subs in the next two years?<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
If they stopped releasing content and expansions, sure, but that isn't the case, it's updated just as much as it always has been, it's lower than it's peak, but everything peaks and you don't have to come crashing down from that peak.<br />
<br />
If something went badly wrong I could see 5 million total in 2015, but personally I see a steady 7-8 million in 2015, depending on what the next expansion is.<br />
<br />
I also don't think WoW 2 would ever work, just how radically different could they make WoW 2 to differ it from WoW without driving away the fans of what WoW actually is? It's an almost impossible task, revamping graphics etc would not bring back 12 million people, nor would completely different gameplay bring back said 12 million people and so on, this is why they are creating a new IP. Titan, or whatever the next mmo, will have to be a success for Blizzard to continue in the 2020's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
emo scenario : the hero of the movie is repeatedly ganked , ninjaed and scammed till he becomes a ganker ninja scammer so that leaves an opening for sequel<br />
<br />
lfr scenario : the hero of the movie is beating everything he encounters with closed eyes no matter how many comrades die in battle and eventually wins versus the archvillain who is hitting him with flowers.<br />
<br />
normal scenario (keep this for 2 years you will see) : an outcast of an honorable group of knights wanders around as mercenary for food/sleep/fuck etc till something legendary closes him by and makes him the hero he was meant to be and in the end he unites enemies and friends and wins versus the arch villain.<br />
<br />
our lore scenario : a human survivor of lordaeron disaster having lost family and friends becomes a ruthless protector of humans but in the end he realizes good and bad are on every camp blabla<br />
<br />
hilarious scenario : a poor undead wakes up in the grave only for a really evil necromancer to revive him as human lookalike. With his new body he wanders all around eating taurens elves dwarfs till he becomes too fat that even our moms look tiny in front of him. In the end he marries jaina proudmoore , eats her brains (i hate that bitch) and farts loudly on the screen<br />
<br />
our nerdy scenario : our hero is master of the blade shield dagger and fireball not to mention he can commune with demons that help him in battle, pets that fight for him and elementals that solo encounters for him. He makes a perilous journey where his dps and hps is tested and ofc in the end he takes the legendary offhand of Oscar just when world of logs crashes due to the infinite dps meters our hero reaches.<br />

I seriously doubt Blizzard as a company is funding this. Not when they can show their success with World of Warcraft to potential producers and just fill bags with the money being thrown at them. Even though people quit playing WoW, they are still somewhat likely to see the Warcraft film upon release. So it is fairly easy to work out a safe estimation of the minimum opening take. This movie most likely wasnt hard to fund at all and it definitely wasnt Blizzard funding.</div></div><hr />

What are you on about?<br />
<br />
Because it is a movie that has some link to the video game 'World of Warcraft,' doesn't mean only people who have played WoW will watch it, or understand it.<br />
Honestly, depending on what storyline they use (my vote, the Lichking storyline), it could be a really easy thing to pass onto people who enjoy movies and have not once played WoW.<br />
<br />
This movie has nothing to do with subs, or hardcore fans. It is down to how much money Blizzard use, how much quality they put into the movie. And finally down to which of the story lines gives the most heart warming results to having the best heroes and the worst bad guy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I just hope they put the effort into this movie, and make it a very long watch, and not over in 90 minutes.</div></div><hr />

Well, purely from a movie stand point they are great, but they took way to much &quot;creative license&quot; with the lore. The only way I can enjoy the movies is if I completely seperate them from the books.<br />

I believe the story is set around the time the horde first begins. follows an alliance hero who hates thrall. I believe thats all the intell that is out. that way it brings in people who never read, played, or know about warcraft; starting with lich king would just be a flop imo.</div></div><hr />

&quot;No footage of the teaser seems to be available online yet, but news sites described the trailer as a lone knight standing in an alien, desert world with a glowing green sky. After looting a discarded suit of armor, the knight is besieged by creatures coming over the hills. As an orc approaches, swinging his sword down, the trailer then cut to the logo. Although the trailer isn't currently available online, we may see it pop up at some point soon.&quot;<br />

It's no secret that they've totally missed WoW's peak, and subs in 2015 could very feasibly be less than half of the game's subscription peak. Would've been a nice thing to have out near near the end of Wrath, and it could've helped to stem the sub disaster that was Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
This is all assuming that it's even good. Franchises being big and popular has never stopped video game movies from being horrible. They can probably get away with a dumb plot, though. I doubt that the WoW audience is really going to care that much about a silly plot, given the game's own &quot;whatever's convenient for the content&quot; lore standards.</div></div><hr />

Hardly. It still has several million paying subscribers. With all the other free MMOs available, people wouldn't flock to WoW just because it became free anyway. It's much too old. Blizzard would have nothing to gain and lots to lose from going free-to-play.<br />
<br />
Also note that figures that are considered &quot;bad&quot; for WoW would be considered fantastic for most other games. WoW is not as big as it once was, but it's still a gigantic game with a crazy number of players.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otaka</div><div class="date">2013-10-02, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the story is set around the time the horde first begins. follows an alliance hero who hates thrall. I believe thats all the intell that is out. that way it brings in people who never read, played, or know about warcraft; starting with lich king would just be a flop imo.<br />
<br />
it should be about Khadgar. Medivhs apprentice, and medivh is the one who unleashed the orcs into Azeroth and Khadgar was his apprentice in the middle of that whole thing.<br />
<br />
Khadgar was like a regular mage apprentice from Dalaran who someone ended up to be Medivhs apprentice, and to be the only one who successfully survived it.<br />
<br />
He ended up being one of the main characters in the first and the second war, ending up in outland after that.<br />
<br />
So he is the only person who would make sense to be followed in a movie to make it understandable to people who have never played WoW. <br />
He starts as a nobody mage trainee in Dalaran and ends up to be the apprentice of the greatest evil in the history of World of Warcraft. (Medivh who is possessed by Sargeras the dark titan the leader of the burning legion, demon faction.... since his birth)<br />
<br />
The first movie could end at the point when medivh is killed and sargeras banished.<br />
<br />
They would however need to make an entire trilogy to cover the first war and the second war leading up to the enslavement of the orcs...khadgar could play mainrole thro the entire trilogy...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The descriptions about the trailer however, it doesnt make much sense to have a human in the outland if the movie is gonna be based around the first war? Im sure the trailer was either just a test and not a real glimpse about the story area. If it was then the movie will be based during burning crusade or before that at the point when the alliance army goes into the outland to destroy the portal and reclaim the relics claimed by guldan. (Before world of warcraft in timeline)<br />
<br />
Which wouldnt make sense to people who dont know this... would it just begin at a random orc with relics running to black temple with alliance army at their back? or will it start at the army invading outland without any real reason given and if there is a reason then it demands a prequel because first war and second war happened before this invasion...<br />
<br />
The orc invasion of azeroth should be a pivotal event in the movie.</div></div><hr />

They are hoping other rival studios will then stay clear of the date so there is less competition. This happens in movies all the time. It also gives the movie studio a due date to work towards instead of bumbling along and waste a bunch of money in doing so. Yes, movie dates can change depending on a million factors so don't hold your breath. <br />
<br />
For the date itself my guess they are hoping there will be synergy between WOW and the Hobbit movies since all three hobbit movies are currently being shown in the middle of December 2012-1014. Plus I wouldn't be totally surprised if we didn't see a teaser trailer in front of the last Hobbit movie and a full trailer in front of one of all the great movies coming out in 2015 like Avengers 2, Star Wars, etc.</div></div><hr />

the video they showed on Comic Con this year, they said it was a mood trailer.....so I don't think there is connection with the story, cuz start with Alliance in Outland is kinda after Second War......my opinion is that they just wanted to show its gonna be serious and prolly max violence that is still in PG-13 range.</div></div><hr />

I seriously doubt Blizzard as a company is funding this. Not when they can show their success with World of Warcraft to potential producers and just fill bags with the money being thrown at them. Even though people quit playing WoW, they are still somewhat likely to see the Warcraft film upon release. So it is fairly easy to work out a safe estimation of the minimum opening take. This movie most likely wasnt hard to fund at all and it definitely wasnt Blizzard funding.<br />
<br />
Correct. Universal and Legendary are putting up the cash. They just have the licensing rights to the Warcraft IP to do it. Blizzard won't get much out of the movie since they aren't spending much of anything.<br />

IMO, the time to do this has well long and passed. At the latest, this should have been released during WotLK. Now the fan base is declining and I highly doubt that I'll see it in theaters. <br />
<br />
Rental for me. Probably on some night I'm drunk and bored for something to watch.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure it is too late. The franchise is 20 years old next year. There are a lot of people in their 30s and 40s now that grew up with the franchise. So if the story line can relate to them, you'll see them show up for the movie. So IMO, they have to go back to classic Warcraft story lines and forget those in the WOW timeline. That'll allow more to relate to it...especially those with more $$$.</div></div><hr />

It's really amazing how many people can be so negative about something no one has but the slightest clue about. I'm in my 50s now, and I hated that behavior all my life. It's a trait of the elder people. When you are 70+ you can start to nag and argue about everything in bitterness. But not when you are younger. <br />
<br />
Had to say that....<br />
<br />
As for the movie: <br />
These bits were released last week in an article: Apparently Colin Farell was offered a leading role in the movie. Whether he plays in the movie seems to be a 50/50 situation at the moment. <br />
There's also nothing on the story revealed just yet. But it's rumored to have something to do with &quot;time travel and alien worlds&quot;.. <br />
Alien Worlds, we know are present in WOW.... Time travel exists as well... <br />
We also know that the movie does not play (that much was said at least) in our today's timeline in the game, but rather in the past. <br />
<br />
For myself, I am looking forward to the movie, and am curious what spin they put on it. Whether it's a good movie or not, I'll judge once it's made and released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
John Carter was a money pit because it's movie rights bounced around for a good 60 years past it's relevancy, then Disney thought it was important enough to warrant a 100th anniversary thing. People who were kids reading the comics from the 40s would have been 80+ years old when the big film came. After the 50s he was nothing more an a bit character that popped up from time to time.<br />

You can't try and pull off a successful movie based off a 100 year old idea that stopped being majorly relevant 80 years ago, unless it was culturally impacting and still remembered and cared for like King Kong.</div></div><hr />

I'm a little sceptical on the story. The way they've treated lore the past few years really grinds my gears. Makes me think it'll be as close to lore as just 'based on characters'. Use a character name and invent an entire new background and story to it, just to suit the biggest audience as possible.<br />

Based on your horrible negative attitude that I think should stay away from these comments, you think that a discussion is only talking down to a movie that nobody has any clue about. So, based on that assumption you made, I don't believe they would announce movies just so people can talk down too it. Please use common sense before commenting, thanks. :)</div></div><hr />

Yes, moves based on games/cartoons have been a disaster, especially lately (ugh DBE was just god awful).<br />
<br />
But seriously, we have Duncan Jones working on it now; sure he's made only 2 movies, but they were darn good movies as well.<br />
So we can have some good faith in him.<br />
<br />
+ We already know by now that the story will be focusing on the Last Guardian book, so the main character will be more or less Khadgar. And it's a good starting point if they try to make more movies of it assuming the 1st one is a big success. You can't just start storytelling Warcraft universe in the middle (what with people wanting the Arthas story being told).</div></div><hr />

I mean really, you'd have to be an idiot to try to do a huge hollywood movie without any actors. Sorry, you may want it to flop, but I doubt they want it to flop, since they've budgeted over 100 million dollars and basically pinned the whole legendary pictures reputation on this one movie. (They just signed a new deal with Universal). Look at the movies they've done in the last 2 years and tell me what flopped? This is the same studio that did the watchmen, 300, The dark knight movies, pacific rim, etc. We're going to see at least a decent wow movie.<br />

<br />
<br />
A view of a desolate, dry landscape full of rocky outcroppings that pans to a scruffy, armored human soldier drinking water from a leather skin. A cage with rocks in it is shown followed by a squeaking noise as a green tinged sky is shown with dark clouds and green lightning. The waterskin is tossed to the ground and the soldier draws his sword with a sound of metal ringing off metal. The human walks over to the skeleton a fallen soldier and picks up the soldier's shield. He smashes his sword on the shield, apparently testing it. Cut to the muscled green arm (likely of an orc) of a creature heading toward the soldier. They circle each other with flashes of green skin and some armor as they charge each other. An extreme closeup of the orc as it raises its hammer and brings it down as the human raises his shield. Cut to black. A Warcraft logo. And then the Blizzard Entertainment logo.<br />
<br />
To me this looks like a Burning Legion movie. Which seems awesome conisdering it won't get confused by the people that live under the rocks.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wafffles</div><div class="date">2013-10-02, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In some ways I'm as skeptical as you guys, but at the same time this is a movie studio, not Blizzard. There's different expectations, a different business model, different things are acceptable. Namely, they are far less likely to pull a Titan and pour millions of dollars into this movie, then decide in 2014 it's &quot;not working out&quot;. Nope. They might get to 2014, realize they're making a terrible stinker, and switch to a March release, but there's &lt;1% chance it gets flat out cancelled at this point. <br />
<br />
What I am surprised to see is the level of investment they're putting into this movie. I'll probably catch some flak for this, but I think the one thing that's drastically changed the circumstances of this film is the JJ Abrams Star Trek series. He proved that what was once a &quot;nerd&quot; niche with a loyal but relatively small fan base can, if done properly (in terms of reinventing the image), be turned into a major action franchise. I'd always expected a CGI movie, $75 million budget, unknown actors, Uwe Bowl or some such discount director. At this point (subject to change!) this looks like a far more significant project which, as others have said, may be poised to become a major event, a lynch pin for Legendary Pictures, and an actually decent movie! Now, there's way too many moving parts to get my hopes up, but a December release with a pretty good director and a larger than expected budget and some bigger name actors getting name dropped? Certainly not the lost cause it's seemed like for so, so long.</div></div><hr />

Well...Pixar can. The LotRo and Hobbit films are announced that far ahead. On the other hand, the WoW movie has been around for years and being always pushed back.<br />

Sigh... Every big movie maker does that. Also movies aren't like games. They don't get delays like that. And even if they do it's very rare. The Hobbit had already put all three release dates before the first movie even got out.</div></div><hr />

Because they actually confirmed it? Just because they mentioned that they wanted to make a Warcraft movie since 2006 doesn't mean it was in the works then. They have the crew now, it's ready to go. Simple as that. <br />

<br />
40M, is a pretty big investment for making a movie.. With the potential to make money, comes the investors.. The more potential you have to make a shit-load on opening week, the more money you get in the beginning to make said movie.. So let's hope investors take the game success as an indication to the movie (maybe) being a success.</div></div><hr />

What they showed on Comic Con was just a mood piece which they showed the people of Legendary and Blizzard to get the OK for the movie. In an interview after the teaser they said that the story will be different from what they showed in the teaser but they want to have the same feeling for the actual film like in the teaser.<br />
<br />
I don't think that we ever will see that teaser because people would think that it already shows things that will be in the movie. But this random announcement makes me wonder what they will actually announce on Blizzcon. We know about Hearthstone, Diablo 3, Starcraft 2 and the Warcraft movie. The next expansion must have something big if they are throwing so much information about other projects out in the internet.</div></div><hr />

I can see the director thinking it would be cool to have a warrior bladestorm, a hunter using stampede or a pally healing someone using the same animation as a human pally in-game looks. I see people saying we need to see a blacksmith or alchemist and it shows them conjuring potions like in-game. In order for this movie to do well they have to not use anything regarding in-game other then lore. Don't have a pally bubble, or a shaman cast a chain heal thinking it well sell tickets it won't..</div></div><hr />

No. You can't predict these things this far in advance. The post production alone leaves so much room for delays.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually they can, and do, every single day. The production of a movie has strict schedules laid out months in advance, before anyone even thinks about filming scene 1. Some go a day or two over here and there, some maybe even a week or two, but it's usually anticipated.<br />
<br />
These people do this every day, it's their job. It's just like when you're at work, if a customer asks how long before the fries are done, but you haven't started them yet. From your experience you know exactly how long the fries will take.<br />
<br />
Just because movies aren't announce normally that far in advance doesn't mean they don't know. They just know there is no point to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They honestly should do a completely new storyline that somewhat ties in with the franchise in certain places. That way players of the game will get to enjoy something new in terms of story and people who aren't already invested in the franchise will not be confused by constant references. <br />
The Lich King story line is too long to be crammed into a 2-3 hour film, imho, if you want to flesh it out properly.<br />
<br />
I can pretty much predict that this film is going to be centered around a human character, else the outsiders will have little relation or identification with the main character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing that I think will disappoint many around here...it is *not* &quot;World of Warcraft: The Movie&quot;. It is &quot;Warcraft&quot;. A lot of kids these days seem to forget the Warcraft universe is bigger than WOW. It has been around for 20 years. It is no more accurate call it a WOW movie than calling a WC3 movie. I would not be shocked if the story line covered in this has NOTHING to do with the story line actively played out in the MMO. <br />
<br />
The other thing to keep in mind...Blizzard and Metzen are only going to have so much say. Existing lore will be used as much as possible, but if it keeps from making the movie too attractive to the mainstream audience they will change it. <br />
<br />
It is a movie set in the Warcraft universe...which is quite vast. There are many rumors going around on what it could be. Some assume it'll take us back to the original Orcs &amp; Humans (Warcraft I) story line or time period. Others have suggested it will be around the time of Arthas. Some also suggest it will be surrounding Me'dan. The script isn't done yet from industry sources, but if filming starts in the Winter, it isn't far from being done. Will we get teasers at Blizzcon this year? Doubt it. It won't be until the cast gets filled out and the obvious leaks start happening.<br />
<br />
One last thing people need to keep in mind. This is not going to follow the normal SOP of a Blizzard project. Legendary is the boss here. Blizzard is a consultant. So don't expect things to go a certain way because Blizzard does them a certain way.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crakerjack</div><div class="date">2013-10-02, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If this is going to be live action, i'll never watch it... not even if someone gives me 100 dollars. Blizzard held off from doing this because everytime they'd meet with some director or producer... they could never get what they wanted. Blizzard didn't want to risk ruining their game with a movie... but now that the game is declining, a mediocre movie or even bad... won't really damage WoW. People need to realize, this is a warcraft movie, not World of Warcraft. Most of the lore will be from the comics and original warcraft series. I hope they do it in order and not just do their biggest story... if it's all about Arthas, then I won't expect a sequel... and even if they do create a sequel, it'll be a worse story since their biggest one is arthas.<br />
<br />
Here's my expectations... they film the movie w/ their animation shit... every cinematic that blizzard has put out, has looked phenomenal, there's absolutely no reason to try and go live action when you can make amazing animated cinematics. Secondly, it has to follow the warcraft lore/books in chronological order. If they just follow those 2 easy steps... i can only imagine that the movie will be amazing... assuming they hire the correct staff.</div></div><hr />

I hope they do it in order and not just do their biggest story... if it's all about Arthas, then I won't expect a sequel... and even if they do create a sequel, it'll be a worse story since their biggest one is arthas.<br />
<br />
Here's my expectations... they film the movie w/ their animation shit... every cinematic that blizzard has put out, has looked phenomenal, there's absolutely no reason to try and go live action when you can make amazing animated cinematics. Secondly, it has to follow the warcraft lore/books in chronological order. If they just follow those 2 easy steps... i can only imagine that the movie will be amazing... assuming they hire the correct staff.<br />
<br />
It was gong to be live action since day one with CGI...just like LoTR/Hobbit and every other fantasy film. Outside of that I agree with your points. The best option is to go back and start with the story line during the original Warcraft series. It is was the more money filled generation is familiar with. I would say you could also draw a very weak argument that WOW's decline started when Arthas was killed. Yes numbers were up in Cata but then the bottom fell out. There is a lot of good stories out there in the pre-WOW lore that Legendary can pull from to create a very good cinematic series. We'll see how this works out. The Warcraft IP is very rich. If it is done right Legendary can make a lot of money off of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
95% of the people that will go to see it don't/won't care about WOW.</div></div><hr />

So the story will be something that will be concluded over 3 movies. Also, I can imagine the people standing in line to go in on opening day, many dressed in WOW costumes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">finskee</div><div class="date">2013-10-03, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that I think will disappoint many around here...it is *not* &quot;World of Warcraft: The Movie&quot;. It is &quot;Warcraft&quot;. A lot of kids these days seem to forget the Warcraft universe is bigger than WOW. It has been around for 20 years. It is no more accurate call it a WOW movie than calling a WC3 movie. I would not be shocked if the story line covered in this has NOTHING to do with the story line actively played out in the MMO. <br />
<br />
The other thing to keep in mind...Blizzard and Metzen are only going to have so much say. Existing lore will be used as much as possible, but if it keeps from making the movie too attractive to the mainstream audience they will change it. <br />
<br />
It is a movie set in the Warcraft universe...which is quite vast. There are many rumors going around on what it could be. Some assume it'll take us back to the original Orcs &amp; Humans (Warcraft I) story line or time period. Others have suggested it will be around the time of Arthas. Some also suggest it will be surrounding Me'dan. The script isn't done yet from industry sources, but if filming starts in the Winter, it isn't far from being done. Will we get teasers at Blizzcon this year? Doubt it. It won't be until the cast gets filled out and the obvious leaks start happening.<br />
<br />
One last thing people need to keep in mind. This is not going to follow the normal SOP of a Blizzard project. Legendary is the boss here. Blizzard is a consultant. So don't expect things to go a certain way because Blizzard does them a certain way.It seems to me the script is done. There were reports dating back to july 1 that it wasn't finished yet, but now sources are saying a draft is finished. They're doing casting now, which you kind of need a script for. <br />
<br />
Here's an article from july 31, don't really know how reliable a source it is, but as wikipedia links to it so do I: http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/07/31/scoop-everything-we-know-about-duncan-jones-warcraft-film/<br />
<br />
It appears the script is based on the novel &quot;Warcraft: The Last Guardian.&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft:_The_Last_Guardian<br />
<br />
For everyone talking about how it should or shouldn't be about arthas, keep in mind, arthas didn't even show up until warcraft 3. I'm not saying they won't get to him eventually but there is alot more to the story of the Warcraft franchise than arthas.<br />
<br />
So yeah, the wowpedia page is a little bit behind. The wikipedia page has better info. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_%28film%29</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure the idea is there. Once they see how this goes they'll probably work on the next and hopefully plan to film them at the same time like LoTR and Avatar will do. Avatar is actually going to film 2, 3 and 4 at the same time I believe.<br />

Yeah the script is probably done, but it still is going to go through edits and minor rewrites...sorry I didn't clean my wording up there on that. I agree they definite have to have it done in order to do casting. :)<br />
<br />
I am good with The Last Guardian story line completely. Great time in Warcraft lore.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">finskee</div><div class="date">2013-10-03, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imagine scenes like the orcs spilling through the dark portal, and Gul'dan pulling back his hood to reveal that he is medivh, these will be epic scenes that define the warcraft universe for people who've never played the games at all.<br />
<br />
Also imagine Garona and Khadgar, working together, despite one being human and one being half-orc... battling medivh, controlled by sargeras, the destroyer of worlds. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zatetic</div><div class="date">2013-10-03, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">-they made a horrible mistake in the year. 5 years ago wow had a serious cultural impact and no doubt it would bring all kinds of player. Now wow is no longer what it used to be and in 2015 it will sure attract even less of a crowd. Not my problem, but the investors will sure &quot;lose&quot; some money.<br />
By what logic did you reach this conclusion?<br />
<br />
Firstly, the movie is not the game, the movie is most likely Warcraft 2. Secondly, Just because you quit playing a game doesnt mean you start hating that thing. If Warcraft was ever a big part of your life or an enjoyable hobby, I think it's safe to assume that regardless of how good or bad this film is, most people will still check it out. Thirdly, almost every movie loses money. So it being bad and it being financially unsuccessful are two different things that are not necessarily related. Lastly, Blizzard usually only attaches their name to quality things (with the exception of Megabloks, come on bliz its just shitty lego), and with a big name attached to it, it probably isnt going to be incredibly bad - even if the big name is a douche.</div></div><hr />

They obviously mean it's too late to save wow. Granted that is probably true. But this is a game franchise that is not going away. If Warcraft 4 or Wow 2 or Warcraft Whatevertheblank comes out these same people will probably be playing these games, no doubt at the same time talking trash in the forums about how horrible they are and how metzen should just give up and GC nerfed their favorite gocart.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I know that Warcraft isn't just WoW but I don't think that blizz will backtrack too much. The whole point of this film is to bring back old people and bring in a few more than that. This means that the veterans has to be able to relate to that(I'm talking about WoW here since wc1,2 and 3 are irrelevant today) and potential new players get interested in the current story of WoW.<br />
<br />
Doesn't seem unreasonable, does it? :P</div></div><hr />

Blizzard isn't going to talk Legendary and Universal to pony up millions and millions of dollars for a movie just to get people back into WOW. People really need to stop thinking of the Warcraft universe as just WOW.</div></div><hr />
