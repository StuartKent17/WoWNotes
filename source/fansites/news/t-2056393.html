Yeah I lost interest for this episode right there, tbh. All he made was an artifact skin, not the actual weapon we've seen for years. Maybe he could have used magnets for the holy symbol? Then again, how do they even work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
... That statement literally goes against how it actually is in-game. Weapons have grown to look LESS plastic and painted on over the years, not more... TBC being known as &quot;the disney era&quot; or &quot;clown era&quot; in terms of color schemes and hotch-potch sets for those not raiding/pvping and getting full sets.<br />

<br />

<br />
Well there were some pre-WOTLK weapons that looked incredible for their time and have aged very well, but yeah... pretty much that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SonicTMP</div><div class="date">2016-08-26, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is an embarasment. First off iconic is the original skin of Ashbringer. For a guy who makes weapons to be used in movies/tv shows/comericals it's a cermonial weapon. It's meant to look good. So no disc version is beyond stupid no matter what the reason.<br />
<br />
Second while the greatsword skin looks cool he sure mae it a little baby gnome size. That's pathetic. It's a GREATsword. You make a large 2h sword, yes it's going to be heavy. I'm ok with the blade being thinned but at least make it proper size and length. The warglaives were at least twice the size of this Ashbringer. <br />
<br />
Honestly I think a &quot;cheap plastic toy&quot; version would look better simply cause it be the original ashbringer, have the disc and be the correct size. Baffles me how blizzard could accept such a shitty dinky little dagger like that as the final product.</div></div><hr />

<br />
dont worry, even if they deny it, if they had put in a disc with say, a small metal rod holding it in place, they would have bitched the video out for going that way.<br />

People are too thick skulled to realize they are using the alternate skin variations of artifacts to promote the expansion anyway and they are limits when forging weapons in reality. UNLESS you make it a plastic toy with artificial work to make it look exact and fancy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well since its actually made out of different metals, you might want a reality check on your expectations. things look a certain way in reality. <br />
<br />
This one is literally forged metal, so your statements of &quot;it looks like plastic/toys&quot;, are issues that exist on your end and in your head. My point is that your expectations are deluded with fantasy when it comes to the reality of making such weapons and the metal working/forging process. You can't reconcile what this stuff looks like in real life vs what 3d graphics design in fantasy games.<br />
<br />
This is why these things are fantasy. It would HAVE to be a specially-made non-metal casted/plastic toy like cosplayers make for it to look like it does in the game but thats not what these videos aim for here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember someone in the thread about the warglaive forging video complained about the guy at the end not wielding them right, and stated (and I quote) &quot;they aint impractical the ppl just dont know how to use it in the right way&quot; and another guy said &quot;The problem with having only one of them, is that you have no balance because you are supposed to spin with them together to create a counterforce to the centrifugal force that would otherwise throw you off balance&quot; <br />
<br />
As if that would make the concept of a &quot;warglaive&quot; remotely feasible. <br />
<br />
<br />
People confuse things in WOW with reality and vice versa far too often.</div></div><hr />

As if that would make the concept of a &quot;warglaive&quot; remotely feasible. <br />

People confuse things in WOW with reality and vice versa far too often.<br />

But... but they're so cute and adorable when they believe those things to be true!</div></div><hr />

Ehhh.. it looks incredibly sloppy and that guy keeps cutting corners.. not sure why people keep going on about how amazing it is ;/<br />

Yeah, he only made the weapons for the Thor Movie, all pirates of the Caribbean, and like 100 other films. But yep, sloppy.</div></div><hr />

I don't mean that all weapons should be very simplistic but last few expansions most of weapons look like toys or like made of rock/wood rather than steel. I mean check out Duskbringer, Doombringer and many other often green weapons - they are bit too simple for epic weapon but they look more like weapons to me. I have way more tolerance to staves as they usually don't look sharp anyway. Same goes for armors in wow, almost all tier armors are so overdone, overcluttered. Ye, maybe its wow style but I liked it just tiny bit simplier, more realistic, less crude.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People should look up the &quot;Lucerne hammer&quot; - it's a real weapon, very simple... but it looks SO much more painful than any WoW weapon and really looks like it could kill someone with ease.<br />
<br />
As for armour in WoW, I tend to use the &quot;Overlord&quot; set on a lot of toons of mine - chainmail with plate bits here and there.</div></div><hr />

All of the super iconic ones at least. (Also not specifically artifact variants - warglaives of azzinoth are not artifacts).<br />

do tell what actual expertise and knowledge of weapon making, basic forging/metal work or even general prop making you base this on<br />
<br />
do people have any idea what goes into making real usable swords? If you're lost in fantasy, you lose a lot of the magic seeing them made. Which is idiotic because that shit is actually amazing.</div></div><hr />

It is outside the scope of this project, which is basically to make it cool and in game like for blizzcon, but I would like to see an actual re-imaging rather then a duplicating for weapons like this.<br />
<br />
Take the concept of Ashbringer or Gorehowl and use it as inspiration for a more realistic weapon that could actually be wielded and that doesn't look so 'cartoony'.</div></div><hr />

They aren't making the originals and considering the OG Ashbringer has a floating glowing disc this one is much more practical.<br />

Sharp as hell as well, you have to be so careful with it due to the lower blades that jut off from the base. Its a gorgeous sword, just so dangerous :D</div></div><hr />

I mean he could have attached it somehow w/ a clear bit of plastic or something, would have just broken when they hit things with it though. <br />

To be honest I don't know what you're talking about. It is based on the design he was given, and looks like the design he was given. What more would you expect from him? If you have any complaint it should be about what blizzard requested of him. <br />
<br />
Also we don't know what discussions he had with whoever was in charge of the commission, perhaped he explained different options along the way and they rejected them (such as the options for the disc), we don't know that. That doesn't make it sloppy and rushed, and honestly it looks pretty difficult to make, I love the handle the details like the font on the blade.</div></div><hr />

In all honesty I expect the same level of quality of the various other projects I've seen them tho, which are much higher than this one. I don't care about the disc really, I'm looking at the entire finished product and it just feels sloppy to me compared to some other things they've made. But most(not all) videos I've seen with Tony it's like this while the other team cares alot more about the details etc.<br />
<br />
Might just be me though and cus it's the internet I can just post it :P</div></div><hr />
