Update - Upcoming Paladin changes<br />
We know it's hard to evaluate the Retribution changes without understanding how the Seals now work. Here is how they work.<br />
<br />
Seal of Command<br />
OLD: Gives the Paladin a chance to deal additional Holy damage.<br />
<br />
NEW: All melee attacks deal additional Holy damage.<br />
<br />
Seal of Vengeance / Corruption<br />
OLD: Fills the Paladin with holy power, causing attacks to apply Holy Vengeance which deals additional holy damage over 15 seconds. Holy Vengeance can stack up to 5 times.<br />
<br />
NEW: Fills the Paladin with holy power, causing attacks to apply Holy Vengeance, which deals additional Holy damage over 15 sec. Holy Vengeance can stack up to 5 times. Once stacked to 5 times, each of the Paladin's attacks also deals 33% weapon damage as additional Holy damage. <br />
<br />
<br />
Upcoming Paladin changes<br />
We have several big changes coming up for the paladin class in patch 3.2. The paladin class Q&amp;A is still in progress, so rather than making you wait, we wanted to give you a preview of what we’re trying to do with all three paladin talent trees. We thought some of the patch notes might not make sense until you understand the design goals.<br />
<br />
Caveats: Some of these changes are still in progress and may ultimately end up in a different form or with different numbers. We definitely want to see these changes in action on the PTR and we will iterate on them accordingly based on player testing and feedback. None of this is set in stone. Furthermore, assume that talents, glyphs or set bonuses that affect any impacted abilities will also be changed accordingly. Finally, don’t expect that every class will see this many changes. We are making far fewer changes to class mechanics overall in 3.2, but paladins in particular have some issues we feel are in need of being addressed.<br />
<br />
Protection<br />
Currently, we think paladin tanks are almost there and that they just need slightly better cooldowns to handle some of the tougher boss fights. Rather than add a new ability that felt like a clone of another class’s ability, we decided to buff an existing talent that was no longer cutting it. Ardent Defender has two important changes. The first is that the damage can no longer “skip over” the 35% health level – it will always be reduced. Secondly, it has a new effect that if a blow would kill you, it instead sets you to 30% health. This portion of the ability cannot occur more than once every 2 minutes. Think of it as a Last Stand that you don’t have to push.<br />
<br />
A second change to Protection is we want to make sure Blessing of Sanctuary is always the tanking blessing of choice. A likely change here is to have it boost stamina as well.<br />
<br />
We also recognize that block does not provide the mitigation it once did. While we have long-term plans to change the way block works entirely, in the short term we are doubling the effect of bonus block value on items (so jewelry, but not shields).<br />
<br />
Holy<br />
We like that Holy paladins have a niche as single-target healers. The problem is we think this niche is a little too narrow at the moment. Furthermore, paladins don’t have a wide arsenal of healing spells so it’s important that all of them are being used.<br />
<br />
First, we are changing Flash of Light so that it places a heal-over-time effect on any target with Sacred Shield on them (the effect will be similar to Sheathe of Light). This should make Flash see a little more use.<br />
<br />
Second, and more importantly, we are changing the way Beacon of Light works. Currently, it does not count over-healing on the target. We are changing that. In other words, if you place Holy Light on a rogue who is already at full health, it will still have the full effect on a tank with Beacon of Light on them. This is a huge buff, particularly when you consider the Holy Light glyph which allows for a small amount of “splash” healing. This effect isn’t common when you use Holy Light on a tank because the tank is often standing alone. But if you heal the melee, you are likely to get a lot more total healing from this effect (while still healing the tank through Beacon of Light). We are also going to try to allow a target to have more than one beacon (i.e. from different paladins) on them.<br />
<br />
Many players may surmise that this change would make paladins far and away the best healers in the game. This is partially because paladin mana regeneration is so potent. That isn’t an issue when the paladin can generally only heal the tank. With the Beacon of Light change, the paladin can provide a lot more raid or party healing. To adjust for this, we are going to reduce the amount of mana returned by Illumination. If you use Holy Light too recklessly (such as on targets who don’t require that much healing) you do risk burning out of mana too quickly. Of course, they will still have Divine Plea and other mana regeneration mechanics.<br />
<br />
As a footnote, we are also likely to slightly adjust Replenishment and buff the amount of MP5 on gear.<br />
<br />
These changes should lead to healing as Holy being more dynamic – you are going to be targeting a lot more group members than just the tank, while still providing massive healing on the tank. However, you won’t be able to just constantly spam your biggest heals, at least not on the more challenging encounters. There is an opportunity here for skilled players to really do some outstanding healing as paladins, but it’s going to take a little more effort. This is something a lot of players have been asking for so we hope that it delivers without completely changing what some paladins enjoy about their healing style.<br />
<br />
Retribution<br />
Depending on who you ask, Retribution paladins are either perceived as being in need of improvements to make them stronger or are in need of changes to make them less powerful. We are really happy with the overall changes to the Seal and Judgement system from Lich King. However, Ret still has some problems. There aren’t enough buttons to push and they are all limited by cooldowns, allowing Ret paladins to have a lot of up-front burst without requiring a lot of skill or timing to actually hit those buttons (now after the opening moves of a fight, we think things get a lot more interesting because now the paladin’s defenses, healing and dispelling can come into play). We have other problems to fix as well. Exorcism currently can’t be used on players, which we think is a weak design. We have also become less enamored with the drawback to Seal of Blood / Seal of the Martyr causing damage to the paladin.<br />
<br />
Here are the design changes we hope will fix all of these problems:<br />
<br />
First, Exorcism has a cast time of 1.5 seconds but can be used on players again. This will let paladins use it in PvP, but not while moving towards a target.<br />
<br />
Second, we are changing The Art of War to make not only Flash of Light instant, but also Exorcism. Choose healing or damage. Paladins will have to watch for this proc and use Exorcism when it happens. The spell itself is still ranged, but the proc will only occur when the paladin is already in melee.<br />
<br />
Third, we are lowering the cooldown and damage of Crusader Strike to four seconds from six seconds. This accomplishes a few things. It lowers burst, it gives the paladins more buttons to push since they aren’t always waiting on cooldowns, it requires a little more skill since the player will have to choose between Crusader Strike and other attacks more often (such as the new Exorcism procs), and it gives Retribution a chance to get more damage out of their Seals (providing a sustained DPS boost for PvE).<br />
<br />
Fourth, we are removing Seal of Blood and Seal of the Martyr. The damage recoil increasingly felt like a liability in PvE, and wasn’t serving to offset the massive burst damage capable in PvP. We are buffing Seal of Vengeance / Corruption and redesigning Seal of Command with the expectation that these are now the seals of choice for PvP and PvE. Righteousness can remain a tanking seal.<br />
<br />
Finally, we are replacing the current effect of Vindication with an attack power debuff that works like Demoralizing Shout. In PvP, Ret paladins can still debuff melee targets, while in PvE they can provide another necessary debuff in the case that the tank is not a warrior or druid. In addition, the talent may be more attractive to Protection paladins.<br />
<br />
These changes do not close the door on adding additional attacks, PvP utility or even the oft-requested Crusader Strike debuff. If the changes outlined above finally accomplish the goal of balancing Retribution in PvE and PvP, then we can start exploring those other design issues.<br />
<br />
Again, these are our current plans and they may change based on testing and feedback. The changes to all three trees are things we are working on right now. Some of them might not work out quite the way we intended and will have to undergo iteration before finally showing up in 3.2. Even once the patch goes live, we are still likely to have to tweak numbers. This is simply a preview of what may yet come and we hope that it will be viewed as such.</div></div><hr />

Although other of those changes are quite... interesting. This will surely change around how paladins work. And probably delay patch nicely.</div></div><hr />

I actually love this idea. It reminds me of maelstrom weapon for Enhancement Shamans. A nice little choice to hurt or heal.</div></div><hr />

did i miss the part where he said cs will cause a debuff? all i saw was &quot;These changes do not close the door on adding additional attacks, PvP utility or even the oft-requested Crusader Strike debuff. &quot;<br />
<br />
also, they better not make swing timer reset when using instant exorcisms like using instant FoLs</div></div><hr />

CAT dps is great.<br />

But feral pvp is still too weak. We need a design change like the ones paladins are getting. Hope we get some good stuff, im gettin rather tired running resto druid in arenas. <br />

*pallies get to run holy and ret. But druids only compete as resto. <br />

<br />
<br />
Secondly, it has a new effect that if a blow would kill you, it instead sets you to 30% health. This portion of the ability cannot occur more than once every 2 minutes. Think of it as a Last Stand that you don’t have to push.<br />

not sure if i like that... the healers get to decide when we use it basically</div></div><hr />

I'll reserve final judgment for when we start seeing hard numbers, especially with the drastic changes to seals and Crusader Strike, but I'm looking forward to not constantly waiting on CDs because I just unloaded 20k worth of damage on a boss in 2-3 sec and now have to twiddle my thumbs a while before I can do anything else.<br />
<br />
I don't envy PvP rets with the loss of burst, but maybe you can catch that healer as he runs away with your new and improved Exorcism. Just make sure to pray for a AoW proc (I'm having SoC flashbacks...) or hold still first. :P<br />
<br />
And making SoComm, the seal that requires a talent point investment, worthwhile again? What a novel idea! Except, wait, does this force us to spend the point just to get to the same level we were at with SoM / SoB, seals we had for free? That sounds like another wait-and-see situation, but it's not like we didn't have spare points now, anyway, is it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ardent defender change makes the talent extraordinary, as in, guaranteed 10%-ish increase in your health by taking the talent.<br />

I'm personally incredibly happy with the holy changes.<br />

Really? cause last I checked hard modes drain all of our mana. You apparently haven't seen past the Spider wing in naxx cause yeah there almost every fight you end up 100% mana but not in Ulduar. So play a little more before you make comments like that buddy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
k.<br />
While I agree, there are a good portion of hard modes that drain most of our mana, the other changes compensate for that.<br />
Unless you'd like to keep mindlessly spamming HL for the rest of your healing career.<br />
<br />
Normal modes in ulduar still result in paladins with near full mana, however. &lt;3</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iselian</div><div class="date">2009-06-18, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ardent Defender has two important changes. The first is that the damage can no longer “skip over” the 35% health level – it will always be reduced. Secondly, it has a new effect that if a blow would kill you, it instead sets you to 30% health. This portion of the ability cannot occur more than once every 2 minutes. Think of it as a Last Stand that you don’t have to push.<br />
<br />
A second change to Protection is we want to make sure Blessing of Sanctuary is always the tanking blessing of choice. A likely change here is to have it boost stamina as well.<br />
<br />
We also recognize that block does not provide the mitigation it once did. While we have long-term plans to change the way block works entirely, in the short term we are doubling the effect of bonus block value on items (so jewelry, but not shields).<br />
<br />
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br />
<br />
First, we are changing Flash of Light so that it places a heal-over-time effect on any target with Sacred Shield on them (the effect will be similar to Sheathe of Light). This should make Flash see a little more use.<br />
<br />
Second, and more importantly, we are changing the way Beacon of Light works. Currently, it does not count over-healing on the target. We are changing that. In other words, if you place Holy Light on a rogue who is already at full health, it will still have the full effect on a tank with Beacon of Light on them.<br />
<br />
So.. much.. win....<br />
<br />
First, Exorcism has a cast time of 1.5 seconds but can be used on players again. This will let paladins use it in PvP, but not while moving towards a target.<br />
<br />
... Huh. Well that works!<br />
<br />
Second, we are changing The Art of War to make not only Flash of Light instant, but also Exorcism. Choose healing or damage. Paladins will have to watch for this proc and use Exorcism when it happens. The spell itself is still ranged, but the proc will only occur when the paladin is already in melee.<br />
<br />
Ah ha! More creative uses of talents!<br />
<br />
Third, we are lowering the cooldown and damage of Crusader Strike to four seconds from six seconds. This accomplishes a few things. It lowers burst, it gives the paladins more buttons to push since they aren’t always waiting on cooldowns, it requires a little more skill since the player will have to choose between Crusader Strike and other attacks more often (such as the new Exorcism procs), and it gives Retribution a chance to get more damage out of their Seals (providing a sustained DPS boost for PvE).<br />
<br />
Anyone else remember when the 2.0 talents were released, and people immediately cried foul to ret's new Crusader Strike? Went from 6 seconds to 10 seconds on the cooldown. And then back to six. And now to four. Iiiiiiinteresting.<br />
<br />
Fourth, we are removing Seal of Blood and Seal of the Martyr.<br />
<br />
Wait, what?<br />
<br />
The damage recoil increasingly felt like a liability in PvE, and wasn’t serving to offset the massive burst damage capable in PvP. We are buffing Seal of Vengeance / Corruption and redesigning Seal of Command with the expectation that these are now the seals of choice for PvP and PvE. Righteousness can remain a tanking seal.<br />
<br />
... Wait. What?<br />
<br />
Finally, we are replacing the current effect of Vindication with an attack power debuff that works like Demoralizing Shout. In PvP, Ret paladins can still debuff melee targets, while in PvE they can provide another necessary debuff in the case that the tank is not a warrior or druid. In addition, the talent may be more attractive to Protection paladins.<br />
<br />
Oh, well that's nice!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
... Wait, Seal of Righteousness is a tanking seal? Did I miss something?<br />
<br />
Other than that, ASDLKFM;SDF;G'ADFG;'AAIOJFJGGPOI and Blizzard crits my pants for over nine thousand. Really. Wow. And here I didn't think Paladins could get better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2009-06-18, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds strange. They are going to lower burst dmg, but don't give rets any interupt. How are they going to kill healers then? Not, that lowering burst dmg is bad. But this sounds kind of eh... &quot;blindfold&quot; (dunno if this is the right word since english isn't my mother tongue :s)<br />
<br />
<br />
Indeed... really weird... looks way more like a &quot;cute nerf&quot; than a rework/rebalance/&quot;skillnjection&quot; (not that there is no skill, you'll always see a &quot;just press everything all the time&quot; ret paladin asking why a lower geared ret is doing the same dps or even better than his). The Art of War change does bring just a little bit of &quot;extra&quot; for pvp, but would still be a &quot;no-brainer&quot; in pve most of the time (omg, do unecessary heal myself or do dmg on the mob?). It would bring a dps increase if the proc remains the same (taking into the acount today's CD on it and always instant cast). If they bring it in line to fury warrior's slam procs, it would be more like a dps nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
But the other changes... specialy the burst reduction without new tools... ret is all about burst or be killed, if you stream the bust to lower it (but at the end, making it the same final dmg) you will then need to give a way to him to keep itself alive long enough to reach that dmg. Ifnot, it's just a nerf to the basics of the class.</div></div><hr />

Your bad...exorcism doesnt fit into a pally tank rotation in anyway other then the pull. The only thing this hurts is picking up adds while aoe tanking as exorcism was like another taunt. If your tanking one mob though you shouldnt ever hit exorcism</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vengeance scales with attack power better than righteousness, and as prot you'll have a lot more AP than you will SP. <br />
<br />
Vengeance applies a DOT, so if you have to change your attention for a minute or if you get stunned or some such, your seal still keeps building threat, to hold against the DOTs from the DPSers. <br />
<br />
You can get expertise from gear, but any extra is always useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haven't tried tanking since BC, so I am not able to really comment a lot on it, although given that blocking is how we generate (or at least how we used to) threat, buffing it to absorb more would be nice. Paladin tanks are generally easier to heal unless they are against a spell caster boss.<br />
<br />
Ah the Holy tree nerfs... I can honestly say I am not surprised with the Illumination one. The rest of the people have to sit and drink forever after a boss fight because their mana is low and I can pop Divine Plea and presto full mana! This is probably because I heal with Flash of Light and not Holy Light (unless I am having to solo heal the OT in Patchwork). Beacon of Light buff is nothing short of amazing! I won't be wasting mana when I spot heal someone instead of the tank and another healer does the same; it will still heal the tank. More MP5 on gear is welcome, as I do occasionally find myself low on mana from the occasional need to spam HL, but this will make it so I never run out of mana when spamming FoL.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the Ret changes are needed. Being able to destroy someone in under 6 seconds because you happen to crit several times in a row is nothing short of retarded. I like the new Art of War change, as it provides options for the player instead of just do this and win constantly. Saw the Vindication nerf coming, since it lowered STA and INT, and those two affect HP and MP. New version won't be stacking with Demoralizing Roar/Shout, but that is a good thing if you fail to have a Druid or Warrior with you. Seal of Blood I personally thought was crap since they announced it, and I used it once, when I first got it at 65, and never again after that. Always preferred SoC since it did close to the same damage output and it didn't strain the healer(s).</div></div><hr />

Wow, have you even HEARD of a 96969 rotation? <br />

your two &quot;six&quot; abilities: Hammer of the Righteous, Shield of Righteousness<br />

Your three &quot;nine&quot; abilities: Consecration, Holy Shield, Judgement.<br />

Hit one from your &quot;nine&quot; list, hit one from your &quot;six&quot; list, and just keep alternating between the two; maximum threat generation and mitigation, and you NEVER have to wait for any ability to come off of cooldown.</div></div><hr />

I still think there should be a set of PVE talents and a set of PVP talents that are separate from each other. Anyway, my question is, with the change to exorcism, from a PVE standpoint, is it not a reduction in dps? Given the fact that it has a cast time and I would assume is interruptable it doesn't seem to be as useful in PVE due to damage taken and moving around. Definitely not useable on the Hodir fight except for when it procs to be an instant cast. Might be a dps reduction over all but then again the CS change could make up for that. Guess we will have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm... apparently you haven't looked into all aspects of the 96969 rotation.* Maybe you should do that before you act like other people don't know what they are talking about.* It's actually better threat to alternate between judging and exorcism.* This allows you to keep your judgement up on the boss at all times, assuming you have the hit, while increasing your actual threat output.<br />

Course, I don't know any prot pallies that are having real threat issues. The bigger concern for me is losing another tool to pick-up adds while already tanking something.</div></div><hr />

The Stamina from Blessing of Sanctuary will not stack with Kings. If you have Kings and Sanctuary on you, you won't get twice as much Stamina but you will get the damage reduction and mana from BoSanc.<br />
<br />
We realize Prot paladins sometimes use Exorcism to generate threat at range. While you can technically still do that, we understand that sometimes you might not be able to afford the cast time (say you are already in melee and adds join the battle).<br />
<br />
To address this, we are going to change Hand of Reckoning to cause a lot more Holy damage. However, it will not cause this damage if the target is already attacking you. This lets you use it at range on adds, but won't turn it into a rotational ability that you have to keep using while something is beating on you.<br />
<br />
The new Ardent Defender is just different from Last Stand. The former is arguably more powerful, but you don't have as much control over when it happens as Last Stand. On the other hand, you don't have those moments where you say after you're dead &quot;Man, guess I should have blown Last Stand there.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Well its not my main, i have 4 lvl 80´s and 2 around 70. Its by far the easiest to play.

GC gives us a nice change to Ardent defender, but he nerfed our threat with these changes. We might or might not cast exorcism, but there's a nerf to our Shield of Righteousness as well. (does 130% block value down to 100%)</div></div><hr />

So he want us to blow a taunt to keep threat? What happens if someone pulls off and we have it on cd? And change to BoSanc is a nerf in actuality. Sanc + Kings give us 10% stam, 3% reduction AND 10% to STR AGI.<br />
<br />
Edit: Whoops I had a second thought, the taunt change means we probably keep threat when we taunt a new add off somebody. But what's 500-700 dmg going to do? I've had a feral tank take aggro back just by his dots, which happened in Yogg-Saron p1, using the current taunt + Exorcism. Workaround is to swap sides.</div></div><hr />

They are increasing the block value we will have as well, have to assume this is to offset that change. Looks like they are also buffing threat for seal of corruption. Perhaps it will all even out in the end. We can hope anyway ;)</div></div><hr />

I don't get why do they have to do all these silly changes. I cope fine with the current set of skills. But doubling the BV would really help in mitigating the huge hits if I manage to shield block them.<br />
<br />
Oh I'm now also worried where will they double this BV value. On gear or the character? If it is on gear, it might be at most 100-150 BV increase, depending on what you're wearing.</div></div><hr />

Don't know how this would count as a nerf, they didn't remove anything from the blessing. This just made it a more useful choice for the times when you only have one paladin in a group and you can either take kings or sanc. Now if you need to take sanc for the mana regen you still get the stamina, very nice for tanking heroics.</div></div><hr />

Because it stacks with kings. With the changes we lose the Agi + Str 10% of kings but get 3% reduced dmg, because Sanct does not stack with Kings. So you have to choose one or the other. So I guess, Kings for the normal bosses (threat + avoid). Sanct for the hard modes (mitigation).</div></div><hr />

Oh, you are reading it like you can only have one blessing or the other active at a time. I don't believe this to be the case. The point is that bosanc + kings != 20% more stamina. If you have bosanc on and no kings you will get 10% stamina as well. If you have bosanc and kings both on it will be exactly how it is on live.<br />

This is going to come down to &quot;The Devil is in the details&quot;. We're all just going to have to wait and see what the actual details are and then see how many of the changes will stick.

I think the Prot change is a good thing...getting a Shield Wall like ability is a nice thing to have in rough times. Now i know the verdict from other tanks and/or PvP hardasses will be this is &quot;OP&quot; due to the lack of a button push to make this happen as some way of but you'll appreciate it when it saves your ass sometime.<br />
<br />
I dont have much of an opinion on the Holy changes as i dont play it but overall looks decent I guess.<br />
<br />
Deleting a seal to get rid of damage recoil does sound like a good idea all around and buffing SoComm and SoV to compensate for the deletion could be a step in the right direction depends on how the damage logs register. Being &quot;bursty&quot; will always be an issue in a game...complaining/whining/b*tching/moaning about it is Futile, now at this point some r-tard of a competing class is preparing that retort thats gonna give him some sense of pride and justice but let it be....we will overcome these changes and still throw out the DPS like a DAMN Holy Knight should...were paladins...thats what we do!</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure where the 48% came from. I checked MMO champion's database on spells and retrieved the following:<br />
<br />
&quot;All melee attacks deal [ 22% of mw ] to [ 22% of MW ] additional Holy damage, but the Paladin loses health equal to 10% of the total damage inflicted. Lasts 30 min. Unleashing this Seal's energy will judge an enemy, instantly causing [ 16% of AP + 25% of Spell Power + 36% of mw ] to [ 16% of AP + 25% of Spell Power + 36% of MW ] Holy damage at the cost of health equal to 33% of the damage caused. 14% of base mana, Instant cast&quot;<br />

Retribution changes, if they are not effective nerf by now will be that when it goes life. I really don't understand people who still hope to play decent retribution paladin - that will never happen. Changes so far looks more like nerf than like buff, but we will see...<br />
<br />
Speaking about holy paladins... That's 100% nerf and the person who designed it made his judgement about &quot;most skilled&quot; paladins from healing Naxx 10 at most by nuubs. <br />
First, good holy paladin, even in the mode when MT is BoLed and there's a chance to drop raid heal here and there, would never do it on the target which is above 50% of life - there are priests, druids and shamans to heal raid in non-critical situation. I will drop raid heal only if I am pretty sure it will be 100% eaten. So, the change in BoL isn't changing much for me. All my overheals, when they happened, are on the tank. <br />
On the other hand, Illumination is our single most effective way to restore mana - more than 40% is restored by it. Intellect is our most valuable stat. Now we need what? 20% mana restore decrease (I want to see how they are going to compensate it with freaking mp5) and about -60 intellect. For what? For an ability to BoL tank even when you select the wrong target for your raid-heal? Or for 6000 over 12 sec HoT from Flash on the target with sacred shield? Which is MT, anyway. 6000 over 12 sec is a huge buff on MT healing &lt;/end of sarcasm&gt;<br />
Second, good paladin healing actively, helping with raid healing and applaying all of his arsenal *is* going OOM on hard more even now. People, who are writing different kind of bullshit here about how happy they are they will not have 100% mana end of fight are either lazy ones in good guilds or haven't healed past Ulduar easy mode. <br />
<br />
All in all, Blizzard, please, please, spend your creativity on some other class? On rogues? Or, well, continue your exercises with retry paladins - nobody in healthy mind playing it amymore. But, please, DON'T &quot;IMPROVE&quot; HOLY!! You are not capable of. Your attempts to improve the class make it worse. Just let it be. Or all holy paladins around here will either reroll protection or go to play some other class, which you don't &quot;love&quot; that much.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't expect the old SoV glyph to stay the same. I think ret should get some sort of talented expertise talent like other plate wearing dps. 10 expertise is a ton for a strike based melee class. Good, but not much of a big deal for a magic based tank that only has two abilities effected by expertise.<br />

You also clearly didnt read the whole thing... just the first part and got mad cuz someone called your class easy.

The thing is, we haven't seen how this all works out yet, yes i agree the Illumination changes r very gay, and it will force Paladins to socket more Int so they can spam more, and the DI nerf from 15% to 10% counters the Int socketing as well... but cmon.. who w/ good gear and common seance cares? Me and my 45k Mana Raid buffed rly dont... i finish EVERY fight in game w/ constant HL spamming on 90% Mana Pool in the end... and by my calculations the Illumination nerf and DI nerf will fuck us over somewhat, but not enough for us 2 stop spamming. <br />
<br />
Now... the Ret &quot;Changes&quot; r indeed interesting, I know a lot of times when ppl cried nerf when the changes looked bad, but in fact haha Paladins got buffed, the removal of SoB doesent have to mean its a bad thing, from what i can see SoC will do the same thing more or less, just need to see what the exact difference is, and thats the main point, &quot;NEED TO SEE&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, from all the hate thats being posted about ret Pala in PvP from ppl that openly admit they dont pvp is just... wow, its just openly saying &quot;Hey guys! i dont understand this class, but hey! im gona diss it... since...yeah...&quot; <br />
<br />
The fact in pvp is that Rets dont have anything ex the burst, w/o it its very useless, we have no slow, no MS Effect, no OMG RESTO DROOD MASSIVE CC! No real way to get to our target ex walking (ex. Sprint, Charge, Death Grip, Blink, n so on) <br />
<br />
We r not like a DK or Warr or prob all other classes/specs in game, ex for the bubble what other hard defensive mechanisms do we have? None, once the bubble runs out, ur like a sitting duck, and all the good pvpers know it, push the Paladin 2 bubble, after that apply enough pressure and its a ez kill. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Prot changes r very good imo, god knows Prots do need it, but i know that PvP retards that play a Prot Healer will abuse this all so so hard, especially the AD Buff, how do u kill a Prot Healer in arenas now? <br />
<br />
<br />
All in all many many changes, i dont like to judge before i see how it all looks exactly, but all i see massive buffs, but Blizz clearly hasn't slacked on the nerfs!<br />
<br />
p.s. Hai Ino!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hedley</div><div class="date">2009-06-19, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking forward to the changes. The BoL change for holy could open up some new opportunities. Although the reduction of mana regen through crits will affect us, I'll only cry about it if it proves to be not worth the changes to BoL. The FoL HoT when DS is active is like getting the old crappy FoL glyph back, without the initial heal reduction and at no cost, so I'll take it.<br />
<br />
For Ret, it seems to me that Blizz is actively looking for ways to &quot;smooth&quot; damage from classes in PvP. If it serves the purpose of putting more sustained pressure on your opponent (and even ramping up damage over time), I'm happy to see the change. Being bursty is only good when you can kill someone in the burst cycle. With Arenas typically ending in a mana war, getting someone to 10% of their health repeatedly, but losing that mana war, isn't a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
As always, people will freak out. Changes on paper can be vastly different from the way those changes affect the game. It looks to me like Ret's might need to drastically change the way they play. I'll do my best to embrace whatever Blizz does. Once I'm confident I've learned how to play with the changes they've made, I can make a real judgment about their effectiveness. For now, we all know Ret is wonky so at least this *might* change things for us. :P</div></div><hr />

They are trying to buff Ret do you guys not read? Less cool downs more pew pew more buttons to press! Or does this scare you??? <br />
I seen some one saying about lower burst did you not see what was written less cool downs also exorcism also is back with that exorcism glyph equals more numbers, hoping they don’t remove the glyph that is! <br />
The CS debuff has been in question for a while and there has been a lot of QQ in the forums about it from healing classes (even melee classes “OMG my class will no longer be needed warrior re-rolls paladin) now that’s just silly do you see paladins with fear, slowing mechanisms, 1 talent that causes 7k dps in 6 seconds? No!<br />
What you have to remember paladin was only decent as holy in TBC and tanks were ok I guess, every other class can DPS even priests and shamans and now ret can do some numbers and everyone screams nerf… Get used to it go cry about a death knights 8k+ frost strike and scourge strike burst and stop picking on paladins.<br />
<br />
Last but not least lets see how these changes go before everyone starts thinking oh no it’s just a warrior with a bubble and no burst lol wait and see how these changes take effect! As blizzard do want to give us sustained DPS in PvE.<br />
Looking forward to the changes, keep up the good work guys.<br />
<br />
Now stop QQ and watch some arena videos of paladins to the person who said we can’t kill healers, it’s about timing and strategy not I want to kill you in 1 stun, go role a rogue if you want to nuke healers simple as that.<br />
<br />
Kkthxbye,<br />

Not meaning to contradict myself here but thinking about it 110% weapon damage on crusader strike down to 75% seems alot for removing only 2 seconds? not sure if this would calculate right maybe 85% would seem more reasonable? ah well cant wait to see the glorius changes. and hail to the gods its for the best :D:D:D:D</div></div><hr />

I can understand for PVE but last patch with the nerfing of judgments pretty much emilimnated all of a ret paladins Burst..<br />
<br />
My pally has around 4k AP unbuffed but still onlt get around 3-4k criticals on average with crusader in arena.<br />
Is a big blow when in PVP at the moment the majority of classes that are considered OP are classes that can root/pin Hold a target in place and deal massive Bursts of dmg, Like rogues dk's and mages dealing up to 8k criticals while pinning someone.<br />
<br />
In my opinion give crusader strike a slowing affect or give us another damaging slowing effect if your going to nerf all of our burst. A slow steam of small constant hits witout a slowing effect or stuns or mortal strike of some kind, really doesn't stack up to big Crits or burst to say.<br />
<br />
So whats that make ret in PVP now? It's a fail class all on it's own with little burst. No rooting effects, only a 6 second stun every 40 seconds if your speced into it, no mortal strike or interupts.. <br />

Yes there are fights that we have a lot of mana left, but for the hard fights we need that mana. It's one thing to nerf the bossfights so it is easier but plz do not nerf these spells to make it harder again, in that case just dont nerf de content so it stays balanced.<br />
<br />
All by all some interesting changes but DO NOT CHANGE ILLUMINATION AND DIVINE INTELLECT!<br />
<br />
If Blizz really wants us to be a more flexible healer and want to makes us heal the raid aside the tanks then dont nerf our mana and regen, cuz in that case we still have to choose, or heal the MT real hard or the raid and not both in most cases. Nerf Circle of healing instead..</div></div><hr />

In case of tanking Paladins have always seemed to take less damage over all, Warriors and Dks are the ones who have had lots of last resort buttons and Druids could take the massive hits. Paladins Tanks always suffered from lack of CDs to push. At most we had 3 + possable trinkets (Thats our shield wall, Lay on hands, and if you picked it up Glyph of Salvation). <br />
As far as the QQ about nerfing our threat... I have never had any problem keeping threat off anyone by a massive amount. Even in fights like Maly where the dps get a boost from the sparks I always kept 400k + threat on the boss with people pulling 5K+ damage.<br />
<br />
As far as Ret goes 8) I am personally going to enjoy the lose of Burst and more constant dps.</div></div><hr />

Just signed to comment this, as I have wanted to say that to others complaining about no interrupts:<br />

Ever tried stunning the healer --&gt; fire off abilities then when the healers tries to heal you would interrupt with repentance, and fire off another array of attacks?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Ever tried playing a ret and using your stun (if not resisted) and having the healer just immediately trinket out of it? ---&gt; not get much opportunity to fire off much of anything that gets through a good priests shield ---&gt; and when he tries to heal out of habiti because hes only at 70-80% you repentance him, only to have a mosquito break it, and miss another opprotunity to unload on him while he proceeds to fear you off into oblivion?<br />
<br />
You can do a ton of damage if you pop avenging wrath, but he will fear then and by the time you can click it off and turn around you cant catch him unless you use repentance. Dont forget hes not stunned, any damage pops him and he just runs away. Meanwhile you have no bubble since your flagged with wings and any other dps can go ahead and rape you.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Voltulio</div><div class="date">2009-06-19, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very interesting. Not sure i like it, but we'll see. For my Prot spec - I dont think we need the help, but I'll take it. <br />
<br />
For my Ret spec...well...I have been ret since the beginning - the allure of a vengeful paladin is a class I MUST play. I suffered through the lolret days of old...and the glorious days of omgret with the preposterous buff at lvl 70 (went from 10th dps to 1st in my raids). And finally to the more balanced Ret of today.<br />
<br />
Ret PVE: I am not displeased with the changed for pve, though the 1.5 sec cast and watching for the instant Exorcism buff is annoying. Its ok not to be top of the meters considering everything else a ret pally brings to a raid. We still do damn good. Also, every good ret pally has finished off a tough boss by throwing out decisive heals on the tank if the healer goes down - utility is something we excel at, but has been lost somewhat because of the allure of massive burst dps.<br />
<br />
Ret PvP: Gonna be interesting...melee dps classes have ruled pvp in BGs and arena for the most part. I think their utility for 2v2 arena will be lacking, but should work out quite nicely with 3v3 or 5v5 teams where strategy is more important versus than trying to burst a healer down alone in 2v2. I think Blizz wants to focus more on the 3v3 and 5v5 since they know that 2v2 is a game of rock/paper/scissors and cant change it easily.<br />
<br />
Not sure why so much attention is being given to Ret though...i didnt see all that much to fix honestly.<br />
<br />

The change from burst to more constant dmg for CS will make ret pally a little more dynamic. <br />
Having to wait for any of the cooldowns on your offensive abilites to finish was pretty lame.<br />
<br />
Also, the new HoT on sacred shield buffed players will reinforce ret's self-heal a bit more (you have to admit, the heals ret pally gets from the instant FoL was pretty futile.)<br />
Having to make the choice between instant Exorcism or instant heal makes it much more versatile to play ret in PvP.</div></div><hr />

You should really read the patch before you QQ nerf...First off they are nerfing crusader strike not bad and they made it so you have to think now before clicking on exo but who cares it will just weed out people who do not know how to play the class proper. As for pvp we still have the same dps i think because with the loss of some dps from crusader strike we get to hit it more and if every thing is timed and done proper your burst is till up there.....Stun then judge (seal of command is 100% crit) which means u can exor instant. then u still have CS,DS (with white damage and command proc) and hand of reconing that does 50% of ur AP as damage... still all done in 4-5 GCD So all in all its the same ammount of burst i think just with more buttons to push. can still easly burst something down while the healer is cc chained</div></div><hr />

I can see Holys carrying 2 sets of gear (like every other healer) now. One for Max HPS for a sub 5 minute fight, and then one MP5 set for the few marathons in the game.<br />
<br />
Personally not being one of the afore mentioned BiS types, I like the changes. I already have a decent amount of gear with MP5 on it because I hadn't farmed out all the crit/haste stuff yet. It also makes the T8 stuff much more attractive. Chest, Hands, and Legs all have MP5 and that 4 piece bonus is looking even better now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exorcism change is STUPID, coming from a prot pally point of view. 1.5 sec cast, while boss is hitting on you could sometimes result in tank death. Ever since Exorcism was changed in 3.1, I was happily using it as a threat spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
this is actually good imo, there was already enough threat spells as prot. adding exo just made tanking boring (and yes i do tank 25man Ulduar)</div></div><hr />

Naw. Now we have those amazing 5-6k crits with exorcism instantly hitting you, and if people are correct, might be every 5 seconds, with a 4 second cd hit with CS (which is almost as strong as before they buffed it last patch to 137% damage with talents and such) + the wicked seal of vengeance effect, which 33% of weapon damage as holy is being non-mitigated by armor, and crits are 66% (double damage) as holy, so if you had 2k weapon damage (as example) that's an additional 1345 damage or whatever 66% is, way better than Seal of Blood ever did, PLUS atm the dot ticks for 1500 per 3 seconds in raid for me, and they are buffing it? Wow, this will be amazing constant damage, and it will be reapplied constantly with CS having 4 second cd. No one is going to sit there and spam cleanse to take 1 dot stack away at a time, so funny....and if you stack it on everyone with divine storm, hahaha....thanks for cool stuff Blizz, I might actually reactivate my WOW account before 3.2 comes out!</div></div><hr />
