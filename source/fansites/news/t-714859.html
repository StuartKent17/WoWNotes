Connect with Your Friends Using Real ID<br />
We’ve just released a new preview of our upcoming Real ID feature, ( http://www.battle.net/realid/ ) a new, optional way to connect with your friends on the revamped Battle.net. When you and a friend agree to become Real ID friends, you’ll have access to a number of options designed to enrich your social gaming experience, including cross-game chat, broadcast messages, the ability to keep in contact with your friends without having to keep track of their different characters across realms or across games, and much more. Check out our new Real ID page here. http://www.battle.net/realid/<br />
<br />
Battle.net Real ID<br />
<br />
<br />
One of our goals for the new Battle.net is to create the framework for an online gaming experience that is even more accessible, more engaging, and more entertaining than the previous Battle.net. Our new Real ID feature is an integral part of this effort, providing you with advanced ways for forming and maintaining meaningful relationships with your friends on the service.<br />
<br />
Real ID is a completely voluntary and optional level of identity that keeps players connected across all of Battle.net. When you and a friend mutually agree to become Real ID friends, you'll have access to a number of additional features that will enrich your social gaming experience in new and exciting ways.<br />
<br />
Read the Real ID FAQ (http://us.battle.net/realid/faq.html)for additional details.<br />
<br />
Real Names for Friends<br />
Your Real ID friends will appear under their real-life names on your friends list, alongside whatever characters they're playing. Gone are the days of having to remember which of your friends is which. You'll also see your friends' real names when chatting, communicating in-game, or viewing their character's profile.<br />
<br />
Cross-Game Chat<br />
With Real ID, friends can now chat cross-game, cross-realm, and cross-faction across all supported Blizzard games. In World of Warcraft and need more players for your Icecrown Citadel raid? You check your Real ID friends list to see if anyone's available, and sure enough, a couple of guildmates are playing a 2v2 ranked match in StarCraft II. Real ID makes it easy to ask them to come along.<br />
<br />
Rich Presence<br />
See additional information on your friends list about what your Real ID friends are up to. Find out what your friends are doing and which games and modes they're playing in real time. Invite that buddy just sitting around in Dalaran to play some StarCraft II with you without fear of interrupting a raid or a heated Wintergrasp match.<br />
<br />
Broadcasts<br />
Broadcast a short status message for all of your Real ID friends to see, whether you want to issue a call-to-arms or let your friends know about an important change of plans. You can also read your friends' broadcast messages on the &quot;Recent Broadcasts&quot; feed on the Battle.net welcome page -- kind of a &quot;corkboard&quot; to leave messages to your friends when offline or busy.<br />
<br />
Friend Once, See All Characters<br />
When you agree to become Real ID friends with another player, both of you will automatically see all the other's characters on your friends list. You'll even see any characters your friend creates in future Blizzard games, carrying your social network forward and helping you stay connected with the people you enjoy playing with most.</div></div><hr />

A guild leader may encourage its members to add him/her as a friend, and by doing so be able to audit your activities. Don't feel like raiding, but want to do BGs on a different character instead? Too bad, your guild leader will know where you are, what you are doing and penalize you for missing raid for a non RL reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why would you join a raiding guild if you didn't want to raid?<br />

Seriously though, RealID looks awesome and I've been looking forward to this for too long. Hurry it up!</div></div><hr />

Not wanting to raid for a day, doesn't mean you don't want to raid, ever. If I had a hard day at work or some sleepless nights, I will decline a raid and play an easy alt. I'm sure I'm no unique snowflake, so more people do that.<br />

<br />
No, you need your friend's email address in order to add them as a &quot;RealID&quot; friend.<br />
<br />
Personally, I can think of about one person on earth that I'll add as a RealID friend. This whole fake friendster approach to Bnet is mostly useless crap. The worst part of it is that they've removed the stuff that actually was already proven to work, like dedicated chat channels. If you have a clain in SC2 and all 30 of you want congregate in a single channel... well, too bad. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure why Blizzard is so proud of Bnet 2.0. If anything they ought to be embarassed at how underwhelming it is, and how it is (at best) two steps forward and one step back. They've more or less ignored every bit of feedback they ever got from their RTS community in order to chase the social networking fad. Hey, if they want to make facebook/friendster too, then whatever, that's fine, but ultimately if I want facebook I'll get on facebook.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raiding Guild: Come join our ranks as we progress through [insert current content]! RealID required to join.<br />
<br />
Part of what I like about alts is not having to tell anyone who they are. If I don't feel like raiding that night but still wanna play WoW, I can hop on an alt. I foresee RealID being required by a lot of raiding guilds. I don't think is something Blizzard intends and I'm sure they've considered it, but it won't stop people from abusing it, regardless.</div></div><hr />

Where I'm from, people say &quot;To each his own&quot; or &quot;To each their own&quot; which is at least as correct, grammatically, as &quot;each to their own.&quot; <br />

If you said &quot;each to their own&quot; people might know what you meant, but they'd probably assume you were dyslexic or perhaps mildly retarded for using a common idiom incorrectly.

Both versions are correct. In fact, &quot;to each their own&quot; gets more hits on google if you want an idea of general use. I find it strange to correct the &quot;grammar&quot; of an idiom at all, actually...<br />
<br />
As for RealID, I think it will add a lot of depth to Blizzard's games by sort of pooling each gaming community into one. I'm sure several of my friends will take up SC2 when it comes out and I'm surely going to play Diablo 3, but we'll all still likely be playing through Cataclysm together. It really is a perfect time to implement it.</div></div><hr />

Why people are making that out to be a bigger deal than it is is beyo--- oh no wait. It's the internet. The sky is constantly falling here.<br />
<br />
I see the good that RealID brings to the table. I also took the time to think about how it can, and in some cases will, be abused. Like the example I provided earlier: Raiding guilds will require your RealID as either part of your application or in order to join the guild at all. Will all of them do that? Certainly not. Will there be guilds out there that will try to justify themselves requiring it? It would be foolish to think otherwise.</div></div><hr />

A guild leader may encourage its members to add him/her as a friend, and by doing so be able to audit your activities. Don't feel like raiding, but want to do BGs on a different character instead? Too bad, your guild leader will know where you are, what you are doing and penalize you for missing raid for a non RL reason.<br />

<br />
About the whole Battle.net changes. Its simple.<br />
<br />
If you are worried about , friends of your friends, that you do not know, seeing your real name etc.. then just dont do the &quot;RealID&quot; thing, if your worried about your privacy afterall this is totally optional<br />
<br />
Simply stay as a World of Warcraft/SC friend, yeah sure, you miss out on some nice new shiny features, but tbh, if your privacy matters, and your that worried about it, then this is the way to go.<br />
<br />
Your friends will still know your characters name, and you can still have that quiet time ..to level alts etc.<br />
<br />
So just Chiiiiiiiil.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looking at your list of characters in your sig, I'm guessing that at least a couple of them are raiding toons. Now lets pose a hypothetical situation (I could care less if they would really do what I'm about to say or not, hence why it's hypothetical).<br />
<br />
After RID is implemented your guild leader makes the announcement that you are required to provide your RID information in order to remain in the guild. Ultimately, it's &quot;optional&quot; from a game perspective. But now your GL has made it a requirement to be a part of the guild. Do you stay with the guild and give up any &quot;privacy&quot; that your alts may provide or do you /gquit and look for a new guild?<br />
<br />
Some guilds will attempt to make it a requirement. The simple answer is, of course, don't join those guilds. But what if that guild is yours and it's one of the most progressed on the server? How much will you sacrifice just to see content? Are you willing to give up your privacy for it? Afterall, RID is &quot;optional&quot; right?</div></div><hr />

Actually I didn't miss the point. My main point is the fact that there has been no indication that there is an Alpha forums. Even if there was, the point of them having the images in there is to have placeholders for when the final images show up. Almost every single new class combination has a placeholder image in place.

Your name is already out there and most people wanting to do harm with your info will not wait until a convenient feature comes out that hands it out to them.<br />
<br />
This systems requires your permission for people to see your name and it doesn't show more than that according to the post, mainly so people can associate one name with one person and not from toon to toon or game to game.<br />
<br />
We live in a world where online communication is as standard as face to face. This isn't going to make you more or less safe, but it makes communication easier. Why hide behind the, false, idea of assumed security. My information is already out there and I try to protect it but I know that things like names get passed around too easy and there's little I can do to stop it, so i might as well get some benefit that makes staying in touch easier.<br />
<br />
As for those who feel this could be abused by guilds, don't join them if they require it, most of those guilds will find themselves either empty or full of people with that hardcore mentality. When I ran a guild, I didn't need to see people online to figure out what was going because I bothered to get to know my people back then.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to be bothered even by friends, well tell them. If they don't understand, remove them, put up a DnD flag, or just never sign people on to the real ID with you, don't come bashing something you didn't want to use. If you don't use it, the game will still be the same for you, other people using it won't kill your game, stop with the useless paranoia.</div></div><hr />

I'll use the lvl 80 folder to show that these are placeholder images and not the default folder that normally houses the lvl 1 images. Also I'm reitterating how I came up with these numbers. Also due to the fact that we now know the basic look of the wargen and goblin I'll not link them. That and they all use the EXACT SAME image.<br />

1 - Female<br />

<br />
Most privacy issues are already there, they will just be more apparent by using a newer system. Besides getting to see your real name, people aren't getting a whole lot of new information. If someone already knew your real name, they gain nothing but an easier way to keep in touch.<br />
<br />
Most of the issues I've seen here are simple paranoia and have little to do with the actual changes coming up, but it is understandable and I used to feel the same way every time I did something new online, but its never really been an issue as long as you play it safe and smart as you actually USE the newer technology.</div></div><hr />

When you agree to become Real ID friends with another player, both of you will automatically see all the other's characters on your friends list. You'll even see any characters your friend creates in future Blizzard games, carrying your social network forward and helping you stay connected with the people you enjoy playing with most.<br />
<br />
I wonder if I'm the only one seeing this being abused by &quot;raiding&quot; guilds.<br />
<br />
Raiding Guild: Come join our ranks as we progress through [insert current content]! RealID required to join.<br />
<br />
Part of what I like about alts is not having to tell anyone who they are. If I don't feel like raiding that night but still wanna play WoW, I can hop on an alt. I foresee RealID being required by a lot of raiding guilds. I don't think is something Blizzard intends and I'm sure they've considered it, but it won't stop people from abusing it, regardless.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're the kind of person who wants to take a night off but can't let the other 24 guildies know then give up your slot. You're the kind of person guilds would love to not have in raids, so gogo RealID.<br />
<br />
But of course any guild requiring this is pretty lame and I know I wouldn't require it, being the GM of my guild. It's the same as Steam. Add your friends, chat them and stalk them!!!! Cross-realm chat sounds awesome though since Everquest has had this since 1999.</div></div><hr />

It should be pointed out that there are two different types of friends: Friends as WoW has them now where you do it on a per character basis and a Real ID friend. <br />
General Friends work as they currently do now, say you meet someone you like in a pug that you would like to play with again in future. However Real ID Friends involve entering the other persons battle.net account name then having that person accept your invitation, someone can't just add you without your knowledge, its a mutual exchange. You wouldn't really do it unless its someone that you know well.</div></div><hr />

A guild leader may encourage its members to add him/her as a friend, and by doing so be able to audit your activities. Don't feel like raiding, but want to do BGs on a different character instead? Too bad, your guild leader will know where you are, what you are doing and penalize you for missing raid for a non RL reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
Um... and rightfully so? Seriously, if you blow off a raid to run battlegrounds on another character and lie about it, you fail at raiding. Our raid has an acronym for the proper response to this behavior: AWNIHA.<br />
<br />
&quot;And We Never Invited Him Again/Her Again.&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alfadorfox</div><div class="date">2010-05-06, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That RealID thing is a piece of crap. WoW is a video game, you're not supposed to make friends with others, you're supposed to just play the damn game with other people. It's bad enough they're adding that Facebook crap.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then why have a friends list at all? Because some people want to maintain contact with people they've enjoyed playing with.<br />
<br />
So why go RealID if you only want to be in contact with certain characters? Because, oh, I don't know, you might have ACTUAL REAL LIFE FRIENDS who you want to keep in contact with regardless of character. Though of course I can see why someone might not understand this if they don't have any real friends. That'd be totally understandable. I'm not angry. Really.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bones09</div><div class="date">2010-05-06, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm amused at how many people don't want to reveal their real names to people they play with and trust online, yet many of us will hand out even more personal information to websites for forums or online purchases without much thought. Your name is already out there and most people wanting to do harm with your info will not wait until a convenient feature comes out that hands it out to them.<br />
<br />
This systems requires your permission for people to see your name and it doesn't show more than that according to the post, mainly so people can associate one name with one person and not from toon to toon or game to game.<br />
<br />
We live in a world where online communication is as standard as face to face. This isn't going to make you more or less safe, but it makes communication easier. Why hide behind the, false, idea of assumed security. My information is already out there and I try to protect it but I know that things like names get passed around too easy and there's little I can do to stop it, so i might as well get some benefit that makes staying in touch easier.<br />
<br />
As for those who feel this could be abused by guilds, don't join them if they require it, most of those guilds will find themselves either empty or full of people with that hardcore mentality. When I ran a guild, I didn't need to see people online to figure out what was going because I bothered to get to know my people back then.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to be bothered even by friends, well tell them. If they don't understand, remove them, put up a DnD flag, or just never sign people on to the real ID with you, don't come bashing something you didn't want to use. If you don't use it, the game will still be the same for you, other people using it won't kill your game, stop with the useless paranoia.<br />
<br />
You're right - much of what security we think we have online is assumed. But you know what? If I meet some guy online and hang out with him and play in the same guild, then one day he gets pissed at me because I rolled need on some item he really wanted I don't have to worry about any repercussions outside of the game because he doesn't know the first thing about me. I've made some very good friends in WoW and online and the most they know about me is my first name and maybe what state I live in. Throw real ID into the mix. Now someone you upset could be off throwing around your real name talking about how you're a liar, a cheat, and just generally mean. It might not seem like much, but employers are already searching Facebook to see what information they can find about a person before hiring them. If they found comments from someone about how you're a liar and a cheat, wouldn't that have as much effect as what some FB info is already having on some job seekers?<br />
<br />
Even if you don't upset them, what if they're laughing about what a &quot;jerk&quot; you are because you repeatedly ganked some low level gnome who couldn't fight back? Could an employer view that as an indication of a lack of empathy?<br />
<br />
Here's the thing you have to keep in mind about the information age. Your information is out there. It will get out there. The less of it you provide, the better. But even with what you do provide, you have to take care to avoid having people aggregate that information into a more clear picture of who you are because I guarantee you that information will contain mistakes and flat out false information sooner or later. I also guarantee you that, sooner or later, someone will make a decision that can and probably will affect your life based off of that aggregate information.<br />
<br />
Hopefully by the time this launches the Real ID will have certain features that can be disabled. So you can show an account name (like Steam), be &quot;invisible&quot; while online, or choose to hide certain games or characters from the system. After it launches... well, it'll be too late.<br />
<br />
What's so awesome about all these great new social network ideas that link your name to so much different stuff is that it's so new that no one truly understands what's being done with all of the information being aggregated by these ideas and all new generations are being raised with the expectation that this is the norm. So even once people start to grasp the nature of what's going on, it'll be too late because no one will remember the days when they actually had privacy.</div></div><hr />

You kidding? Sex sells, it's a basic principle of advertising. Everybody who buys World of Warcraft just to jerk off to a sexy worgen rear (or elf rear, or human rear--tastes vary, after all) is putting money in the bank for Blizzard. They don't care what you do in the privacy of your own basement, just so long as you don't talk about it in in-game public channels where kids could hear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I see your point, but many real life people we know could easily cause many of the same issues, my point is this idea that people seem to think that people they meet online are less human in a sense than those they meet face to face, the problems this program &quot;might&quot; cause can already be issues by people we see everyday.<br />
<br />
Most of this stuff is optional, like the Real ID and FB connection, they stated it was only possible, not mandatory.<br />
<br />
As for employers, smart ones will tell mindless ranting of mad people from actual issues, if anything, having a perfect background check via facebook would strike me as fake almost. I would expect to find at least something a bit off. Then again, I'm someone who got a job in retail oh so long ago based purely on confidence as I actually failed their little computer aptitude test lol, so maybe its just me.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to criticize, you make some very solid points, I just don't like it when people let fear stop them from trying to use newer tech. I'd rather not persoanlly end up like my folks who don't understand things like facebook fully because &quot;it's dangerous&quot; or &quot;it's beyond me to learn&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd use it if they somehow restricted it to an account &quot;display name&quot; so I could set it as my alias in game, or say my first name, first name last initial, etc etc.<br />
<br />
I agree with you in not wanting even online friends to know my last name. I know people in game that I would love to be able to RealID friend, but don't want knowing my name or my last name.<br />
<br />
Facebook implemented a very detailed privacy policy, so hopefully Blizzard can follow suit with this feature and add options that will enable you to restrict who sees your real name.<br />
<br />
If they do make this an option I'd be very pleased with RealID.</div></div><hr />

I usually fall into the part-time raider category. I've found that more often than not, that means &quot;If you're online and you wanna raid and we have a spot, you're taken over a pugger.&quot; I've also found that more often than not, when the RL knows one of my alts and I'm on it come raid time that night, I get tells asking me to log on that toon.

Being able to see all my &quot;RL&quot; friends' characters will save me like 6 spots on my friends list. Hooray?<br />
<br />
Also. I'm down with cross-realm chat. And I know they make way too much money off of server transfers. But What are the odds!... that I have friends on... multiple servers? I can't just transfer. To all of them. Sometimes I wanna run a random with these guys, but I can't. I'd hafta level a completely separate character, or abandon the friends I have on the server I'm already on.<br />
Pour a few buckets of money into the server architecture. Figure it out. If you can send packets across the network, you can do cross-realm (and cross-BG) grouping.<br />
<br />
Basically, I'm just... disappointed in how it's looking. I know it's not out yet, and I know they'll get massive QQ on every forum they check. But if enough people are satisfied with the way the system works, nothing will change... and this feature will remain useless to me. Bitter taste. Bleh. Waste of a programming team.<br />

A guild leader may encourage its members to add him/her as a friend, and by doing so be able to audit your activities. Don't feel like raiding, but want to do BGs on a different character instead? Too bad, your guild leader will know where you are, what you are doing and penalize you for missing raid for a non RL reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good.<br />
<br />
Get out of my raiding guild if you dont want to raid. So whats the problem here?</div></div><hr />

Like in other MMOs, even old Bnet had a similar system.<br />
<br />
(In short, you must ''accept'' when someone ask you to be in his friendlist.)<br />
<br />
Its not like the new armory doesn't break completly privacy anyway ::)</div></div><hr />

WoW is a video game, you're not supposed to make friends with others, you're supposed to just play the damn game with other people. It's bad enough they're adding that Facebook crap.<br />
<br />
<br />
/quit mmos please. We don't need people with this attitude.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Herecius</div><div class="date">2010-05-06, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People need to stop QQing. Real ID friends are SEPARATE from your WoW friendlist or Starcraft friendlist or (the inevitable) Diablo 3 friendlist. It is a specific Battle.net service and none of the friends that you have on those lists where you only know them by character name and vice-versa will suddenly get to see your real name.<br />
<br />
Stop complaining about a totally optional feature that doesn't hurt your WoW experience to never use in any way.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, grow a spine. Don't feel like raiding that night? Tell em. If they guild kick you, you were in the wrong guild, no matter how they progress. The fact that you'd lie to do bgs, ah, or cyber in the tram instead of raid, suggest you don't deserve your spot. Have an alt that you play when you don't want to be bothered? Let your RealID friends know that when you are on that alt, you don't want to do shit. Or never use RealID. Simple.<br />
<br />
Communication, that's where it begins. <br />
<br />
Anyway, see how it plays out and then you can bitch about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This, srs. I somehow doubt many people would agree to a crazy GL that demands everybody be on their Real ID list, anyways. And even so, you don't 'hide on another alt', that's stupid. If you're feeling burnt out from raiding, let the GL know. Don't be a wuss, just say something, or don't be in a guild with an attendance policy if it's such a problem.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trueStatic</div><div class="date">2010-05-06, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing about Real ID is they're treating it like this huge step forward. You'll be able to talk to your friends across multiple games! But they very pointedly state that it's for your REAL life friends.<br />
<br />
In the days before Warcraft 3, you could already talk to all your friends playing battle.net games no matter what game they were playing. This is a step back from that, where, if you want to talk cross game with someone, you share a lot of info with them. <br />
You give them your full real name, and email address.<br />
You give them access to you on ALL of your game accounts across all current Blizzard games.<br />
You give them access to your ENTIRE friends list.<br />
<br />
As it stands right now, you can't turn any of this on or off. At Blizzcon 2009, they said that with such a powerful feature with so much information, they'd have plenty of knobs and dials for privacy and parental controls. But the only privacy option currently apparent in Starcraft 2 is that if you don't want people to know every last detail about you, don't add them as a real id friend.<br />
<br />
I can respect that Blizzard wants to make a neat system for you to have easy access to your real friends with, that's cool. But it's just such a failing on so many levels that you have to give up all semblance of privacy for cross game chat - something we had a decade ago - without any of the flexibility they promised us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The way it's been outlined is the way it's going to work initially, and it's the way it will work permanently if no one complains about it.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has been pretty arrogant so far when talking about Bnet 2.0, how awesome it is, and they have been pretty oblivious to the objections to it.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean that they won't make lots of changes eventually, but right now they're just going to push it out like a steaming turd and see how it smells.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to chat with my friend while they are on a alt/sc2/d3 but giving out my real name is a nono. I can't understand all these Facebook and Myspace partygoes, the first thing a company does after you apply for a job is to invite you to an interview and if your still &quot;in&quot; they hire someone to get a background check the moment you left that door. Having co-workers in your list will also cause problems.<br />
<br />
There is only one Person i met on the internet who knows my name and i'd like to keep it that way, if it means i can't chat cross realm so be it. ALSO there is somthing called friend-of-friend system which is also in the RID you might want to read about that. So not only do you need to trust that online friend but also his friends.<br />
<br />
Gona make a fake bnet account for sc2/d3 maybe even wow but thats kinda hard since payment is involved. Also the need of giving out your Accountname for RID is pure stupidity</div></div><hr />

Got many real life buddies to add into this just like in steam, especially becouse we usually play different blizzard games.<br />
<br />
On the other hand this seems like crappy step after old b.net chat. Friends of Friends, no thanks its still gaming platform not society. No way to use nickname, why.. This would be cool tool with online friends as well and nickname is so much easier to use.</div></div><hr />

I mean... how special are your names really? Unless your name is &quot;Shishidirukon Batternattwarhemsdeli&quot; you can breathe easy, especially considering most of you are probably named &quot;Stephen Baker&quot; or such.<br />
<br />
If anything, go in and change your &quot;real name&quot; in the battle.net account settings if it's so damn terrible that a good friend of yours know your real name.<br />
<br />
Even if it's &quot;just a WoW friend&quot;, I'd hope that if it's someone you would otherwise consider giving realID information to - in the case that it didn't provide your real name - you can also trust that they won't turn into a stalker.</div></div><hr />
