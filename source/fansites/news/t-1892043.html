Warcraft Movie Interview<br />
Entertainment Weekly (http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/04/warcraft-duncan-jones-trailer-interview) and Collider (http://collider.com/charles-roven-warcraft-movie-atlas-entertainment-interview/) both had interviews about the Warcraft movie recently.<br />
<br />
Collider (http://collider.com/charles-roven-warcraft-movie-atlas-entertainment-interview/)<br />
<br />
The original script just told the story from the Alliance point of view. Duncan Jones came on and wrote the script to include both the Alliance and Horde points of view.<br />
The latest screenings of the movie have been extremely well received. <br />
The team is very satisfied with most of the movie, but they are still tinkering with it and going through the final process. <br />
<br />
<br />
Entertainment Weekly (http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/04/warcraft-duncan-jones-trailer-interview)<br />
<br />
Fans will get a unique enjoyment from the movies, as they will be able to identify the Easter eggs.<br />
The movie needed to be something you could watch even if you don't know anything about Warcraft while still making the players feel like it was their world. This is part of why the movie took so long. <br />
The BlizzCon crowd is the hardcore crowd, as they know the stories and world and are looking for a reflection of things they;ve experienced being in that world themselves.<br />
Comic book movies used to have a stigma associated with them too, but eventually filmmakers made movies that you actually cared about and felt something for. The same thing is going on with videogame movies now. <br />
The first trailer has to do a lot introducing, as the movie shows a new world and characters that people aren't familiar with yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard Hiring for Classic Games<br />
Blizzard posted a new position recently, hiring software engineers to fix up older games. This is likely related to the side project mentioned at Blizzcon 2013 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3545-World-of-Warcraft-Q-A) that was updating older games to run on current versions of Windows.<br />
Compelling stories. Intense multiplayer. Endless replayability. Qualities that made StarCraft, Warcraft III, and Diablo II the titans of their day. Evolving operating systems, hardware, and online services have made them more difficult to be experienced by their loyal followers or reaching a new generation.<br />
<br />
We’re restoring them to glory, and we need your engineering talents, your passion, and your ability to get tough jobs done.<br />
<br />
So if you like wearing many hats, know small teams are the most effective, and look forward to challenges that will create millions of new adventures for our players: we would love to hear from you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Make gameplay first again on modern operating systems.<br />
Create conditions for experiences that look as good as they play.<br />
Own implementation and curation of features new and old.<br />
Combat hacking to improve multiplayer.<br />
Diagnose and fix all the things: crashes, deadlocks, overflows, heap corruptions, etc. <br />
<br />

Blizzcon - Community Amphitheater<br />
There are several discussions going on at the Community Amphitheater at Blizzcon that won't be on the Virtual Ticket. We hope to be able to provide coverage of them, but it may not be live.<br />
Saturday, November 7, 12:15 p.m.<br />
Quick updates on Engineering discussion. First, it's a Q&amp;A discussion in the Darkmoon Faire area, not a panel on one of the panel stages. Second, it's gonna be at 12:15 on Saturday, and last for an hour. We'll be doing some of the questions we got from Twitter, and polling the audience. The engineers involved are myself, @ben_deane from http://Battle.Net , Timothy Ford from Overwatch, and Grant Mark from SC2/HOTS. We're super excited to do this, and we have a lot of good questions you've submitted. Thanks for your involvement. (kurtismcc (https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/656956435360710656))<br />
<br />
Friday, November 6, 2:45 p.m.<br />
Scott Johnson, host of The Instance Podcast (http://theinstance.net/), will be kicking off casual conversation with lead narrative designer Dave Kosak and lead quest designer Craig Amai about how the rich fantasy of the Warcraft universe informs their design approach to Legion, from quest flow to artifact weapons and beyond. Additional WoW designers will be on-hand and anxious to join the discussion!<br />
<br />
<br />
Featured Guests: Lead Narrative Designer Dave Kosak &amp; Lead Quest Designer Craig Amai<br />
Moderator: Scott Johnson, The Instance Podcast Host<br />
Special Guests: Designers Helen Cheng, Steve Danuser, Paul Kubit, Steve Burke, Jeremy Feasel, Juan Custer, Chadd Nervig, &amp; more<br />
<br />
<br />
Saturday, November 7, 2:30 p.m.<br />
Following up on the Legion game systems panel Saturday afternoon, lead class designer Kris Zierhut and his fellow members of the class/systems teams will be in the area to talk further with you about their presentation. If you plan on attending the main stage Q&amp;A panel at this time, we still recommend you come by afterward equipped with your questions for the developers!<br />
<br />
<br />
Featured Guest: Lead Class Designer Kris Zierhut<br />
Special Guests: Designers Chadd Nervig, Jonathan LeCraft, Russell Petersen, Jay Gill, Zachariah Owens, &amp; more<br />
<br />
<br />
If you’re not able to make these times, don’t worry! WoW developers will be hanging around the Darkmoon Faire throughout the weekend. Check with us at the Community Amphitheater anytime during BlizzCon for information on scheduled guest appearances.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
Do you think after Legion the WOW PVP Scene will be a major contender in the eSports Arena?<br />
No idea. Primarily focused on making it fun to play. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/659142803201486849))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
From what I got from you, demons are soulless right? How would they be animate then=[This is kinda confusing.<br />
That I have no idea about, some like Xavius had their souls torn apart by Sargeras right? But does every demonic being have one? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/658872322259079168))<br />
Well, according to some sources fel consumes souls. Then we have sources stating fel energy also burns life.<br />
Seems to be both, right? Some things consume soul shards, others use life to create mana, others use mana to kill life. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/658877029459361792))<br />
<br />
And if IIRC, the Nether is the realm of the dead?<br />
No idea, man. What is the Light? Where did that one dude in Icecrown go when he ascended? Do the Naaru live there? Deep stuff. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/658881073720500224))<br />
I have no idea lol =] Maybe there's two realm of the dead. Heaven and Hell-opps<br />
That's kind of the fun of Warcraft mysteries... (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/658881867987468288))<br />
I love mysteries=]I can't help but think that the Observers are related to Old Gods tho. Dem tentacles<br />
Old Gods are still super mysterious to me, I love their mythos and the creepy stained glass vibe. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/658882968967098368))<br />
<br />
Hey Dave, could we ever see a return of the Aspects?<br />
The dragonflights will continue to have a big influence on Azeroth! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/659443641811902464))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
was there ever discussion during your tenure to add housing to WoW?<br />
Concern was always that players stay in their houses and don't see other players. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/658704108333862912))<br />
<br />
One thing that I always wanted to ask I would really like an answer to: why do blizz nerfs always with the hammer? no scappel<br />
It can also be demoralizing to have a scalpel cut patch after patch after patch. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/658669743939809280))<br />
<br />
why do you think Blizzard abandoned their core Vanilla/BC/SC1/D1 and D2 player base in favour of 'accessibility'?<br />
I think &quot;abandoned&quot; is a very strong word. Blizzard has always strived for accessibility. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/659735883470385152))<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard - Japanese Game Localizations<br />
Blizzard updated the WoW, Diablo III, Overwatch, and Hearthstone websites to have a link to a Japanese version of the website. Obviously only Hearthstone has been released in Japanese (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/ja/) so far, so it is the only one that works. Blizzard has also been hiring for Japanese localization this year, along with two newer postings for a Project Manager (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/posting.html?id=15000T3) and Senior Marketing Manager (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/posting.html?id=15000T4). Keep in mind that none of this means that any other games are getting Japanese localizations.<br />

<br />
It's gonna be great, I do hope that we aren't just getting ''HD Remakes'' (Like Baldur's Gate, Dark Souls 2 etc.) but newer game engines that utilize our newer systems better. Hopefully we'll find out more this weekend, it's not like Blizzard to drop something like this just shy of a day before Blizzcon, without being ready to announce or tease something :P</div></div><hr />

There are rarely any good video game movies and the most recent ones have only been slightly better</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, because that would've gone over well with the fans (read; us)<br />
<br />
And it totally wouldn't just have looked like a Tolkien ripoff. <br />
<br />
Oh wait.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, you're not biased at all. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
The movie is half about the Horde and half about the Alliance, just like the game it's based on. That's a big part of what makes it unique -- not just the film, but the entire franchise. To ignore that would be betraying the property, and the fans.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What does &quot;well received&quot; mean, and by whom? How is this measured?<br />
Focus groups and test screenings, like with every movie. He contrasts it with earlier test screenings from before the VFX were implemented, where he said that the &quot;guys in pajamas&quot; wearing motion capture gear were distracting, and that it wasn't until they started implementing the CGI characters that people started to follow the story and emotionally connect to the characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lol, okay. What other video game movies would those be?<br />
That particular quote is actually out of context. The producer said that it's always great to be the first to do something, and their hope with Warcraft is that it'll be the movie that breaks the stigma.<br />
<br />
Atlas and Legendary are also producing a handful of other video game adaptations, which they obviously also hope will perform well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just an FYI, the guy they're interviewing has been a producer since the 80s. Not every film he's produced has been a winner, but most of them are. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0746273/</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Strakha</div><div class="date">2015-11-05, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anytime I hear 'introductions' in a movie i know its gonna be a trilogy, ill just wait for all 3 to be released on blu ray.<br />
<br />
i want to see the first one but it sounds like it will just be &quot;almost exciting&quot; and more of a &quot;you might see something better later&quot; type of tease. in essence an entire trailer of story we already know, that hopefully entices the non-aware to buy the ticket to the second showing.</div></div><hr />

It's also a differential. Place it from the Alliance's PoV, and people would go &quot;oh, it's a LotR rip-off&quot;. Have the other point of view, and not as glimpses of the eeeevil like in The Hobbit, and it's a different story.<br />
<br />
The latest screenings of the movie have been extremely well received.<br />
<br />
What does &quot;well received&quot; mean, and by whom? How is this measured?<br />
Test audiences. They get a bunch of people and invite them to see the movie. Happens with every movie. Sometimes, it's not well received, and they re-cut or re-shoot scenes, or add a few things back.<br />
<br />
The producer said that it's always great to be the first to do something, and their hope with Warcraft is that it'll be the movie that breaks the stigma.<br />
It's not Uwe Boll, so they have their chances...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnicton</div><div class="date">2015-11-05, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good god, the tweets about the legion.<br />
<br />
Stop with the weasel words Muffinus, just admit you guys never planned the mechanics behind the legion that far ahead.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Insofin</div><div class="date">2015-11-05, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's great that they're updating classic games to be played on new machines, even though I still have a W95 ready for when I want to play those games. That's also one step closer to having legacy WoW servers (vanilla, tbc, wotlk).<br />
<br />
Regarding the movie, I must admit I'm hyped, and I'm scared about how hyped I am. All previous videogame/anime movies have been, at best, a &quot;meh&quot;, making a really, really bad record in the genre. I hope the movie to be first one to actually be good and not a piece of cr*p, but I fear what would happen if the movie is not good...<br />
<br />
As for the PvP in Legion, I really hope PvP finally gets some serious attention and gets some balance and improvements. PvP to me is one of the two things that makes me play WoW from time to time.</div></div><hr />

Or they could take after the games that have done it right and not gate so much of your gameplay behind it. Player housing doesn't mean you give an incentive for people to stay in them all the time. Garrisons isn't player housing, it's WoW's failed take on it which is why it kept people away from the world.</div></div><hr />

They want to make compelling story about two different fantasy nations with their good and bad sides. Just don't take it too seriously. Whole retcon from Warcraft 3 to Warcraft 2 and 1 is pretty weird and there is not enough room to actually show &quot;horde&quot; (which doesn't exists at this point) in different light. So they really focused on notable (and even good) orc characters. Keep in mind, that goal of the movie is not make orcs look like a bad guys. The fact, that there is a war, but noone is really the bad guy make this story quite original. Or do you really think it is better to make another typical good vs bad fantasy movie?</div></div><hr />

It was always an excuse from the beginning, they just didn't want to do them. WoD did far more to split the player base than legacy realms would have done.<br />
<br />
Everquest's timelocked progression servers have apparently been a major hit, which is probably why we are seeing Blizz beginning to shift towards their classic line up of RTS games.</div></div><hr />

While I do agree GC was still on the Team when the concept was created, detailed and finalized before Blizzcon, it was changed a great deal after he left during Beta. It was supposed to be more of a side thing until they totally changed it during Beta to be more integrated with the story and questing (if I remember correctly). So yeah, it probably was a major concern and Garrisons were different before he left and than they totally butchered it into what we have today.</div></div><hr />

So you opted for garrisons, which are infinitely less-customizable than player housing would be.<br />

SWTOR got it right. I don't spend &quot;all my time&quot; in my house, but it's a cool place to decorate, customize, and invite others to.<br />

I agree! In addition, I thought the first Mortal Kombat wasn't bad either. Prince of Persia also wasn't terrible...<br />

I mean yes the only reason they are looking into updating the old games is so they can sell them yes. Next time you ask them for legacy servers tell Blizz you'd be willing to pay an extra sub fee!</div></div><hr />

The official response has always been in the direction of &quot;not at the moment&quot;, not &quot;never ever will happen&quot;. And sure, there's still a way to go, but they updating classic games just proves that their &quot;let's focus on new content&quot; is just weakening, and are starting to realize that old, outdated content can be useful.</div></div><hr />

Nah, the Japanese just usually doesn't like anything that isn't Japanese. Though having WoW released there wouldn't help much since the PC gaming scene isn't big there.</div></div><hr />

Duncan Jones came on and wrote the script to include both the Alliance and Horde points of view.<br />
<br />
Yeah, god forbid the Alliance get any story or focus. Even though it would have sold better to non-WoW players.<br />
<br />
The latest screenings of the movie have been extremely well received.<br />
<br />
What does &quot;well received&quot; mean, and by whom? How is this measured?<br />
<br />
Comic book movies used to have a stigma associated with them too, but eventually filmmakers made movies that you actually cared about and felt something for. The same thing is going on with videogame movies now.<br />
<br />
Lol, okay. What other video game movies would those be? (Also, I still think comic book movies suck, but that's personal taste.)<br />
<br />
This is pure marketing talking here. I listened to a podcast after the first footage was shown where the movie came up, and one of the hosts said that the reaction from the non-warcraft fans at Comicon was mostly 'Eh&quot;. <br />
<br />
The movie may do well. It's fine. I'm not that thrilled with how it looks, over design decisions, but that's me - that won't stop anyone else from liking it, and that's totally cool. We'll see what happens when it's released. Just keep in mind when the movie is discussed by Blizzard or Legendary or their agents, they're going to talk about it like it's the new Citizen Kane of fantasy movies - that's standard. <br />
<br />
It's like when Van Halen hired Gary Cherone to sing - great singer for Extreme, could be good. Eddie went on all kinds of interviews talking about how the album was the best thing they'd ever done, Gary is the best singer in the world, their songwriting had never been better, everyone who'd heard the album had their minds blown, best album since 1984, blah blah blah...the album comes out, and the fans hated it. They don't even talk about that era anymore. They just convinced Sammy to come back, and pretended the album never happened.<br />
<br />
The only thing that interests me is how much they're talking about what happened before Duncan came on board. Does the first version of the script matter? Why are they focusing on that? Strange. Probably just an ego thing, or politics, but it's unusual.<br />

<br />
Calm down, Francis. The D2 servers already exist, and are still running. They're just revamping the video quality and such of the clients. It's on a completely different scale from what you're throwing a fit over. They're not remaking D2, they're updating it to work in Windows 10 and Mac OS X El Capitan - which isn't the main issue with vanilla fucking servers.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I can already run the old games just fine. DOSBox for Warcraft 1 and 2 and Diablo II runs just the way it is (but you can use a glide wrapper like nGlide if you have problems). I would love to see Diablo II updated with higher resolutions and better textures though. Please make it so. :D<br />
<br />
From what they posted, I don't think they're going that far - if you read what's posted, what they're going to be doing is making them run in the new operating systems, increase the window size so you're not playing 800x600 on a 4k screen, and integrating it with Battle.net and your friend's lists, stuff like that - and combating hacking, which was always a huge issue in D2, and probably still is. <br />
<br />
It would be nice to re-polish the game, but the posting sounds like it's all technical updates and support, and they won't be touching art or content. That could be done with a couple of people working on it.</div></div><hr />
