Tell me more about these scripts and how I can use them to my advantage the next time I'm able to go to BlizzCon (Couldn't go this year, was trying to get tickets for a friend who got them anyway)<br />

13k / 4 = 4250 sales at minimum 13k at most, most likely it's somewhere around the mid, which means if you are above 6000 in q, you won't get any.</div></div><hr />

What the balls does that have to do with anything?<br />
<br />
Blizzard are selling them at $175 each. Once they are gone, they are gone. They don't hold any back to sell at higher prices later on.<br />
People on eBay are buying them at Blizzard's price and selling them at such sky rocketed prices. What is that? Like a 400% rise in price?<br />
<br />
Who mentioned anything about corporations? This is individual people exploiting individual people. Not giant conglomerates exploiting the masses.</div></div><hr />

Agreed.. I actually feel like I'm playing the game when trying to buy a ticket... getting fucked over every which-way...</div></div><hr />

They are fine selling it at that price and will let the free market handle all the nitty gritty of ensuring those who want to go most actually get to go. (Want to go most does directly translate into dollars, reasonably).<br />
<br />
Further, a lottery system would not necessarily improve anything. It would just improve the RANDOMNESS of the distribution, not the quality of it. It would lead to the same result.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I'm sure WoW is dying, Blizzard will break down and people just don't wanna go to Blizzcon as much as previous years.<br />
<br />
...Now I remembered that there WAS no Blizzcon 2012...So yeah, ? indeed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Technically it was 30 min, but in reality it was a few seconds, just took time to get through the queue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As it has never been changed since 2009 (the first year of the queue system...take that failbot of '08!!) you have been absolutely able to change the quantity of tickets at Checkout. The pull down menu has been and always will be a trap. <br />
<br />
Once you are at the checkout screen, pay attention to the yellow box area with your cart, ticket quantity, etc info. Immediately below that is a &quot;Change Quantities&quot; option which you click on, are able to input the quantity you want and then an &quot;Update&quot; button. You must hit the update button for your cart to register the change. Once it does, there you have it. <br />
<br />
The queue system has always been about HOW QUICK you can GET INTO the ticket queue, NOT about how quick with how every many tickets you get into the queue you are. Is it the perfect system? Probably not, but if you want to argue about how effed up of a system it is and how patently unfair it is, I submit as evidence in support of my argument..... the 2008 Blizzcon ticket sale process:<br />

<br />
Except it was less than one second before all tickets were reserved for people in the queue.<br />
<br />
It was thirty minutes for those ~5000 some people to get through the queue and check out. Not thirty minutes for those tickets to be claimed. They were claimed instantaneously. Stop grasping for straws.</div></div><hr />

Yep, that quantity drop down takes away the seconds you need. I learned that the first ticket batch few years back. You just have to remember to change it at Billing, not confirm order (which you cant).</div></div><hr />

No, there will not be a third round. Attendance is limited by venue size. I can assure you that they sold ~30000 tickets as they normally have in the past few years. Blizzcon is not a profit-maker for Blizzard, just a public even for the purpose of PR and announcements. If they were to increase attendance, they would have to book an expo center like the one in Las Vegas. This would create other issues. Anaheim is convenient because Blizzard can run shuttles out of its campus and have all-hands present to staff the convention. In Vegas Blizzard would have to pay out the nose to use local personnel as event staff or pay to bus/fly their own employees from Irvine.</div></div><hr />
