Our friends over at Vanion had the chance to talk to Tom Chilton again during Gamescom and came away with some interesting details. The highlights of the interview are below.

Gamescom Interview - Raid Release Schedule<br />
Our friends over at Vanion (http://www.vanion.eu/world-of-warcraft/news/video-interview-mit-lead-game-designer-tom-chilton-zu-warlords-of-draenor/10896/) had the chance to talk to Tom Chilton again during Gamescom and came away with some interesting details. The highlights of the interview are below.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;object width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;70&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;//www.youtube.com/v/eWGZNVzKKmM?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/v/eWGZNVzKKmM?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;70&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br />
<br />
Raids<br />
<br />
Raids will open roughly two and a half weeks after the expansion releases. This will give players time to level and enjoy some dungeons and other content before they move on to raiding.<br />
Normal and Heroic will open first, with Mythic and LFR starting to open the following week.<br />
Blackrock Foundry will open some number of weeks later. (4 weeks for MSV before HoF opened was too short - WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/500321613955334144))<br />
Grommash is really the final boss! When players get to the Grommash fight, they will see that it is a completely different fight from the Garrosh fight in Siege of Orgrimmar. <br />
There will be more than just Orcs in the raids. For example, there will be a heavy Legion influence in the raid that has Grommash Hellscream. <br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
The legendary items (other than the ring) will most likely come from defeating really difficult content. <br />
Warlords will have more activated trinkets compared to Mists of Pandaria.<br />
Challenge modes will reward players with transmog weapons for Gold, a mount for Silver, and a title for Bronze. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/500328114015051777))<br />
Challenge modes will have a daily quest that can reward Raid Finder quality loot. This will give players a reason to do Challenge modes while they wait for raids to open. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/500328114015051777))<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
<br />
Depending on what buildings your Garrison has, there will be different relevant content out in the world. <br />
If you build the Inn, you will have a dungeon daily quest in the Inn, similar to the Wrath of the Lich King dungeon daily quests. <br />
There are four tiers of Garrison missions for your followers, giving followers increased item levels and access to better missions each tier. Eventually you will have access to a mission that rewards raid quality loot every couple of weeks. <br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
Armistice Day is on the Tuesday of the release week, which is why they went with Thursday instead of Tuesday for release this time.<br />
The team has talked about doing an updated version of Karazhan, but it was created as a 10 player raid. There isn't space for 30 players.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gamescom Dev Interview<br />
Gamona (http://wow.gamona.de/) also had an opportunity to talk to Tom Chilton at Gamescom. The highlights of the interview are below.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;object width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;70&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;//www.youtube.com/v/eSGTk1Vsyj4?hl=en_US&amp;amp;version=3&amp;amp;rel=0&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/v/eSGTk1Vsyj4?hl=en_US&amp;amp;version=3&amp;amp;rel=0&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;70&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.0 is coming roughly a month before the November 13 release date.<br />
Warlords of Draenor took longer than anticipated to create, by roughly 6 months. Getting the new members of the team up to speed took longer than anticipated and slowed things down. A group is already working on the next expansion though, so hopefully there won't be another long gap next time.<br />
Moving your Garrison is still something that would be nice to do in a content patch. Players will most likely want the ability to move the garrison after they have had it in the same place for a few months. <br />
Rather than armor dyes, the team has made multiple color variations of armor sets and provided different ways for players to earn them. A dye system might cause the team to lose a little bit too much control over the way the world looks. Players coming into the game shouldn't see everyone wearing crazy neon colors or something like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
UK Subscription Price Increase - Secure Your Current Price for Two Years<br />
It looks like UK subscribers have a price increase coming, but players can lock in their price for two years if they keep their subscription active.<br />
<br />
<br />
30 Days - Increased to £9.99 from £8.99.<br />
90 Days - Increased to £28.17 from £25.17.<br />
180 Days - Increased to £52.14 from £46.14. <br />
<br />
<br />
We regularly look at our pricing around the world and from time to time we make changes in light of local and regional market conditions. As such, we want to give everyone a heads-up that we will shortly be adjusting the pound sterling subscription price of World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
The new price for recurring subscriptions will be £9.99 for 30 days, £28.17 for 90 days, and £52.14 for 180 days. The suggested retail price of the 60-day prepaid time card will be £20.99.<br />
<br />
As a thank you for current World of Warcraft subscribers, we guarantee that players with recurring (auto-renewing) subscriptions at the time of the price change will retain their current price for two years, as long as they remain in the same recurring subscription without interruption. This applies to anyone who is already in, or signs up for, a recurring subscription prior to the price change, which is scheduled to take place at the Warlords of Draenor release. We will reach out to relevant players approximately two months prior to the price change with a reminder.<br />
<br />

They won't mind that happening. They've always said there are drop offs at the end of every expansion. It's a good time to take a break.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be fun, if we were to team up with Iron Horde against Legion and in the last fight Grom would eventually help us... (and in the epic cinematic he dies while delivering a killing blow to....Kil'jaden? Archimonde should be dead or banished imo. (*SPOILER IN NAGRAND ALERT*)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">UnifiedDivide</div><div class="date">2014-08-15, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's amazing how the mere mention of demons makes people forget other things going on.<br />
<br />
We're still going to be fighting an Orc as the final boss. Not just an Orc though! A Hellscream! What? We literally just did that?! Oh, but he'll be demonically powered?! Cool! I kinda just did that in a way too... Ah...</div></div><hr />

As far as I remember, they said &quot;The final boss won't be just an orc.&quot; With the Legion's presence, who can tell what will happen in that raid?</div></div><hr />

They didn't say it wouldn't be an orc. NOT JUST AN ORC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I knew it! When they said at Blizzcon not JUST an Orc, they probably meant a fel juiced up orc.<br />
<br />
I'm now more inclined than ever to think that the final raid will have Grom drinking the blood in desperation after we booted the other Warlords and leading an attack on Stormwind with heavy legion backing.</div></div><hr />

I like to think that, no matter how hard you try, some things in the timeline are fixed (Thrall escaping Durnholde, Arthas culling Stratholme, Medivh opening the Dark Portal) and can't be changed. Time will find a way to fix itself, and this is probably how it'll go down.<br />
<br />
(But if the Legion is in full force at the end game, does this mean we'll FINALLY get Turalyon and Alleria in the next expansion? I've been waiting since Cataclysm!)</div></div><hr />

Maybe. Who knows what the story is going to be?<br />

Heck, it could be that Grom HELPS us take on the Legion but always says that if they succeed he's still our enemy. So once the Legion is delt with, we square off with Grom.<br />

<br />
As far as I'm aware, the pound is relatively strong at the moment - $1.67 to the pound, we got down to $1.50 or so about a year back - see the following image:<br />
<br />
http://i62.tinypic.com/jucxua.png<br />
<br />
If I were more cynical, I would suggest that this is a way of keeping people paying for the next few months prior to WoD (since the price will remain locked for 2 years if subscriptions are maintained)... But I wouldn't ever suggest anything like that :P<br />
<br />
Edit: For further reference, the pound is reasonable against the euro as well - €1.25 to the pound compared to €1.15 a year ago, see:<br />

A year ago £1 was worth $1.55, today its worth $1.67, the rate within the last couple months or so is the highest its been since 2007, so that's is in no way a justification for the increase now.<br />
<br />
Our economy has recently recovered to the point it was at pre-worldwide crash, so maybe they are taking advantage of that, who knows.<br />
<br />
Or more likely its fishing to keep people subbed or get them to resub before the price increases come in, but why only the UK if it was that?</div></div><hr />

I assume the rest of europe will see it increase soon too, I agree with the cynical view of JebJoya to keep sub numbers up. Although saying that I would imagine the UK as a whole compared to say places that use the Euro or the Dollar as their sub currency is a considerably smaller proportion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pound against the Dollar hasn't really changed much. The UK traditionally suffers quite a high mark-up on imported goods. Since people have gotten used to paying over the odds for stuff, the UK market is generally seen as somewhere you can inflate your prices.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: The UK is getting milked because our market has learned to bear it.</div></div><hr />

Point was that the pound is worth more dollars than it was a year ago, so if the prices are going up because of the pound falling against the dollar why now and not a year ago when it was worth less.<br />

Agreed though, with £8.99 being the price it has been cheaper than €12.99 and $14.99 with the exchange rates for a while.</div></div><hr />

I like this schedule. ToT came out in March and lasted until September 10th. So around 6 months. If they don't drop 6.2 until, say, May (3-4 months of Blackrock) they could release the final tier right after Blizzcon 2015. That could put the next expansion as being announced at the con with plenty of time after the con to keep working internally while we're still clearing the final tier. Unlike the current tier which had already been cleared by the time Blizzcon 2013 happened and people were clamoring for the beta ASAP.</div></div><hr />

£8.99 almost exactly $15 at the moment. With the price increase we're effectively paying $16.70. Still not as bad as the continent though, they're paying the equivalent of $17.40.</div></div><hr />

these are really great news :) im very curious about how they are implementing movable garrisons. they will probably have 1-3 possible places each zone - thats enough.

First rise in 10 years, and UK only. Considering the shocking state of the UK economy (ignore the politicians) its not hard to see why the price is being raised - the pound just isn't worth as much as it used to be.<br />

<br />
Probably does, yeah. That's another contributing factor, VAT was raised a few years ago (despite politicians saying it wouldn't be).<br />
<br />
<br />
Erm what? its worth a lot more than the Euro at the moment and so what about first raise in 10 years? there's also been other sub games released (as recently as 2 months ago with Wildstar) that have a 8.99 fee, you don't see them needing to raise the price.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day its £1, its not the price that annoys me its the cheek of announcing a raise when they have done fuck all to the game for the best part of a year, its a joke to be honest.</div></div><hr />

I grinned and beared all that nonsense and looked on the positive side - but to add an increase on sub fees? I hope the majority of the UK boycott it and tell Blizz to shove it up their dark portals. Not much of an increase but considering the game i paid to enjoy back in the days of Wrath, to now paying MORE for a game i am growing to view as a bit of a burden, laughable. been on the sidelines over Wildstar lately, may go give that a whirl.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hold it; Blizzard is the one who is having a problem with some colors. They're also the same people who would get to decide which colors they'd allow us to use in a potential armor dying feature. The incredibly stupid thing is, they're saying they won't implement armor dyes because they don't want they themselves to put in &quot;crazy neon colors.&quot; Then don't, you fools! The feature would still be awesome and super useful without any available colors being crazy or neon. Like the one you replied to said, they want all their white armor to be the same shade of white--is that so bad? Is that crazy to you? Would that turn off new players? Would you freak the eff out if you saw that in-game? Huh? Do you seriously think that should &quot;simply not be in the hands of the wow community&quot;? If you're afraid of the game being broken over something so utterly benign as freakin' matching shades of white, then... I'm at a total loss for words.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then hiring 80 was maybe an error to begin with.<br />
<br />
When you're a multimillion dollars company like they are, you are supposed to plan ahead, hiring 80 people out of the blue doesn't come as a surprise that it would slow them down as they have to &quot;train them&quot; (well, if they really have to, guess they hired the wrong people).<br />
<br />
A mistake like this is not a &quot;tiny mistake&quot;, especially for a company like this, seriously, who wouldn't have though, in their right mind, that hiring 80 people would slow them down ?<br />
<br />
And a 6 month late on a deadline ? Lolwut ? If you are that far behind schedule, you have to put the management in question, and not just slap them on their wrist, failling to plan a 6 month delay in business (seriously 6 months ?? I'm baffled by this) would mean job faillure and instantly fired.</div></div><hr />

After hearing all Blizzard's excuses about 'not enough employees to deliver quality content at a decent pace', anyone that complains about them hiring TOO MANY people needs to take a long walk off a short pier.<br />

True 6 months is long as hell, but you hire someone in computer graphics doesn't mean they know WoW graphics, they had to teach them how they like their style of computer art, where the differences are, all the coding in the game they use(10 years worth of codes, old ones and new ones), that is going to take time. Rarely do people just jump right into a major job and hit it running. Now imagine doing this with 80 people, finding out what their strengths are. You test them in multiple areas, find out what suits them best then place them there. They then go into higher levels of learning that specific skill set. Yes I think 6 moths was still to long but I see where it would take some time. Hopefully with all these people now fully in and trained the next x-pac comes out quicker when this one is done, IF it doesn't then I could really say they messed up more than they have.<br />

<br />
Gona say the price rise is pretty reasonable given this, £8.99 in 2004 is £12.40 today so with the price rise the annual sub will still cost less then at any point up untill about 2011/2012<br />
<br />
Add in the fact that Blizz operates its administrations (pays most its staff etc) in Euros or USD, GBP is a secondary currency, which means there are transaction costs attached to letting people pay in £, which you need to factor into any reasonable comparison of end user subscription fee: it costs more for blizzard to acept subscriptions in GBP than Euros or USD <br />

Somebody said they would pay $20/month in order to play the zero content you'll have received for the 14 months between SoO and the expansion release. That's $280 for zero content. Then $50 for the new content. So, for all of that new content you listed off, $330.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
If you paid 8.99 at release or any time since, you have paid, in real terms, less every year for your subscription. <br />
<br />
Gona say the price rise is pretty reasonable given this, £8.99 in 2004 is £12.40 today so with the price rise the annual sub will still cost less then at any point up untill about 2011/2012<br />
<br />
Add in the fact that Blizz operates its administrations (pays most its staff etc) in Euros or USD, GBP is a secondary currency, which means there are transaction costs attached to letting people pay in £, which you need to factor into any reasonable comparison of end user subscription fee: it costs more for blizzard to acept subscriptions in GBP than Euros or USD <br />

We're talking abour British Pound Sterling here not Euro. 28,17 £ is $47,03 so it's 5 dollar more expensive. Comparison the EU price is 35,97€ that's $48,20. Once again EU is the most expensive. Just like with Steam.<br />

Armistice Day? Didn't he mean Veteran's Day? Maybe i should watch the video,lol<br />

Armistice Day IS Veteran's Day. Just different names depending on countries. To be honest not really a reason to change the release date, but whatever.</div></div><hr />

After hearing all Blizzard's excuses about 'not enough employees to deliver quality content at a decent pace', anyone that complains about them hiring TOO MANY people needs to take a long walk off a short pier.<br />
Well look, they've obviously gone about their recruitment process wrong if they've hired an extra 80 people over the usual and still somehow ended up taking 6 months longer than they anticipated to push the expansion out. <br />
<br />
All those new staff members must be feeling pretty shitty about themselves now they're publicly getting the blame for all the delays.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine putting a team on the next expansion is helping either. But that just reinforces that what we're really getting here is one half of an expansion. They're probably holding a lot back for the second half.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish they had either made the Scenarios live up to their promises or - if they DO - make it more obvious. Anybody else remember how scenarios were going to have more interactive NPCs and problems that could be solved in multiple ways? I never really saw much of that. Again though, maybe I just missed it - often you enter a heroic scenario and everybody kinda looks at each other, goes &quot;Yep we're badasses&quot; and then it turns into my favorite scene from Predator, where they mow down a large swath of forest.<br />
<br />
Using Scenarios for story telling is awesome though, I'm really glad they're continuing that.</div></div><hr />

And yes while in WC3 he had been captured by humans, not only was this an older, more experienced, more patient AND MERCIFUL version of Grom(in the lord of the clans book his clansmen had captured a young human boy and wanted thrall to kill him as an initiation ritual, but Grom stopped them, telling them that they dont kill defenseless children, asked the boy if he would tell anyone about where they were, which he of course said no to, and told them to take him to a road and leave him UNHARMED, or he would slay whoever harmed him), but when he had been captured by the alliance so had the entirety of his clan, and while the clan could live on without him were he alone captured or killed, it could not if they were all captured and killed in a hair brained escape attempt by themselves, meaning he couldnt just attempt to escape and possibly die in the proccess, and instead had to wait. This Grom however does not know the patience and mercy that our Grom learned in the 20 years btwn the fall of the Old Horde and the rise of the new, he wouldnt allow himself to be captured. He would never ally himself with the legion since he knew it meant enslavement. The original Grom nvr knew they were enslaved by the legion, only learning it after he drank the blood of mannoroth a 2nd time to defeat Cenarius, after which Mannoroth told them it meant their enslavement. He never would have drinken once nor twice had he known. During those 20 years he realized that the bloodlust had controlled, even enslaved them to the urges, but never knew how far it went. This Grom learned b4 he drank, and would never allow himself to be the Legion's pawn.

Probably does, yeah. That's another contributing factor, VAT was raised a few years ago (despite politicians saying it wouldn't be).<br />
<br />
In the EU, you pay VAT (think sales tax) in the member state where the business is located, not where the customer is located. If you pay online for a WoW subscription, then you pay the VAT in the country where Blizz EU is based (I thought it was France but somebody else mentioned Ireland).<br />

On another note, I'm seriously face-palming at the price-increase. I'm still amazed at how much content we got for Mists, and now going ahead they're asking for even more money (both for the xpac itself &amp; now also for the sub) for the most lacklustre xpac yet. SMFH.<br />

No its not the currency, is most likely to do with the tax change they are bringing in which effects suppliers of telecoms, broadcasts and digital content.

Garrosh has already been born in this AU. Also anyone else think it's sad using the term AU for a game? AU should only be used in people's fan fiction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get the feeling that at this point Garrosh is much more concerned with vengeance than giving glory to the old Horde. There might still be some part of him that wants to help his father, but at this point he's fairly irredeemable. He's mostly just helping the Warlords organise so that they'll go do his bidding and fsck up Azeroth.<br />
<br />
It's possible that when we steam-roll the Iron Horde that Garrosh will turn to the power of the Legion in a last desperate attempt for vengeance. In that case we could be teaming up with Gromm to take down a fel infused Garrosh.<br />
<br />
It's very unlikely, not least because that'd make Garrosh the end boss of two consecutive expansions. Still, every time I've watched the trailer I can't help but draw comparisons with Medivh when Garrosh is standing around all hooded and mysterious. If Garrosh is indeed under the influence of the Legion then his actions would somewhat mirror Medivh's. A hero of their respective faction gets corrupted by the Legion, opens a portal to Draenor and encourages the Orcs to go on a rampage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well it is somewhat surprising seeing as how this panda/chinese themed expansion's final boss was an orc. It shows that Blizzard can have a completely different final boss from the initial theme and could all work out. Also, not using Grom would be in line with their earlier statement that the final boss of WoD wouldn't be an orc. However, it seems that yet another internal problem arose in Blizz and they changed it to Grom. Shame really.</div></div><hr />

And that happened in Warcraft 3. That cinematic was set before Warcraft 1, which is approx 20-25 years BEFORE Warcraft 3. C'mon it says 35 years ago in the cinematic! Know your lore people! I don't understand why people keep confusing those events. It's not even remotely similar to what happened in Warcraft 3. The Orcs arn't even the same colour! <br />
<br />
Killing Grom, even in the past wouldn't fix anything. Y'know, because they've already not drunk the blood, Garrosh wasn't there, they didn't have Iron Horde technology and plenty of other stuff that didn't ever happen. The orcs arn't even attempting to invade for the first war, they're attemping to invade NOW. Killing Grom in the past would just further pollute the timeline, as there would be a man dead who was alive before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I think this is something people need to really come to grips with. 5 and 10 levels are arbitrary numbers. The real numbers come from the amount of XP needed to achieve a level along with the amount of XP given per accomplishment (harvesting, questing, killing mobs, exploration, etc.) If the 5 levels need a total of 5 million XP, but you're only getting an average of 500 XP per accomplishment while 10 levels need a total of 10 million XP and you're getting 2,000 XP per accomplishment, it's going to take longer to attain that 5 level goal as opposed to the 10 level.<br />
<br />
So the claims that 10 levels automatically means longer leveling than 5 is dumb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's a damn stupid argument. Being able to afford it doesn't make an 11% increase in price justified. We're receiving no more content than we used to, the cost of running the servers has done nothing but fall since the game was initially released and the value of the Pound is higher than its been for nearly 6 years.<br />
<br />
I could easily afford to pay £100 per month to play WoW. If they increased the sub that high would you still be parroting this nonsense?</div></div><hr />

Thankfully the original video and quotes have been posted to expose the bullshit some of you are posting. <br />
<br />
I've done it all. Being the GM of a very large, top tier raiding guild in vanilla through bc, bring it down to a tighter group in wrath and cata, and spending more time doing personal things and friendship things in MoP. Each and every period was great but I do not long to go back to the past. We all know more about the game now. What kept up entertained would not work now. The sheer amount of grinding in the past would dramatically drop subscriptions at this point as people have moved on. If original WoW came out today, it would not be the success it was again. Times have changed and the expectation of people have changed.<br />
<br />
So far, I'm enjoying WoD. I've been in beta the whole time. There are lots of nice mechanics, the polish is good, the questing is pretty awesome with lots of new additions and tweaks. Many of the old-style grinding quests are now optional content that shows only when you're in a given area. The garrisons are fun and have great potential for the future as they continue to iterate. Dungeon and Raid content has some interesting mechanics that is a bit inconsistent at the moment for difficulty but that will be nailed out. There are a LOT of changes and a lot of improvement in the game to found.<br />
<br />
WoW is one of the &quot;greats&quot; because of this passion so many have. That's a great, great thing. But it's important to remember things in reality. So many are overlooking things. They're overlooking that past expansions had LOTS of content cut and axed. They're overlooking the countless issues and broken features that were patched and fixed much later. They're overlooking single mode raids. They're conveniently forgetting the randomness, not talent, involved in so many of the things folks like to brag about. I could go on for days. We all know this is true. BC is so fondly remembered because of the time and distance we have from it now. There were plenty of issues and drama at the time. <br />
<br />
One of the best things the whiners could do is make *constructive* posts on Blizzard's forums or even use the feedback mechanisms provided. Then, vote with your wallet. Just let the game go for a while. If you're truly that unhappy and that sick of things, show them by not playing. (And don't point to overarching trends in subscribers to make your point, any game that is 10 years old is going to be waning, regardless of how good it is.) When you unsubscribe, point out why in intelligent terms. Don't resort to exaggerations and dramatic language. Make it simple and clear and support it with facts, not hyperbole.<br />
<br />
In the end, it's a game. Yes, that old annoying phrase. But it is true. As it is a game, when you no longer find it fun, you move on to other games or do other things with your free time. Resorting to ridiculous and misleading comments in a random forum is not helpful and is akin to political junkies posting in echo chamber forums.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Inexperienced players are more likely to pick whichever trinket they like the best. Experienced players will choose whichever trinket is proven to be the best DPS/HPS/Damage Mitigation booster. Either way, at maximum, it will add two buttons to your bar that you will only use, at best, once a minute. And they will typically not be redundant aside from boosting the flavor of your role. It definitely doesn't fly in the face of ability pruning. Considering you could already equip two on-use trinkets, I'm not sure what the big deal is. Make more of them and give more choice, but keep the number of keybinds the same. Adds the ability to differentiate yourself even more.</div></div><hr />

MoP was far more casual than any other expansion. I'm not particularly sure what you believe the term &quot;casual&quot; means. Aside from the serious lack of 5 mans, there was a ton of content with scenarios and dailies (ugh) and you were able to see every single raid in the expansion with LFR.<br />
<br />
But by, what seems to be, your definition, TBC was the least casual friendly expansion and it gained 4 million subscribers.</div></div><hr />

Casual yes, alt-friendly no, not during 5.0. They've backslid a bit, but for example my alt mage has enchanting but none of the 'good' enchants because those require rep and I WILL BE GOD DAMNED TO HELL IF I WILL DO THOSE DAILIES AGAIN.</div></div><hr />

Enchanting recipes aren't really content. The content is what leads you to getting those enchanting recipes. There was a lot of casual friendly content. Some of the necessary steps in achieving some rewards weren't particularly alt friendly. But what does that have to do with how casual friendly the expansion was?</div></div><hr />
