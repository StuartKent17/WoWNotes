Blizzcon Digital Bonuses Code<br />
The Digital Bonuses Codes went out to Blizzcon ticket holders today. These codes give you a Virtual Ticket, access to In-Game goodies, and the online sale. So far, we know that Murkidan (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/10322-murkidan) will be one of the in-game (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/85009-dwarf-gronnling) rewards. <br />
<br />
Don't forget that attendees can buy an extra Goody Bag this year! Also new this year, Virtual Ticket holders will have a chance to buy a BlizzCon Goody Bag of their own. No word on what will be in it this year, but you can get an idea by looking at last year's bag (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4474-Blizzcon-2014-Day-0-Goody-Bag).<br />

Patch 6.2 Hotfixes - August 17<br />
Users on the forum noted this change this weekend, mentioning getting 500 - 600 gold per bag (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1844851-Savage-Satchel-of-Cooperation?p=35621521&amp;viewfull=1#post35621521).<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
Loot Buff for Call to Arms<br />
<br />
Savage Satchel of Cooperation (http://www.wowdb.com/items/128803-savage-satchel-of-cooperation), awarded for completing a class role that's in demand through Dungeon Finder or Raid Finder received a boost to its contents.<br />
<br />
Increased the amount of gold awarded by over 200%!<br />
The satchel now has a chance for additional Baleful tokens, Empowered Apexis Fragment (http://www.wowdb.com/items/128225-empowered-apexis-fragment), and Medallion of the Legion (http://www.wowdb.com/items/128315-medallion-of-the-legion).<br />
<br />
<br />
Hellfire Citadel<br />
Xhul'horac<br />
<br />
Omnus's Singularity damage can now be reduced by damage reduction effects on Raid Finder difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Annihilator should no longer have a chance to trigger its on hit effect on targets that are above level 63.<br />
Fixed an issue where Rancorbite Mail Agility 4-piece set bonus was not correctly scaling its damage down in Timewalking dungeons.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Mounts<br />
That moose mount is great. Please say it can fly. Always wanted a flying moose.<br />
Yea it can! The feet glow with blue-green dream dust (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/631680429515386880))<br />

PvP<br />
Another reminder that I make no announcements &amp; answer no questions about WoW on twitter. Be wary of malicious fake accounts trolling you. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/631950750050988032))<br />
<br />
been doing alot of BGs lately and I gotta say Horde has majorly bought into a defeatist &quot;groupthink&quot;. They don't even try anymore.<br />
The groupthink problem is a tremendous challenge (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/631631845101211648))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Classes<br />
specifically ret I was getting tuned constantly why did it need such an overhaul? What was the mindset there?D<br />
Low skill ceiling. There wasn't a way to really get better by playing more, which was always going to keep their dps down. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/623133763233447936))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
everyone thinks sun well wasn't planned and was a band-aid. Can you confirm it was part of the original BC plans or not?<br />
I think it was added when LK ended up taking longer. I may be wrong. I don't trust my memory on that. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/626544972137762816))<br />

<br />
Yeah. It was even a seemingly more integrated part of the story than BT was. T6.5 gear felt a bit slapped on but the lore would have been shot through with a cannon if all of what happened at the Sunwell didn't actually happen. Ruby Sanctum was a filler bridge raid, no way Sunwell was.</div></div><hr />

you shouldn't have an opinion if you voice it like that. reported.<br />
on topic i think the rewards are extremely too high. Ok i can get they want to reward those specs but for the love of god, way to ditch 90% of playerbase.</div></div><hr />

Getting those rewards is as easy as relogging to an alt.<br />
<br />
Seeing how we are playing the World of Altcraft since forever, and hearing how everyone is bragging how they are &quot;making 50k golds per weak on my 10 alts without leaving the garrison lol&quot; - I don't see this as a problem for anyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they just stopped releasing straight up broken content. All the way up to Ulduar(that's the last zone I remember with a boss that was flat out broken and unkillable at release) they pretty regularly released bosses that could not be killed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is one stupid statement. Pretty sure my guild wouldn't be as far as it is in HFC without the dps. Also, quit making yourself look like a complete jackass by elevating yourself over others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll guess $100<br />
<br />
Sure there is a lot of &quot;value&quot; in the bag (I've been to Blizzcon, I live in SoCal,) but if you see all of the things that go into a blizzcon (outside of the vendors that pay to have a booth inside, and then food vendors outside who charge 10 bucks for a chicken sammich i used to eat in public elementary school) there is no way I would want 1/3 of my ticket's cost to be represented by some junk. <br />
<br />
That being said, the blizzard store at the'con had many items and they aren't cheap (not discounted from regular price, which they should be since you paid to get in and had to smell all of the fart clouds.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing that the list does miss is the nuance between 10M and 25M difficulties. Some 10 M hc bosses went down before the 25 man counterparts and vice versa. Also need a reminder of who actually got Garrosh 25M first - Method or some guild in TW / CN region?</div></div><hr />

DPS SIGNIFICANTLY outnumber Tanks and Healers. That's why DPS ques are so long. When DPS aren't so numerous, you can bet they'll give rewards to DPS for playing DPS.</div></div><hr />

If you choose to play the same role as 90% of the playerbase, you also choose not to get the optional rewards offered for people who *choose* to play roles with more responsibility, and who take more crap from groups/raids for how well they play.

Why would you trust Blizzard on that? They couldn't find the truth if it bit them in the ass. &quot;Oh we'll NEVER allow that. Oh wait we just did.&quot; for like a dozen different features. &quot;Oh that was never meant to be launch content even though we said it was!&quot; <br />
<br />
From the Blizzcon that BC was announced all the hype was about Illidan. All of it. Giant Illidan statues, You are Not Prepared everywhere, it was all about Illidan and the Black Temple. Nothing that came before that, nothing mentioned about anything coming after that. Nada. And then Black Temple didn't last as long as they wanted it to. It lasted quite awhile, because it was gated, but Illidan was killed the same week that his area of Black Temple was released. Which was a first for raid bosses in WoW btw. I've seen the list on the forum that, at least used to, imply that Illidan took awhile to be killed, but the time between when he was actually fight-able until the time he was dead was one reset. I know I was horribly disappointed at the time. <br />
<br />
And Blizzard went &quot;SHIT!&quot;, threw together some Blood Elf architecture assets, reused a ton of models, threw together the additional pieces of the T6 &quot;sets&quot;, and released Sunwell. It was lazy, it was sloppy, it was obviously thrown together, but it was fun. I'm personally glad to see Ghostcrawler admit that it was tacked on later. BT not lasting long enough, LK taking too long, fair enough that they threw together a placeholder raid like Sunwell.</div></div><hr />

Our guild has always had a problem with not having enough DPS, almost everyone wants to play a healer or a tank. <br />
Most of the time, half our DPS are offspecs. We're currently on a break from raiding because even with offspecs, we don't have enough people who want to dps. &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

NAh, I don't buy that last part. The entire patch was too much work to throw together like that. They admitted they sold the story wrong, that there was too much emphasis on Illdan, and the Sunwell was announced too late. Lets be honest, they were learning as they went (as they still are), and they were still rough around a lot of edges back then. And, he said he could be wrong - and I think he might be - not that it matters, the usual suspects will cite that as 100% undeniable proof, even though GC hedged on being right. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I give up believing anything, anymore. I was just laughing that GC just threw a couple of big, dry logs onto a fire that was almost out. It's funny. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
C'mon, there's a VAST gulf of difference between a guild environment and pugging - the comments are about pugging, really. Sure, in my old guild, you could try tanking and healing and not get beat up too much, it was a stable environment for that kind of thing, and the friendship we all had was supportive. In pugs? Forget it - one mistake and the raid throws themselves on the floor crying and kicking their feet. I would never, ever, ever, even if you paid me real money heal or tank a pug. It's just not worth it, which is why it's rare. I knew too many tanks and healers who said they'd never tank or heal outside of their guild ever again, because of what they went through.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It also suggests that fewer tanks/healers are running dungeons/LFR because 1) at this point in the ex-pac most are done and need little or nothing from any of these instances and/or 2) the subscriber count is continuing to decline and there are fewer tanks/healers around, to begin with, that are needed to complete these runs.</div></div><hr />

Half the time I see the reward on my healer, I queue. And by the time the queue actually pops, the reward is gone, and I get nothing. It should LOCK IN the second you queue - your presence is making that group assemble faster. It's just badly-designed all around.</div></div><hr />

Your expectations are way out of calibration. A nice canvas embroidered messenger bag and inflatable zealot psi-blade is hands down one of the best goodie bags in years. <br />

This was up for a brief time before it was abruptly taken down, and the link is now dead.<br />
For those of you already complaining that it's going to be super expensive.<br />
<br />
As someone who attended BlizzCon the last 2 years, this is hands down the best goodie bag people have gotten in years. The messenger bag alone is worth the price tag, but the goodies inside are fun as well. (As you can see, right beside this item in the links, the WoW 10th Anniversary Bag is 35$ by itself.)<br />
<br />
I'm actually a huge fan of the pricing as this means Virtual Ticket + The Goody Bag will cost someone roughly 100$ USD after its been shipped and everything. Someone who went to BlizzCon paid 200$ for their ticket... so 100$ more to actually be in attendance is a fair price.<br />
<br />
Certainly beats the Mur'Ghoul + Trinkets and the 2013 Bag which was only the Cute But Deadly figures.</div></div><hr />

The entire patch was too much work to throw together like that. They admitted they sold the story wrong, that there was too much emphasis on Illdan, and the Sunwell was announced too late. Lets be honest, they were learning as they went (as they still are), and they were still rough around a lot of edges back then. And, he said he could be wrong - and I think he might be - not that it matters, the usual suspects will cite that as 100% undeniable proof, even though GC hedged on being right. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I give up believing anything, anymore. I was just laughing that GC just threw a couple of big, dry logs onto a fire that was almost out. It's funny. :)<br />
<br />
The Sunwell patch came out almost a year after BT. In most expansions, that is the time between the last tier and the next expansion. They had plenty of time to make a small island, a dungeon, and a 6 boss raid. I don't know if it was planned early on or not, but it looks like it wasn't. <br />
<br />
Of course I wish they still released some content between the planned last raid and the next exp when the development gets too long. Cata would have been less horrible if they were able to put something together so we had something to do besides 9 boss DS for the longest time.</div></div><hr />

Well the gamergate thread is still going strong on this site so what do you expect?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nnelson54</div><div class="date">2015-08-18, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would you trust Blizzard on that? They couldn't find the truth if it bit them in the ass. &quot;Oh we'll NEVER allow that. Oh wait we just did.&quot; for like a dozen different features. &quot;Oh that was never meant to be launch content even though we said it was!&quot; <br />
<br />
From the Blizzcon that BC was announced all the hype was about Illidan. All of it. Giant Illidan statues, You are Not Prepared everywhere, it was all about Illidan and the Black Temple. Nothing that came before that, nothing mentioned about anything coming after that. Nada. And then Black Temple didn't last as long as they wanted it to. It lasted quite awhile, because it was gated, but Illidan was killed the same week that his area of Black Temple was released. Which was a first for raid bosses in WoW btw. I've seen the list on the forum that, at least used to, imply that Illidan took awhile to be killed, but the time between when he was actually fight-able until the time he was dead was one reset. I know I was horribly disappointed at the time. <br />
<br />
And Blizzard went &quot;SHIT!&quot;, threw together some Blood Elf architecture assets, reused a ton of models, threw together the additional pieces of the T6 &quot;sets&quot;, and released Sunwell. It was lazy, it was sloppy, it was obviously thrown together, but it was fun. I'm personally glad to see Ghostcrawler admit that it was tacked on later. BT not lasting long enough, LK taking too long, fair enough that they threw together a placeholder raid like Sunwell.<br />
<br />
What an awesome revisionist history you've got there.<br />
<br />
Sunwell was obviously meant to be the end of it from the start. The ENTIRE EXPANSION was about the Blood Elves, Draenei and the Burning Legion. Even before Black Temple was released you had Kael'thas shouting in Shattrath about bringing his true master to Azeroth when you handed in his &quot;death&quot; quest after Tempest Keep. Illidan was barely a footnote in any zone except for Hellfire Ramparts(where you find a note from him for a quest) and Shadowmoon Valley(where Black Temple was located), while we followed the Blood Elf/Draenei/Burning Legion story the entire expansion. <br />
<br />
They hyped up Illidan to sell boxes because he was their first famous villain they were using. Nothing more. He was clearly never intended to be the final boss.</div></div><hr />

Implying that someone that calls a woman &quot;A youtube wh*re&quot; is automatically a gamergater sounds like you know nothing of the subject.<br />
Hilariously enough, the first time i read it, I thought they censored the Oh-So-Evil-Nowadays word of being &quot;white&quot;. Should I be saying &quot;Looks like Tumblr is here&quot;? No.</div></div><hr />

Can't someone comment that apparently only skinny, white, blond haired girls in their early 20's play WoW? At least that's the impression Blizzard and all the officially affiliated fansites are perpetuating.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it would be so volatile in here if their marketing department didn't treat us like 15 year old boys.</div></div><hr />

Makes you wonder WHAT, exactly? Come on dude. Next time you have a thought like this, take a minute and just google the answer. Its nice that you came back to fill in the blank on who she is but i'm going to focus on your comment anyway because its far too representative of a bad attitude that a lot of people have about women in the gaming space.</div></div><hr />

Maybe the issue is that it takes two weeks for whoever to clear the raid....but back in Vanilla it took half a year to clear it (Molten Core 154days)!!! I say there is too much &quot;practice&quot; in PTR. What if it did take two months for raids to be cleared?</div></div><hr />

Is this like a &quot;takes one to know one&quot; scenario that you are familiar with or something? <br />
<br />
Quit moving the goal posts. She did a great job at Blizzcon last year, has a nice following on twitter, raids, and is a VO Artist in hearthstone but you think she just gets &quot;featured&quot; because she's blonde, like that's some rare, exotic quality that no one has ever seen before? Sorry she hasn't been around as long as you've been a troll.</div></div><hr />

Being a hot girl is somewhat of a double sided coin. As long as you are hot you dont have to make much of an effort in anything...you will always get things for free one way or another, however, if you truly are more then &quot;hot&quot; ppl would normally don't recognize you for that. Its just the way life is. But given the choice..I think most girls would choose the &quot;to be hot&quot; option...in stead of &quot;be smart&quot; option;)...yes you can be both smart and hot, but you will NOT be fully and truly recognized for both qualities;)</div></div><hr />

All the way up to Ulduar(that's the last zone I remember with a boss that was flat out broken and unkillable at release) they pretty regularly released bosses that could not be killed.<br />
<br />
What boss was unkillable? I think you talk about Mimiron, he was insane on hardmode (Didn't you see the sign that said 'DO NOT PUSH THIS BUTTON!'?) but we killed him on 10 and 25 before the big nerf. After the nerf he was a laugh seriously... all other hardmodes were easy. I wish there were more bosses like Mimiron pre-nerf. It was a real challenge. Everything had to work hand in hand and you needed skilled people<br />
<br />
The boss was not broken, we and other players killed him. You can say it's too hard for you but that's why it's called &quot;hardmode&quot;. It's always sad to see that Blizzard nerfs things, because people cry it's broken, when they only lack of skill.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jasper Kazai</div><div class="date">2015-08-19, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ragnaros unbeaten for 154 days. That's epic!

It would be nice to have content that lasted for that long again even for the top guilds.<br />
A large part of KT lasting so long was that he was bugged, though. It would be nice to have raids last more than a week (or two like HFC did for the first time in quite some time), but I don't think we'll ever see that with regularity again. The top tier endgame raiding scene is all about taking a week off to do nothing but raid, but they can't keep that up for too long. And the top tier race affects an incredibly small percentage of the playerbase, so the speed in which they clear a raid does not affect anyone else. Having that last too long would actually probably start to make people bored of the race, which is another downside. I'm sure Blizzard wouldn't want to lose that small amount of attention/press they get that comes with the raid clear race.<br />
<br />
I thought it was incredibly interesting that all BC raids except for BT and Sunwell were apparently in the game at launch. I started playing during BC, so I had very little notion of its endgame until the last quarter of the expansion. That's a model they certainly have never went back to. It would be an interesting thing to see again.</div></div><hr />
