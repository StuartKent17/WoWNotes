No, it is not good. It is supremely sub-par writing. Anyone over the age of 14 should be able to recognize this fact.<br />

To be fair, Blizzard aren't exactly starved for cash. If they wanted better writers they could easily afford better writers. Though I do think Christie Golden gets too much hate thrown her way. It's not like Blizzard's own writing is amazing - even a lot of the good stuff is changed on a whim because the developers feel like shoehorning something new into the story even when it's at the cost of stuff that was established in the past.</div></div><hr />

I grew up reading books or attempting to read them since I was a baby apparently. I've read so many works of fiction, non-fiction, and science-fiction along with fantasy that by now I have a generally good grasp of what kind of writing I find compelling or good. Golden is an atrocious writer when compared to even some somewhat obscure fantasy writers and the only reason I try to stomach through her books is purely to see the direction Blizzard wants the lore to take.<br />
<br />
Taste is subjective and other people might find her good or even average and that's fine. I however think she's a god-awful writer.</div></div><hr />

Then what would you classify as good writing/writing better than Golden's? Give me some names.<br />

To be fair, Blizzard aren't exactly starved for cash. If they wanted better writers they could easily afford better writers. Though I do think Christie Golden gets too much hate thrown her way. It's not like Blizzard's own writing is amazing - even a lot of the good stuff is changed on a whim because the developers feel like shoehorning something new into the story even when it's at the cost of stuff that was established in the past.<br />
<br />
It's not that they need 'good' writers so much as it is they need ones who are dedicated to the lore and world. Even a writer who isn't as honed at voice and storytelling is more valuable to Blizzard if they're good at writing stories set in the universe of WoW versus a really great writer with perfect prose who is disconnected from the world and only writes on a money-driven commission style.<br />

I grew up reading books or attempting to read them since I was a baby apparently. I've read so many works of fiction, non-fiction, and science-fiction along with fantasy that by now I have a generally good grasp of what kind of writing I find compelling or good. Golden is an atrocious writer when compared to even some somewhat obscure fantasy writers and the only reason I try to stomach through her books is purely to see the direction Blizzard wants the lore to take.<br />
<br />
Taste is subjective and other people might find her good or even average and that's fine. I however think she's a god-awful writer.<br />
<br />
I've read hundreds of books, a lot of them fantasy novels. Of all the writers who've worked for Blizzard, Christie easily the most polished and marketable voice. If you like other authors of any general caliber like, say, George R. R. Martin or J. K. Rowling or Eoin Colfer or Tom Clancy or pretty much any other really big fiction name then I'm at a loss for why Golden is suddenly so bad you can't stand her.<br />
<br />
She's written some pretty bad stuff, I'm not denying that, but generally she's pretty decent. The Jaina arc from War Crimes was terrible (like REALLY terrible) as was the disjointed and bizarre ending. The Arthas novel in general, hinging so heavily on romance, was a tough and poorly written read and her whole Turalyon/Alleria business throughout the two or three books they were in was heavily sappy and fanfictiony levels of camp, but again most of that is all her romance writing. Which is truly not good.</div></div><hr />

She's a decent writer. Her romance writing is, well, bad, but the rest of her writing is generally pretty good. Not much of a reason to say UGH GOLDEN WRITING KILL ME NOW MORE BAD WRITING. I'd like to see what sort of stuff people with that opinion read if Golden's hyper-standard voice is &quot;so bad&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
My opinion is that you should read more. Broaden your horizons. You'll see why Golden is considered subpar.<br />
Blizzard can afford a better writer. It's just that she's a regular by now. And they had much worse writers, so that makes her ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baseless assumption, kiddo. I've probably read more books than you, I'd imagine. Of fiction I've easily read in the few hundreds, consuming most of the notable fiction authors of the last 20 years or so. I no longer read much in the way of novels, having switched to primarily only non-fiction as of the last few years, but I've got a pretty damn good grasp on fiction. Golden has a very standard voice. She uses a lot of modifiers and adjectives, something I realize is considered taboo by lots of stuffy writers/writing critics but I don't really mind. She tells a good story and can work well with character motives/arcs.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
As I explained before it's much more an issue of needing a dedicated writer than a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;better&quot; one. Blizzard needs a writer who can immerse themselves into the world and create stories as a fan with passion, not a soulless commissionaire who generates product for money.</div></div><hr />

In reality there is only one really really bad WoW writer and that’s Keith R. A. DeCandido. The man who hadn’t a clue about the characters he wrote about. The man who made everyone a southern hillbilly. The man who made all the men hate women. If you think Golden is bad go read his book. <br />

so would you rather an &quot;ok&quot; writer? or a new writer that may or may not be better that will constantly get the lore wrong for years on end until they do a complete look over all the lore in the universe<br />

No matter your argument, I don't feel that she's a great writer and I'm entitled to my own opinion.<br />
<br />
That's fine, but again I'd like to know what you consider a good author and why if you think Golden is bad. I'm not the type to necessarily fanboy over her or anything, I just consider her fairly standard and often times (like, 100% of the time) people bitch relentlessly about her and how she's bad yet can never seem to adequately explain that opinion or justify it, especially when asked to name other authors.<br />
<br />
Your reasoning for her being a bad writer is, seemingly, just because she doesn't have her own fantasy canon (how do you know she's incapable of making her own stuff up by the way, lol? Just because she primarily writes other people's canons? Yeah, okay buddy.), which isn't a very good (read: totally invalid) reason to degrade her as a writer.<br />

I'd argue that honestly, Knaak isn't that great of an author either. He's not what I'd consider unreadably bad in general, but he has put out some unreadably bad books. Stormrage was, wow. Honestly almost as bad as Cycles of Hatred.<br />
<br />
But yes, Keith wrote the defacto worst Warcraft book. Cycles of Hatred was bad in just about every single way. The guy didn't even properly understand how to write dialogue.</div></div><hr />

Right now it's just looking like another Warchief turned evil story. We really need to stop having Warchieves, it's just not working out guys.<br />
<br />
I mean, I can understand Sylvanis's and Nathanos's resentment of Stormwind; which is born of a the fact that when the Forsaken were first looking for allies they sent emissaries to Stormwind first in the belief that Lordaeron should stand with the Alliance even in death. The Horde was their desperation move after they had been turned down. Add in 10+ years of resentment, cooked in with the whole Forsaken continuance thing that's been driving most of her actions since Wrath and the motivation seems sound, just not something that other people (myself included) can really sympathize with.<br />
<br />
I'm still pondering Vol'jin's vision. Right now Sylvanis hasn't done anything as Warchief that any other worthy candidate couldn't have done. The fact that the Horde and Alliance are patting themselves on the back for the Legion's defeat is equally ridiculous on both sides, as it was the practically all of the Neutral Factions that did most of the heavy lifting in the later part of the war while the Alliance and Horde fought each other for towers. I think Vol'jin appointing Sylvanis as Warchief was explicitly to get her out of the shadows so that her actions and motivations could be observed by the rest of the Horde. While that strongly echoes Garrosh at this point, and I would hate to see a repeat, I don't see this story going any other way.<br />
<br />
Hopefully the rest of the book proves me wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Golden is competent. That is my opinion. She is not grandiose or anything, but she is competent at what she does.<br />
However, the issue here is that competence alone is not good enough for people. There are definitely better authors out there and there are better books. And once people read those - and continue mostly reading books of those better authors - that becomes their new standard, meaning everything else becomes sub-par. They also tend to not realize the differences between this book and most fantasy novels. In most of those, authors have a lot of freedom regarding characters and oftentimes even the world they work in. Original fantasy works have much less editorial mandates than those set in established universes. And even extended universe novels can often at least focus on original characters. Golden though, she is working with established characters and has to at least somewhat coordinate that with other writers. The books have to reflect and inform ingame writing, which is no easy task and can be quite restrictive for a writer. Golden seems to have a lot of direction, especially when it comes to political events and outcomes. Her character development seems to often be ignored, too, like with Jaina. That kind of stuff can bog even the best writers down and turn books into messes.<br />
<br />
Plus, she is usually on a fairly tight schedule and can't just take all the time in the world to finish her book. Ain't that right, Mr Martin?</div></div><hr />

She's not at all superior to Knaak, he has put out some really enjoyable stuff like Day of the Dragon or the War of the Ancients trilogy. They both have some good and bad works but I mainly blame the state of Warcraft's lore at the time of the novel's writing.</div></div><hr />

For the price they're charging, I expect more than &quot;competent&quot;. I'll stop there, because I'll admit up front I'm a long time sci fi/fantasy bookworm, and I don't take the WoW books seriously, they're semi-pro fan fiction, and I don't have time for that - there are too many good books to spend my time and money on. The books to me have always been a missed opportunity, but whatever. <br />
<br />
And using George as an example is funny - he's a massive outlier to how normal authors work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormykitten</div><div class="date">2018-05-17, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda funny to see people's responses to the factions. I see some that say Horde looks like the bad guys again (though they seldom really are, more an individual) but that's AWESOME, as an Alliance player I am incredibly tired of the whole &quot;tiihii we defend and we are heroes&quot; vibe the faction is 100% locked into. So it really depends on what you want. Horde has way more free writing - just look at the post-Argus cinematics where one side gets a boring heroic speech and the other gets an interesting dinner scene; however, some probably find the reverse interesting if they actually want a heroic faction or whatever.<br />
<br />
So it's an interesting dynamic within the player on top of the underlying faction dynamics, I think. You have the people that want red v blue, or just many colours at once. Anyway, i think there is some cause for Alliance members to rethink the alliance if this expansion proceeds as hinted. Looking at the Night elves mainly. I don't think it will happen for game mechanics but still. Also, I admit i am still looking for a reason why Anduin is high king - the Alliance is not a monarchy.</div></div><hr />

As a nightelf I've already been rethinking all the way since I heard Teldrassil is gonna burn.<br />

Not that I have any idea of what you are actually refering to, but I am gonna assume it has something to do with my concerns, since I'm a nightelf fed up with my faction atm.</div></div><hr />

I find most fantasy to be on this level. I find Christie's writing to be representative of most fantasy being published commercially these days. Is any contemporary fantasy comparable to real literature? Sci fi is genre, but I find much better writing present in sci fi novels. Even GRRM's prose is pretty woeful. His worldbuilding makes up for it, and the suspense of waiting 84 years between novels, but his &quot;she brushed her hair 3990 times until it shone&quot; level of prose is cringeworthy.</div></div><hr />

She is an employee of Blizzard. So this novel is the idea of Blizzards story designers. They tell her what the outlines are, which characters are important and what should happen. She surely has some own ideas how to deal with that, but in the end she does not decide who dies, who lives, etc.<br />
That's what really bothers me. The story seems to be completely &quot;good vs evil&quot; and the Horde again may lose a warchief.</div></div><hr />

Okay. I don't get why they're still trying to push the plot of Sylvanas betraying Varian. She's doing plenty of bad stuff in BfA from what we've seen so far, no need to blame her for the one thing she's not actually guilty of.<br />
<br />
Edit: Unless they're gonna write it so Shaw willfully hid that information, ofcourse.</div></div><hr />

It's funny that you bring this up because I think it is a good point. Even Tolkien has examples of what you pointed out from Martin. Fellowship of the Ring was guilty of that kind of stuff, too.</div></div><hr />

For me was quite the opposite feeling, in any case I think they're building hype for a second movie, I'm pretty sure Weta Workshop has all the molds and patterns to re-create and improve those armors and props, Legendary and the production team can auction away and build hype with that.</div></div><hr />
