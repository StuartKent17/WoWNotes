They need to get their site ready to be able to upgrade it when it's released, they also need to have a pre-order. They could likely hide all this, but it would take extra work and this isn't showing up on normal accounts so why would they spend dev time hiding it on their ptr?</div></div><hr />

Let's hope it is cheaper. I don't know if I'll get the digital version (if it's the CE), but I'd like there to be an option anyway.</div></div><hr />

Whenever WoW eventually dies off, would rather have some stuff to remember it by.<br />

Personally I think that if they do digital deluxe it will just have pet and mount for wow.<br />
The other stuff should remain for physical collector's edition.<br />
Also I think for diablo it will have those data mined dark shadowy wings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you mean sell out? A month after Launch there were loads of Cataclysm CE's in the wild, half the price of the launch price :P<br />
<br />
Hell, you can still buy them now 2 years after launch.<br />
<br />
Diablo 3 however had some shortages, probably because it was more people actually buying it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's new. I think they want to let more people have the pet/mount than just the physical CE holders.<br />

You have to access the account screen a certain way. There isn't anything exciting there, the links aren't working to actually upgrade.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, they started testing the heroic raid boss versions only just last week. Same for pet battles. Other than those two big items, the beta is actually running quite smooth for the most part.<br />

There's just something about having all the extra goodies that makes it more worthwhile. I can wait a few days if it doesn't land on my doorstep on release day (I had to last year because Amazon UK used HDNL for delivery. Anyone who knows who HDNL are will know my pain... It turned up Christmas Eve by which time I had bought a copy from a local Game store!)<br />

<br />
So they are selling the same thing, just charging more for it, eh?<br />
<br />
It will be aimed at people who collect pets/mounts but either aren't interested in the box or don't want to wait for the box to be delivered.<br />
It's all about convenience in this day and age :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">subanark</div><div class="date">2012-07-23, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming that this will be the same as the CD edition as far as the bonus in game pet/mount... since they give it a different name, it will probably be cheaper than the full CE edition (and not limited supplies). I wonder if they will make or lose money on this, since they will get more sales from people that only want digital copies and those willing to spend some, but not a lot more. However, they will lose out on those that will buy this instead of the CE edition. <br />
<br />
For those that get the CE edition later than game start, Blizz should credit 4 months of game time if you buy the digital copy and later attach a CE edition, similar to the anual pass and D3 CE edition.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping that they keep to CE edition being purely vanity bonuses, unlike Rift $10 upgrade to CE edition for a bigger starting bag (and a mount useable at any level).</div></div><hr />

Now, if only we knew what was in the DDE... Mount? Pet? Both? Neither?<br />
<br />
<br />
It will defintely have both the pet and the mount, what other purp0se would there be for a deluxe edition? The question is on the soundtrack and digital version of the book. The last question will be it´s pricing. Gotta figure $15 to $20 more than the normal digital download, but will it be significantly less than the Box CE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unlimited CD keys for a DDE, without having to produce physical media (Game DVD, silly books, music CDs)... Blizz will make decent $ on this. Low production price with a potential price tag of... lets say 60 bucks. if even 1/10 of all MOP sales are Digital Deluxe, that's 60 million in revenue.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm looking forward to the announcement of the pre-orders (and the subsequent request for a refund from GameStop) and I will be getting the Digital Deluxe Edition if it contains both pet and mount. If not, I'll scrounge up some more and upgrade to the full CE from GameStop if I can.<br />
<br />
As I said before, the profit potential of Digital Deluxe Edition keys for Vanilla through Cataclysm is incredible... a Digital Deluxe Bundle that contains keys to upgrade your licenses to Vanilla/BC/WOTLK/Cataclysm DDE (for the pets) for 60 bucks, or 20 bucks per expansion</div></div><hr />

However, they will lose out on those that will buy this instead of the CE edition. Even if it's $10-20 cheaper, they don't have to let Target/Walmart/etc take a cut of the revenue, so it's actually not less money for blizzard, it's more, (not to mention the savings in box/shipping/etc).</div></div><hr />

You have to remember that what you see on beta right now is 4 or 5 builds behind what they are working on. Most of those bugs are fixed - just not put ingame yet. And, even with the extensive beta testing this time, other bugs will show up when it launches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it could be that they are doing the same as ArenaNet are doing with pre ordering GW2 there are 3 versions there too. There is basic game digital, basic game digital and some added in game goodies. And then the physical boxed version with basic game, in game goodies and then the books, figures and soundtrack CD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish. Granted, I live in the middle of nowhere, but the Walmart here still has 2 copies and they are *still* $89.99. I want it just to go with my other ones and I was unemployed at release so I just bought the regular edition. But I'm not paying that kind of money for all the extras when I already own the game. (Yeah, I'm cheap.)<br />
<br />
If this Digital Edition has worthwhile extras and is significantly cheaper than the physical CE, I might consider buying it, but I do have $40 in Amazon gift cards so I will probably end up with the physical CE. And I love how they look displayed on a bookshelf anyway.</div></div><hr />

They wouldn't do that, too many people who get the collector's editions would feel like they have to buy both. If anything, it'll just be the pet and mount and *possibly* soundtrack. But my money is the Digital Deluxe edition will just those two things.</div></div><hr />

if the digital deluxe edition has ANYTHING different from the physical collector's edition i will be royally pissed. i'm buying the physical CE because i want the bookshelf swag, and if i get cheated out of something in game... well i already said.<br />
<br />
i assume game stop is a us company and if so im sorry im from the uk if i preorder anything at game or gamestation (the uk's 2 biggest game retairs) and i cancel my pre order i lose my deposit<br />
<br />
the amount i paid for the pre order is then subtracted off the cost of the game at release as long as i have the receipt</div></div><hr />

Your point may be right.<br />
But I've payed the AP and I don't see any image in my account ingame or b.net account.<br />
<br />
Still waiting for more information about this.</div></div><hr />

yeah riiiight. I am an annual pass holder and while i'd be kind of happy if this were the case, there's no way on earth blizzard would do this, imagine the QQ from everyone who didnt buy annual pass, theyd be all 'this wasn't on the list of what i'd get if i signed up' etc.<br />
<br />
it makes perfect sense that digital deluxe is what everyone has speculated; collectors edition without the physical stuff.</div></div><hr />

I don't see the button on the right right for the deluxe upgrade..<br />
<br />
this is also the case for my MOP beta account.. and yes I live in the US and have annual pass with no account interruptions in over 5 years.. my guess is Blizzard is still working on the site and it won't be official for a while..</div></div><hr />

Im guessing they are uploading now the item or soon to be released image of the CE box.<br />

And now i can see the option to upgrade to the normal or deluxe digital option on my blizzard account (US)<br />
