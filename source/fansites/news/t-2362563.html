Pretty difficult to make a dungeon group already where someone doesn't have some type of aoe slow as it is. That racial will probably be quite irrelevant as far as the snare goes</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly the point. You might not like it, but that's purely down to a stylistic choice. The execution of that style is fine, I've not seen any reasonable criticism to suggest otherwise. By no reasonable artistic analysis is it 'high-school quality'.</div></div><hr />

Raptor Strike (New) Raptor Strike deals 40% increased damage. Hunter - Survival Spec.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thats something I don't get lol I rly rly like the survival spec, just tried bm and was bursting out in laughter.. anyway, will survival get a nerf? or is it a buff?<br />
<br />
The green and red text is the wrong way around. It's a buff. And a big buff for BM...</div></div><hr />

That's exactly the point. You might not like it, but that's purely down to a stylistic choice. The execution of that style is fine, I've not seen any reasonable criticism to suggest otherwise. By no reasonable artistic analysis is it 'high-school quality'.<br />
<br />
The dwarf looks like some type of humanoid furry with braids(I literally thought it is a vulpera or something and had to pause for a second and think about what the hell is depicted). The worgen doesn't represent the worgen model at all and looks like a human dressed as a werewolf for Halloween. I've got no idea what the last two Alliance soldiers are and which race they belong to, but I can only guess it is a human and a draenei or two humans.<br />

You're right, being a bit dickish towards you - so my bad.<br />
<br />
I guess my only problem with the picture is how the soldiers are portrayed. It makes it seems like a fun race between the two groups, when they are about to start murdering each other in a few seconds. Not sure I understand the comedic angle the artist was going for, is all.</div></div><hr />

Blizz seems to swing between grim-dark horror elements (Argus, Karazhan Crypts, Ur'zul, etc) and upbeat positive vibes, probably to cater to a bigger market<br />
<br />
Does it fit the overarching theme? Nah, and the characters in it could definitely be more detailed but seems they were going for a &quot;minimalist&quot; approach like the WoD garrison loading screens (Horde one anyway)</div></div><hr />

No its not, your reading this wrong, our damage is the same, they nerfed the basic for levels 1 - 110, and then buffed the other so its the same, cut the base with 100% and buff talent cobra shot by 100%, so its the same in the end for us.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. Relative to the other loading screens, like this one below (which looks so awesome), it just doesn’t fit the style nor the normal level of detail. Too bad they probably won’t change it. :/<br />

This isn't even cartoony. Half the depictions don't make sense. I don't mind a cartoony appearance, because that is what appeals the most to me in WoW, but it should be a well-drawn cartoony interpretation of how things are.<br />

You might be right that it is subjective but I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who had a hard time telling it was a dwarf. Scroll back, read some posts and you'll see that many had the same problem.</div></div><hr />

The only comments I see are people saying it does not have enough detail or is to cartoonish. For WoW... this game has Jack Black pandas and the most anime style raid fights I've ever seen outside of final fantasy. There are very few styles that do not fit this game.

Sure. But I'm not ready to give up the Blood Elf crit bonus AND the silence. Losing damage and utility is too much. I'd be fine with losing one of the two. But if Blizzard doesn't want my race change money they can keep the racials like that.</div></div><hr />

Sure. But I'm not ready to give up the Blood Elf crit bonus AND the silence. Losing damage and utility is too much. I'd be fine with losing one of the two. But if Blizzard doesn't want my race change money they can keep the racials like that.<br />
<br />
Make an alt then. If you really wanna play Nightborne but racials are a big deal then just do an alt. I've got loads of the same class as different races. Got 4 Hunters. Night Elf, Draenei, Troll and Tauren. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2018-01-05, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only comments I see are people saying it does not have enough detail or is to cartoonish. For WoW... this game has Jack Black pandas and the most anime style raid fights I've ever seen outside of final fantasy. There are very few styles that do not fit this game. But tell me why YOU don't like it.<br />
The pandaren concept predates Kung Fu Panda by several years, FYI.<br />
<br />
But here's my reasoning:<br />
<br />
1) The contrast is a bit too bright and gives off a more &quot;cheery&quot; vibe which doesn't mesh with the premise of the fighting.<br />
<br />
2) Lack of detail. For example, the Alliance... thing... is a poorly drawn dwarf. You want to know what my initial thought was? &quot;It looks like a pig in armor.&quot; The other faction characters don't fare much better themselves, either.<br />
<br />
3) For having weapons and shields on them, the scene looks rather comedic.<br />
<br />
4) The entire style itself looks like something out of Hearthstone rather than World of Warcraft. This is probably because it was drawn by a Hearthstone artist, one who seems to not have done their research properly.<br />
<br />
5) I'm probably forgetting something else, but I can't recall what it was. u_u<br />

So I have a token for a 100 boost - Can I use it on an Allied race or do I have to use before Battle for Azeroth comes out?<br />
I think you can, but boosting an Allied Race locks you out of being able to obtain the heritage armor with that character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you use it on a allied race then you won't be getting the transmog for it, only if you level it up from 20, and for the level boost, you can use it when ever you like, wait 2 expansions if you want :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What Level/Where do They Start At?<br />
Allied Races begin their journey at level 20. The current plan is for them to start in the main hub of their respective faction (Orgrimmar and Stormwind) and level wherever they see fit within the new old world scaling technology.<br />
<br />
Level Boost/Race Change<br />
You are able to level boost and race change to an Allied Race once it is unlocked on your account.<br />
<br />
Heritage Armor<br />
After you unlock an Allied Race, leveling one to level cap will unlock a race restricted armor transmog unique to that race. This must be done by actually leveling and not through level boosting or race changing. These transmogs are armor agnostic, meaning they can be transmogged on any type of armor.</div></div><hr />

It just looks like environment concept art for the new BG. A lot of dungeon / etc. loading screens are just environment concept art.</div></div><hr />

I'm crossing my fingers so hard these races are available before expansion drop.</div></div><hr />

It sounds kinda arabesque, probably to fit the &quot;mystic arab night&quot; that ethereals have.</div></div><hr />
