Quests Datamining - Quel'Delar<br />
There is a lot of speculation going on a few sites based on the Quel'Delar quest chain datamined a few days ago and available on the Database (http://db.mmo-champion.com/). I figured I should add a few information here. <br />
<br />
First, do not expect a new player legendary item, this is most likely a storyline quest chain to ultimately give back the powerful sword to one of your faction leaders. The chain is as follow :<br />
<br />
The Battered Hilt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14443/the-battered-hilt/) - Bring the Battered Hilt to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's rest.<br />
What The Dragons Know (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14444/what-the-dragons-know/) - Speak to Krasus at the top of Wyrmrest Temple, then report your findings to Arcanist Tybalin in the Silver Enclave in Dalaran.<br />
The Sunreaver Plan (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14457/the-sunreaver-plan/) - Bring the Sunreaver Orders to Arcanist Tybalin at the Silver Enclave in Dalaran.<br />
A Suitable Disguise (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/20438/a-suitable-disguise/) - Obtain a Borrowed Tabard from Shandy Sparkleshine and bring it to Arcanist Tybalin at the Silver Enclave in Dalaran.<br />
A Meeting With The Magister (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/20439/a-meeting-with-the-magister/) - Retrieve the Ancient Dragonforged Blades tome for Arcanist Tybalin in Dalaran's Silver Enclave.<br />
Return to Caladis Brightspear (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24454/return-to-caladis-brightspear/) - Bring Ancient Dragonforged Blades to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's Rest.<br />
Re-Forging The Sword (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24461/re-forging-the-sword/) (Provided: Remnants of Quel'Delar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49740/remnants-of-quel-delar/)) - Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's Rest wants you to obtain 5 Infused Saronite Bars and use the Forgemaster's Hammer to combine them with the Battered Hilt to create the Re-forged Quel'Delar.<br />
Tempering the Blade (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24476/tempering-the-blade/) (Provided: Reforged Quel'Delar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49739/re-forged-quel-delar/)) - <br />
The Halls of Reflection (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24480/the-halls-of-reflection/) - Bring your Tempered Quel'Delar to Sword's Rest inside the Halls of Reflection. Return to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's rest after you have completed your journey.<br />
Journey to the Sunwell (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24522/journey-to-the-sunwell/) - Speak with Halduron Brightwing at the entrance to the Sunwell Plateau on the Isle of Quel'Danas.<br />
Thalorien Dawnseeker (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24535/thalorien-dawnseeker/) - Visit Thalorienn Dawnseeker's Remains and obtain his blessing to wield Quel'Delar, then return to Halduron Brightwing near the entrance to the Sunwell.<br />
There is also The Purification of Quel'Delar (Vereesa) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24553/the-purification-of-quel-delar/) / The Purification of Quel'Delar (Aethas) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24594/the-purification-of-quel-delar/) / The Purification of Quel'Delar (Mariel) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24595/the-purification-of-quel-delar/) but for some reasons this quest isn't included in the chain started by The Battered Hilt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14443/the-battered-hilt/).<br />
<br />
The Argent Crusade version of the description of The Purification of Quel'Delar (Mariel) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24595/the-purification-of-quel-delar/) suggests that you will ultimately give the weapon to a NPC. &quot;It may be best to entrust the weapon to the Argent Crusade, where it will serve as a symbol to unite the Lich King's enemies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now if you want some real speculation from quests datamining, I suggest that you keep these links bookmarked and check them after each PTR build to see if they are updated :<br />
<br />
The Splintered Throne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24548/the-splintered-throne/) - Probably related to the Frozen Throne ... and Arthas?<br />
Shadowmourne, Blade of Legends (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24549/shadowmourne-blade-of-legends/) - Legendary weapon.<br />
Icecrown Citadel Quests on the DB (http://db.mmo-champion.com/quests/?zone=4812)<br />
<br />
One of the quest in the Icecrown Citadel is already available - The Sacred and the Corrupt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24545/the-sacred-and-the-corrupt/)<br />
<br />
Objective<br />
Place Light's Vengeance and Runeforged Saronite in Highlord Mograine's runeforge in Icecrown Citadel.<br />
<br />
Description<br />
It is against my judgment that I present you this errand, &lt;race&gt;, as it will likely end in your undoing.<br />
<br />
Ignore my counsel and embark on this endeavor, and I shall provide you with the necessary knowledge and resources to see it through. Its success shall depend on your fortitude being greater than that endowed to most mortals.<br />
<br />
Recover Light's Vengeance, Arthas' discarded hammer. Combined with saronite, it will provide the foundation for our work. <br />
<br />

Pet resilience<br />
We certainly don't think pet resilience is useless. We are considering increasing it to 100% of master's resilience to make up for the increased AE damage pets will take in PvP. We don't want pets to explode on contact (neither do we want pet classes to be twice as difficult to kill) but we did think it was a little goofy and unintuitive that pets could just shrug off AE attacks in PvP. We'd rather make pets tougher against all types of damage than be vulnerable to some and nearly immune to others. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20122738970-ok-pet-resilience.html))<br />

The Infernal and Doomguard have the 90% creature avoidance that other pets do in patch 3.3. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20122738547-please-fix-infernal-and-doomguard.html))<br />

<br />
and to pets:<br />
<br />
In first place adds were given avoidance for both pve &amp; pvp. then they removed it and now they think they could fix it by giving them more res?<br />
I play a hunter and my problem is not the missing 40% or what res... my problem is my pets health. whirlewinded and bladestormed within a few seconds...<br />
<br />
A further reason to choose a 'tank' pet rather than a 'pvp' pet family. oww boy mr crabs... get ready for bladestorm.</div></div><hr />

the looping was made either by a command and then via mouse or by pushing paste and del on your keyboard (got a german qwertz one so i don't know if i translated right and if its the same on a qwerty - please correct me if im wrong)<br />

Maybe you:<br />
Use it in combat against him (like KT)<br />
Or you'll find in the last phase the armour side by side with a 'naked' Arthas Hammer in his hand.<br />

Afair you can find it in the frostmourne cave. Arthas left it there and never returned. (or perhaps someone actually took it right before 3.3 )</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll share mine :<br />
It looks like there could be 3 Endings with this Quest Chain ... 2 of those say that the sword &quot;will bond itself to you&quot; one lets you pass the sword to the Argent Crusade...<br />
<br />
I think that the sword may be developed into 3 directions<br />
either a caster blade, a melee or tank blade or (for those classes that can't use swords) a quest item that can be turned in for some other rewards.</div></div><hr />

?<br />
<br />
Nope, you use that when on the ground with any mount whilst not moving to make it do something special. The flip is done by a button on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
I just tested out the /mountspecial on the Hippogryph now that it can walk, its damn cool!</div></div><hr />

Are you SERIOUS? It was very obviously because they would have to completely make a new animation and didn't feel it was appropriate to allocate the resources towards that at the time. It looked very sloppy seeing hippos flap along the ground.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll share mine :<br />
It looks like there could be 3 Endings with this Quest Chain ... 2 of those say that the sword &quot;will bond itself to you&quot; one lets you pass the sword to the Argent Crusade...<br />
<br />
I think that the sword may be developed into 3 directions<br />
either a caster blade, a melee or tank blade or (for those classes that can't use swords) a quest item that can be turned in for some other rewards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's my 2c<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure I remember reading somewhere that the Quel'Delar is a class specific weapon; only certain classes will be able to wield the Quel'Delar, and not necessarily all classes with the ability to wield a 2H sword. I can't remember when or where the source was, most likely was on mmo-champion, but I believe it mentioned only some of the classes which have the ability to wield a 2H sword, not all, as being able to wield the Quel'Delar. I remeber this because I think I have an 80 that was not on the list of classes that can wield the Quel'Delar, but can wield a 2H sword, and 2 80's that could. I can't remember if it was my warrior or my dk who couldn't, but I have a horrible feeling that it was my warrior, which I play a lot more than my dk... =[ <br />
<br />
edit: with that being said, I think those 3 end quests are going to be: 1 for horde classes that can wield the Quel'Delar, 1 for alliance classes that can wield the Quel'Delar, and 1 for both factions for classes who cannot wield the Quel'Delar...<br />
any thoughts on that?</div></div><hr />

Regardless, the players do all the work, and for the player to do all the work into forging the sword then to give it to some nobody npc that will provide little to no support, is just plain stupid. Even Tirion is hardly putting Ashbringer to use. Besides almost 1 shotting the Lich King..<br />

If you want to complain about something, complain about the fact that a hippogryph shouldn't, by all rights, be able to hover at all, given it's size and wingspan! That goes for - Gryphons, Dragons, Wyverns, and anything bigger than a hoverbird.<br />
<br />
I certainly wouldn't be saying that giving the hippogryph a new animation is a nerf. I wouldn't be saying it killed the fun of the game, either. <br />

Because all those things are extra realistic amirite? If something isnt broken why fix it? (or as somepeople seem to have note, why break it?)<br />
I liked the old animations alot, it was one of the unique remaining things in hte game. In saying that im not going to petition to have it changed back or anything, just choose a different mount. Personally the only mount for me is druid flight form, but my rogue aint gunna get that now is he. out side of flightform/hippogriff i dont like the look of any of the flying mounts in hte game. just personal preference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a Night Elf, I feel compelled to ride my Cenarion Hippogryph at all times, because i'm a total RPer like that (give me a Chimera mount now damnit!) but I had to give that up because I just couldn't stand the run animation (or lack thereof). Now, the mount is complete, so I can ride it once more. Not to mention it just looks so sleek and badass when it runs now.<br />
<br />
And to to the person asking if the Hippogryph mobs will run now, I doubt it. After all, Gryphon mobs don't run in spite of the fact their mount counterparts do, so I don't expect Hippogryphs to be any different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, you missed my point. Which was... ahem... Some people will complain about anything. My example was merely to point out that there are better things to complain about if you're going to complain at all. (Hint about size and hovering - perhaps it is magic makes physics work differently for some flying creatures in the universe of Warcraft?)<br />
<br />
As for fixing something that wasn't broken... It wasn't a bug, no one implied that it was broken. An animation was merely overlooked, and has now been added to the game.<br />
<br />
I hardly think that the designers actually made a conscious decision to leave out the landing/walking/taking off animations of the hippogryph... Unless it had something to do with running out of time, and even then I'm sure they always intended to add the animation at some point in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
I liked the old animations alot, it was one of the unique remaining things in hte game. In saying that im not going to petition to have it changed back or anything, just choose a different mount.

<br />
<br />
There was nothing special about the old animation - it was merely the same animation as flying, only slower.<br />
<br />
As for the rest - can I have your hippogryph if you're not going to use it anymore? ;) (Just kidding! :D) I still haven't managed to work through the boring grind to get one... though I'm close to enough tokens for the the Argent one with my DK... but I still want the Cenarion one... *sigh* Something that may never happen, as I lack the patience.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but the fact that the Hippogryph didn't land was an obvious act of laziness on Blizz's part. 99% of people who care about the mount are a little bit happier that it can actually land now rather than perpetually stay afloat.(Why does a creature evolve to have legs if it doesn't use them btw?)<br />
I also think you under estimate how many people were disappointed after buying the Cenarian mount and finding it couldn't land. It was not terribly easy to get back in the day and was often immediately shelved due to the disapointment. I've seen many demands on the forums for the animation. It's inclusion should not be a huge suprise.<br />
<br />
Also... If you really don't want your mount to walk on the ground have you considered that it's still going to be totally within your power to simply. Not. Land!<br />
<br />
Come on people, of all teh changes Blizzard has ever made this has got to be one where everyone should be happy... ::)</div></div><hr />

Well the lack of walking and running animation for a creature that clearly has legs and feet just irritated me. (The lack of the same for druid flight form also irritates me - for the love of nature, go watch birds hopping around sometime, Blizz! How cool would it be for Stormcrows to hop around?) You are entitled to your opinion, though, I can't really begrudge you that. It's just that there are people out there who are really that bad... and having come across a lot of them since Cata was announced, I guess my patience is shot. :)</div></div><hr />

Captured -alive- slaves to mine Saronite, while he can raise an undead army ? Surely an army of undead slaves wouldn't be too much work.<br />

Arthas sure has gotten lazy. And chubby.</div></div><hr />

I liked the old animations alot, it was one of the unique remaining things in hte game. In saying that im not going to petition to have it changed back or anything, just choose a different mount. Personally the only mount for me is druid flight form, but my rogue aint gunna get that now is he. out side of flightform/hippogriff i dont like the look of any of the flying mounts in hte game. just personal preference.<br />

It was broken..... was simply blizzard being lazy fucks and not fixing something for 3 years.</div></div><hr />
