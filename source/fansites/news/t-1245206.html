Patch 5.2 LFR<br />
It looks like LFR will be broken into four different groupings this time. <br />
<br />
Last Stand of the Zandalari - The forces of the Zandalari forces have dug into the ruins surrounding the Thunder King's island citadel.<br />
Forgotten Depths - Beneath the foundations of the Throne of Thunder lie vast caverns, teeming with ancient horrors.<br />
Halls of Flesh-Shaping - In the horrific chambers beneath Lei Shen's citadel, the mogu conducted terrible experiments into reshaping life.<br />
Pinnacle of Storms - From within his inner sanctum, the risen Thunder King plots the return of the great mogu empire.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvE<br />
Any news on 25men raiding and incentives for them? Numbers of guilds still dwindling, you mentioned a developer blog<br />
We have an idea, but it's a bit controversial so we're not ready to spring it on you yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281091815015346177))<br />
<br />
Could you give me a reason as to why 25man raids don't just straight up drop items that already are already 2/2 upgraded?<br />
Because that would cause progression-oriented 10 player raids to feel like they had to switch to 25s to benefit from the ilevel. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281451667117993984))<br />
<br />
Why the Empress nerf? We were still working on it but felt it was 100% doable.<br />
Ten player raids were bringing 4 healers, which felt broken. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281090558544465920))<br />
<br />
So what about new players 5.3? What about alts? Coming back in the middle of MoP=impossible?<br />
There's a big continuum between instantly caught up and impossible. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280718882707222529))<br />
<br />
Is 10H Shek'zeer designed to be 4 healed?<br />
Not ideally. Discussing it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280718627311869952))<br />
<br />
Any reason why Flask Cauldrons didn't make an appearance in MoP ? <br />
We wanted to return some responsibility of raiding to individual members not just officers. <br />
This answer does not make sense. So you should remove feasts too... You are just adding work to the officers.<br />
This is a tiny, tiny step back towards that. It doesn't seem unreasonable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280716739875074049))<br />
Once upon a time, players spent a big chunk of time preparing for raiding, not just logging in (+ summoned) and then done. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280716639354368000))<br />
<br />
How &quot;bad&quot; would it for the game if LFR never dropped twice the same item (DW aside) ? Did you do that projection internally ?<br />
If players could gear up that much faster, then they'd finish the content (and demand something new) that much faster... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280485818387271681))<br />
<br />
LFR is the only way for me as a casual to get loot. After the 4th run with nodrops, i got so angry.. i destroyed my mouse<br />
You'll still get valor from those runs though and that gear is higher ilevel. I've raided for weeks many times with no drops. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281452702926516224))<br />
<br />
Expanding on recent LFR thread, could there be two options at queuing for loot? 'Queued spec' or 'any spec' would make sense.<br />
Yeah it needs something like that, but it needs to be clean, not a double role check. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280386797727518720))<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, most of what LFR healing consists of is meter padding.<br />
I wouldn't take LFR meters as a meaningful indication of anything. That's just not what LFR is about. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280386128555679744))<br />
<br />
A player is fighting vs Galleon. He changes to another group. The second group can loot. Is it ok for you?<br />
I know there were some mixed messages from us on this, but it's fine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281526153007751168))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Every gladiator/2400+ player I know feels that you balance poorly. Nerf &quot;a&quot; classleave starsurge at 250k = golden<br />
We have heard very little Starsurge QQ, even from highly rated players. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281455289675427840))<br />
<br />
Do healers in pvp have roles between classes, or should they be similar to each other?<br />
They should feel different, but generally you don't need enough of them for well-defined niches to be important. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281457601881985025))<br />
<br />
So, warriors back to the free-kills in PVP again.Surprise.Plz don't kill PVE viability when you do.<br />
Despite what forums would have you believe, there is a continuum between overpowered and free kill. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281525075495227393))<br />
<br />
How do you feel about the players getting to 90 just now and not being able to play arena competitively due to being behind<br />
We want to reward players who keep playing. Too often in the past catch up was so easy that it trivialized accomplishments. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280482725448777728))<br />
So, since Mt. Everest was climbed the first time, have we put up gates to stop people from going up there?<br />
We don't put chair lifts up there... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280723177666117632))<br />
Also, they havent pu lifts because of technical limitations, not because of climbers having their achieve screwed<br />
I'd argue mountain climbers like to climb things that are challenging, not things that anyone can stroll up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280725302739599362))<br />
But you brought this trivialization of content yourselves starting with patch 3.2 &gt;.&gt; … what have you learned since then?<br />
We learned not to let players catch up so trivially that it negates everyone else's accomplishments. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280721645272981505))<br />
Greg, you need to stop blaming the wrong things for cataclysm failures. Catch up mechanics dont hurt the game<br />
We just disagree on that. I understand you have very strong feelings about how things should work. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280725857054621696))<br />
<br />
why make us to do Rated BGs for cap?<br />
We know from history that players will do the most convenient thing to earn points without a strong incentive to do otherwise. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280724307129290753))<br />
<br />
In your opinion, whats a more fun pvp experience? A team objective based bg? or chasing a druid around a piller for 30+ mins?<br />
I personally prefer the former, but as I've said, I know not all our players like what I like. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280485611473874945))<br />
<br />
Upgrading PVP gear via Conq sure is rough for newcomers to arenas who want to catch up. It was already so hard to compete =\<br />
If newcomers can catch up too quickly, then the players who stuck with it start to wonder why they bothered. It's a fine line. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280715673729130496))<br />
Getting gear is 0% of PvP. In fact we hate that part. It's the competition. Please realize that.<br />
For tournaments, gear shouldn't matter. For playing your character, we want it to. It's a powerful incentive. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281096112805404673))<br />
WoW is an RPG. Getting gear is a big part of that. We don't think the game would have legs, even in PvP, without it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281096003317276672))<br />
<br />
heres one more, how about balance pvp around BG and RBG instead of 3v3 arena. BGs are were 90% of pvp takes place if not more<br />
I don't think that % is correct. Arenas, even very casual 2s, are very popular. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280040057564438528))<br />
yes that maybe true, but you balance pvp around 3v3, where the most pvp is not played<br />
PvP might not be played by you in 3's but it is the most competitive and balanced bracket even rbgs are a mess<br />
RBGs feel pretty good to us. What are your concerns? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280484663791874049))<br />
<br />
My point, is that Tanks have a purpose in arena, pvp has become who can lock down who first. Its not methodical.<br />
We're just not convinced that tanks in Arena would be very fun for everyone else. Tanks make great flag carriers in BGs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280483357916286976))<br />

Really hate that we get blue posts saying how dailies aren't mandatory (which means neither is rep grinding), yet their answer for not getting loot in LFR is it still awards Valor. Too bad Valor loot is all conveniently behind rep, ie. dailies. <br />

<br />
Such a broken system.<br />
<br />
Because rep is such a demanding system. Honestly, if you're casual you shouldn't be worried about &quot;OMGZ I NEED 489 GEARS RIGHT NAOW!!&quot; If you do one set of dailies (30-45 min) per day you can still gain rep fairly quickly on a casual schedule. Plus, with the commendations you can get rep for alts twice as fast . Just because the system requires you to do more than queue, AFK, AFK while hitting some buttons (LFR), then rinse and repeat does not make it broken.<br />
<br />
Edit: Not to mention that with VP caps it takes some time to gain valor and you might even be revered with a rep before you have the VP for the item. Reputations also allow you to become more involved in the lore of Pandaria than any of the expansions, imo. I never bothered to do dailies because they never had rewards that made it worth it to me and thusly I never got into the story of why those people are there, but with MoP there is a reason to do them and now I actually enjoy them because I realize just how amazing it is the actually play a role in the story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely you are not a casual player/raider (which i think it is his point). And being able to just do those raids (LFR), easy or not, afk or not, its the only way for some ppl to have fun in the game. <br />
There lays the unfortunate truth that the drop rate of items is indeed too low. That leads to you just have to focus on grinding dailies, it is boring enough on main character, now imagine doing it on multiple alts, at this point i feel that my alts have no point of being leveled, more dailies plus poor drop rate in LFR, pff. <br />
I do not agree with the amount of dailies implemented and definitely cant agree with the drop rate on lfr, as a person that has, and enjoy playing many toons that does not reach my goal and makes me lose interest in the game completely and just log to raid normal modes on my main, but hey, thats me.<br />
This said the man has a point and a valid one in my opinion, no QQ here, facts are facts.<br />

<br />
Year, it's more fun because you get the same loot for an easier raid. That's why there aren't so much 25 mens anymore. Not because they love 10s, no, they just get the same loot for just nothing. 25s need some incentives and you will see how all the guys would come back to 25s. <br />
<br />
No need to split ID's again, but give the 25s four itemlevels more and every player needs to decide if he wanna go freeloot 10s or 25s with a little bit better gear. This would make sense in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's just a lack of enough same skilled players and not an interest problem. Finding 25people of the same skill level who will be content with eachother is a very hard task to complete on 1 realm.<br />
Many people would like to return to bigger raids. Feels more epic and waaaaaaaaaaay better loot distribution. Organising 25m vs 10m isn't hard at all and higher hardware requirements is also easily solved.<br />
I'm of the opinion that 25m is allready way more attractive than 10m but due to skill disparity it's just harder to make a raid but that's not something Blizzard can fix by giving more rewards.<br />
<br />
It's Blizzard's fault because they make fights so hard basically. If the guy at the bottom of the dps wouldn't be blocking your raid from a new kill, nobody would care that he's bad.<br />
It's what vanilla raiding was. Fill up a raid with 40people who had required FR and go have fun together not caring if someone did 500dps or 600dps.</div></div><hr />

So do you want fight to be as simple as in vanilla,just so you can have ''fun'' in raids again? No thanks</div></div><hr />

If players could gear up that much faster, then they'd finish the content (and demand something new) that much faster... <br />
<br />
<br />
Wow.............. So doing LFR, not getting loot, getting frustrated with the game counts as content now? Nice.<br />
<br />
Doing LFR is one approach of doing raid content. Getting frustrated is just the side-effect of bad RNG luck, which Blizzard can't really control without trivializing the content for those whose only means of doing that raid is through LFR.<br />
<br />
That's what GC is trying to say there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Year, it's more fun because you get the same loot for an easier raid.<br />
<br />
For each &quot;Oh that makes it easy&quot; thing that a person who's never done 10-man raiding is eager to point out, they ignore 2 massive drawbacks that 25-man raiding has as an advantage over 10's.</div></div><hr />

Well yes obviously it's easier to find 10 then it is to find 25. Still it was possible before, when people had to do 25 if they wanted the better loot. <br />
So i'm still convinced that interest is a big part of the equation. Given the same outcome (loot wise), it seems most people prefer doing 10 man over 25.</div></div><hr />

Very true, it all comes down to the path of least resistance. In general (although there are always exceptions), as a species we are lazy and will do the minimum to achieve our goals. In this case, with equal rewards, it seems that 10 man raiding is the &quot;easier&quot; option.<br />
<br />
Take that as you will.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't talking about just finding people, talking about people of the same skill. The main annoyance in progress, even worse than RNG loot, is other raid members who are slacking. There are more hardcore gamers quiting WoW than there are joining which is what makes it harder each xpack to find people.<br />
My statement is if all players in a raid would have the same skill, everyone (with a good enough pc) would pick 25m for better character progression. Not only for the extra drop 25m has from each boss but the extra loot helps greatly on the big loot tables.<br />
Lei shi is a good example with sha-touched ranged/staff/dagger. In 10m you get 1 token drop and then 1 extra drop from 17 items. That's only 6% chance to see those weapons drop in 10m. While you possibly have to share with more people in 25m, you at least have a far greater chance of seeing more of the loot table drop and distribute to those you want.<br />
<br />
If we're talking about casual raiding then 10m is indeed probably what most people really prefer. Small group of friends having some fun.<br />
<br />
But if 25m will get even more advantage then they allready have, then many of 10m will feel pushed enough to try switching to 25m. It's easy to predict what horrible things will happen in the community if this is done. Many guilds falling apart, overabundance of tanks and raids filled with dps with huge performance difference making fights even harder.<br />
I suspect people complaining about 25m are those that don't like the format and for some reason keep doing it. Their only solution is play how they like and go 10m if that's what they prefer. If they only complain because their own guild is having problems finding enough people for their team, then they should start imagining how much worse it would become in WoW anno 2012 if all raiding guilds switched back to 25m.</div></div><hr />

We've been down this road before (Wrath). It's really unfair to guilds and servers with small populations/members. I'm on a larger server and I've tried to get 25 mans going multiple times. We've had good progression nights then suddenly 2-3 people can't make it. Something comes up, it's impossible to keep a stable of raiders and rotate people weekly and not risk losing someone else. We all know there are plenty of raiders that only care about themselves and only raid for loot, not the challenge. Higher ilevel in 25s would just cause an influx of those types of people. <br />
<br />
I personally thing a good solution would be offering 15 man raids. Considering loot drops, a 15 man format would be completely doable as well. You could still have 2 tanks with a dps/3rd tank role if needed. 4 healers with 1 dps/healer offspec and 7 dps roles. I know this is likely futile and a waste of my time but I wanted to put it out there. 15 mans would likely work well for many guilds who can't quite push it to 25s but have too many viable raiders for 10s.</div></div><hr />

25s was a must, not even an option abck in the day whcih made guilds die fast. Now its all about the 10s since guilds can pug easily and not be in to bad of a shape, not to mention handing out loot. If they make 25s gear higher it will crumble more guilds then ever before</div></div><hr />

We want to reward players who keep playing. Too often in the past catch up was so easy that it trivialized accomplishments.<br />

<br />
I wouldn't agree. it was time of Cataclysm and that's the time the drop happened. also, I have problems with gearing up, playing max 5hrs a week but I'd rather have it like this opposed to getting 1-90 in 5 days /played and getting geared in a week. if you can't gear your 10th alt, sorry, stick to 1-2 only.<br />
<br />
the most god awful thing that can happen is Blizzard catering to &quot;too&quot; casuals.<br />
<br />
and the quote up there about raid cauldrons, what? really? you can't organize 5 players in your guild to do some Herbalism work for 30ish min each? buy the darn Flasks and Potions at AH. there are plenty of people who would like to make money via alchemy which, except Living Steel, has no way to make money if you exclude Potions and Flasks.<br />
