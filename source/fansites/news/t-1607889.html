The Warlords of Draenor systems patch will be going live this week and it brings a lot of changes! Make sure your Background Downloader has downloaded the files so you aren't stuck waiting on patch day.<br />
<br />
This patch will convert your install to using the new CASC format, which can be a time consuming process. Be sure to defrag before and after the install if you are not using a SSD. The free version of Defraggler (https://www.piriform.com/defraggler/download) is a useful tool, as it can defrag just the WoW files if you are in a hurry.<br />
<br />

World of Warcraft Patch 6.0.2: The Iron Tide<br />
The official notes are here! For those of you that have been following along during beta, we summarized the changes from the previous set of notes here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1608480-Patch-6-0-2-Notes-Update?p=30005448#post30005448). Everyone else should take a look at the full notes!<br />

New Character Modelsnewcharactermodels<br />
After asking for updated character models for years, they are finally here! (Except for Blood Elves, which are coming in a later patch)<br />
<br />
If you don't like your new face, you can change it at the barber (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/september/poorChoices2.jpg). If you don't like the new models, you can switch to the old ones in the options.<br />

<br />
Stat Changesstatchanges<br />
<br />
The stat squish is finally here. Numbers will be much smaller, but combat should feel the same. Yes, you can still solo old raids.<br />
Health was not squished as much for PvP reasons. <br />
Spell Haste %, Melee Haste %, and Ranged Haste % have been merged into a universal Haste %. <br />
Spell Crit %, Melee Crit %, and Ranged Crit % have been merged into a universal Crit %. <br />
Dodge and Parry where changed<br />
<br />
The amount of Dodge gained per point of Agility has been reduced by 25%.<br />
The amount of Parry gained per point of Strength has been reduced by 25%. <br />
<br />
Attack Power was changed:<br />
<br />
Agility or Strength now grants 1 Attack Power (down from 2). All other sources of Attack Power now grant half as much as before. <br />
Weapon Damage values on all weapons have been reduced by 50%.<br />
Attack Power now increases Weapon Damage at a rate of 1 DPS per 3.5 Attack Power (up from 1 DPS per 14 Attack Power).<br />
Attack Power, Spell Power, or Weapon Damage now affect the entire healing or damage throughput of player spells.<br />
<br />
Cirtical Strike was changed:<br />
<br />
Agility and Intellect no longer provide Critical Strike<br />
Every class has a 5% base crit chance.<br />
Rogues, all Hunters, Feral and Guardian Druids, Brewmaster and Windwalker Monks, and Enhancement Shaman have an extra 10% chance to crit.<br />
<br />
Hit and Expertise were removed:<br />
<br />
Hit and Expertise bonuses on all items and item enhancements (gems, enchants, etc.) have been converted into Critical Strike, Haste, or Mastery.<br />
All characters now have a 100% chance to hit, 0% chance to be dodged, 3% chance to be parried, and 0% chance for glancing blows, when fighting creatures up to 3 levels higher (bosses included).<br />
Tanking specializations receive an additional 3% reduction in chance to be parried. Tank attacks now have a 0% chance to be parried vs. creatures up to 3 levels higher.<br />
Creatures that are 4 or more levels higher than the character still has a chance to avoid attacks in various ways, to discourage fighting enemies that are much stronger.<br />
Dual Wielding still imposes a 19% chance to miss, to balance it with two-handed weapon use. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Item Changesitemchanges<br />
<br />
Almost all flying mounts are now also ground mounts.<br />
Access to Ordos no longer requires a legendary cloak.<br />
Season 15 Prideful (Item Level 550) items should be available for honor.<br />
The direct benefit to combat perks from professions have been removed, such as the tailoring cloak enchants.<br />
Reforging is gone and all items have been reverted to their original state.<br />
Hit and Expertise have been removed from items and replaced with Critical Strike, Haste, or Mastery. You no longer have to worry about being hit capped!<br />
Dodge and Parry have been replaced with Bonus Armor. If an item had both Dodge and Parry on it, it has been replaced with an additional useful secondary stat. <br />
These changes have been applied to gems, enchants, food, and flasks. For example, hit gems (http://www.wowdb.com/items/76636-rigid-rivers-heart) are becoming crit gems (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/76636-rigid-rivers-heart).<br />
New secondary stats have been added and are on a few items: <br />
<br />
Bonus Armor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-bonus-armor-val=0&amp;filter-bonus-armor-op=1&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=90&amp;filter-reqlvl-max=90) - Increases Armor and Attack Power for tanking specializations. <br />
Multistrike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-multistrike-val=0&amp;filter-multistrike-op=1&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=90&amp;filter-reqlvl-max=90) - Grants a chance for spells and abilities to fire up to 2 additional times, at 30% effectiveness (both damage and healing). <br />
Versatility (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-versatility-val=0&amp;filter-versatility-op=1&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=90&amp;filter-reqlvl-max=90) - Increases damage, healing, and absorption done. Reduces damage taken. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AskMrRobot Updating<br />
AskMrRobot should be fully updated and ready to go on Tuesday with a new UI (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2014/10/top-things-to-know-for-patch-6-0-2/). Reforging may be gone, but gear optimization is still a part of the game. <br />
<br />
As an added bonus, the Best in Bags feature (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2014/10/what-to-do-for-6-0-2/) will be free this week, which should help you figure out which gear that you have is the best after reforges are undone. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately it appears that the API team was not as prepared, as they are predicting (http://us.battle.net/en/forum/topic/14579298057?page=2#22) API troubles with the new patch until Warlords release. If there are API issues, you can import your character with the AMR Addon (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/askmrrobot) as a manual import (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2014/02/armory-api-workaround/).<br />

<br />
<br />
Merged Auction Houseahchanges<br />
Players on the less populated faction will no longer have as much trouble finding things on the auction house, as Patch 6.0.2 merges the Alliance, Horde, and Neutral auction houses into one for each realm.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Black Market Auction House<br />
The Black Market Auction House has relocated to Draenor and the Pandaria location has been retired.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Currency ChangescurrencyChanges<br />
<br />
Item upgrades now cost 50 x Lesser Charm of Good Fortune (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/738-lesser-charm-of-good-fortune) each.<br />
Justice Points and Valor Points have been removed from the game. Most of the items that had a Justice or Valor cost are now sold for gold. <br />
Heirlooms are no longer available (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/339492-heirloom-vendor-change-in-patch-602/) to purchase with Justice Points, but you can buy them with other currencies. They will return in a future patch.<br />
Commendation Badges (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Commendation+Badge&amp;filter-source=6144) for Wrath of the Lich King reputations are no longer for sale (https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/519949524391825408).<br />
If you still need some gear, the Warforged Seal (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/776-warforged-seal) no longer has a weekly cap.<br />
The Key to the Palace of Lei Shen (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/94222-key-to-the-palace-of-lei-shen) no longer drops and In the Hall of the Thunder King (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/8106-in-the-hall-of-the-thunder-king) is now a Legacy achievement. Existing keys are still usable though!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Toy Boxtoybox<br />
The Toy Box is a collection of most of the toy items on your account. You can find a list of toys on the WoWDB PTR site (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-toy=1).<br />
<br />
<br />
The toy box is on the collections tab, next to the mounts and pets tab.<br />
Items in the toy box are available account wide.<br />
Only one copy of an item can be added to your toy box, so all of the others will have to be deleted.<br />
You can set toys as your favorite so that they appear at the start of the list.<br />
Toys that you haven't collected yet will list a source.<br />
You can filter toys by source and name.<br />
Some toys that can no longer be obtained aren't listed under Not Collected, but if you have them you can add them to the toy box.<br />
<br />

Patch 6.0.2 adds another tab to your regular bank that costs &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; to unlock and has 98 slots to store profession reagents. Keep in mind that profession reagents will now form much larger stacks, with many stacking to 200. You can craft with reagents from the Reagent Bank no matter where you are.<br />

Talent Changes<br />
While you won't have access to Level 100 talents, all of the other changes are going live with the patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exclusive glyphs cannot be used with each other. These are usually glyphs that both modify the same spell, such as Glyph of Ice Block (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/42744-glyph-of-ice-block) and Glyph of Regenerative Ice (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/110825-glyph-of-regenerative-ice).<br />
Some glyphs are learned automatically as you level, such as Glyph of Siphon Life (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/56218-glyph-of-siphon-life). These are earned at level 25, 50, 60, and 75.<br />

Guild Changesguildchanges<br />
Guild levels have been removed (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/322503-missing-guild-perks/#post6) for Warlords of Draenor, along with some of the perks that they provided. This includes the Cash Flow perk, which was causing players to form guilds and spam invite others to take advantage of the perk.<br />
<br />
Every guild now offers the same perks. Many of the perks that were removed are just applied to everyone now, even if they aren't in a guild. A list of the remaining perks is below.<br />

<br />
Group Findergroupfinder<br />
This patch also removes the old Raid Browser that got a temporary fix for Patch 5.4 and replaces it with a real Group Finder (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4243-Premade-Groups-Looking-for-Adventure).<br />
<br />
<br />
Creating a group first requires you to pick a category: Questing, Dungeons, Scenarios, Raids (MoP), Raids (Legacy), Arena Skirmishes, Battlegrounds, or Custom.<br />
<br />
Questing: Allows you to select the continent and zone<br />
Dungeons: Allows you to select random or a specific dungeon, as well as the difficulty.<br />
Scenarios: Allows you to select the scenario and difficulty.<br />
Raids - Allows you to select the raid and difficulty.<br />
Skirmishes - Allows you to select the size (2v2 or 3v3)<br />
<br />
After selecting the activity, you can add a title, description, minimum item level (your own or lower only), and voice chat.<br />
When browsing groups, you can see the number of players of each role in the group. <br />
When applying to a group, you can include a note to the leader.<br />
When in a group, you can see a list of everyone's role and item level.<br />
When someone applies to your group, you can see their Proving Grounds achievements.<br />
<br />

Siege of Orgrimmar Changessoochanges<br />
Siege of Orgrimmar is giving out Heirloom weapons and has been converted to the new Warlords of Draenor raid size system.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your first heirloom weapon (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/weapons?filter-reqlvl-min=90&amp;filter-quality=128) drop per difficulty (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/515140610630488064) is now guaranteed. These weapons will scale up while leveling and won't be replaced until at least level 100, so be sure to grab some for yourself and alts!<br />
The Warlords of Draenor raid size system will be applied to Siege of Orgrimmar:<br />
<br />
There are now four difficulties: Raid Finder, Normal (was Flex), Heroic (was Normal), and Mythic (was Heroic).<br />
Normal and Heroic will scale from 10 to 30 players. Raid Finder can also scale down if players drop group.<br />
Mythic will be a fixed size of 20 players.<br />
Each difficulty has its own weekly lockout. <br />
Raid Finder, Normal, and Heroic have a loot based lockout, which means you can kill bosses as many times as you would like, but you will only get loot in each difficulty once a week. The amount of loot that drops scales to the number of people eligible for loot, so you can't game the system.<br />
Mythic difficulty has an ID based lockout, similar to how Heroic lockouts have worked previously. You are locked to one raid ID for the week.<br />
<br />
The Ahead of the Curve (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/character?filter-search=Ahead+of+the+Curve+Garrosh) 10 (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/8398-ahead-of-the-curve-garrosh-hellscream-10-player) and 25 (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/8399-ahead-of-the-curve-garrosh-hellscream-25-player) achievements for killing Normal Garrosh are no longer be obtainable. These rewarded the Kor'kron War Wolf (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/148396-korkron-war-wolf) mount.<br />
The Cutting Edge (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/character?filter-search=Cutting+Edge+Garrosh) 10 (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/8400-cutting-edge-garrosh-hellscream-10-player) and 25 (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/8401-cutting-edge-garrosh-hellscream-25-player) achievements for killing Heroic Garrosh are also no longer obtainable. These achievement had no reward.<br />
The Kor'kron Juggernaut (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/104253-korkron-juggernaut) mount that drops from Heroic Garrosh isn't going away, but after Warlords is live it will be a rare drop instead of guaranteed. <br />
You can queue for Dragon Soul LFR once again, but there is no matchmaking. You must form your own group and travel to Auridormi (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/80675-auridormi) in the Caverns of Time to queue.<br />
<br />
<br />
OpenRaid Updated<br />
If you want to schedule a Siege of Orgrimmar run to get your Garrosh heirlooms, OpenRaid is ready with many groups already listed for Tuesday.<br />

Level 90 Upper Blackrock Spireubrs<br />
There is a special Level 90 version of the revamped Upper Blackrock Spire available for players during Patch 6.0.2. The loot is item level 550, which is better than Flex Siege of Orgrimmar gear that hasn't been upgraded yet. There will be an item level restriction (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/343980-level-90-ubrs/#post19) in place, but the dungeon is tuned for players with a few pieces of Raid Finder Siege of Orgrimmar gear, so it shouldn't be too high. <br />

Blasted Lands Questsblastedlands<br />
The Iron Horde have come through the red Dark Portal and taken over most of the Blasted Lands. Thrall (http://wowpedia.org/Thrall), Khadgar (http://wowpedia.org/Khadgar), Vindicator Maraad (http://wowpedia.org/Vindicator_Maraad), and other NPCs have set up small camps near the Dark Portal with a short quest line of standard kill, collect, and interact objectives.<br />
<br />
At the end of the quest line, Thrall will assist you in killing the leader of this Iron Horde assault. Turning in the final quest played the incorrect cinematic when we did this preview. You can see the correct cinematic here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPmWXdMYXuE). Quests were also very slightly tweaked since this preview, but nothing significant was changed.<br />
<br />
This quest line rewards the Iron Starlette (http://beta.wowdb.com/npcs/77221-iron-starlette) pet, the The Iron Invasion (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/9618-the-iron-invasion) achievement, and the &lt;Name&gt; of the Iron Vanguard (http://ptr.wowdb.com/titles/426-of-the-iron-vanguard) title.<br />

Arena Skirmishesskirmishes<br />
Players have been asking for skirmishes back for a long time and they finally make their return in Patch 6.0.2!<br />
<br />
<br />
Skirmishes have no visible ratings, unlike regular arenas. There is a hidden rating used for loose matchmaking to keep things a little more balanced.<br />
Skirmishes are only offered in 2v2 and 3v3 sizes.<br />
You can queue for a skirmish solo or with a group.<br />
Skirmishes will reward honor (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517017291020853250).<br />
If you run across someone you enjoyed playing with, you can queue again with them at the end of a match.<br />
<br />

<br />
UI Improvementsuiupgrades<br />
The default UI has received several upgrades:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Dungeon Journal now includes short overviews of the fight for each role, which should help players that don't know the fights. <br />
The Key Binding UI has also been improved to a tabbed list rather than a very long list you have to scroll through. <br />
You are now able to manage addons in game without having to log out. <br />
Bags have several improvements:<br />
<br />
The default UI now allows you to assign item types to certain bags, search your bags, and auto sort your bags. <br />
Junk items in your bags display a gold coin icon when you are at a vendor, letting you know it is safe to vendor them.<br />
Items in your bag have a item quality colored border around the icon.<br />
<br />
The Mount Journal has several improvements:<br />
<br />
The journal now lists a source and description for mounts.<br />
You are now able to set mounts as favorites, putting them at the top of the list.<br />
There is a new Summon Random Favorite Mount button, which selects a usable mount at random from your favorites.<br />
Mounts that are faction specific now have a different background in the list.<br />
<br />
The map and quest log have several improvements:<br />
<br />
The quest log has been integrated into the map.<br />
The map now becomes transparent when you are moving.<br />
The map is now zoomable and draggable.<br />
If you prefer a fullscreen map still, you can make it fullscreen. M will then open the map and L will open the quest log and map combination.<br />
<br />
You can now scroll through your spellbook with the mouse wheel.<br />
Quest objectives, NPCs, your target, and mouseover all can have outlines now. These replace the old sparkles used to show quest objectives. <br />
The default action bars can now show cooldown duration in numbers.<br />
There is a now screen that gives you a list of a few of the big new things in a patch.<br />
The client now tones down or hides some less important spells when things are visually cluttered. This should increase performance in group content and make it easier to see what is going on. <br />
Graphics settings (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/raidAndBGGraphics.jpg) can be changed automatically to your presets in raids and battlegrounds. <br />

Undelete Character Featureundeletechar<br />
In the upcoming pre-Warlords of Draenor content patch, we’re adding a new feature that allows players to undelete characters. But before you delete that character, there are a few limitations we want you to let you to know about first.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters under level 10 and Death Knights at level 55 are not eligible to be undeleted.<br />
Characters between level 10 and level 29 will no longer recoverable after 90 days.<br />
Characters between level 30 and 49 will no longer recoverable after 120 days.<br />
All other characters level 50 and above are eligible to be undeleted at any time.<br />
Please keep in mind you will only be able to use the undelete option once every 30 days.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Reclaiming Your Name: What About Flugur?<br />
We’ll be holding deleted character names for a limited time, and the original creator can reclaim it for use on a new character during that time. If you create a new character with the same name as one of your deleted characters (let’s say Flugur), the new character must be renamed, transferred, or deleted to complete the restoration of the original Flugur.<br />
<br />
<br />
Server Responsiveness Improvementsresponsiveness<br />
I don't want to get too deep into the under-the-hood workings of WoW servers, but here's a super short version. Any action that one unit takes on another different unit used to be processed in batches every 400ms. Some very attentive people may have noticed that healing yourself would give you the health instantly (minus client/server latency), whereas healing another unit would incur a delay of between 0ms and 400ms (again, on top of client/server latency). Same with damaging, applying auras, interrupting, knocking back, etc.<br />
<br />
That delay can feel bad just due to the somewhat laggy responsiveness feeling, but also because the state of things can change during that time. For example: Holly the Holy Priest is healing Punky the Brewmaster. Punky spikes low, and Holly hits Guardian Spirit in a panic. The server verifies that Holly is able to cast it, and that Punky is alive (great!). The cast goes off, Guardian Spirit goes on cooldown, and a request is placed for the Guardian Spirit aura (that prevents dying) to be placed on Punky. That request will be filled next time the 400ms timer loops, which happens to be 320ms from now. 250ms later, the boss lands another hit on on Punky. Punky dies. Sadface. Another 70ms goes by, and the Guardian Spirit aura request pops up, and goes &quot;Hey guys, I'm here!... Aww... damn, I missed the party. Sadface.&quot;<br />
<br />
We no longer batch them up like that. We just do it as fast as we can, which usually amounts to between 1ms and 10ms later. It took a considerable amount of work to get it working that way, but we're very pleased with the results so far; the game feels noticeably more responsive.<br />
<br />
I can't guarantee that you'll never ever again run into cases where Guardian Spirit went on cooldown and the tank still died... but it'll be literally 40x rarer than before, and the whole game will feel more responsive too.<br />
<br />

Anti-Aliasingaachanges<br />
The old MSAA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing) option is now gone. In its place is FXAA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_approximate_anti-aliasing) and CMAA (https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/conservative-morphological-anti-aliasing-cmaa-update) options. These offer reduced jaggniess at less of a performance cost than MSAA, but tend to result in somewhat blurrier images. You can find more details in the related tech blog (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4322-Engineer%E2%80%99s-Workshop-Engine-Evolution-in-Warlords-of-Draenor).<br />

I think it is going the personal LFR / Flex route though I have heard that the RL could make it master looter but not sure on that.. I think I also read somewhere that the LFR / Flex loot system is also going to be used in dungeons but again not entirely sure on that..</div></div><hr />

It's probably safer as MS, the creators of NTFS, created it - and they are the only ones that really know the details of NTFS.<br />

<br />
FXAA is one of the first post process AAs (PPAA). It's aliasing detection algorithm is very primitive, resulting in a lot of false positives - hence the blur that many complain about. The only benefit of FXAA is that it's very cheap, cheapest among all PPAAs.<br />
<br />
CMAA is an offshoot of MLAA and cousin to SMAA that it shares a lot with. CMAA is just more &quot;conservative&quot; than SMAA - hence the &quot;C&quot; in CMAA. Both SMAA and CMAA have much better aliasing detection - ergo, less blurring - and attempts to guess the subpixel details which it then reconstructs.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
MSAA isn't &quot;real AA&quot; either. It's a cheap ass approximation of SSAA (the only real AA; that is way too expensive to be practical in the vast majority of real time use cases).<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
In very simple terms, <br />
<br />
FXAA really just blurrs EVERYTHING to make it look smoother<br />
CMAA, is a proper AA method but it doesn't do as good a job as the older methods and also I don't think it applies any AA to transparent textures which means things like leaves on trees look like they do without any AA (which means awful).<br />
<br />
CMAA does AA alpha textures. It's MSAA that doesn't although it can be modified to by adding alpha to coverage.</div></div><hr />

Right now my quest log is full if several completed Brawler's Guild quests which I've been saving for this very day (final day before patch) because I didn't have the space to store all of the shirts. I'm extremely happy for these storage changes. The second Void tab, reagent tab, and toy box mean that I will free up a ton of space.</div></div><hr />

Each difficulty has its own weekly lockout.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
Loot goes like this: Raid Finder, Normal, and Heroic have a loot based lockout, which means you can kill bosses as many times as you would like, but you will only get loot in each difficulty once a week. The amount of loot that drops scales to the number of people eligible for loot, so you can't game the system.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
K, confusing it said before that instances had their own weekly lockout but then it says Mythic difficulty has an ID based lockout, similar to how Heroic lockouts have worked previously. You are locked to one raid ID for the week. anyone else find this strange? Or is it a typo?</div></div><hr />

No. The expansion grants you the access to Draenor and everything associated with it e.g. garrisons, raids &amp; dungeons, level cap increase etc. Everything listed on this page is available to everyone.</div></div><hr />

As for the changes with classes and specs and all that other stuff, I do see a massive amount of creativity lost in all of this. Plus if you notice, their 'pruning' is just so they can re-add abilities in as Glyphs or as Talents because they were too lazy to fix anything at all. They've pretty much made me decide never to play a DK tank again because I hated Death Coil on all three specs and now its a standard, Paladins and Warriors got massively boned by a serious drop in primary and secondary stat bonuses from their specializations and every class I wasn't playing has been pretty much gutted and set out to dry in a nice neat pile next to them.</div></div><hr />

The removal of mounts has been going on since Vanilla - Black bug mount, plagued proto drake, black proto drake - so on and so forth. This is nothing new. <br />
<br />
<br />
Is the korkron juggernaut a guaranteed drop until the expansion or is it a rare drop as of tomorrow? I don't have it yet.<br />
<br />
To the best of my knowledge - it will continue to be a 100% drop until WoD comes out. However, you can only get it on &quot;mythic&quot; difficulty which will be a 20 man raid. To offset that, I do believe that 2 mounts will drop per kill on 20 man mythics. I am not 100% certain on that aspect though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mostly no.<br />
<br />
MSAA can't be forced via drivers for deferred rendering.<br />
<br />
nVidia though has DSR (it's effectively supersampling) that can be forced on any game that allows multiple resolutions and has UI scaling. That said, it only available for the latest line of cards. It's also taxing on your GPU, it's supersampling, so unless your video card is super, it will just be a slide show.</div></div><hr />

It's simply an unnecessary redundant performance hit for game companies to want to hide all their files inside another file system on your existing file system. In the old days this was done because of limitations of file systems and to hide things from the players. Now players just write their own tools to unpack these things anyway. On top of that WoW is the most ubiquitously spoiled title in existence right now, so just put the damn files in the WoW folder so we don't keep suffering dumb performance hits managing all the files inside of the big container file system.</div></div><hr />

As someone mentioned above, this assumes people leave their computers on, or out of sleep mode. I keep my Win 7 computer on, and disk defragmenter says it's set to run on the 1st of every month, but also states the last time it defragged was back in February, when I last manually did it. I'd suggest people check for themselves and manually do it if their puters aren't actually defragging on schedule.</div></div><hr />

Also, I think if it's one of the ones with an achievement for getting it you might be able to recover it... also, there is a toy vendor in Stormwind who sells things like 'the pigskin'. Might be one in Org, think there's one in Dal... worth having a look.</div></div><hr />

That's only valid if you have your PC running at the time the defrag task is scheduled. From personal experience, that is never the case. And you don't need the program in the article regardless, because defraging only WoW files makes no sense what so ever.</div></div><hr />

Dude - I am sorry you didn't get the mount (if you weren't able to get it last night) but the simple fact of the matter is that Blizz does retire mounts...a lot of them http://www.warcraftmounts.com/retired.php and it sucks - but it does push (me anyway) to get the mounts as quickly as possible simply because I do not know if that particular mount will be available for the entire run of the game.<br />
<br />
To the &quot;special circumstances&quot; instance. The wolf was a reward for a &quot;special circumstance&quot; achievement - downing normal Garrosh before the patch. Just the wording of the achievement lets you know that it was not permanent. Again, I am sorry if you didn't get it - but it was known it would not be around after SoO was no longer current content. To that end - SoO lasted for almost two years...plenty of time if someone truly wanted to get it.</div></div><hr />

Probably going to have to uninstall Dark Souls 2 because WoW..<br />

Not entirely accurate. As the conversion processes each MPQ, it deletes it. At the end of the conversion you should be at or around the same folder size if you've already downloaded all of the 6.0.2 data to this point, and should only need around 4GB free for the conversion itself.<br />
<br />
You should live.</div></div><hr />

I am betting on 18 to 20 hour maintenance, have alternate plans for the evening.<br />
<br />
Guess I should have taken that bet...</div></div><hr />
