Destiny 2 is coming to Battle.Net! This announcement is especially interesting after the announcement about transitioning away from the Battle.net name (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/768810-battlenet-update/).<br />
We want to let everyone know that a new game will be appearing alongside your favorite Blizzard games—one that’s a little different from what you might normally expect. Bungie’s upcoming first-person action game Destiny 2 will be joining the party! We’re excited to announce that we're partnering with Bungie and Activision to support the PC version of Destiny 2 exclusively via Battle.net.<br />
<br />
We’re big fans of Destiny here at Blizzard, and we’re honored to be able to help the talented folks at Bungie and Activision bring their much-anticipated sequel to a new platform. Being on Battle.net will allow Destiny 2 to plug in to our existing global network, freeing up the developers at Bungie to focus their energy and resources on making the best and most fun game they possibly can. This also means Destiny 2 players will have access to our online social functionality, including chat with friends, the ability to see which of their friends are online in Destiny 2 or in Blizzard games, and the ability to stream gameplay directly to Facebook.<br />
<br />
See the FAQ below for further platform details, and stay tuned for updates as we get closer to welcoming Destiny 2 and its players to Battle.net. To learn more about Destiny 2, head over to www.destinythegame.com (http://www.destinythegame.com/).<br />

<br />
<br />
Why are you adding a non-Blizzard game to Blizzard's platform?<br />
We loved Destiny and think Destiny 2 is going to be a great game. Blizzard has an established and successful global internet infrastructure we’ve used for years to support our own games. Creating a new network client for Destiny 2, which is bringing the franchise to PC for the first time, would needlessly extend the development period for the game. We want to get our hands on Destiny 2 as soon as possible like everybody else, so we offered to share our PC platform with our sister companies for this release.<br />
<br />
Does this mean other games are going to come to the Blizzard platform too?<br />
Our focus in terms of supporting non-Blizzard games is solely around Destiny 2. Aside from potentially evaluating needs or opportunities for future Activision games, we don’t have any short- or long-term plans to support third-party games with Battle.net. It’s important to us to maintain our quality standards for any experience or service we’re putting in front of our players, which represents a big investment of time and effort on our part, so this is not something we’re jumping into lightly.<br />
<br />
Does this mean I'll be able to use my Blizzard Balance to purchase Destiny 2?<br />
Yes!<br />
<br />
Will Destiny 2 offer the same cross-game social features that Blizzard titles currently have?<br />
Destiny 2 will be integrated into many of Blizzard’s existing social features—you’ll be able to chat with friends playing Destiny 2 the same way you already can for Blizzard games. Players will also be able to add friends and form parties the same way Blizzard gamers can. And, you’ll see a Destiny 2 status icon by your friends who are playing Destiny 2 the same way you do for friends playing StarCraft II, Diablo III, WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, and Overwatch.<br />
<br />
Where and when will Destiny 2 on PC be available?<br />
We’re excited to work with Bungie to bring the PC version of Destiny 2 to every region Blizzard currently operates in. Bungie is actively working through the global details. We look forward to sharing additional information later this year.<br />
<br />
Who will be operating Destiny 2’s servers?<br />
Bungie will maintain Destiny 2’s servers; Blizzard’s servers will be used for features related to the Blizzard platform, such as login and social functionality.<br />
<br />
And what about customer service?<br />
Destiny 2’s gameplay customer service will be handled by Bungie; Blizzard will handle customer service for platform and shop issues specific to our service.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably because all blizzard games got a certain blizzard-touch to it that other game developers can't even dream of making.<br />
When you start to mix other games from other developers into the game-launcher and other stuff the whole thing will loose much of its quality. That is if you believe the classical rule of quality before quantity.<br />
<br />
I also see this as a bad sign. Might be wrong tho</div></div><hr />

Doubtful considering blizzard's is only handling the Login/Social part of it, Nothing to do with the actual game itself. Sure there might be some cross talk but doubt it will be like that.</div></div><hr />

People have been speculating that Activision had a massive negative influence on new Blizzard games for many years and I'm honestly surprised it took them this long to shove their foot in the door and shoehorn their way into Blizzard's products. Don't be surprised if you see Activision/Blizzard simply change their overall name to Blizzard in the coming years. Are you ready for a world in which Blizzard publishes quality games like Call of Duty? It's going to happen.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard right now says this is just for Destiny 2, but who knows. Perhaps they will expand Battle.net into a platform that can deliver games similar to Steam, Uplay, Origin, etc. I read recently about people saying Steam is too close to being a monopoly on online game delivery so Blizzard could become a competitor. I would trust Blizzard to make B.net into be a better alternative than some of the other choices I listed, and right now the Microsoft Store does not really seem to cater to gaming.<br />

Since it's on Battle.net I suppose we'll be able to buy it thank to WoW Token ? Might be a good commercial opportunity for Activision Blizzard, since people might want to spend their gold to test this new game they could not afford with $$$.<br />
<br />
I suspect the answer would be no. It would be very awkward if you could farm one game's currency to buy real money tokens that can trade in for other games. This is not possible even between Blizzard's own games (can't trade Diablo gold for WoW game time, for example). However, B.net does have the infrastructure for in-game purchases so it's very likely Destiny 2 might have DLC that can be bought through B.net.</div></div><hr />

When you start to mix other games from other developers into the game-launcher and other stuff the whole thing will loose much of its quality. That is if you believe the classical rule of quality before quantity.<br />
<br />
I also see this as a bad sign. Might be wrong tho<br />

Affect the launcher sure. I can't see how this would affect the quality of blizzard's own games though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Destiny is actually very similar to Blizzards &quot;titan&quot; project. It's obvious to me that's the REAL reason blizzard fucking scrapped titan. They are both multiplayer first person shooter games in an open world. Basically an mmorpg. Activision came in and said 'hey we can't have you putting out competition for our mmorpgfps, scrap that massive project, make some silly battleground game like team fortress and we will cross Promote Destiny with you.' Just because your only hearing it now doesn't mean this deal was struck last week. These companies plan shit like this years and even decades in advance.</div></div><hr />

People will be buying Destiny (and prob services for it) by paying w/ b.net balance which can be topped up by using WoW Tokens, so Bungie will be getting their share (game, service, etc price) and Blizz will be getting theirs (each WoW Token is $5 profit, even if redeemed $15 were spent on Bungie title), noice :p</div></div><hr />

To be fair as far as technical prowess and simply creating software that works bungie is to console as Blizzard is to PC. People can complain about balance and shit but these games work and if they don't they fix them ASAP. Its part of why Blizzard and bungie are both as successful and almost revered as they are on their platforms. I think this is why a bungie title is the perfect choice for the first non Blizzard product to be put on the launcher. If I were them I wouldn't trust anyone else enough to risk my brand taking a little bit of a beating if it doesn't go well.</div></div><hr />

Activision owns Blizzard, Activision holds exclusive publishing rights to Destiny and all future Destiny titles, and is in partnership with Bungie. It makes sense to put it on the Launcher that won't cost anything extra to put it on. Sure its going to bring them more money then putting it on steam, but its not like its some third party company that PAID blizzard to put it on the launcher, both Blizzard Entertainment and Bungie are part of the Activision entity, they just hold on to the rights of their own IP in the the event that they split off from Activision.</div></div><hr />

Either way, only thing i'm kind of worried about is having the game shoved down my throat through more cross-games promotions.

If that was indeed the case, why are we not seeing massive games like CoD on the platform?<br />
<br />
The reason why the game is integrated onto the b.net platform is because the gameplay is similar to every other Blizzard games - in fact I remember reading an article from Kotaky from a few years ago, explaining how Bungie called upon the developpers of D3 (who worked on the xpac) to help them make meaningful design decisions.<br />
<br />
I frankly believe it's not just Activision using this as their own personal platform, but instead Blizzard expanding their launcher to fit with products which has the same philosophy.</div></div><hr />

All of our guild mates and my RL friends call it BattleNet - I do not think it will ever change. Maybe the next generation will call it that name - whenever that is after the millions of people installing it with Overwatch, HS and so on. XD<br />

I welcome Destiny 2. It is a smart move, for both companies (given that many Destiny Devs used to be working for Blizzard, even more so).<br />
Destiny 1 was wonderfully saved with the revamp and got even better with every Expac. They surely picked up from there and therefore I will look forward to be playing Destiny 2 with my friends and possibly guild mates between WoW and whatever else.</div></div><hr />

In a way, you could ask the question &quot;Why reinvent the wheel?&quot;. What is the point in building up a social platform, when there already exists one. Sure they could have gone with steam... But then again, both Bungie and Blizzard are owned by Activision. It might be more logical for them to use their platform.<br />

You can give proof of a quality of a game that will exist in a few months.

When you start to mix other games from other developers into the game-launcher and other stuff the whole thing will loose much of its quality. That is if you believe the classical rule of quality before quantity.<br />
<br />
I also see this as a bad sign. Might be wrong tho<br />

Blizzard has literally fuck all to do with the game, Activision simply got to put it up on battle.net. If anything this is huge for wow players who love the game and have some currency on their b.net account.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Far smaller companies, with much smaller populations for their games, have their own clients. Tera, Wildstar come to mind. The notion that Bungie, backed by Activision/Blizzard money can't afford the money or the time to make their own is laughable.<br />
Blizzard isn't owned by Activision. Blizzard and Activision are the same company.<br />
<br />
They can of course do as they please. I just see this as a breach of consistency and breaking their own words, by saying that the app is a platform for Blizzard games. So if they want to change that, they should go all out with it, and not be dishonest about it.<br />
Activision has the money and the capacity to make their own client if they wanted to, but they don't, because a place like Blizzards app has as you said all the work already done. And they don't want to be involved with Steam, because that'd add an extra hand into the process that they can't control or manage.<br />
<br />
My gripe with this is that it's clearly against what Blizzard has always said, that Blizzard is Blizzard and that's all it's gonna be. I don't buy this corporate talk of &quot;helping out&quot;. Bungie completely capable of doing it on their own.<br />
Bungie is gonna handle everything except for log-ins, authentication and social functions. That's what makes this such meaningless &quot;help&quot;.<br />
<br />
I know my complaint is probably ridiculous if you don't care for principles and coherency. But I'm a real fanatic about that. Bungie doesn't need this help. They really don't. THe reasoning is complete bullshit. They want to publish this game as fast as possible and cut corners doing so, so sayeth the investors.<br />
I would have zero issue with them putting more Activision/Blizzard games on the app, at all. I welcome it. Competition to Steam is needed. But this story of generosity is bullshit and completely dishonest.</div></div><hr />

Really? If you've been in development of games you'd also know what a rollercoaster ride development can be. Just look at how Overwatch came to be and how uncertain that was for a long time. They didn't even know if people would like it, but they went with it and it worked.<br />
If you have to name yourself a AAA-developer you'll have to back that up with some info on what you've worked with and whom, if you don't mind. Otherwise it's hard to believe you when you say you talk from experience and insight.<br />
<br />
I disagree, this is entirely pressure from Activision and their investors. Blizzard could've supported any other game at all. Destiny 2 isn't lacking in money nor development time. This is cutting corners for a quicker launch. Convenience. Blizzard could've of course said no, but I think they see the money in this as well. It's a lucrative opportunity, because it puts Destiny 2 and Blizzards game next to one another, something one or the other is gonna benefit from.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jokerfiend</div><div class="date">2017-05-18, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the inside story ppl. <br />
<br />
Destiny is actually very similar to Blizzards &quot;titan&quot; project. It's obvious to me that's the REAL reason blizzard fucking scrapped titan. They are both multiplayer first person shooter games in an open world. Basically an mmorpg. Activision came in and said 'hey we can't have you putting out competition for our mmorpgfps, scrap that massive project, make some silly battleground game like team fortress and we will cross Promote Destiny with you.' Just because your only hearing it now doesn't mean this deal was struck last week. These companies plan shit like this years and even decades in advance.<br />
<br />
This is probably closer to the truth, than most people realize. I have a couple of questions, though.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard is it's own, like Activison said it was, then why wasn't Steam used or some other platform? Considering it's not a Blizzard product, Bungie is handling all of the servers, and Blizzard would more than likely not allow this to happen.<br />
<br />
Are more games coming to Blizzard App, that aren't from Activision?<br />
<br />
I dunno, I'm leaning to the side the Activision has more say in the company then Blizzard is letting on. Have felt this way for years. Yet, something like this is way more than spooky circumstances, for me.</div></div><hr />

Hm, so it seems that the decision to use the Blizzard client would be to save time so that the PC version will get to launch closer to the console version, so the sales for the PC version can be better? BEcause if it's really late, I reckon it won't sell good on PC.<br />

Yeah this is also probably a big dealbreaker in this. But I understand their unwillingness to go to Steam. But I really think they should just develop their own platform instead or expand the Blizzard one into an Activision-Blizzard platform. Because this is Blizzards platform right now, not Bungies nor Activisions. But this sends the message that it no longer is, which is my gripe with it.</div></div><hr />

Destiny is already an Activision game. There's no reason every Activision game doesn't just move over to Battle.net and dump Steam.<br />

(also thank god people are still calling it BNET cause fuck Blizzard App)<br />

You should've read what the post said.<br />
Blizzard provides the client, which means they only handle log-ins, authentication and cross-game social features but that's it. Bungie have the servers and all that stuff.<br />

The story was really weak though. Forgettable and some times even incoherent. If that changes they might have a more solid game yes.<br />

This is a smart cash grab for them. You can use the bnet tokens to buy it so now more people will buy it via that. As a result Activision/Blizzard gets about 20 extra bucks per game and at the same time dumps a few more active people into WoW even if only briefly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zandalarian Paladin</div><div class="date">2017-05-18, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really? If you've been in development of games you'd also know what a rollercoaster ride development can be. Just look at how Overwatch came to be and how uncertain that was for a long time. They didn't even know if people would like it, but they went with it and it worked.<br />
If you have to name yourself a AAA-developer you'll have to back that up with some info on what you've worked with and whom, if you don't mind. Otherwise it's hard to believe you when you say you talk from experience and insight.<br />
<br />
I disagree, this is entirely pressure from Activision and their investors. Blizzard could've supported any other game at all. Destiny 2 isn't lacking in money nor development time. This is cutting corners for a quicker launch. Convenience. Blizzard could've of course said no, but I think they see the money in this as well. It's a lucrative opportunity, because it puts Destiny 2 and Blizzards game next to one another, something one or the other is gonna benefit from.<br />
<br />
Oh, development is hectic. Sadly, and because I've been literally crept on by someone with barely my internet username (which I changed since then, hence the very bad name I have right now), I've decided to not give too much information about that anymore. All I can say is that I used to work at Ubisoft, but I've since left to work on my own projects and University in computer sciences.<br />
<br />
Since we're talking about Destiny, you should know that a few months prior to launch, they've completely scrapped the lore and started back at point 0. Now, that part isn't really big news, it's been covered everywhere. But the interesting part here is Blizzard and how they played a role directly with the Destiny team: http://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731<br />
<br />
I really recommend reading it. If anything, it's a good insight into the VG development's cycle.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, you are right that both has something to gain from this. After all, they are businesses. The interesting part here is that Activision own a lot of games. A really huge amount of them. So the decision to accept, say, Destiny (which is not even close to a number of sales a CoD can generate) over any other, more successful, game is the interesting argument here. So while it's fair to say that both have something to gain out of it, I think it's really important to understand the fact that Destiny is a game that has a core philosophy very close to Blizzard's own. Otherwise, the battle.net app would already be filled with hundreds of games from the Activision department.<br />
<br />
I want to precise what I meant with the &quot;Blizzard employees have been able to play Destiny early&quot;. A few things you should know: Blizzard HQ is highly protected digitally. Nothing goes out at all. Other Activision branches can't play the games from Blizzard. I can't speak for QA though, as I know Activision tend to playtest their games all over their studios, but then again that's irrelevant since QA aren't the ones making this decision. Blizzard itself is, therefore, an entirely independent team which own itself and Activision knows better than to meddle with them. If Blizzard decided to move out of Activision, which they definitely could considering their assets, that would be catastrophic and investors would start looking for whom to execute. Anyway, I'm getting sidetracked here.<br />
<br />
Now, Blizzard's team leads, producers, and directors have most likely played the game. It's a common practice in studios to have developers play other games in development so the &quot;knowledge&quot; can be shared. You also have meetings with several higher ups where games like these get presented to a large, in-company closed-door audience at a very early stage.<br />
<br />
I can't say for Blizzard themselves, as I have very little knowledge of what's happening inside the Blizzard HQ. But if I am to believe my own experience and my friends/colleagues working inside Activision's branches, this is not a decision pushed by Activision but something entirely independent.</div></div><hr />

Technically Blizzard Entertainment is a Child Company to parent ActiVision Blizzard, hence how Blizzard Entertainment can still have its own CEO (Mike Morhaime) while ActiVision Blizzard has its own CEO.<br />

I don't think that will be the case. Because of one simple &quot;fact&quot;: Destiny 2 is not from a Blizzard universe. The reason why other blizzard games have cross-game rewards is because it makes sense, they are &quot;tied&quot; together, different titles but still they belong to one entity. Destiny 2 is a completely different entity. <br />
My strong belief is that Activision wants to &quot;lure in&quot; Blizzard players (since the playerbase across the entire battle.net is vast) they can earn more $$$. I'm almost certain Blizz won't care to create promo content for Destiny 2 like rewards because it's not their game but I'm sure Blizz will get a piece of the pie as well (after all, if you play Destiny 2 you probably won't have time to play WoW and so on so a compensation for a possible lack of players in Blizzard games needs to be in place). But hey, this is just a theory....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Finding out that Destiny 2 is coming to pc, and on battle.net of all things, is a huge surprise for me. I must say I'm really excited. I'm not saying that the game being on battle.net automatically makes the game &quot;better&quot; (it's not Blizzard who's making the game after all), and I understand the skepticism about what that means for the future of the launcher itself, but I think this is good news.<br />
<br />
And complaints about extra icon on the launcher, seriously? It's not wow launcher people, let the rest of us who enjoy playing multiple Blizzard games enjoy playing something different while still chatting with our friends. I also welcome potential cross-game events (doubtful since it's not an actual Blizzard game) like the nexus challenge, for example.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard Entertainment as a company from Mike Morhaime down is a Subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, while not entirely ownership, all activision execs reside in positions over Blizzard Entertainment execs. Mike Morhaime and Robert Kotick are not equals within the company.<br />

Oh and all of Blizzards games are also on this platform. I mean this is something they could even pay for.

Now they will all be exposed to them, and this is crazy amounts of marketing earnings for Blizzard. Mad props to them for pulling this one off.</div></div><hr />

This is a profitable deal for Blizzard, regardless of Activisions part in it. Don't be daft.<br />

Keep maintenance on a service they already have support established for. Add big title. Gain profit from exposure to your titles. It's quite simple really. &quot;We really love Destiny 2&quot; could be translated to, &quot;fuck yeaeaaa boy big moneys&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has all the exposure they need, they don't need some cheap copy past pile a crap to get them a bad rep... But again this is blizzards wallets talking.<br />

You can never have too much exposure. Especially from Destiny 2 players (Bungie fans) that may or may not have been in contact with Blizzard before. It's a goldmine more or less. And it should be blatantly obvious at this point that Blizzard is a company that is run and owned by shareholders :rolleyes:, their main goal is to make that share go up. Games is just a way to get there.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't trust anyone else for that. To put the game on the b.net platform means that Blizzard personally backs it, which to me is all I needed as proof of quality.<br />

<br />
D3 launch was a catastrophe, but you're disingenuous if you say that the expansion was bad. WoD also had a lot of very strong points, they sadly has been overwhelmed by the content drought (which is only an issue from a game design perspective).<br />
<br />
Frankly, to say that these were bad is to have a shallow reasoning. The story, the art, the gameplay was brilliant in both of these. But the game design failed to deliver for both. And one was successfully fixed when the expansion was released, while the other is still being worked on actively.</div></div><hr />

You can buy tokens for gold from the character select screen. Select &quot;Reactivate Now&quot; and you will get an option to buy a token, it will also show the current gold price for tokens so you know how much you are spending on that server.</div></div><hr />

Despite what Blizzard and Activision may say to the contrary, this is not a one-off. It's testing the waters and establishing the precedent. It's another example of a AAA publisher wanting to have their own little slice of the digital storefront pie without any of the bad PR EA/Ubi got for Origin/UPlay and it's a dilution of what it tangibly means to be &quot;in the Blizzard ecosystem&quot;.<br />
