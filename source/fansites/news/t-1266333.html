The game will never die. It's not sub based. They get the money from the initial release, and btw lucky for them it was the highest selling PC game ever. Blizzard inherited a gold mine from D3. Stop whining. D3 isn't that bad now. It has come a long way.</div></div><hr />

Yea, because Diablo 3 isn't doing better than WoW at all... And also, this isn't the first time Blizzard has brought a game to console... Diablo was released on the original playstation many years ago.<br />
<br />
Just google Diablo original playstation and look at the wiki page.</div></div><hr />

pay to win in a Single Player game? dont be silly. its not an MMO. If you dont want to buy stuff on the AH then DONT! i tell you that you will enjoy diablo 3 more if you play on ur own pace without using the AH at all with only ur own drops and blacksmith stuff.</div></div><hr />

Yep that's it. I guess it wasn't the atrociously itemized items, the gated acts, only 4 players allowed to play in a game, the top 1% of rolls being worth anything, the purely idiotic rng when it comes to legendaries, the pay to win feature, bmah, no stat allocation, the whole &quot;we have 8 billion builds!&quot; and 1-2 being viable in inferno, nope you're right it. It was those damn annual pass holders who knew nothing about this abomination that they tacked onto the diablo franchise</div></div><hr />

<br />
it has its followers. But its player base has shrunk to less than 10% of what it started with. <br />
<br />
If your using your anecdotal evidence, then ill use mine.<br />
I had a total of 14 friends buy D3 with me. They all quit within a week, and 3 of them actually got a refund.<br />
<br />
Several of them also went on to check back up on the game months later, nothing improved besides the playability issues that should have never been an issue in the first place. The &quot;large crowd&quot; is not large by any sort of metric.<br />
<br />
I dont think annual pass holders had nothing to do with it. In its current state, I would wager more people would rather play QWOP with their feet than to play D3</div></div><hr />

The issue is that they made games and ported them to the PC. So games like Halo and Call of Duty were made for the console then ported to PC so they always looked like shit. Where as games like BF3 and Skyrim and now D3 were made for the PC and ported to the console. As long as they make it for the PC FIRST then and consoles SECOND, you won't have the issue that Halo and CoD have with shitty computer graphics.</div></div><hr />

But LOVED spending days and months doing nothing but Meph or Bahl runs. Over and over and over. Instead of a semi challenging Pack of trash you mainly just spawned a game ran thru to boss killed it and re spawned a new game. Don't get me wrong i loved D2 and spent ALOT of time playing the game. And yes the items that spawn on this one have some of the worst itemization ive seen on some items every in a game. Expecialy Class specific items.

<br />
The issue isn't with graphics but the controls - PC games are usually developed for keyboard and/or mouse and console games for controllers. Ports from console to PC are usually very clumsy when played on a keyboard/mouse (Devil May Cry series leaps to my mind, as a reason I bought an xbox controller to my PC). By the way, Skyrim was developed for both consoles and PC and it shows - the controls on PC are very console-y (the inventory alone, compare it with Oblivion's) and I actually found it better playable with a gamepad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know I really liked it and put well over one hundred and fifty hours into it, sure, it has some problems but I think it was a really solid title and a reasonable continuation of Diablo's story, albeit with some all too easily predicted 'twists'.<br />
<br />
As for the announcement itself... well its 'good' I guess, but I personally thing its a bit late in the day to bother with releasing it on console, seems like something that should have been done sooner probably?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's sad when PC games are developed with Console Kiddies in mind. When was the last time we had an AWESOME PC exclusive game? shit... we're lucky to get the scraps of the shitty games that they release for consoles, then port to PC just to try to make a few extra bucks off of Steam/Origin/Whatever</div></div><hr />

I played diablo on release and never touched it again and i think it was a decent game, but the point this guy makes in that thread actually does make some sense<br />
<br />
Not surprised by that. Battle.net 2.0 is pretty much made for consoles. Auto join, lack of chat/social features, no named host games. Yep. At least the botting won't be as bad. Well if you really want to bot that means you better have a lot of PS3/4s rofl.</div></div><hr />

Yea, because Diablo 3 isn't doing better than WoW at all... And also, this isn't the first time Blizzard has brought a game to console... Diablo was released on the original playstation many years ago.<br />
<br />
Just google Diablo original playstation and look at the wiki page.<br />
<br />
Starcraft 64 :D it wasnt too bad LOLOLOL<br />

Now the big question is; can you play with other people who's playing the PC version, and can you access your PC characters on your PS4 and vice-versa?<br />

Also, the game got so bashed everywhere... Even if it is in a better place now, I don't think it will be such a hit in consoles.<br />
<br />
But this also means that more consoles based games may be coming... So this can be good.<br />

A vendor that sells random unidentified gear is good enough, loot should be exciting. I agree with RMAH, and the AH in general remove it from the game and make loot drops exciting again. Path of Exile is everything D3 should have been and it's free. With the console adaptation they have a chance to fix the stupid AH/loot drop rate related design decisions that killed D3. If they do it could be awesome, if it is a rehash blech.</div></div><hr />

different markets, a lot of console players play console because they don't havea good enough pc or they just find consoles more fun. i knew a few people who dont like pc gaming because they dont want to sit at a desk to play, much better laying back on the sofa or in bed.</div></div><hr />

not that big for sony, Blizzard is a 3ed party to them, im willing to bet it will be comming to the nextbox and wii U aswell.. if thats the case i think the wii U would have the best version (on console). i dont know if anyone has played around with it, but that touch screen makes for awesome menus and management.</div></div><hr />

What are even talking about? You pay for the right to collaborate with the developers on the creation of a new custom item that when finished goes into the game and drops just like any other item. You aren't even paying for an item, you are paying to collaborate with the developers. They are on the record as saying they are basically only having a shop so you can donate to them if you feel you want to and nothing in there is really useful in any way shape or form in the game. Your attempt to compare it to D3s cash grab is laughable.</div></div><hr />

There will always be hate for everything in this world. Some people have nothing better to do than to whine about a game. If you enjoy it, that's all that matters. People say WoW sucks now, but I've played since BC and find it just as fun as ever. Do I care what people think? Course not. I enjoy it, so I will play it and the hell with what others think. :)</div></div><hr />

The Phantasy Star Online series has been doing this for a while now, and their most recent game PSO2 is on pc and soon to be vita (possibly ps3/ps4 later). <br />
This kind of cross platform online gaming has been around for a long long time, its just very seldom used because of exclusives. Its rather hard to get every company to work together for network architecture, when all they do is spout out about their own platform.<br />
<br />
Besides that though, nobody was / should have been shocked about the ps3/ps4 port for D3. We all saw the changes to the game in beta from a pc game to a setup that they could port to consoles. Its also not like they haven't ported things before; the original Diablo and Starcraft come to mind (minus the online aspect) .<br />
<br />
If anything, I'm really curious about why they changed the ui all over again ( I didnt realize they could make it look even worse, imo ), and if they plan on adding gamepad support for the pc version.</div></div><hr />

Stop whining. D3 isn't that bad now. It has come a long way.<br />

That's irrelevant. The game will not die. It still has big crowd of followers. Most D3 haters are WoW annual pass holders that dug their nose into something they knew nothing about.<br />
<br />
If only it was the annual pass holders.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's more active,and alive now more than ever..'<br />
<br />
I number of people playing it, forums, etc seems to disagree.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where as games like BF3 and Skyrim and now D3 were made for the PC and ported to the console. <br />
<br />
Skyrim was not made for PC first....<br />

You realize Blizzard has been hacked correct? Curse as well. (Which is part of the MMO-C Website family)... so if you're worried about the PS3 being hacked then you may not want to use a Blizzard product or a Curse related product ever again.... you know, just saying.<br />
<br />
@The topic: This isn't too bad to be released on PS3. I really don't think there are any other games of this genre on the PS3, so I can't help but to think they'll see slight profit out of this.</div></div><hr />

It's as if people think everyone who tried D2 became long-term players.<br />
Newsflash, D2 lost most if it's players too as the years went, and those who liked it stayed.<br />
<br />
D3 will also get a loyal fanbase, just like D2, and last a long time. Perhaps not as long, since there's so many ARPG games nowadays.</div></div><hr />

I usually dont wade into the stupid argument about people and their immense over-expectations for Diablo 3, but how is the RMAH pay to win? People throw around that epithet without actually knowing what it means a good portion of the time.<br />

<br />
Sounds fairly normal for any non-MMO. It's very rare I'm still playing any game regularly more than a couple of months after I buy it. Let's see -- Max Payne 3 was another AAA title released at the same time, so seems a reasonable comparison. Diablo III currently has 9324 hours/day according to XFire (since I know all the Blizzard haters consider that a great source of knowledge). Max Payne 3 has, erm, 106 hours/day. Yep, I'd say Diablo III is looking pretty healthy comparatively.<br />
<br />
(For people preferring to compare games of the same genre rather than same release day I suppose we'd have to look at Torchlight II -- obviously a more recent release, and cheaper, so it's bound to be at least a little higher than Diablo III, but how much of a lead does it have? 246 hours/day to Diablo III's 9324. Yeah...)</div></div><hr />

For some reason the next gen consoles have a hard on for online status and such, so it wouldn't surprise me.<br />

<br />
An item can be generally disliked, but still make good margins-Call of Duty and Beiber come to mind.<br />
A company with a wide enough reach can easily make a profit with decent margins, even if it is unpopular. That guy in vegas advocating sports gambling despite the lower % per dollar comes to mind. <br />
<br />
The old Xfire chart, while not perfect(lack of other resources, if anyone else has examples of D3 population feel free to show me), paints a story<br />

What? The point was that the population did die quickly, that in many regards it was a flop.<br />
It was a game with major issues, and it was pretty obvious they were winging it the entire time. Not surprising considering it was a whole other team, oriented around strategy games originally.<br />
<br />
The funny part was I saw a resurgence regarding D2 after a bit. Keep in mind this last bit is anecdotal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a updated Diablo 2 thats what most people wanted in Diablo 3 (An was over hyped by Blizzard) but didn't get. So to many Diablo 2 fans who waited 12+ years for there sequel it feels like a &quot;jesus game&quot; to others it may not.<br />
<br />
I like Path of Exile over D3 for one specific reason in a Arpg you're supposed to go out and farm gear, that is what the whole game is based around. In Path of Exile i can do this, in Diablo 3 to this day, i still feel like im grinding for gold to spend on the AH. It has nothing to do with drop rates and everything to do with the difference between the two games itemization and crafting system's.<br />
<br />
This is just my opinion but, the way Path of Exile lets you customize and level everything takes away some of that &quot;grindy&quot; feel and even if you dont find or craft a upgrade you still feel like you made progress.<br />
D3's paragon system is a good start in this kind of direction. I would like to see more of that type of additions and less &quot;we buffed drop rates!&quot; cause in the end no drop rate buff will help a crappy itemization system.</div></div><hr />

My bank thinks that way, wanted to get the Planetside 2 package, and my bank refused any transfers between my Master Card and Sony :), I called them and I would have to go there and sign some papers that I allow my card to be used to buy anything regarding Sony, couldn't be arsed - so Sony is still banned on my Master Card, funny thing is I tried with American Express and the same result. <br />

PoE might be no bright jewel on the history of Video Games, but yes, it's a &quot;Jesus Game&quot; in that context, and I believe it's impossible to successfully contest that.<br />
<br />
And why release this on consoles? RMAH isn't working on PC anymore, and they want to broad the market? I predict history will repeat itself.<br />
<br />
The only thing I believe that can save this fiasco is if they reveal on PAX that Always Online DRM is not present on PS version, and the game can run offline, signaling it coming to PC.</div></div><hr />

The only way I see anyone buying it is if you can play the same account/characters on both PC and PS3/4, other than that, I'm not sure what the point is. It makes sense to work on a console version of a game before the game was out, but if you're going to do that, then you should have it come out around the same time as the PC version, not a year+ later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are right, we can't compare D2's following to D3's. <br />
<br />
D2 was a game made for D1 fans.<br />
<br />
D3 was a casual little game designed to be played by everyone and their grandma, for the specific purpose of making big bucks for Blizzard. The astronomical initial sales and following plummeting of the playerbase prove this.</div></div><hr />

Its fine if you do not want to look for it and live in your own lie. Another poster linked the concurrent user charts from xfire and steam in this thread, but people like you will dismiss it anyways.<br />
<br />
The game is dead, you may be one of the few that enjoy the game, but compared to every other Diablo game, this game died in mere months. There are no &quot;haters&quot; and people sound like little school children when they say that. There are realists, and people who continually dismiss evidence are not realists.<br />
<br />
Right now, there have only been 9k games last month, it seems that the playerbase is even lower than 20k, lower than 10k even. More people play Neopets than D3 currently.</div></div><hr />

The 20 years that took Tyrael to recompose himself, and the secret search for the black soulstone Adria was in. Took them 20 years to advance nothing on than, and then suddenly Tyrael is thrown to the ground and Adria finally reach the stone in a small group after few days, even if she had one entire cult working for her for years, beforehand.<br />
<br />
Leah, the Death of Cain, the change of nature of Tyrael, the change of Balance between forces inside Heaven and Hell, and the unresolved issue with the Prime and Lesser Evils inside the lost Black Soulstone, while Adria run free, and the heroes embrace their Nephalem heritage, are all things that I'm dying to keep playing.<br />
<br />
But the system they embedded it into is unbearable. Status ENTIRELY DEPENDENT of gear, and gear in a randomization system that make it USELESS 99,99% of the time, and I mean USELESS, because your characters can't survive with anything less than the optimal sets, that fall 0,01% of the time. <br />
<br />
Again, they aren't even poor gear, It's USELESS. It's the OPPOSITE of Video-games 101, in which the greater the challenge, the greater have to be reward. Jay made the greater efforts be PUNISHED the harder. Way to go.<br />
<br />
Offline Mode could keep the interest a little more because you could have a Jamella Editor save with this optimal gear, allowing you to experiment the game with a fitting character, so every time you feel frustrated with Battle.Net, you would try a true play with a properly status-set character in offline at your own PC, until you feel the desire to repeat that online, WITH A LADDER.<br />
<br />
BUT NOOOOOOOO, Jay Wilson had to cash on the absolute frustration to FORCE the players to spend on RMAH. Well he successfully FORCED the players. OUT of the game.</div></div><hr />

Also, how will offline single-player's items will be balanced? Finding a suitable upgrade through drops alone is an incredible pain, will they take that into consideration since offline won't have an auction house? Secondly, will your battle.net account be used for the PS version or will you have to create an entirely new account? <br />
Another thing, when an expansion does come out, will they give simultaneous releases for the PC and PS3/4? <br />
<br />
So many questions, yet I'm still pretty intrigued. Seeing Diablo 3 in a different setting in my house may be refreshing. Nothing bad about playing it on a 55-inch TV, right?</div></div><hr />

I was no hardcore fan like many others because i prefer proper RPGs over Hack'n'Slays but I was playing it for quite a while (still remember the bad lags around christmas time, pings of 20k+). I got bored with D3 after a few weeks and even with the changes its uninteresting for me. Personally I miss the hubs were you could talk to ppl, make new friends and I like neither normal AH nor RMAH. Like someone stated before, it feels like farming gold for the AH, not for better items.<br />
Since i planned playing something like Diablo with my GF i had 2 choices. Buying another D3 for her or to get 2x Torchlight II. Of cause i went with the second choice. <br />

About Sony being hacked: Them being hacked isn't the problem, it's about user informations being stored in plaintext. No wonder people don't trust them anymore. In court it would be called &quot;grossly negligent&quot;...</div></div><hr />

When people say that only a few thousand ppl remain playing D3 the fanboys cry for prove but the ones making such statements never prove anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
You dont need to bash others if you dont like their opinion.....A lot of people are playing Diablo still and no one has to prove anything to you. <br />
Ive been playing hardcore since release.. and i still do play.<br />
~~<br />
About coming to ps3, its awesome news, the coop is where its at, and thats always more fun on console, will definitely play it! ;D</div></div><hr />

You mean the 'Xfire charts' they keep posting? I took a quick look, and they've got like 20-30 thousand people showing up on other titles like WoW, Skyrim, TF2 and more. I wouldn't necessarily call that 'proof' since I'm 100% sure those numbers aren't accurate. It's been a while since I used Xfire, but I'm assuming that's a log from people that have it installed and on, which the vast majority of gamers, for any game, don't. Also, it's logging most gamers on at one time, not 'userbase' in general. <br />
<br />
I can't verify the 'height' of the population numbers for D3, I'm not certain where to even look for that myself. Maybe someone else here knows a good source. I can however confirm that the X-fire numbers are not the best thing to use to support the 'No one is playing D3' argument.<br />

If D4 was released in several months from now, it would sell at a fraction at what D3 did.<br />
<br />
&quot;It sold well because of&quot; because you are the authority on sales figures amiright?<br />
<br />
You have no idea why it sold well. I never even played Diablo 2, I was a fan of Diablo 1 and that is why I bought it. I found the game to be great - and still play it now with friends. <br />
<br />
Just because some people - no matter how vocal - do not like it, does not mean you can throw around your opinion like fact. <br />
<br />
I disagree with your opinion.</div></div><hr />

As for Diablo 3, it was a terrible game on the PC alright. I'll be a good person and try to tell the console people to not ever touch that game</div></div><hr />

I know I shouldn't stoke the furnace as you seem to have an impassioned hatred of Diablo 3 but I wonder whether or not you hate the type of game Diablo is or Diablo itself. If you hate Diablo 3 and believe it to be a terrible game why is this? Because I have played all current/modern and old action RPG's and find Diablo 3 to be par and above the others out there. Par because there is only personal preference that is between them all, and above because it is my preference being art direction, story and gameplay being more appealing to my time and desires. I see no technical reason why Diablo 3 should be &quot;terrible&quot; unless you hate the type of game.<br />
<br />
Regarding Metzen - he is one of the principle lore developers, however it is known that his favourite character is Malfurion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I honestly think all people who would like to play D3 are already playing/already played and stopped. Maybe there are some people exclusive to consoles that might buy this, but nowadays, I don't think a person who really likes games would stick to only one platform, specially considering pretty much everyone has a PC, so PC games are much more readilly accessible.<br />
<br />
I am more interested on what Blizzard has planned next. I am pretty sure D3 is just the first step to a much larger plan of Blizzard launching console games in a regular basis. On that I am excited!</div></div><hr />

<br />
For one, it wasn't overhyped by Blizzard. It was overhyped by people who misremember Diablo 2 and how AMAZING things were. There's no doubt the game was awesome, but when people talk about things like the story or how loot was handled, they completely ignore how Diablo 2 actually was in favor of a romanticized version.<br />
<br />
Diablo 3 on release was pretty bad, but they've fixed a lot of problems. I still don't play it, but I'm big enough of a person to admit that the game is a lot better than when I was first jaded by its mediocre release. I don't hold onto a grudge based on an entirely unrealistic expectation that players put on the game and then throwing an utter shitfit when it wasn't 100% what THEY wanted.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like Path of Exile over D3 for one specific reason in a Arpg you're supposed to go out and farm gear<br />
<br />
Where does this happen in Path of Exile? I'm playing it right now and its just &quot;Get Gemcutter Prisms&quot; and trade them for what you want. As a matter of fact, when did &quot;farming gear&quot; ever happen even in Diablo 2? It didn't. You ran bots to get specific gem drops (Or SoJs back in the earlier days) to trade for other stuff. You never farmed for gear drops because it was impractical based on how item stat rolling worked.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is just my opinion but, the way Path of Exile lets you customize and level everything takes away some of that &quot;grindy&quot; feel and even if you dont find or craft a upgrade you still feel like you made progress.<br />
<br />
I don't mind Path of Exile, but pretending that it isn't grindy is pretty amazing. Its easily as grindy as Diablo 2, and then there's the fact that if you screw up your skill tree, you either have to start ALL over again, or waste a bunch of time grinding for Orbs of Regret.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been doing quite well with MP 10 without using the RMAH and spending ridiculous amounts of time playing the game. Over the years you develop a good network of friends that look out for each other and we all play WoW/D3/other games and have fun. There's a lot of trading between us for the amount of items we find in D3.<br />
<br />
Don't be bitter because everything in life isn't how YOU want it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's definitely a very grindy game, but I know what he means. For me I feel like its because I can actually get something that will improve my character. Multiple times I've found upgrades at end game in PoE. I've played D3 for a lot longer than I have PoE and I can safely say that I never found anything that I could use. Everything came from the AH. Maybe I'm just lucky/unlucky, but when I grind in PoE I feel like I might be rewarded, and when I grind in D3 I feel like I shouldn't even bother picking up the rares because I'm not going to get anything even worth selling. Maybe I'm just pessimistic when it comes to D3 :P.</div></div><hr />

You'd be surprised. An example of how many people own consoles that don't own PCs is Skyrim. It sold the most on the 360, even though the PC version is considered the 'best' and has modding capability. There are plenty of people who have 'so-so' pcs and plenty of people who simply don't like to deal with all the complexities of PC(I know quite a few people who just like the 'put in and play' factor of a console, whereas sometimes in the PC gaming world, there's incompatibility issues with software, hardware, and more). I've seen this a lot with plenty of games(take a cruise through sites like VGchartz and compare for yourself).</div></div><hr />
