<br />
Grommloc, great. Skipping the purchase, so very tired of murlocs. But hey, I should try to do something besides complain all the time. So what *would* have made a cool pet instead? <br />
<br />
1. A small demon from the burning legion, with a flavor text asking you whether you're out of your mind letting it hang around. <br />
<br />
2. A tiny Gromm - not a gd murloc, just a Gromm. Text saying something about it being a baby or don't tell it that it's small or something.<br />
<br />
3. A Skeksis oops I mean Arakoa. Flavor text talks about a crystal that is dim. <br />
<br />
4. Since it was the (original) expansion that introduced them, a tiny pet-version of the flying machine. Flavor text something something choppa gets to you.<br />
<br />
5. Anything related to Garrisons.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that's why we're bitching - what started out as a cutsey idea has ensured I hate all the new 'buy this, get that' stuff they come out with. <br />

Luckily for us, you don't get to decide what's a good or bad tradition. I like murlocs and I enjoy collecting these pets.</div></div><hr />

Yep, you also get CRZ and no flying in current content ever again. (Mark my words, their bs about 'we might change it if there's overwhelming'... is just that: BS) <br />
<br />
Lucky us! <br />
<br />
Pro tip: Try not to gloat quite so hard when people are disappointed by something, and maybe what's gone around on them won't come back around quite so hard on you the next time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll consider it depending on what the Hero's of the Storm in-game item is, as well as what the pet looks like.<br />
<br />
If it's a Murloc holding a tiny Gorehowl over it's shoulder, and uses it in battle, I'm sold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is reasonable to say &quot;i don't mind murlocs but i would also enjoy something else&quot;. It is completely unreasonable to be disappointed by a free pet, especially since it IS a blizzcon tradition and should be neither a surprise or a disappointment since they did not indicate it would be anything other than that. <br />
<br />
Try eating your own dog food and not being such a wet blanket when other people are having fun.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy At Midnight and the nerdist podcast a lot but still sad to see that Jay wont be there. I thought he always did a nice job, particularly in the last few years as he's gotten a hang of the culture and such. It's a long long way from the night he performed at blizzcon as part of the final evening and basically got booed off stage making a joke about why qwerty keyboards were dumb and how they should just be alphabetic. <br />
<br />
Of course that was the same bunch of assholes who were heckling Tommy Tallarico from VGL so rough croud indeed. Still makes me mad thinking about what a bunch of jerks people were being.</div></div><hr />

Of course that was the same bunch of assholes who were heckling Tommy Tallarico from VGL so rough croud indeed. Still makes me mad thinking about what a bunch of jerks people were being.<br />
<br />
I know! I'm not kidding when I say Blizzcon endeared me to Jay Mohr. Before that I really didn't know him or think he was funny based on the limited TV exposure I had to him, but again, it just worked somehow.</div></div><hr />

IOW it's a bad tradition.<br />

Then don't buy the tickets. Simple as that. Although I cannot fathom how someone would pay that price ONLY to get the pet, and not to enjoy the show as well. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I love the murloc pets. They are unique at that.</div></div><hr />

Yep, totally won't be buying the tickets. Also compare Murkablo and whatever the call the Deathwing one, notice that they have the same fire breathing animation, and reflect again on how unique they are.</div></div><hr />

Don't really care for HotS or hearthstone.<br />
DIII Addon will be too soon, to be detailed.<br />
<br />
All that remains would be Legacy of the Void, which I eagerly await.<br />
<br />
Meh, not paying 30€ for that.</div></div><hr />

Pro tip: Try not to gloat quite so hard when people are disappointed by something, and maybe what's gone around on them won't come back around quite so hard on you the next time.<br />

Well aren't you just a ray of self-righteous sunshine.<br />

Will over 75% of the things talked about regarding content for the upcoming Xpac be removed, heavily revised, or just be simple, plain PR hyped BS as was the case with this past Blizzcon with the equally BS excuse of &quot;time&quot; given?</div></div><hr />

Same here. Tired of hearing all that crap blizzard more than likely has no intention of adding in the first place but it sounds so cool they talk about it anyway.<br />
<br />
Way to much PR BS hype for features blizzard most likely knows wont be there.<br />
<br />
<br />

Only if they send me through iraq first.</div></div><hr />

Half the shit they talk about won't even happen. Yeah, I think I'll take a look at it after its over on youtube for free rather then shelling out 40 bucks again.
