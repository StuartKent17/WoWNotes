Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/08/15/diablo-iii-is-coming-to-the-nintendo-switch-in-2018-with-exclusive-content/) appears to have accidentally published an article about Diablo III coming to the Switch too early. Kotaku (https://kotaku.com/diablo-iii-is-coming-to-switch-later-this-year-1828367234) has confirmed this information. <br />
'Diablo III' Is Coming To The Nintendo Switch In 2018 With Exclusive Content<br />
Diablo III is making its way to the Nintendo Switch at long last.<br />
<br />
The action-RPG from Blizzard, which launched on PC way back in 2012 and subsequently released on consoles, will launch later this year. The Switch version, called the 'Eternal Collection' includes the Reaper of Souls and Rise of the Necromancer expansions plus all the other added content the game has seen and costs $59.99.<br />
<br />
Diablo III on the Nintendo Switch will also feature special Nintendo exclusive in-game bonuses: the Legend of Ganondorf cosmetic armor set, Tri-Force portrait frame, Chicken pet, and Echoes of the Mask cosmetic wings.<br />
<br />
Here’s The Legend of Zelda’s Ganondorf as the Barbarian in Diablo III:<br />
<br />
And here he is as the Crusader:<br />
<br />
The Nintendo Switch version of the game can be played in several different ways, including docked or on-the-go.<br />
<br />
Up to 4 players can play together on a single Switch.<br />
Up to 4 players can play on 4 different Switch units wirelessly without an internet connection.<br />
Players can also team up online with the Nintendo Switch Online service (which launches in September.)<br />
<br />
<br />
There will be cloud saving support for the game as well.</div></div><hr />

I bet they hired that new lead and all those devs just for a port to switch! <br />
<br />
Yup, sure did.<br />
<br />
obviously.<br />
<br />
<br />
...not<br />
<br />
Like, a port to switch would require a small team more than likely, if even that. And they said multiple un-announced projects, a port isn't an unannounced project, and even if it is, theres still -multiple-, meaning more than 1.<br />
<br />
If this is one of them, it just means that theres still another one that will prob be revealed at blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

Its a console by nintendo. Horrible specs but nintendrone says «its the most powerful tablet on the market». Who the hell plays on a tablet to begin with? And portability. You kinda look like a moron if you walk around with it</div></div><hr />

While that will increase customers, which will go on and increase funding for the next project, this is bad news overall for Diablo as a franchise. There will come a time in the next decade when Diablo III will feel more adult, more grotesque, more horror than what is to come next. You can go ahead and rest assured that Diablo IV will and should be a hard pass from most people who played since one, or can play PoE instead.</div></div><hr />

Never played Switch obviously. It's a great console for games like D3 or things that rely more on gameplay than on graphics. This will be a huge seller for Blizzard.<br />

<br />
They. Are.<br />
<br />
They outright said multiple projects and some will take longer than others. And that we will hear about some of those ones later this year (ie: BlizzCon).<br />
<br />
I GUARANTEE this is not one of those &quot;longer than others&quot; projects, this was one of the smaller ones, and has been in the works for some time (remember the tease with the light switch?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What the Switch has going for it - is price. For what it is, seems to be very well priced.<br />
<br />
Current iPhone is also about $1,000 and the Switch is under $300.<br />
<br />
Also doubt the iPhone really can play them as well, while the Switch has a Tegra CPU (AKA: mobile processor) it has a leg up on a phone due to having dedicated graphics with nVidia chip sets, more RAM than the iPhone, Dedicated VRAM for graphics.<br />
<br />
For gaming it'll outperform any phone on the market due to that dedicated vRAM and GPU.<br />
<br />
To make it easier to understand to someone who hasn't used a console in a while, as you claim:<br />
<br />
It is somewhere between a PS3 and a base model PS4 in terms of power. The WiiU was about 20% more powerful than the PS3 was if you looked at it's specs (it was just a nightmare to develop for...hence lack of support) and the Switch is 20% stronger than THAT. So it's below the base model PS4 but DEFINITELY above the PS3 by a noticeable amount.<br />
<br />
XBO-X and PS4PRO destroy it in power but that's not really what the Switch was aimed at. It was aimed at a market who wanted flexibility on where and how they play. It found it's own perfect little niche and fills it perfectly. Nintendo wants to play ALONG with others, rather than directly compete.<br />
<br />
Now if only they could figure out what others did nearly 15 years ago: How to do online properly.</div></div><hr />

They outright said multiple projects and some will take longer than others. And that we will hear about some of those ones later this year (ie: BlizzCon).<br />
<br />
I GUARANTEE this is not one of those &quot;longer than others&quot; projects, this was one of the smaller ones, and has been in the works for some time (remember the tease with the light switch?)<br />
<br />
They have &quot;multiple Diablo projects&quot; in the works. <br />
<br />
There is NO evidence that a Diablo 4 is coming. All signs so far point to mobile and ports.</div></div><hr />

To be fair Overwatch wouldn't be so bad. Would probably be locked to 30 FPS.<br />

Hearthstone as I said in the Switch megathread. That would be a perfect game for Nintendo Switch.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't talking about just D3. D3 is old and last generation. I was talking about just in general. But in GENERAL the Switch is a better gaming machine than the iPhone because it was designed for gaming. iPhone isn't a slouch (for about $1000 it damn well better not be), but the Switch will edge it out for gaming.</div></div><hr />

It's more that the Switch has a potentially decent sized install base.<br />

Diablo is finally getting a little bit of love from Blizzard and this is clearly the first part of their reinvestment in the franchise. Plus Diablo 3 on the switch has been a heavily requested port for over a year now and its coming with some fun new little cosmetics. <br />

My big question is how will the offline play work? I mostly play my switch portable mode on lunch breaks or road trips. Won't be able to connect to battle.net during those times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last I checked DX11 is a proprietary Windows API, meaning that their big unannounced Diablo project is targetting PC.<br />
<br />
https://careers.blizzard.com/en-us/openings<br />
<br />
They're also hiring plenty of artists and software engineers for the unannounced Diablo project which suggests it's not just a port, as they're creating completely new assets.<br />
<br />
None of the job listings for their new unannounced mobile project mention Diablo, so there's no real reason to assume it's a Diablo game at all right now, and whatever their mobile project is almost certainly isn't just a simple port of an old Diablo game because they're hiring quest writers and artists to create 3D environments and character models for it.<br />
<br />
Whatever their big incubator projects are, they're clearly aimed at PC and next-gen consoles for those job listings, and it looks like they're specifically prototyping something with first and third person action, though again, this isn't the big unannounced Diablo project.</div></div><hr />

I think everyone who has wanted to play diablo 3 has by now played it to death on their platform of choice. I would have purchased it at a low cost for casual play, but I certainly as hell do not play it enough to warrant $60. Especially when you consider diablo 3 a dead game. It has not seen new content in a long time and has no planned future content.</div></div><hr />

It's like you're not even having the same fucking conversation.<br />
<br />
I said I HOPE it would BE an MMO. I can HOPE it is an MMO and know it won't be. There is no contradiction, but...........nice try. Actually no, that wasn't a nice try. You even did an 'inb4' as if you had a point at all to defend. ROFL.<br />
<br />
You're like some of the dumb bullies in my high school. They pick on people thinking on an entirely different level than them, and they think the people outsmarting them are stupid because they don't 'get' the put downs and the quips.</div></div><hr />

God, are you even an adult dude? Can you not even own up to your own mistake. What a joke, get out of here with this weak crap. Either be an adult and own up to a mistake or just leave with your childish self. What a laughing stock man.<br />
<br />
I like how you quote bullies when you are literally being one. I just want you to be an adult, you are all senstive in your feelings cause someone called you out on your bs.<br />
<br />
Edit: Actually, you are the bully dude. You are literally telling people to drink bleach. https://imgur.com/a/XhFsQgB something is very wrong with you kid. No wonder you have issues. Cant wait for your next emotionally fueld response, because we already know your ego is bruised little guy.</div></div><hr />
