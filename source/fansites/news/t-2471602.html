Patch 8.1.5 - Tides of Vengeance Content Update Notes<br />
Allied Races - Kul Tiran Humans and Zandalari Trolls Now Available<br />
Take the final steps to bring new comrades into your faction. Level 120 players who wish to create a Kul Tiran will need to reach Exalted with Proudmoore Admiralty and earn the achievements A Nation United and Tides of Vengeance. Those wanting to create a Zandalari character must be level 120, reach Exalted with Zandalari Empire and earn the Zandalar Forever! and Tides of Vengeance achievements. Once you complete the requirements, visit the Alliance embassy in Stormwind or Horde embassy in Orgrimmar to begin a quest chain to recruit these new Allied races.<br />
<br />
Kul Tiras was founded by fearless explorers who sailed uncharted waters in search of adventure. As a key member of the Alliance of Lordaeron, the Kul Tiran navy dominated the seas of Azeroth with its legendary fleet.<br />
<br />
The Zandalari are a proud people whose origins date back to the early days of Azeroth's history. Their fierce warriors ride dinosaurs into battle, and they possess one of the most formidable naval fleets in the known world.<br />
<br />
Leveling your new Kul Tiran or Zandalari from 20 to 110 will earn you a unique cosmetic Heritage Armor set. You’ll also unlock a new mount—the Kul Tiran Charger or Zandalari Direhorn—for your collection at character creation.<br />
<br />
New Quests<br />
Many new stories and adventures are now available across Azeroth.<br />
<br />
The War Campaign Continues<br />
Sylvanas’s latest scheme causes Baine Bloodhoof to seek out Jaina Proudmoore, far from prying eyes. Speak to Bluffwatcher Proudscar in Zuldazar or Halford Wyrmbane in Boralus to further your faction’s agenda in this time of strife.<br />
<br />
Tools of the Trade<br />
Embark on all new profession questlines for Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Enchanting, Engineering, Inscription, Jewelcrafting, Leatherworking, and Tailoring, each culminating in an epic reward. If you've reached level 150 in Kul Tiran or Zandalari professions, return to your main profession trainer(s) in Boralus and Zuldazar to get started.<br />
<br />
Magni Bronzebeard<br />
Seek out the Speaker and speak with him to seek the understanding you’ll need to address the fate of Azeroth. Level 120 players should heed Magni’s call to continue the story and earn an item-level increase to your Heart of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Hati<br />
All level 120 Hunters of Azeroth should speak to the Image of Mimiron located in Tradewinds Market in Boralus or the Great Bazaar in Zuldazar. You’ll discover more about Hati’s whereabouts and make a future with your spirited companion by your side once again.<br />

Brawler's Guild is Back<br />
There’s a murder mystery afoot, and you’re going to have to fight to find the answers. Available at level 120, this series of rowdy boss fights is open once again in Bizmo’s Brawlpub near the Deeprun Tram in Stormwind and Brawl’gar Arena in the Ring of Valor in Orgrimmar. Of course, Brawler’s Guild is accessible by invitation only, so if you’ve never been inside, you’ll need to acquire an invitation. Enemies of the opposite faction in Zandalar and Kul Tiras now drop invitations, and a new vendor named A. Shady occasionally has them for sale in Orgrimmar and Stormwind. Brawler’s Guild has new bosses, a new questline, new transmog gear to be won, and a new mount: Bruce! He’s a good boy.<br />
<br />
Wintergrasp is now an Epic Battleground<br />

<br />
<br />

Incandescent Sliver and Diamond-Laced Refracting Prism trinket buffs are now cleared consistently on encounter, arena, and battleground start.<br />
<br />
<br />
Developers' notes: It was not our intention that these items require extra preparation prior to a boss pull. The Diamond-Laced Refracting Prism’s effect was already cleared at the start of a rated PvP match, so this change makes them both consistent between PvP and non-PvP encounters. We have increased the effect of the Sliver by 6% and the Prism by 15% to offset this change in behavior.<br />
<br />
<br />

Ray of Hope now costs 3000 mana (was 0 mana).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlock<br />
<br />
Destruction<br />
<br />
Demon Armor now increases Armor by 150% (was 275%).<br />
<br />
<br />
During Battle for Azeroth Season 1, we identified that Warlocks were taking too much damage from physical sources during PvP. We remedied this by adding a new PvP talent, Demon Armor, which increased their physical mitigation to match characters wearing Plate Armor. As we've been monitoring Season 2, we feel that the armor increase caused Warlocks to become too tanky in the current meta. This change effectively brings their physical mitigation close to that of Mail Armor (about 36% at ilvl 415), when it was previously similar to Plate Armor (about 45% at ilvl 415).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />

Holy balls. Nice to see they waited until these &quot;rare&quot; mounts aren't even that rare anymore... Only took them about 3 years to fix it (and yet for some reason they are still giving all five group members the mount instead of just the one person who killed it).</div></div><hr />

Obviously this is not a response to that complaint. Anyone can see that.<br />
<br />
But confirming large expenditures is common in the game, so this deserves one too.</div></div><hr />

Imo stupid change, should've just left it alone. <br />
<br />
<br />
Several transportation portals in previous expansion content have been removed. Yeah...just yeah...Wasn't a fan of the shrine portals being removed randomly, not much of a fan of even more portals just being taken mid expac to &quot;MAKE THE WORLD FEEL LARGER!!!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I do think people should be upset, even if we should of saw it coming.</div></div><hr />

I don't think this is a bad thing, though - leveling gear doesn't hold much value and lasts only for a relatively short amount of time, so pretty much none of the issues people have with &quot;forging&quot; applies to it. If anything, this change will make leveling gear slightly less boring.</div></div><hr />

I don't think the issue is with UL being castable in GW so much as GW healing traits being op.</div></div><hr />
