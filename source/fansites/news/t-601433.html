Addon Highlight : XLoot<br />
The Illidan killshot by Forte (http://www.fortegaming.com) a few days ago flooded my mail with &quot;Hey, what's the loot addon ?&quot;. Well, it's XLoot, and I suppose it's time to talk about it. This will let you track all the items you or your party looted, by showing them on screen if you use the XLootMonitor addon as well. Of course, the main function of XLoot is to change the layout of the original loot frame to make it a lot more readable, and to let you link everything in chat without problem. <br />
<br />
As usual, you can download it by accessing the WoWace file list (http://files.wowace.com/) <br />

Forums fixed<br />
Bugs with the new forums are fixed, and they now fully work. This is the good time to remind you that if you register (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?action=register) on the site, you'll be able to track new comments and replies in forum with our marvelous &quot;new&quot; tag. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-06-27, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Huh ? It's labeled as 2007, and the number on the site shows that it was uploaded after the Illidan 2.1.0 wallpaper, do you know the old URL or something like that ?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faelyn</div><div class="date">2007-06-27, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you look at the wallpaper, it has a sign on it with '06', so I guess it's from 2006.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-06-27, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The artwork is from 2006, the wallpaper is labeled as 2007. ^^<br />
<br />
It wouldn't be the first time that Blizzard uses an &quot;old&quot; artwork to create a new wallpaper.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tomas</div><div class="date">2007-06-27, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was part of the TBC advertising on the site just before TBC was released.<br />
<br />
You had to answer a few questions in different areas of the minisite and it opened up another section where this wallpaper was available for download.<br />
<br />
I guess as that section is now gone they just made it generally available for everyone.</div></div><hr />

I love Xloot but i just have one problem. Everytime i loot something it pops up somewhere else, dont you know how to fix loot frame ? So it will pop up exactly on same place ?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-06-28, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmmmm, the monitor or the loot window ? The loot window should be anchored on your cursor, maybe there is a way to change it but the default setting is just below your cursor, did you check /xloot settings ? I think you can even use /xloot options</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silverhound</div><div class="date">2007-06-28, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx, solved</div></div><hr />
