The new &quot;Ask the Dev&quot; is out and it seems that the Abyssal Maw dungeon is officially cancelled/postponed for the moment. <br />
Welcome to the answers thread for our World of Warcraft &quot;Ask the Devs&quot; global Q&amp;A. These answers are in response to the round #8 questions, which can be seen here: http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2098312571<br />
<br />
Q: What happened with the Abyssal Maw dungeon that was supposed to come with Firelands? – Maryjanee (EU-EN), Espiritu (NA)<br />
<br />
A: Our initial plan for this raid tier was to have fewer bosses in Firelands and a small number of bosses in the Abyssal Maw. As we looked more closely at Firelands, though, we realized that it deserved more bosses. We also got excited about designing item art (and set bonuses!) that were very fiery in nature, and the Molten Front questing area was turning out to be really cool, so we ended up piling more resources into Firelands. That led to the decision to focus on one strong theme (fire), rather than a more diluted fire-and-water theme.<br />
<br />
The case for Abyssal Maw pitch was that we could reuse a lot of existing assets (the fights were to take place in a giant shelled demigod like Nespirah), and while we are willing to do that, we thought Abyssal Maw would just pale in comparison to the magnificence of the Firelands. So, we put all of our eggs into that one basket. We’ve decided for now that the Vashj’ir quest line along with the Throne of the Tides dungeon does a pretty good job of finishing the Neptulon story.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: A majority of the fights in T11 favored having little or no Melee DPS. Are there plans to fix this? – Merissa (NA), Espiritu (NA)<br />
<br />
A: We view this more of a class problem than an encounter problem. It used to be the case that casters really suffered whenever they had to move, which was the penalty they paid in order to make up for the fact that melee took a lot of extra damage. Nowadays, melee classes don’t really take that much extra damage, and we’ve also given casters a number of movement-oriented tools designed to keep their DPS from dropping as much as it used to when they are asked to shoot-and-scoot.<br />
<br />
Whenever there are situations in an encounter that encourage grouping, the ranged often move into melee (with the occasional exception for hunters), but melee never move to ranged. Any of the fights that punish clumping also tend to punish melee more. We recognize all of these problems, as do many players, but it’s challenging to address them quickly. For example, without compensation, casters would suffer a lot in PvP if their movement tools were suddenly stripped away.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, we don’t want to over-constrain encounter design, or worse, make it feel very formulaic by getting to the point where players expect the “melee fight” to be followed by the “adds fight,” followed by the “Patchwerk fight,” then the “ranged fight.” We’re making sure that melee have some fights where they can shine in Firelands. To use just one example, the Sons of Flame on Ragnaros tend to be better handled by melee than ranged.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: When Tier 11 content was first launched, the majority of fights in 25-person were explicitly easier than the 10-person version, such as Nefarian and almost every Heroic encounter. Do you have plans to make content for 25 players more appealing in patch 4.2? – Wynter (EU-DE), Nisana (EU-FR), Espiritu (NA)<br />
<br />
A: The supposition that easier content is less appealing in the question is a bit puzzling given how few guilds have been able to finish the heroic 25 encounters. In any event, it wasn’t that we set out to make sure 10s and 25s were different. If anything, we wanted to make sure that 25s weren’t significantly harder, since many of the 25-player guilds were convinced we were trying to force them to become 10-player raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
There were some fights at launch where 10s were too challenging (and some fights where the opposite was true), but we view those as nails in a board that need to be either beat down or pried up until they are more even with everything else. Progress in NA and EU on the 25-player content was faster than on the 10-player content, but this was probably largely because most progression oriented guilds in those regions were already focused on 25-player raids. This is also a regional difference. In Korea for example, there are a lot of hardcore raiding guilds focused on heroic 10-player content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will we see anything of a sympathetic view of why Fandral Staghelm changed allegiances before he meets his demise? – Lorinall (NA)<br />
<br />
A: Not every villain in World of Warcraft gets a chance at redemption. In Firelands, the new majordomo will show you no mercy, so we don’t recommend holding back. However, one of the final quest rewards available from the Leyara quest line in the Molten Front daily quest area will give you a chance to see another side of the former archdruid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: It can be anticipated that mana regeneration and maximum mana will increase from gearing up with the new Firelands equipment. Isn’t there a possibility that healers can spam big heals again (and more quick heals) just like in WotLK? If so, is there any plan to handle this without class nerfs? – Whitewnd (KR)<br />
<br />
A: As damage increases, healers will need to use their largest, most inefficient heals more regularly to keep up. That’s fine and was all part of the design. We just didn’t want players to opt out of mana regeneration too early in the content because then Spirit (and mana-related procs) on gear wouldn’t be attractive, and because we’d have to balance difficulty by making the tanks die in a couple of GCDs if not healed continually. Most progression-oriented healers still want large amounts of Spirit, often in every single slot. As they get more comfortable with their mana, they’ll be able to replace some of that Spirit with other stats, but the Spirit will still be valuable; more Spirit on a set piece for example might mean being able to use a different enchant or reforge on another piece.<br />
<br />
This is still a much better place to be than we were with Lich King content, where mana stopped mattering in the first raid tier. Aside from the mana changes we’ve already made to Innervate, Mana Tide Totem and paladin heals, we don’t think an overall regen nerf is necessary.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Do we have any plans to include events similar to the Wrath Gate? – Mushik (LA), 잔메르 (KR)<br />
<br />
A: We have a short cinematic or two, but nothing on the scale of the Wrath Gate cinematic for 4.2. We enjoy that kind of epic spectacle and we’ll do it when it makes sense; however, we also received plenty of feedback from the Cataclysm questing experience that we occasionally took control away from players too often, especially in Uldum, in order to tell the story, so we want to be very careful when we do that in the future. That said, there are some very cinematic moments in 4.2 such as watching the druid trees on the Molten Front grow or seeing the bridge form to Sulfuron Keep.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will there be weekly missions in the Firelands similar to Icecrown Citadel in where the players were required to alter the dynamics of each encounter in order to complete them and receive rewards such as promordial saronite and gold? – Orisai (LA)<br />
<br />
A: We aren’t doing these types of quests for the Firelands raid, but that doesn’t rule out us doing them again in some future tier of content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: In Cataclysm, it has been hard to find unique raid mounts such as Siege Engines in Ulduar or Drakes in The Eye of Eternity. Can we expect to see battles using unique mounts or other objects among the Firelands raids? – 빛그***제 (KR)<br />
<br />
A: We were worried players might be suffering from a little bit of encounter vehicle fatigue. We’ll do it when it makes sense for an encounter, but we don’t want players to get sick of seeing fights on vehicles.<br />
<br />
There are several fight mechanics in Firelands that depart from usual “don’t stand in the fire” or ”interrupt important spells” routine. For example, you can fly during part of the Alysrazor encounter, you climb webs during the Beth’tilac encounter, and you steer Lord Rhyolith around in a manner very different from standard kiting. (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2219880)<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Is Ragnaros gonna have a speech about setbacks? – Gerox (NA)<br />
<br />
A: TOO SOON, GEROX!<br />
<br />

Hotfix: Battleground Multi-Queuing<br />
We recently implemented a hotfix that removes the ability for players to retain a second Battleground queue when one pops. Previously, players were able to queue for two Battlegrounds, have one queue pop and retain their second queue while they decided if they wanted to join the one that was ready. This is no longer the case. When a Battleground queue pops you will automatically be removed from the other active queue. To queue for a different Battleground it will be necessary to queue again.</div></div><hr />

So true, I certainly don't understand how they can see as Neptulon simply being dragged away a good 'finishing'.</div></div><hr />

Did they forget how Throne of the Tides ends? Ozumat kidnaps Neptulon and swims away, strongly hinting that both Ozumat and Neptulon will be raid bosses in the future.</div></div><hr />

They also make mention that they notice it is a problem, but don't mention that they are fixing it. Instead they go &quot;yeah but this fight has ADDS FOR YOU TO KILL! YAAAAY!!!&quot;<br />

<br />
This.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is probably one of the most straightforward/frank game companies about their production times and their intents. The problem with their honesty and their willingness to express things they hope to include/work on in the future is that it causes rampant, rabid fan entitlement whenever they decide to scrap a smaller project to amp up quality on more important things, like a whole raid teir.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wah, Blizzard is LAZY AND HATES US because they decided to produce one piece of FINISHED CONTENT than two pieces of mediocre content!&quot;<br />
<br />
Besides, people who are pining for more 5-mans can just do the Teir 11 content during 4.2. All that stuff is getting so completely nerfed that you can probably roll into those dungeons wearing greens from Twilight Highlands, and 2 hours of killing T11 bosses will give you more points than 2 hours of doing heroics anyday.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">creepygnome</div><div class="date">2011-05-25, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know why I bother to read the Dev's Q &amp; A anymore. It just always makes Blizz sound lazy, or uninterested in their own game. And maybe they are, and that is why the content is going the way it is. I guess for those of us that have played for 6+ years, and the game is getting boring, it might just be the same way for the people who have been working on it for probably 7-8+ years. They might want to move onto something new too. <br />

A: Not every villain in World of Warcraft gets a chance at redemption. In Firelands, the new majordomo will show you no mercy, so we don’t recommend holding back.

Blizzard is probably one of the most straightforward/frank game companies about their production times and their intents. The problem with their honesty and their willingness to express things they hope to include/work on in the future is that it causes rampant, rabid fan entitlement whenever they decide to scrap a smaller project to amp up quality on more important things, like a whole raid teir.<br />

<br />
THANK YOU! I'm not doing heroic modes, so maybe its different there, but my frost DK, besides taking some extra damage (which can still be mitigated every minute or so), has had no problems on these fights pulling decent dps. Out of all the fights I can think of on normal, only Ascendant Council's 2nd and 3rd phases, Chimaeron's Feud phase, and the first phase of the Nefarian fight (with Onyxia) are truly mean to melee dps. <br />
<br />
Also, raspberries to all the QQers about how Blizzard is ruining the game and how they are lazy and suck a certain organ. If Blizzard had a track record of not satisfying customers, they wouldn't have 11.4 million subscribers worldwide. Its as simple as that. The 600k that they reported quit in their annual report most likely could not adapt and overcome the challenges of Cataclysm. So, if the game is too hard for you or too easy for you, stop playing, or find a way so that it isn't.</div></div><hr />

Sad that they listened to all the lame whiners about Uldum. The cinematics there made the story feel epic and made it a great change of pace from prior content in WoW. The only real problem is that a bunch of them were buggy at release. The Schnottz's Landing storyline already suffers a lot from losing one of its major cinematics after release.<br />
<br />
I surely hope they don't give up on that style of storytelling just because a vocal minority complained about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Halfus 25 reg/hm: The clutter from the fire balls being rained down on can, bombard Melee, only way to avoid this is for tank to move boss, which within itself is annoying for all members of the party.<br />
<br />
Valiona/Theralion 25 reg/hm: Looking at reg its a decent fight for Melee and range. Range have to deal with placement of Twilight Portals, while Melee have a hard time dealing damage during Dazzling Destruction. But melee have to spread during first phase because of the meteor's, Which when you have 5-6 Melee its quiet painful.<br />
<br />
Twilight Council reg/hm: First phase, Constant switching if the dps split is not equal, and Ignacious charges off and we have about 3-4 sec of no damage. Also, its decently a challenge to give the proper fire/frost buffs, depending on how you place the raid/bosses during that fight. Second Phase, Lightning Conducter, having to run far distances for proper buffs to avoid death of earthquake/crackle like abilities. Third Phase, Pools, Embers, Lighting Chaining.<br />
<br />
Chogall reg/hm: Downtime with having to run to add spawned, and cluttering once again so watch out for that fire!<br />
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_<br />
Magmaw reg/hm: Probably the most Melee friendly fight currently. Stacking close to magmaw, and only having to switch between bone construct and Magmaw is pretty fun. +1 for melee.<br />
<br />
Omnitron reg/hm: Having to run away from Toxitron to avoid a fixate bomb, Means downtime. Lightning conductor + Clumped Melee = alot of damage going out.<br />

This 100 times over. The majority of those with this disposition have obviously never ever played any other MMO, and most certainly no pre-WoW MMO. Blizz gives more content more frequently for free than any other MMO ever has. There's a lot of other dev teams that would have just slapped in a short Deathwing encounter after the current tier and called it a completed xpac. Wrath-babies, BC-babies, Cata-babies - more like WOW-babies. Your monthly subscription only gives you access to current content, period. Anything added for free, yay, enjoy it, stop whining. I find it impossible to believe you have done absolutely everything the game has to offer.

And when I'm running with my warlock to avoid things or to hunt moving adds (e.g cho gall's adherents) I can throw Shadowbolts and Incinerates at the same time? Running or moving isn't downtime for me? Arcane and Fire mage have longer casts than warlocks. What about them? Doesn't it screw them when they have to move? ONLY thing that ranged are better than melee is the case of needing to switch to an add that spawns at a spot they already are in range with so they can just change target and keep dpsing. Again most classes have some ramp up or rotation issues that still causes them to lose dps while switching. Only case where SOME ranged (not all) have clear advantage is in fights with permanently more than 1 target to dps where they can gain much damage by multidoting (warlock, priest, moonkin / not mage, not hunter, not shaman). On the other hand of course there are cases where melees can cleave (when those more than 1 targets are close to each other and are not flying) so this can be wither favoring ranged or melee according to the fight [let's not forget Prince Council and phase 1 of Lich King where melees topped meters doing fake (cleaving 1hp inactive prince) or unnesacary (killing small ghouls) dmg..]. What melees are asking from bliz supports homogenization even more. And that's somthing I usualy see the community doing and makes me laugh (with the bad meaning). I mean... decide what you whine about? Homogenization is bad? Melee and ranged having advantages and disadvantages each one on different situations is bad? what is bad? noob kids are bad and nerfing raids too.<br />

He's 100% right. There's a subset of players who have nothing better than bitch about everthing Blizzard does or doesn't do. Almost every single whiner has serious entitlement issues, as if Blizzard needs pucker up and kiss their<br />
ass. And in almost every single case, it's a butthurt &quot;serious&quot; raider who's bitching. <br />
<br />
It's also not an MMO thread if there's not a lot of tears being shed.<br />

<br />
You don't just &quot;hire 25 people&quot; to develop gaming content, especially with the idea of getting content out fairly quickly. First, you need to hire developers with game development experience. Then you have to hire an artist or two do the artwork and graphics and then SQA people to test the new stuff. Pretty soon it's not &quot;25&quot; people but a whole other development team. A team which will probably have little work to do unless Blizzard wants another development team in house. <br />
<br />
A million to deliver one small set of raid bosses doesn't seem reasonable at all. Of course, spending other people's money is easy, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they really intend to hold off on finishing that storyline till the next expac then they shouldnt have bothered putting it into the game for the first tier of heroics. Starting a storyline and then leaving like they did for what will be 1 1/2 - 2yrs is a really stupid and shitty idea and bad decision on their part. As for those saying it will be used as a lead-in to a Queen Azshara raid blizz has already stated they won't be putting her in as a raid this expac cause they want to give her her own expac most likely the next one.</div></div><hr />

Previously, players were able to queue for two Battlegrounds, have one queue pop and retain their second queue while they decided if they wanted to join the one that was ready. This is no longer the case. When a Battleground queue pops you will automatically be removed from the other active queue. To queue for a different Battleground it will be necessary to queue again.<br />
<br />
This is truly awful. There is literally no reason to queue for more than one BG at a time now as the smaller BGs will ALWAYS pop faster than the large.</div></div><hr />

A: Our initial plan for this raid tier was to have fewer bosses in Firelands and a small number of bosses in the Abyssal Maw.

Way back when Cataclysm was first announced they were talking about all the cool new environments we'd see in the elemental planes, including the Abyssal Maw, and I'm pretty sure they mentioned how they were reinventing the way underwater combat works to accommodate for it. <br />
But by the time the expansion shipped, all we saw was one 5-man dungeon set there; no zone, no raid, not even &quot;mini-zones&quot; like the current Firelands in Hyjal. And the truly sad part is that dungeon is literally just an underwater-themed hallway with an extremely vague and unsatisfying ending. (Neptulon, the lord of water, is taken/killed/controlled right before our eyes yet the dungeon just ends there, and no mention of it or the events there is ever made again afterward)<br />
And then for the new 5-man there, which they won't even make now, they were just going to set it inside another Nespirah? I probably wouldn't care as much if they at least stuck it through and made it for us to experience, but...that would just not make any sense at all. Those giant shelled creatures, while cool (and never fully explained), are not part of the Abyssal Maw...they're just ancient sea creatures in Azeroth. It would be like setting the &quot;Firelands&quot; raid in that flaming forest in Howling Fjord...lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Second, about the water area that got scrapped, my own guess is that what sounded good in theory... did not pan out so well in practice. So on paper they had all these neat ideas that sounded like they would be fun, creative, and interesting. What they may have gotten when they put the pieces together was tedious and frustrating instead. After all, fighting underwater changes from 2D movement to 3D movement, and the difficulties of producing entertaining 3D battle may have been harder than they expected.<br />
<br />
I doubt if it has been scrapped for good. Just like Firelands not coming out at the same time as ZA and ZG did not mean Firelands did not happen, just that it will be done later. Hopefully not too much later!</div></div><hr />

<br />
They didn't backpedal on point 1. They already said that ZA/ZG was originally meant to be in with Firelands but they decided to put it out earlier.<br />
<br />
As for point 2 - yes Abyssal Maw will be the continuation of Throne of the Tides and probably will be when we actually see it. The only difference being is that they aren't putting it out &quot;now.&quot; Considering there's still a lot of unexplained lore involving the Naga and underwater areas of Azeroth it's a perfect thing for a future expansion centered around that lore.<br />
<br />
Things get moved back or pushed out early or canned completely because it sounds like a cool idea on paper but doesn't work when implemented - welcome to the world of Development in just about every entertainment medium. You may wish to get the stick out of your ass before proceeding.<br />

Promising content and not delivering it is not calculated to make anyone happy, no matter the reasoning. Also, their replies about melee unfriendly fights and Staghelm were either incredibly poorly worded or purposely avoiding the actual question. While WoW is currently the best MMO on the market for a variety of reasons, that doesn't mean it doesn't have flaws or the people managing it are incapable of bad decisions. Overall, I've found more issues with their recent decisions than I did earlier in the game's life.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vesker</div><div class="date">2011-05-26, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait so Firelands was originally going to be LESS than 7 bosses? And these 7 bosses are what they spent so many resources on? Seriously? That's kind of depressing to think about.<br />
<br />
What happened to 12/13 bosses being the average length of a raiding dungeon especially when that raiding dungeon is all you're going to have to do for months before the next content release? I can't be the only one getting kind of pissy about this. Ulduar was, in my opinion, the best bit of raiding in the game (both in aesthetics and mechanics) and it actually felt like a dungeon instead of just a big room surrounded by a few smaller rooms for bosses to hang out in. <br />
<br />
Blackwing Descent does not feel ominous, intimidating or epic in any way no matter how many dead dragons you hang from the ceiling. It just feels like Nefarian's basement.<br />
<br />
Throne of the Four Winds is...well five platforms in the sky with a voiceless Ragnaros reskin sitting up there. Not much to say there.<br />
<br />
Bastion of the Twilight is slightly better and actually feels like you're kicking down the enemy base's door and breaking everything between you and the end but 4 bosses is still kind of a pathetic length for a raid instance especially when these are the guys who've been terrorizing you for the entire expansion.<br />
<br />
If this is Blizzard's new attitude towards raiding I can't say I'm a fan and if it continues into future content I'll probably jump ship and unsub as many others have done recently. I can't, in good conscience, say that Blizzard don't care about the game anymore because the massive overhaul Cataclysm has applied to the game is all kinds of impressive but raiding hasn't gotten the same level of attention and it shows.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jiggles</div><div class="date">2011-05-26, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This 100 times over. The majority of those with this disposition have obviously never ever played any other MMO, and most certainly no pre-WoW MMO. Blizz gives more content more frequently for free than any other MMO ever has. There's a lot of other dev teams that would have just slapped in a short Deathwing encounter after the current tier and called it a completed xpac. Wrath-babies, BC-babies, Cata-babies - more like WOW-babies.That's the thing, though. WoW has attracted lots of players who didn't like other MMOs. If WoW didn't exist, then they wouldn't be playing an MMO.<br />
<br />
Let's face it: WoW is one of the few non-shit MMOs. The MMORPG was founded on a good idea: let's take those fun single-player RPGs and add vast multiplayer; a massive community where people can work together (or against each other) to complete quests. However, in translating that single-player RPG, they ran in to a number of glaring problems. Many of these problems, like quest design (How do you make the player's character feel important, when the quest has to be doable by millions of other players?), WoW handled better than other MMOs. <br />
<br />
By far the biggest problem for an MMO, however, is how to keep the player subscribed. The solution that most MMOs took was to simply make accomplishing anything take 100x longer than it should. That way, it would be a very long time before the player could get through all the content. And while MMOs were still new and exciting (see Everquest), this worked. But, as old MMOs aged, and new MMOs had the exact same boring treadmill, lots of players simply stopped playing. <br />
<br />
Then WoW came. It did what most Blizzard games do: take an existing genre and refine it into an even better game. It did so by building on the established Warcraft lore, having relatively bite-sized quests (that don't take eons to finish), relatively quick advancement, and well-designed (for the time) end-game content. This allowed Blizzard to attract a huge chunk of the MMO player market, and also to attract a great many players who, frankly, wouldn't be playing an MMO but-for WoW. That's why saying &quot;but other MMOs were worse&quot; sort of misses the point: yes, they were. That's why they suck (generally speaking) and have way fewer subscribers. Also, Blizzard's content generation engine is as good as it is today exactly because of how much money WoW makes them. Other less profitable MMORPGs simply can't compete.<br />
<br />
The problem WoW faces today, however, is that a large chunk of the player base has been playing for 6+ years, and the game is getting stale for them -- as much as Blizzard refined the MMORPG with WoW, it's still an MMORPG. Players still love the story and lore of WoW, but they're not so fond of wiping 50x to down a new boss. Or grinding yet another set of soon-to-be-meaningless faction reps. They don't want to quit because there are parts of WoW they love, but they also can't overlook the annoyances like they could when WoW was younger.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your monthly subscription only gives you access to current content, period. Anything added for free, yay, enjoy it, stop whining. I find it impossible to believe you have done absolutely everything the game has to offer. There's more content than can possibly be consumed by one player, whining about the lack of X or Y is just plain silly. Ultimately if you don't like it leave, we don't care.This doesn't make a whole lot of sense. One of the reasons WoW attracted so many players was that it tries its best to cater to a huge audience: bite-sized quests for those short on time, epic quests for those that love lore, crazy achievements for completists, 5 mans, 10 mans, 25 mans, battlegrounds, arenas, etc. That is a ton of content, but it doesn't appeal equally to all players. For example, I find the state of PvP in WoW to be a bit lackluster (in trying to appeal to everyone, Blizz has shoehorned a very PvE-centric RPG design into PvP) and neglected (how many new arenas and battlegrounds does Blizz release, compared to the number of 5-, 10-, 25-mans?). Also, I'm far from a completist. I remember the gaming days before Achievements, and I find other players' zeal to complete them to be...a bit baffling. <br />
<br />
Just because there are a lot of things to do in WoW doesn't mean those things are fun for a player. After all, the point of WoW is to have fun, right? As you said, &quot;if you don't like it leave.&quot; Which is what many players do: they consume a content patch until they get bored, then they suspend their accounts. While suspended, they check up on sites like MMO Champion, wondering why it's taking Blizzard so long to release new content that they care about. <br />
<br />
In the end, though, the malcontent players here aren't really what Blizzard has to worry about. With millions of players, a few hundred players complaining here is nothing. Plus, these players are still interested enough in WoW to follow its news. What Blizzard really has to worry about are the players who don't come here to complain: those that have quit and completely moved on.</div></div><hr />

If they really intend to hold off on finishing that storyline till the next expac then they shouldnt have bothered putting it into the game for the first tier of heroics. Starting a storyline and then leaving like they did for what will be 1 1/2 - 2yrs is a really stupid and shitty idea and bad decision on their part. As for those saying it will be used as a lead-in to a Queen Azshara raid blizz has already stated they won't be putti...<br />

Sorry, no. I'd rather have a heroic to run that doesn't complete a story than no heroic. I'm also guessing most people, or at least many people (like me for example) don't care about the story anyway.</div></div><hr />
