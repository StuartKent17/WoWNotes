<br />
Exactly why I don't watch Family Guy anymore. Was funny but man I saw that whole &quot;FAMILY GUY WoW THING&quot; all over WoW-based sites and it wasn't even a minute. Cute and worth the 45 seconds but not amazing enough to make me bother watching that felt so forced. Also super outdated (and staged!) meme and they didn't even have Cleveland go &quot;well at least I'm getting chicken after this&quot; or something.<br />
<br />
*shrug* Just think they could have done it better and Wowhead shouldn't have overhyped this short clip.</div></div><hr />

They could have done a really good episode with the family getting addicted and fighting both in game and IRL but instead we got the oldest wow joke in history and it wasn't even funny because the poor execution.</div></div><hr />

It kind of looks like the creators might have been forced to make a WoW reference, but I really have no idea.</div></div><hr />

The reference should've ended with &quot;are you familiar with a Leeroy Jenkins?&quot;, keeping it short and snappy and providing a &quot;ha!&quot; moment for viewers in the know, before promptly moving the scene on. Instead they dragged it out into a minute-long sequence that just replicates the thing they're referencing with no attempts to put a new spin on the idea or construct any jokes out of it. This is how you stretch two minutes of comedy writing into a twenty minute script.</div></div><hr />

But if this is something they felt worth hyping up I'd hate to see what kind of a train wreck the rest of the show is. 8-10 years ago this probably would have been a solid gag but now... it's like someone offering you a hamburger and just giving you two stale buns with nothing else.</div></div><hr />

because they could? also i dont think that artwork was done officialy by them, they literally said ahead of time that iwas just going to be a &quot;easter egg&quot; (cause easter) you have been able to read that the episode wasent a warcraft one since the day it was announced<br />

That was not at all what I was expecting. So much hype for about a minute of out-dated WoW reference stuck in the middle of something that has nothing to do with WoW (which is the norm for Family Guy, I guess). I expected a big part of the episode dedicated to the game, simply because there was a picture showing Stewie and Peter dressed as orcs from the WC movie. Talk about over-hyping...<br />

i did let out a small &quot;hah&quot; when they said &quot;aww dragons, these guys have magic guys&quot; but other then that is was &quot;meh&quot; sad Cleveland didnt mention chicken.<br />
I was suspecitng the leeroy thing but i didnt suspect for them to actuallty go full on the 3d models and all that, i just assumed he was about to run in yelling leeroy jenkins and that woudl be the end of it... nope, 3d, ui, dragon whelps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most people already knew it wouldn't be a full warcraft episode from the synopsis. And you do realize they committed to a whole Sherlock Holmes episode last week and have even done an episode of just Stewie and Brian in a bank vault for the whole episode before right? So they do fully commit to ideas when they feel like it. <br />
<br />
They hyped it just to april fools the people who didn't read what the episode was about and I guess techincally they fooled me too because I thought the warcraft part would have had the normal family guy art style.</div></div><hr />

I thought he just hated the show but was under contract or something. That's the reason I've heard for Family Guy being less funny-he just doesn't care any more and wanted to end it years ago.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frozen Death Knight</div><div class="date">2018-04-02, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Besides the fact that Family Guy is using a joke that has been done a ton over the years, which would not impress any WoW player at this point, Family Guy just simply failed at telling the joke, especially in regards to how it is set up. By having Cleveland ask the others about if they know what a &quot;Leeroy Jenkins&quot; is, the joke just simply falls flat on its face, since the entire point of pulling off a Leeroy is for the person to do it spontaneously and unexpectedly for the other team mates. Leeroy in the original video was AFK and unaware of the entire plan being discussed while he was busy grabbing chicken from his microwave, but Cleveland is just listening in on what the others are saying until he says the catchphrase, completely missing the point of why the joke was funny to begin with.<br />
<br />
Also, how you can advertise this as a &quot;WarCraft&quot; episode with a single reference from Vanilla WoW is ridiculous. People, just go and watch &quot;Make Love, Not WarCraft&quot; from South Park if you want a good episode about WoW, because this is a waste of time.﻿</div></div><hr />

I dunno, maybe this would have worked back during WoD when Leeroy was relevant again for a few months, but...I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, Family Guy &quot;jokes&quot; these days either seem to be the cast doing horrible hateful things to each other, or stuff that is just tired and flat and...not funny.<br />

Like others said, the whole episode wasn't going to be about WoW, just a reference or two. Morons of the internet are the ones saying the whole episode was all about WoW because of the BFA parody picture... Relax.

I think they just went with the reference the most people would at least remember. Fuck, these guys have always referenced shit from 10+ years ago(at the time of the episode airing). It's just the show has been on so long they're in the 2000's for some of these callback references now.</div></div><hr />
