Blizzard Trademarks &quot;Compete&quot;<br />
Blizzard appears to have trademarked &quot;Compete&quot; in the US and some EU countries. The description makes it clear that it isn't related to the WoW Expansion we are all waiting for, but instead an esports tool. <br />
<br />

Overwatch Added to the Launcher<br />
Overwatch was added to the launcher today. You can't actually install it, so it is just an advertisement for now.<br />

Patch 6.2.1 PTR - Build 20363<br />
Tonight's PTR build fixed a few things for mercenary mode and has been flagged as Release. We also learned that Patch 6.2.2 is coming (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/629076330546532352) in the future, so flying may be on the way soon!<br />

Strings Changes<br />
<br />
ERR_BATTLEGROUND_JOIN_MERCENARY - Cannot join as a group unless all the members of your party are flagged as a mercenary.<br />
WORLD_PVP_DESERTER - You cannot enter %s until your deserter debuff wears off.<br />

Patch 6.2 Hotfixes - August 5<br />
Garrison<br />
Followers<br />
<br />
Talonpriest Ishaal's Last Rites ability should now correctly be considered a stun effect. The effect lasts 3 seconds when used against other players, and shares diminishing returns with other stun effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
Hellfire Citadel<br />
Hellfire High Council<br />
<br />
Dia Darkwhisper's Mark of the Necromancer now deals 20% less damage. Additionally, applications of Mark of the Necromancer can no longer be delayed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Sanctus, Sigil of the Unbroken (http://www.wowdb.com/items/124637-sanctus-sigil-of-the-unbroken) on-use ability has been doubled in effectiveness and now grants 50% to Versatility (up from 25%) on the base ring.<br />

No one registered anything related to Glades or Prophet in France, where Blizzard EU is headquartered, and where they registered all their trademarks. While they can use the trick of having someone else register, then transfer the trademark once they reveal it, it's doubtful they'd take the risk of someone sniping them the trademark one day before the announce.</div></div><hr />

Well, I for one distinctly remember thinking during the ToT patch: &quot;this is perfect, my class feels perfect, I dread what Blizz might plan for the next xpac as change just for the sake of it.&quot;<br />
Wasn't fond of the 4+ faction dailies right at the start and the 14 months SoO at the end, but other than that: favourite xpac after WotLK.<br />

Should Blizzard introduce retro servers at one point in time I'd probably play on a WotLK and MoP one.</div></div><hr />

You misunderstood that one. Flying is on the 6.2.1 PTR and will be released with Merc mode. The fact that Blizzard is already talking about changes in 6.2.2 means that 6.2.1 will be released soon. I guess next week or the week after that if there are severe bugs that need to be fixed ASAP.</div></div><hr />

I really miss the old pvp, old dailies and to be honest the old character stats from WOTLK, but, again Blizzard mentality = &quot; Let's give them some big numbers, because we like big numbers(especially when it comes to money) and fload their screens with this kind of numbers!&quot;. And I think I'm not the only one that feels this way, the statistics show this kind of truth even better, they promise much before WoD release and that's why they reach again 10 mil subs, but this non-expansion was a disappointment even from the Q1, people couldn't wait more to see any improvements, they get us to from the previous 2 &quot;amazing&quot; expansions(atleast you can call them expansions). Let's hope that after all this time they will listen to 50% of players demands and stuff like Ashran wont happen again because 1 dev think would be cool to walk around with an artifact above your head, 1mil hp and nuke everyone in front of you. Btw, the concept of unique is gone this days, everyone got a stealth, an intrerupt, a stun etc., they give each class the same abilities but with a different name or a different effect.</div></div><hr />

I'm cautiously optimistic for a bombshell announcement today. Something along the lines of &quot;Alliance and Horde can now play together&quot;, &quot;One character can have multiple classes&quot; or something on that level.<br />

I'm sure that information won't get abused/spammed to death now that it's in info gathering bot waters. Some info should just be for internal use only (looking at you WhoIs!). Crossing my fingers for a little nugget of info on a guild oriented town/garrison and/or multi-player oriented housing areas. I don't want to be in the same place as everyone else and not see anyone again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm glad to finally see an SC Warrior, and I'm glad to see Artanis brought in. But I really felt Fenix was the guy for the job. What, will he end up being a specialist dragoon? :&lt;</div></div><hr />

They actually talked about that at gamescom. They want to do Fenix justice and include his Dragoon form as some kind of death trait, but they want to wait so as to not flood the game with death trait heroes (Leoric just came out). They also gave a possible timeframe of half a year.</div></div><hr />

I was hoping Blizzard would understand this as it's the thing that killed my guild that I've had since Cataclysm, we just couldn't make up 10 additional players for 20man raiding... oh well good riddance.</div></div><hr />
