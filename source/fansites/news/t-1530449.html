Lots of HoTS invites have been going out as well for the &quot;Technical Alpha&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Called it. Wildstar week release.<br />
<br />
Yeah, not really surprised. A lot of streamers have said that if Blizzard did it (like everyone thought they would) they wouldn't bother covering it for a couple weeks to give WildStar its due diligence.</div></div><hr />

What's going out by mail is a notification that your account has been flagged. There are no keys.</div></div><hr />

I have a dead period of about two months after Monday (mandatory conscription in my country so have to do my army service, thus after exams, stopping job and relaxing). I am not gonna get to play WoD for months:( (even though I preordered and don't plan to cancel that, just my sub). I can tell you, if you give me an alpha access right now, I will be glued to my screen for the next two months testing! I am a grammar nazi! I am an Aspie with an interest in weird mob behaviours! Seriously, give me an invite I will test the crap out of it.</div></div><hr />

Precisely. And keep in mind that during MoP beta a lot of people got the mail a considerable time after being flagged for it. I got the mail almost one day after I started playing (already had the beta listed on my account).</div></div><hr />

Thank god for that, we don't need another Hearthstone fiasco of selling the keys for beta access. Ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard if you want people to enjoy your game, get better customer service people, and let people decide on what they want to get, and let them get a chance to get the pets in game, until you remove them completely. <br />
Well anyway still I am still a Warcraft, but I wish you could more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Congratulations! You've been selected to participate in the alpha test of World of Warcraft®: Warlords of Draenor™.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As an alpha test participant, you'll experience the new content and features of Warlords of Draenor before the expansion is released. Over the course of testing, you’ll venture through the Dark Portal, establish your Garrison, and fight back against the Iron Horde!<br />
<br />
<br />
For this early phase of alpha testing, we’re focusing on the Horde experience in Frostfire Ridge, a harsh land of ceaseless winter and volcanic peaks. You’ll need to create a new character (only Horde is available, at least for now); we’ll give it some gear and level it to 90, and then you’ll be on your way! We’ll be adding lots more content and features as the alpha test progresses—head to our forums to keep tabs on the latest.</div></div><hr />

This foolish argument again? I mean the notion that maybe they are opening up the testing a bit now is due to it being ready is out of the question? Or the fact that even if they purposely avoided every release of every 'rival' game they'd never be able to do anything? Of course not.<br />

No. The complaint is that they knew wildstar was releasing, so they would release something at the same time to keep interest in wow. They withheld the alpha until a day after wildstar, unless you really believe that they coincidentally had alpha ready within 24 hours of the release of it's biggest modern rival.</div></div><hr />

I am not even sure how to respond to this... but I will briefly try.<br />
<br />
The two biggest MMO releases this year (outside of Destiny, which I won't explain why Blizz isn't trying to compete with it... and if you are wondering, then don't bother posting) are ESO and WS. On ESO launch date Blizz posts a gigantic blog about WoD alpha and announces it is starting. The day after WS release it (2 months after announcing WoD alpha) the alpha finally begins.<br />
<br />
But sure, it is just pure coincidence. I guess ignorance is bliss (for some).</div></div><hr />

On ESO launch date Blizz posts a gigantic blog about WoD alpha and announces it is starting. The day after WS release it (2 months after announcing WoD alpha) the alpha finally begins.<br />
<br />
But sure, it is just pure coincidence. I guess ignorance is bliss (for some).<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if this is the case, whats the issue?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But only ALPHA? After all this time? What have they been doing for the past 5+ months?<br />
<br />
As has been said numerous times, this time around, the distinction between &quot;Alpha&quot; <br />
and &quot;Beta&quot; is purely the number of players being invited.<br />
<br />
<br />
So anyone can get an invite now or is it just streamers/friends and family atm?<br />
<br />
This seems to be the case.</div></div><hr />

Beta will be still closed, but those who get guaranteed beta spot (like PAX invitations this time) can get in. Its more like Beta is when Blizzard is comfortable having larger number of players in.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tziva</div><div class="date">2014-06-04, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No. The complaint is that they knew wildstar was releasing, so they would release something at the same time to keep interest in wow. They withheld the alpha until a day after wildstar, unless you really believe that they coincidentally had alpha ready within 24 hours of the release of it's biggest modern rival.<br />
Even if it was true that the alpha was intentionally put off to line up with the Wildstar release -- which I don't think is the case -- this whole theory relies on the assumption that doing so would be beneficial to Blizzard.<br />
<br />
I don't see how starting their alpha at the same approximate time as a popular competitor helps them any. Streamers are occupied, MMO fans are occupied, gaming media is occupied. There is no way a limited alpha can remotely compete with the hype from a shiny new game, so even trying is just going to cost them attention not &quot;keep interest in WoW.&quot; <br />

To me that is the biggest rebuttal to these theories: the dubious premise that trying to compete with another wildly popular game somehow ends up with the alpha on top.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah you're right we should all just bitch and complain when a game breaking bug ends up making it to release instead of spending 30 seconds filling out a ticket/submitting feedback while testing is going on. If you're not helping to find issues you're a waste of an invite.<br />

Damage control? Wildstar has its fair set of issues that'll drive people back to wow. They are simply trying to overshadow other games. Nothing new.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hogging media attention doesn't necessarily entail you trying to come out 'on top' in the short term.<br />
<br />
Most streamers will stream whatever gets them the most viewers, because that's how they make a living. Already at least one relatively big streamer is streaming WoD alpha instead of Wildstar. It's not necessarily bad (dependent on your PoV)--that's just how business is in nearly every field. I just think it's weird that some people don't grasp how corporations and competition works, though. It's not like all these things apply to retail, electronics, etc. and all of a sudden video games is some field of products that's immune to these rules, as much as the faithful adherents to a company would otherwise believe.</div></div><hr />

I mean the notion that maybe they are opening up the testing a bit now is due to it being ready is out of the question? Or the fact that even if they purposely avoided every release of every 'rival' game they'd never be able to do anything? Of course not.<br />
<br />
This community is so toxic. Complain that there's nothing new. Complain when there's something new. It never ends.<br />
<br />
The community complains there's nothing new, which there isn't, it's fast approaching a year without WoW content. Blizzard then release the ALPHA build the day after a rival MMO releases and try and act innocent about the timing hoping that the dangling of a manky horribly unfinished carrot will keep their more blinkered fans from trying something else.<br />
<br />
Toxic does not mean &quot;people who don't like WoW/Blizzard&quot;. It's like folks who insist people who disagree with their point of view are trolling. <br />
<br />
Alpha builds are usually the barely functional internal testing/development builds. They aren't for consumer consumption but Blizzard have NOTHING to counter other MMO's with so continue to use cheap tactics. Now, that's fine, they're a business, all credit to them for using every option they have to entice customers but they could have, you know, actually had something close to release by now with the money they're getting thrown at them.</div></div><hr />

Not really. This is a time where a few/some/many/ect players feel Blizzard is acting shady and NOT with the best interest of the players in mind. This can easily be seen as a blatant lie to the faces of the player base. Of course its good marketing, but lying about it at this time in WoW's life cycle is not the best of moves.<br />
<br />
I like WoW, I like Wildstar, I am not going to take a side. I saw this coming from a mile away and so did many others, the point is that they came out and literally said they don't do this, then literally a short while later they do what they said they don't. That is where the issue lies in this specifically, its the dishonesty and continuing degradation of Blizzard being honest, upfront, and trusted that is in question.<br />

Here's hoping I will be able to find a few minutes here and there to at least look at screenshots, if not some streaming footage. Of course, I don't want any spoilers, so like anyone who wants to save their experience until live release, just checking the data that comes in via tweets and MMO-Champ should suffice. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Drive people back to all the new content in WoW.. Oh wait. Wildstar is new and shiny, the servers are loaded with queues already even with the bugs. WoW launched with plenty of bugs, if you were around the servers were basically unplayable for the first week and very rickety for a couple of weeks after. This was expected when all the big streamers quit streaming Warcraft and started streaming Wildstar non-stop. Obviously we all know this, I just think it's laughable that it's &quot;a select few&quot; people which most happen to be large streamers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alpha, in name only. It's being called alpha by Blizz because of the small number of <br />
testers they're inviting. Once they invite 'X' more, they'll call it beta. My guess is <br />
that all of the zones will be tested fully, along with dungeons and pvp, and raid <br />
tests beginning, then beta will open.<br />
<br />
<br />
are we even gonna get any new stuff with this?.. since people already datamined everything right?<br />
<br />
Lots, there's plenty that was somewhat behind a tech wall until now, like the specifics <br />
of quests. According to Simca, they're starting datamining on that now. As well as raid <br />
items, but item data is broken, so a workaround is being looked into.<br />
<br />
Plus, as the poster below me said, plenty of Garrison stuff we've yet to have seen really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There're at least a few of the Horde Garrison buildings in now that I don't remember seeing before, so there's probably a bunch of stuff to come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here we go again.<br />
<br />
Bet you 50$ that wildstar will:<br />
<br />
A: not make a dent on the subscription of wow. (Much like how SWTOR and GW2, and any other would-be-wow-killer didn't do so much as a scratch)<br />
<br />
B: Likely be forced to either go F2P or go against their &quot;we are HARDCORE ONLY&quot; philosophy when they realize that, surprise surprise, the market for the nintendo-hard games isn't as large as they think it is. You know, just like how GW2 had to give up and bring gear progression to lure people in because once the novelty wore off, people were leaving in droves.<br />
<br />
Why must we go through this shit with EVERY.SINGLE.MMO.RELEASE? Get it through your head, wow is here to stay, and not wildstar, nor archage, nor [insert MMO name here] is gonna do anything about that.</div></div><hr />

&quot;I want better loot for a mode that is so easy even clinically dead people can complete it, but since you don't want to give me what I want, I'm gonna go play a game that's so fucking hard, even korean players who can beat resident evil on extreme mode with just a knife are dying in droves to even the earliest trash on the first dungeon.

<br />
The two biggest MMO releases this year (outside of Destiny, which I won't explain why Blizz isn't trying to compete with it... and if you are wondering, then don't bother posting) are ESO and WS. On ESO launch date Blizz posts a gigantic blog about WoD alpha and announces it is starting. The day after WS release it (2 months after announcing WoD alpha) the alpha finally begins.<br />
<br />
But sure, it is just pure coincidence. I guess ignorance is bliss (for some).<br />
<br />
They announce alpha on the release date of one MMO, and they start sending out invites the day after the release of another?<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's anything but coincidence, obviously Blizzard has their whole game plan mapped out with hardcore counters to releases like releasing a blog and sending out a handful of alpha invites :rolleyes:<br />
<br />

I'm hoping there's some sort of slider or toggle, too. It might be helpful for others, but I want to be able to disable that hideous outline feature.<br />

UPDATE: There is no option as of yet to disable the highlights. Keep sending your feedback to let Blizzard know we need one. There is an option! :D</div></div><hr />

Some serious talk about scaling them, which makes me incredibly excited.

Do tell, how was this game ever a skillful one outside of areas that aren't MEANT to be a challenge? You might be pissy because of who gets a key, but this game is no dumber now than it was 6 years ago when I started. Some areas are made for easy access, others are made for the more dedicated and skilled. Cry more.<br />
<br />
Horrible, one comes to share excitement and thoughts with fellow wow fans but all there is on these forums is bitching and moaning about anything made to the game or not made. Not to mention the idiots turning anything I to a tactic from blizzard's side to counter wildstar...<br />

If it was ready, releasing it asap shoulda been prio with how long a lot of folk have waited now. It seems like what is here now was probably here on say Monday. I'd have liked it before WildStar's launch, before is always better than letting a big competitor launch then pulling attention from them within days.</div></div><hr />

Seriously the people streaming this are terrible, most don't even know what half their spells do.<br />
<br />
After waiting all these months to see the game in action, they're giving bads alpha access, reminding us just how dumbed down they made the game, where even the most awful can succeed.<br />

Seriously, you sound like the most entitled whiny brat that cry when another kid gets the hot Christmas toy and you didn't get it. <br />

Am I happy that Alpha has gone out ? yes it means we are one step closer. Am I bothered that streamers have got it and I haven't ? Not in the slightest. I will happily wait for the retail product to go out rather than play a version that is up and down more than a hookers knickers.</div></div><hr />

Ok...meanwhile, one can assume that they would have been called dicks had they released it a week before Wildstar as well. People being sidetracked from Wildstar over an ALPHA probably aren't interested in that game anyway. <br />

Had they released it 2 weeks before Wildstar released, it would have been the same shit. &quot;Lool they're scared now trying to counter the blow!&quot;. Had they released it 1 week from now, it would have been the same just &quot;guess they are in trouble nooow!&quot;.<br />

WoW stuff would get released regardless of other mmos being released. Considering the dates speculated for WoD expansion release, this month seemed like a pretty surefire bet for more news.</div></div><hr />

You don't think it's a rather strange coincidence that practically the entire internet predicted the the WoD test would drop either last week or this week.. and suddenly it happens? It's clear what Blizzard are up to.. especially when you also factor in a large number of twitch streamers all got invited into the test. Blizzard are blatantly trying to disrupt Wildstar's launch and deny it traction and twitch air time. Now some may say that's business. But IMHO it's starting to appear like Blizzard is the bully in the MMO playground by delaying their own test just to drop it at a time to do most damage to another MMO's launch. I don't like that.</div></div><hr />

The Grinning Reaver and Warforged Nightmare have been added to in the game shop. Keep in mind this is alpha, so items can be added to the shop just for testing purposes.<br />
One of the mounts will probably end up in the store (he Grinning Reaver), while the other mount becomes a RaF mount (Warforged Nightmare).</div></div><hr />

Seriously, I do wonder about some people. And not in a good way.<br />

As stated many, many, many, many, MANY times before, Blizzard can't release anything without being accused of something like this. And if they release no info people freak out, and if they release info people freak out. People need to stfu and focus on what they like rather then attacking Blizzard over every minor thing, it just makes you look like a sad, obsessed addict who can't get over their WoW habit.<br />

<br />
Grasping at straws now. Why would Blizzard delay something like limited release Alpha because of another game being launched?<br />
<br />
Everyone knows that BLizzard is no longer releasing stuff &quot;when its ready&quot;. It releases it when OTHER games are ready.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much. Also, as some people have called it, exactly at the Wildstar release date. The continuous naivety exhibited by some of the posters on this site regarding big business practices continues to amuse me. It really makes you wonder about the degree to which their lives have been sheltered from the realities of life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is... WOW alpha has nothing to offer against Wildstar right now. Players are desperate to PLAY fresh content... Not just watch it. Even many of the streamers that have alpha invite are not gonna bother with WOW right now cause they are having much more fun progressing in Wildstar.</div></div><hr />

I was going to say something like this :)<br />
<br />
Well their strategy will not really work as Wildstar will have a major content updtate every month....I dont see blizzard throwing things every month lol. But who knows?</div></div><hr />

Again: Apart from the fact that Blizzard said that they wouldn't schedule their releases around other MMOs, how does it matter? <br />
Aligning it with the Wildstar release just makes sense.</div></div><hr />

Delay a beta for a few months to counter a competitor's release? That really does make a lot of sense. Let's not try to get content out faster so people don't grow bored of doing the same stuff for over a year.</div></div><hr />

Blizzards CEO promised a new expansion every 12 months when Burning Crusade launched in 2006...<br />
<br />
There is a difference between a promise and a reality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd find it interesting for someone to list all the Blizz release events that just happen to coincide with the release of a competitive game.<br />
<br />
If I was on the board at Blizz, and I could release alpha/beta/major releases whenever, I'd probably try to time them either during holidays or to trump the competition. It's just good business.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the day? Around the time? Not picking holes but what's the time frame around the release of another game where we can say that anything blizzard announces is because of it?<br />
<br />
I ask because releasing an alpha to a limited number of people 2 days AFTER the main launch (5 if you count early access) of Wildstar just doesn't seem like much of a plan if you want to stop people being interested in another game.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just me but if there's a choice between a new game I can actually play, and some patch notes / a stream, I can tell you now which one I'd rather do :)<br />
<br />
Also I'm having trouble finding the &quot;similar things&quot; they did before.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to say they didn't, please don't see this as me being an ass :) <br />
<br />
I just know how this community works, the daily updates we could have been seeing because they have things to say instantly become &quot;the answer to X game&quot; when they happen to run across the release date of something. <br />
<br />
If enough people read &quot;it was an answer to...&quot; they start to repeat it and eventually a myth grows up around it, like &quot;LFR killed the community&quot;, I've already seen one thread where someone tried to claim the valour buff is the answer to Wildstart....<br />
<br />
Can you remember any of the announcements they made?</div></div><hr />

I don't get it...Wildstar has been praised, fans of it have been among the most cocky since SWTOR was about to be released, yet now people seem to feel sorry and angry on behalf of Wildstar because Blizzard gives a TINY part of the WoW community access to an alpha featuring ONE zone...it's not even a proper content release, it's no patch, no release date, no Beta...<br />
<br />
Sorry Blizzard, seems you can't do anything right these days! Wait too long and you're lazy moneygrubbers, release anything at any time and you are bullies trying to one up other mmos on the market.<br />
<br />
I'm not &quot;the worst kind of fanboy&quot;, not even close, and I still think it's beyond silly how people make this release all about WoW vs some other game rather than just what it is...a small release of information that only a few can access and show to the rest.</div></div><hr />

I totally agree with you on everything you said here, unfortunately this is how society is now days, so may self entitled whiners makes you want to slap some of them about a bit to knock some sense into them..<br />
<br />
Main thing will be is to see how Wildstar is 12 months from now.. But as you said everyone was so cocky about how awesome SWTOR was going to be and within about a year or so it went F2P, main problem was you had EA running the show..<br />

Precisely 100% makes me wonder if all the pro Wildstar people are just that little bit insecure about how well Wildstar will fair.. I mean look at SWTOR that had loads of money chucked at it, the most well known and awesome IP a pretty good development team making it, and yet it still failed to go gangbusters and went F2P about a year or so later..</div></div><hr />

Well that much is clear. Whilst many are praising Wildstar, and rightly so in my opinion, the only ones that seem to acting cockily are the usual WOW fans who once again label a new game a WOW killer on behalf of the new game's players so they can revel in said games failure to fulfill their prophecy. I don't see anyone feeling sorry or angry on behalf of Wildstar, perhaps you are projecting your own feelings on to others, merely people expressing that they expected Blizzard to do something to draw attention away from a competitor. The alpha release is an expected and predictable move on Blizzard's part, a move which is played out each and everyday by different companies across the globe in response to their competitors, there is nothing to be hurt or angry about.<br />
<br />
It is not about the amount of people that get access to testing it is about keeping WOW in the news, making sure that people don't forget about WOW even though they might be playing other games. I would have been more worried had Blizzard done nothing.</div></div><hr />

Pretty bold words, will just wait and see if they can do what you say they promised can do.. A lot of other devs had said the same thing over the years and have not done so well..<br />

I think you will find that the hatred to both games from both sides is about equal.. Example quotes on here have been &quot;Lol that sucks glad I will be playing Wildstar..&quot; and the like from the other side as well, but in the end I don't care the amount of rabid frothing at the mouth from some people on both sides has gotten ridiculous..</div></div><hr />

Yes, I'm devastated about us getting information, however small a portion it may be, on behalf of Wildstar. Despite having no interest at all in that game, it has crushed me that Blizzard bullies it by releasing information.<br />
<br />
Newsflash, YOU not seeing it, doesn't mean it never happens. ;d. There have been plenty of raving fanbois (ie, not wow players pretending to be!) around Wildstar just as any other mmo release. If you won't acknowledge that many of them were genuine fans of the game, then you're just in denial for whatever reason.</div></div><hr />

What the hell are you talking about? You sound completely irrational.<br />
<br />
Undoubtedly there are Wildstar fans who believe that it will be a WOW killer however the majority do not share this point of view, just as the majority ESO, SWTOR or Rift players before them did not believe their game of choice would kill WOW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wildstar release week or not....I have no interest in Wildstar anyhow, so it doesn't matter. And if you were hellbend on quitting WoW and getting Wildstar, you should still buy Wildstar and not care about WoW...</div></div><hr />
