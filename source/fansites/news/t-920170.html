<br />
and nothing to elemental either, except the LB glyph... a bit confusing since they have been waffling over basically all other DPS who are already performing better, and they're tweaking their numbers up and down... but have left enhance and elemental [almost] untouched... yeah I don't know either<br />
<br />
Don't forget they changed how our godawful convoluted AoE works by messing with the whole flame shock thing... doesn't make much sense. They went from one odd design to another. Other classes have 1-2 things they can do for AoE, ours is magma, chain lightning, flame shock, then fire nova (and sometimes putting up flame shock on multiple targets)... which is like, how many GCD's? and if you're lucky with all that, you might get close to someone else in terms of damage<br />

Yeah, but is nothing. i play a deathknight.<br />
I only see this change (nerf) a great way to get rid of all dk noobs who see a nerf and start running scared and crying, I dont mind the nerf of healing, damage, or cc, in any way the good deathknights will prevail. the rest will run and play frost mages.</div></div><hr />

I guess &quot;to the ground&quot; is extremely subjective these days. 50% nerf to damage? 2% nerf to damage? Ah who cares, they all get lumped in the &quot;nerfed to the ground&quot; category.<br />

what exactly are they doing to warriors to make them nerfed so badly?.there nerfing arms,but that was probably working as intended because as far as i know fury is still going to be doing pretty good <br />

Searching the news feed is not that hard. Go to page 3.<br />
Also, its ridiculous with everything costing 3-5 orbs that orbs are STILL BoP. I do not want to spend 3-4 hours and win every orb, just so I can make one piece of gear.</div></div><hr />

SW:TOR reaches out to a totally different fan base? You mean kids that grew up on Star Wars never played D&amp;D too? Wow, I didn't know that. I didn't know that gamers stuck to one flavor of one genre exclusively for their entire gaming lives, either. I see your point, there's absolutely no way that guy who was interested in MMOs and played WoW would ever be interested in a Star Wars MMO, except, well, you said you're leaving WoW for Star Wars...<br />

My thoughts exactly, he tries to belittle my argument then goes right ahead and proves my theory. MMOs are comparable no matter the content. Not everyone is willing to expend the resources and time to every new MMO while keeping the old ones. WoW has changed and I know many people who are leaving because of it or just because they are getting bored of it (it is about 7 years old)<br />
<br />
Just because people like WoW doesn't mean they hate Star Wars, chances are its the opposite correlation (someone who likes wow is probably more likely to like SW then any other random person who dosn't like/play WoW). Nerds are nerds and SW is a big cornerstone of the nerd community.<br />
<br />
TOR is new and WoW is twitching close to death (did you see the recent news about the drop in subscriptions despite opening it up to a whole new market?). Microtansactions charging insane amounts (considering the small amount of effort it takes to make ONE mount/pet when $13 a month gets you like 2-5 each month) is a bad omen for WoW and is one of the many things I know are scaring people off. Give Blizzard an inch and pretty soon they will take a mile and plenty of idiots are giving them inches when they buy that retarded lion (which dosn't even have the lure of part of it going to charity).<br />
<br />
Many people arn't pathetic enough to devote insane amounts of time to two MMOs and TOR already has a sizable amount of fans lining up so I stand by my statement before; I hope TOR destroys WoW and finally puts this twitching pony to rest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. Enhancement shaman use agility based one-handed weapons, ideally with hit and mastery on them (though crit+mastery would be just fine with me). Most enhancement shaman on the Horde side are Orcs and prefer using axes or one-handed fist weapons to benefit from the passive expertise racial. I'm flabbergasted to see that not one of the many crafted weapons works for enhancement shamans. This is consistent with patch 4.0.6 however--the enhancement craft-able weapon required a ridiculous number of Hardened Elementium Bars (I think it was 25--no joke). By the time Blizzard had fixed the recipe, it was too late for it to be of much use anyway.<br />
<br />
I'm no Blizzard hater--I still have faith that they just haven't added the recipe to the list yet! I'm saving True Gold just in case...</div></div><hr />
