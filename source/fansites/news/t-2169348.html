PTR Build Deploy 2/14/2017<br />
Greetings all,<br />
<br />
PTR realms have begun to spin down in order to deploy a new 7.2.0 build this afternoon. No ETA for today's push but I'll ping this thread if things look like they're going to take longer than usual (~4-6 hours).<br />
<br />
I'll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines. <br />
<br />
Thanks everyone!<br />
<br />

Me neither - it's up to them to let others take the name and keep raiding, or retire. But as I don't follow the world first world, are new guilds coming up to replace the old school guilds that are dropping out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Somehow, new guilds always came up. Or guilds that were close, rose to the occasion. There was a time when Death and Taxes or Nihilum led the boards, when Method was behind. When there were guilds like Stars and Vodka. Quite interesting to look at wowprogress back to tier 8. Or this http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/16397-WoW_world_first_list</div></div><hr />

How would you know it's garbage without ever touching it? Unless you did touch it :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit; What I've gathered so far. This event can be completed by simply finishing (no need to win) games against AI... any difficulty setting. Music to my ears, I'm ready for a free mount! Am I worried that I'm having fun? Yes. Yes I am, no other game of this type has ever managed to entertain me and yet here I've played 3 matches even without the event being live until later on... o.O</div></div><hr />
