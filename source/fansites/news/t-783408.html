Arena Season 9 Models Preview<br />
It's time for some PvP love! Just like with any model preview, you have to keep in mind that I don't have really have any decent way to check how the sets are supposed to be displayed in the first place and it always lead to a few errors (Mostly on glove/boots models). The multi race/gender preview will most likely be available when Blizzard finishes polishing the sets and actually deploy them on beta servers. <br />

Divine Storm<br />
We've been toying with a change to Divine Storm to make it more like Fan of Knives. Specifically, you could use it whenever you want, for mana, but it would share a cooldown with Crusader Strike. It would have nothing to do with Holy Power (unless Divine Purpose still applied). The idea would be that sometimes you're okay giving up the single target rotation of Crusader Strike -&gt; Templar's Verdict in return for being able to use an AE attack every 4.5 to 3 sec. It's too early yet to know if this design will work out.<br />
<br />
Divine Storm has a great visual and many long-time Ret paladins have a soft spot for it, so we'd like to get it back to more common use. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27509091869/ret-aoe-divine-storm/))<br />

Searing Totem<br />
As I said a few weeks ago, we're still working on the AI of Searing Totem. If we can chill out its latent homicidal tendencies, then we could consider bumping the range. Currently bumping the range would just infuriate your group leader more often. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27509091757/searing-totem/))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does anyone else have another picture of that NPC there? Because that's the only picture that I've seen of it and all the other times I've seen it posted, someone said that it was a photo manip/model edit.<br />
<br />
edit: I mean if anything, can someone else put out a picture that's higher quality? The JPEG compression if anything makes it look kinda gross and is below the standard of images put on MMO-Champ, if not concealing the photoshopping/model editing.<br />
<br />
I mean, I'm not saying this as to crap on Redshirt's parade. I think it WOULD be an awesome idea to make some sort of reference to him... but the 3 times that I've seen this picture before, it was tagged with &quot;hoax&quot;.<br />

Not just guts but in his case alot of courage because he has Asperger Syndrome<br />

Imo he kinda owned Blizzard for not knowing their lore and for reward got immortalised as WoW NPC :)</div></div><hr />

Does anyone else have another picture of that NPC there? Because that's the only picture that I've seen of it and all the other times I've seen it posted, someone said that it was a photo manip/model edit.<br />

edit: I mean if anything, can someone else put out a picture that's higher quality? The JPEG compression if anything makes it look kinda gross and is below the standard of images put on MMO-Champ, if not concealing the photoshopping/model editing.<br />

I mean, I'm not saying this as to crap on Redshirt's parade. I think it WOULD be an awesome idea to make some sort of reference to him... but the 3 times that I've seen this picture before, it was tagged with &quot;hoax&quot;.<br />

Hunter set looks ... interestingly weird ... did suddenly all hunters got their right eye poked? And whats that flames on the back O.O seems like &quot;fusion/merge points&quot; of some mecha anime O.O<br />
Mage one looks a little plain imho, would better suit a healer of some sort.<br />
Palas as always look robocop'ish, thou this time witha little birdish traits. Still very nice set.<br />
Rogue looks almost ninja like. But more spikes couldn't hurt could they ^^?<br />
Shaman helm looks almost like boxing helm O.O<br />

<br />
Does anyone else have another picture of that NPC there? Because that's the only picture that I've seen of it and all the other times I've seen it posted, someone said that it was a photo manip/model edit.<br />
<br />
edit: I mean if anything, can someone else put out a picture that's higher quality? The JPEG compression if anything makes it look kinda gross and is below the standard of images put on MMO-Champ, if not concealing the photoshopping/model editing.<br />
<br />
I mean, I'm not saying this as to crap on Redshirt's parade. I think it WOULD be an awesome idea to make some sort of reference to him... but the 3 times that I've seen this picture before, it was tagged with &quot;hoax&quot;.<br />

<br />
Ok in my opinion, the Warrior one minus the helm looks alright. Hunter, comparing to the others is nice. To Paladins: DON'T COMPLAIN! It seems like Blizzard stopped forcing you to wear pink... but as previously said you'll look like birdmen power rangers LOL! Oh my god... They really should have used Cata to enhance armor textures allowing them to make more detailed sets. With the current engine and how little detail there are, they really don't have many options left.<br />
<br />
As for the Red Shirt Guy, he deserved it. He slapped Blizzard in the face with LORE... THEY MAKE THE LORE (sort of) and a FAN tells you your lore is wrong, he deserves a freaking NPC!<br />

I don't see an issue with this. If they implement it like that it has to be exactly like that. If they take make it same CD as CS and hit less on single mobs it would still be worthless to use because we want to be able to build up HP.</div></div><hr />

Samurai Helmet<br />
Pirate Patch<br />
Spikes and Horns<br />

&quot;Fiery glow&quot; effect on the back of shoulders and helmet<br />

yeah there's no denying that.<br />

all the sets look passable this season. I really hope they don't go for the &quot;evolving&quot; pvp gear like they did for some of us last expansion. the shaman one didn't get good until season8 when the shoulders looked half-decent.</div></div><hr />

I also loved the eyepatch of the hunter, worthy look of a pirate. <br />
The druid set looks pretty feral, like a druid should look. Great job. <br />
And the DK set is awesome incarnate thanks to the awesome helmet (judge dredd!)<br />

Also liked the priest set (it's like a dervish), only slightly more plate. Which is actually annoying me a little - why do clothies have to look so darned plat-ey?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Revrant</div><div class="date">2010-10-31, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering what all the fuss was about the Red Shirt Guy. After watching his video and the reply to it, I'd buy the guy a round if I could. It takes a lot of courage to get up in front of peers like he did. Especially with this community. Top that with pointing out a flaw in lore to the Loreman himself, Metzen and.... dude is a damn badass! Major kudos to him! I'm a damn confident guy and that's not something I could do.<br />
<br />
I could point out a dozen lore flaws to the man himself, they're easy to find, the thing that bugs me is it wasn't really a flaw, it was an assumption, when Kurdran returned to Azeroth he became High Thane again, he was lost during the Second War and thus someone else had to become High Thane, and seeing as how it was his brother traditionally when the original leader returns, after being assumed dead, he resumes leading.<br />
<br />
Though it was funny they didn't even know Falstad wasn't dead, they still did what would have been the logical thing even though he was alive.<br />
<br />
Also, wow, the Season 9 Hunter is 100 times better than the Tier 11 Hunter, I get to look like SHREDDER instead of a retarded half dead stupid ****ing murloc.<br />

<br />
Anyone could. Could they do it at Blizzcon, infront of hundreds of people, on a big screen, with their voice echoing over the arena without sounding like a robot?<br />
<br />
Not only is it how the guy sounded but the response he got. In the book Falstad was said to become a member of the three hammers, yet it was given to Kuradin. In the game Falstad was the leader of the Wildhammer in Aerie Peak from Vanilla upto WoTLK! Yet, the &quot;loreman&quot; thought he was dead.</div></div><hr />

edit: I hope they leave Divine Storm alone. I'm quite happy with it working off Holy Power and I really don't want to trade a guaranteed holy power for a little AoE.

Apparently I am. I have no idea what this picture is about. I re-read the links and it just said something about someone becoming an internet hero.
