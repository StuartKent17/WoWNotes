It's time for the first real preview of Tier 12 armor sets! As I said in yesterday's news post a lot of Tier 12 sets got a lot of bad feedback from the community based on poor/rushed previews, I'm not saying that they all look awesome but the Tier 12 Shaman definitely got some bad press because people couldn't render his effect properly. See for yourself. <br />
<br />
You can expect more previews tomorrow, and yes, I lied about the Warlock video being today, I had a slight issue with the female models and they just didn't look right. This is already fixed but I didn't want to delay the Shaman preview further. <br />
<br />
In any case, I suggest that you wait for the &quot;good&quot; previews before you decide if a set is good or bad and complain about it everywhere, for the sake of my moderators. <br />
<br />
PS: The armor set available to player is the fire one, the green one is most likely a recolor and will only be used for non-set or NPCs. <br />

Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest Hotfixed<br />
Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71086/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest/) has been hotfixed on test realms and had its stats considerably increased. Additionally, the proc datamined a few days ago is now confirmed as well!<br />
<br />
The critical strike rating has been changed to haste rating and all the stats have been increased, also, Blizzard took the opportunity to shatter people's hope with this hotfix and properly set the staff as &quot;Bind on Pickup&quot;. <br />
<br />

I almost did it. But then I realized that some people will interpret it as the real set, etc ... <br />
<br />
That's why I didn't post rushed/shitty previews in the first place, I could rush them and &quot;skip&quot; some of the effects but in the end my news posts have too much impact on player feedback and I just can't do whatever I want just to call &quot;OMG OMG OMG FIRSSSSSSSTZ!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm guessing because Haste is better than Crit for the majority of caster dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Crit isn't as universal for casters as haste is, all offensive casting classes need haste, where as not all offensive casting classes need crit, like afflic locks and shadow priests</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slavemaker</div><div class="date">2011-05-18, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So let me get this straight... If I was able to get the staff as an elemental shaman and got my lava burst to proc and the staff, I'd cast 2 full lava bursts and one at half damage?<br />
<br />
BRB new pants.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RadGH</div><div class="date">2011-05-18, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every caster has at least a soft haste cap which is almost always top priority after hit cap. You can reforge the rest off of your gear, and go for crit. Not every caster prefers crit.<br />
<br />
For my fire mage, I have reached the 15% haste cap with Dark Intent granted by a warlock. When I obtain this staff, I will need to do some minor reforging to end up as close to that 15% mark again. The rest can be reforged into crit. This includes other gear you are wearing, too.<br />
<br />
I wonder about the proc from this staff. If it proc'd for say, Combustion, a 2 minute cooldown which can be incredibly powerful, it could potentially be a huge DPS increase. But more likely than not, the buff will simply refresh before ever ticking, and wasting the proc.<br />
<br />
Hopefully blizzard handles this. It should allow the dot to stack.<br />
<br />
If handled correctly, this is perhaps one of the most interesting procs I have seen yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Theorycrafting math for nearly all DPS caster specs point to the superiority of haste over crit, especially true for specs where a spell critting is a certainty under certain conditions (ie, Elemental Shamans).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now someone needs to find out how the proc works for dot heavy classes and I'll be happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As this is a fairly complex buff to develop, we don’t have a release date to share quite yet. It’s important to note that as with some of the other convenience-oriented features we offer, certain elements ofTarecgosa's Wrath will be premium-based, though only the players who can actually complete heroic Firelands will need to have access to the premium service. We'll have more details to share with you as development progresses -- in the meantime, you may begin to see elements of the buff appear on the World of Warcraft PTR.</div></div><hr />

Everyone else has a really strong, awesome motif and we got some bird heads on our shoulders and then what looks like a generic leather pvp set with some feathers on it. And I can't even describe what's going on with the helm...sigh...<br />
<br />
ALSO...I think what really works with the shaman set is that it's simple. You can look at it and there's large identifiable shapes instead of a huge amount of little itty bitty details like in some of the other sets. It looks like a warcraft set...some of the other sets I think go way too much into small little symbols and details and it ends up looking like nothing.

I'm glad that the crit was changed to haste. (OMG BLIZZ LIKES MAGES MORE THAN OTHERS OMG)<br />

But the thing I am most happy with is the decrease in DPS. Going from 948.1 dps to 948.0 is amazing since this way feral druids can't abuse this staff.</div></div><hr />

The Rogue set is another case of &quot;bad&quot; preview I think, it really doesn't look as bad as people think as long as you see it in full size and with proper effects. <br />
<br />
However, if I had to give a personal opinion, I'd say that Blizzard screwed up by trying to keep the &quot;Fire&quot; color scheme for all the sets, the 2 recolors of the Rogue sets look incredibly better.<br />

Yeah I wasnt sure how to interpret that when they mentioned the proc. Is it that you turn into the Dragon WHEN the staff procs or is it an On Use effect to summon what is effectively a mount like the Vial? Im hoping the latter, that would be bad ass whereas Ive always hated trinket type effects that turn you into a spiv for a period of time</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was my first thought :o<br />
Second thought was that I should get back on my shaman right now :D Shapeshifted druids don't show armor..<br />
Third thought was about the staff. It says duplicate the spell: Does that mean everything, not just the damaging spells? As someone else said, does it polymorph a sheep into a sheep? (doubling the duration?) Does it Drain Life to heal its wielder? (:D Or itself, and what does that even mean :D) How about procs? Will it have its own critrates? If it does indeed do more than doubling the damage, there's alot to theorycraft, and I can see some people whining over how they deserved the staff and not their guildy that got it now..</div></div><hr />

Every caster has at least a soft haste cap which is almost always top priority after hit cap. You can reforge the rest off of your gear, and go for crit. Not every caster prefers crit.<br />
For my fire mage, I have reached the 15% haste cap with Dark Intent granted by a warlock.<br />

If this staff lasted into the next expansion you would call that balanced??? Really?

And also, my guess is that for the procc (if it proccs on a dot) then it will probably do the full amount of damage up front. If it doesn't, then something like corruption will probably just appear on the target as &quot;Wrath of Tarecgosa&quot; So that warlocks don't get an excessive boost due to felhunter's shadow bite, Everlasting affliction, nightfall, soul swap, soul siphon, siphon life.</div></div><hr />

The Shaman sets look awesome, but why do you say the green is likely just an NPC version? In t11, there are two varieties - all set and offset pieces of 359 are one color and all set and offset pieces of 372 are there same color. Do you think that will change this tier?</div></div><hr />

That true and I still dont like the shaman set. Particule effects doesnt make a set necessarly good. If you want to see a good looking shaman set take a look at ten storms or the tier 3. Those were good looking. Technology improved since them but the art in those new sets just went downfall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When we have more of an understanding about what the duplicated spell is then people can say &quot;mage or boomkin&quot; or whatever. <br />
<br />
If it works how i hope it will then theres a chance Firemages can have a second combustion. This would mean that if this second combustion is applied it will do more dmg than the first combustion due to having to add the damage already stacked from the original combustion + other dots on the target.<br />
<br />
I understand that you could imagine many other possible situations for other classes but the above would be awsome but insane.</div></div><hr />
