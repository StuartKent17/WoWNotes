ZA Bear Mount and new content patch<br />
No. This item will no longer be available with the release of the next content patch. Mind you this patch will happen before the release of Wrath of the Lich King. <br />
<br />
Rogue changes<br />
Hello rogues,<br />
<br />
We’ve got some updates coming soon for the rogue class and I wanted to duck in and give you a sneak preview of what we’ve been working on as well as our future goals. Below are lists (by no means exhaustive) of some of these changes and goals.<br />
<br />
General<br />
- Quality of life improvements: Removal of various reagents (Thieves’ Tools, Flash Powder) as well as a Poisons skill change. We’re removing the Poisons skill and making the finished poisons available on vendors for purchase. This should free up a fair amount of bag space.<br />
- Envenom: Now also increases your chance to apply poisons by 25% for 2-6 seconds (based on combo points).<br />
- Wounding Poison: No longer stacks. The first application now reduces healing by 50%.<br />
- Anesthetic Poison: Now also removes one Enrage effect from the target.<br />
- Evasion, Sprint, Vanish: Cooldown reduced to 3 minutes. (Talents that reduce cooldown take this down to 2 minutes.)<br />
- Cloak of Shadows: Cooldown increased to 2 minutes. (Elusiveness now reduces this cooldown to 1 minute.)<br />
- A new level 75 ability has been designed. This is going to be one of the bigger teases as we’re not quite ready to talk about this one yet. I will say that will add some much needed group utility.<br />
- Fan of Knives: Weapon normalization to equalize effectiveness regardless of weapons carried.<br />
<br />
Assassination<br />
- Mutilate: No longer requires you be behind the target.<br />
- Relentless Strikes: Talent is too “required” and will be made more accessible. Vigor will replace its spot in the tree and a new talent will be created to fill Vigor’s spot.<br />
- Find Weakness: Made passive to cut down on the number of triggered effects that either don’t affect gameplay or affect it in a negative way.<br />
- Cut to the Chase: No longer requires a critical Eviscerate or Envenom. The finisher just has to land.<br />
- Hunger for Blood: Now removes any harmful physical effect instead of Bleed or Magic effects. Bleed effects will still be removed (as all are physical) as well as effects like Mortal Strike, Aimed Shot, Expose Armor etc…<br />
<br />
Combat<br />
- Riposte: Now generates a combo point.<br />
- Mace Specialization: This will grant armor penetration when using a mace. (The warrior talent will as well.)<br />
- Deflection: Reduced to 3 ranks for 2/4/6% parry. This should soften the prereq for Riposte.<br />
- Fist Weapon Specialization: Merged with Dagger Specialization.<br />
- Dagger Specialization: Renamed Close Quarters Combat, moved to tier 3.<br />
- Dual Wield Specialization: Moved to tier 1. Lightning Reflexes swapped locations with it and still needs a little more “oomph”.<br />
- Unfair Advantage and Stay of Execution: Change to more offensive/utility (read mobility) talents. Too much defense on this tier.<br />
- Killing Spree: Weapon normalization to equalize effectiveness regardless of weapons carried.<br />
<br />
Subtlety<br />
- More attractive Tier 1 to draw in all types of builds.<br />
- Fewer dagger specific talents to allow additional build options.<br />
- Wrongfully Accused: Reviewed. This talent doesn’t fit well in this location. May be moved lower and/or redesigned.<br />
- Shadow Dance: A bit awkward at the moment. Due for some polish and some design tweaks.<br />
<br />
Plenty to do still as you can see. As I mentioned, this isn’t everything we’ve got our eye on but gives you something to discuss and look for in an upcoming beta patch. Please add to the list anything you think needs special attention.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading. I’m going back to work.</div></div><hr />

Before build 8820 the server worked perfectly fine. After 8820 it was a horrid lagfest for a week. The second week the continent servers kept crashing every 10-30 minutes. Then Blizzard moves to Germany for a event for one day and the server miraculously worked perfect. Then it turned to a horrid lagfest once again.<br />
<br />
Yesterday the server worked smooth ... until Blizzard decided to restart it. This morning the server worked fine ... until Blizzard decided to restart it once again.<br />
<br />
Now it's down for a new build and low and behold - the authentication server works smooth.<br />
<br />
Even 'Irony' is too big a word for it.* ::)</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/druid/talents2.html<br />
<br />
Balance tree changed. A lot.<br />
<br />
Furor now grants the Moonkin bonus intellect ? Nature's Grasp seems removed, replaced by a talent that increases HoT healing and DoT damage ? <br />
Insect Swarm has talents to improve it, granting synergy with other nature spells ?<br />
<br />
Whole upper tier in Balance seems way more friendlier to the Restoration tree.</div></div><hr />

Rank: 0/1<br />

Allows you to equip two-handed Axes, Maces and Swords in one Hand.<br />
<br />

does this mean the reduced speed is removed? or have i been dreaming and it was never stated in the talent?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I hope thats a fucking joke.<br />
Nothing and I repeat nothing is currently even remotely balanced or even working in the beta. Atleast half of the new talents aren't working correctly or at all.<br />
<br />
And Blizzard themselves said, that there haven't even started to belance the numbers, so they should get atleast some things working before putting it on the PTRs.<br />
Maybe repairing the Servers would be a nice first step...<br />
<br />

Also agree it's too soon for PTR's, there's far too much outstanding work to do on the classes before they stretch themselves to getting things working for a level cap of 70.</div></div><hr />

CloS nerf wich is countered by speccing Subt, way to force Subt as a pvpspec tho :&gt;<br />

unless it's in the first few teirs of sub, it's a decent nerf. With the changes to mutilate and poisons you may just see Assassination being a common pvp spec. I know i will be.<br />

I hope that was a poor attempt of trolling, these are the first real changes to rogues we've seen since the start of beta and most of them well needed.</div></div><hr />
