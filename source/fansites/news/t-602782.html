WotLK spells in 2.3 files<br />
Omg ยง WotLK ยง No, seriously, these spells are probably here to make people happy with a WotLK name they know, but this is probably not the final WotLK version, the expansion is still very far from release.<br />
Anyway, they added the famous Death Knight's [spell=42650] ([spell=42651]), but most of the effect is a server-side script, actually it could be a spell used by a boss in one of the Sunwell Plateau instances.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.3 Screenshots<br />
The almost daily 2.3 screenshots, this time with an ... interesting addition to christmas event (Oh, there is also a [spell=44824] by the way, screenshot here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/flyingreindeer.jpg)). The second one is a screenshot of [item=33993] ! The new pet from Zul'aman, you can get it by using the [item=33865] on frogs in Zul'aman. (You won't get the pet everytime, it's a rare loot)<br />

Btw, I think you should start to link LFG comics again. It seem they are back to their &quot;simple-mind&quot; content with http://www.lfgcomic.com/page/89</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand I don't how I should feel about this kind of buff: That's a +45% movement speed outdoors with the feral talent. I think mobility was never a druid problem... rather it's a problem for other (melee) classes to keep up with a druid.<br />
<br />
But then, I never played a druid at 70 myself ^^'</div></div><hr />

Not sure about druids but i know the pally talent that increases movement speed doesnt stack with anything else. I'm guessing the same is true here.</div></div><hr />
