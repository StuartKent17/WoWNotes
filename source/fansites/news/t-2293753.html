Yea, the maze seems to not only loop, but have multiple levels. Personally I just gave up trying to map it at some point and went yolo.</div></div><hr />

There was a boss where you had to go through the maze, which kept leading you in circles. I thought of the area like that Zelda game. if 2 corridors are blocked off on the east and west, you are moving through the rings of the circle to get to a new inner or outer circle. <br />
<br />
Once you realize this, the maze becomes trivial imo. <br />
<br />
Basically, I started the maze at the same time a guildie did. I had to leave for a while to go have dinner with the family. I came back, logged in, finished the maze and my guildie was still on it!</div></div><hr />

I can't tell you about hearthing, but my game crashed while I was working on my 4th orb. Fortunately, when I logged back in, my character still had the blue orb debuff and I was able to continue where I left off.</div></div><hr />

I can confirm it does save progress. What I'm not sure about though is hearthing if you have an orb debuff on you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Took me a little under 4 hours with mapping because of random teleports. I have a really hard time believing it took you 15 minutes just due to how it mechanically works.<br />
<br />
Also it took celestalon almost 3 hours.</div></div><hr />

Was mine. I wasted about 20 mins just running in circles because I was being bored. But also, druid, so cat form did make it a bit faster. I had 0 &quot;random teleports&quot;.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Now looking at someone else's map in the other thread about this. Holy crap, was I lucky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I mean by random teleports is that I went through a doorway and when I came out on the other side I had rocks behind me meaning it didn't just bring me to the next room it placed me into another random room, or loops that brought to unexpected parts of the map. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying you're lying, I'm just saying you got absurdly lucky.<br />
<br />
As an example this is Celestalons map, you can see many loops in his.<br />

Ahh, okay. I see what you mean. I had 1 of those just to the east of blue orb if I went north. I intentionally avoided it because of that problem.</div></div><hr />

They do not go to 0, meaning 0 isn't part of the answer. 1222176597 is what should be input.</div></div><hr />

I'm telling you. It's a pattern. All you have to do is look at the whole thing as a gigantic circle and pay attention to what corridors are blocked.</div></div><hr />

Then why did it take one of the game devs almost 3 hours? With a map that looked like this?<br />

<br />
Which dev? Again, there is no map you can follow. I spent the most amount of time looking for the damn purple brazier and getting it to the purple rune. I passed the blue rune twice looking. Once I passed that blue rune twice, I realized I was traveling in a circle and made a turn north to move further in. Once I found that north turn, it turned into rooms blocked on the east and west 2/3 rooms in a row. Then it opened. Once I went through, I kept traveling to the right. I arrived at purple rune. <br />
<br />
It's a circle. Watch the way the rooms are blocked and you'll get the overall picture.</div></div><hr />

I've completed it, I don't need tips, I understand it's different for everyone, my point is you got really good rng. The map refutes your strategy, I'm not posting it because I think it's something I can follow.<br />

I can confirm that hearthing and rezoning does not reset the progress or the 'map' you will continue where you left of and are spawning in the same room as you started.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure which image you're looking at, but there's one image that is very misleading because the lights that are supposed to be lit are black and the lights that are supposed to be left unlit are blue.<br />

This is a part of a very makeshift map I drew while doing this and I can tell you I had no problem backtracking from the red rune to the green orb without a single error, and that was at least 15 rooms in terms of distance. The rooms you get are not random, the layout very well may be, but the rooms themselves are just where you left them if you know where you went.</div></div><hr />

Its totally mapable, without pen and paper its gonna take you a long time. I used pen and paper and it worked perfectly. Got lost only on last rune, because you cant tell anymore where you've been, and i might failed at mapping</div></div><hr />

This is a part of a very makeshift map I drew while doing this and I can tell you I had no problem backtracking from the red rune to the green orb without a single error, and that was at least 15 rooms in terms of distance. The rooms you get are not random, the layout very well may be, but the rooms themselves are just where you left them if you know where you went.<br />
<br />
Ok, clearly I triggered you. But according to your &quot;map&quot; you have areas marked exactly as I said in my first post. I stated that I treated this like a giant circle where pathways seemed to go to different areas of the circle and I noticed this by areas of the map (rooms?) were blocked west and east by boulders. After seeing this, I knew I was entering a new area. Looking at your makeshift map, I see the patterns.<br />
<br />
Yeesh, people still triggered a week later over this shit. Go to bed lol.</div></div><hr />

Have you even been in there? There are multiple levels, achieved through the miracle of stairs. Of course, the real explanation is that the exits port you around to different areas that aren't physically connected. The point is these aren't generated at random all the time, once a room has been visited it will be saved, allowing people to draw maps and backtrack while also ensuring the maze is different for everyone.</div></div><hr />

That's the beauty of a randomly generated maze, it can take you anywhere between 2 minutes to 2 hours depending on which rooms you get. Brute forcing it could lead you to running in circles though, in my run I ended up back at the room with purple orbs when I had been moving away from it for a long time, but once I found myself back there I was able to follow what I had mapped earlier to find my way back to the rune, at which point running around randomly might have been hard since most rooms around that rune had already been generated. That last bit is why I recommend people map it, you could at any time end up somewhere you've been before and that could help you out a lot in terms of finding your way where you want to go from there.</div></div><hr />

The plaque on the back of the chair is the clue. You need to stand in front of the chair with the Shadoweave Mask on in order to interact with the skull, read the inconspicuous note and advance to the next step.</div></div><hr />

If... you have the mask on, and the skull wont interact with you, a simple /reload should fix it, it did for me. Some people said they had to zone into the cavern with the mask on to work, so there is also that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
D'oh ok... sorry still waiting on coffee to brew. For the Ulduar part, I found that doing the Central Cross 1st, then each flourish in the corner was easiest for me. keep it simple. Started in 1 corner, counted over 7 empty lights, then clicked the next 6. then painted that whole swath green. the did the same for the other arm going across. Then for the Flourishes in the corner I looked at the example found out which light is the closest to the outside, and made the Diagonal Line, then painted into the Corner of the cross section.</div></div><hr />

This is a part of a very makeshift map I drew while doing this and I can tell you I had no problem backtracking from the red rune to the green orb without a single error, and that was at least 15 rooms in terms of distance. The rooms you get are not random, the layout very well may be, but the rooms themselves are just where you left them if you know where you went.<br />
<br />
I could only go to the green rune from one direction. I mapped it out. When i got to the green rune and went down down i ended up at blue. Which was my starting reference. If i went up up from blue. I was at a completly different location. No where near green. So green could only be achieved by going one way So there are random teleports inbetween some of the rooms.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
People make mistakes, and if there are thousands involved, the numbers will rack up. The maze is determined once you step in, going the same way will always lead you to the same room. Always. It is impossible to change the maze in any form. There are cycles, yes, and thus multiple/unlimited ways to the same target, but there is no possibilty for a changing way. Moving north and then east is not the same as moving east and then north. Backtracking. Always. Works. Torches are extinguished once you click them until you click another torch or lose the buff otherwise (though someone said they are reignited after an hour or something).<br />
<br />
I have had 4 t-sections arranged in a square which is a nightmare for mapping/detecting cycles, but it is possible. The most valuable clues for a cycle are long straight ways.</div></div><hr />

It did happen. I even backtracked before grabbing the orb to make sure I went the correct way while making the map to prevent any &quot;mistakes&quot; and it was perfect. I grabbed the orb and when I went back out the way I came, the side I had entered in the previous room was blocked off. But it what it is, it got done in the end.</div></div><hr />

To be honest if it wasn't for the random teleports and looping halls I think it would have been pretty fun.

100% mappable. Stop spreading this misinformation. I followed back on parts of it multiple times on my map and it was exactly as it should be. It's just more than 2 dimensional. There's effectively multiple &quot;floors&quot;.

<br />
Well, the idea of multiple floors is misleading, because one of the exits is a staircase. I'd say the rooms aren't necessarily adjacent, but there are hallways connecting them. That's why going east, then south, then west and then north doesn't usually lead you to the same room you were in. But going south, then east, then north, then west would indeed return you to it.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes you can, you just draw a line connecting one end to the other. Or writte a letter indicating those rooms connect through that door, like some others have done in a spreadsheet.</div></div><hr />

Hence, why I put it in quotes. Go backwards will still put you to where you were in the previous room, so it might as well be considered floors for the sake of explanations.</div></div><hr />

Moving east and then north is different from moving north and then east, so in a 2d map different rooms would share the same tile. Even without cycles, it's not mappable. You can map sections of the map, but never the whole map.</div></div><hr />

<br />
https://i.imgur.com/WxCyPsA.jpg<br />
<br />
So in this example, room 5 is the culprit. Going South in this room is no problem, but every time I'd have to go West in a situation like this, I'd basically treat it as a new floor, since there was every possibility that the next room would let me go North... Which should be impossible with the South exit from room 3 blocked.<br />
<br />
The best thing you can do, though, is to map EVERYTHING before you touch any of the orbs, so that you don't lose what few landmarks you have. Once I found all the torches and altars, it was a simple matter of retracing my steps and avoiding any of the screwy parts I'd found along the way.</div></div><hr />

once you are done with a color, it does not give it to you again, which is why you can safely reset the map and go.<br />

It shouldn't reset. It just clears the orbs/rune so you don't have a point of reference anymore. The layout stayed identical for me all the way through till turning in the final orb.</div></div><hr />

Brute forcing it could lead you to running in circles though, in my run I ended up back at the room with purple orbs when I had been moving away from it for a long time, but once I found myself back there I was able to follow what I had mapped earlier to find my way back to the rune, at which point running around randomly might have been hard since most rooms around that rune had already been generated. That last bit is why I recommend people map it, you could at any time end up somewhere you've been before and that could help you out a lot in terms of finding your way where you want to go from there.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I've been hearing about people spending hours upon hours in there. It sucks. I guess I did get lucky. But thankfully in my case, I just noticed a pattern right away and used it. As of right now, one of my guildies is still in there and it's been about 45 min.</div></div><hr />

As someone that was on for 12 hours a day since Tuesday participating on this discord, experiencing all of the excitement, frustration, and sheer adventure, I have to say you are BEYOND wrong. This riddle quest was the most fun I've had on WoW since the last time I played seriously in 2009. Plus I have no idea what the hell you mean by 'they' when it's a PUBLIC discord open to everyone. I was a complete random. Secret Discord is referring to nothing more than a meeting place for the ENTIRE WoW community. It's not some secret club. You have absolutely no idea the HUNDREDS of different directions everyone took to solve each and every riddle, eventually narrowing possibilities now. After this experience, I now know what it's like to have participated in being one of those first people putting in the work to figure and discover stuff that'll be put into a guide that the 99% of other players will just google, copy, and complain about being 'too hard' or 'rigged'.<br />

If you find something you can go back following the very same steps and you will always find what you marked. <br />
<br />
Let's say that on step 29 you found the red rune table, and on the step 54 you found the red orb, just go back following the same step order until you reach 29 again and that's it, go with the next orb.<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
1. If you move to a room and you see rocks behind you, you got teleported and you must reset the map.<br />
2. Yes, even if you found let's say a purple orb on step 19, you could still find the same purple orb on step 75, even if it's a different square.

They did discovered nothing, let's stop pretending, the truth is like Kosumoth and like EVERY similar puzzle, they had heay clues from the devs.<br />
Simply look at all the tasks you need to do, NO ONE has sense, NO ONE has link to each other, exactly like the Kosumoth puzzle, please, stop pretending they hard work to find the answer when EVERY single step of the puzzle has NOTHING to do with the next, and EVERY step is 100% NON-SENSE and isn't even related to the puzzle itself.<br />
<br />
It's remind me of a time hen i was on a private realm who organized regular events with riddles, enigmas and treasure hunting. EVERY time, it was the same 4 people who were finding the solution, hours before every other (and there was many people who participated), every time they claimed they had to work hard to find the answer.<br />
You want to know the truth? In fact, those 4 people were close friends of the co-organisator, and he was giving them all the answers before the event were officialy set, when the event was launched, they had just to sit and wait, then, head straight to the place were the treasure was, the only difficulty was to wait enough time so the other people didn't suspect they were cheating.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Secret Discord&quot; is exactly like this: they already know the answer, because the dev told them, they didn't find anything, they just lie by pretending they work hard, in fact, they knew from the very beginning what to do and in what order.<br />
<br />

Just because you can't do it doesn't mean it doesn't belong in the game. It exists for like 3 of the hundreds of obtainable mounts.<br />

It's nice to see some variety on how to obtain mounts imo.<br />

Speak for yourself. Figuring out the maze was very rewarding, almost up there with beating the guardian druid mage tower challenge (though not nearly as time-consuming). I wish there was more stuff like this in the game, but I can appreciate that it probably takes a good deal of time to develop for something people are going to do a grand total of once.</div></div><hr />

The colours part is easy, it's the randomised map that you happen to get that can be the problem. Some people get fairly brute-forcable maps with little to no looping, depths or tricks, other people get convoluted labyrinths that have multiple looping traps and layers.</div></div><hr />

Pro-tip. Once you've got an orb don't abandon it like I did. I picked up a red orb, found a green orb, picked that up which removed the red buff and then in the next room I found a red rune...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have been teleported back a large number of times then. <br />
<br />
The maze is not that big so for you to be getting those numbers you are getting ported back to a point in the maze you already know. This is why it has been suggested that you leave all the orbs and runes alone until you have mapped out all 5 colours so that you can use them as reference for when you have been ported back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My last orb, the blue on was a nightmare. <br />
<br />
In my attempt to map it, after going straight north for about 40 rooms i got back to the starting point. It really made no sense, considering i crossed 8 rooms with ladders going up.<br />
Around 4hrs with some breaks from time to time.<br />
<br />
As usual the hint is not to map the whole place, it wouldn't work, but keep track of the steps you made to get from a particular orb to its own rune.</div></div><hr />

1. Do not activate any of the runes until you have found the location of all runes and orbs, the runes and orbs will help orient yourself in the maze.<br />
2. Once you've found all of them, work from the outside in (the most isolated orb etc)<br />

Makes it a lot easier. My map went from hundreds of rooms to 20-30 because if I got disoriented, the runes and orbs were a good marker to reorient.</div></div><hr />

Just a note - if you did complete as you went and got stuck on a last one - eventually the runes (but not the orbs - your progress is safe) will respawn, giving you 4 waypoints back in the case that you're stuck on the last.<br />

No, it even keeps your last debuff applied to your character. You may get disoriented in general though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Use &quot;Large Paper&quot;<br />
<br />
- Let each room be a 3x3 square. You won't use the corner boxes of those squares, just the N, S, E, W and center boxes.<br />
<br />
- Fill in the corresponding N, S, E, W box with Orange for a path and Black for blockade. If there's a rune or orb, fill in the center box of that 3x3 square with the color of the rune or orb.<br />
<br />
Tips:<br />
- Remember orient yourself by putting your back to the south exit/blockade. You'll know which one that is because there's stairs and you'll face the altar and the torches will be in front of it.<br />
- As you map your grid, if you realize you're about to butt an Orange entrance against a Black blockade, then don't go thru that entrance. If you do, it will teleport you to a random part of the maze.<br />
- Sometimes, no matter what, you'll get teleported to a random part of the maze anyway. If so, stop and look at the room and look at your map, try to see if you can match the entrance/exit pattern with your map. If there's more than one possibility, pick an entrance and go thru it, then match up that room and the previous room with your map.<br />
- If you get into a string (3 or more in a row) of straight rooms (N/S or E/W) you're probably (but not always) headed in the wrong direction.</div></div><hr />

This is the best advice here - find them all first while you have the flames and runes up as waypoints. I mapped it all using Google Sheets leaving these up, took about 45mins in total with only 1 colour being a bit of a nightmare (35 rooms away from its rune)</div></div><hr />

2. Use cardinal points for better orientation.<br />
3. Remember, the Earth is flat but the maze is not.<br />
4. If you are lost (which probably will be true a few times), start new map but do not forget your previous job.<br />
5. If you find a sphere or rune try to check all available directions because what you seek can be in the next room.<br />
6. Do not start the maze if you have not up to 3 hours of spare time and be patient.<br />

<br />
- as already said, do not clik anything until you have mapped all 10 orbs/runes.<br />
- remember the rooms are not next to each other: running in circle won't necessarely take you back.<br />
- you have to understand that if you take a &quot;&quot;wrong&quot;&quot; direction, you will be teleported randomly. Which at first make it really random to draw a map.<br />
- when you find one of the 10, try to link it to another one AND WHEN YOU DO, do it the other way to see if it still works. IF IT DOES, WRIGHT THAT SHIT DOWN.<br />
- and then repeat until you have found everything (always do it both ways to make sure you weren't randomly teleported in the process)<br />
<br />
finally, to avoid an heart attack, as I did, when you have done all the 5 colours, go in any direction to be teleported to the scroll :)<br />
<br />
Hope it helps. Remember that in the end, once you avoid &quot;wrong teleporting door&quot;, the map is more simple than first anticipated.<br />
(didn't used the addon. It's tremendous work from the team, but I think it can confuse more)<br />

<br />
Simply look at all the tasks you need to do, NO ONE has sense, NO ONE has link to each other, exactly like the Kosumoth puzzle, please, stop pretending they hard work to find the answer when EVERY single step of the puzzle has NOTHING to do with the next, and EVERY step is 100% NON-SENSE and isn't even related to the puzzle itself.<br />
<br />
Can be true... but maybe 30-40k ppl working together can do/experiment/think more than one person alone??<br />

<br />
It's remind me of a time hen i was on a private realm who organized regular events with riddles, enigmas and treasure hunting. EVERY time, it was the same 4 people who were finding the solution, hours before every other (and there was many people who participated), every time they claimed they had to work hard to find the answer.<br />
You want to know the truth? In fact, those 4 people were close friends of the co-organisator, and he was giving them all the answers before the event were officialy set, when the event was launched, they had just to sit and wait, then, head straight to the place were the treasure was, the only difficulty was to wait enough time so the other people didn't suspect they were cheating.<br />
<br />
It probably really depends how venal administrators are. Alot of private servers are just p2w.<br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;Secret Discord&quot; is exactly like this: they already know the answer, because the dev told them, they didn't find anything, they just lie by pretending they work hard, in fact, they knew from the very beginning what to do and in what order.<br />

<br />
My experience is this:<br />
1 Find a rune. In my case, it was the blue, but it doesn't matter. any rune is fine. This is now your starting point. Now just walk one direction and map out each room you visit. I made a map of squares. putting a x on blocked paths and a line on the path i took into a new square. I kept going til i found a rune or torch and marked it. Every time i came back to the blue rune i knew that way was done. then i walked the same way. Same direction but not i took another direction in the first room that split into two. The opposit of the first traversal. Then kept mapping it out. When i got to place wich teleported you. then i marked that route as a false route. It doesnt take you anywhere. found my way back to the blue and started over. Did this til i had explored more or less all possible ways to go and eventualy i had my scroll.<br />
<br />
The key is to keep walking one direction. Because i want to the left of the blue. Went really long and got to the green rune. Went down twice and ended up at the blue. If i walked up twice at the blue. i was at a complete different place. No green rune.<br />
<br />
So find a central pont. A rune or a torch. Keep that point til the last. If you find the torch for your rune. Mark it down. Don't use it and make it dissapear. Walk the same direction all the time. You will almost always end up back at your rune. so walk one way til you find the same rune. walk the same way but take another direction at a cross til you end up at the same rune. on the way you will eventualy find all the others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There were only like 40 rooms max. What happens is sometimes you get teleported to a different room...which can turn out to be a room you've already been in. I doubt the addon takes this into account. There was one area of my map where I could basically run forever without seeing more than 6-7 different rooms because of the way I'd be getting warped in a circle. Once I figured that out, I made sure to avoid that area like the plague.<br />
<br />
The simplest thing I can think of is to treat it like the &quot;enigmatic&quot; world quests (where there's always going to be a space of one block between rows. NEVER double back on your route unless you absolutely have to, and if you do, treat it like you've gone to a different floor and start mapping it separately until you come to a landmark you've already seen before.<br />
<br />
https://i.imgur.com/sJoBBb1.jpg<br />
My map. As you can see, the green torch (GT) room can be reached by going 3 different directions from the yellow torch (YT) room...because there are a couple warps around GT that will really screw you up if you aren't paying attention.<br />
<br />
One thing that helped me with the map was basically assuming that every room with 3 directions open was next to a potential warp.<br />
<br />
https://i.imgur.com/WxCyPsA.jpg<br />
<br />
Here, room 5 is the culprit. Going South in this room is no problem, but every time I'd have to go West in a situation like this (what I meant when I said never double back on your route), I'd basically treat it as a new floor, since there was every possibility that the next room would let me go North... Which should be impossible with the South exit from room 3 blocked.<br />
<br />
The best thing you can do, though, is to map EVERYTHING before you touch any of the orbs, so that you don't lose what few landmarks you have. Once I found all the torches and altars, it was a simple matter of retracing my steps and avoiding any of the screwy parts I'd found along the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you get a light to the right place: it resets. using the addon I strongly suggest you reset the map in the addon.<br />
once you are done with a color, it does not give it to you again, which is why you can safely reset the map and go.<br />
<br />
I spent close to 2 hours in it before I figured this out.<br />
<br />
This is incorrect. My map never reset or changed.<br />

While your progress seems to be saved for a certain amount of time if you leave, eventually it does completely reset. I started yesterday morning, dug out my graph paper and put all my old map skills to work from the days before automap. I located all the torches and altars except the blue altar, searched for over three hours then gave up and ported out to Dalaran. Came back several hours later and the torches/altars had reset, however, it was the exact same maze as before. Again I used my map to get through it, and again I couldn't find the blue altar. I was afraid I was &quot;locked&quot; into a maze where the blue altar was missing or blocked by teleports or something. However, when I tried this morning, the maze was totally different (and much easier) four of the five torches were within roughly a 5 x 5 area, using this as my &quot;home area&quot; I worked my way out and (relatively) easily located the altars. The entire thing took maybe 90 minutes (then I spent another 45 minutes trying to find the mount in the Karazan Catacombs because I didn't realize there was path to a lower level, but that was my own fault....).<br />
<br />
My guess:<br />
<br />
Progress Resets if you leave for ~2 Hours.<br />
Entire maze changes ~24 hours.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">De Lupe</div><div class="date">2017-09-04, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys - do NOT make a map, the rooms are not necessarily next to eachother. Here's your golden rule - simply record your route between landmarks, e.g.<br />
<br />
Red Torch: Right, Down, Right, Down : Purple Rune<br />
Purple Rune:	Down, Down, Right, Down, Down	: Yellow Torch<br />
Yellow Torch:	Left, Up, Left : Blue Rune<br />
Yellow Rune:	Left, Up, Up, Right : Purple Torch<br />
Purple Torch:	Right, Right, Right, Right, Right : Green Rune<br />
<br />
Once you've done that enough you'll create a daisy-chain you can follow through the maze. Remember that runes disappear once you've cleared them so don't get confused.<br />
<br />
Using this method I completed the maze in around 35 minutes.<br />
<br />
Hate to break it to you mate...but you made a map.</div></div><hr />

I struggled with the maze (as many others). My map making skills were working in my own little way and I had only red left when I had to leave for reasons. Logged back in and the maze remained the same but the rest of the colours reset. But I was able to redo my previous map as I got a little lost and without the colours there it was much harder. <br />
<br />
I made sure I located every orb and rune this time, THEN went around and put them where they should. As long as you give yourself something coherent to follow it becomes much easier :)</div></div><hr />

You'll still have to remember if the rooms had more than 1 open path other than the way you entered. For my &quot;final attempt&quot; I had pretty much remembered key features of my maze, I think for my final attempt before I finished it, I never hit a loop or &quot;edge&quot;, also leaving torches/runes to use as landmarks until I had them all mapped kinda helped.<br />
<br />
<br />
But damn did it throw me off when I went back to the same X/Y location as an earlier room and it was different, that really sealed that rooms can be &quot;above or below&quot;.</div></div><hr />

There is only one red orb, so you found the same room four times. Which means you only saw 30 rooms.</div></div><hr />

My biggest complaint is that the match 3 puzzle solved itself as soon as i clicked on the thing.<br />
The Endless Halls was my favorite part, although it took me like 4 hours. I mapped the entire thing out though, so that may be the reason it took so long (also an internet crash in the middle)<br />
<br />
This is my map:<br />
http://imgur.com/a/bY6xe<br />
67 rooms, 6 pairs of warp doors, 2 warp doors with a random exit and 2 dead ends.<br />
<br />
Tips for making the map:<br />
-As many have already said, don't pair the orbs to the runes before you have explored the place.<br />
<br />
-Don't make just one map. I made several smaller sections that I later combined into the large final map. <br />
<br />
-Backtrack. If you find a point of interest and then leave, go back to the point just to see if you can go back. If you can you have a fixed part of the map. If you can't then you know that you wnt through a random warp door. You can also go back through any door to see if they lead to the same place you just left.<br />
<br />
- Most importantly: Don't run around randomly. The placement of the rooms may appear random, but they aren't, so just running around like a headless chicken will most likely end up with you being even more lost.</div></div><hr />

-The C'thun minigame requires you to put 5 Yogg brains in a row. Do that and you win. You win only by doing that.<br />
-Do not map the labyrinth. Run straight, and if the uppermost exit is covered with rubble, go right. If both are covered, go to the only exit left. If you feel like you're finding the same rooms over and over, break the sequence.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if it's my terrible mapping skills but it still took hours even with trying to map the place (not helped by constantly finding myself hitting the top of an a4 page and realising it had wrapped around when I found a marker I had already been in before (thank you yellow flame room for being my guide!) For my final (blue orb hand-in) I went on instinct as I had noticed that to get to the blue alter there was a long series of north bound hallways compared to the others, so when I finally found the blue flames to grab the orb I kept going east and north until I hit a 6+ rooms that only went north until it ended then headed east twice to find the blue alter again. Never been so relieved to finish a puzzle in my life.<br />

for anyone on maze 1 small advice. use pen and paper and map the maze with all the orbs and runes. then backtrack. took me 2 hours without any addon just a piece of paper. if you wanna go back to the start just relog fast. dont HS or teleport just log out and log in and you're back to start</div></div><hr />

The maze is easiest if you map it. If you are lost move any direction and map it until you see its similarity to what you mapped before... then just try follow map to find a mark. When you find it you are back on track.</div></div><hr />

They did discovered nothing, let's stop pretending, the truth is like Kosumoth and like EVERY similar puzzle, they had heay clues from the devs.<br />
Simply look at all the tasks you need to do, NO ONE has sense, NO ONE has link to each other, exactly like the Kosumoth puzzle, please, stop pretending they hard work to find the answer when EVERY single step of the puzzle has NOTHING to do with the next, and EVERY step is 100% NON-SENSE and isn't even related to the puzzle itself.<br />
<br />
It's remind me of a time hen i was on a private realm who organized regular events with riddles, enigmas and treasure hunting. EVERY time, it was the same 4 people who were finding the solution, hours before every other (and there was many people who participated), every time they claimed they had to work hard to find the answer.<br />
You want to know the truth? In fact, those 4 people were close friends of the co-organisator, and he was giving them all the answers before the event were officialy set, when the event was launched, they had just to sit and wait, then, head straight to the place were the treasure was, the only difficulty was to wait enough time so the other people didn't suspect they were cheating.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Secret Discord&quot; is exactly like this: they already know the answer, because the dev told them, they didn't find anything, they just lie by pretending they work hard, in fact, they knew from the very beginning what to do and in what order.<br />
<br />
haha, wow, someone is extremely salty because he isn't smart!<br />

Please do tell how the clues are not leading to the next puzzle. Will be an interesting read for sure.</div></div><hr />

I'm not spreading lies. I won right after putting 5 brains in a row, and I'm 100% sure of that because I'd been trying for 10 minutes. The moment it happened I won. Maybe I should specify they were located horizontally.<br />
I tried to map the maze and ended up frustrated, so I started following the tactic I wrote and I was out of there in about 1 hour.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorejira</div><div class="date">2017-09-05, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I have to say, that the maze map helper add on.....DID NOT help me. It couldn't detect when you teleport looped, and instead made it a whole new room, which only confused me more. When I had tried it the first time, I got overwhelmed, confused and lost and I feel the addon only added to my stress. (this is my experience. Others may find the addon helpful). So I gave up after an hour and a half of feeling like I was going in circles.<br />
Yesterday, boyfriend helped me. I shared screen with him via skype, he had graph paper and mapped out my paths for me. (He loves maps and making them, so he was more than happy to help my stupid, overwhelmed butt ;-; ) <br />
So we took it slow and calmly, going to each room, seeing what was blocked and which directions were open, and we figured out where there was teleport loops, and so on.<br />
We would mainly go into a south to north path until we couldn't and went the only way open, and so on. Eventually got the whole map mapped out, dead ends, loops, teleport loops and all. At that point, he didn't even need to look at my screen and could tell me which ways to turn (N, S, E, W) just by looking at his graph map and we completed the runes smoothly from there. Starting at the orbs farthest from their rune and going to the last one which was only a couple rooms away. <br />
So for me, we found using paper, pen and color pencils to be more efficient than the addon.<br />
Total time, it took us about 2 and a half to 3 hours. But we were slow moving, as well as being completion perfectionist and wanted to have the whole thing mapped out, even if we knew where all the orbs and runes were haha. So it may have only taken at max 2ish hours if we weren't being so cautious and wanting to figure out the whole map layout.<br />
<br />
And YES the map DOES completely reset if you hearth and log off and come back hours later. <br />
Cause my first attempt, I started at about midnight left around 1:44 am with having (stupidly and not realizing) completed one rune. I had combined the red orb and rune on my first attempt before I realized I had made a terrible mistake with that. And when I went back to the map with the bf, it was 11pm the following day, and everything was reset, even the red orb and rune.</div></div><hr />

when I first started the maze, I was in a room with the blue orb, took the orb, ran around mapping things out. I then came to the altar and clicked it. During that time, I failed to record what rooms those were in. After that, the orb and altar room looked like every other room.<br />
<br />
Until about 2 hours that is, then magically all of the altars that I had activated came back (not the orbs) so I was able to add them as frame of references. I then worked on the last two colors and finished the maze. So after a while, the altar colors do come back.<br />

For the AQ40 part, I was in a group with a friend, I started before him and was playing it for 10-15 minutes. He comes in, starts it up and gets a 5 in a row (not sure if it was brains or not) and gets the note. I keep playing, and get a different 5 in a row and it did nothing. Eventually, I kept playing and make an L (3 vertical, 3 horizontal, but different &quot;jewels&quot;) and it popped and I got the note.</div></div><hr />

Some fools in general chat will try to convince you that you NEVER did the runes cuz you apparently have memory problems and eyesight issues. Disregard them, the runes respawn but your progress is saved anyway, you don't need to match them to an orb again.</div></div><hr />

I did pencil and paper (remember pencil, you can erase that...) But realize it is not just a two dimensional maze, it has levels, so I had to use multiple pieces of paper to help figure some things out. The map helper doesn't work with that, but it at least helps with some stuff. I had fun with colored pencils and what not to point from one door to another being things didn't line up right.</div></div><hr />

The mapping itself is terrible, but it basically records every &quot;step&quot; you make with increasing room numbers, so it is good to backtrack. DO NOT use it in the following way &quot;well, the yellow rune room is to the left from here, I am gonna start turning left whenever I can&quot; cuz you'll just get lost and that mapping makes no sense, doesn't take floors into account, etc. Literally walk your way back from room 631 to 630 to 629... all the way to 324 if necessary. It's the only real use for the addon.</div></div><hr />

It's really only useful for backtracking. You'll get to a point when you have to reset the map every so often, like when you get back to the same color room but the map shows it on the opposite corner. So it's helpful to a point but not much more than using a pen and paper.</div></div><hr />

However, thinking that the maze was resetting itself I continued to match colours whenever I could and voila! I was spat out and there was my note.<br />
<br />
If you're getting frustrated trying to map, thinking it is resetting, I would suggest making any match you can while you're running around.</div></div><hr />

if i count from left to right or right to left 7 off bulbs and the 8th bulb is on then i end up with 6 on bulbs in the middle where the picture shows 7<br />
<br />
You're counting wrong then.<br />
The lights are in a square, 20x20 lights. If you take the entire outer row, it should be 7 off, 6 on, 7 off (7+6+7 = 20). <br />
It's not rocket science, you just need to read the guide correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You won't. That is the point of the maze. Basically, you go through a room and keep traversing, you eventually enter a room you have already been to (i.e. an altar or orb). You then take a step back and look at your maze.<br />
<br />
What I discovered, is that the last 10 rooms I was just in I had already mapped (if you sort of place the rooms on top of each other and see the pattern). So then I find the place that is not consistent with what I had already discovered. That entrance/exit is the teleport spot.<br />
<br />
So I mark it and move on. It actually is a breath of fresh air when you can close off a &quot;loop&quot;. Because you are one step closer to finishing the maze then.</div></div><hr />

Luck happens, i tried doing what people said but none of it worked so i just kept playing... and at some point it just finished, no real solution that i could notice... just flipped one into a match of 3 and somehow it finished. :o<br />
<br />
The maze is pure luck if you try following a specific pattern, youll end up spending more time there than if you just mapped it and knew the layout.<br />
What i and many many people did was map everything until you found the orbs and runes, once you did that STOP... hammer time, then just turn them in without going off your map. Exploring new areas at that point would be worthless since you already have a map that you can follow to get it done.</div></div><hr />

I can guarantee you, it's the five brains in a row. Not four, not three. As I said, I spent 10 minutes there trying to accommodate in order to have 2 brains-a random tile-2 brains, and an incoming brain for the random tile, all horizontally. In that time I experimented all sort of combinations, often unwillingly, including chaining 5 non-brain things. The game registered as complete the exact moment the five brains were matched. Nothing else apart from those brains popped at that time, and so, nothing else could have made me win the minigame apart from that. Unless there's something like a X turns limit where you win after a certain time regardless of score and combination, but that seems extremely unlikely, even more if it just came to happen randomly when the combo was made.<br />
<br />
With regards to the labyrinth, it sure is pure luck. The tactic I used worked like a charm because yes, I was running wild across the halls, but I was quick to realise if I was running in circles. As soon as I figured out I was visiting the same places, I took crazy turns and strayed away. I remember the last one I missed was purple. As soon as I found the rune I started mapping again, only to get lost and frustrated. So I started running wild again. 10 minutes later I found the orb and once more the rune.</div></div><hr />

The only reason i dont believe that brain theory is because i did it too... 5 brains in row, nothing happened. :P <br />
<br />
But it doesnt matter, its probably the easiest puzzle in the whole thing... the chair was funniest and im glad theres the maze, no real answer to that one so everyone has to do it themselves one way or another.<br />
They should make another mount puzzle with only puzzles that you cant have a definite answer to... that way people cant just &quot;wait&quot; for others to figure it out and then reap the rewards. Maze is one of those kind of things but its the only one.</div></div><hr />

Another possible trigger could be &quot;set 5 different objects in a row for X times&quot;. That would fit with my experience and possibly yours, if your game closed when putting 5 things in a row (not necessarily brains).<br />
I agree puzzles are cool but they shouldn't be too randomized. The way it's set up now, secret hunters enjoy themselves finding the solution, and the rest of the playerbase enjoys following the trail. If you set it up assuming everyone is a secret hunter, very few will actually try and get it, and they'd possibly complain.<br />

You dont need to be a secret hunter to be able to do the maze... the thing that hunters need to do is find the damn thing first. :P<br />
Then the other playerbase has easy time finding it and the only thing they need to do is follow instructions on how to do it and they can do it.<br />
<br />
The maze isnt THAT difficult unless you are lazy... mapping it is piece of cake. <br />
<br />
These mounts being behind puzzles is cool an all, but sometimes it could be something else... we already have 300+ mounts and you can only ride one.<br />
Having something like a cosmetic weapon transmog would be cooler... something unique like oldschool legendaries, since the vanity of legendaries have been destroyed aswell... would be nice to get something that replaces it.<br />
<br />
We need unique things walled behind effort/skill or guild effort. The artifact challenges are good but theres only 1 per class and some dont fit well to class fantasy, or personal preference. Something that everyone can use would be nice... mounts are getting old since we have so many. :D<br />
<br />
Before transmog system the gear you saw people wear showed their achievements, CM-gear is one too but its no longer obtainable so meh.<br />
We need something to replace those that dont exist in the game anymore. <br />
Even the oldschool priest staff Anathema/Benediction and hunter bow/staff-quests dont exist anymore so people cant go and work on those.<br />
<br />
I wish they implement something... brawlers guild is cool and all but it has no rewards. Done it once = got title, heirlooms, not much else to even get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Otaka and I have already moved past that point in our discussion further down. As I said, in my experience it could have only be the brains. Maybe you just need a random thing to be 5 in a row, maybe there's a pool of triggers and players may experiment different things. Maybe there's a timer (unlikely). But as it stands, as I said, I can guarantee that was what made me win it.</div></div><hr />
