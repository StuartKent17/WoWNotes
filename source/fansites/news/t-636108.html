<meta name="description" content="Ulduar - Weapon Models Preview 
You probably noticed yesterday that I didn't post any weapon model screenshot, it took a bit longer than expected to get them done but I think it was definitely worth the wait. Below are most of the new weapon models added to the game for Ulduar Raid, for each model you will find most of the skin recolors available in the game files and it should be a fairly accurate preview of what you will see in game. (Except maybe for a few bugged light effects on my side)

Note on Val'anyr, Gavel of Ancient Kings: According to its file name, the model of Val'anyr, Gavel of Ancient Kings (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/february/valanyr.jpg) is here but actually looks even better in game. (Just wait a few more hours and you will have a chance to see it in action (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/february/kickasspaladin.jpg))<br />

Would be fail if its only for casters. If you can choose between tank, dps or caster version, then it's allowed<br />
to be called a legendary imo.<br />

The basic stuff and the amazing staves is what pulls this whole batch of item models up to barely acceptable. Being a tank I really hope that the sword and shield you linked to will be tanking items - they certainly have the look for it.<br />
Aside from the staves all of the more elaborate designs are absolute shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By that logic, Sulfuras, Thunderfury, Warglaives and Thoridal are not legendaries, as you cannot choose alternate versions of the weapon. Your reasoning seems pretty silly, along the lines of &quot;If it's not for my spec, it ain't legendary&quot;. At least as a Shaman you CAN use it, unlike us poor Mages and Locks left out in the cold again :(<br />
<br />
As for the other weapons, overall pretty average. Expecting a little more, you know, variety. Not just pole with red line, sword with red line, dagger with red line etc.</div></div><hr />

Lets just w8 what they will bring<br />

I love fist weapons, but for some reason these dont appeal, so back to the drawing board for them<br />

Weapons who are &quot;shattered&quot; and held together by the force or lightning or some other stuff just belong back in Outland, not in the &quot;norse mythology&quot; world of Northrend.<br />

<br />
Ye, i'm kinda hoping these aren't all we will see as the weapons from the above post did look VERY good. A lot less bland than this lot. I can see the direction they are taking but &quot;power&quot; weapons can look a hell of a lot better than these. <br />
<br />
From a rogue point of view: The fists look ok, the daggers look bland but ok. The swords are VERY dull. A couple of the more &quot;business like&quot; (i.e not stat-stick looking) maces seem decent. I guess we shall see.<br />
<br />
One thing i'm dreading is they made the weapons simpler looking to reduce polygon count and help with performance. While i'm not a snob with a nice system wanting the best and screw the guys who will have problems with the glows and moving bits etc nice looking gear DOES matter.<br />
<br />
As far as the shattered/powered weapons goes. There's only a few bits of the expansion that are norse based. If you look at halls of lightening theres a lot of powered electrical bits. The globe in lokens room is a holographic projection. That's NOTHING to do with norse. Ulduar etc is very much strange, powerful titans who seem to use this strange magical power they make by passing a magnet thru a copper coil (electric). The number of powered golems wandering around with lightening/glows etc plainly showing covers that. If you were expecting rusty/old you're going to be disappointed. <br />
<br />
Icecrown will move back towards a more classic gothic fantasy (eg naxx) but cleaner and newer looking. Less skulls, more spikes and wickedly sharp looking &quot;classic&quot; fantasy looking weapons.</div></div><hr />

Meh, most legendary weapons are class bound, not specc bound, if you look at the hunters bow, every specc can use it, all rogues can use the glaives, warriors too (dunno exactly how, but if the warrior is def capped already, they might be able 2 use the glave, but then again, thats how I see it, correct me if i'm wrong)<br />

As for the other comment (cant find it atm), its not like i dont see it as a legendary if its not for my specc, its just, if its a legendary, i'd like 2 see it viable for all speccs of all the classes that are able 2 get the legendary.</div></div><hr />

It's not about skulls on bone-sticks with more skulls on them. It's just that people dont want to see more draenei spaceship-crap lightsaber everything glows like a xmas tree stuff.

Yes, from &quot;outerspace&quot; not from &quot;future&quot;. There's a whole lot of stuff from &quot;outerspace&quot; like the Orcs, back in WC1 the RTS, Orcs are from outerspace, however they do not carry light sabers and plasma-rifles.<br />

As much as I wouldve loved to keep my green swords cause they looked like a pair of rusted spikes with some kinda rope wrapped around them, I still think this style is very fitting and looks really good...Specially the shields and I loved the constellation dagger...

It's not -really- like tbc. Like stated, they have to fit with the theme, this is not the last instance in WOTLK.<br />
But they have to fit the Ulduar theme, like the armor sets. It's like illidan being a boss in ulduar, it doesn't fit at all, they have to make it fit, and imo, those weapons fits very much imo, to me Ulduar looks like it got this whole 'stone theme' thingy going on, and so does the weapons, strong and solid!</div></div><hr />

And then have people like you bitch about weapons not looking &quot;epic&quot; enough. Can't account for taste, what can I say. Some people will love this stuff, some people will hate it, and you can't please all, that is just the way the cookie crumbles.<br />

<br />
Glaives were spec bound. Thunderfury was primarily a tanking weapon. Shaman had to spec to even be able to hold Sulfuras. <br />
<br />
Atiesh is an obvious analog for Val'anyr. It was available for 40 splinters and to four classes - Priest, Warlock, Mage, Druid with four different versions of itself. There was no choice involved - if you were a Priest or a Druid you got a healing staff, end of story.</div></div><hr />

As far as the mace goes. There is only one model for it. And unless shaman are the only ones with a melee version, i'm pretty much convinced it'll have 2, maybe 3 flavors.<br />

<br />
<br />
however, WoW has made a huge leap in terms of class design, especially now with dual specc.<br />
<br />
So it wouldn't be all strange if it had some type of Benediction/Anathema ability; and I'd also love to see real quests involved in the creation of that item, not like &quot;oh, here are your glaives&quot;. I thought that, even tho I never played a priest, hunter, (and they weren't legendary) it was really nice how they introduced those items.<br />
<br />
Regarding the skins of ulduar-loot, I like most of them, and especially that they made them fit into the instance -which was kinda weird back in mc and bwl, where, with some exceptions, loot had nothing to do with the instance itself, stylistically. However, to me most of the swords just look too simplistic, compared to the stuff you get in the recent instances, or BC. But maybe ingame, they look shiney enough...<br />
<br />
edit: what I really like about WoW, but that's maybe just me, is the fact that's it's not just a fantasy game, but that it involves all kinds of genres, just like it also has countless references to pop-culture etc. In a way, it's just a huge puzzle of cross-references in itself, which to me, is really interesting (and funny) to explore. Like LotR takes stuff from the edda, WoW takes stuff from LotR (like nearly all fantasy does tho) and now goes back to the edda with its references (ie. names like Snorri, Jötun, etc, the general nordic style)</div></div><hr />

The 1h maces look like Flintstones baby rattles, the guns look like Super Soakers, and the swords and boards look like Roman knockoffs.<br />
<br />
Instead of a 1h legendary mace, why not have the quest reward be a legendary weapon that can be chosen for one's class/spec (Staff/1h2h sword/1h2h mace/bow/etc.)? Or would designing that take away from all the game-breaking, desperately needed new icon for old talents or seasonal items? Quite being cheap Blizz...and quit giving the design projects to your kids or girlfriends to do for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Consider collecting FORTY ITEMS your real quest&quot;<br />

It would definitely be strange if Blizzard designed 10 different optimized Val'anyrs for four classes rather than just designed 4 one-size-fits-all Val'anyrs for 9 classes.</div></div><hr />

A weapon is going to look a lot more epic if it looks like it'll actually do damage, not cause a big bruise when you hit someone with your big blunt sparkly stick. They look solid alright, like clubs every one of them.</div></div><hr />

swords look so bland and plain that it makes me sigh. Uldar needs more weapon designs like the PVEHorde and PVEAlliance weapons on the front page. Brutal looking weapons that actually make people want to raid for them. <br />
