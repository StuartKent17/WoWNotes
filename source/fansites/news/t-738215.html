<br />
Also, during the fix/upgrade of the site yesterday we introduced a special feature to make the forums more active: your posts are now randomly posted twice when you hit the Submit button! (Translation: Yeah, known bug, will fix today) <br />
<br />
<br />
Hunter - Cataclysm Pet/Stable Interface<br />
The Call Stabled Pet (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/62757/call-stabled-pet/) has been revamped in Cataclysm. <br />
You can now have 5 active pets and 20 inactive pets.<br />
You can swap between your active pets at any time without any cooldown. The only restriction is to be out of combat. <br />
To change your active/inactive pets, you have to visit a Stable Master in the nearest town. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly, the feature is currently heavily bugged on beta realms and you will have to wait the next build to give it a try. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Western Plaguelands in Cataclysm<br />
The Western Plaguelands are now ready for testing on the Beta realm and it's definitely one of the zone that will make rerolling interesting in the expansion. Blizzard changed the zone completely and familiar faces are now in charge of the Alliance and Horde settlements.<br />
<br />

<br />
Scholomance was also changed and you will probably go through it at least once to do all the quests. What? You don't want to do all the prereqs just to get the instance quests? Don't worry, they're all at the entrance of the instance now. The instance itself didn't change too much, monsters are now level 4x. <br />

Yeah, why is he still there? o_o<br />
Seeing as you bring your commanding officer a shard from his phylactery it would appear as if you actually destroy it when you finish the quest so why is he still around?</div></div><hr />

This is how it is now. I've seen pics of RFC where all the quest givers are inside the instance<br />
<br />
Stratholme as well. Although the biggest improvement with Strath is that they've got rid of those piggin gates on the instance portals. Seriously, who thought they were a good idea?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would make sense to have them all in the instance. Leveling rather fast pace now and with the zones running more smoothely it'll only increase the speed in which you go through the old world. Having the fly all around the world to grab all the quests is a pain that used to be something you did passively because you generally had to visit everywhere anyway.<br />
<br />
With the dungeon finder too it'll work well along side quests being inside, just like the dwarf inside Utgarde Pinnacle.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nuronv</div><div class="date">2010-07-16, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new Pet UI looks great, can anyone confirm that pets are still locked to their chosen talent tree/role or can you pick it yourself. It seems a bit odd to me that they want to make the pet damage equal to give you more choice but make it so you can still only use Ferocity ones for PvE</div></div><hr />

<br />
Technically, shouldn't you then put most of this expansion with those raids as well? Some people just aren't happy unless they are complaining about something ...<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm loving the changes to WPL. It looks like it'll be a real treat to go there once Cata comes out and I can start leveling my Worgen and Holy-cow. UI changes are looking real nice too.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samin</div><div class="date">2010-07-16, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for giving us scholomance again blizzard! I'll just put that next to Naxxramus and Onyxia.<br />
And then you put next to it RFC, stockades, dead mines, RFD, gnomeregan, what? &quot;Oh no, the old instances will stay&quot;? Wtf?<br />
<br />
<br />
And everybody knows boub is a dwarf hunter.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">det</div><div class="date">2010-07-16, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for giving us scholomance again blizzard! I'll just put that next to Naxxramus and Onyxia.<br />
<br />
How about you extend that to every single Instance including MC and BWL - because it is just one of the classic dungeons that was there to stay pretty much in the original form for all the people who level up again. Clearly the mobs are lv 41 elite.<br />
<br />
Just like the 3000 quests in Cataclysm are most likely for the majority very similar levelling quests to classic, in the same areas.<br />
<br />
So you may as well be sarcastic about them giving you Azeroth back. It is the same continent basically with quests to level from 1-60. The part that goes from 80-85 is the &quot;new&quot; part, but to save you some breath...apparently SFK and Deadmines get a lv 85 update.<br />
<br />
So there is another chance for &quot;Lazy Blizz&quot; posts.</div></div><hr />

I prefer Animes over every other piece of art: Character Design, Storytelling and the overall-look (even compared to known artists from history).<br />
I think it comes down to everbodies taste here :P<br />

They are giving revision to almost all the leveling dungeons I hear. This is by no means something that will be part of major progression for gear or otherwise. Do you even play WoW anymore? Yet, you feel the need to complain about some so minor that has no effect on you what so ever. I don't know man, you just seem like a hater to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mastery still exists, but it doesn't come up until you have 31 points in your selected tree.<br />
<br />
For example, a arms warrior that is leveling just dinged to the level where he has 31 talent points. When he places that last point he gains the mastery to have a chance to attack twice on one attack. That level is about the level you start getting the mastery stat on your gear as well. I think it's level 78. The other two mastery bonuses have been removed from the game. The third is the only one to stay.</div></div><hr />

Dungeon chains and quest givers outside of dungeons have created a serious conflict with the way people currently level through the RDF. It would be nice if the quests were all at the beginning of the dungeons and not chained.[COLOR=&quot;red&quot;]<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, why is he still there? o_o<br />
Seeing as you bring your commanding officer a shard from his phylactery it would appear as if you actually destroy it when you finish the quest so why is he still around?<br />
<br />
Araj is LEGENDARY. You don't just destroy legendary creatures. I think there is more history and memory surrounding him than any other creature. No creature has ever been nerfed so much. He went from needing a raid of 10+ to being soloed at level 40. Now that is a nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Or it is how it is meant to be in the end and just serves all those lazy players around :o(<br />
<br />
Really has nothing to do with being lazy. Dungeon quests should just exist with in the dungeon. The way the RDF is currently set up there is no point to do half the quests because they have to be picked up and turned in in zones you will never actually go to.<br />
<br />
<br />
masteries are gone for the moment?<br />
they are not implemented in game or just we waiting for more info?<br />
<br />
The change is to the talent calculator not the game itself. Masteries will NOT be going anywhere!<br />
<br />
<br />
yes because no other classes have there own achievement right?<br />
<br />

Druids also get their own class related achievement. So, apparently class related achievements already exist, and I'm not sure why hunters shouldn't get one.</div></div><hr />

I've been playing since launch and the only thing that I lament was removed for simplicity was the pet loyalty system, simply because it was kind of a neat idea in an RP sense. I guess it's the same complaint that blizzard is making the game too casual-friendly. Shouldn't the game be simple and friendly to casual adventuring/dungeon-crawling with the ability for players to choose to make it really hard (or a lot harder at least, depending on your opinion of difficulty)? Seems to me that's what they've done, and even provided appropriate &quot;Heroic&quot; awards for those who are up to the challenge and, more importantly, have the time to devote.<br />

Be less snarky please, they said it wasn't working right yet so I just wanted to make sure... so unless you're actually in the beta and know for sure then I can just discount anything that you say.</div></div><hr />

Blood elf = high elf, Its just a change of name and ideaology. Just as Scourge and Forsaken are both Undead.</div></div><hr />

I could be wrong, but I could have sworn there was a blue post saying they were taking out dungeon keys entirely so they aren't required anymore, except they were leaving in the keyring for regular quests and such.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's pretty much the furthest thing you can get with 'might' as possible. Females can look mighty (and sexy at the same time), but those definitely don't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will Scholo still drop the epics, such as Headmaster's Charge (and the other one, that the apothecary guy dropped, iirc)? I'm curious if they will be removed completely, turned into blues, or simply downgraded to level 4x item stats.</div></div><hr />

If you don't like that style, fine, but some of it really isn't all that bad.<br />
<br />
Also, take notice of where the vast majority of WoW fanart in that style comes from. Nine times out of ten, its artist has an East Asian name. Take a wild guess what currently is the most popular art style is in East Asia? Similar to how western art tends to be gritty, darker, and severely overmasculinated (see Marvel/DC comics for more), East Asian art tends to be more fun, colorful, and cutesy. It's not bad, simply different. If you don't like it, just move on.<br />

I'm personally a little disappointed that questgivers are sitting inside of instances now. Gives players even less of a reason to step further than two feet outside their chosen city.</div></div><hr />

Nice feature for our huntards, it still wont make me want to play mine again though, he can rot at 80 for a while longer.</div></div><hr />

Nobody has any problem with it if they just draw it normally. But instead they have to put 'MIGHT' on it, when very frankly, it is not mighty at all.<br />
<br />
It's like drawing a snake and then adding feet to it, totally unnecessary and untruthful.</div></div><hr />

You're post is like a representation of what it feels like to be a total complete retard. Really how does it feel to be so alone and unable to even understand yourself, let alone the world?<br />
<br />
Must be harsh.</div></div><hr />
