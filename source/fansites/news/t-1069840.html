The information isn't official yet but assuming everything goes as planned, Patch 4.3.2 should be going live this week. This patch is bringing us Cross Realm raids for older content with RealID friends, a few item tweaks and new items, a few new achievements, and a reduced game client install size. It also brought testing of the 64-bit client which didn't appear to have widespread or major bugs, however I'm not really sure if it will be available on the live realms.<br />
<br />
As usual there's a slight chance (1%) that the patch will be postponed if something terrible happens, but as far as I know, we're good to go this week. <br />
<br />
Cross Realm Raids<br />
We previously introduced the ability to form cross-realm parties with Real ID friends (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/190952-new-real-id-party-feature-now-live/), and now with Patch 4.3.2, we're adding the ability for players to use that same functionality to form raids to run older normal or heroic raids, or participate in Battlegrounds!<br />
<br />
This will allow you to join up with your Real ID friends (http://us.battle.net/en/realid/) from other realms and:<br />
<br />
Form a cross-realm raid and use Raid Finder<br />
Jump in to any classic dungeon or raid and be automatically placed in the same instance<br />
Join forces and dominate the Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
<br />
Please note, you will not yet be able to run normal or Heroic Dragon Soul with cross-realm Real ID raids.<br />
<br />
As we look forward to the BattleTag system (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/209494-introducing-battletag/), it’s a very exciting time for World of Warcraft. No matter what realm you and your friends are on you’ll be able to team up and take on group content throughout the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
4.3.2 PTR and New File Optimization Tech<br />
With the 4.3.2 patch we’ll be testing some new file optimization tech. As you may be aware, with previous major expansion patches (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, etc.) we’ve carried out a time-consuming process to reorganize the game files currently installed on your hard drive to integrate all previous patch files, essentially ‘cleaning up’ what’s on your computer and reducing the full installation size. This process used to require an amount of free hard drive space double that of the entire installation size to complete, which is why we’ve reserved them for large expansion-sized patches.<br />
<br />
The new tech we’re testing with the 4.3.2 PTR will process these cleanups with no additional hard drive space required beyond what the patch is adding. Because of that you may see them appear more frequently with patches.<br />
<br />
While the cleanup is occurring you’ll see a specific message on the launcher informing you the process is currently taking place. If you encounter any issues with the new process please be sure to visit our support site at http://www.battle.net/support/<br />

Items<br />
Vial of Shadows (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/77207/vial-of-shadows/) had the proc damage cut in third and proc frequency tripled to reduce burst in PvP.<br />
<br />
Many of the original level 60 ranked PvP gear items have had Replica added to the start of their name, making their name identical to the versions being sold in Area 52, for example the Replica High Warlord's Cleaver (http://db.mmo-champion.com/item/77580/#15050/15148). However, they still retain their higher item level and stats.<br />
<br />
Gurthalak, Voice of the Deeps (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/78487/gurthalak-voice-of-the-deeps/) had its proc time increased to 12 seconds from 10 seconds. This change was made to all three versions of the item.<br />
<br />
The three new items added in Patch 4.3.2 are found on the TCG Loot vendor in Booty Bay. They are part of the Timewalkers: War of the Ancients expansion. (Feldrake (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79771/feldrake/), Eye of the Legion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79744/eye-of-the-legion/), and Demon Hunter's Aspect (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79769/demon-hunters-aspect/))<br />

You have to kill a pack of Eyes of Occu'thar if you want to reach Alizabal, and you said it yourself - people don't go for Occu'thar any more so it makes more sense for trash to be related to Alizabal rather than Occu'thar. The same thing happened with Argaloth's trash when Occu'thar was released.</div></div><hr />

No, it just sounds like their MMO is placed in a &quot;real world&quot; universe. Hence why they need to deal with product placement and licenses for the use of trademarks that do not belong to them.<br />
<br />
PS: Product placement does not mean advertisement, it means that companies pay to have their products and similar used in said TV show/game/whatever. For example if Microsoft pays the producers of Castle for using their Windows Phone 7 in the series, that is product placement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
currently what makes fire ahead is his AoE ability especially on yorsahj, partly on hagara. on single target fights fire mages are already on 3rd, 4th spots according to statistics (median not top parses because not everyone has legendary staff and imba luck with 10 percent more average crit for the encounter than he should have - yes, fire top parses are affected by luck MUCH more than top parses of any other class)<br />
<br />
and with that said - what needs nerf is NOT our single target dmg (by cca 5% - yes, by 5%!) but our AoE ability. what about changing combustion to spread only to X (e.g. 3 like for Living Bomb) targets?<br />
<br />
this nerf will push fire in 25HC and 25normal bracket under arcane mages on single target fights and compared to other classes and specs fire will be on the bottom of the middle of the pack - on single target fights.. <br />
<br />
in 10HC it is difficult to provide fire mage with all buffs therefore many guilds rather use arcane mage already + on spine there is huge need for arcane mage anyway - therefore fire mage with this change will be almost non-viable - being an option only for one or two fights..<br />
<br />
this is very good example of how STUPIDLY blizzard balance classes in WoW: they know fire is ahead, but they have no idea WHERE exactly is fire ahead, where is lacking and where is just fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, model edits are somewhat tough to detect... While blizzard probably doesn't like you screwing with their files at all, I'm pretty sure their chief concern is about model edits that change the client-side size of objects- such as modding the gates in battlegrounds to be smaller so you can edge around them, making mineral nodes larger, and other stuff like that that would give players an unfair advantage.</div></div><hr />

PVP should be treated totally as an insignificant side-game in WoW. It has far too much impact on the main PVE game as it is.<br />
<br />
Rather than crying about imbalance just think how impossible it is to balance all these classes, specs, gear, combos etc and then go play a real PVP game. I actually think &quot;Pet Battles&quot; coming in MoP is one of the most interesting things as it could be developed into a full, balanced PVP aspect of the game. This is what it should be - one class with a mixture of abilities that always fights in the same &quot;gear&quot;, then you have balance.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm...that's very possible. I wasn't considering a 'real world' universe personally since there were mentions of it being steampunk-themed.</div></div><hr />

first of all you are QQing on wrong forum - try official forums instead. and this nerf will happen - that is for sure. and it is also quite sure that it will push great majority of mages back to arcane and it is also quite sure that blizzard did not realize how hard and wrongly targeted this nerf is and how strong the impact will be - for example you can expect many legendaryless mages to be seated because both raiding specs will be subpar :-)<br />
<br />
blizzard's nerfs are usually that stupid - why are some people still surprised by this?</div></div><hr />

Back on topic though, can anyone verify if this means we can queue as raids again for bgs? Because we already could have realid friends in a party to queue, which wouldn't be new. Thanks. :)<br />

<br />
The roaming Eyes of Occu'thar have been replaced by hateful creatures who serve Alizabal.<br />
<br />
What's the point of this? Not like people kill Occu'thar anymore...<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that means the ad's in that you have to kill to get to Alizabal.</div></div><hr />

If it was like on the PTR there are 3 roaming mobs that are mini verisons of her that use the same whirlwind mechanic.</div></div><hr />

Holy Radiance was overpowered with it. Now the question I have is, does 5% do enough to justify a 4p bonus? I know not all 4p bonus' are worth while, but they take one of the better ones and nerf the hell out of it. I feel like it would have been better to just nerf Holy Radiance, so that with the 20% 4p bonus, it is where they want it, would be the better solution. Sure, your forced to use the 4p bonus, but at least then its worth something. I dunno, just seems like a crazy nerf. Maybe just coming up with a new 4p would have been better. I dunno, qq and all that.</div></div><hr />

Umm, what you described IS advertisement. Even if it were a &quot;real world&quot; setting, they could have made-up brand names. If they use existing, real brand names, they are getting payed for it. Why? Because it's advertisement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Does that mean we'll be seeing a lot more people sporting transmog'd 60 PvP gear now?<br />
<br />
I don't think so, but it's not clear. I think this change is applying to the level 60 transmog gear in Area 52 (which currently does not say Replica before its name) for people who had the legacy rank 9+ FOS from the original PVP system. Haven't seen anyone confirming/denying that, and the info in this post (and the previous one) is confusingly worded, because it seems to be saying that the current Area 52 gear says &quot;Replica&quot;, which it doesn't.</div></div><hr />
