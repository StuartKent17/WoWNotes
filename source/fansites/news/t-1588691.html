Beta is about experimenting, things change a lot. You're going to get laughed at for making such a big deal over experiments &quot;just in case&quot; they happen. <br />

No. World of Warcraft has needed an increase in difficulty across the board and giving us a ton of class/skill nerfs is one of the ways to go. Tanks shouldn't be able to stand there and take 10-15 swings from a boss whilst a non-tank gets one-shot, tanks should be able to take 2-3 hits before they're also dead. I genuinely believe we'll see more/better tanks show up again in WoD hopefully due to the increase in difficulty tanking.

Welcome to the gamer part of the internet, it's pretty much 90% whining about anything, even if you like it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vehlin</div><div class="date">2014-09-09, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tanks shouldn't be able to stand there and take 10-15 swings from a boss whilst a non-tank gets one-shot, tanks should be able to take 2-3 hits before they're also dead.

<br />
That's totally at odds with Blizzard's stated objective with regards the healing changes. If Tanks can be 2 shot then healers need to keep them at 100% as much as possible. Blizzard have repeatedly stated that they want players to routinely have much lower health percentages and for healers to not be able to quickly heal them up. You can't have it both ways, either healers go to triage healing (as per Blizzards plan) and tanks can't be globalled or they don't and they can.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying the sky is falling here. If they want to move to a triage system then boss damage needs to be reduced, this would trivialise tanking unless they also reduce tank DR abilities to match. I can get behind this change, my issue is that I don't trust that blizzard will tune all damage throughout the whole game appropriately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tanks have been getting more and more and more powerful throughout the expansions and just like ability pruning it's time to bring them back in line a bit.<br />
I'll main a tank still because I think tanking is fun, not because I can take 50 million more beatings than anyone else. Eternal Flame ticking up to like 200k+ isn't reasonable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leih</div><div class="date">2014-09-09, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yikes. The exaggeration is heavy in these comments.<br />
<br />
Celestalon already posted a very lengthy explanation and warning about the tank changes in advance, and the logic behind it is pretty sound. I know people don't like to be &quot;nerfed&quot; in any way possible, but it's not really a nerf when they are lowering the standard across the board. They're just changing where the baseline is, not nerfing a particular class. Look at the whole picture behind the new healing/tanking changes and not just your own class changes and then shout about the sky falling.<br />
<br />
And for those who think these changes are so huge that they make tanking go from wonderful and fun to &quot;now we just stand there and be meatshields&quot; are you really serious? The changes are no where close to that in severity. One could even make an argument that lowering the duration of your main CD, and upping the recharge time of things like Shield Block slightly increases the skill required to play a tank rather than reduces it, since (to use a prot warrior as an example) it won't be so easy to just sit there and have 100% shield block uptime (without set bonuses) as it is now. Heaven forbid you might actually have to choose when to use your AM abilities rather than just using them as soon as the previous runs out.</div></div><hr />

maybe before you are going suicidal and ranting about this, i suggest you inform yourself a bit more.... celestalon has posted a wall of text about how and why they have to nerf tanks. nothing of these changes here alters your gameplay as it was in wod beta until now. obviously they also adept the boss dmg to these changes. so just stop whining pls and do a little research.<br />
<br />
EDIT: i feel really bad for the devolpers of this game : ( they have to live with so much shit getting thrown at them... GUYS THIS IS BETA. they are testing things, adapting things. sometimes not at once but in a period of a few patches. if you cant live with the fact, that they are changing stuff, just dont look at the patchnotes until wod is released. THEN you can decide whether you like this or not. If you read these patchnotes here and think &quot;oh mai gooood, sey are nerfing my class&quot; then you have clearly no idea how this beta thing works</div></div><hr />

Buffs/Nerfs are good, not bad.<br />

It's even harder to have perspective if you only read patch notes.</div></div><hr />

Seriously pissed off with these tank nerfs. Was worried before, but now we're just going to be things that the boss hits. Just like it was in Cata, which was the worst expansion for tanking. Healers pumping all their now weaker heals into meat shields that have a few very short defensive cooldowns on long CD's and weaker AM and self healing.<br />
<br />
Prime example: Eternal Flame's HoT now heals for 2% of what it does on live.<br />

2 FUCKING PERCENT!<br />

Looks like tanks are going to take a hit in their population this expansion. GG Blizzard, way to go to increase the population of the least played role. Idiots.</div></div><hr />

They are good since the classes affected were so OP that they were unkillable in raids. <br />
<br />
Geez, people stop freaking out. These are tweaks done so that tanks can still, you know, risk dying in a fight. A tank should not be immortal, otherwise it would trivialize all content. Stop expecting everything to be easy-mode handed to you. I support this return to form that we have not seen in a long time. The outright said that when tanks chain pop their CD's in WoD beta right now they cannot be killed. Playing a tank will require skill again, that makes me happy. I've been tanking since Vanilla, and to me this feels more like tBC style tanking: We aren't immortal plate (or fury butt) wearers. We are Meat Shields, and that is how we should be. We should be more like a DPS that is less squishy and does somewhat less DPS (my guess is around 70% of the dps, while being far less squishy. That seems to be exactly what they are aiming for).<br />
<br />
And Eternal Flame is already OP. Seriously, a Prot Pally is usually #1 HEALING on Garry thanks to Vengeance. Not sure if Resolve will effect heals, though.</div></div><hr />

They are unkillable in WoD raids. That's what they were testing and they found that tanks in Beta were unkillable in raid testing.<br />

I do not care if the game becomes easier to balance or whatever, it is just more fun when the tanks have more control, when healers have more control, when range dps has more control (movement), and when melee has the tools they need. The changes I saw was needed was around interrupts and silences, and here they have done well.<br />
<br />
I totally get the game will be reasonably balanced as always, as Blizz is some of the best in the industry at that (they really are.), but not everything about a game's class design is game balance. What I'm saying is that overall, most choices were made on a -game balance- basis rather than class identity, fun or anything else. I could of course be wrong but after providing feedback in testing, and following the actual changes, it's sort of how I've ended up feeling about it.<br />
<br />
Still, I'm excited just for the rest. Everying else about the expansion is just great in my book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT: i feel really bad for the devolpers of this game : ( they have to live with so much shit getting thrown at them... GUYS THIS IS BETA. they are testing things, adapting things. sometimes not at once but in a period of a few patches. if you cant live with the fact, that they are changing stuff, just dont look at the patchnotes until wod is released. THEN you can decide whether you like this or not. If you read these patchnotes here and think &quot;oh mai gooood, sey are nerfing my class&quot; then you have clearly no idea how this beta thing works<br />
<br />
Well I wasn't doing either and I did read his entire thread. I just dislike the fact that they are removing a lot of survivability of tanks. Generally I have basically said all the things you have about it being BETA and things changing. Just everything they have been saying with these Tank changes they seem extremely adamant about.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed being able to be self-reliant on my tank since if I had a bad healer I could still mostly carry a group just with my Tanking abilities, Taking all those abilities and halfing them kind of seems like it will get to the point again that If you have a shit healer you are pretty much doomed to fail since it is hard to carry as a tank which is just an over-glorified meat-shield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because in WoD beta raid testing tanks were UNKILLABLE. This was said over...and over...and over...and even Celestalon did a Wall of Test about it. In 5 mans they were fine, but in a Raid environment in beta, where a tank would be chain casting their CD's in a rotation, the tanks just could not die even if the healers weren't up to par.</div></div><hr />

And Eternal Flame is already OP. Seriously, a Prot Pally is usually #1 HEALING on Garry thanks to Vengeance. Not sure if Resolve will effect heals, though.Well i agree. All of this whining about tanks being neaf badly is stupid. tanks right now are OP. If their damage is 75% and toughness is 500% while we are at 100% at both from an DPS perspective then tanks are 287,5 more powerful overall then DPS's all classes should be at 100 percent. and with tanks being the only ones in raid that can take a couple of hit without popping a Defense Cd without being at the brink of death is ludacris. look at it like this. tank toughness drops, Mob and boss falls to match it and the result is a boost for Dps and Healer survivability which reduces the strain to a tank worrying about damage done to squishies. I welcome the change and I think it will be good in the long run.</div></div><hr />

Soloed a lvl 101 rare in Shatt as blood dk yesterday , I had 630ilvl gear on, been soloing this rare for weeks with little issue, and had a lot tougher time off it after these nerfs, Hunter happened along after Rare spawned and I decided to watch, with his pet on focus I watch as a hunter with less gear then a tank soloed the rare with his pet never dropping below 75% health,WTF , I on the other hand was battered around down to 30% health several times. I can now say with out a doubt I will not be leveling as a tank if these changes go live, also will not be tanking any 5mans. Though I agree that something needed to be done about tanks survivability in Raids, changes of this magnitude where not need in 5mans or leveling, just don't agree that because tanks where to powerful in raids we should nerf them for very aspect of the game. I raid 12hours a week, but play the game about 30 hours a week or more, so now all aspects of my game play are affected because of Raiding ? just doesn't make sense to me, there are many other things that could have be done to fix this RAID issue, that wouldn't have affected the other aspects of the of game so drastically. just my 2 cents on the issue</div></div><hr />

<br />
Celestalon already posted a very lengthy explanation and warning about the tank changes in advance, and the logic behind it is pretty sound. I know people don't like to be &quot;nerfed&quot; in any way possible, but it's not really a nerf when they are lowering the standard across the board. They're just changing where the baseline is, not nerfing a particular class. Look at the whole picture behind the new healing/tanking changes and not just your own class changes and then shout about the sky falling.<br />
<br />
And for those who think these changes are so huge that they make tanking go from wonderful and fun to &quot;now we just stand there and be meatshields&quot; are you really serious? The changes are no where close to that in severity. One could even make an argument that lowering the duration of your main CD, and upping the recharge time of things like Shield Block slightly increases the skill required to play a tank rather than reduces it, since (to use a prot warrior as an example) it won't be so easy to just sit there and have 100% shield block uptime (without set bonuses) as it is now. Heaven forbid you might actually have to choose when to use your AM abilities rather than just using them as soon as the previous runs out.<br />

But I believe it's you who just said a page or two back: &quot;Why such drastic tank nerfs? If those nerfs went live to my monk today I would feel devastated, and immediately stop playing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you're so involved with your class that the nerfs seem &quot;drastic&quot; and you'd be &quot;devastated, and immediately stop playing it&quot; I think it's a tad hypocritical of you to come off so hostile to a poster who lets you know that there is a very comprehensive explanation of the tank nerfs.<br />
<br />
None of us here probably have the time or capacity to keep up with the countless changes in beta, but it only takes a minute every other day or so to quickly scan the topics of blue posts or check MMO headlines to see if there's news about the classes we specifically play.<br />
<br />
Or you can just go on being hostile to folks who point that out, and &quot;immediately stop playing&quot; when the changes come as a shock.</div></div><hr />
