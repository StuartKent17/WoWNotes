However, I'm a little bit upset that even though buying pets/mounts from store is optional, we will never get such mounts or pets with this quality, cuteness and etcetera through in-game source, basically not from the in-game store. Like, do we have a colour changing mount or pet? We don't as far as I know..</div></div><hr />

Perhaps because the quality of the base product is low? Argus is so fucking bugged, I feel in a beta test....just a few examples: &quot;you can`t loot that&quot; &quot;no loot&quot; &quot;evade&quot; &quot;no path available&quot; (for a mob which standing in the front of me..) magically disappearing flowers, chests, nodes as the collection bar going full....WQs magically disappering during the killing the wq target...and so on....</div></div><hr />

If you are killing NPC while WQ is not active in your interface you cant expect to complete WQ. hapend to me in broken shores not on argus. Runing out and in will help)<br />
<br />
Chest despawn is not bug. Chest stays for few secs after someone loot it. Its not bug when you are late.<br />

Never had problem with NPC evading as hunter</div></div><hr />

You are truly retarded, you can see the chest, you can start looting it and it despawns right after looting without the loot, real bug. You can see boss on your minimap marked as WQ and still not get credit for it, happens rarely but it does.</div></div><hr />

This is not the issue with Argus but with the whole WQ system overall. Just logout and it fixes itself. So much to cry about.</div></div><hr />

Like, do we have a colour changing mount or pet? We don't as far as I know..<br />
<br />
Buy a wow token with gold, that is how you get the pet ingame, just like asny other mount/pet for gold off a vendor, this one costs about 100k if you count it that way.</div></div><hr />

I am kinda suprised people complain about &quot;oh store mount&quot; i mean... would they rather have it ingame on a vendor? if people want to buy the pet they can use gold they would buy the pet for, to buy a wow token to buy the pet with.. i mean, having it on the store with the new wow token just means its gold price changes day by dat.</div></div><hr />

Hey look. Someone throwing a tantrum about an optional purchase! :rolleyes:<br />

And if this is a charity pet I will buy it. Always willing to give money towards a good cause.</div></div><hr />

However, I'm a little bit upset that even though buying pets/mounts from store is optional, we will never get such mounts or pets with this quality, cuteness and etcetera through in-game source, basically not from the in-game store. Like, do we have a colour changing mount or pet? We don't as far as I know..<br />
<br />
Subjective opinion.<br />
There are store mounts/pets I like, and some I do not.<br />
Store does not simply equal quality for everyone.<br />
Sure the colour change is I think currently unique to the store, but that alone does not make a pet or mount attractive to me personally.<br />
In fact the last mount (can't recall the name at present) doesn't appeal to me at all in its appearance, colour changing or not.<br />
And that is one of several that don't.</div></div><hr />

The fact that you actually believe the ARC is going to help people with that donated money is even worse. You'd have to be ignorant to help them profit from this disaster by buying this pet despite how cute it is.</div></div><hr />

Do you even feel ashamed? They're donating 100% of the earnings to Red Cross and Disaster Relief. Not 50, not 80, but all of it.<br />
What else they could they do to make you happy, give you 100$ when you buy the pet?</div></div><hr />

You know if you find few posts about some problem 0.001% of player have. it doesnt mean im laying when i say i never have problems like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are killing NPC while WQ is not active in your interface you cant expect to complete WQ. hapend to me in broken shores not on argus. Runing out and in will help)<br />
<br />
Chest despawn is not bug. Chest stays for few secs after someone loot it. Its not bug when you are late.<br />
<br />
Never had problem with NPC evading as hunter<br />
<br />
Jesus..First, I find the post to prove, i have something behind my words..unlike you...Second...Really...If the WQ not active then killing of the target is pointless?<br />
Strange...facepalm and silent cry...I`m talking about they are WQ target but the WQ disappears or not even popping up before/during/after kill...and no genius, not because the wq vanished and over..usually a relog helps...<br />
<br />
Third aham...and those chest surprisingly exactly that time despawns as my opening ends..not before, not after, exactly in that nanosecond 3 times out of 10...and guess what..a few days ago I went for a chest with a druid..he was faster, he looted first, then i did...when we started to move away he whisped to me: &quot;did you loot it?&quot; I said &quot;yes&quot; he replied &quot;weird, it`s disappeared for me&quot;....but it`s not a bug, it`s a feature...<br />
<br />
&quot;Never had problem with NPC evading as hunter&quot; this is can`t be anything just a pure and fat lie...never any mob evaded for you..sounds legit...<br />
<br />
I love the white knights..never any bug, issue happens with them, not even if Blizz itself approve the issue</div></div><hr />

Now whether or not you believe in the Red Cross or not is up to you, as they love a bureaucratic system where little of the funds actually get to the people that need it but hey... it's the thought that counts right?</div></div><hr />

We are talking about Argus. Not about whole WoW since vanilla m8. And how I can prove there is no problem for me when there is not? You think you find a post on the forum where people are talking about things that work? Topic: Argus chests working perfectly - Hello i am here just to say when I looted chest on argus I actually get loot. WoW, blizz great work.<br />
<br />
Problem with WQ not activating is not just argus problem but WQ system problem. Happens on broken isles too.<br />
<br />
I didn't experience some unique bug on argus that wasn't known since the start of Legion.<br />
