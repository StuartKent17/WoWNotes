<br />
Its to test how good you are at the game, you dont generally need a million rewards for that.<br />
<br />
If they did have some rewards, then people wouldnt see how far they could get based on their skills, they'll just try to find the easiest way to cheese the whole thing. &quot;Hey if i stand here, half-glitched in the wall, i avoid all the mechanics&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't really mean its before or after. For example the PVP titles are always before the name of the player, the string is just listed this way here. So there's really no way of knowing til people actually get it. W.e though, not really any differance to me.</div></div><hr />

Proving Yourself: Endless Damage (Wave 30) Successfully complete Wave 30 of the Basic Damage (Endless) trial at the Proving Grounds. 10 points. Title Reward: The Proven Damage Dealer. 10 points.<br />
Proving Yourself: Endless Healer (Wave 30) Successfully complete Wave 30 of the Basic Healer (Endless) trial at the Proving Grounds. 10 points. Title Reward: The Proven Healer. 10 points.<br />
Proving Yourself: Endless Tank (Wave 30) Successfully complete Wave 30 of the Basic Tank (Endless) trial at the Proving Grounds. 10 points. Title Reward: The Proven Tank. 10 points.<br />

This game is all about a carrot on the end of a stick, you don't put in rewards people won't do them. And no I don't consider a lame title to be a reward. If they don't actually add some real rewards this feature will be a flop.</div></div><hr />

Dunno, personally I like the fact I'll be able to literally prove I'm the #1 DD/Healer/Tank in guild. :cool: A Title and ranking system is more than enough. It's more to prove to yourself and friends than a mount or transmog stuff.</div></div><hr />

It cant really flop because its not supposed to be a progression path, and it doesnt requires other people with you. Its to make yourself feel better about yourself.<br />

Maybe I'm reading that wrong but how is that a nerf?<br />
<br />
Down to 3 Chi from 4 so you acquire it faster...<br />
Use Tigereye Brew to consume the charges, granting you 6% increased damage and healing for 15 sec. which is up from 5%...<br />
You can only consume up to 15 stacks at a time for 90% increased damage up from 75%...<br />
<br />
Seems like they buffed it a little bit. Granted the whole spec and class needs much more than that but I don't see how it's a nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bronze mode - Average to Above average players will find this challenging but not impossible. Passing through Bronze mode will give you the stamp of approval for normal mode raiding guilds<br />
<br />
Silver mode - Almost impossible to complete without playing your class perfectly. Average players will hit a brick wall here and above average players will really struggle here. Still not impossible but requires perfect play. PvP heroes and casual 5 man heroic players will not succeed until they get better at the game. Even the most hardcore of players will need a good few hours of wiping before finishing. Wiping here is nothing to be embarrassed about<br />
<br />
Gold - Impossible. No one will succeed here for a few weeks. Requires insane play that only the best are capable of. Takes days of wiping to even pass the first wave. Once you know the encounter inside out and have a solid strategy down can you start to progress through the waves of mobs. Will include a metric shit ton of one shot mechanics. If you stand in the wrong place at any time during this encounter you will be killed instantly. Getting Gold is an impressive achievement and will earn you celebrity status on your realm.<br />
<br />
Endless mode - Endless mode is insanely difficult. Only the best of the best of the best can do well here. Where getting Gold mode shows that you are one of the best, Endless mode shows you ARE the best. Each time you enter, the encounter changes randomly so you can't learn a strategy and get some addon that tells you what to do. This relies on pure instinct and draws upon your full experience as a WoW player. One wrong move and your dead. Even the most advanced players in WoW will fail here as they are used to watching a boss mod timer to know when to do stuff. For this you not only need to play your class like a God you also need lightning fast reactions to adjust to the ever changing encounter.</div></div><hr />

I for one hope that Proving Grounds is difficult.<br />
<br />
Bronze mode - Average to Above average players will find this challenging but not impossible. Passing through Bronze mode will give you the stamp of approval for normal mode raiding guilds<br />
<br />
Silver mode - Almost impossible to complete without playing your class perfectly. Average players will hit a brick wall here and above average players will really struggle here. Still not impossible but requires perfect play. PvP heroes and casual 5 man heroic players will not succeed until they get better at the game. Even the most hardcore of players will need a good few hours of wiping before finishing. Wiping here is nothing to be embarrassed about<br />
<br />
Gold - Impossible. No one will succeed here for a few weeks. Requires insane play that only the best are capable of. Takes days of wiping to even pass the first wave. Once you know the encounter inside out and have a solid strategy down can you start to progress through the waves of mobs. Will include a metric shit ton of one shot mechanics. If you stand in the wrong place at any time during this encounter you will be killed instantly. Getting Gold is an impressive achievement and will earn you celebrity status on your realm.<br />
<br />
Endless mode - Endless mode is insanely difficult. Only the best of the best of the best can do well here. Where getting Gold mode shows that you are one of the best, Endless mode shows you ARE the best. Each time you enter, the encounter changes randomly so you can't learn a strategy and get some addon that tells you what to do. This relies on pure instinct and draws upon your full experience as a WoW player. One wrong move and your dead. Even the most advanced players in WoW will fail here as they are used to watching a boss mod timer to know when to do stuff. For this you not only need to play your class like a God you also need lightning fast reactions to adjust to the ever changing encounter.<br />

That kind of misses the point of their purpose. They're supposed to teach, not be murderous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Down to 3 Chi from 4 so you acquire it faster...<br />
Use Tigereye Brew to consume the charges, granting you 6% increased damage and healing for 15 sec. which is up from 5%...<br />
You can only consume up to 15 stacks at a time for 90% increased damage up from 75%...<br />
<br />
Seems like they buffed it a little bit. Granted the whole spec and class needs much more than that but I don't see how it's a nerf.<br />
<br />
Some people have no clue how to read patch notes or tell what is a Nerf or not. Half the timee they see red there is nerfs.</div></div><hr />

Nope, sorry. <br />
<br />
The intended tuning is supposed to be: <br />
<br />
Bronze is more or less equivalent to on par for 5man heroics, Silver for normal raiding, Gold as ready for heroic raiding. Endless should be significantly challenging, though.</div></div><hr />

While I want it to be hard, I don't want it to be eye bleeding difficult like doing Heroic Lei Shen with 490 gear which is kind of what your asking for.<br />

I hope 30 waves of endless is close to R10 brawlers guild in ~510 ish gear.<br />

I don't even know how to reply to this, as I'm sure you won't understand reasoning. What good is something like this if even second prize would be impossible to get? Endless mode is where you prove yourself, bronze-gold are where you learn. Your idea ranks very high on the 'most stupid idea about WoW ever' list (removing or changing LFR tops it though).</div></div><hr />

TL;DR: <br />
&quot;I am an under the average bad player who spends his/her life on this game. Something challenging gets to be released that will actually show how bad I am is to be released. So instead of being marked as the bad player I am, no one above the average play-level should be locked out of 75% of the content thus cloaking my inferiority in this game I was my life with, yet too ego-maniacal to accept and get support for my condition&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry if that was tough but this is the kind of random gibberish the players of this type spew when a new content that has proper learning-curve balanced with proper difficulty gets introduced.<br />
<br />
I am really looking forward to these proving grounds as both me and various groups I have entered dungeon with have tired of me or someone else trying out their new spec for the first time, regrettably making the rest suffer (granted it is generally a healer or tank position in question).<br />
<br />
Guess this is one of those big features the patch will introduce :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on the wording of the preview the healing aspect might not be a big issue as you are given a healer. The description for tanking was quite empty though compared to the DPS roll. I hope there are situations where the tank also has to interrupt and pop cooldowns.<br />
<br />
I am a little worried about warlocks and needing heals due to life tap. It would force certain talent choices.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are pretty easy right now, i did the healer one as a resto druid. Got into endless in less than 30 minutes after the second DC i decided to give up.<br />
They also dont seem that consistent meaning some early rounds are harder then late rounds and round 10 /10 gold will destroy you but 9/10 is a pushover. They need balancing for sure. Overall i liked the idea, i still think its a great feature but there so easy right now all they teach is mana management not really what spells are good at certain times and even thats a bit of a stretch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Already beat gold dps with my DK. Took a few tries and respeccing from unholy to frost but its doable. Definitely will be difficult for many players. Just have to not miss an interrupt on the healers and not get stunned in the amber while immediately taking down the shrieking lady when she is up and avoiding the banana peels. Wave 8-10 on gold dps is a burst dps race.<br />
<br />
On healing, i am on gold on my mistweaver monk and got up to wave 9/10 but ran out of mana due to spirit being scaled down.<br />
<br />
On tanking, I am on gold too got up to wave 9/10. <br />
<br />
Quick Note for testers: Make sure you do Xuen's initial quest &quot;A Celestial Experience&quot; and &quot;A Witness to History&quot; to access the proving grounds.</div></div><hr />

You get a Wolf with horns stuck on it for defeating Hellscream. And for the SoO meta you get a red primal-drake with horns stuck on it. WOO! Cheers Bliz. The fact Bliz is clearly still hiding the Heroic drop is making me hope it might be something good at least.<br />

The Fey Dragon and the Storm crow WILL both be store mounts. (with a possibility one could be an annual pass reward instead).<br />

I'm not just trying to be negative or anything. The &quot;This mount changes depending on your Riding skill and location&quot; part is used on all Store mounts and has been the damning proof to tell if mounts will be store bought in the past, mainly because it opens up their use for low level players and people in battlegrounds.

The Fey Dragon and the Storm crow WILL both be store mounts. (with a possibility one could be an annual pass reward instead).<br />
<br />
I'm not just trying to be negative or anything. The &quot;This mount changes depending on your Riding skill and location&quot; part is used on all Store mounts and has been the damning proof to tell if mounts will be store bought in the past, mainly because it opens up their use for low level players and people in battlegrounds. Sorry.<br />
<br />
Your trying to be negative.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xyrax</div><div class="date">2013-07-16, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what is the goal of the proving grounds? To give players something else to do at 90? Or is it to tempt people into starting alts in the different roles? A sort of &quot;I want to try tanking but I don't want to start an alt just to see if I like it&quot; thing?<br />
<br />
It lets people new to a role/class/max level go somewhere to train in their role instead of using YOUR instance run as a classroom and introduction to healing/tanking/DPS.<br />
<br />
This is obviously a good thing, and everyone should be okay with it. People are extremely critical of bad tanks dps and heals in instances, LFR, and raids in general. Now those people actually have some place they can go to learn at their own pace.<br />
<br />
A target dummy may be pretty nice for a dps to learn their rotation, but it doesn't help a tank learn when to properly use what cooldown, juggle interrupts and watch the field for stray aggro headed for his healer etc. This is desperately needed to improve the overall play of the games playerbase. I would go as far as to say every MMO from this point onward should have a similar feature.</div></div><hr />

Want to find me another example? That one's fundamentally a horse at least.<br />
Honestly, I was saying the same arguments that you were before the Bat was announced to be a store mount. I couldn't believe that Blizz would put a mount with so much lore around it and so much historic demand as a cash mount and I ignored the evidence, stuck my head in the sand.. then it was announced as a store mount, just as Everyone said it would be. The Crow doesn't even have ground mount animations, and the Fey dragon is going to look stupidly huge running round in battlegrounds. Like phoenixes and all the other drakes, they would just have the ground mount disabled, to stop them going being used in BGs etc, but if it's in the Blizz store its ok that people are running round the floor in BGs on a hovering gigantic banana dragon.</div></div><hr />

So that skill is a bigger factor then gear? Maybe some HC players wont be as leet as they think they are. (Note: majority of the higher ranked players would no doubt be HC raiders, just don't be too surprised to see a &quot;lfr-hero&quot; or two to rank up there)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If players jumped into the game at level 90 I could perhaps understand this but I thought the whole point of starting a character was you start at level 1 and you learn the class as you progress up the levels. For example I had never healed before I started a healer.. I jumped into an instance as soon as I could and I learnt to heal on the job. And personally I think it's the best way of learning, knowing that if you fail, people die. You learn to think quickly and pick priorities in your heals. You get thrown curve balls. I loved it. Will a single player experience offer that? I'm not so sure. Healing a bot is great and all but do they screw up like real players and stand in fire etc? Or pull two groups instead of one? Oh and I didn't let anyone die until BC dungeons.. so learning with real people in instances doesn't always equal tears.<br />
<br />
Also with tanking.. great, you learn about threat or whatever. But will it teach you how to pull packs of mobs? Or not to pull until your healer is ready and has enough mana?<br />
<br />
Maybe this is for the people boosted to level 80 or 85 or whatever is it now. Maybe i'm being too critical. I'm sure it's a nice feature. It just feels weird to me.</div></div><hr />

Clarification from a blue:<br />
<br />
For clarity:<br />
<br />
Retribution and Protection-specced Paladins will continue to generate one charge of Holy Power when casting Judgement, regardless of talent choice. Selfless Healer does not alter that.<br />
<br />
Holy-specced Paladins who spec into Selfless Healer will now generate one charge of Holy Power from Judgement. It will not generate that charge if they choose a different talent.<br />
<br />
Hope that clears things up. As per usual, anything on the PTR is subject to change.<br />

I'm just wondering how this is going to work. It's great that you have something to practice on solo now but Blizzard has added a lot of tools in the past but it doesn't really look like people are using them a lot. (The average player doesn't feel the need/want to get better at their role, I think...)<br />
<br />

I was hoping the the Proving Grounds were going to be more complex, perhaps a pseuo dungeon crawl with trash 'packs' and 'bosses' rather than a static room -but perhaps that will come later, I hope so! Would love to see some complex mechanics, surviving by the skin of your teeth... I'm thinking the difficulty of solo'ing Cho'gall in Bastion of Twilight as DK.<br />
<br />
As a tank I found it very intimidating to start tanking in 5 mans, even though I knew my class inside and out and had outgeared what I was queuing for. The Proving Grounds, as I see them, aren't necessarily for 'learn to tank'/dps/heal, but a mechanism for you to get over the psychological barrier that many face. A confidence booster if you will.<br />
<br />
I know some have/will dismiss (sic) what I've said, and will suggest that they themselves 'jumped straight in' to healing/tanking instances, but I for one -and now I know many more on my friends list -felt or still feel that tanking (which is essentially a leader role in PUGs) is daunting. So yeah I bet many people will love Proving Grounds, even though in its current iteration it isn't a Tanking God factory it will still go some small way to making encouraging more players to Tank (Heal or DPS) -and that can only be a good thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is why the WoW community is deemed a foul one nowadays.<br />
<br />
People play the game for fun and having have to read walls of texts which you had to dug up for proper/gear/spec/keybinds is a big dent on the experience of the casual player. Why?<br />
<br />
Due to how game works right now questing is only really viable when you are a dps. Hence, a class with other specs than dps may end-up in level-cap with only limited knowledge of his/her class outside the spec they played with all along.<br />
<br />
However, suppose you are a Priest who wants to try out the healing aspect of his/her class, your first time doing in a dungeon leads into the following: <br />
a) Gets you kicked out of the instance as well as being insulted<br />
b) Making a group of tolerant people miserable<br />
c) Ending up with a poor soul who is kind enough to switch to healing so that (s)he do your role instead while you dps as you used to.<br />
<br />
In all three cases you end-up with an undesirable gaming model due to at least a single player experiencing bitterness instead of having fun.<br />
<br />
For this reason proving grounds is essential to gameplay as well as being a viable pre-condition to using &quot;Looking-for&quot; tools to enchance the overall player experience.<br />
<br />
To elaborate more on this point: <br />
The completion of proving grounds' can be made into the pre-condition for using LFBG/LFD/LFR, to queue for Flex raiding and HC Scenarios. <br />
In turn to make them appealing at the same time, the initial completion of these scenarios can reward half of the equivalent currency for the most expensive main-armor piece.<br />
<br />
The examples are as follows:<br />
A priest dings level cap and is required to complete the bronze-level of DPS-proving grounds to queue as dps in LFD and bronze-level of Healer-proving grounds to queue as a healer in LFD. LFD, LFBG and maybe the Scenarios would require the completion of Bronze-level.<br />
Upon completing the bronze for a spec the first time, the player would be prompted to claim their reward of 1.1k JP or 1.1k HP (Granted a chest-piece costs 2.2k JP or HP for PvE or PvP respectively). <br />
For pure dps classes or those that has less than 3 specs, this could be balanced so that entry into dungeons with different specs for the first would grant them 1.1k JP or 1.1k HP. <br />
Druids could get some exclusivity on this or the earning of these rewards would be limited to a maximum of three times.<br />
<br />
Same would be repeated for Silver-level which would be the requirement for queuing for LFR/Flex/HC Scenarios.<br />
<br />
If you complete Gold or hold a rank in the Endless trial you'd be recognized for someone being capable of normal raids or heroic raids respectively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly I wish it was just a single hallway with maybe 10-20 packs of trash, progressively harder, and bosses after every 5 packs. With an endless hallway available as the challenge after Gold.<br />
<br />
Tanking:<br />
<br />
You get a single healer in your group who just puts a constant HoT with perfect 100% uptime on all members of the party, and it heals for let's say 10k/sec.<br />
<br />
It's up to you to pull as fast as possible without taking on too many mobs that their DPS outpaces the HoT on you...and it's up to you to control the damage coming from the mobs so that they aren't dealing more damage to your party members than the HoT can top off. Ie: You need to be interrupting spells targeting your party, stopping AoE abilities being cast like Bladestorm, etc., and also trying to deal as much damage as you can while also managing your own defensive cooldowns. Your party's DPS is tuned so that you still add a very decent chunk of the total damage, and can't ignore your own output.<br />
<br />
Gold, Silver, and Bronze are all based on how quickly you made it through the hallway. Endless mode is scored on how many packs you're able to clear through, and how fast you're able to do it.<br />
<br />
DPS:<br />

Similar to the Tanking challenge, you get a healer in your group with a constant HoT on everyone. Your party's DPS is tuned so that you're a far bigger portion of it than they are, probably something like an 4:1 ratio to make sure it's more a test of your skill and output, but still gives incentive to keep party members alive via interrupts and stuns on mobs. You need to kill groups as quickly as possible, while also shutting down abilities, and also managing the damage you receive as well so that it isn't killing you faster than the HoT is healing you.<br />
<br />
The faster you get down the hall, the better you do. Endless mode scored same as the tanking challenge, and factoring speed as well...that way people aren't just sitting there spamming interrupts, fears, and stuns in order to make each pack last as long as possible while waiting on DPS cooldowns to pop back up.<br />
<br />
You're allowed to pull additional packs any time you please, which will help your speed and improve your score...just make sure not to pull too many and let the tank or yourself die.<br />
<br />
Healing:<br />
<br />
Much like the current healing challenge, you get 3 DPS and a Tank in your group. You heal them as they clear through the dungeon. Any time a party member dies, they are resurrected @ 50% HP after 15 seconds. Healing them is the goal, but remember that often times, preventing damage is much better than healing it...so using your interrupts and CCs would be heavily encouraged, and so would aiding in DPS on some mobs which need to be burned down (ie: Lay Waste skeletons from Valithria Dreamwalker).<br />
<br />
After every boss, you get a mana sphere restoring 200K mana. This simulates a quick drink after bosses. It also allows for things to get more hairy and interesting since you don't need to balance around only natural mana regen (around 100K/min in ilvl 463) which doesn't really allow for a test with much very heavy healing.<br />
<br />
You're allowed to pull additional packs any time you please, same as the DPS test. It's scored similarly to the DPS test as well.<br />
<br />
To me, those would be the most ideal scenarios to put into Proving Grounds.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard loves putting in content nowadays that takes them 2 seconds to make, but you have to spend 1,000 hours grinding to get all the achieves and the best times.<br />
<br />
Also...I got beef with the floor texture. Is anyone else tired of wildly oversized textures? It's just lazy! Was the room designed by giants? the inlay/scrollwork/whatever you want to call it should be much smaller and more intricate if it was designed by a normal-sized pandaren.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need to be a druid, I am going to prove I am the best healer-tank-dps in my guild....<br />

So what is the goal of the proving grounds? To give players something else to do at 90? Or is it to tempt people into starting alts in the different roles? A sort of &quot;I want to try tanking but I don't want to start an alt just to see if I like it&quot; thing?<br />
<br />
I think there are two goals. First, it will be a hell of a lot of fun for guild bragging rights, and also just for anyone who likes an increasingly challenging feature.<br />
<br />
But probably another purpose is to get dps warriors, pallies and dks to try tanking in a stress free environment, especially ones not in big guilds. If you got to lvl 90 as a fury warrior, some people would not like to jump into heroic dungeons and get screamed at... especially at the end of an expansion where heroics are just go go go.<br />

Based on the wording of the preview the healing aspect might not be a big issue as you are given a healer. The description for tanking was quite empty though compared to the DPS roll. I hope there are situations where the tank also has to interrupt and pop cooldowns.<br />
<br />
I am a little worried about warlocks and needing heals due to life tap. It would force certain talent choices.<br />
<br />
The tanking one should include many tasks, but one of those tasks needs to be surviving a healer silence, or like 10 seconds of increase damage. To teach you either to blow your survival cds or have your self-heals ready. But probably most of it would involve picking up adds and interrupts and hopefully positioning. Props if they require a LOS pull.</div></div><hr />
