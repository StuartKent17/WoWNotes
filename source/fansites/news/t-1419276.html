Patch 5.4.2 - Raid Browser<br />
Just a quick update to yesterday's post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3623-Raid-Browser-LFRAdvanced-Addon-Dampening-Dismiss-Pet-Blue-Posts-50-Off-Sale) about the Raid Browser. It seems like it isn't completely cross-realm, but instead cross realm for each datacenter (in the US), with the Phoenix and Los Angeles datacenters being combined. You can see which of the three groups you are in on this WoWPedia page (http://wowpedia.org/US_realm_list_by_datacenter).<br />
<br />
People also appear to be having trouble finding the Raid Browser. There are four ways to find it, one is the &quot;Other Raids&quot; button on the Raid panel, you can also type &quot;/rb&quot;, you can also assign a key bind in the key bind settings, or you can use the button on the PvE finder frame that is added by the LFRAdvanced addon (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/lfradvanced).<br />

<br />
Raid Browser - Warlords of Draenor<br />
The new Group Finder tool in WoD (6.0) will completely replace the Raid Browser, and you will also be able to find it in a much more noticeable location. <br />
<br />
We’re focusing our efforts in polishing the Group Finder in order to make it as good as it can be, maximizing its potential from the very start. <br />
This is something we’ve learnt from the past, if the tool isn’t good enough from the very start or it’s not very accessible, it might lose its momentum, and once that happens it’s very hard to “jumpstart” it again. <br />
<br />
It’s a tool that depends on player numbers for its own success, we want you to see other players using it every time you go there, and the risk is if you don’t, you might never go there again, and eventually that behaviour tends to spread out.<br />
<br />
We also don’t have any plans to change the current Raid Browser until it gets replaced by the new tool.<br />
<br />
The Group Finder will be a big improvement both in terms of functionality and visibility; we definitely want players to know where to find the tool in very intuitive manner, and hopefully trade chat spam will become a thing of the past. (at least in it comes to forming groups…)<br />
<br />
<br />
Heroic Dungeon Difficulty in Warlords of Draenor<br />
You can take part in some ongoing discussion on our forums in this thread (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1414985-Warlords-of-Draenor-5-man-Mythic-dungeons-Are-you-for-or-against-it).<br />
I’d like to start out by saying that we’re completely aware of the demand from the community for dungeons at a very high difficulty level.<br />
<br />
As you know, WoD will (re)introduce the normal and heroic difficulties for 5man's at max level, which is already a very nice change in my opinion. <br />
<br />
There are players who have been playing WoW for a very long time, they’re extremely skilled and will only be satisfied with the highest level of difficulty that we throw at them, that’s “perfect entertainment” for this type of players.<br />
<br />
We also know that not everyone can raid in very high difficulty environments due to its big time commitment. Sometimes life changes, and suddenly instead of 3-4 hours every 2 days, some of these players will only have 1 or 2 hours, and that makes shorter/smaller instances with the same difficulty level as “mythic” an extremely appealing concept.<br />
<br />
Challenge modes will probably be interesting for some of these players, but we also know that when people talk about TBC heroic 5man difficulty levels, they’re not talking about mindless zerg/rush timed runs. They’re talking about planning, strategy, CC, improvisation, randomness and sheer insane mobs/bosses power, but the “timed” part is still an important concept in game design to keep everyone on their toes. <br />
<br />
We know all that, and we’re doing our very best to provide the most diverse content we can for the next expansion. <br />
<br />
Your feedback can change a lot of things, just keep providing it and we’ll be sure to recognize your needs, devs are very interested in high quality feedback, and it can go a long way in changing some priorities during the development of WoD.<br />
<br />
Having said that, the current planned difficulty scheme for 5mans at max level is Normal, Heroic and Challenge mode. Right off the bat, we can clearly say that WoD heroics will be much harder than MoP heroics.<br />
<br />
Now, we’re not actually planning in making them as hard as the hardest heroics of all time, like the hardest from TBC, or GB and Stonecore from Cata, but nothing is set in stone yet, we’re still thinking about what will be the right difficulty level for anything WoD, and your continued feedback will definitely help us find that elusive sweet spot for a perfect tiered difficulty system.<br />
<br />
We also think that we can rework a little bit the whole concept of challenge modes, right now people tend to think about them as purely timed runs, but they can be so much more than that.<br />
<br />
I mean, the “timed part” doesn’t necessarily have to imply disregard for control and strategy; hopefully, we’ll be able to make challenge modes much more compelling to the highest skilled players out there, especially those that can’t raid but want to experience equivalent difficulty content to mythic raids in a 5man environment. <br />
<br />
If you have any particular views on the subject, I’d love to hear what would be the “perfect challenge mode” for you, specifically in regards to reward structure and gameplay philosophy concepts.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but Cata heroics weren't really hard for organized groups.<br />
You’re right, they weren't as hard as let's say, Shattered Halls HC. Our current goal is to make WoD heroics similar to the difficulty level you had in Vortex Pinnacle heroic for example.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I loved Stonecore, it was fun trying to make a clean run where no one would do any mistakes, it wasn’t super hard, but I’d say most bosses had very unforgiving mechanics. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing of course, but bosses like Ozruk for example, need to have better visual cues when they have one-shot mechanics. <br />
<br />
Good design needs to be more intuitive, it’s not really that fun to read through the full dungeon journal and memorize everything before fighting any boss, it’s much cooler when something is so well implemented that even if it’s completely unexpected you can still try to “guess” what it does and adapt, react to it on-the-spot, just like you would do with anything unexpected that happens in real life.<br />

Dismiss Pet Changes<br />
As a followup: we've got a hotfix in the works to lower Revive Pet's casting time to 2 seconds. Our goal was to remove the awkward gameplay of dismissing/swapping pets to bypass cooldowns and debuffs, not to make it harder for Hunters to have a pet active. With Revive at 2 seconds, you should have a much easier time getting your pet back on its feet.<br />
<br />
We're also investigating the reports of Revive Pet being interruptible through Deterrence.<br />

Hearthstone had their first patch in some time this week, with some nice changes, like being able to abandon a daily quest, the new ranking system, and some amusing new cards (http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/716-rogues-do-it).<br />

There are so many channels of more difficult content. However it barely affects me, since I will run them with my guildies for a week and then never look at them again once we start raiding. So my opinion may be a bit unnecessary. lol</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarien</div><div class="date">2013-12-12, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd actually love a return of challenging Heroics. Nothing is more satisfactory than knowing you're in a hostile environment that will brutally punish your mistakes but handling things without a hitch, or when shit hits the fan but you react and manage to get to grips with the situation before you wipe, that's when you know that you're good, when you know your team is good. It's like heroic raids but on a smaller scale.<br />
<br />
I would say provide plenty of dungeons, say ten, and have the first on par with MoP Heroics and scale them up so that the last few are Grim Batol/Stonecore... Maybe even Shattered Halls or Shadow Labrynth. Honestly GB wasn't hard even in PuGs, as a DK tank at the time I'd just mark what needed to be CCd, deathgrip the first target to die, silence the casters to bring them closer, and burn everything down. <br />
<br />
We need challenging heroics to teach people the basics, take a run through any LFR or RBG and watch people completely fail to appreciate crowd control, movement, positioning, cooldown useage or even their basic abilities.</div></div><hr />

I personally loved Heroic Dungeons in TBC mostly because I didn't raid often and the challenge was fun, although often frustrating when pugging. I knew a lot of people who hated them though. <br />
<br />
Wotlk introduced the easy mode heroics and a lot loved it, but some complained they were too easy and loot fests. Blizz tried to listen to the people who wanted more of a challenge and Cata heroics went back (kind of) to the TBC model and the majority cried it was too hard. So they nerf them, later MoP comes out and people complain about how easy they are again and people complain its too easy once again. <br />
<br />
So here we are, people claiming they want hard heroics, and if Blizz listens, again, we will have to deal with people yet again crying about how hard it is until it gets nerfed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's pretty much &quot;all&quot; you had to do in TBC heroics to make them not-hard. Well, sans deathgrip as it didn't exist then. From my experience the Cata heroics, pre nerf at least, were as hard as / harder than the majority of TBC heroics. Only Shattered Halls really stood out as being hard, but if you CC what needed to be CCed it wasn't that taxing.<br />
<br />
The difficulty needs to be tuned right though. MoP and Wrath heroics were too easy, Cata heroics were too hard for pugs.<br />
<br />
<br />
and have the first on par with MoP Heroics and scale them up so that the last few are Grim Batol/Stonecore... Maybe even Shattered Halls or Shadow Labrynth.<br />
<br />
The problem with that is some dungeons would be hugely unpopular once the grind sets in. You'd have players leaving as soon as they appear in one of the &quot;harder&quot; instances. <br />

<br />
It's not that weird. The playerbase is so large in WoW (even after sub losses) that frankly whatever Blizz do it will upset a fair number of players. And truthfully, there isn't a right or wrong answer, only opinions. It's why Blizzard can't listen to every piece of &quot;advice&quot; given by every noob / leet.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xanwryn</div><div class="date">2013-12-12, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard Heroics wouldn't be an issue if they remember to ease people into them. Cataclysm Heroic weren't hard for anyone who was still aware of TBC Heroics or for anyone who looks up fights and strategies (or can adapt quickly) beforehand. However, despite the fact these dunngeons weren't as hard as TBC's they were still much more difficulty than WotLK's and Blizzard did not prepare anyone for the transition from easy to challenging.<br />
<br />
Whether you think the Heroics are hard or not isn't the problem here. A lot of people did and were vocal about their opinions, and Blizzard should have allowed these people to adapt gradually, rather than hit a wall they weren't expecting. This was the same problem that the Inferno difficulty hard in Diablo 3. It wasn't that it was hard, it was that it was much harder than previous content and the difficulty simply wasn't expected.<br />
<br />
Aside from this, I don't care either way. One thing I've learned to understand and adapt to is the idea that MMO's become much easier as time goes on, not the other way around. World of Warcraft has been a yardstick for MMO's since it's popularity increased over 5 years ago, and because of this many MMO's start &quot;hard&quot; and are simply made easier as time goes on. I've yet to see or play an online game that has gotten harder over time rather than being nerfed and made more &quot;accessible&quot; or easier.</div></div><hr />

I stopped playing the game in Cataclysm because I couldn't gear for raiding because all random heroics consisted of people wiping on the first boss and leaving. I was not getting anywhere gear-wise and it was frustrating and exhausting and just not fun.<br />
<br />
Now with things like Timeless Isle, players are able to sidestep the 5-man content to a greater extent and get gear that at least gives them a baseline capability for raids. If they keep that in there then I don't mind challenging non-raid content.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nobleshield</div><div class="date">2013-12-12, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vortex Pinnacle was one of the easier Cata Heroics, so I'm cool with that. Nothing really required CC other than the last 2-3 packs at the end (the ones with the 2x healers) and what made that annoying was the grounding field since they were immune to CC while in it. That would be a fine difficulty for heroic dungeons; we don't need super hard heroics because they're going to go from running to gear up to running for easy JP/VP within a month or two, and by then nobody is going to care about them being hard or challenging, just something to get done with so they can start on something else.<br />
<br />
I really do hope that they remove the time from CMs or make it so the timer for Gold is more forgiving. The biggest issue I and many others have with CMs right now is that it forces you to cheese it and sneak past as much as possible, which isn't very challenging at all. That sort of stuff should be needed if you are trying to get it done as fast as possible for the leaderboards, but not for a typical &quot;I want Gold&quot; run.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ogemaniac</div><div class="date">2013-12-12, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my solution<br />
<br />
1: Have three dungeon difficulty tiers instead of two, adding Mythic. Yes, it would be as hard as it sounds, and reward appropriately.<br />
<br />
2: Scale the difficulty of the Heroic and Mythic dungeons when new raids were released, so that they would remain challenging throughout the expansion<br />
<br />
3: Scale up many old content dungeons to cover a gamut of difficulties between and including the regular dungeon difficulty and the current Heroic tier.<br />
<br />
Essentially, regular dungeons would be a normal part of progression for new level 100 characters. Heroic dungeons would be where current-tier normal (current flex) and LFR raiders, as well as casuals, picked up some extra gear. Mythic dungeons would offer gear useful for Heroic and even Mythic raiders.<br />
<br />
Frankly, something similar to #3 should be done with raids as well. With the new scaling tech, there is no reason that many old raids couldn't be reborn as content to play in that was somewhere between fresh level 100 difficulty and LFR difficulty.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llerrok</div><div class="date">2013-12-12, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd actually love a return of challenging Heroics. Nothing is more satisfactory than knowing you're in a hostile environment that will brutally punish your mistakes but handling things without a hitch, or when shit hits the fan but you react and manage to get to grips with the situation before you wipe, that's when you know that you're good, when you know your team is good. It's like heroic raids but on a smaller scale.<br />
<br />
I would say provide plenty of dungeons, say ten, and have the first on par with MoP Heroics and scale them up so that the last few are Grim Batol/Stonecore... Maybe even Shattered Halls or Shadow Labrynth. Honestly GB wasn't hard even in PuGs, as a DK tank at the time I'd just mark what needed to be CCd, deathgrip the first target to die, silence the casters to bring them closer, and burn everything down. <br />
<br />
We need challenging heroics to teach people the basics, take a run through any LFR or RBG and watch people completely fail to appreciate crowd control, movement, positioning, cooldown useage or even their basic abilities.<br />
<br />
You're absolutely right, I wholeheartedly agree.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">papajohn4</div><div class="date">2013-12-12, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's pretty much &quot;all&quot; you had to do in TBC heroics to make them not-hard. Well, sans deathgrip as it didn't exist then. From my experience the Cata heroics, pre nerf at least, were as hard as / harder than the majority of TBC heroics. Only Shattered Halls really stood out as being hard, but if you CC what needed to be CCed it wasn't that taxing.<br />
<br />
Not the same thing...you could not cc before pull(without aggro) and classes had much less tools for cc/interrupts. As a Warrior I did not had the range silence and the only viable cc was mage sheep in most situations. In cata if you used cc the tank almost did not take any damage and if you did not use cc the tank could still survive with a decent gear and a good healer. In TBC, if you did not cc you were dead. Also aggro was not trivial as it was in cata. DPS and Healers should always watch their aggro and tank had to actually be very good to build good aggro. And if a DPS or healer got aggro they were dead the very next moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
As long as there are alternative venues for gearing yourself up for raiding then I don't mind challenging 5-man content. I stopped playing the game in Cataclysm because I couldn't gear for raiding because all random heroics consisted of people wiping on the first boss and leaving. I was not getting anywhere gear-wise and it was frustrating and exhausting and just not fun.<br />
<br />
Now with things like Timeless Isle, players are able to sidestep the 5-man content to a greater extent and get gear that at least gives them a baseline capability for raids. If they keep that in there then I don't mind challenging non-raid content.<br />
<br />
Why you didn't run them with the people you were supposed to raid with once you get that gear? Or the plan was to also raid with randoms? As far as I know LFR was first made much later in cata...<br />
<br />
Anyway, content shouldn't designed for random anonymous un-enchanted/ungemmed afkers(no talking for you here, but for the general random wow player). Especially the content with the prefix &quot;heroic&quot;</div></div><hr />

Ye harder hc than TBC and Cata at launch way to go, and again I will spend with some random grp 3 hr for clear fk dungeon,maybe is good for ppl who are in guilds and have friends in game but not for me I dont have time for raiding when takes 3-5 hr what abot to clear just one dungeon,they suppose do some kind on switch for hc like quick mode and mythic mode or whatever but for same rewards,is up to you if choose mythic mode over easy mode.I prefer quick mode than wipping over and over.<br />
<br />
i understand why u dont see it as a good thing but it is ! it is a brilliant thing and this alone will keep me subbed for sure - when dungeons will be an actual really important part of char progress and a part of guild progress too . when u will prefer to actually run it with capable guildies in guild group rather then with npc unnown randoms ) - now onlything which is left to hope for is that lfr will be gated behind a really full hc dungeon gear requirement (maybe -1,-2) itlv and then it and flex (new normal) will be much better experience for everybody. this is what we missed most this expansion.will the gearing up in those take most players (non raiders) few weeks yes cause why not - lfr will be gated anyway so no need to hurry through it to later whine that they only run same lfr/flex week after week and have nothing to do exept for it. its a good thing and very good thing for game. <br />
<br />
also capping jp/vp ? wont be a problem at all since there will be separate lockout for normal/hc/mythic so if anyone raids and really need it - he will be capped from raiding alone.</div></div><hr />

If you want them to be semi-endgame content for casual, more or less solo players who pug, then they need to be like MoP or Wotlk heroics.<br />
<br />
When you are with a group of friends, or a guild, there is much more communication.. that is a small issue.. but the bigger issue there is much more forgiveness for learning and wipes. Guilds wipe 20 times on a boss... but if you put the same 25 people in LFR with their guildmates, but don´t let them know who they are,they will ragequit after 2 wipes and call their guildmates baddies.</div></div><hr />

It is a good point. BC was difficult, WotLK was faceroll, Cata pre-nerf was difficult, MoP was faceroll, <br />

<br />
Would you be happy if the Heroic 5man quality gear that dropped was on-par with say the first tier of the new xpak's LFR?<br />
<br />
That way people doing raids could also run those to fill out pieces or at least feel another option was available...<br />
<br />
However, I don't know if I want them to increase the difficulty and gear quality every major patch in those afterwards. There's a lot about vanilla and BC I miss, but having to do all the old content and then do all the older tier raids, just to gear up enough to join your mates in current tier was rather annoying. The part I hated the most about it was if you lost 1-2 key people, you had to put progression on hold (if you couldn't recruit someone of that gear quality) and gear up some alts or new people that was undergeared.<br />
<br />
I like that people can quickly catch up. I was asked to start tanking on an alt DK that I literally only decided to finish leveling to 90 a few weeks ago. I did the Timeless Isle stuff for a day, had enough gear to start queuing up for LFRs and then guild ran through a TOT Heroic with me tanking in the 496's and I did fine, and got a bunch of 535 gear. I'm now doing SOO LFR and Flex perfectly fine and my DK alt has been 90 for less than 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />

1.TBC : hard heroics . &quot;We want them to be a challenge&quot;<br />
2.WOTLK : easy heroics. &quot;We thought the heroics were too long , too harsh , too much crowd control. Let's make them easy&quot;.<br />
3.Cataclism : The heroics were too easy . Let's make them again hard , let's bring back the crowd control,let's make them longer.<br />
4.Mists : We actually think the heroics were hard , and this time we will make them easy , shorter . And without cc required .<br />
5.WoD : Well, let's make them hard again !!<br />

<br />
To be honest , this roller-coaster game design just show their incompetence . And keep losing them money. This hard-easy-hard-easy-hard-easy-hard just piss of everyone , the hardcore and the casual crowd.<br />

If I would have been their boss I would have asked them to chose a game direction , no matter what , and fkin stick to it . Right now is just a mess. <br />
<br />
And if they will manage , in their &quot;infinitely wisdom&quot; to make some heroics like those in Cataclysm , then WoD indeed will be a Time Travel Expansion.<br />
They will return at the moment when they lost 2 milions players because of the hard heroics. And will live again that moment .</div></div><hr />

Thats why MMO Champion has to post how to find it on their front page? Please the majority of players do not know where it is and blizzard is so full of shit its not even funny.<br />
<br />
'We dont want to make the same mistakes as the past.' Will you look at that we are literally talking out our asses... That is quite the feat! Blizzard seems to be quite good, epic at doing this.<br />
<br />
Another thing, this idea that heroic dungeons need to become impossible again, is game throttling at its best. No one asks to make heroics more difficult in the beginning they ask to keep them challenging as our Ilvls go up so that we do not outgear the content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Solution: As the game progresses, increase the heroic dungeon difficulty with a patch, add more and better gear to be won. Add a mythic lvl in the middle of the expansion.(People with a brain)<br />
<br />
Another thing, kalgon or w/e the fuck it calls himself... It sounds like that dude fucks the game royally all the time and has his appointed lead dev take the damage... seems to be the case with GC maybe even Tigole from before but thats my take on the tweets I have been reading.</div></div><hr />

It's like heroic raids but on a smaller scale.<br />
<br />
I would say provide plenty of dungeons, say ten, and have the first on par with MoP Heroics and scale them up so that the last few are Grim Batol/Stonecore... Maybe even Shattered Halls or Shadow Labrynth. Honestly GB wasn't hard even in PuGs, as a DK tank at the time I'd just mark what needed to be CCd, deathgrip the first target to die, silence the casters to bring them closer, and burn everything down. <br />
<br />
We need challenging heroics to teach people the basics, take a run through any LFR or RBG and watch people completely fail to appreciate crowd control, movement, positioning, cooldown useage or even their basic abilities.<br />
<br />
It's called challenge modes. Enjoy.<br />

Yeah that's what I was thinking. They just released a broken half assed feature that they even say right off the bat they'll be REMOVING and giving us something else built from scratch. So people see this thing, that was there before btw and was a joke. And think wow, this thing is slightly better but still a joke, I'll pass. Then when wod comes out people will say oh they're messing around with that raid browser thing? Pass.<br />
<br />
Should have just left it alone and left us with openraid/oqueue and unveil the thing in wod. It also won't help that the feature will be buried among all the other stuff going on with a new expansion. Also most will probably forget about it since they can't use it right away, they'll be leveling.</div></div><hr />

It was a far cry from my first heroics as a tank with sub 20k health compared to 40k health and the backing of 3k dps by the end.<br />
<br />
Heroic dungeons don't need to be mindlessly difficult, what needs to be reigned in is gear. Besides if you want a real challenge I think that should be the domain of raiding. 5 mans, normal and heroic, should be kept full accessible to all players with heroic requiring some better coordination. If some players want challenges then go to challenge modes or high end raiding. The simple fact is, most of those boasting on these sites about wanting really difficult content are nothing more than water cooler hard cores. I never seem to be able to link them/their characters to any guilds pushing the envelope!</div></div><hr />

I used it for 4 of my toons so far and spent literally a minute in it each time to down celestials. It works...if you don't like it then don't use it. Can you imagine if half these crybabies played any other mmo without the gazillion features Blizzard has implemented? Their veins would be bursting out of their skin. Spoiled brat syndrome. <br />
<br />
And about heroics...it's about time they put them back into the game. If they are too hard for you, then get better....I mean afterall isn't that half the fun in playing this game? Going up against hard shit and figuring out what needs to be done to overcome it? I understand everyone wants to be able to farm the shit out of content, but why does it have to be all content? If you aren't willing to overcome difficulty in a video game then you are doing everyone else a disservice. There's no thrill in content so easy that you don't even have to know anything about it.</div></div><hr />

It's been a few months and still my server isn't on it... =(<br />

Feels like the roll out is slow as heck, you figure by now it'd be fairly easy to just start pairing shit up and start doing it.</div></div><hr />

They even said they lost A LOT of casual players because of how difficult the heroics were and HAD to nerf them. Now they are making them hard again, I find this hilarious. I'll be waiting to see how many more people they lose at the start of WoD, I'm almost betting the amount that return won't be enough to cover for the amount lost from that. Either way won't effect me because I rarely run dungeons, after I'm max level.</div></div><hr />

As am I with my old RP server which consistently rates as LOW population at all times I see it. Stormwind had similar issues as to what you give on your PvP server. Even the coalesced realm leaves Goldshire empty whereas on my current PvE server Goldshire is so heavily populated that you nearly line up for some quests to get them done. That and all the duels going on makes for a very alive feeling game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you even read correctly before commenting? Unless I suddenly am blind, they are NOT opening FCM from dead sides, they're opening them from alive sides, as in, horde people from draenor or ally people from silvermoon -&gt; transfer to those other realms. Doubt this will work cause those servers are still ghost towns compared to draenor for horde and silvermoon for ally, but the point was correcting you, this is not the dead side they're offering migrations to, it's the dominant side.</div></div><hr />

I don't see a point in this, one has 300 population, the other has 100. So, now it's a 400 population realm? What am I missing? They need to connect 15 of these together to make it a live realm.</div></div><hr />

Actually, its worse, they are opening FCM from Draenor EU ALLIANCE to Magtheridon EU as well which is a joke since the Alliance on Draenor EU is already so low pop.<br />
This does not make any sense to me.</div></div><hr />
