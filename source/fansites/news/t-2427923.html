You have to pull like the whole damn instance... my group has cleared 7s on time but we couldn't make a MOTHERLODE 4 on time WITH NO DEATHS because we had to kill so much.<br />
<br />
Actually motherload is easy to cheese.<br />
<br />
1)group a warlock<br />
2)kill a lot of trash before first boss, you should be at 60-70%<br />
2)Kill the rest of the % after before 2nd boss<br />
3)put rez stone on your healer after 2nd boss and rush to the 3rd. Die, rez group<br />
3)repeat when 3rd boss is dead to 4th boss<br />
<br />
Can certainly find a clear route guide on youtube/twitch/wathever, I was teached by a MM+ fanatic friend.<br />
<br />
Did a 6 +2 with 5 minutes margin really easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Priest is so broken, that hotfixing them will not do anything to them. Priest needs a major overhaul, not hotfixes.<br />
<br />
The same reason is true for shaman. #smallindiecompany</div></div><hr />

Disc survivability is mediocre compared to druids and paladins and it's never even been the area of contention the damage output has been, and smite is getting a huge nerf. Get good.<br />
<br />
Holy shit your delusional, badly geared disc priest being unkillable in Bg healing and damaging for more then any other healers in the BG<br />
<br />
BG after BG<br />
<br />
youre not playing live obviously or not pvping at all, were talking about pvp</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rogues are squishiest melee class that is designed to be a glass canon now get's to just be glass. Rogue's are a class designed to kill fast before you can hit us.<br />
<br />
Rogues have strong defense for 5 seconds every 2 minutes and outside of that we are a free kill if we break stealth and don't have high damage.<br />
<br />
If you survive the Rogue's opening Stuns / Burst what do they always do? Vanish, if they have it off cooldown, or Blind you and run away. They do that because they are free kill if they don't. Stuns and Burst is all a Rogue has for PvP. I guess we may still be viable in 5's when they are done nerfing Rogue PvP to lock down a healer but that's it.<br />
<br />
If burst PvP isn't allowed in WoW then Rogue's aren't allowed to PvP in WoW. I guess I need to level my Priest for PvP disc healing.</div></div><hr />

Rogues squishy? Rogues glass canon without high damage? *laughs in death knight*<br />
<br />
Rogues have always been at the top of the ladder and considering how ridiculously easy you guys have it in world pvp. I hope they take your daggers and give you chopsticks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Must be, cause after the nerfs the only hunters I see in top are Survival, perhaps we are talking different content here? I'm talking normal raiding + and Mythic 5+</div></div><hr />

I would say that BM is doing just fine. You also have to take into account that BM requires much less effort compared to other specs. The reward:effort ratio with BM is huge.</div></div><hr />
