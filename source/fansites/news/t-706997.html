The X-53 will be replacing the current Zhevra mount reward, which is retiring from the Recruit-A-Friend business after a good run. If you've already claimed a Zhevra (or claim one prior to the change), you’ll be able to hang on to it, of course. We’ll have more details on the new Recruit-A-Friend mount once it becomes available.<br />

<br />
But 310% seems to much. 310% seemed, till now, to be a reward for some kind of dedication : Raid meta achievement, World events (its easy, but you need to stay around). Now, with 15$ you can get a 310% mount. Basically, it's what most people have been whining about, its just disguised.<br />

what i mean is that it takes like 2 weeks (or more?) before i can acquire the mount but would signing me up now make me get the zebra or will it get automatically changed to a rocket during the RAF? since by the time my RAF would be done it sounds like the rocket should be out.<br />

it sounds like (at least to me) that you only get a zebra if you already acquired it or acquire it before the change, but if your not done with your raf before the change you get the flying mount?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is only 310% if you ALREADY OWN a 310% mount. which is very good news for us that do.<br />
<br />
TBH i think once you own a 310% mount all of your flying mounts should be 310% otherwise there is no need to use them.<br />

<br />
its 310 if you already have 310. So you don't get a base 310 mount for RAF, it just adjusts if you have one.<br />
Also why is it fail if many ride it? It's a two passenger flying mount. That is in no way fail except you're one of those kids who think they have to be &quot;special&quot; by having rare things only.</div></div><hr />

That's what I was just thinking as well. Sure it does look cool and is a two seater. But I would not want to create a RAF account just to learn that none other than characters of the RAF account can hop onto the rocket.<br />
Anyone with an US account can post this question in the thread of Bashiok?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also he just clarified the issue regarding current zhevra mounts and pending ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you've claimed your Recruit-A-Friend gift and received the Zhevra you'll need to refer a new friend (thus gaining a new reward to redeem and claim after this change) to also obtain the X-53 Touring Rocket. <br />
<br />
If you have a reward waiting around you have not claimed it can be used to claim a Zhevra now, or you can wait and claim an X-53 after the change.</div></div><hr />

But 310% seems to much. 310% seemed, till now, to be a reward for some kind of dedication : Raid meta achievement, World events (its easy, but you need to stay around). Now, with 15$ you can get a 310% mount. Basically, it's what most people have been whining about, its just disguised.<br />

If you've claimed your Recruit-A-Friend gift and received the Zhevra you'll need to refer a new friend (thus gaining a new reward to redeem and claim after this change) to also obtain the X-53 Touring Rocket. <br />
<br />
If you have a reward waiting around you have not claimed it can be used to claim a Zhevra now, or you can wait and claim an X-53 after the change.</div></div><hr />

If you all ready have Zhevra will you need to recruit a new friend, but if you have un-claimed Zhevra waiting can you chose to wait til X-53 replace Zhevra and when press Claim will you recive the X-53 insted</div></div><hr />

Misunderstood. There is a blue post about that (boub please link it in the OP).<br />
If you have claimed a mount, you can't get it. If you don't have claimed a mount yet but eligible to claim one now you can get the rocket later if you don't claim the zhevra now.<br />

You can't trade the zhevra for the rocket!</div></div><hr />

If you've already claimed a Zhevra (or claim one prior to the change), you’ll be able to hang on to it, of course. We’ll have more details on the new Recruit-A-Friend mount once it becomes available.&quot;<br />
<br />
You'll be able to keep it, lol, like anyone wants to.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mount collectors will want it, also people who can know that (just like the Amani War Bear) 1+ years after the mount is discontinued people will be whispering you while you ride the Zhevra mount saying &quot;cool mount, were did you get it.&quot; That is assuming this game is still around in a few years.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope they'll introduce another 2-seat flying mounts in Cataclysm. Having something like that be exclusive to RAF is kind of lame. Oh well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am very confident that there will be other cooler 2+ person flying mounts in Cataclysm. To be honest this gray 2 person rocket doesn't look all that great. The only thing that makes it cool is that it is the first 2 person flying mount. If it was a 1 person flying mount, I wouldn't think twice about it. I think they are making it &quot;worn out&quot; looking, is because it is designed to get a lot of use from levels 20-85 most likely. Then when you raid or whatever you can get a more colorful looking 2 person flying mount then.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets see 15 dollars +60 dollars<br />
another 15 dollars +60 dollars<br />
<br />
gives me:<br />
Zherva (before it goes away)<br />
2-person flying mount I would hardly use a second seat of<br />
2X30 days of game time free<br />
2 game accounts I'll never use.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is what I am trying to decide on. I am a casual mount collector, but if I am going to be paying $150 to get both of these mounts (and because they are not BOA mounts, I am only getting them on one toon) I can no longer call myself a casual. <br />
<br />
Please excuse me while I sit in the corner and rock back and forth muttering &quot;It is just a bunch of pixels, it is just a bunch of pixels, it is not worth 24 hours of my life.&quot;</div></div><hr />

You will not get your reward till the second month is paid. I.E you will have to pay for a two months game card and get the reward immedatly, or 2 months subscribtion, and wait for the second month to be billed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilesy</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Summary:<br />
<br />
Question: If I already have a Zhevra, can I get this mount?<br />
Answer: No. You keep the Zhevra, you do not get the rocket as well. If you want the rocket, you need to do RAF again.<br />
<br />
Question: Will this mount have 310% speed for me?<br />
Answer: It will only be a 310% flying mount if you already possess a 310% flying mount.<br />
<br />
Question: I have a mount to redeem in my account from RAF but haven't yet, will I get the rocket?<br />
Answer: Yes. Wait until the rocket is officially active ingame then redeem your mount, it will be the rocket.<br />
<br />
Question: How long will the mount stay in my RAF account management? Do I need to redeem it NOW?<br />
Answer: No. It stays for ages. I have had a Zhevra mount in my RAF since September '09 and it's still there and able to be claimed. Just wait for the rocket release.<br />
<br />
Question: Does this mean I can't use it because my country is rubbish and it's banned?<br />
Answer: As far as I know, no. A lot of people are saying you can go into your account management, temporarily change your address, sign up for RAF and change it back.<br />
<br />
Question: Will I lose my Zhevra?<br />
Answer: No, you'll keep it. Sorry.<br />
<br />
Question: How do I get this rocket then?<br />
Answer: You use the Recruit-A-Friend system to recruit a friend. This friend must: 1. Buy the World of Warcraft game, and then 2. Buy 2 months of gametime. Once your friend has been duped into doing so, if you check your account management page and then hit 'Recruit-A-Friend' on the right hand side, you will be able to claim two prizes: A Zhevra mount and 1 month of gametime. You can claim both. Leave the Zhevra til the rocket comes out. Enjoy your 1 month of gametime.<br />
<br />
Question: Can I recruit myself, and essentially purchase the mount?<br />
Answer: Yes. It'll cost 1 copy of WoW and 2 months gametime and is perfectly fine to do.<br />
<br />
Question: TROLOLOLOLOLOLLLOLOLOLLOL<br />
Answer: OLOLLOLL</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last I checked, the Zhevra does not automatically get mailed to you. You go to your account management to have a selected character pick it up, and it's only 1 mount per RAF (not Bind to Account).<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, I think I'll just recruit myself tomorrow. I want a Zhevra, dammit.</div></div><hr />

Also, I for the titans sake hope you can still trade in your zhevra back to get this. I mean, an ugly land mount vs. a 2 seated flying goddamn rocket!<br />
Nvm you cant.</div></div><hr />

Originally 4 accounts got played (one for my gf, one for my brother, one for my brother's gf and one for me. the other 3 were added to raf mounts to my gf, my brother and me (my brother's gf never wanted one, hes not mount obsessed). Now my brother and his gf stopped playing. My gf and me still do, all accounts are now linked to the same Battle.net account, resulting in 7 accounts in my dropdown box on login of which 5 are &quot;dead&quot; accounts. Now they want me to add another 2 dead accounts (resulting) to 9 while I already threw them money for the Zhevra ?<br />
<br />
I can understand they change the mounts but anyone with the Zhevra should get this automatically, we already did what's needed to obtain it, they just want us to do it double....</div></div><hr />

Sure, I can get RAF. My FOURTH bloody RAF incoming. I already have the Zhevra, I recruited a 3rd account for more alts then a friend told me he wanted more alts so I recruited him too.<br />
<br />
Joy, now I have to do it again just to get a rocket mount. Edit, I didn't read the requirements, it's the same.<br />
<br />
Someone kill me please.<br />
<br />
<br />
It'll be RAF 4 &amp; 5 for my husband and I...We did RAF when it first came out (dual-boxing) to get one of each class to 60 and then up to 80...All but 2 have hit 80 so far (been screwing around with misc. alts and other stuff).<br />
<br />
3rd RAF was when we wanted to play with a friend, so we created an account for my husband (I wanted another Zhevra) and did the RAF thing on another realm...<br />
<br />
As soon as the news was announced we were talking and said &quot;Guess it's time to start moving characters to other accounts so we can create more....&quot;<br />

In order to connect the account's there should be a new account so u need to buy at least the game and a game card for the other guy...so technicly with 40 euros u can have the rocket mount</div></div><hr />

But 310% seems to much. 310% seemed, till now, to be a reward for some kind of dedication : Raid meta achievement, World events (its easy, but you need to stay around). Now, with 15$ you can get a 310% mount. Basically, it's what most people have been whining about, its just disguised.<br />
<br />

you only get 310% if you already have a 310% mount</div></div><hr />

From what I remember, and I could be wrong, to get the mount via RaF your bud had to sign up for 2 months. So on top of the $20 for another copy of WoW, that's $30 in subscription fees as well. Though it's a really cool mount, I don't think it's worth $50 to hook yourself up with one. I'm sure once Cataclysm is released they'll be another passenger flying mount available in-game. Besides the &quot;hip&quot; factor of having one, I don't see it really serving a purpose until the expansion anyways. =]</div></div><hr />

You can move abroad, all of a sudden. Blizzard won't check. Just have a legal adress, in the right country and you are off.

They really need to do that, I didn't spend all that time gaining Skyguard and Netherwing rep, Argent tokens, and running Oculus to simply throw away those mounts for a magenta proto drake. I think all the flying mounts should scale to your fastest level of flight speed. All ground mounts should scale to fastest ground speed. I like variety, and it doesn't make sense for developers to spend time creating mounts that are disposable.<br />

One of my exes did this with one of his friends and he actually had to ticket a GM to get his mount because of a bug or something. The good news is you can get a copy of vanilla for around $10 (or less) when it goes on sell, then you just have to buy the two months.<br />
<br />
Too bad they're retiring the Zebricorn. I really wanted it, but always had too many bills to justify a second WoW account. It turns out eating is marginally more important to me than riding around on a Zebricorn.<br />
<br />
Grats to everyone with the Zhevra while it lasted. I guess I'll have to get the rocket at some point.</div></div><hr />

But 310% seems to much. 310% seemed, till now, to be a reward for some kind of dedication : Raid meta achievement, World events (its easy, but you need to stay around). Now, with 15$ you can get a 310% mount. Basically, it's what most people have been whining about, its just disguised.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
You have to already have a 310% mount before this rocket will go 310%. Which means if I get this mount it will not go to 310%, but if someone as clearly skilled at this game as you are who already has a 310% mount, the mount will go 310%.</div></div><hr />

None of my friends play wow unfortunately, just me, so was wondering if it's possible to just buy a 60-day game card and create a new account on my existing computer (I only have one) with my existing copy of wow-wotlk? or do I need a second computer and buy a vanilla copy of wow + 60-day game card? <br />
<br />
<br />
What's known:<br />
<br />
1.) Help! I cannot use the RAF feature! Blizzard hates me! :'( *sob*<br />
<br />
Blizzard cannot be blamed that you cannot use this feature. This is simply due to the fact that some countries have laws that prohibit the use of gambling, promos etc. The RAF seems to fall into that category.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are all players eligible to &quot;Recruit-A-Friend&quot;? <br />
Players with a World of Warcraft account from the following countries are able to &quot;Recruit-A-Friend&quot;: Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Holland, UK, Norway, Sweden, Greece, Ireland and Spain. Players from outside of these countries; players with trial accounts, or with full accounts with five referrals from the &quot;Recruit-A-Friend&quot; currently pending, are ineligible.<br />
<br />
Blizzard Poster Aeus has already made a statement regarding the country issue 2 years ago:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I can sincerely tell you, from an insider's point of view, that we try extremely hard to include as many countries as possible. When our hand is forced, this is generally due to legal restrictions in certain countries. <br />
Forgive me, if I don't know them by heart for each different country, but this is what it will most always boil down to. <br />
If that sounds harsh, please forgive me; I don't like it any more than you do.&quot;<br />

<br />
There is a way to circumvent this, but I may not be held responsible for any actions you do to your account!!!<br />
You should ponder over this thought very carefully, as changing your country might lock your account and trying to convince the billing team that you are from Denmark, whereas your account says United Kingdom, might get you some headache.<br />
The option is to change your address to any of the countries that are eligible for the RAF program.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.) Wooohooo, I am from country XY, where I can use the RAF!! But....what do I have to do now?<br />
Log into your Battle.Net account. Choose your WoW account and in case you have multiple WoW accounts tied to the Battle.net account choose the one, where you want the mount sent to.<br />
On the right side you will see the &quot;Recruit a friend&quot; option, click it and follow the steps to send an invitation. Send it to yourself. If you have troubles sending it to the same email address you use for your main account use a free email service like hotmail etc.<br />
<br />
Sign up for a trial account via the link you have sent to yourself - THIS IS MANDATORY in order for your main account to receive the mount. You then can also check the status of the RAF account via your main account.<br />
Take the trial key provided in the email address and add it to your Battle.Net account. A new WoW copy will show up with the remaining days of the trial. If you want to check, your main account will now have a link to a &quot;friend&quot; who activated the 10-days trial (Status is yellow).<br />
<br />
Go to the newly created Trial account. There you will be presented with the option to upgrade online, either by entering a fresh unused key of Vanilla WoW you got from a CD or by purchasing one directly online in the Blizzard shop.<br />
When you have finished you will then have converted the trial account to a paid account.<br />
This account is now of the same type as your main account.<br />
<br />
Now the only thing you still have to do is to add 60 days of game time to this account. Note that in order to get the mount as soon as possible it might be better to use the game card option. Reason for this is when you use the credit card option that Blizzard will not charge it until the free 30 days, which are given to each new paid WoW account, are used up and even after that they will only charge one month (if you would choose the monthly subsciption), which means a 3 months wait time until you receive the mount.<br />
<br />
This makes your main account eligible to receive the RAF mount. <br />
<br />
Money breakdown in &#8364;<br />
<br />
New WoW account - 14,99&#8364; (Blizzard Online Shop)<br />
30 Days Gamecard - 12,99&#8364; (Blizzard Online Shop)<br />
30 Days Gamecard - 12,99&#8364; (Blizzard Online Shop)<br />
<br />
Several retailers sell Gamecards with 60 days which is about 27&#8364; in my region. That's the option I will pursue personally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not sure if this has been answered yet or not, but they said that hey were planning on making all epic flying speed mounts 310% pseed - IF - you already had at least 1 x 310% mount<br />
<br />
so in other words you can still have the benefits of a raid / pvp special mount but using the skin you like the most<br />
<br />
thatts what the description says on this one too, - 310% if you already have one 310%<br />
<br />
if you however only own 280 then this will remain at 280%</div></div><hr />

i didnt read carefully enough, but yeah your right. i think i wont get this mount afterall, any 310% mount you already have it probably better than this rocket.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uh, it's the first multi passenger flying mount in the game. Currently would best mount in the game.</div></div><hr />

Why the fck it is only obtainable by RAF!!! What about counties that cant use this option!!! I wouldn't care if its only Zebra mount ( whatever the name is ) but giving ppl who can get it this much advantage is stupid!!! Yeah advantage, 30% more XPm and now 2 ppl flying mount is way 2 much!!! Make game equal to all players!!!! If i pay to play same amount of $ or € as other players i would like to be able to use everything they can!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
IDK d00d... how come Invincible's Reins is only available to people who dedicate half their week to raiding? I'll never have time for that. Its so not fair i should just get handed one when i log in!!<br />
Not. I seriously think they did this because the zebra was hardly worth it to recruit people so they changed it up a little bit. Can't blame them for that. Besides, though its been said, It aint blizzard who prevents those countries from RAF, its said countries laws. And if its unfair, sry blizz aint about to change their game plan just cuz a few countries gay little policy</div></div><hr />

The mount is not 310% unless you have a 310% already. People who dont will ride at normal speed.<br />

Yes but then you can have billing problems, and your account frozen like someone said earlier in this thread.<br />
And aswell as if I'm gonna buy something from blizzard, and my adress doesn't match, then that's also a trouble.<br />
It's not like I suddenly move to England for 3 days and then back to Iceland, and even if so, it wouldn't make sense to change the adress, since that's more of a vacation rather than moving places.<br />
