Blizzcon Day 2 - Raids &amp; Dungeons Panels<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
The concept of Ulduar teleports will be back in future instances including Icecrown Citadel. Developers do not want you to have to run for hours just to get back to a boss after a wipe.<br />
<br />
Cross Server LFG<br />
This will let you PUG 5-man instances and search for groups through multiple servers. <br />
It will come with its own reward systems. If you're the leader of a PUG and complete the dungeon succesfully you will be rewarded.<br />
It should be out for patch 3.3.0.<br />
<br />
Icecrown Citadel<br />
Icecrown Citadel will have 4 floors. <br />
It will be a 10 and 25 players raid with 12 bosses<br />
Waypoints / Teleporters are being reused here because the instance is really big.<br />
You will fight Sindragosa, the ultimate Frost Wyrm. You will also fight Arthas.<br />
The instance is built around the spire where the Ice Throne sits.<br />
At the 2nd floor, you will have to board an airship with your faction leader and race against the other faction to reach the 3rd floor. You will eventually board their ship with rocket packs and catapults to fight them.<br />
The 3rd floor seems to be the biggest one and will feature 3 wings<br />
The 4th floor is where you will fight Arthas<br />
<br />
Icecrown Citadel - Dungeons<br />
The Icecrown Citadel will also feature a 5-man dungeon.<br />
It has 3 different wings and feature 8 bosses in total. You will have to unlock the 2nd and 3rd wings through an epic questline. <br />
You will fight alongside Horde and Alliance heroes.<br />
<br />

Abyssal Maw is one of the two 5-player dungeons located in the Sunken City of Vashjir. It will be non-linear.<br />
It's a giant vortex in the center of the zone, getting near the vortex will pull you down to the elemental plane of water.<br />
The dungeon will be on the ocean's floor. You will be able to see the ocean through windows in the dungeon and will make an extensive use of the new water effects in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />

<br />
Lost City of Tol'vir<br />
Exterior 5-man dungeon<br />
<br />
Blackrock Caverns<br />
Blackrock Caverns is an entirely new instance located inside Blackrock Mountains. It was a good occasion to reinvent a fan favorite.<br />
It is now an off-site base for Deathwing and it's now occupied by the Twilight's Hammer. You will find out why the Twilight's Hammer is here and what they want here. <br />
It will feature new art, loot, and creatures. The Beast still lurks ...<br />
<br />
Blackwing Descent (Raid)<br />
Nefarian will return in this instance. This is an entirely new raid inspired by the original Blackwing lair with new loot, new art, new creatures.<br />
<br />

The Firelands is the Elemental Plane of fire. You will fight Ragnaros again here and you will finally fight him at his full strength.<br />
<br />

There is a new LFG system called &quot;Cross Server LFG&quot;<br />
1:42<br />
You can search across your battlegroup for a 5 player instance group. <br />
<br />
1:43PM There will be a reward system for it. If you're the leader of a PUG and you complete the dungeon successfully, you will be rewarded. Tentative release is 3.3.0, definitely before Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

From what they said, they intend to add new things to her arsenal... I also thought it was gonna release anytime now, and I must say I'm very happy with the way she is on the PTR right now. It feels almost like the vanilla version.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm curious about the new LFG system. How will that affect &quot;Additional instances cannot be launched&quot;?<br />

Actually, as you know they have been saying they are deploying new tech to resolve that problem. Well they said that new tech is what is allowing the cross-server LFG, and by the time 3.3 is out (with the new LFG) the instances problem will be fixed too.</div></div><hr />

interesting about the attunements though, they could make the attunement simply an epic quest that gives an item like the Black temple necklace, but not needing to do the attunement to enter the instance, just to get a certain key item.

I think (this wasn't said) that it will be possible whispering (or adding to friends) a character's name or a battle.net account's name. With that only your friends should be able to reach you anywhere.</div></div><hr />

WAHCASUALSWAHWAHWAH!!!!<br />
<br />
i`m a semi-hardcore raider and it`s nice to farm heroics outside of raiding for runed orbs that sell for 300-400g each, and sometimes it`s hard to find groups. i`ll be really nice to join a group and instantly find a group.<br />
<br />
and yeah, it`ll probably similar to a BG. you queue as a tank/dps/healer, and then when the group is formed or you invite the people (if it works like that) you`ll enter into the instance, since they obviously can`t be teleported from their server to your server, the only way is similar to a BG.<br />
<br />
so STFU about &quot;catering to casuals&quot; and accept a good thing when it happens, you GD crybaby.</div></div><hr />

compared to the previous expansions, not really much. Of course they could add dungeons during the expansion,<br />
but TBC and WotLK had around 12-15 dungeons with release. Of course, if you've only 5 levels to go,<br />
you don't need 15 dungeons. But at the same time, you've heroic versions of every instance. This means less instances to farm at max level.<br />
<br />
Another thing I don't really get is the 'Pug leader reward'. It's not really worth a reward if you you complete an instance with a pug imo.<br />
Everyone wants to be the leader if the reward is going to be useful, because being a pug-leader doesn't seem a really hard job.<br />
Bringing a pug to the end of the instance is a job for every single member in the group, if you are only rewarding the leader (who's nearly always the tank)<br />
for it, this will be unfair for the others. Can anyone explain this? Did they say something more about this during the live stream?</div></div><hr />

The way it sounds, there'll be approximately 10-12 dungeon instances, the two old school heroics, and four raids on launch.</div></div><hr />

They said FOR A FACT that they have the tech to fix &quot;more instances...&quot; ITS DONE. They just have to impliment it. Oh and hey guess what? In the process of fixing it, they figured out this cool new feature where we can bring in other server players to our instances. Even if there was absolutely NO reward for the leader, this feature would be amazing. no more LF tank or LF Heals for hours on end at non-peak hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WTF?<br />
so you actually enjoy the time wasted sitting in LFG when there aren't any guildies on to run heroics? Do you think having more time to waste NOT actually playing the game makes you a better player? This will help everyone, from the most casual to the most hardcore. All this will do is give you a bigger pool of players to group with, so there is less downtime, and more actual PLAY time. <br />
<br />
Also, this will make the idea of leveling an alt even more exciting, should make getting a group for all the leveling dungeons much easier, I can't wait to see this.</div></div><hr />

and what exactly is your problem with casuals?! If you are a hardcore in a hardcore guild you don't even get to see casuals in your group, you go to your raid/bg/arena/whatever with all the other leet players and casuals go with other casuals... why do you get affected by them I dont get it.. pure old retardness?! nah an uber player cant be a troll can he?!</div></div><hr />

* It will come with its own reward systems. If you're the leader of a PUG and complete the dungeon successfully you will be rewarded.<br />
<br />
This will never work. People will hold their PUG ransom to be made lead at the end of an instance; and then they'll un-invite people they don't like when the last boss is at 1%. This will be a huge headache! Just make it a transparent feature, where you can join with a partial premade (like battlegrounds) or solo, and fill up the slots.<br />
<br />
I hope this is implemented for dungeons and raids, includes a gear rating system (at some level of transparency), etc.<br />

<br />
If all folks use the same bank of servers for a particular instance (e.g. Old Kingdom) regardless of the realm their toon calls home, then server allocation can be based on demand for that instance globally... same performance to all users and easier to scale up or down as demand changes. Just because you don't see the fix, doesn't mean it's not there.<br />

Correct on x-realm LFG having little to no impact on instance play. If anything it makes it even easier for blizz ops to load balance across the servers based on demand trends. <br />
<br />
Want a more interesting issue? Summoning an x-realmer to your instance unless the summon stones are moved inside the zone-in portal. They could do that easy enough, just dont know what their plans are yet.<br />
<br />
The ninja issue is nonsense at best. No one &quot;needs&quot; anything other than rep and badges from 5-mans to get geared for raids. SOP will be need roll everything and pray for nice RNG or develop friends x-realm that you can rely on to greed when appropriate. <br />
<br />
PUG raids will remain master looted just like they are right now on single realm... /roll to your hearts content; doesnt mean you'll get shit. Hell, the guilds I've been with master loot also -- ninja problems are self-induced.</div></div><hr />

It will definitely make levelling our new goblin/worgen/new class-race combo rerolls a lot easier, I think, to be able to run dungeons along the way without having to wait for hours.<br />
<br />
Getting groups is rarely hard on my server (at 80 I&quot;m talking about now) though you might wait 10 mins extra or so to find a tank or healer. I think it's fantastic that we'll be able to help out the low pop servers on our battlegroup with finding groups and have the chance to make new friends. The new cross-server, cross-game friends list coming with Battle.Net will make that even more awesome.</div></div><hr />

From what i understand LFG across realms won't change anything, i'm sure the realms it looks across are the realms in your battlegroup and from what i understand everyone in the battlegroup already shares the same instance servers so it won't change the fact of too many instances occuring or not.</div></div><hr />

What with being a ninja's paradise and all. Even on my crappy low pop horde realm it is no problem to find a group. Well maybe if you're a dime a dozen DPS then it might be hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With 1) cross server communications (battlenet Real ID) 2) as people will mess around on free time in BGs and will do what they know (aka us healers) 3) with the constant QQ about the lack of healers accross all servers 4) and some of us have transferred servers.<br />
<br />
This has the potential to be bad for healers, we get spammed enough to heal this or that, this is just going to make it a lot worse for healers. I personally fear this.<br />
<br />
<br />
God forbid you have enough social skills to just say &quot;no&quot; or ignore tells. Besides, I don't believe these so called tales of being &quot;spammed&quot; to heal something, I have healers of every class this has never happened. Stop overblowing it because you feel threatened when purple text pops up.<br />
<br />
And seriously, bad? Part of being a healer is getting easy groups. But like I said above I don't need X-server LFG because getting a group on my realm is easy as it is anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe they will add some kind of &quot;Ninja Reputation&quot; thing. Just like feedback on ebay.<br />
This will help select the members.<br />
What do you think?<br />
<br />
<br />
[Big wall of text]Blizzard doesn't much like giving user too much power. Even when it comes to AFKers the best they give us is a the power to report them and if they get enough they receive a slap on the wrist... I mean a debuff that goes away faster then it was applied. It might work for botters. It would have better to just be a kick+vote system like in FPS games instead of a stupid debuff. You literally have to sit there and do nothing and then get the attention of your fellow players to get pissed at you to even start stacking reports on you. And then all they get is a dumb debuff. It's theorized it's this way because people are afraid of abuse in a democratic process! LOL Maybe they should they actually play FPS games, because most of the time people never get player-vote kicked unless they are being a huge butthole or are AFK and taking up a server slot (wow sounds familiar). [/Big wall of text]<br />
<br />
So while your idea sounds good, people will think its open to abuse because people can then e-bully you by spamming your character with bad eBay style feedback. Oh noes! Not like they can't falsely try to ruin your server reputation now anyway. Expecting the worse in people is sure way to design things.</div></div><hr />

They may spend barely any time playing but guess what. Blizzard doesn't charge people on how much they play. They still get their 15 bucks a month whether that person logs on for 30 minutes a month, or 30 days a month. You should know by now that Blizzard is just making to look money. I mean for fucks sake, look at Cataclysm. So far it honestly looks like they went on the WoW forums and copied and pasted every single casual players suggestion and reposted it.<br />

LF B-S class tank only for example* How about, how many times did he wipe the raid by facing a cone attacking boss at the raid, how many times did he stand in fire for 4 looooong seconds and die, how many times did he mess up the *hand off* by getting taunt on the DR at the wrong time etc etc etc. Pugging some random joe that hit 80 last week is no good for a player who is in full T8 looking for a quick easy run, there has to be a distinction built in the game or its just plain frustrating.</div></div><hr />

I dono about about what u say~ It's mostly the old vanilla hardcore + softcore players that wanted to see old world change. For those (me included) that started WOW since vanilla, we really want to see w/e we did from questing actually changed the world in one way or another. <br />
<br />
And in business perspective, the only way for blizz to make more money is to satisfy its customer. Nothing wrong in listening to the majority of the customer and trying to bring the vanilla players back. I am kind of disappointed with both bc and wotlk and now hope this will bring something back. Third time the charm... I hope.</div></div><hr />

You're right. Redesigning the entire old world is just a quick copy / paste job.<br />
Oh, and you're also right that they copied all the blizzard forums and made t just for casuals. <br />
<br />
Thats why they are doing HM's again (link your yogg 0 kill please), thats why they are releasing more content than they have ever done so before, along with more dungeons and raids than before. Clearly, they listened to only the &quot;casuals.&quot;<br />

I think it was fun and annoying at the same time. Storywise, it was great to get to MC raid entrance in BR as part of the attunement. It was fun to do the Onyxia chain. It was quite easy to attune for BWL. (probably devs didn't have enough time to design this one) I don't recally anything fun-attunement related in BC.</div></div><hr />

You've not tried to start the new Coliseum 10/25 hard modes without the achievements, then? Or how about Algalon, perhaps?<br />
Or how about the new Icecrown dungeon attunements they've announced? <br />
<br />
No, the difference is you now only need the 1 guy who'll speak to the NPC, or has the key, or whatever. Gone are the days when you needed EVERYONE to be keyed. THAT was the annoying part of TBC attunements- if it was enough for just the raid leader to be keyed, no-one would have cared - it was reasonable to expect a few core raiders to be attuned. But because everyone needed the key, you had to go back to the previous content to key up each new recruit every other week. That's what was horrible about TBC attunements.<br />
<br />
As marco posted above, it's entirely possible that they'll tie in some new attunements in with the guild achievement/leveling system. This would allow guild-wide attunement to certain dungeons. Which is something people have been asking for since TBC. And yes, it would be easy, to implement, in fact it'd be exactly the same as the Coliseum hard modes attunement.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure what everyone is complaining about, there is a simple solution...Master Loot. I almost never do 5 mans outside of my guild, but if I do I ALWAYS set it to master loot. Problem solved. If someone does not like that, then they don't need to come, they are not obligated. If the master looter ninja's something, then open a ticket and report him, easy fix.<br />
<br />
And what servers are you on where the &quot;Alliance:Horde ratio is the same&quot;? I have played on 5 realms, and that ratio has never been the same...the Alliance always outnumber the horde.</div></div><hr />

gm's don't tend to deal with ninja issues since they say it's a community issue unless the person has used an exploit<br />
<br />
i play on my tank normally so land up leading groups but even then i'm still rather :s about how blizz will deal with complaints about ninjas, imagine an onyxia pug and she drops 310% mount, bam gone with it but you can't even get them blacklisted on the server from guilds unless you chase after them<br />
<br />
not quite sure of a solution either since a rating system will get abused by people who have had a non-argument over something like someone winning a roll throughout or something stupid</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? I have reported people for ninja'ing before (among other things, language, etc), and although Blizzard does not disclose any action taken, I know of at least 2 people who are no longer on the realm, be it by ban or whatever. With that said, I can understand why Blizz would not want to get involved.<br />
<br />
Either way, master loot. I am of the understanding that this is for 5 mans only, and even if it did apply to larger 10/25 man raids, I try to avoid bringing a pug to those as much as possible. But I of course understand that not everyone is in the position to have a guild large enough to complete this content without pug's.<br />
<br />
Overall it is a good idea. A good idea that solves problems should not be held back because of what-ifs and speculation. Sure there will be problems, but handle those as they arise.</div></div><hr />

Yo, did you guys know about this cool feature called &quot;master loot&quot;? I heard it's going to be implemented into the game before cross server LFG...oh, wait.<br />
<br />
Now, if someone is going to be creating groups to ninja loot, you'd have the same problem on all realms equally. People who wouldn't normally ninja aren't going to ninja simply because someone is from a different server.<br />
<br />
If they do create the group to ninja, and get away with it, visit your battlegroup forums and post a warning. There's no protection from ninjas now, there's no difference.<br />
<br />
It's the risk of pugging. The only way to prevent it EVER is to start the group yourself.</div></div><hr />
