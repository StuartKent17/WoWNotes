Warlords of Draenor Developer Interviews<br />
There were a few developer interviews at the recent press events, so today we are taking a look at an interview with Alex Afrasiabi from games.on.net (http://games.on.net/2014/03/looting-housing-and-pushing-the-level-cap-we-visit-blizzard-to-check-out-warlords-of-draenor/). <br />
<br />
<br />
There is no guarantee that all character models will be done by release, but they hope to have most ready.<br />
The biggest thing stopping players from coming back is leveling. <br />
As the game got older, more and more content was added, which makes it harder for people to catch up when they return.<br />
Having to deal with all of the other things that are a part of coming back to the game along with leveling is too much for some people.<br />
When you come back to the game and use a boost, your bars are cleared, talents unlearned, <br />
The team also looked at significantly increasing experience rates rather than offering a boost, but it didn't feel great and the boost was the better option.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor - New Blingtron<br />
It looks like Engineers will be getting a new Blingtron (http://wowpedia.org/Blingtron_4000) in Warlords of Draenor, but not a new mount (https://twitter.com/TheCrafticus/status/448990251537547264).<br />

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/gb-en.png Official Class Roles Forums Closing (EU)<br />
Hello everyone, <br />
<br />
So that player discussions remain concentrated in existing forums where they receive more attention from other players, we have made the decision to retire the following forums. These forums will be deactivated next week: <br />
<br />
Damage Dealing (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/896511/)<br />
Healing (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/896512/)<br />
Tanking (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/896513/)<br />
<br />
In preparation for their final closure, these forums will remain accessible in Read Only mode, but will be removed permanently on 8 April 2014. If you wish to save any relevant information, please do so before then.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Will New Veng buff self heals? Dev team's goal for value of Bonus Armor vs other stats (situational or always good)?<br />
Yes, it'll buff self heals. Bonus Armor is always good, except the extremely rare case where you're taking no physical damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444179300934094848))<br />
Or the damage bypasses armor.<br />
I think having physical-flagged damage that bypasses armour is a silly design. Just use magic to do it.<br />
Not at all. Bleeds, sonic spells, etc... All totally make sense as non-magic but not reduced by armor. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444195530172682240))<br />
OK I'll give you those! But what about things like Malkorok's Blood Rage. It is an obvious physical weapon attack.<br />
Balance. We don't want to hit clothies harder than plate/shield wearers for that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444197034073919488))<br />
<br />
haste, that you'd get the 84 damage in exactly 14 seconds, with the partial tick appearing 14.0s after cast (6 DPS).<br />
Yes, duration never changes. You'll get the partial tick at 14sec after cast. DPS won't have breakpoints. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444969364446380032))<br />
Are you still planning to give everyone a Pandemic mechanic?<br />
Yes, but 130% duration max, not 150%. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444972903159713792))<br />
So if you recast way before the first partial tick, will you end up with &quot;queued&quot; partials?<br />
No, partial ticks are only when the dot falls off before its' next scheduled tick. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444974470722113539))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
do you know how current dodge/parry stats on items will be changing in 6.0? Should I stockpile them &quot;just in case&quot;?<br />
They'll be replaced with other useful stats. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444334736626814976))<br />
<br />
I knew that Cleave got dropped. I thought socket/multistrike/readiness were all rare 'bonus tertiaries' in WoD. Got a source?<br />
No, Multistrike and Readiness are full, legitimate secondary stats, like Haste/Crit/Mastery. Socket is a bonus tertiary. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444206840667066368))<br />
still wondering how you're gonna make Multistrike appeal to tanks.<br />
Been working on that recently. Nothing to announce yet, but it'll be spec-specific passives that interact with multistrike. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444552553888362496))<br />
so things like grand crusader, revenge, Crimson scourge?<br />
Yeah, that style of ability (though different effects). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444600725285253121))<br />
<br />
Does everyone have a baseline level of Multistrike / Readiness, like Crit &amp; Mastery, or is it possible to have 0, like Haste?<br />
Zero baseline. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444608388475805696))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
How were Large Anima Golems supposed to be used in the Dark Animus encounter, especially on heroic?<br />
To buy you more time on the enrage. But they ended up being too dangerous/disruptive to make it worth the benefit. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/441617682006151168))<br />
<br />
Could some indication that a spell is armor ignoring physical be added to the DJ? It is occasionally unclear.<br />
It's certainly something we can do a better job of calling out when it comes to tank mechanics. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/444199433689788417))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Will we see any balance changesonce the new PvP Gear shows its full effect ?<br />
Perhaps. At this point we will only be able to do hotfixes which limits our options. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/444161261257773056))<br />
<br />
Any chance we could see TB and WG put in as 40v40 BGs so they are full?<br />
More focused on building Ashran. WG and TB had their time to shine. It would take a lot of work to restore them properly. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/444182264453156864))<br />
<br />
Hard to get conquest losing in flag cap RBGs compared to losing in an AB-style RBG. Intended? Flag cap = so black and white.<br />
It's the nature of CTF. You're comparing a map with a score of 3 to a map with a score of 1600. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/444362032171601920))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor<br />
Any plans on making Thorim soloable for everyone?<br />
Changed in 6.0: Thorim won't trigger the deathball/reset when his arena is empty. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443478029667278848))<br />
Valithria is soloable, not sure what is wrong.<br />
By, say, a warrior? Probably just going to make her skippable. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443480317681102848))<br />
Yeah, that was a joke (coming from a healer), but great to hear Ulduar/ICC are getting a look - how about Vezax?<br />
What's the concern with Vezax? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443482225426714625))<br />
Yeah, Vezax and the trash leading up to him won't be there. Need to soft reset.<br />
Fixed that also (in 6.0). Thanks. Could happen if you killed one of the Keepers very quickly. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443541773244063745))<br />

It says Fall of 2014. So probably not December. I'm guessing either October or November.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it is more of a precaution, like the models should be done by release. But incase they aren't they can go back &amp; say they never said they would all be done. When they really should all be done in time. Mostly just a covering ass thing, incase something happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn´t care, they are selling this expac with the new characters as a plus, so don´t having them for the release is an illegal move at least in Europe(selling things with misleading adversiting), they are fooling the clients with that publicity!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is psychological to some extent. A new player today would see 90 levels and think based off other games involving leveling that such a task would take far too long. An ex player from say BC or Wrath will remember how long it took for them to get to end level after the last previous point and think that because it's 2-3 expansions behind that it would also take a long time and opt out of it. In all things, the first impression is often the lasting one. Whether that impression is based off all the facts or not is largely irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

except they already said the same thing in blizzcon, mentioning that, maybe, not all models will be ready at release but that they hope to finish before the release comes.</div></div><hr />

Originally the boost wasn't for money. It was changed to a 60 dollar for each 90 after free with WoD boost because a player at blizzcon pointed out that people would just buy multiple boxes to get more 90's.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I'm sure that's when it dawned on blizzard.<br />

<br />
If they reduced the experience needed to level any lower, you'd spend more time traveling to a zone that's relevant to your level than actually playing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Faster leveling&quot; isn't going to grab as many vets as &quot;free level 90&quot; will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm sure that's when it dawned on blizzard.<br />
<br />
Considering they thought that making harder heroics would be a good idea for group finder groups and also that making a fuck ton of dailies would be good for end game content, it's not exactly too far fetched to believe they didn't think of it straight up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Vanilla manual was full of stuff that wasn't actually in at launch like Dwarf mages.<br />
The box for Wrath lists new dance moves and aerial combat as included features.<br />
<br />
They aren't going to get in trouble with the law for possibly needing to patch some things in later.<br />

Then I shall ask.. why do you care?<br />
<br />
No seriously, if it is a game you haven't touched in 4 years why do you feel the need to burst a blood vessel yelling about them on the forums?<br />
<br />
Do you not have better things to do in your life or are you that pathetic that you spend your time getting angry over things you hate on a forum dedicated to the thing you hate?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh, I'm still of the personal opinion that Blizzard is saying 'Fall 2014' to give themselves wiggle room, because if we do see a September release date or later, that's an entire year with no new content, something Blizzard has stated that they've been wanting to seriously avoid repeating after Wrath, and to a lesser extent, Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

You quit four years ago? Why.. are you still on a forum for WoW?<br />
<br />
IF I were to quit, I'd just quit and be done with it all. People like you confuse me to no end as to why you must come around bashing something you no longer play and obviously don't care about anymore.</div></div><hr />

So you are going nuts and getting mad over something that does not concern you anymore since you stopped playing so long ago, how about you just go away since what happens in WoW now really does apply to you anymore..<br />

How long have you been playing WOW? They have said the same thing with the same vague &quot;no guarantees&quot; about every single thing they've ever done or made. So you've been fine with it until now. Just pretend you still are as ignorant as usual.</div></div><hr />

I find this highly unlikely. But, I don't have their internal data, so maybe it's true.<br />
<br />
<br />
As the game got older, more and more content was added, which makes it harder for people to catch up when they return.<br />
That's why you keep adding more and more catch up mechanics. Not a way to bypass the entire experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having to deal with all of the other things that are a part of coming back to the game along with leveling is too much for some people.<br />
Then why exactly are they playing the game? They just want to skip it all and go straight to the end?<br />
<br />
<br />
They team also looked at significantly increasing experience rates rather than offering a boost, but it didn't feel great and the boost was the better option.<br />
That is truly the most pathetic excuse I've heard coming from a developer interview in a long time. They could have cut the amount of time to hit required to hit max level in half or even more if they wanted to! Anything else to make the experience &quot;less painful&quot; than just saying &quot;swipe your credit card and we'll give you a raid-ready, level capped character instantly!&quot;<br />
<br />
They were worried about the earlier zones feeling dead, so they implemented cross-realm zone. CRZ was completely in vain when they implemented level 90 boost. And I know not everyone will use the boost, but so far, apparently over a hundred thousand already have. That's a lot less people populating those low level zones!<br />
<br />
This should not have been added to the game until WoD was launched. And even then, having a level 90 character should be a requirement before you can boost another character to 90; just like how you needed a lvl 55 character to make a Death Knight.<br />
<br />
What's the matter Blizz? Sub numbers looking a little bit low going into the new expansion, had to artificially boost your profits for the next shareholder meeting? Also, don't forget the fact that despite all of this, they are charging us $10 more for the expansion.</div></div><hr />

Honest answer would be the game is 10 years old and the genre really offers nothing new so we along with everyone else lose subs. Also if they release the game later than the 10th anniversary I'd be shocked. Sometime around there would give them enough time to get things ready and make the launch kinda special?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is your opinion on this matter then?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's why you keep adding more and more catch up mechanics. Not a way to bypass the entire experience.<br />
<br />
Then, by making catch up mechanics for 1-90 will simply destroy the experience for those who DO like to level and quest. The boost up mechanic is out there, it's a gift to people who know what they're doing, and you don't even have to use it. Ever!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then why exactly are they playing the game? They just want to skip it all and go straight to the end?<br />
<br />
We're talking about returning players. So yes, they have experienced all of this, or at least ... most of it. And they left for a reason. Maybe they do not like one expansion content, such as for example Pandaria? returning players will simply want to go and start playing the expansion they just bought. So yes, exactly.<br />
Now, it is an option for new players, but I'd never use that boost as a new player unless I have friends on end game to play with. But that's just me I guess. I like to play the game I pay for, and paying for like.. 4 expansions including the main game just for 10 levels? I don't think any sane new player will agree to that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That is truly the most pathetic excuse I've heard coming from a developer interview in a long time. They could have cut the amount of time to hit required to hit max level in half or even more if they wanted to! Anything else to make the experience &quot;less painful&quot; than just saying &quot;swipe your credit card and we'll give you a raid-ready, level capped character instantly!&quot;<br />
<br />
Why would they do that? What if someone wants to enjoy leveling? Don't suggest things that only works for you. Leveling is too easy as it is, no need to make it a complete joke. People need to make effort when leveling a character, if they choose to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Technically as long as models are released DURING his xpac, there is no false advertising. All they said were &quot;new models.&quot; They never said they would be at release as far as I know. And this isn't the first time they have brought this up. At least this time we are actually getting them. I for one, appreciate the fact that they are even bothering to upgrade the models, and I realize that takes time and resources. Meanwhile someone else is complaining about how &lt;random element&gt; is not getting the attention they think it should because they are busy upgrading models. Limited resources and the inability to make everyone happy all of the time? I think they are doing an awesome job.</div></div><hr />

You pissed me off in 7AM! You mad bro?<br />
<br />
Before you even starting making any post and accusing someone, why don't you check is that even true? As I saw they announce new models in WoD (not on release date).<br />
<br />
Later in comments you wrote &quot;I stopped playing 4 years ago?&quot;. WTF you even care about this? If active players (Like me and majority of ppl that comment) don't really care about this, why are you mad?<br />
<br />
Blizzard is full of liars and lazy fucks? I never had so much exp with devs and I rly can't comment that, but I posted tons of tickets in my WoW game life and I can't remember that I got same GM twice, or even via skype before they switch on phone callback. They are doing their job, only you think that is easy..<br />

So they put a whopping $60 price tag on it. I am battling to see how that is going to encourage players to return. Yes, I know about the 1 free level 90. Returning players better pick wisely because once you click that button it's $60 to change your mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
uhu charge for a boost or update the experience rates for free..<br />
<br />
cant say im surprised they went with the money option<br />
<br />
it is free with the expansion for returning players. They could have done bonus exp with the xpansion and sold exp potions in the store, it would have been the same thing, right? Just because they could have gone with a different FREE option doesn´t mean they wouldn´t have added a pay option in the store. <br />

<br />
They are right about increase EXP rates even more. Already if you have heirlooms it feels stupid to level. You start in a zone, and by the time you are halfway through, you are doing grey quests. I know it is impossible to convince people.. but if they increased exp rates even more, then you would have to do like 5 quests in a zone, get all the intro quests done.. then go do a different zones first 5 quests. You throw in the monk buff and rested exp. you would literally be doing grey quests before you could finish the first quest hub in each zone.<br />
<br />
Also, it is just a pyschological thing. It doesn´t matter how fast the levels are, it still ´feels´ long telling an old player they have to level their 60 up to 90 to start the new content.<br />

I'M SO MAD OVER A PROMISE THEY NEVER MADE!!! GRaaghhghHGHHGHH!!!<br />
<br />
They say: &quot;New character models.&quot; So that means all they have to release is two new models. Although they don't promise more and it's all legal it's still pretty much misleading. People will obviously assume/think they will have new models on all their characters.<br />
<br />
I am also not entirely sure why you are fine with unfinished new models. The trailer also just says &quot;Build and upgrade your own garisson.&quot; If they release it unfinished (with lack of buildings or something) I guess you can't be upset either.</div></div><hr />

It fits in exactly with all the evidence of where their intentions lie with Warlords of Draenor. Their focus is on trying to bring back players who have left in the past and they are taking the current player base for granted and assuming they'll go along with whatever they do. Even if a lot of us do leave because of the changes &amp; delays they have convinced themselves old players will come back to the game if they make it harken back to the BC era. Everything they are doing...the item squish, 90 boosts, new character models, revisit to familiar BC era zones, Mythic difficulty, removal of flying, triage healing....it's all about bringing back nostalgic players.<br />
<br />
They have basically taken the approach that Ghostcrawler's era of Cataclysm/Mists and chasing casuals have driven away the hardcore player base &amp; they need a hard core focused expansion led by Alex Afriasabi (hardcore personified if you know his EQ background) to bring them back.<br />
<br />
It's going to be an interesting gamble to see if they can bring those people back &amp; at the same time risk losing a lot of the current player base. Grab some popcorn it's going to be interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is bullshit and a cop out. They could have easily made it so you could only have one boosted character per account. That if you tried to make a new account with a boosted 90 it wouldn't allow the account to be merged. They chose the money option, end of story.<br />

That's another thing that is laughably pathetic about all of this. If I were to start a new account right now the game wouldn't let me make a DK until I level to 55. (Yes that restriction is still in the game) But if I whip out my credit card and throw down $60 I can get to 90 without any restrictions.<br />

December 20 is the last day of Fall in the US at least (December 21 being the first official day of Winter), so they could technically have a release around Christmas and still keep their promise of Fall 2014. Kind of sad, really. <br />
<br />
And yes, I will be pretty disappointed if it takes them that long, the longest final tier yet, and we still don't have all the models done at release.

It's not inflation, don't be ignorant. Other games are NOT raising in prices, you know why? Cost is going down. They save a shit ton of money selling most of their copies digitally since they now no longer have to manufacture boxes, pay to ship them and have them taking up space on retail shelves. The extra $10 is because of the &quot;free&quot; boost. They sent out a survey asking if people would be cool with having to pay $10 extra for the expansion for the 90 boost. Inflation my ass.</div></div><hr />

They could have easily made it so you could only have one boosted character per account. That if you tried to make a new account with a boosted 90 it wouldn't allow the account to be merged. They chose the money option, end of story.<br />
<br />
Considering you chose to ignore the fact that even if they didn't sell the boost as a separate service you'd still have to pay to get the complimentary boost that comes with buying WoD in the first place, I'm not sure why you thought this was an altruistic move in the first place. <br />

There's a shit-ton of work that needs to be done on the models and they'll be done when they're done. No one from Blizzard has ever said they'd be ready when WoD launches. They've said they hope for that, the same as they said here.<br />
<br />
Lazy fucks is the best way to describe them, this expansion has only 2 new things added to the game and that's garrisons and new character models. Everything else is removing existing features. How exactly do you justify them not even being near beta 4 days away from April while making an expansion with more or less NOTHING new?<br />
<br />
They are sitting on their hands doing nothing, no beta, no &quot;huge info dump&quot; that they said they will give us, they are not even half way done with the character models.<br />

Eh, I'm still of the personal opinion that Blizzard is saying 'Fall 2014' to give themselves wiggle room, because if we do see a September release date or later, that's an entire year with no new content, something Blizzard has stated that they've been wanting to seriously avoid repeating after Wrath, and to a lesser extent, Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
So in other words it would be nothing new if it happens? They did it in last two expansions, why would you think they suddenly will start making expansions faster? They &quot;want to avoid it happening&quot; again but it already happened. They are just not as good as people think they are, they are probably half way done with WOD atm.</div></div><hr />

I'm not really sure you understand how the interwebs works. Consolidating rarely used forums into a smaller number of more used forums doesn't cut any costs. If anything there is a cost (although it'll probably be negligible in the grand scheme of things) in doing so.<br />

They are still part of the demographic this boost is apparently aimed at and the fact they spend their time on MMO-C complaining about everything means that they are a better target for Blizzard than those that have quit and turned back completely on WOW.

It's not illegal as it was clearly stated that not all models will be released at launch but through later patches.<br />

In that context it's perfectly legal.<br />

I also think they didn't expect Ghostcrawler leaving, and people forget, he coordinated a lot at the same time, so they could have had a setback.<br />

Meaning a August release could be September instead. We don't know that, but I really think personally, like you, september is most likely.</div></div><hr />

It's the slow, weekly-locked grind for gear on every character you get to max level. Catch-up mechanisms like Timeless Isle are a good start but leave you far too low to participate in any real raiding. <br />
<br />
I'd rather they go back to the last-patch model of WOTLK and Cata and give you a set of dungeons to grind that give you last tier's normal gear. I took a break during Cata after H-Firelands was on farm, came back halfway through Dragon Soul and was still able to get re-geared and clear heroic long before 5.0 hit thanks to the new instances dropping 378 gear. This time, I'm barely scraping at 543 ilvl and just starting normals through OpenRaid after almost 2 months of gear grind on my main and it doesn't feel like I'm going to take down H-Garrosh any time soon. Having to grind gear out through 4 versions of the same raid doesn't help either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uh, what opinions? &quot;WoW is gay. Boosts are gay&quot; is not an opinion. It's a trolling attempt. The people who are criticizing aren't offering real problems. They are offering subjectivity at every opportunity. They are being petty, childish, and really not thinking through their perceived grievances with the system, other than not agreeing with it. I don't take people who act this way seriously, and I will gleefully disregard their opinions unless it's followed up with a well thought out and thorough response as to why they disagree with something someone has done, and hopefully includes and alternative design. I was always taught to never complain about something, unless I came up with 3 alternative solutions. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Blizzard is attempting to provide real factual evidence as to why they went with boosts. Somebody who hasn't played since TBC can get right back into the game at level 90, and not have to fight with level 20 levels through content that is disjointed, and honestly, goes way fast. Giving them a free 90 before an expansion is a pretty good deal, and it defeats a lot of the problems that exist for people coming back to the game.<br />
<br />
Worst part is, most of the things you see about it are detractors. You don't see people who have used the feature to reconnect with their friends talking about it, because they are in game having fun. Furthermore, more people go to forums to bitch about things, rather than commend them. You should know this, because you post on a forum. MMO champ and the Official forums are full of negativity and toxicity. People mad about the most inane things, that shouldn't even cause a problem.<br />
<br />
As a WoW player, I don't care about the boosts. If it gets more people back into the game play, that's a good thing. The only thing I'm upset with is Blizzards execution of the pricing scheme. In this case, I think that the upfront investment is also a major barrier in returning to the game. Currently they are making you buy MoP, and WoD + 15$ sub to get back into the game. Effectively, you're looking at 20 + 50 + 15 in the US. 85$ to play a game for 1 month? No, not really. In fact, that's 25$ more than infamous second son, and I get to play it longer than a month. The cost barrier to entry, is my personal biggest issue with the game.<br />
<br />
If I was Blizzard, I would bundle the entire system as 1. If you buy Warlords of Draenor, you get everything. Vanilla, TBC, WotLK, Cata, MoP, WoD, all for 50$. If you are a new player, you get 1 month free. In addition, if your account has been inactive for more than 12 months straight, you get 1 free month. They would also still get the level 90 boost for anyone that purchases it. Point is, even if they only come back for a month, you get 50$ out of them. You'll get new players wanting to try out WoW, and you'll also get returning players who see a lower cost of entry. I don't know who is leading up the team at Blizzard, but I would definitely like to have a word with them. Lowering the cost of entry is going likely to bring more profits, not less.</div></div><hr />

It may be insane, but I'm sure they did a bit more research about this issue than you. At the moment you are just expressing a view point based solely your own opinion. I have no illusions that Blizzard is a company that is trying to make money, and maybe their research is incorrect, but if they believe that it will help bring people back to the game (to increase long term profits), they have every right to try it. <br />

Not having the character models ready at launch would be pretty terrible. One of the worst things a company can do when it comes to trust amongst the customer base is over promising and under delivering. This sets a pretty bad precedent in that regard. New character models are quite literally the second thing mentioned on the product page. Just behind the exploration of Draenor, but ahead of things like the level 90 boost and Garrisons. To call the new models one of the largest selling points would be putting it mildly.<br />
<br />
Also, with the increase in expansion cost, there exists a certain expectation that Blizzard should be delivering an outstanding product. And maybe they will. I certainly hope so. But warnings like this one don't give a lot of hope. Will we have a situation where, say, every race has been updated except for Trolls? And then they have to wait for the first content update to expect their model upgrade? Luck of the draw on whether or not your character will have an expected feature at product launch isn't good execution. If a promised feature as important as this one isn't ready at launch, honestly that's just representative of poor product planning, which is something that a company like Blizzard should never have as an issue.</div></div><hr />

Quite so. A somewhat recent example of this would probably be GTA 5 Online. Heists were a big deal with it, were even showed off briefly in the multiplayer gameplay trailer, yet, here we are, over 6 months later and they're nowhere to be seen. Rockstar was a trusted developer who pretty much always came through, so I'm interested in seeing what sort of effects it has had.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Blizzard has always operated under the mentality of when it's done, it's done. They've always taken fucking forever to do anything and apparently, that isn't what people care about anymore. They mistake that for laziness - and apparently would rather have rushed, buggy looking messes just so they can have their expansion.</div></div><hr />

Even if it takes you 1 month to make a cake, in the end it must be done.<br />
You cant take 6 months to make the perfect cake, people will starve waiting.<br />
So here is not a matter anymore of perfection (its not since long). It's a matter of marketing and money flows.<br />
<br />
The game stopped being about quality long ago, just look at the care they've put in sets compared to the tier 2-3 as a small example.<br />
With this I'm not willing to open a huge discussion, its just my opinion ofc, but the lack of open communication and the general lack of feeling saddens me deeply.<br />
<br />
MMO champion used to post a lot of info about wow and generally about MMO's<br />
Now we see more often just random statistics to fill in the page and generally infos about other wow games, don't get me wrong, i play them sometimes but i come here for MMO news, not some other game.<br />
<br />
All this together shows a clearer picture, but again, its just my tought :) <br />
No offense to who thinks differently</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm actually fine with &quot;when it's done, it's done&quot;. I think that Blizzard should absolutely release a finished, polished product. That being said, releasing something where a promised feature, and an important one at that, isn't fully implemented, doesn't really reflect that. I don't think laziness is the issue at all. Blizzard is full of incredibly talented, dedicated people. People that want to put out an amazing product. For example: I think Reaper of Souls is a phenomenal product, and I can really see all the things I love about Blizzard in it.<br />
<br />
But there is something about WoD that isn't clicking, and I think some of that falls into a strange laissez faire attitude that the team is giving off. They are making some pretty big game design decisions that are causing some heads to turn. Now, I'm more than willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I can also understand why people would be concerned. But when they start saying things like a promised feature might not be 100% ready at launch, I have to wonder exactly how strong their product planning is.</div></div><hr />

logic fail.<br />
<br />
its not free blizz did a survey asking if they wanted to pay extra for the xpac which included a level 90 boost or not most ppl said they dont mind thus the extra $10 on the xpac i only wish theyd offer both for people that dint want it and judging by thse fourms i can see that im the not the only 1 that didnt want the extra 90</div></div><hr />

Ok, instead of free it's heavily discounted with the expansion and included in the price. It's still not something they're specifically buying or paying $60 for.</div></div><hr />

New character models was one of the big features for WOD...so now all that's left is what? Garrisons? More Orcs? Was there anything else was was considered a big feature? Their announcements have been so forgettable that I..you guessed it...forgot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO all these &quot;features&quot; are gimmicks that they waste to much time on. They seem like a great idea at the start but never really live up to expectations. In the end most players want content in the form of things to kill. And lets be honest its not all that hard for them to keep rehashing old models and similar mechanics to put together random_raid_boss_142.<br />
<br />
I think biggest selling points are new classes, followed by races, then comes content in the form of 5-mans / heroics / raids. Everything else is just something to keep us busy playing around with for a month till we are bored out of minds with it.</div></div><hr />

Or, the task requires more time than is available between now and release. It might be enough, but anything can slip 5-10% -- equating to weeks of lateness on a project this big. This isn't really that hard to imagine.</div></div><hr />

They said &quot;new player models&quot; in the trailer, not &quot;all player models will be updated at launch&quot;. They clearly have shown progress on several races and keep updating the playerbase once they have more to show, so calm down with the hyperbole.</div></div><hr />

From my point of view it would have been much better to give very high XP bonus (500 - 1000% and including Crafting bonuses) on weekends to actually get ppl to play the content. Why on earth is BLizzard spending this much time doing WOD leveling content if they are then just going to skip it with boosts? Why not do more dungeons then that would actually teach players how to play their boosted class and spec BEFORE they go into 25 man content?<br />

For those that are really pissed off, I would advise you to unsub if you are not happy with the service you are getting to justify the money you are spending just like I have. To the people defending blizzard good for you because you are standing up for a company, that you not only care about but enjoy their product and I am in no position to tell you otherwise.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day what really annoys me is that blizzard is being very hypocritical and expecting us to sympathize with them. On the one hand they tell us that having no flying to start the new expansion will take away this amazing and &quot;savage&quot; experience, but on the other hand they are clearly saying that leveling is annoying from 1-90. So that means I'm not going to be annoyed leveling from 90-100 so lets boost everyone else once again. In every expansion pack i have played i have yet to see all zones before i got to max level and that is not our fault, that is clearly a design problem, with this game and many other MMO's on the market.</div></div><hr />

So you would rather they hold on to a completed game and delay release just because a couple models arent finished? That would be asinine. Im glad you arent in charge. Id rather they release it early with no models and patch them in as they get done</div></div><hr />

I'm totally with you!! this is what makes me angry! yeah they said They may not have all the models out by release date but that was for the draenei and the blood elf because they were 2 years ahead of the vanilla models.

Lol, FLAWLESS LOGIC. FLAWLESS.<br />
*sarcasm off*<br />
No it doesnt, it just shows us you're raging really hard over a promise that never existed.<br />
<br />
<br />
They are still part of the demographic this boost is apparently aimed at and the fact they spend their time on MMO-C complaining about everything means that they are a better target for Blizzard than those that have quit and turned back completely on WOW. So why do you feel the need to dismiss and belittle their opinions?<br />
<br />
It is no more insane than expecting someone who has not played WOW since Wrath is going to hand over money for MOP and WOD to play a game they stopped playing over four years ago.<br />
<br />
Criticisms that are not constructive hold no value. Take a look around you:<br />
<br />
&quot;Blizzard is now full of liars and lazy fucks!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, everyone is waiting for information on WoD and we have to wait for new content for a year and we get some shitty interview about level 90 boosts?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, no one at Blizzard could possibly think of that right away... :S. No wonder people call eachother Blizzard apologists on here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Lazy fucks is the best way to describe them, this expansion has only 2 new things added to the game and that's garrisons and new character models. Everything else is removing existing features. How exactly do you justify them not even being near beta 4 days away from April while making an expansion with more or less NOTHING new? They are sitting on their hands doing nothing, no beta, no &quot;huge info dump&quot; that they said they will give us, they are not even half way done with the character models.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your argument is invalid. While there are some good arguments here and there, it's mostly ignorant people, or bigots swarming around here with destructive things to say about Blizzard that in no way helps them. Same with on the official forums. People just attacking blizzard without anything good to say need to lie down and die. They are ruining the game themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It is equally insane to defend everything a company does as well, it goes both ways.<br />
<br />
They are no more defending than you are attacking. There's nothing wrong with showing someone a positive perspective opposed from the constant negative one you folks seem to have about everything.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Seems funny most game studios can put out a whole game with hundreds of models in less time than its taken to get these models done. Blizzard takes their time with models so they can get shit done right. Everyone knows that. Also, what sets Blizz apart is the fact that:<br />
<br />
1. Blizzard just got their hands on this new engine<br />
2. Those companies didnt have a toxic community of haters crawling up their ass who are so impatient for the game that they would rather ask for unfinished models.<br />
3. These models need to support a wide range of computers that still goes back to those big clunkers from 05 when the game released.<br />
4. There are atleast 8-10 of these models getting done which is more than what blizzard does in a normal expansion. You could say that they're practically working overtime to get this shit out.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard not releasing everything at launch=/= Blizz removing features.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I agree that hyperbole of that nature isn't warranted, nor is it constructive. But...<br />
<br />
This line of thinking is silly. It also doesn't say that leveling in Draenor will be 100% complete, that dungeons and raids will be available at launch, that garrisons will have 100% functionality, or that they'll have finished the new talents.<br />
<br />
They have heavily promoted new character models as one of, if not THE biggest feature of the expansion. It is one of the big items on their product page. Having a key feature not implemented fully at launch, especially of this magnitude would be a pretty big fail. Imagine if BC launched with Draenei but no Blood Elves until the first patch. Or WotLK launching with the Death Knight starter quest incomplete. Or... Well, you get the point.<br />
<br />
If everyone is running around with shiny new character models except for say, male Trolls and female Night Elves, that's pretty bad. Their product planning should take the time frame into account, and if that can't meet their ship date for this massive feature, they really need to analyze what went wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Listen, I think people are way overreacting, but you are really reaching on these. First off, models do not depend on engines, 3d modelers build and animate them outside of the engine. <br />
<br />
Secondly, your comment 2) makes no sense as a &quot;community of toxic haters&quot; should have no impact on modelers, none what-so-ever. This game has 8 million players, if a modeler on their own goes to a place like MMO Champion, they will hear a lot more trash about how the game sucks than the models. This is just something a very small percentage of people are angry about today, not yesterday not tomorrow. <br />
<br />
Thirdly, your three is no more relevant than your first point. Before they even started they would have had a poly count goal.<br />
<br />
Finally, your last point is just something you are making up. You have no clue what their work rate should be and what it is. The person you are responding to is correct, smaller studios get models out a lot faster rate that are low rez (as these new models are even with the revamp).<br />
<br />
Again, I don't really care if not every model is done in time, but let's not bend over backwards making excuses why they aren't done either, because Blizzard really doesn't have a valid excuse on this one.</div></div><hr />

With so many talented fans churning out an endless stream of high quality WoW-themed artwork, what the hell is the deal with the Blizzard TCG updated art gallery? All 10 of these new submissions are absolutely mediocre (at best)...<br />
<br />
Their quite Shit really - mediocre is the original models/textures for the trees...</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a returning player I could see they are right. <br />
<br />
A returning player does not need to crawl through X levels and 2 expansions worth of old content that is no longer relevant.<br />
More so, ... the game turned into an extrema large and very confusing kind of game play for a gamer that took a break in the last 3-4 years.<br />
<br />
So the only thing to do is set out a complete new starting point for those players at the start of the next expansion. Everyone gets to start the adventure in WoD at lvl 90.<br />
<br />
Best thing to do.</div></div><hr />

The biggest problem on this site seems to be that individuals take their own experiences as the collective experiences of hundreds of thousands or even millions of people, and if anything that is outside those experiences is bullshit.</div></div><hr />
