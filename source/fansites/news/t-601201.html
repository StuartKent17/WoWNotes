This is a fake, do not trust this screenshot.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-04-15, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, it's from an emulated server and I guess you can even be friendly to Kael'thas here if you want. <br />
Second, you may have to do quests for Illidan for your attunement as I said in the Black Temple preview.<br />
Third, why wouldn't you be able to talk to him before the fight ? He used to be a nice guy.</div></div><hr />

Sorry for being so childish but Illidan is the only warcraft character I actually like ::)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-04-15, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I can't answer precisely. He's been bad and all, tried to destroy the world, but I don't know why players would want to kill him. <br />
He's still the guy who command(ed) Lady Vashj and Kael'thas tho, pretty good reason to want him dead.</div></div><hr />
