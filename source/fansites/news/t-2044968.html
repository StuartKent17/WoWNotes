Getting a Boost to Level 100<br />
With the advent of Legion, players who purchase the expansion are able to boost one character instantly to level 100. To help enhance the experience, we’ve introduced a new way to become familiar with your newly boosted character.<br />
<br />
Players who boost a character to level 100 will now be placed into a brief tutorial experience which will help teach some of the core abilities of the class. This experience will start with a pre-selected specialization which can be easily changed at the completion of the tutorial.<br />
<br />

<br />
Gunships of the Broken Shore<br />
Whether you’re Horde or Alliance, you’ll begin your new adventure on a gunship that’s patrolling the Broken Shore. Your new trainer will guide you along the way as you become familiar with your new class providing you with opportunities to practice against several enemies.<br />
<br />
Tip for Veterans: If you’re sure of your abilities with your newly boosted class, you can skip the experience (Are you sure?) by simply getting a flight from a Gryphon on the gunship. (Really sure?) This will move you on to the next part of your adventure.<br />
<br />
Once you’ve completed the brief experience on the gunship, it’s time to move on to the Broken Shore to truly begin testing your mettle against the Burning Legion.<br />
<br />
*Additional character boosts can also be purchased within the Shop.<br />

Legion Collector's Edition<br />
I felt this is very unfair as the hard copy of the collector's edition would be more expensive and require much earlier reservation compare to the digital copy.<br />
<br />
I hope this issue can be address since it is a big set back for all of the dedicated player who waits for the hard copy. I don't mind paying full upfront as well, as long as we can get the same perk as other people.<br />
Understandable, Tumontis, unfortunately those pre-orders could not be set up to allow it to be tied to your Battle.net account until you actually receive the copy of the game. As others mentioned you can purchase the digital version now and get a replacement key when you add your Collector's Edition. Obviously that is not an ideal solution but it is the one that we currently have available. <br />
<br />
Any feedback you may have on Legion pre-order/pre-purchase options and the early access to Demon Hunters should be posted in the General Discussion forum or through the in-game interface option. I'm afraid CS has no involvement there but I can assure you that our Developers are very much aware of the limitations to this and hope to have better solutions going forward.

Outlaw Rogue -- Legion Beta Feedback<br />
In addition to the Roll the Bones changes, the damage of Run Through and Between the Eyes was increased (these will all be in upcoming hotfix notes).<br />
<br />
We've been monitoring the issue of rerolling Roll the Bones throughout beta. While we're okay with some possibility to gain damage from rerolling as an advanced tactic, we didn't want the reroll frequency or the potential DPS benefit to be as high as it was. The main way to make rerolling less of a potential benefit is to shift damage from Roll the Bones into the other combo point spenders that it competes with. We did that in today's hotfix. In the process, we also narrowed the variance between the six Roll the Bones buffs.<br />
<br />
Our expectation is that simulations or other idealized steady-DPS scenarios may still show a small gain from rerolling in some cases, but that in practical scenarios for the majority of players, it will not be an expected or required part of gameplay.

With countless worlds burning in the legion's wake, you answered the call. Yet these mortals in their ignorance, they've come to destroyed their own salvation. Our time is short.

I know right! We see so little of some of these NPCs and see so much of our own characters. It seems like it would make more sense to do the switch! I mean don't get me wrong I don't think Genn should look like garbage, but player models should look equally badass. Most armor looks so lame on a worgen because it isn't made to fit properly same story as Tauren... its like the expect you to go helmless.<br />
<br />
I also didn't see Genn swaying in the wind as he walks like we are recreating &quot;Sound of Music&quot; either. Just sayin...</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't be surprised to see Sylvanas having outright abandoned the Alliance, but I expect it's more likely that there's a compelling reason for her leaving.<br />
<br />
I also find myself expecting that this whole Loa prophecy thing is a red herring. Prophecies in fiction are seemingly made to be misinterpretted. I would not be remotely shocked to see Sylvanas screw up a whole bunch of stuff on a prophecy saying Windrunner would save them only to have it turn out to have been Alleria with her supposedly showing up.<br />
<br />
Edit: And that's that. Makes sense. Didn't even consider the fact that the Alliance video gives us some obvious context with regards to Wrynn looking up on the ridge and seeing a horde of demons where the Horde had been.</div></div><hr />

This was something I used to think a lot about, as I would PvP on both sides, and while horde were always roaring for the horde (even outside of pvp), the alliance never had anything remotely similar.<br />
It would have been so easy to just write up some backstory around Lothar years ago and turn him into the Alliance's warcry (we've had numerous characters built from nothing into something over the years, Lothar lived a hero, died a hero, and it just boggles my mind that despite his huge statue in front of BR Mountain, being universally liked/respected, being the saviour of the alliance, and a powerful warrior, he's a virtual unknown to many alliance players)... which it even used to be as far back as Warcraft2! For Lothar! <br />
For Lothar even rolls off the tongue like for the horde, because the word can fall off into a roar - FOR LOTHAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRR, FOR THE HOOOOOOOOOOOOOORDE, see? It isn't possible to Roar for the alliance, because of all the syllables - al - lie - en - seh - and the way the word ends with a -seh which makes it impossible to lengthen, if you tried it'd either just come out as a long hiss if you emphasised the S sound, or a long whine if you emphasised the EN sound. <br />

becouse when there are 2 units defending lets say two sides of the bulding and one decides to retreat for whatever reason without telling the other they might sentence them to death as they will be atacked from the other side. So either we die together or make our escape together. otherwise it feals like Horde in this situation. honor-less. they basicly sacrificed alliance to make their escape</div></div><hr />

clearly aliance didnt know about that as evidence by their reaction<br />

Okay so see it like this; You're in a total clusterfudge which that was. You see that three of your leaders are pinned down, one suddenly gets stabbed and then you rush to that person which is in the middle of the battlefield. You're surrounded and you realize &quot;We're gonna die.&quot; so you stop and think &quot;Oh wait, brb bros. Just need to rush across the battlefield to shout down to the Alliance&quot; where Gul'dan is, screaming their retreat so that the enemy can prepare and lock them off. Realistically that isn't very smart. And if they didn't hear the signaling horn they probably wouldn't have heard them shout either tbh. :cool: It's not like Varian was the only &quot;victim&quot; since Vol'jin died as well.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but this is WoW. No doubt there'll be a &quot;uniting&quot; moment where Alliance players have to do a quest where they get shit talked by Sylvanas and have to beg for Horde help defeating the Legion, Jaina pussies out of wiping them out in revenge *again*, and Anduin says &quot;can't we all just be friends guys even though you keep stabbing us in the back?&quot; *again*.<br />
<br />
Like how is nobody in the second Horde video like &quot;huh, we really bitched out guys&quot;. Instead, Vol'jin is patting Sylvanas on the back when they just watched the Alliance almost get destroyed because of her foolishness. Hope Genn gets to take her head off this expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2016-08-09, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought it was interesting Varian died similarly to the way Durotan did in the movie: at Gul'dan's hand. Only Varian seems to have exploded while Durotan was sucked dry. Think it would have been more impactful when we set to attack the Tomb of Sargeras if we found Varian's dry corpse lying near his swords. So seems now that Varian's sarcophagus is empty. Blizzard could have done a quest on the Broken Shore at 110 where we retrieve Varian's remains and his swords for Anduin. Obviously would be Alliance only, though, although being done by Horde could be worked as a peace offering to the Alliance before the final attack on the Tomb. With the movie, though, I honestly felt Durotan's death was a bit ... lacking as was Llane's. While Varian's lead up to his death I thought was cool, his death itself was meh. The explosion was a bit much.<br />
<br />
Despite that, though, dead isn't always dead in this game. Blizzard brings people back all the time. Illidan and Gul'dan are just two recent examples but Kael'thas was one of the earliest ones. Muradin, Magni, Vanessa van Cleef, Onyxia, and Nefarian are others. Even the new horsemen for the DKs have two returning characters we thought were long dead. Although now I'm even more disappointed that Admiral Taylor got the shaft. Nazgrim got the better end of the stick. Even Tess Greymane is out of left field. She vanished during the Worgen intro and now she's back with no real reason as to why? I can't help but feel they're going to pigeonhole Anduin into marrying her ... especially since she's like the only other woman in the game. Jaina's old enough to be his mother at this point and every other woman is either non-human or dead.<br />
<br />
Still fails to explain why we don't get Varian's sword(s) as an artifact. Would have been fun for arms warriors with the starting ability letting you split the sword into two for 10 seconds and dual wield. Then another ability later could let you split into two and attack the same target for 15 seconds. Maybe another ability could have been to channel King Varian's spirit or Lo'gosh to empower you. Yet we just leave the swords on the island. While it looks like they're now depleted, isn't the whole point to the artifacts to unlock their full power? Arms warriors could have gotten a whole quest chain to try to restore the power of Shalamayne. And yet they get some no name sword instead. Shalamayne can't be buried in Varian's sarcophagus because it looks like no one went back to retrieve it. So Blizzard royally screwed the pooch on that one. Guess they didn't want to give away Varian died (as obvious as it was) ... although they gave away Tirion dies by giving us Ashbringer or Thrall throwing in the towel because we got Doomhammer. &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
I'm disappointed to say the least. While a lot of my disappointment is my own imagination running wild before we officially got anything and then it getting dashed with what we did get, some of it just feels like missed opportunity after missed opportunity. Others feel like Blizzard just trying to pigeon hole in reasons for the Horde and Alliance to fight. The conflicts often don't feel natural and just feel forced. They often feel like children bickering and they don't want to call in the adults because the adults would see reason and force the children to sit in the corner for a time out.<br />

<br />
There is an undead in the crowd with 'fel' green eyes (@2:03). Since when do they/we have that? Warlock? Dread lord? Something new?<br />
<br />
Also when did Sylvanas grow vampire fangs, as in only long sharp fangs in the upper jaw - others like Vol'jin and other trolls and the orcs tend to have fangs/tusks but usually both in the upper and lower jaw, Sylvanas clearly got herself a pair of vampire fangs. Also the red eyes. Is she turning from Banshee to Vampire? The Vampire Queen? Has she been sneaking off to ICC to drink blood with the the blood council? <br />
<br />
We didn't get to see her sit on the throne, that was sad. I guess there is time for that. So will she be both in Orgrimmar and Undercity now or how will that work? Perhaps the throne just didn't have enough enough skulls for her taste.<br />
<br />
Was that the Felreaver 2.0 from TBC that Wrynn jumped onto?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean it's obvious she didn't &quot;want&quot; to leave Varian/etc to die, however it's not like she tried to stop it, she could have had her forces retreat TOO them so they could all escape together, she could have ordered some to go and warn them to retreat early, etc. I'm glad it was her incompetence that got Varian killed not a deliberate betrayal but still a friggin ranger general should know how to retreat without getting all your allies killed lol.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. I think they did a fairly good job of showing the horde in a dire situation, though I feel it focused too much on the leaders being wounded - it could have shown a bit more pressure than pain IMO. All in all, both were fantastically well done, and that fel reaver thing was terrifying. <br />
<br />
I think they did a good job internalizing Sylvannas' position after Vol'Jin, and added a fair bit of depth in her silent reflection. She can't just worry about the forsaken anymore, and I think that really hit her. Her problems are completely different now. I'll be interested to see how they handle her going forward.</div></div><hr />

I agree on his death not being all that easy;<br />
Just compare our arrival with Varian's arrival at the shore; while we came in on a ship he litteraly fell from the sky and had to swim ashore fully armored.<br />
<br />
And to be honest; the whole point of this event is to give us a sense of urgency and danger approaching; which in turn gives reason for us looking for alternative means of additional power (artifacts).</div></div><hr />

Not to mention that regardless of either Broken Shore cinematic you watch, it does not portray the Horde in a positive light whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Heck, I can understand needing to retreat when you are getting overrun, but the Horde made no serious attempt at warning the Alliance that they can't keep fighting because of them getting surrounded by the minute. This entire event simply justifies the Alliance to resent the Horde because the other faction is not even bothering creating simple communications that will prevent another war.</div></div><hr />

Edit. for the most part its just the case of bad comunication. they could easily establish that horn as what it was as &quot;we are over run we must retreat&quot; but aliance didnt know that which they should and probably would understand<br />
<br />
Clearly, they did, as they reacted to it. It's instinct for them Stormwind kids, they hear the war horn, shit about to happen. Just like Bolvar at the Wrathgate, Horn goes off... Alliance is saved by Dranosh Saurfang. Flags and horns, movement and strategy. You'd think Alliance would've picked up on some horde tactics over the decades.<br />
<br />
I would honestly lay some communication blame to Sylvanas, she is easily the most seasoned of commanders in this coalition, so that sort of thing should have been communicated better - but we never saw any tactical HQ planning session between the leaders. <br />

Talk to your friends for support. Maybe, just maybe, if they play Horde, you can be cool again.<br />
I kno they are dead. Although I believe that Arthas's name is still relevant as there is possibility of im being Anduin's father. There is still chance for Anduin to become something more. And yes, I dislike the boy as he is now, I hoped that Garrosh would finish him off, but that did not happen. And Sylvanas?

I have a small suspicion that Varian didn't actually die when he was pumped full of Fel energy. That scene seemed like a good setup for a twist ending by making him an avatar of Sargeras or something, or a twisted thing like Kael was in Magisters Terrace. So if Varian shows up as a raid boss I would not be surprised. I also note now that the Horde is lead by a woman, who needs to &quot;step out into the light&quot; and other such heavy burden support implications, while the Alliance is lead by a young man of faith, who wants to believe the best in everyone... and Blizzard does so love their bad girl/good boy pairing.<br />
<br />
I don't think its as bad as Horde are making out, the videos show the development of a gross misunderstanding due to lack of communication. They really need to use those communication orb things between the two fronts so that the Horde falling back because they were about to be overrun could have been conveyed to the Alliance and even if Varian had pulled off his sacrifice, it would have been done in the knowledge that the Horde hadn't 'betrayed' them. I don't think the Horde were cowards here, but I do think it was a bit of a hamfisted way to keep up inter-faction conflict when it could have been avoided. Maybe it will be cleared up. Side note, Jainia will flip her shit even further, and Gul'dan was such an evil badass.</div></div><hr />

It wouldnt make sense for the alliance to see more, that's the entire point of it:<br />
The alliance didn't know what was up on horde side and thought the horde betrayed them on purpose</div></div><hr />

<br />
On another note, quite interesting that they're ramping up the tension between horde and alliance again (no doubt this is gonna do so), which I like. It's named WARcraft for a reason imo.<br />
I also dont find the reason all that cheesy. Getting outnumbered and falling back is normal in war. Kinda happy with legion writing so far.</div></div><hr />

They held the high ground with a cast of heroes that were, tactically speaking, ostensibly much stronger than anything the alliance was fielding, and were getting completely wrecked by the lesser portion of Gul'dan's forces. Not impressed.<br />
<br />
Varian definitely had an awesome few moments there, though, and kudos to whoever did Gul'dan's facial expressions. Those were masterful, and only got better as the cinematic concluded. The expression on his face while he drove the fel energy into Varian's gut at the end was just fantastic, like I don't even know how to describe it.</div></div><hr />

Garrosh would wipe the floor with the Legion and wear Gul'dan spikes on his shoulders.<br />
<br />
Well he obviously wouldn't have. His army wasn't enough to defend against the rest of the horde, let alone the entire legion.<br />

It's probably because the alliance was the main focus of the other cinematic. Even the Horde side cinematic is 70% alliance.</div></div><hr />

what? he defended himself against both horde and alliance. with him being present during attack on the legion things would go differently, that is if the traitors of the horde obeyed.</div></div><hr />
