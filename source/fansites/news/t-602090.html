The Inquirer (http://theinquirer.net/?article=42255) published the codename of one of the game currently developed by Blizzard : Hydra. <br />
This is pretty much everything we know and it's actually 3 months old because Blizzplanet (http://www.blizzplanet.com) posted this information along with the codename of Starcraft 2 (Medusa) a few months ago, but quickly edited it out for some unknown reasons. <br />
<br />
Draeneis and Blood Elves PvP Mounts<br />
Wrocas, a german community representative confirmed that Draenei and Blood Elves PvP mounts were planned. (This could be released in the next patch, or in 2.3, the models have been here for ever actually, and I can even use the same picture as 3 months ago !)<br />
As far as I know it is planned to introduce PvP mounts for Draeneis and Blood Elves. However we don't know exactly when this will be implemented.<br />

<br />
Lurky for US customers<br />
Someone asked if it would be possible to get Lurky (a white murloc pet given to European players who bought the CE of Burning Crusade but couldn't get their netherwhelp pet before a few weeks because of a problem. Short answer : no.<br />
Some of the non-combat mini-pets we put into the game are fairly unique and we like to keep them that way. There are actually several of these pets that are unique to their respective region like China, Europe, or Korea. If we repeatedly gave them out to the same region or gave them to all regions just because they exist, they would lose their value for the players who already have one. <br />
<br />
Weâ€™ve given out several types of these pets in the past, some are easy to get while others are quite rare, and we plan to continue making new ones available to players.<br />
<br />
Beams and LOS Mechanics<br />
Drysc explains why beam spells (warlock life drain and mana drain in this case) still works out of LOS and a bit out of range.<br />
Yes, that's how they're supposed to work. <br />
<br />
Generally when attacking you want to be at maximum range, that allows plenty of time between you and the target to get out as many casts as possible. Now for a straight up cast and fly spell, it's cast, it's on it's way, and that's it, it's going to hit. For the channeled spells (I had actually never heard them called &quot;rays&quot; before today, we call the effect a &quot;beam&quot; usually) you cast, and you hold, and that damage can be interrupted or broken. To allow some sort of leeway, some give so that at max range it isn't just instantly wasted all of the time (which would happen, a lot, especially in PvE) it's given a little extra room to grow and follow.<br />
<br />
Monstrous Kaliri going into Evade mode<br />
It seems that Kaliris from Skettis (the big birds aggroing and dismounting you everytime you try to go here) won't be as annoying as now once the 2.2 patch is released. It seems that Blizzard managed to fix the bug switching them to Evade mode everytime you try to do something. <br />
Q: Anyone else think the borderline invincible Kaliris are a little OP?<br />
A: Stop blowing up their eggs. It's rude. (fixed in 2.2)<br />

Pet loyalty mechanics<br />
Mania's Arcania (http://www.maniasarcania.com/2007/09/10/loyalty-gain-time-and-experience/) posted an article about pet loyalty for hunters and how it works. Basically it's a combination of XP gain and time to wait, and if you're looking more information you can read the article on their site (http://www.maniasarcania.com/2007/09/10/loyalty-gain-time-and-experience/)<br />

Nope, it's The Lost Vikings: Hydra, 15 years of development.<br />

Do you by any chance happen to remember where or how exactly you got to that news? I searched my ass off... and needles to say am extremely curious.<br />
And if it's 3 months old then we shouldn't expect it before the 3rd wow expansion. Small chance for the same date, but by far better chance for a later one.<br />
Speculation on what might Blizz offer are welcome. I love everything about strategies, warcraft lore and being able to more or less change it in wow.</div></div><hr />

It's a nice read, make sure you read carefuly though.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Haha just read on the same page that one of the speculated raids when supposebly fighting Sargeras... you fight his SPIRIT, lmao, at the tomb of Sargeras, where his body lies and he can't get in to get it... you fight his spirit... Some strong minds in this site. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or rather, doesn't progress. Outside of quest lines, there is almost no lore progression. This has been a huge caveat in WoW for me. I always wondering what Metzen's opinion on it was.</div></div><hr />

I am so happy that I hit exalted with Eredar before Burning Crusade (with patch 2.0 you could get a lot of reputation in alterac valley) and not every one is riding around with the cool elekk :)</div></div><hr />

only warlocks can hit exalted with the eredar<br />
<br />
@gorn - quartermasters, and you can do the low lvl quests on the islands. The ones that are non-draenei will give the same rep as they'd give to a low lvl draenei starting in the zone.</div></div><hr />

There was a link on one of the sites I was on with the latest in gaming news for the week (this was only a short while ago, post Blizzcon I think) that said &quot;Warcraft IV in the works&quot;<br />
<br />
It was like a Q&amp;A with Metzen about how when Starcraft 2 was finished they wanted to begin work on Warcraft IV because he didn't like the way the lore progressed in an MMO environment or something of the sort.<br />
<br />
Its been about a month I'll go looking around and see if I can dig it up (sadly I cleared all my cache, cookies, and history last week dammit &gt;&lt;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronnosh</div><div class="date">2007-09-12, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was like a Q&amp;A with Metzen about how when Starcraft 2 was finished they wanted to begin work on Warcraft IV because he didn't like the way the lore progressed in an MMO environment or something of the sort.<br />
<br />
Lore seems very difficult to progress when timelines of events pretty much reset upon themselves in an MMO environment and the unfolding of the next chapter/Expansion is contingent upon events of the current chapter. Sometimes, the current events present an incongruity with the direction that the creative team wants to take the game next and the only solution available to advance the the larger story would be to retcon/remove/recreate portions of the world itself to reflect a sense of real time and the effects of past in-game events and occurences on the world and its inhabitants(i,e., the Naxx redux coming in WotLK, the floating city of Dalaran). <br />
<br />
This is a difficult decision to make, as unlike in RTS games where players take a 3rd person perception and watch the world unfold from the view of an outsider, an MMO immerses the player in the world itself and provides a more intimate view of and interaction with the heroes and villains. Players grow attached to specific characters that become necessary sacrifices to the greater good of lore advancement, and the ensuing sentiments are seldom ever pleasant. Furthermore, as evident by player reactions to the impact of both patches and X-Pacs, some people just aren't happy with change in general and prefer things to remain the way they are to retain their personal enjoyment at the expense of other players' experiences and an environmental stagnation. These are problems the creative team doesn't have to face when advancing a story through an RTS or any other linear progressed game.<br />
<br />
If anything, I think the Eredar/Draenei retcon and its ensuing backlash is still nagging at Metzen.</div></div><hr />
