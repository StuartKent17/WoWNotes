Later today, we will take the WoW Classic closed beta down for maintenance and we will increase the level cap from 30 to 40. This will allow testers to level up in zones such as Stranglethorn Vale, Desolace, and Arathi Highlands (among others).<br />
<br />
To further assist testing efforts, we will reduce the cost to respec closed beta characters. The new cost will be charged in silver instead of gold, a 99% reduction in cost, and will only be applied to the beta test.<br />
<br />
We’re also going to open Arathi Basin for limited testing in the closed beta. There will be no templates, so all characters will need to be level 20 or higher to participate. The test will begin on the afternoon of Thursday, June 6.<br />

Don't expect an invite. You and your guildies aren't the only ones wanting in, if they invited everyone who wants to be in, the servers wouldn't be stable. Just be patient for 2 months, and enjoy the content the streamers are providing, and if you don't like streamers then just wait 2 months.</div></div><hr />

That is a silly thing to say. I'd like to know how far the beta is progressing. Its both interesting and good to know what aspects are being examined. You don't have to be invited to beta for it to be relevant. Plus it keeps the Classic community in continued anticipation and excitement :)<br />

It's only a bad thing if one gets irrationally upset because you weren't chosen to be a tester.<br />

Majority who plays beta is not streamers, by far. Out of 3000 people in the beta, maybe 100 is streaming, I would bet less. It's the exposure what people see but not the other folks who just play and report.</div></div><hr />

I watched it as well and got some kicks out of it while doing random stuff around the house. That tauren warrior that was always running on top of the duelists was a pain in the ass though. Hope he got banned for griefing.<br />
<br />
I hope I don't get into the beta, I would be tempted to play and waste my already limited time on something that will be deleted in 2 months. I'll stick with random retail play and some MTG Arena in the meantime!</div></div><hr />

I've been dabbling a bit, but hate the class I chose waste my level boost on this xpac, also I let a friend talk me into swapping to Alliance also so I have a server with all my horde characters just sitting at lvl 100-110 just don't want to level through the shit BFA quest zones again. So I am stuck with a Monk I am not really into on the Faction I don't like to play and just have nothing that interests me ATM, Ill probably end up un subbing again until Classic.</div></div><hr />

I'm in the beta and I'm not a streamer. I thought I would get burnout too but oh man at this point I don't even think it's possible. I've seriously been leveling multiple characters, even some of the same class, and I have yet to feel any amount of burnout yet.<br />

I'm sorry for putting salt in the wound about you not getting a beta invite, but trust me when I say it's 100% going to be worth the wait when you do finally get to sit down and play it. I'm excited for when Classic finally comes out and you all get to come join in on the fun.</div></div><hr />

it will be equaly boring when its live. And chars will basically be wiped there aswell. There is no future in classic. When the final raid timegate is opened, then thats that, game over</div></div><hr />

<br />
They then did a small invite of people who opted in... with very particular criteria.<br />
<br />
Then a rather large invite pool of stress testers<br />
<br />
Rumor was a F&amp;F list was invited now.<br />
<br />
This is progress.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like they:<br />
<br />
Got their media support in place<br />
Got some hardcore vanilla players in to test accuracy.<br />
Got the servers stress tested for multiple logins using layering.<br />
<br />
In other words, up til now it's been a technical beta and NOW are inviting people to more completely test the content.<br />
<br />
They naturally started with F&amp;F and perhaps the next wave is for the common WoW player.</div></div><hr />

The temptation to try it all out now is going to be too much, and it's quite likely that it will kill the hype to some degree. <br />
Streamers may lose some of the excitement that they would have had for live release. <br />
I'd like to see a totally different set of people chosen for the new level cap and if they change cap again later, again new people getting access, the others not <br />
So far it's been the world of streamcraft. We can see why blizzard gave beta to streamers but we feel it's unfair too.</div></div><hr />

I will say that its too easy currently but thats mainly because we're at 120 levels. If they want to make the leveling experience harder we're going to need a level squish and change the way we do things when new expansions drop as the leveling system isnt the best way in the long run. But the quest's after cata revamp, the quests flow, the story, etc are waaaayyyyyyyy better than classics lol</div></div><hr />

How does number of levels affect leveling? Its just a number. If it was 60 levels instead of 120, but each level required double amount of XP, it would be exactly the same.<br />
<br />
As for quest quality, its a matter of opinion. For you Cataclysm quest system is better, for me its worse. I don't like handholding, I don't like when my character is some kind of saviour (this is a multi-player game, not single player, so whole premise of being hero doesn't make sense), I don't like when quests are streamlined into oblivion so each quest is same as previous one, zone-wide stories and quest lines feel disconnected from the rest of world. I prefer when quests span multiple zones, when I'm just another adventurer, one of many adventurers, when mobs can fight back, when quest objective is not near quest giver and requires some thinking. New quest types are basically same old collect/kill X, but with different UI, though it is nice to have variation in UI.<br />
<br />
That's why BfA and Classic will co-exist - for players who prefer post-WoTLK WoW there is BfA, for players who prefer old WoW there will be Classic. Different games for different players.</div></div><hr />

The old quest system barely needed you to think. You just needed to read and most people just looked at thottbot back then. at this point you already know what to do. ill give you the spanning zone thing but come on the story in zones are awesome. Ferelas story is one of my favorite parts of the revamp.<br />
<br />
Also the issue with the levels is that imagine if you had classic leveling speed with 120 levels but exponentially increasing in time. So it would actually take longer to reach 120 than it did from 1-60. That will be fun maybe one time and thats it. I couldnt stand the slowness grinding to 60...shit was so boring after a while and one of the only times i needed a break because more quests were the same. New quests are atleast engaing in a narrative. And you're not some hero at lvl 1 lol that happened after WoTLK because hello we are in every major battle. of course we continue to get stronger and more recognized, it actually makes sense when you think about it</div></div><hr />

I’m with you on this one. I’ve got the level 30 and did all that Jazz, but I’m not no-lifing it for the beta. I really enjoyed it, but that grind is not for wasting days of played. Yes, we’re there to test, and I am, but I’m not grinding out the level 40 meta.</div></div><hr />

its rng, but its also different this beta then others. Blueposter confirmed they are looking at others things they don't look at in retail beta's. Like the age of your account. And that was my main point of the previous post<br />

Mh.. Like every beta before? Influencers got first access to expansion betas as well in order to increase exposure. *shrug*<br />
<br />
It's not a bad idea tbh. I got beta access as well three weeks ago and didn't get over lvl 15 yet because I don't gave the time for it. Especially with an obvious character wipe at the end. Streamers do, because they earn their living with it.</div></div><hr />

And chars will basically be wiped there aswell. There is no future in classic. When the final raid timegate is opened, then thats that, game over<br />
<br />
Even if they decide to go the OSRS route of adding new content (voted by community) post naxx instead of TBC (alternate reality servers, why not? we already have time travel..)<br />
<br />
personally, if they continue to add content post naxx i don't see myself ever touching live again without something major like a Necromancer class added</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet people complain over and over that it's still tedious and it needs nerfs.people that want to rush to 12 and couldn't care any less about 1-119 content. The forums are flooded with these complaints constantly.<br />
<br />
The player ase is divided. Blizzard can't currently catter to both sides. Perhaphs Clasic will help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not a streamer... nor am I in BETA. You do not speak for me. It is not unfair for streamers to have access. I am very thankful that they do as they provide me with a WIDE variety of viewpoints, tactics, classes, and just plain entertainment.<br />
<br />
Streamer invites do not, in any way, affect my eligibility for beta or the number of available beta slots Blizzard chooses to make available.<br />
<br />
As far as inviting a different set of people fo the 40 cap... it take a significant amount of time to go from 30-40.. more than it takes to go from 1-30. And then even more from 40-50 and 50-60. Unless they made premades at level 30... leveling up a toon from 1-40 would likely take too long to provide significant data.<br />
<br />
<br />
The question lies in whether they feel comfortable that the leveling process and quests were adequately tested with the current players... and if they want a second round of 1-30 testing. If they are confident it's &quot;good to go&quot;... there is no reason to add new people at all... the existing beta testers and streamers can move from 30-40 and provide feedback on that leveling content.<br />
<br />
I hope they add more people... but I could easily see that since this is simply restoring content already well tested years ago... that they only need test that the restored data is working.. not if the content itself needs &quot;fixed&quot;.<br />
<br />
The have stated on at least a couple occasions that this is a &quot;very limited beta&quot;.</div></div><hr />

The thing is, wow classic was probably not given any marketing budget. Blizz allows it, but may not be pushing it too hard ahead of BFA.<br />
<br />
WoW classic is using streamers as a source of free advertisement, and it's still wave 1 of beta so we have june, and july to go for those who want in. It isn't that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
If you ran wow classic and needed free advertising, but had no budget at all for it... how else do it than by getting streamers in? You are grateful, but others need to relax and just be grateful that there's this much interest in wow classic and that it has converted nearly all the big youtube wow players who were &quot;no classic, only bfa&quot; crowd.<br />
<br />
Even preach who said he had 0 interest in it is DEEEEEEEP into classic now</div></div><hr />
