As previously discussed ( http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2065568025 (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157908/incoming-hotfixes) ) we're currently planning to put out a couple hotfixes specifically for Arcane mages. Likely today.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Arcane Blast (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/30451/arcane-blast/) base mana cost from 7% to 5%.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, with the above change in mind we are also going to nerf the Shard of Woe (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/60233/shard-of-woe/) trinket to halve the mana savings for Arcane spells only. It's still a fantastic trinket for Arcane mages even with the reduction. <br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 4.0.6 Hotfixes - February 14<br />
February 14<br />
General<br />
<br />
Players who are exalted with 40 factions are again awarded The Exalted title. Note that the associated achievement does not state that this title will be awarded when it's earned. This will be corrected in a future patch. More information can be found here.<br />

<br />
Starfall (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48505/starfall/) will now hit any target in range which is in combat or not at full health (including the Exposed Head of Magmaw, which was causing issues with Starfall).<br />

The hotfix to Beacon of Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53563/beacon-of-light/) and Light of Dawn (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/85222/light-of-dawn/) on February 11 did not produce the intended results and has been reverted. Light of Dawn should still trigger Beacon of Light.<br />

<br />
The Atramedes achievement Silence is Golden (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5308/silence-is-golden/) was incorrectly failing when any raid member's sound bar went over 30%. The achievement now requires no one's sound bar to go over 50% as advertised.<br />

Whiptail respawn rates way too high?<br />
We're aware of this and taking a look at the respawn rates. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/158192/whiptail-respawn-rate))<br />
<br />
Twilight Jasmine spawn rate<br />
There was no nerf after release, but there (I believe) was an issue with herbs being in different phases than you so thus the sparseness. I also believe that this was corrected. But, I can definitely ask about Twilight Jasmine. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/158192/whiptail-respawn-rate))<br />

Warlock damage &quot;changes&quot; in 4.0.6<br />
We're aware of the concerns that the damage of Immolate and Corruption may have gone down unintentionally as part of 4.0.6 or a bug fix shortly thereafter. This was not an intentional change and so far we’ve been unable to determine if such a change occurred or what could have caused it. We have, for example, looked at several Destruction warlocks whose DoT damage went up, which would be the expected outcome of the Improved Soul Fire talent. If you have additional new information, especially if it's empirical and reproducible, please share it with us as we continue to investigate.

Fury in 4.0.6<br />
After 4.0.6 went in, Fury was doing more damage than projected, and higher dps than we wanted for the spec. Essentially, the 4.0.6 changes for Fury weren't intended to be a damage buff to begin with - we just wanted to make the mastery more appealing and de-emphasize Heroic Strike. Instead, we saw Fury damage jump up more than could be accounted for from factors like the metagem change. It also seems that Raging Blow had become very strong after the mastery change. So, we made the decision to reduce Fury damage, and Raging Blow became a good place to make that adjustment, since that allowed us to address both the PvE damage issues and the PvP burst concerns at the same time.<br />
<br />
We think the verdict is still out over whether Single-Minded Fury has become a clear choice over Titan's Grip. All the evidence available right now is theory crafted, but we still want to see how performance shakes out in actual play. If the theory crafting turns out to be correct, then we'll consider adjusting Single-Minded Fury then, probably a reduction. In the meantime, it's probably best to stick with whichever play style you find the most fun, or at least, have the most appropriate weapons for. It's good to keep in mind that there are more two-handed weapons with strength on them than there are strength heavy one-handed weapons, though there's also probably more competition for those two-handers as well.<br />
<br />
No offense... but how did you not account for this?<br />
No offense taken. World of Warcraft is a complex game, and due to all the factors involved, predicting performance changes over the whole playing population and in every feasible scenario can be challenging. We run the numbers to predict dps under several different conditions and then compare those estimates to empirical data (generated in house and collected from live games). Most of the time, that data gives us a pretty accurate picture. Still, there are a lot of Fury warriors out there with various mixes of gear, talent specs and skill levels, and despite the projections, damage went up for a lot of those players more than we expected. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/158242/blizzard-a-humble-and-pleading-request))<br />
<br />
Fury AoE<br />
Some of you have expressed some concerns regarding Fury AoE, so this is a good time to mention that we're looking at area of effect damage for a lot of specs, Fury included. So, it's on the radar. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/158242/blizzard-a-humble-and-pleading-request))<br />
<br />
Warrior DPS<br />
We feel that warrior dps is about where it should be, and that the class continues to bring valuable output to a raid and will scale well in the future as well. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/158242/blizzard-a-humble-and-pleading-request))<br />
<br />
SMF vs. Titan's Grip<br />
Single-Minded Fury and Titan's Grip were really close in the wake of 4.0.6, which was a good place. Now it's possible that SMF is doing better than TG by a wider margin than we're comfortable with. We don't want to eliminate choices and see a rush on SMF, and we'd rather see players choosing the weapons they'd prefer. If that means bringing SMF back into line with TG, then that might be the course of action we take. Nothing is necessarily guaranteed or imminent though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/158242/blizzard-a-humble-and-pleading-request))<br />
<br />
Class balance / PTR Testing and Fury Nerf<br />
A lot of players on the PTR correctly predicted the problem, yes. But players always predict problems, many of which never materialize. The feedback from the PTRs is valuable, but we don't expect it to result in a perfect assessment, and we've learned that we can’t and shouldn’t just accept everything at face value. Players that post concisely, objectively and provide a lot of verifiable evidence of their claims tend to provide the most valuable information, and the kind of feedback that we're far more likely to heed. When concerns are raised, we discuss them and run tests of our own, and decide whether a change is warranted or not.<br />
<br />
In this case, we were aware of the concerns being raised about Raging Blow burst damage in PvP. We agreed with the arguments that it required a lot of cooldowns and stacked mastery to get going, and even then enrage could easily be removed by several classes. We didn't believe that this would lead to Fury dominating PvP, and we didn't change it at the time because we didn’t want to nerf Fury’s PvE damage over a (possibly overstated) PvP concern. We also didn't want to risk making mastery a poor stat again, which was the most significant issue we were trying to fix. When Fury’s PvE dps proved higher than our target, then Raging Blow was the obvious candidate to decrease since a reduction there was likely to solve all the issues that we were hoping to address.

Which is why I let my sub end 2 weeks ago. I'm checking back in a few months when the current beta testing is over and the dust may have settled. I don't enjoy relearning my class every week lol.<br />

I take it you've never actually done any programming on larger pieces of software?<br />
<br />
Especially when said thing requires delegation into groups; every programmer is only familiar with perhaps 5% of the code. The rest of what they know is &quot;I receive this (from someone elses code) - i turn it into this in my code and then send it to (some elses code)&quot;</div></div><hr />

Really this is no excuse. Stuff like this is vital to their game, it should be clear as a picture to every coder that is involved with class balancing and beyond. Every spell in the game should be change-able without the change affecting something else unintentionally - thats all I'm saying. The sad part here is, that they don't understand what their change in code might affect and as said, this is not acceptable. <br />
<br />
As you said, they probably have different programmers for different parts, if they all don't see and understand the whole code (kinda wierd), then at least the ones who change stuff like this must be aware of what they are doing, from the past months posts, I'm not sure they really are. And yes, it is borderline to amateurism at least in my and many peoples eyes, who have to do with programming on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
And let's not mention that they must have some QA going on there, and not everyone can spam their piece of code right into it, before someone with the big picture in the head examines it and approves it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cirque</div><div class="date">2011-02-15, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You must keep in mind that compared to say vanilla and TBC, Blizzard is telling us much more what's happening. Before they might never have mentioned the warlock bug that arised as a consequence of whatever hotfix they applied, and they'd have fixed it silently. Nobody would have known for sure, or, for that matter, cared as much as people are in this topic.<br />
<br />
It's a new expansion. There's a lot of new stuff. Balancing will take time, as it did before. And in all honesty, PvP is not THAT broken, especially not when you compare it to how it was at the start of WOTLK (RESILIENCE WILL FIX.... owait). I find them exceedingly slow with glaring issues, though. Arcane mages should have been buffed the week after the release, not only now, and I am unsure if I agree in the way the buff's happening - especially when they then feel the need to complicate matters even further by changing how a trinket works, but only for one certain spec of one certain class. It feels clumsy. Similarly, AoE has been completely out of line. Fire mages, demo locks and frost death knights blowing everything up by just blinking at something, and then they nerf the cleave of warrior, which, I feel, was perfectly fine. And now they say they're going to look at AoE - yet again. I don't mind if one class has very good AoE and another hasn't. I don't mind I'm forced in demo for AoE fights, either. I just mind this indecision of theirs, where they simply seem to have no clue where they want abilities to be, and we're two months after the release! Just.. Make up your mind.<br />
<br />
Similarly, the &quot;balancing&quot; of heroic fights. The Halfus nerf may have been deserved, but the timing was uncalled for. As a 10 man guild, we progressed a week before the nerf with weird setups that Blizzard, I believe, feels to have no place in 10mans, including alts coming (shaman) for the interrupts, 4 healers, or 3 tanks, respeccing in specific AoE, speccing out of it and back to singletarget - it was, to be honest, a lot of fun. Then the nerf happens and we literally one shot it while being half-alttabbed of boredom. Too many guilds already had started progress on a fight. They should not trivialize it so late, they have had tons of time to test and see, or at least to make a statement a few weeks back where &quot;ok, we might nerf this and that boss&quot;. It made the whole fight feel unrewarding, boring, and as a consequence none of us can really be bothered to return to BoT at all (though for obvious reasons, we will anyway).<br />
<br />
In summary, though I could go on and on with more examples, I feel Blizzard has no plan or ideas for the future and how they really want their game to be. They keep changing things haphazardly, things that should have been either left untouched or changed way earlier. Nerfs happen too fast, buffs too slow. It confuses the community and makes the development of the game feel clunky at best.</div></div><hr />

This. It's fine that it is a big game. It's understandable that they have teams working on their own segments of the game. However, the person or team in ultimate charge of the game is supposed to manage, control and direct those groups in such a way as to make the final product coherent and polished. Not feel like we are still in Beta. I'm not a programmer but I DO know how to create a working and responsive system that gets the job done. I've also seen enough fail systems to recognize one in action when I see one.<br />
<br />
Whoever is in charge of WoW at the moment (Ghostcrawler?) is quite simply an incompetent manager. It looks as though each of the individual segment teams are running willy nilly with no managerial control. It makes the game disjointed and feel incomplete.<br />
<br />
I get that there are simply some things that you never know about until you really stress test it, however as the blue post said they take any player tested feedback with a grain of salt. That's fine for &quot;OMG WTF Y YOU NERF ME!!!&quot; commentary but they are also pretty much ignoring the coherent and rational responses as well. Druid and warrior changes are prime examples of that.<br />
<br />
I also do not think this willingness to change things rapidly is necessarily a good thing. I would say it's good when you have a strong hand on the helm, when you have someone capable of prioritizing and filtering it down to the things that must be dealt with immediately. That isn't what we have atm, we have a bunch of monkeys flinging shit at the wall and seeing what sticks, resulting in nothing more than a terrible mess.<br />
<br />
Morhaime needs to start knocking heads in the WoW management team. I'm deeply dissatisfied to the point of wanting to quit and not one of my many WoW friends feel much differently.</div></div><hr />

I will agree that there has been a lot of re-balancing and bug fixes. I don't know whether this is exaggerated by the amount of communication Blizzard is giving us, or if there truly is more problems this expansion. The reason I'm wary to follow the whiners is b/c they either just started playing the game or have a very short memory. DK imbalance at the beginning of WotLK anyone? <br />
<br />
Some would say that by now Blizzard should be able to put out a polished game from the beginning, but I wonder how many of those were the same people complaining about running ICC for a year and begging Blizzard to release Cataclysm in November. In the end, some people will leave for AoC, Aion, Warhammer, Rift, DC Universe Online, etc. After 3 months, some of those people will return to WoW, others will refuse to return and admit defeat. Until possibly TOR, there will not be a company with the manpower, let alone the experience, to fix bugs/imbalance as quickly as Blizzard, as well as continuously release new content. <br />
<br />
I understand that this argument is futile, as most of the people complaining on this forum have already been banned from the official forums and down-voted into blackness on other forums, but I like to add a little reason to the madness.</div></div><hr />

The internals are probably a mess and it was probably inherited that way.  That it hasnt been fixed is a question of developer time, risk and importance. It is simply easier to keep adding spaghetti.</div></div><hr />

For my part I've been playing since February after release. What is that 6 years? Geesh. I've been here for every expac and while there has always been retuning I can't honestly say that I've ever seen such major and fundamental changes to some classes POST expac release. I go back to my key point, it feels like WoW is being managed very poorly. Whoever is responsible for WoW atm needs to be replaced with competent and strong leadership. Important game changes need to be made within an environment of stability or at expansions and I just don't see it happening right now. It's uncharacteristic of Blizzard. But we all know that every company has its ups and downs.<br />
<br />
I do take issue with one thing you are saying. Blizzard is not really &quot;communicating.&quot; They are telling, and telling us they don't know exactly what is going on in their own game should be a major red flag. If the code is getting wild, tame it. They gross BILLIONS off this game, if they don't have the manpower they need to buy it.<br />
<br />
For my part if I do quit I will not be coming back. It is a very, very, very close thing at the moment. The only thing that has stopped me is the love of my friends. But the last month has really soured me on the whole MMO genre, because I do agree with you that no one does it better than Blizz.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this is coming from someone who was pants-wetting excited for Cata. I was stoked and it's safe to say that I am a Blizz fanboy, I've been with them since the first Warcraft game. The only time they ever really lost me was on WC III, and I didn't blame them. It was a quality game, just not what I wanted.</div></div><hr />

Well let me see, a marine biologist who managed to become the lead designer on a RTS (Age of Empires) gets hired to run the worlds biggest MMO.<br />
Greg Street was not hired for his ability to design, he was hired for his ability to be &quot;cost effective&quot; and explore &quot;revenue streams&quot; and how to &quot;monetize&quot; the player base.<br />
If you step back and take a look at Cataclysm you'll notice everything was done to make the development less expensive and easier while at the same time telling the player base it was for them and to make the game &quot;fun and engaging&quot;.<br />
Think back to all the things Mr. Street told the players and which turned out to be the exact opposite(ie: we want heals to be less spammy, we want raid damage to be less spikey, we want to get away from one shot mechanics). Anyone who has spent any time in corporate structure recognizes what is going on, repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth.</div></div><hr />

I do agree that the communication lately has been them admitting that they can't seem to get the code to work they way they want it to. That and the fact that they're just changing things like The Exalted title on a whim concerns me. They do revert changes that turn out to be [U]major[U] mistakes however.

I don't know whether this is exaggerated by the amount of communication Blizzard is giving us, or if there truly is more problems this expansion. The reason I'm wary to follow the whiners is b/c they either just started playing the game or have a very short memory. DK imbalance at the beginning of WotLK anyone? <br />
<br />
Some would say that by now Blizzard should be able to put out a polished game from the beginning, but I wonder how many of those were the same people complaining about running ICC for a year and begging Blizzard to release Cataclysm in November. In the end, some people will leave for AoC, Aion, Warhammer, Rift, DC Universe Online, etc. After 3 months, some of those people will return to WoW, others will refuse to return and admit defeat. Until possibly TOR, there will not be a company with the manpower, let alone the experience, to fix bugs/imbalance as quickly as Blizzard, as well as continuously release new content. <br />
<br />
I understand that this argument is futile, as most of the people complaining on this forum have already been banned from the official forums and down-voted into blackness on other forums, but I like to add a little reason to the madness.<br />
<br />
<br />
You forget that there are those of us posting here that simply refuse to use the official forums. Why? Because we realized nothing we say matters. If I'm going to spend my personal time discussing an mmo then I'm going to do it somewhere that I can at least have some half decent conversation. For all of the trolls, idiots, and asshats on mmochampion there are several people here that are intelligent. <br />
<br />
I plan on leaving WoW for ToR. That doesn't mean I want WoW to be shit though. The feeling I get from reading blizz comments is that the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. They seem to have a dev team for each class, and they don't seem to know what any other dev team is doing. It leads to some classes being massively OP, while others get nerfed to the ground. Then you have a lead dev that seems completely out of touch with the game he is supposed to be working on. It really doesn't inspire much confidence. Especially when they admit they were warned about many of the things occurring. Yet their official response was to ignore it while the fanboys bashed anyone complaining. Now here we are having to get stuff hotfixed that they were told was going to happen. Why should I even bother any more with the PTR when I'm just going to be ignored.<br />
<br />
What really pisses me off is this comment <br />
<br />
<br />
A lot of players on the PTR correctly predicted the problem, yes. But players always predict problems, many of which never materialize. The feedback from the PTRs is valuable, but we don't expect it to result in a perfect assessment, and we've learned that we can’t and shouldn’t just accept everything at face value. Players that post concisely, objectively and provide a lot of verifiable evidence of their claims tend to provide the most valuable information, and the kind of feedback that we're far more likely to heed. When concerns are raised, we discuss them and run tests of our own, and decide whether a change is warranted or not.<br />
<br />
First the math was done on all the warrior stuff, and it was shown that most of the changes would have a HUGE impact. Much higher than they stated. This was shown to blizz, but they ignored it. I just don't understand. The information is posted just as they ask, they say they discuss and test. Yet if that was the case we wouldn't be having these hotfixes.</div></div><hr />

They utterly gutted Feral PvP (root break removal on Shapeshifting!) and at the same time they gave DKs root, stun break &amp; immunity along with partial snare &quot;limiter&quot;.<br />
<br />
Rather fine logic by Blizz standards / facepalm (that means &quot;legendary&quot; facepalm)<br />

They also said they want to remove hard counters from the game, yet root break removal on Shapeshifting made 3 other classes &quot;hard counter&quot; to Feral. <br />

Shapeshifting change was not announced in advance and and there were no real discussion about it. Actually &quot;blues and Blizz devs&quot; are actually avoiding and ignoring everything from druid community.<br />

Arcane buff and item change functionally change JUST for 1 spec is exactly a thing NOT TO DO! Exceptions like this need to be avoided at all cost! Yet WoW is so full of those kind of exceptions that it is becoming just silly. Exceptions like this are making PvP not only hard to balance but just impossible, as every class have special exceptions that are built upon.<br />
<br />
I really do not understand this sort of mentality for Blizz devs, that they just need to fix things that are not broken into a broken state (either OP, UP or just in literal sense of being useless)</div></div><hr />

I was very angry at first with the feral changes, but that is not what is ultimately leading to my thoughts of leaving WoW. It's more like the dingleberry on top of a shit sundae. I'd been troubled and generally bored pretty quick after hitting lvl 85, but I couldn't really put my finger on what was bothering me. This entire patch . . . the way it's been handled; the gutting of rated BGs from the initial concept many of us cheered for; yet another matchmaking system in rateds that fails utterly; Tol Barad . . . they add up to a development team that is clueless. <br />
<br />
Blizz has had plenty of boneheaded moves but something about this latest batch has just hit me all wrong. Maybe I'm getting old, but I do think something has fundamentally changed in WoW, and it wasn't for the better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvP and PvE need to be split completely. Let players copy their chars into PVP chars where their spells behave like they want them to behave in PvP, while leaving normal PvE characters they way they should be. Just a char copy like for the test realm. World PvP is dead anyway, so noone cares if you get jumped while questing by some who have op PvE talents, but as soon as you enter an arena, bg, or any other rated stuff you spawn on your PvP character copy and stuff starts to behave differently. <br />
<br />
That way they can balance the game for PvE and PvP without having to constantly balance those two world against each other. For example, I'd like my Mana Burn to be viable like it was on Moam one day, where you could actually drain something in PvE, and when I would join PvP it would be just as shit as it is now.<br />
<br />
I expected them to do something like that a long time ago, maybe even double .exes WoWPvE.exe and WoWPvP.exe, what do I know, all I know is that the balancing PvP vs. PvE and the other way around is slowly but surely destroying the fun of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Name one arcane based heal.<br />
<br />
The only classes it affects are Arcane Mages, and Moonkins (and I don't think Moonkins were even interested in this trinket but I could be wrong). And coupled with the recent AB mana buff, it actually yields a higher mana save than it did previously.</div></div><hr />
