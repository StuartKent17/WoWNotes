<br />
2. Why mentioning 2% wipe? If i need to count how many times a realm/world first has been depending on close-to-down there would be no point. Not that i care that much, but i know alot will take the 2% as a exuse of them trying too look best again. Just leave them be, they still did a good job being EU first. ;D<br />

Again gz!<br />

<br />
Agreed 100%. <br />
<br />
A 2% wipe is still a wipe, and no one cares how close you were to almost getting a world 2nd.<br />
<br />
Gratz to Ensidia, but this is not front page news worthy. If people want to know Ensidia updates they can go to Ensidia's website. <br />
<br />
Edit: I understand that it's a EU first, but it's a world 3rd at this point. Front page news should be world firsts and nothing else -- the rest can be posted on the forums by anyone willing to share the news.</div></div><hr />

Jesus christ.<br />
They didnt use it as an excuse.<br />
They didnt blame anything or anyone.<br />
Its still a region first.<br />
The 2% screen is just to clarify what prevented em from getting it last week, so people wont come up with shitty paranoid stories about what did take place.</div></div><hr />

At least try to get your facts straightened out. We have never, anywhere, named lag as a reason for not getting a world first. It's simply been an issue we've had to deal with for a very long time (even during Ulduar we had to take 2h+ breaks due to our server being unplayable). Also if you're one of those retards that are going to bring up C'thun, Vashj, Twins, Freya, Mimiron and so on as example of us exploiting you might as well just start reading up on the New World Order conspiracy theories as well.<br />
<br />
Also, in before the &quot;Ensidia said it was mathematically impossible&quot; idiots.</div></div><hr />

Would you like me to go back and post on the Algalon thread to make you happy? Imo anything after World Firsts are watered down achievements and aren't front page worthy. EU and US firsts are in the same boat, so I could care less if this was Ensidia or not -- in fact the US 2nd post is just as dumb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am a bit confused why the 2% pic or even mention. I don't follow ensidia (or any guilds) website and I don't really care if they wiped at 2% last week. It almost looks like mmo champ is trying to say they should have done it faster but they wiped at 2% so lets all hold hands for them. I dunno nothing against them or mmo champ but it seems strange. <br />
<br />
I don't think ensidia needs an ego boost. They know they are one of the best guilds in the world.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teahi</div><div class="date">2009-09-24, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, wtf has happened with people on this site. Seriously, get your god damn head cleared and stop this pathetic Ensidia flaming. In the last months have you seen any official (or even unofficial) thread/post from any Ensidia member boasting about have good they are or that other people suck ass or in any way beeing offensive/rude? Have they done anything else than congratulating other guilds on their world 1st?<br />
If you didn't know anything about them and had the last 6 months of thread-records to view you would (if you are not completely brainless) come to the conclusion that this was a guild with aloth of skilled players and, just like 90% of the rest of the HC guilds, seem like a nice bunch of players. Ah they changed server.. well maybe it did lag like a fucker, i dont know, but who cares?<br />
<br />
Second, If this was any other EU guild you would go: &quot;Ah cool grats mates! Awesome job on EU 1st/World 3rd!!&quot;. Yes you would. Now sit down.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Agree 100%<br />
<br />
Does this site sponsor Ensidia or something? They didn't get world first, so screw giving them a news post.<br />
<br />
Awesome, congrats on being a complete dick. Logic and reason's not your thing eh?<br />
<br />
And finally, grats Ensidia, well deserved. Keep it up.<br />

By the way, its not just Americans hating Ensidia. They were formed from 2 of the top guilds, they have amazing players, they get paid. They're pretty much the New York Yankees, so people love to see them fail. Most people don't want the top pick to win. They like underdogs.

<br />
perhaps. but a screenshot doesn't say everything. Isn't it possible they got the boss even below 2%, but then due to the lack of dps because of the deaths the boss healed himself up again, and the screenshot was only taken after almost the entire raid had wiped? <br />

However, its not really newsworthy. US or Euro first kill doesn't matter, the first kill regardless of region is the only one that should count. <br />
<br />
Its impressive they did this, god knows how much time they put into this. Personally I wouldn't be able to because I can't take a game that seriously and no this isn't a flame attempt just an observation. Its rather cute though, how the playerbase is split dead on. You have the Ensidia fanboys, who post on their forums and kiss their ass and defend them with no probably reward for doing so and then you have the haters who anytime Ensidia isn't first at doing something they will talk about how badly they suck. It must be hard flaming Ensidia for sucking so bad..while raiding Naxx10.</div></div><hr />

Gotta agree with krematoria here (heh fellow undead rogue :D). I am no fanboy or nothing but where exactly does it say that they blame the boss for wiping at 2% OR that they lost the world first because they wiped at 2%? All it says was that last week they wiped at 2% thats it lol they are just throwing it out there. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bogrim</div><div class="date">2009-09-24, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is newsworthy because Ensidia is a guild that is known for world first kills and people have been curious as to why Europe's best guild didn't make it sooner. The wipe reason was also posted for that exact reason, to explain that they were already close.<br />
<br />
If you‚Äôre suggesting Ensidia doesn‚Äôt deserve to be highlighted when they didn‚Äôt get the first or second kill, realize these news still interest a large amount of the readers and that‚Äôs not necessarily just fans of Ensidia. You have no business telling what news deserves to be posted or not.<br />
<br />
This achievement was different from other world firsts because the approach had to be done much differently, even from Algalon. A guild that is used to learning their raid encounters in a different style doesn‚Äôt have that much of an advantage doing this kind of world first, so it was an opportunity for other guilds to show off some of their skills.<br />
<br />
Does that mean those guilds are better than Ensidia? That America is better than Europe? I don‚Äôt consider those relevant, let alone rational. A guild has different qualities, and different guilds will get different achievements. This has still been a good and fun challenge to all of the top guilds.</div></div><hr />

Granted we also do not get paid to do so...but Ensidia is, and they finally did it. <br />

as far as the 2% it really isn't news. If there were posts each time some one wiped at 2%, that is all that would be on the site. Victory is all that matters, not proximity.</div></div><hr />

PS: grats for EU first.<br />

<br />
haha. I find it hilarious that everyone thinks you got to be a god at the game to be in a guild like Ensidia. All you need to do is be situational sound player while dps/heal/etc. It's really not that hard to do as people make it out to be. To think there is only 25-50 good players in the game is just ignorant. <br />
<br />
The key isn't the player, it's getting 24 other guys like yourself that can do that as well. That's what makes one guild stand out over another. I know tons of crap guilds with 1-2 simply amazing players but theyre technically only as good as their worst raider.</div></div><hr />

Fuck off also to all the fanboys, yes they are a good guild, but that does not give you the right to bash guilds like para or stars for getting ahead or lick ensidia's ass at every opportunity, just makes you look like assholes.<br />

With every thing we do or say people find a reason of turning it into something to hate. When we congratulate another guild on their kill, it's somehow hate as well. Seriously.<br />
<br />
<br />
LOL. You have sponsors and your raiders get paid.<br />
<br />
Suck it up. You've accused other guilds of exploits or clever use of game mechanics in the past when you have done just as worse, yet somehow your stuff doesn't stink because it's too famous. Bottom line - Ensidia is the most famous guild in the world (although not for long, the way you've been slipping) and as such, you're going to have to deal with some people trying to bring you down a peg. Again - suck it up, deal with it.</div></div><hr />

Also a funny quote from a blog post on their site regarding Anub'arak and TM:<br />
<br />
Once again failure to test classes and encounters resulted in it being killed using a major bug. Now I do not blame the guilds for that because if it's there why not use it, but Blizzard really fail us by not giving us a level playing field to compete on (this is a continuing theme).<br />

ok, I guess 24 really good players could carry one guy. But if the one player was really good at being bad, he could make the raid's life a living nightmare. <br />

<br />
are you sarcasm resistant? I was obviously joking! a top guild doesn't become top by dragging one guy through a raid, everyone needs to know exactly what to do and do his job. <br />
<br />
if it was so simple, then why don't we get more news like that? And even if it is that simple, a majority of the haters will still never achieve it. <br />
<br />
it's a videogame ffs, if you don't want to congratulate to a region first then drop it. This is exactly why lots of people say this community is so full of crap. Which is quite sad since there is a huge potential behind the wow community and it works pretty well in some cases. <br />

<br />
A 2% wipe is still a wipe, and no one cares how close you were to almost getting a world 2nd.<br />
<br />
Gratz to Ensidia, but this is not front page news worthy. If people want to know Ensidia updates they can go to Ensidia's website. <br />
<br />
Edit: I understand that it's a EU first, but it's a world 3rd at this point. Front page news should be world firsts and nothing else -- the rest can be posted on the forums by anyone willing to share the news.<br />
<br />
<br />
So why shoudnt Ensidia get EU first kill front post when other guilds like Stars get world second/Asia first on other accomplishes or even worse, Jaggernaut world SECOND KILL<br />
<br />
It's no point beeing rude against Ensidia just because the world expect them to be best and then suddenly another guild comes before them?<br />
<br />
I just say it. QQ all you want because your favorite guild that you would probably pay 1000$ to be in, isnt the best anymore. <br />

Those pay like 10k for a first place finish, so thats &quot;only&quot; 3333,33x per person.<br />
Without having a sponsor you have no-one to pick up the tab for your hotel room, food and beverages, hookers etc.<br />
And even if you win em all with the same set of guys while having a sponsor (That doesn't want a piece of your earnings) you make like 15k a year at the most :P</div></div><hr />

So, anyone that flames anyone for not getting world 1st are pathetic. I'm sure Ensidia are 'butthurt' as would anyone be if they lost something they tried hard to get, but in the end of the day, they know they weren't good enough, not because of lag, not because of the boss, but because of themselves and from this they'll do what any human does and puts in more effort.</div></div><hr />

I find it hilarious that everyone thinks you got to be a god at the game to be in a guild like Ensidia. All you need to do is be situational sound player while dps/heal/etc. It's really not that hard to do as people make it out to be. To think there is only 25-50 good players in the game is just ignorant. <br />
<br />
The key isn't the player, it's getting 24 other guys like yourself that can do that as well. That's what makes one guild stand out over another. I know tons of crap guilds with 1-2 simply amazing players but theyre technically only as good as their worst raider.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, I agree with this. On my 'lock, I joined the server's.... Second best Alliance guild for progression, and did FL+4 25 and a 2-5% wipe (maybe even 1%) on XT 25 HM within 3-4 weeks of hitting 80, I was also about #10 on damage done on XT. Skill &gt; Gear when it comes to end game raiding, especially hard modes like this. Yes, the gear DOES help, but it is not essential (as the Yogg in blues shows!)<br />

You were created by Europe. You came from there at one time. You jump into the war YEARS later because the Japanese pissed you off, and the war was nearing the end too. It's good to see history from different points of view. Because it's rather biased when it's written. Your average health care is terrible though, http://www.photius.com/rankings/healthranks.html Congrats on 37. A lot of those great minds come from other countries and study in yours, because you have more money and therefore more to give to fund research ect. And that's mostly for your Higher tier of education.

Today we salute you, Mr. Forum Superhero.

Wasn't debating the significance of what's in the screenshot, just putting it into the proper context. Either way, the person I quoted quite simply had it wrong and was using their idiotic assumption to try to attack other people.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, for the people going on about &quot;Americans all have European ancestors anyway&quot; I just have one thing to say.

Because it's rather biased when it's written. Your average health care is terrible though, http://www.photius.com/rankings/healthranks.html Congrats on 37. A lot of those great minds come from other countries and study in yours, because you have more money and therefore more to give to fund research ect. And that's mostly for your Higher tier of education. Regular teaching at high schools, is under the norm(Except for Private's). http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2008016<br />

I'm sorry but World War II began on September 1st, 1939 and lasted until September 2nd,1945. The United States joined in after Pearl Harbor which was on December 7th, 1941. Lets do some basic math here:<br />
<br />
1945-1939= 6 years. We were in the war since 1941 so that makes it...4 years! 2/3 of the war. So no dumbass, we didn't join when the war was ending. When we joined the European front Germany had the entire continent by the balls and was bombing London to hell and back, the war was a joint effort but without American intervention by means of men and equipment UK would have fallen soon after. I really can't believe you'd say the war was coming to an end, what a blatantly ignorant comment.<br />
<br />
Also I would suggest researching the Marshall Plan which helped put money back into the ruins that was Europe. It gave new life to EVERY participant country(except Germany).<br />
<br />
Disliking a country is one thing, but being ignorant of the going ons of history is another.</div></div><hr />

By December, we had won the Battle of Britain and established aerial dominance over the Luftwaffe, preventing Hitler from engaging operation Sealion.<br />

I guess it's a matter of semantics. The way you wrote implied that in december we were still being bombed, when we'd just basically stopped it ;P<br />
<br />
Edit:: And it was mostly South London bombed anyway, since the fuel tanks on Germany's bombers were absolutely the worst in range.</div></div><hr />

You're not reading what I'm typing. Believe it or not, the border of North America isn't also the southern border of the US. I also believe some french-canadians play on european realms, but I don't know how widespread that is.<br />
<br />
It's Europe vs the US. It's a guild that's getting sponsorship to play and still using questionable methods to progress vs guilds that play without any form of outside monetary compensation. It's a collection of people from many countries against a small enough number of nations to be counted on one hand. I was impressed when a guild from ONE specific European nation was mentioned on the front page. I'm not as impressed when a guild formed from people that come from a large conglomeration of nations manage to accomplish something.<br />

c) I still need confirmation on that the rumoured oozeling exploit really worked, until then I just class it as bshit.<br />
e) There is absolutely no proof of anyone in Nihilum ever using said exploit if it does exist - just a player having a macro on his bar that happens to have the same icon. Did you ever stop to think about that if you was indeed to make a cancleaura macro for this potential exploit to work, you would need to select an icon. This icon could be ANY ICON FROM 500 different icons.<br />

You can use that for every bug. Exodus got world first yogg 0 I suppose... <br />

1st gz to Ensidia.. even if wasnt Ensidia here on post would deserve a gz<br />
<br />
but the most important part is:<br />
who the f*ck are you wannabes, that make hate posts about it? you cant even kill the 1st boss in normal mode and you whinning about their progress?<br />
<br />
They made EU 1st, probably next time they ll make world... who knows.. the truth is, its a competiotion, its hard to win allways... and you retards keep this emo/nerdrage toward a guild that till today proved to be excelent.</div></div><hr />

Grats to Ensidia by the way.</div></div><hr />

Man i can remember the days when europe would send 4 teams to the counterstrike CPL in america, and they would trounce everyone there. Maybe that's where the bitterness comes from, you are just horrible at all games. Must be all the burgers you eat.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jsemon2</div><div class="date">2009-09-25, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">are you sarcasm resistant? I was obviously joking! a top guild doesn't become top by dragging one guy through a raid, everyone needs to know exactly what to do and do his job. <br />
<br />
if it was so simple, then why don't we get more news like that? And even if it is that simple, a majority of the haters will still never achieve it. <br />
<br />
simple fact is that it is rough, thus rare, to see a guild completely full of players that know how to play from one situation to the next and still do their main roll as a healer/dps/tank/etc. then it's another to put 25 together that actually function with each other and not constantly bitching at each other. <br />
<br />
you just dont see those guilds just lying around on every server at a dime a dozen. you see guilds with about 10 decent guys carrying the rest and constantly having to look for replacements who either dont do their job or just dont mix well with the guild. <br />
<br />
but we all should know this and have seen it personally. like i said, the concept of what theyre doing is very simple and basic. it's just a matter of getting the people to execute it. no where did i say they're bad or said it's not worthy to note. i was just replying to someone's comment.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">enbee</div><div class="date">2009-09-25, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grats and all that but what's next iowa's first tribute to insanity? Is this news? World first or nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
I remember in the past when Ensidia got world firsts, or even very recently when Paragon got one, there was a newspost for a U.S. first, you have a very short memory, or you're a cock :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zodiac</div><div class="date">2009-09-25, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">gz on being 3rd .. if you're a high end raiding guild that competes for world firsts , i dont see this as a major achivement ..<br />
<br />
Specially when you guys are 1 week ahead of several guilds with your dual-clear/ tribute to skill and tribute to mad skill in the same reset ... so any guild that gets the achievement this week will still be ahead of you guys in terms on resets needed to achieve this .. <br />
<br />
When you guys transfered i really wasnt expecting you guys to clear the place again that week , not because you couldnt cuz by transfering the raid ID's get reseted but because i want expecting you guys to be so flame-friendly , that clearly was smtg to piss off ppl .. too bad it turned out to be another black page on Ensidia's History ..<br />
<br />
Despite all this i believe that it is something remarkable having in mind all raiding population so i have nothing else to say rather that gz for it , and i truly expect you guys to became world's best guild in icecrown , without any excuses , whining about everything and putting the blame on everything else rather than in yourselves for not being 1st anymore , and plz no more of this 2 x clear per reset , i know it was 1 time situation but just because it is possible to do it doesnt mean that it is fair to do it , specially in the conditions you guys are raiding , aiming for worlds 1st ,,,</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zodiac</div><div class="date">2009-09-25, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">World first or nothing , as some1 said it just the same as congratulate a team for ending 3rd in the league ...<br />
<br />
the words should be , shape up and aim for 1st next season ... <br />
<br />
GL ensidia in icecrown , you guys can really regain world's best guild title , just play fair and humble , like the guilds that out played you did ...</div></div><hr />

That is hilarious. WoW isn't hard, it's memorizing boss patterns and making sure you don't die. It's Super Mario Bros. but with 10 or 25 people. Don't act like it's hard and it's a giant accomplishment than people are able to beat Bowser, because people have been doing that since 1984.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;link your armory&quot; response I'll probably get, I'm sorry, but my self-esteem isn't tied into a video game. I assure you I have beat Super Mario Bros. though, I guess I could record it if it will make you feel better though to prove I can memorize a boss pattern. Of course, since WoW introduced a number of people to video games, you believe your accomplishments in the game are important, when I can freely say, they're not.</div></div><hr />

You play the &quot;I'm butthurt, but try to cover it up&quot; routine rather well.<br />

I'm an American who doesn't eat burgers and who could give a shit less who is better at a video game than me. It actually quite sad to get any sense of territorial pride from a fucking video game. You euro queers (not all euros, mind you, just the queer ones and not queer as in likes men, but dildo queers) are just so easy to troll by simply saying, America fuck yeah! And off you go into a rant of inadequacy about how Europe is better at this and at that. Ohhh we are good at video games, ohhh our CONTINENT got more gold medals than your COUNTRY. It just goes to show your individual countries fail so hard that you have to group yourselves up and just claim your continent. Shit I only claim US cause it pisses you fruits off. California and only California love. The rest of the US sucks, especially Iowa that's why I brought up that crap state, cause who really gives a shit about Iowa... id be like some one caring about Sweden. Italy and Ireland rule though, cause those are the motherland. And Norway rules too because of Turbonegro. And trust me, Ive been to every state and every one of your bum fuck European countries, California rules them all. Now dance puppets.<br />
<br />
Oh and Counterstrike is for queers, true story.</div></div><hr />
