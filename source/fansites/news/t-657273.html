PTR Raid and Dungeon Testing (July 16)<br />
Here's the current schedule for Trial of the Crusader PTR testing:<br />
<br />
On all realms:<br />
<br />
The Trial of the Champion dungeon will be available shortly after the PTR coming up.<br />
<br />
On the North American test realms:<br />
<br />
[b]Lord Jaraxxus - Thursday Night, July 16, starting at 7pm EDT. Normal Only.<br />
Northrend Beasts - Friday Night, July 17, starting at 7pm EDT. Normal and Heroic.<br />
Faction Champions - Friday Night, July 17, starting at 7pm EDT. Normal and Heroic.<br />
<br />
On the European test realms:<br />
<br />
Val'kyr - Friday Night, July 17, starting at 19:00 CEST. Normal and Heroic.<br />
Lord Jaraxxus - Friday Night, July 17, starting at 19:00 CEST. Normal and Heroic.<br />
Anub'arak - Saturday Night, July 18, starting at 19:00 CEST. Normal and Heroic.<br />
<br />
Some of the tests will have multiple bosses and difficulties available for testing, as noted above.<br />
<br />
Test Patchwerks (Tank and DPS versions) will also be available in the Argent Coliseum during similar times to other bosses. Instead of the previous tank test patchwerk that increased melee damage over time, the 3.2 tank test patchwerk will just hit VERY hard (as hard as Algalon) all the time to allow for more lengthy sustained tank parses. We're always interested in seeing combat logs and parses for all raid testing on the PTR, but especially test patchwerk logs. These are extremely helpful to our class team.<br />
<br />
This schedule could change at a moment's notice due to server, bug, or patch status. I'll try to keep everyone informed as much as possible. The Trial of the Crusader and the bosses to be tested will remain also open a variable length of time. How long they stay open depends upon a host of factors including designer availability, bug status, etc. These bosses are very much a work in progress, and this is a test server.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quick Trial of the Crusader FAQ:<br />
Q) Where's all the trash?<br />
A) There isn't any in this raid zone. Really.<br />
<br />
Q) Where's the loot?<br />
A) Loot is present on the bosses, but note that many of the items do not have final art.<br />
<br />
Q) What about achievements?<br />
A) Most all of them are implemented now.</div></div><hr />

Earth shock is no longer an interupt? ....wtf....<br />
<br />
<br />
You get a new spell that has same cool down but doesn't start other shock's cd, I think. So the only drawback is you have to find a place for one more button.<br />
<br />
<br />
And um, for the feral idol change, are they saying that they're removing the bear part, or that there was a bug of sorts that allowed cats to proc their effect off of cat swipe or something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My thoughts exactly. Not only that, but they're testing EVERY boss' Normal and Hard Modes, including the final one's (Anub'arak). This is such a huge kick in the nuts. Not only will it take 5 weeks to actually open up the Heroic version of the Coliseum, but we'll already have tested everything on PTR? Unless these Heroic versions drastically alter the fight mechanics and heavily tune the encounters towards impossible, 3.2 will be completely cleared before the sixth reset of the instance, including all hard modes.</div></div><hr />

It's been like this for a while. (In a hotfix) It's just a tooltip update.<br />

Fine, except for the fact that we'll be clearing it by the sixth reset as well. If the PTR is any indication, pretty much any of us guilds that have killed Algalon right now will just breeze through everything in 3.2 without batting an eyelash.<br />
<br />
Pre-nerf Firefighter and Yogg+0 prove Blizzard can still make amazing encounters. Hopefully that's still the case with the Coliseum, but that will remain to be seen.</div></div><hr />

This really.<br />
Its not that big of a change, everyone could trinket the stuns but casters still had to wait for the interrupt to fade away.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheDesertDragon</div><div class="date">2009-07-16, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it is a very big deal. The fact that there is a potentual interrupt meant that people would be fakecasting it - especially the stupid people.<br />
<br />
Now, they don't. Every single prot paladin I know of that I have told that ferals has no interrupt just stands still in one place and spams Flash of Light until I fall asleep.<br />
<br />
And even if he is losing some mana, Divine Plea gets it all back.<br />
<br />
In other words: This change makes ferals 100% PATHETIC.</div></div><hr />

Blizz has said in the 3.2 patchnotes that the instance will have 4 versions. 10 man normal/heroic and 25 man normal/heroic. So eventho its tested before release i think that between normal 10 and 25 heroic the difficulty will go up alot.</div></div><hr />

If you would care about only yourself (&quot;nerf others, buff me&quot; anyone?), you would get pissed that your guild will force you to know everything about it from others in PTR instead of letting you discover by yourself.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll try to remind you of this when you join the &quot;more content blizz! not farming this one since day 1 that long!&quot; bandwagon.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure it was functional in 3.0.8. It was introduced with WotLK. <br />
<br />
Bosses that aren't immune to interrupt obviously.</div></div><hr />

Looks like US testing of Lord Jaraxxus won't be happening tonight... PTRs are coming up again soon though, I think. Patch is done downloading and just waiting on the servers to update.</div></div><hr />

Actually, if you would read the Tooltip (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/67353/item-druid-t9-feral-relic-lacerate-swipe-mangle-an/) of the spell:<br />
<br />
While in Bear Form, your Lacerate and Swipe abilities have a chance to grant 200 dodge rating for 9 sec, and your Cat Form's Mangle and Shred abilities have a chance to grant 200 Agility for 16 sec. you'd notice it's just a bug fix, or even just a tooltip clarification. Bear's Mangle doesn't proc the Agi buff.</div></div><hr />

More and more i feel that we are going back to the beginning of vanila, no one wanting to play druid. on the server where i play there are only 10 real feral druids left on alliance and talked to a couple, after patch all go moonkin or healing. BLIZZARD STOP NERVING ALL OUR TANKING AND OTHER SKILLS &gt;:(</div></div><hr />

As an enhance shaman I use Earth Shock a lot for the interrupt and the damge it does. Leaving us with Wind Shear (rename of Wind Shock) as our only interrupt really sucks. <br />
<br />
Don't other classes have damaging interrupt effects?<br />
<br />
If the 10% attack speed debuff stacked more than once, then it might be cool, but 10% doesn't seem like a lot to me. Especially since it doesn't stack with other similar effects from what's been posted.<br />
<br />
I think warriors have a similar effect -- is 10% significant?</div></div><hr />

I, personally, think that was a great change.. I can now use Earth shock for damage, instead of having to save it for an interrupt. Every little bit helps, right?</div></div><hr />
