I tried this on an alt that I definitely know didn't complete it last year, and only got the achievement and a couple random stuff - no toy. I think I will have to wait for a hotfix. :\</div></div><hr />

It's because Blizzard forgot to reset the quest completion flag for &quot;A Gently Shaken Gift&quot;. Managed to get it on an Alliance alt that was created late this year, but it looks like I'll have to wait for a hotfix for the Horde version. =/</div></div><hr />

100% - and you only have to have a level 10 I believe to get those toys on each faction correct?</div></div><hr />

I'm actually wondering if it's possible to use class trial guys for the daily to get a chance on the Winter/Ragnaros enchant :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hate to tell you but they've had small Hearthstone things in the game since WoD with the card toy because Hearthstone is currently based around the WARCRAFT universe. But hey if you really feel that way over a small toy that will probably just be a number in a lot of peoples collection then feel free to.<br />
<br />
It's common for a game company to sometimes promote other games within their own universe in a minor way. We've had pets based on other games for years from Digital Deluxe editions of other games for example. <br />
<br />
Hope that has cleared things up for you.<br />
<br />
But yes I'm sure a majority of people will look at the Hearthstation and suddenly go and get Hearthstone and instantly buy 100 packs... :rolleyes: By your own logic of advertisement this already happened with the toy Hearthstone card back when it was introduced yes?<br />
<br />
As for the toy weapons set well don't get what that's specifically advertising other than specific factions. I mean if you really want to stretch there I guess you could say Battle for Azeroth but then any item that has the Horde or Alliance symbol on post Blizzcon must be which is just silly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, as a person who have every single card in my Hearthstone collection I can tell that you're overreacting on my words. Yes, it is still an advertisement and I personally don't like the fact that it's a christmas present.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eleccybubb</div><div class="date">2017-12-26, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as a person who have every single card in my Hearthstone collection I can tell that you're overreacting on my words.

<br />
It's a minor one at best. Especially considering there are two toys this year and the other one is both Warcraft related and tied to the achievement. The Hearthstation is not. So if anything it's a bonus present.<br />
<br />
Hearthstone is based on the Warcraft universe for now. What's wrong with the Warcraft universe having a toy based on a universe it essentially spawned?<br />
<br />
Do you have an issue with the Starcraft pets being in the game since by your own logic they advertise them? Because technically that's been going on since 2004 with the Zergling pet and hell even Diablo pet.<br />
<br />
By all means you are allowed to dislike and I would not tell you otherwise.<br />
<br />
Seems to me you are just looking for something to have a go at them for here. This is most certainly not one of those things among the other issues.</div></div><hr />

Man ... you are awesome - and obviously MUCH smarter than all these other pathetic plebs trying to figure out how to get the item instead of realizing they are being trolled by the Blizz marketing team. <br />
<br />
Let me just say 'thank you' ... and 'thank you again', for being a cut above the rest of us. At first I almost confused you for a cynical 13 year old trying to show everyone how smart they are - but on second take, you are actually one of the shining lights bringing truth to us sheeply masses. <br />
<br />
Did I say thank you already? If not, thank you and I think I'll go and delete my item right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I do, but because of different reasons. I don't like comical additions to not blatantly comical universe. They look too out of place. But this is my opinion even tho I guess I'm in minority here.<br />

Heaven forbid they try to raise awareness of their other products with a toy that is nowhere near a representation of the actual game. #BoycottBlizzard</div></div><hr />
