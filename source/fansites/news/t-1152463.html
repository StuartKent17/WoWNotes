<br />
Account Wide Mounts Update<br />
We have been discussing this issue the last couple of days and we made the call to make the following mounts account-wide:<br />
<br />
<br />
Reins of the Traveler's Tundra Mammoth (http://www.wowdb.com/items/44234)<br />
Reins of the Grand Expedition Yak (http://www.wowdb.com/items/84101)<br />
Mechano-Hog (http://www.wowdb.com/items/41508)<br />
Mekgineer's Chopper (http://www.wowdb.com/items/44413)<br />
Vial of the Sands (http://www.wowdb.com/items/65891)<br />
Reins of the Grand Ice Mammoth (http://www.wowdb.com/items/44086)<br />
Reins of the Ice Mammoth (http://www.wowdb.com/items/44080)<br />
Jeweled Onyx Panther (http://www.wowdb.com/items/82453) (all color variants)<br />
Cloud Serpents (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87777) (all color variants) <br />
<br />
<br />
At this point, the only mounts that are not account-wide are either class specific or rewarded from PVP. We feel like both these types of mounts should still be character specific.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your feedback on this issue! <br />
<br />
<br />
Challenge Mode Valor Rewards<br />
Valor Point rewards were added to the Challenge Mode UI in a recent patch, but we have no word on if they are final yet. As a comparison, doing a random Heroic Dungeon rewards 60 Valor Points, and a random scenario rewards 30 Valor Points.<br />
<br />
It is very unlikely the times that you see are final, as they are the same for every dungeon. <br />

Scholomance<br />
Individuals seeking to master the powers of undeath know well of Scholomance, the infamous school of necromancy located in the dark and foreboding crypts beneath Caer Darrow. In recent years, several of the instructors have changed, but the institution remains under the control of Darkmaster Gandling, a particularly sadistic and insidious practitioner of necromantic magic.<br />

Beta Class Balance Analysis<br />
How committed is the development team to having all tanks perform within an &quot;acceptable variance&quot; on all encounters? In Cataclysm we saw several &quot;niches&quot; become severe problems for tank balance on certain heroic encounters. For example:<br />
<br />
Deathknights on Yor'Sahj, &quot;Bearcatting&quot; on Madness, Spine, Ultra, and Blackhorn, Deathknight and Druid compared to Paladin and Warrior for Impales on Madness, Warriors for Blood tanking on Spine, Paladins for most of heroic T12 due to Divine Guardian, and Warrior/Druid/Deathknight vs Paladin on Al'Akir.<br />
We don't think any of those cross the line. If it were the same class showing up for all of those bullet points, that would be a problem. Our tanks all have strengths and weaknesses and unusual encounter mechanics may synergize or clash with them, but that's more interesting than extreme homogeneity, which would be the alternative. We like the puzzle aspect of &quot;solving&quot; boss encounters according to the comp and strengths of individual groups. We think it has helped contribute to the fun of killing bosses having such extraordinary legs (meaning that we're on tier 14 now and have made hundreds of dungeon bosses).<br />
<br />
If memory serves the first Spine kill was Blood DK / Prot paladin and the second was a pair of druids. Now granted, world firsts sometimes have to resort to unusual strategies since they undergear the fights because they haven't had weeks to farm up better gear. Your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
As a counter-example, paladins on Heroic Major Domo initially were able to solo-soak the scorpion cleave, letting guilds with paladin tanks keep him in scorpion form longer than those without. We thought that crossed the line and we changed the boss mechanics to disincentivize that particular strategy. I fully admit that these calls are subjective.<br />
<br />
It was explained that &quot;Expertise will negate dodge and spell miss, then parry&quot;. No. I've tested this. Expertise reduces Dodge then Parry. Paperdoll is wrong and hasn't been updated yet.<br />
Expertise does indeed reduce dodge and then parry. The character sheet itself does not appear to update correctly.<br />
<br />
You're missing the point. Expertise doesn't help spell miss, which is a huge problem for any melee class that still has abilities on the spell hit table.<br />
As far as we know, it does (and if it does not, it's a bug). You can't trust the tooltip in this case, because as I said, it is not yet updating -- you would have to actually test it in game.<br />
<br />
Some follow ups on things that I said we’d investigate. More still to come. This thread has been great. Please try to keep it focused on theorycrafting discussion (&quot;How does Combat Potency’s proc chance work?&quot;) and not general Q&amp;A (&quot;Explain your design intent with X&quot;). Thanks!<br />
<br />
<br />
Pet Scaling: Still working on a more comprehensive description of our new pet scaling system. Please continue to report things that seem like bugs or inconsistencies. Shadowy Apparitions: Looks like this got fixed sometime recently; its damage matches the tooltip now. Not sure which way was correct, but an example data point is that it does 19908 damage with 16334 spell power and Shadowform and no other buffs. Gargoyle and Haste: It was incorrectly getting only melee haste from the DK, not spell haste. It now gets spell haste from your highest haste. Barrage vs Powershot: We’re currently planning to reduce Barrage’s damage a bit, so that it ends up being on par with the others on the row in terms of overall DPS. Frost DK Weapon Twisting: We’re looking for a more elegant way to solve this, but may end up just disabling Threat of Thassarian and Might of the Frozen Wastes for ~10 sec whenever you swap weapons. Obviously, the weapon twisting behavior is not what we want to encourage; we want Frost DKs to choose either DW or 2H, and stick with that choice (and have them be competitive choices). Spinning Crane Kick: Will only generate Chi if it hits at least 3 targets. Malefic Grasp: There’s another bugfix coming still for this so it won’t match what you see quite yet, but here’s how it should work:<br />
<br />
1) DoT hastening of Malefic Grasp and Drain Soul back to +100%, from +50%.<br />
<br />
2) Damage of MG and DS reduced, so that the total DPS gain remains constant (-40% to MG, -13.333% to DS).<br />
<br />
3) Since MG once again simply doubles tick rate, it effectively means there should be an additional tick between each existing tick. So, if MG is active during a midpoint between normal ticks, an extra tick goes off. Brain Freeze with Multi-DoTing: Brain Freeze will only be triggered by your most recently applied bomb.<br />

Nature's Vigil is currently affecting Frenzied Regeneration. That doesn't seem intentional.<br />
I believe the intention is that the healing amount is increased, but that it does not deal damage based on that healing.<br />
<br />
Here are some more incoming changes relevant to Balance Druid theorycrafters. <br />
<br />
We are experimenting with some changes to the rotation. No promises that these changes will stay, but we definitely look forward to your feedback (both in terms of theorycrafting and how fun it is). Shooting Stars should occur much more frequently, and Starsurge should be a more important (read: high damage) button. Additionally, we’re adding a new passive that has some interesting implications. Should you choose to ignore it, your DPS will likely be only a few percentage behind someone who uses it optimally, but it should hopefully provide some more varied gameplay. To use some game designer jargon, we’re happy with Moonkins’ macro level rotational gameplay, but think they needs some more mirco-level decisions. <br />
<br />
<br />
Shooting Stars chance increased from 20% to 50%. Starsurge damage increased by 30%. Fae Empowerment: New passive for Balance Druids. When you cast Faerie Fire, you gain Lunar Empowerment and Solar Empowerment. Lunar Empowerment: Increases the damage of your next 3 Starfires within 15 sec by 15%. Solar Empowerment: Increases the damage of your next 3 Wraths within 15 sec by 20%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please note that these changes are straight DPS buffs, and we don’t think Moonkin need a buff right now, so we need to reduce overall damage (probably across the board) so that overall DPS stays the same. These nerfs may take a few builds, because we need to evaluate if these rotation changes are worth doing. However, don't be surprised when you see them, and help spread the word when you see the inevitable &quot;I can't believe we were nerfed!&quot; posts. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter))<br />
I'm curious about the Hunter technique of macro'ing Fox and Hawk into cast time/instant shots, respectively, to maximize uptime with the Hawk AP buff while moving.<br />
We don't consider that fun gameplay. You're basically opting out of Aspects as a mechanic and just always benefiting from the right Aspect because you're &quot;clever&quot; enough to know there is a macro. Usually in this situation we put the &quot;stance&quot; on the normal GCD or make the shared GCD longer.<br />
<br />
Barrage: This ability seems to do 400% weapon damage in total but it does not seem to be normalized, unlike powershot which is normalized (as well as just about every other hunter ability). Is this an oversight or is it not normalized for a reason?<br />
Bug (and a slightly sneaky one). The issues you raise with Murder of Crows and Dire Beast are one of the challenges with summoned creatures. It's possible they won't always get the same number of attacks off, but we can balance around the average.<br />
<br />
As an aside, we have a lot of abilities that summon extra creatures for hunters, including Stampede. This can create client performance problems on lower end machines, so we may ultimately have to redesign some of them. (We don't want to hear raid or BG leaders asking hunters not to use certain abilities.) Stampede would be the last one we touch.<br />
<br />
Nowhere was a promise made that Piercing Shots, Mastery, et al. would be exempt from break CC. &quot;Not a fair requirement&quot; and &quot;probably do need to pause&quot; are not the words of a promise.<br />
If you CC someone (say Scatter Shot, Freezing Traps and Wyvern Sting) and your autoshot gets turned off but Piercing Shots or Wild Quiver merrily break the CC, then that's a bug. If you CC someone and then keep shooting at them, then you're a bad hunter, and it's fine to break the CC. (In other words, you're supposed to choose between CC or damage.) Serpent Sting is a bit of a gray area, because you do have control over whether you put it up. You could be in a situation where you have a dot up and then decide to CC that target, but that situation happens for a variety of classes. We provide the glyphs for that situation. (Like everything else we discuss in this thread, none of that is set in stone.) <br />

Hi Doctor Street. A question has arisen concerning the mage tier 6 talents and if we'll be balanced around 100 up time on their use for our dps to be competitive with other classes.<br />
Are Mages going to be balanced under the assumption that they have perfect 100% uptime of their level 90 talents? No. Are they going to be balanced under the assumption that they take one of them and use it reasonably well? Yes. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk))<br />
Is that a range Mistweaver or a melee one?<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin))<br />
Currently because of the mana cost of spells and how slowly we generate Holy Power, I'm basically relying on Holy Shock and Holy light, with some WoG's / Eternal Flame on the tank. But I'm almost forced to not use Flash of Light of Divine Light because of the mana cost to heal ratio. More than a few casts of either of those will put me in the danger zone of going oom, with not a lot of healing to show for it. Also Holy Radiance doesnt do nearly as much AoE healing as it was in Cataclysm, where i could rely on it to keep the group up during rough raid damage periods.<br />
Holy Radiance is quite overpowered on many Dragon Soul fights, so I wouldn't use that as a yardstick for how spells should perform. Many of the nerfs we have made to Holy paladin healing over the course of beta have come about when our internal raid tests were dominated by Holy paladins (both throughput and efficiency) and Mistweaver monks. We'll compare these results to healers on beta now that raid tests are open.<br />

What was the decision process behind moving Vampiric Embrace from a passive ability to an active one? <br />
In order to balance it, the number either needs to be very small, or the duration needs to be less than 100%. We generally think active abilities are more engaging than passive ones, so we went with the latter.<br />
<br />
As far as your other Shadow questions go, I suggest just waiting until the next build so that you can see all of the numbers. It might take a lot of time to explain via text that would just lead to more questions. If the intent still isn't clear at that point, we can clear things up.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman))<br />
Currently Stormlash totem is scaling to ridiculous levels for certain classes(I've noticed Warlocks, Balance Druids, and Warriors so far) getting almost 400% more usage out of the totem than the myself as Elemental(With 2 back to back totems during heroism it did 300k damage for myself, but 1.2m for the warrior, 1.6m for the demo lock, 1.6m for the Balance druid.) Are you going to balance this down to those classes and then look at Stormlash and balance it around 25m but make sure it'll still be worth it for 10m.<br />
That sounds off. It is possible something is proc'ing it than we don't intend. We don't want the shaman dropping the totem just to make someone else super awesome. It's a matter of degree -- if melee benefit a little more, no big deal. If some specs get 400%, then that may lead to a stacking issue. If it becomes a mandatory raid cooldown, then that's a problem. The benefit should be more like Shattering Throw -- nice to have, but not mandatory. (Mandatory tends to be in the eye of the beholder however.)<br />

Level 90 Premade Character Availability<br />
We are not planning on making new max-level template characters available in the near future, so if you're looking to participate in testing the Normal or Heroic versions of the Mists raid zones, you'll want to level to 90 in the beta.<br />
<br />
By way of explanation: While we're excited about moving into the raid-testing phase of our beta, we're still looking closely at feedback and player behavior across all types of content, including the level-up experience and max-level daily quests. When we make raid-ready template characters available, that inevitably comes at the expense of the quality and quantity of testing in these other areas. In the past, this was an unavoidable sacrifice, since it was unrealistic to ask people to fully gear up for endgame raiding, much less Heroic raiding, in a beta environment. The new item-scaling system we have in place, however, provides an alternate solution.

Class specific mounts and pvp mounts wont be, although, isn't the Jewel Panther mount supposedly JC only? And that's going to be account wide, so that would be not all class specific mounts are then. Unless I am mistaken in which never mind then. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they want to make that mount seems special. So there's not a million characters just running around with the same PvP mount so they are distinguishable from our &quot;retarded PvE mounts&quot;; so everyone knows that this particular character is a BA.</div></div><hr />

Damn, somehow this makes me think that there is a lot of future for the beta, which is rather bad...<br />
<br />
I´m not so sure. As they write in the second part, the second they allow lv 90 templates almost no one will be testing the questing zones anymore and most people will just concentrate on the heroics and raids and i can understand that they don´t want that yet.<br />
And since the Beta is so large with all the annual pass people i guess they have enough lv 90 players already for their instances.</div></div><hr />

That would be the case if there were milion gladiatior, but truth is that there's no where near that many gladiators. Want proof? Here:<br />
<br />

http://wow-achievements.com/achievements/feats-of-strength/none/relentless-gladiators-frostwyrm/ Season 7 0.3% of total playerbase have it.<br />
<br />
a grand total of 4% WOULD have it if previous season winners were blocked from the next ones (no way in hell) So realisticly we can drop this to 2,5~3% and even then we would have to assume that all of them still play (very unlikely) and since blizzard once admitted that there are more players who dont play WoW anymore then there are playing currently, we can safely cut the % number to about 2~2,5%. Counting it from the grand total of players WoW had at it's peak (14 mln) we would have a grand total of 280k to 350k still active gladiators. Spreading them all over 236 WoW Realms we have approx 1,2k to 1,5k gladiators per server... Quite a lot eh? That would also include if all of them would play at the same time (not likely) and still not get fed up with those mounts (more likely). <br />
<br />
So yeah... we have no where millions of Arena mounts and there is no chance in hell they will be all over the place.</div></div><hr />

You do realize they are talking about a feature that is not going to be in-game until... MOP is already released, right? :P<br />

Glad for the changes. I know some people are auction house barons and can obtain those mounts easily, but the average player has to scrimp and save for quite some time. It can be just as big an obstacle as grinding out reputations, if not even more so.</div></div><hr />

You're going to get more business from new customers then you would from repeat customers just buying mounts for alts. The majority of players that collect mounts collect mounts on a single toon and get one or two of their favorite mounts for their alts. You'll now see many more people in the market than were previously. Demand goes up and supply goes down then prices go up. Everybody wins.</div></div><hr />

Yep. That mount you spent 15 thousand gold on? Sure. That's account wide. That mount that you lucked into as a drop from some boss, that you happened to be awarded? Yep. That's account wide. That Glory of the... Drake that you earned? yep. That's account wide. <br />
<br />
That Drake you earned for being one of the top PvP'ers in a season? NO. NO. YOU CAN'T DISPLAY THAT ON EVERY CHARACTER <br />
<br />
And before you start saying that I'm being an elitist PvP Prick, Let me reassure you, I'm not. I don't even have a single character on my account with 5k Honorable Kills. I don't PvP. I just think that it's a truckload of horse manure that I can display my Glory of the Ulduar Raider 25 drake that I got during ICC (You know, after we had 2 tiers of gear to make it easy) on all of my toons, but the guy who went out there, and housed people in Arena, can't display their Drake on whatever toon they happen to want to play. <br />

I don't care about the ground mounts. You can buy those with Justice Points, they can stay single toon. But, the Gladiator Mounts? How can you justify Glory of the Raider Mounts being Account wide, and not the Gladiator Mounts!</div></div><hr />

If it were the same class showing up for all of those bullet points, that would be a problem. Our tanks all have strengths and weaknesses and unusual encounter mechanics may synergize or clash with them, but that's more interesting than extreme homogeneity, which would be the alternative. We like the puzzle aspect of &quot;solving&quot; boss encounters according to the comp and strengths of individual groups. We think it has helped contribute to the fun of killing bosses having such extraordinary legs (meaning that we're on tier 14 now and have made hundreds of dungeon bosses).<br />
And yet again I am reminded of why I've lost faith in Blizzard. They don't see it as a problem because they look at it from the top of their ivory mountain and consider the design. They see the players in a raid group as building blocks to a puzzle, all the while forgetting that players only play ONE class on their character. And even then, a lot of people don't want to be forced to respec for the sake of that puzzle.<br />
<br />
If one class or spec is better than another, even for one specific fight, you could very likely get benched from that fight until it's put on farm (or be forced to play something you don't enjoy playing) - and who the hell cares about a fight once it's on farm? Even if it's &quot;boring&quot; the classes need to be equal on a per-fight basis, or else this &quot;puzzle-building&quot; will continue to cause players to be benched. I should be able to run into a progression fight with any composition, assuming a reasonable number of tanks/dps/heals obviously, and not feel like another composition is superior. I shouldn't feel like &quot;Damn, if they replaced me, the Enhance Shaman, with a Rogue, this boss would be dead already.&quot; It should be about player skill, not about what puzzle pieces you have.<br />
<br />
And gain, on the argument of respeccing: If you're willing to resepc, more power to you. Not everybody is. Players should not be forced to play something that they do not enjoy, just for the sake of progress. In the end, this is a game, and people play it for fun - a game is not the place for a &quot;success at all costs&quot; mentality.</div></div><hr />

The danger with this is class homogenization. If every class can perform equally on any encounter, then they will all feel the same. IMO they are better keeping small differences between classes. So what if warriors aren't as good in encounter A? If they're better than others in encounter B, it will equalize. Only the guilds rushing for server/region/world firsts will bench good raiders because of their class being bad, as long as the gap isn't immense.</div></div><hr />

Even if it's nice to have more SS procs, making it too good to the point that they need to nerf everything else would <br />
make the balance druids deal even lower damages while not in eclipse<br />
make us feel gimped in fights where we can't apply moonfire on more than one target<br />
reduce even more our &quot;burst&quot; in fights like Spine of DW Heroic because the moment we leave the eclipse our nuke's damages fall to abysmal levels<br />
it would not be a problem if the low damages would be balanced by more SS procs...but in fights where you need burst, those procs must be off the GCD. We already have to wait for the actual Starsurge to land before we can cast an instant one, having to wait the gcd every time it proc, in a target dummy fight where there's low movement it's like having 1.5 sec cast all the time becase we can't instantly continue to cast Wrath/Starfire (removing the feeling of the instant proc)<br />
make our pvp strategy even more reliant on moonfire spam because our nukes except starsurge would suck<br />
Shooting Stars chance increased from 20% to 50%.<br />
Starsurge damage increased by 30%.<br />
Fae Empowerment: New passive for Balance Druids. When you cast Faerie Fire, you gain Lunar Empowerment and Solar Empowerment.<br />
Lunar Empowerment: Increases the damage of your next 3 Starfires within 15 sec by 15%.<br />
Solar Empowerment: Increases the damage of your next 3 Wraths within 15 sec by 20%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please note that these changes are straight DPS buffs, and we don’t think Moonkin need a buff right now, so we need to reduce overall damage (probably across the board) so that overall DPS stays the same.</div></div><hr />

A lot of people said they won't buy certain gold sink mounts unless they'd be account wide, which would defeat the theory that they were banned so that people would spend gold for multiple toons.<br />
In most cases, I feel like letting them be account wide is more of a gold sink since a lot more people would be willing to buy the expensive mounts knowing that they would go to all of their toons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They both require a minimum amount of money to craft because the mats to make them are sold by vendors. Also most people don't buy somewhat expensive mounts for their alts, so I really don't see much changing. Plus now you can raise the price on them because people will only need to buy one of them for all of their toons.<br />

Class specific mounts and pvp mounts wont be, although, isn't the Jewel Panther mount supposedly JC only? And that's going to be account wide, so that would be not all class specific mounts are then. Unless I am mistaken in which never mind then. :)<br />
<br />
Engineer isn't a class it is a profession, and the Jeweled Panther is not JC only, from what I understand it is the equivalent of the motorcycle or the alchy drake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And for those of you who bought expensive mounts on multiple toons (same mounts); Blizz isn't going to do anything to appease you. Remember how much dual-speccing used to cost during Wrath? They dropped that down to nothing in Cata and no refunds were given to those of us who had purchased it on 6,7,8 toons. So I doubt they'll do anything to refund you all either.</div></div><hr />

Reins of the Traveler's Tundra Mammoth<br />
Reins of the Grand Expedition Yak<br />
Mechano-Hog<br />
Mekgineer's Chopper<br />
Vial of the Sands<br />

Reins of the Ice Mammoth<br />
Jeweled Onyx Panther (all color variants)<br />
Cloud Serpents (all color variants) <br />

At this point, the only mounts that are not account-wide are either class specific or rewarded from PVP. We feel like both these types of mounts should still be character specific.<br />

I don't know about other people but I at least am far more likely to dump large amounts of gold on a mount if I know it'll be account wide, than if it isn't.

Pretty much exactly what I said one page back. I couldn't agree more.<br />
Not everyone has large amounts of gold lying around, but people are more likely to grind for these 'gold sink' mounts if they're account wide. I knew a lot of people that just said screw it when they originally had these mounts on the ban list. Now that the ban is lifted on them, they're going to get these mounts.</div></div><hr />

I'm not too into the Curse video thingy, but I do think Pico is cute as hell. I've probably never watched a single episode from start to finish and from what I've gathered, she's really not that good with it, but there are worse actors/casters out there.

<br />
1000 people buying a 5000g mount once is better than 100 people buying a 5000g mount five times, though. If a mount only needs to be bought once, more people are likely to fork over gold for it.<br />
<br />
It'll be a more effective goldsink for the server economy, less of a gold sink for the ultra-rich characters. I suppose they have the BMAH to take care of the ultra-rich, and account-wide mounts to take care of the semi-rich.</div></div><hr />

Im less likely to &quot;Sink&quot; gold into a mount if I have to buy multiples of it. Now that I only need to buy ONE I might actually blow some gold on these mounts.
