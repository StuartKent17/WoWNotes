Weapons<br />
Endarion (again ! thanks to him) sent me some screenshots with color variations of already known items (even the tier 5 warlock sword has multiple colors). We can't really tell if it will be used in game in the near future, or if it will be released a lot later like it was in BC with the alternate version of tier 2 armor skins. <br />
