<br />
It'll hit you for 190k if you're holding the orb or with any other damage increase debuff.<br />
<br />
Chaos Bolt will NEVER hit an enemy for 190k if Dark Soul isn't activated and the enemy doesn't have some kind of debuff on him.<br />
<br />
Even Dark Soul alone doesn't make Chaos Bolt to hit that hard.<br />
<br />
Too much whining and misinformation. People have to complain about something, doesn't matter if it's Frost Bomb, Chaos Bolt or Starsurge.<br />
Guess what? It's an MMORPG, you'll be hit extremely hard eventually by some partially skilled enemy.<br />
<br />
I can assure you every class in this game has a way to hit the enemy extremely hard in some situations.<br />
By the way, this game would be very boring if this kind of thing didn't exist.<br />
<br />
Learn to avoid some damages and you'll eventually notice how you (and most of the community) need to learn how to stop crying about trivial things.</div></div><hr />

I get that they didn't want warlocks to have to keep RoF up on a single target, but they still didn't put in enough ember generation in its place.</div></div><hr />

I think you quoted the wrong person. I never said anything about PvP. I rarely do battlegrounds or arena. My only gripe is the lack of ember generation for Destruction in 5.4.</div></div><hr />

Rof was realy OP in pvp by just spamming it and getting crazy alot of ember generation. Plus destro was using this as single target.</div></div><hr />

It would have been better to increase Incinerate damage by 15%. But that probably won't happen, it makes too much sense!<br />

if your near the bottom on ptr your bad... ptr dk's are top by miles, this 'nerf' is sub 100 damage... it makes 0 difference, certainly wont knock you from top spot</div></div><hr />

That probably has something to do with the PvE trinket. CB damage is based on crit rating and it gives, what, like 100% chance to crit?</div></div><hr />
