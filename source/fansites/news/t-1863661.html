Starcraft II - Legacy of the Void Cinematic<br />
Blizzard announced (http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/19893687/legacy-of-the-void-launches-1110-watch-the-cinematic-now-9-13-2015) that Legacy of the Void will release November 10, 2015 along with the new cinematic today!<br />

Artcraft Updates<br />
We might get a followup to the old Cosmetic Class Accessories artcraft (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4008-Artcraft-Cosmetic-Class-Accessories) at some point in the future. They were originally described as ways to customize your character, rewarded through many different gameplay activities. Keep in mind that a somewhat similar system is coming with spec specific Artifact Weapons with multiple skins.<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
No reason to exchange words, because we will most likely never meet ingame again. Thoughts?<br />
The Finders were supposed to be for when your friends weren't available, not as a way to experience an MMO solo. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/641602564044165121))<br />
But the awesome convenience of quick matchmaking means why wait for friends? League has the same problem. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/641602790096171009))<br />
<br />
I think the game design philosophy changed to: Leveling = solo, PvP/Endgame = groups.<br />
I remember in vanilla having to ask friends to help for the Plagueland cauldron quests and a few others. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/641731084707717120))<br />
But I think it's fair that a lot of people just abandoned the group quests even when they capped off a story. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/641731154467405824))<br />

November 10th is also when Fallout comes out...kinda risky.<br />
<br />
Cosmetic class accessories...sounds a lot like transmog which also utilizes gameplay activities. But it just doesn't have the staying power like brand new raids and dungeons do. Hopefully it won't incentivize more solo play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here are a few reasons why i think they are not as popular as other classes<br />
<br />
Because they were added in mop when most people already picked their main instead of being in a earlier expansion like Bc or wrath<br />
They also started at lvl 1 so not many people wanted to level all the way back up to 90 for raiding or pvp<br />
They did not seem as cool as Dk's or DH to a lot of people since they are not a hero class and dont have a lot of the same visual flare</div></div><hr />

I love my monk and will continue to play it. Unfortunately, not everyone wants to be a class that starts at Lvl 1 compared to DK/DH... On top of that, Blizzard is constantly nerfing and buffing monks with every patch, it changes way too often. An example: Monk damage was amazing at the start of the expansion, never mind that the first few bosses of Highmaul had PERFECT items for them... Blizzard proceeded to nerf their damage into the ground anyways, patch after patch after patch.</div></div><hr />

The only thing you are basing what your main will be on is that there will be a new class, and outdated class info from WoD.</div></div><hr />

I saw it with paladins in TBC on horde, I saw it with DKs in WotLK. Should be entertaining to see how many posts hit the forums after Legion goes live with people complaining about how they can't do anything on their DH because fights aren't melee friendly or no one wants a DH because there's too many already.<br />
<br />
I intend to roll a DH (if I should even get the expansion) but I'll stick to my shaman. DH will just be another FotM class that will last maybe a patch before people start to gravitate back to their old mains. Only a lucky few as well as the stubborn will stick with the DH just like they did the DK.</div></div><hr />

Hey warlock for 9 years here. Rogue 2nd class.<br />
They stripped my spec (demonology) to give all the cool stuff to Demon Hunter. Guess what i will leave in the dust? Blizzard wants us to play DH.<br />
Most rogues on the other hand were Illidan wannabes anyway. Now they can be Illidan. <br />
<br />
Why would they keep playing classes Blizzard do not really care about?<br />
<br />
Those last 3 x packs blizz kept giving more and more to hybrids. They can now out dps pures. No point in playing one anymore. Tbh i see druids and co everywhere nowadays. Rogues, Locks, Mages are super rare. Hunters are the exception.</div></div><hr />

Awesome trailer for SC though. I could watch a movie of that for 3 hours straight, just one big battle like that. One day a movie production company will do it. Maybe even call it 180, for 180 minutes of pure battle!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only people who should be worried about there being so many Demon Hunters are the ones who don't play it well so if you aren't up to the challenge of being better than the average player, expect to be replaceable in a pug or asked to reroll in a progression guild. Being better than the average Death Knight back in WotLK was by no means difficult and a lot simply gave up before hitting 80 too so I'm willing to bet the same will apply here.</div></div><hr />

Or finally make an mmo out of Starcraft. That's really the way Blizz can work the MMO line and maintain their success as the top team. WoW has been going strong for a long time but they are obviously struggling with creating new lore and new characters, Starcraft has plenty of both to run with.</div></div><hr />

Don't think you have to worry about that. 7k out of 31k out of only a small portion of the games player base, is nothing.

<br />
Because they were added in mop when most people already picked their main instead of being in a earlier expansion like Bc or wrath<br />
They also started at lvl 1 so not many people wanted to level all the way back up to 90 for raiding or pvp<br />
They did not seem as cool as Dk's or DH to a lot of people since they are not a hero class and dont have a lot of the same visual flare<br />

If Monks had been around in TBC, i'd be maining one. But they weren't, so I went ENH Shaman- because it was closest to a monk.</div></div><hr />

Simply because I have been and will ALWAYS be in love with turning into a partial/full demon. I love warlock demonology spec and went it every chance I could when it could hold its own. I have always had a tank character as my main alt and now I will be able to tank as a demon. <br />
<br />
I won't care about their performance, I will simply enjoy being able to become a demon (hopefully at will). Still need to see how it will be but if I will be able to maintain demon form for a long time the deal is sealed.</div></div><hr />

PS. wrote a whole long list of different variables that would affect my decision process. Decided not to post it. Just going to stick to that more info is required regarding:<br />
<br />
<br />
Class/spec changes<br />
Class/spec performance and flavour<br />
Current not announced Artifact weapons<br />
Profession changes<br />
Other players Class/spec choices<br />
<br />
<br />
For example, many people look to be flocking towards DH mains. DH can only be dps or tanks. That means there are might be a healer deficit. That to me looks like a great chance to main a healer and get a guaranteed raid spot.</div></div><hr />

I know I sure did.<br />
<br />
Regarding the poll, there's no way to know. Not only do I need to play a Demon Hunter first to get a feel for it, I can't compare it to the way my Windwalker Monk plays now, since there will almost certainly be a major revamp to the Monk--and every other class--in Legion. I may be tired of the way my Monk plays now, but who knows, it could be a ton of fun after the revamp. Even if it's not, would I prefer the Demon Hunter over the then-newly revamped Enhancement Shaman? I need to play them to find out.</div></div><hr />

But a lot of that is from completely new game play. The other classes lost appeal, and I've played long enough to know that an expac doesn't change it enough.

All those wanting to main a DH are going to be sorely disappointed when people start saying &quot;LF DPS (no DH)&quot; or guilds refuse to recruit DHs because they have too many already. I saw it with paladins in TBC on horde, I saw it with DKs in WotLK. Should be entertaining to see how many posts hit the forums after Legion goes live with people complaining about how they can't do anything on their DH because fights aren't melee friendly or no one wants a DH because there's too many already.<br />
<br />
I intend to roll a DH (if I should even get the expansion) but I'll stick to my shaman. DH will just be another FotM class that will last maybe a patch before people start to gravitate back to their old mains. Only a lucky few as well as the stubborn will stick with the DH just like they did the DK.<br />
<br />
Even so, think of all the BAD DHs we will see. No guild wants them since most will be new players or players that don't have a main with any kind of progress. Since us who have will stick to what we know but try out the new thing but not switching completely.</div></div><hr />

I remember this happening with Dk's in LK. But people said the same thing would happen with monks, well I didn't see the same thing. IF DH's become OP blizz will just nerf them like they did with monks, then those people that were hoping to get an OP class will go to something else.</div></div><hr />
