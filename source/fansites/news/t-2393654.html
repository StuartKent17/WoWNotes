To clarify, the trainers you will battle for Battle for Azeroth World Quests will scale to the level of the highest level pet on your current pet team, allowing you to complete the World Quest with low-level pets.

To clarify, the trainers you will battle for Battle for Azeroth World Quests will scale to the level of the highest level pet on your current pet team, allowing you to complete the World Quest with low-level pets.<br />
<br />
While we may expand this system to other trainers and battles (a few already use it, like Crysa), we don't plan to expand it to wild pets at this time.<br />
<br />
No plans currently to expand the cap, are you finding that you're out of pet space?<br />
<br />
We're looking into the difficulty of getting the 1500 pets item in a BfA world.<br />
<br />
We’d like to take a moment to discuss Battle Pet philosophies as they pertain to current nerfs, future buffs, and Master Trainers.<br />
<br />
We like adding new Battle Pets in expansion packs with powerful abilities. Along with this, we generally “retire” pets that have seen many days of spotlight in both PvP and PvE. Recently you have seen this with the Bone Serpent and friends. <br />
<br />
By doing so, we hope to keep both the PvE and PvP meta-games fresh, interesting, and involving player-driven strategies. We don’t intend to increase the level cap or rarity of pets, so this approach allows us to update both past and future content, unlocking new strategies for players that intend to collect them all. It’s analogous to Hearthstone moving some cards to Wild – it allows for the new expansion, and its abilities, to shine, without an ever-increasing power level for all pets that ultimately becomes unsustainable.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, this empowers the player that has the largest collection – and this is what Pet Battles is all about. If you have a large stable, you will find that previously-underpowered things bubble up to the surface when other things sink, and your ability to collect them all will ultimately best allow you to weather the storm of change.<br />
<br />
If you find that any older content becomes very difficult as a result of these changes, we’d like to hear from you – new combos should allow you to overcome older challenges, but we have a LOT of Trainers in WoW, so you never know when one may surprise you (or us). <br />

Battleground Updates in Battle for Azeroth<br />
Strand of the Ancients<br />
Strand of the Ancients has been removed in Battle for Azeroth. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20762736077?page=1#5))<br />

Large Battlegrounds - Battle for Azeroth<br />
As of right now Alterac Valley and Isle of Conquest are the only two battlegrounds in the 'large random battleground' list. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20762268094?page=1#2))<br />

Renewing Mist<br />
Thanks for all the followup on Renewing Mist. In an upcoming beta build, we're likely going to try having Renewing Mist automatically try to jump, if you cast a new one that would overwrite it.

Holy Paladin Feedback<br />
We want to keep Beacon of Faith, but also have that row be competitive. Even though we rarely do kiss/curse talents, this is a case where it's worth it to use the % transfer to balance the talent. It's also deceptively strong, because even though it looks like &quot;30% reduction&quot; means you get only 1.4x the usual benefit of Beacon--in reality you often cast on one of the two tanks, get the mana return consolation prize, get any set bonuses or traits that trigger, and still get 70% benefit from the other beacon. Long story short, agreed that the health of that row depends on things being able to compete with Beacon of Faith. Divine Purpose is still something we want to try on that row, as a more all-purpose talent that's not as situation-dependent as all of the Beacon variants.<br />
<br />
Awakening may well need to be stronger. Its tuning should reflect a premium for the fact that it's uncontrolled. It's already buffed from The Topless Tower to try to better account for that; we'll keep an eye on it at least.<br />
<br />
Holy Prism may well need to be stronger also. But, like many talents that add new damage/healing buttons, it's already getting stronger relative to its peers due to the departure of Artifacts. We'll see if that's enough on its new row.<br />
<br />
We like Beacon of Virtue as well! Nothing planned there other than any minor tuning that may arise. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20762188005?page=1#8))<br />

Garrote and Iron Wire<br />
Garrote modified by Iron Wire will have a 5 second duration in PvP in the next build (silence and damage reduction).

As to strand, I didn't dislike nor was it my favorite BG but removal is a bad move imo.<br />
IT's not like we are drowing in BG maps so less choice is bad. And with the split in large and small bgs in Bfa everyone who disliked Sota could just blacklist it.<br />

<br />
Removing the one 40people BG that's exactly the same for both factions, with mechanics so unique. Do people really hate Strand more than Isle of Conquest? I've been playing this shit since it was released and didn't hear anyone complain untill now, as for AV and IoC with the unbalance between factions are always the go-to for the ban. This makes no sense to me.<br />
<br />
Anyway, removing any content is never the answer, you can rework it if it doesnt work, but removing it? Holy shit that's the laziest there can be, I can only think this is a good decision if they're just removing it temporaly cause they broke it trying to rework it or sumthing but wow...can't believe this is happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's kinda strange, since Legion Blizzard rather utilize as much content as they can in end game. It isn't great PVP content, but neither is Ashran and it will be in game at some point. Personally I think they want to rework SotA as &quot;big&quot; battleground and reintroudce it with later patch, just like Wintergrasp, Tol Barad and Ashran.<br />
<br />
This way battlegrounds are split between &quot;meta&quot; ones (that are more or less balanced), casual &quot;big&quot; ones and brawls.</div></div><hr />

You don't have the data to know if those things are universally disliked.<br />
<br />
Trial of the Crusader was fun and the GCD change doesn't bother me one bit. Have you actually played on Alpha/Beta? It's really not game changing.<br />
<br />
Blizzard does have the data to know if certain things are universally disliked. If 95% of the PVP population has Strands blocked, then its removal makes sense.<br />

Jokes aside, the biggest mistake Blizzard made when they implemented vehicles in Battlegrounds was making the vehicles feel weak. Getting in one was a chore, you were taking the job nobody else wanted to do because you felt like a big weak target while operating one. Meanwhile everyone else is fighting and having fun playing their class while you aim and press 1 repeatedly until you blow up.<br />
Look at any other war game, players tend to race to the vehicles and fight over who gets to pilot them.<br />
<br />
And yes, I realize that they're meant to be SIEGE vehicles and aren't meant to attack the enemy players but at the very least some additional abilities like dropping caltrops or throwing slowing oil/tar would break up the tedium and add some strategy to piloting them.</div></div><hr />

It felt gimmicky at first, but it did grew on me over time. More than just pure zerg is always welcome imho</div></div><hr />

SotA was definitely not my most hated BG, so why remove it for people that like it?<br />
Just exclude it from the random bg list but make it still available for direct sign up; where's the problem blizzard? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

That being said why remove it? Why not leave it in for those who enjoy it and don't blacklist it? Personally I love AV, but I usually blacklist it when random queing as I just want to get into some quick matches, not have to endure a possible turtle time waster, it's fun when you have the time for it.</div></div><hr />

This is pretty hyperbolic to say the least. Strand is by FAR the most blacklisted BG, it tops the list of nearly every poll of least favorite BG. The last statistics I saw had 47% of players blacklisting it. They next most blacklisted? AV at 17%.</div></div><hr />

By that same stat though, that would mean 53% of ppl arent blacklisting that map and are fine with playing on it. I can understand it's definitely disliked but it's not even a majority of players at that point. If 80% of players were blacklisting a map i could definitely agree they should move it out of the core pvp rotation, but at least leave it as a seperate queue like Ashran or Wintergrasp.</div></div><hr />

I can totally see your logic there, and I think we both make a good point. Honestly though, If they were to re-tool it I think it could be fine. I have a feeling they will bring it back as a brawl.</div></div><hr />

Very much nonsensical for them to remove SotA. It was actually one of the<br />
most balanced BGs there was.<br />
<br />
Although the vehicles/cannons needed a considerable buff. Cannons did pure<br />
shit damage to not just players but to the vehicles as well. And the vehicles<br />
needed to do a lot more damage to players.</div></div><hr />
