Once a great Highborne city housing some of the most revered night elves of Kalimdor, Vashj'ir was swallowed by the Great Sea in the Sundering and thought to be lost forever. Queen Azshara, formerly a beloved leader of the Highborne, escaped death in the depths of the sea when the Well of Eternity imploded. Such salvation came at a great cost, as the queen and many of her fellow Highborne were forever transformed into the monstrous naga, doomed to wander the seas for thousands of years. Their existence mostly remains a mystery to the peoples of modern Azeroth, though the Earthen Ring has learned of Azshara's naga seizing Vashj'ir for an unknown purpose as the cries of the elements echo across Azeroth from the Abyss.<br />
<br />
The Sunken City<br />
Vashj'ir is a level 78-82 zone in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm where players will be called to explore the depths of the Great Sea and stop the naga from seizing immeasurable power from the realm of Neptulon the Tidehunter. This expansive underwater zone will feature an unprecedented fight for survival against the naga overwhelming the area, several new quest hubs -- including Alliance and Horde naval ships and submarines -- all-new underwater travel and combat mechanics, several pocketed undersea caves free from water's grip, two new five-player dungeons (Throne of the Tides and Abyssal Maw), and the first-ever opportunity to explore the remains of the once-majestic city of Vashj'ir!<br />

Bottled Distress Message Found Adrift at Sea<br />
Need your help. Time is short. I'm held captive in what I hope to be a nightmare.<br />
<br />
Enjoying the ocean air just days ago. We were determined to control key trade routes through victory at sea over the Horde. Their fleet came into our scopes. Our world became the deafening sound of battle, the smell of gunpowder, and the feeling of fear. Looking back now, though, that wasn't real fear.<br />
<br />
We weren't alone in those waters. Our naval warfare attracted attention and rendered us prey. With our vessel already torn apart and taking on water, we saw a tremendous creature rise from the depths and shatter the hull, sucking us down to the sea floor. It all happened so fast. I was quick to tread the waters, hoping to regroup with any survivors I could find through a dense garden of kelp, constantly gasping for a chance breath. That's when the onslaught began. From all directions swarms of brutal naga swept through and captured a great many of us. Beaten near to death, I awoke in agony, bound in chains.<br />
<br />
And here I still sit. I can only describe our prison as very big and somehow very much alive. We're in the hands of the naga now. Surviving crewmates in better condition than me are driven into slave labor.<br />
<br />
One escaped. Thomas. He didn't make it far before I saw him dragged back. Before being forced into labor, he spoke in a panic about some large shell protecting this living prison, expansive night elf ruins in the distance, strange naga rituals underway, and sea vrykul battling our captors. He made little sense. Could be mad. Or I could be mad to hope vrykul are fighting to free us.<br />
<br />
Prison patrols out again. Send word to Stormwind. Sunken city far from extinct. Naga plotting something horrific. Please help. <br />
<br />

<br />
Blizzard's said over and over that they're reworking water mechanics (graphics and physics), and they're introducing lots of swimming mounts. I doubt 'clumsy' will ever be part of the experience of traveling through these zones.<br />
<br />
<br />

I HIGHLY doubt that. Neptulon has always been described as the most evil, destructive one of the Elemental Lieutenants.<br />

No, the point of beta is to test and tweek the mechanics. They don't even know what all of them are yet. There was a lot of &quot;we visualize...&quot; and &quot;we're thinking about&quot; in the class previews. The Paladin preview came right out and said they hadn't really torn into the class yet. Beta is &quot;Oh that ability looks a little OP, let's drop the coefficient&quot; or &quot;Man, that isn't working like we hoped, lets do this instead&quot;, not &quot;Let's throw a half completed class out there and hope some ideas come to us&quot;.</div></div><hr />

That question will be answered for me when I find out how one gets to either of the two zones. With Wrath, I chose Howling Fjord because you got there from a small town (Menethil Harbor) instead of a capital city, so I knew it wouldn't be AS crowded (it was still crowded, make no mistake, but nowhere close to as crazy as Boring Tundra).<br />
<br />
It simply worked out for me that Howling Fjord was also the better of the two zones.</div></div><hr />

No.<br />
<br />
Beta always has been far more than coefficient tweeking (you can't even do that effectively in beta, just not enough time for high end content)<br />
Beta has always been about testing differents implementations of spells. (i.e. the state of Paladin most likely is: which implementations are we going for at the start of beta)</div></div><hr />

Our world became the deafening sound of battle, the smell of gunpowder, and the feeling of fear. Looking back now, though, that wasn't real fear.<br />
<br />
We weren't alone in those waters. Our naval warfare attracted attention and rendered us prey. With our vessel already torn apart and taking on water, we saw a tremendous creature rise from the depths and shatter the hull, sucking us down to the sea floor. It all happened so fast. I was quick to tread the waters, hoping to regroup with any survivors I could find through a dense garden of kelp, constantly gasping for a chance breath. That's when the onslaught began. From all directions swarms of brutal naga swept through and captured a great many of us. Beaten near to death, I awoke in agony, bound in chains.<br />
<br />
And here I still sit. I can only describe our prison as very big and somehow very much alive. We're in the hands of the naga now. Surviving crewmates in better condition than me are driven into slave labor.<br />
<br />
One escaped. Thomas. He didn't make it far before I saw him dragged back. Before being forced into labor, he spoke in a panic about some large shell protecting this living prison, expansive night elf ruins in the distance, strange naga rituals underway, and sea vrykul battling our captors. He made little sense. Could be mad. Or I could be mad to hope vrykul are fighting to free us.<br />
<br />
Prison patrols out again. Send word to Stormwind. Sunken city far from extinct. Naga plotting something horrific. Please help. <br />
<br />
Reading this makes me believe that the zone is heavly Alliance centered.</div></div><hr />

Beta always has been far more than coefficient tweeking (you can't even do that effectively in beta, just not enough time for high end content)<br />
Beta has always been about testing differents implementations of spells. (i.e. the state of Paladin most likely is: which implementations are we going for at the start of beta)<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been wrong before in my life and I may be wrong here, but I don't think they're quite &quot;done&quot; enough for beta. The classes as presented in the previews were distinctly unfinished, and the Paladin's talents were singled out as being more &quot;design intent&quot; than actual meat. I think we're still a few weeks from Beta, maybe as many as four or as few as two, but definitely not tomorrow or next week. We'll see of course, I could wind up eating my words.</div></div><hr />

Here's hoping you're wrong. :)<br />

Looking good. But I am wondering just how underwater stuff will work. <br />
<br />
Underwater gameplay was explained at BlizzCon. Basically, you can get down to the sea floor, and you'll fight as though you're on land, but then you can seamlessly go up and start swimming again. That's the basic idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If WotLK is a guide, they'll release the beta without finishing the classes and limit leveling. At first, it will be all about testing out the new water physics, phasing, quests, and the first 1 or 2 new spells. They'll leave the max-level stuff and major class tuning for the second or third phase.</div></div><hr />

While I wouldn't expect it this weekend either, I do agree that we'll see a friends-and-family-and-press-and-top-guilds alpha build by the end of the month, one with NDAs attached. A full public beta is probably another month or so away, though.<br />
<br />
But yeh, just because they haven't got the new talent trees and stuff working, and haven't even STARTED itemisation yet, doesn't mean we won't see testing start. World-design first, then a few mobs and quests in 1 or 2 zones. Then test. Professions won't be anywhere NEAR done yet, and neither will loot if that's what you're hoping to see (they'll probably roll over some loot tables from old mobs). Instead, it's about trying to find mysterious holes in the terrain that you can fall through, making sure the phasing system works where it's supposed to (hopefully they learned something from the ICC summoning stone...), testing scripted events and that sort of thing. It's not about testing a finished product just yet. Maybe they'll have a couple of instances finished you can test (DM and SFK anyone?)<br />
<br />
As for this particular new zone.... yeh. Water. Hopefully they know what they're doing, I don't want to see a repeat of Occulus/Malygos/Ulduar/ToC5/etc. I'm going to have to get that turtle mount now...</div></div><hr />

maybe i'm the only one that noticed in borean tundra a ton of quests from a naga wanting revenge on the sea vrykul, and there was a naga in a cage being cooked by several sea vrykul? <br />
<br />
these guys just don't forgive and forget, we returned the vrykul heirlooms while questing in Howling Fjord. ::)</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing that Neptulon will be our ally.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know why you'd guess that when it basically spells out that we're going to go aiming for Neptulon's weapon, despite the fact that it's so powerful it shouldn't fall into our hands. Which means Neptulon is going to try to stop us.</div></div><hr />

Because as far as i can tell, they've never done something this big. This is an actual ZONE. Not some stupid 5 minute quest area in some secluded lake.<br />
<br />
<br />
Underwater is underwater, whether it's a quest or a quest zone, simpleton. &quot;But it'll look different when I swim because they're implementing new swimming physics!&quot; <br />
<br />
Exciting ::)<br />

Until Blizzard gets their shit right on land, they should avoid going underwater.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you are on the seafloor your character acts exactly the same as when its on dry land . So that includes :walking , fighting ... and if you want to swim between the &quot;layers&quot;<br />
you can do it really easy *i assume by trying to jump*. And there also so caverns down there that are water free + underwater mounts that are like normal flying ones<br />
(same speed and all)<br />
<br />
Before you jump on my arse as to where do i know all that... i just fucking listen to what they actually said at blizzcon and not just making a list of what to whine! :P<br />

<br />
<br />
You'll be able to move around as if on land. You can then switch to normal swimming mode to go around and get up and over objects/terrain in the way. Sounds pretty cool.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure I read something about a zone specific underwater mount available to everyone at some point maybe after some initial quests and stuff.<br />
<br />
All in all, the new water effects and this stuff, sounds like it's going to be a fresh new experience and a fun zone. Multiple quest hubs, two 5 man dungeons, and a raid instance.</div></div><hr />

Players will be able to swim throughout the zone by jumping but when on the ground it will act similar to the terrestrial zones and players will use special underwater mounts to move around the zone. In the center of the city is the gateway to the Abyssal Maw which will contain two 5-man dungeons.<br />

<br />
Yeah, I'll probably do this.. Which one do I go to first though? Leaning towards going to Mt Hyjal first as underwater questing is usually slower and if you find yourself pulling too much you'll have a hard time escaping as opposed to most &quot;dry land&quot; situations.<br />
<br />
Really hoping they tune underwater mechanics well because as I said, right now underwater questing is a drag :(<br />
