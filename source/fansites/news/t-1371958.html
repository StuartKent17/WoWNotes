Patch 5.4.1 PTR - Build 17513<br />
Build 17513 was deployed to the PTR realms yesterday, with tooltip updates being the only spell changes. <br />
<br />
This patch is a ~3 GB download and combines all of the previous Mists of Pandaria patches into one file. This should allow the launcher to remove all of the old patch files that have built up over the expansion, saving a little bit of disk space and having to go through multiple files to patch assets that changed over the expansion while playing. <br />

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/gb-en.png Next Connected Realms (EU)<br />
The first set (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/276675-connected-realms-updated-24-10/) of EU Connected realms is going live today and it looks like the next batch will be coming next week!<br />
As a part of our ongoing Connected Realms implementation, we will be connecting additional realms as listed below. We don’t have a specific date yet on when these connections will occur, but we’ll provide another update once we do. <br />
<br />
Realm Connections:<br />
<br />
Mug’thol and Dethecus/Theradras<br />
Temple Noir and Naxxramas<br />
Crushridge and Emeriss/Hakkar<br />
Sporeggar and Scarshield Legion<br />
<br />
<br />
We’ll provide updates on the next batch of realm connections as they're available. For more information on Connected Realms, please read the preview blog post here (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10551009).<br />
<br />
<br />
Upcoming Dampening Hotfix<br />
We agree that matches where one team decides they can’t win (usually because they’ve lost a player), and thus decides to play defensively in an attempt to force a tie, don’t really make for fun gameplay. In fact, one of our original goals for 5.4 with The Crowd Chose You was to eliminate that sort of behavior. We’d much prefer matches to end with a winner whenever possible through fair play.<br />
<br />
To that end, we’ll be applying a hotfix that will add one small tie-breaker. After the hotfix, if a match should last for the full 20 minutes, the team with the most players left standing will be awarded the victory. If both teams have an equal number of players alive, the match will still end in a draw (as it does currently).<br />
<br />
We feel that this will continue to encourage players to try to defeat the other team, while discouraging them from dragging the game out hoping for a tie, without any other major impact on player behavior. We’ll give an update to the official hotfix blog when this hotfix goes live.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Connected Realms<br />
I was wondering why are all the realms getting merged PvP ones, both in US and here, without any PvE ones getting merges? Any particular reason for this? <br />
No special reason other than we have to start somewhere. Not to worry though, low pop PvE realms will get some love too soon enough<br />
<br />
Why are low pop realms connected with other low pop realms? it should be a high pop realm with a low pop realm. <br />
We have just begun connecting realms, and many more connections are planned still. Once we are done with the entire process, the population on all connected realms should be quite healthy<br />
<br />
Any plans on connecting full servers with dead ones and moving people over. Or just splitting the server in two, but keeping them connected? Here in Draenor its a mad house. 1000+ queue lines some times, was made to wait for an hour and a half once. <br />
The current high population realms that have queues will remain as they are today, however we are monitoring the situation on those realms. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/276675-connected-realms-updated-24-10/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8427764143?page=7#123))<br />
<br />
Arena Queue Length<br />
Klause is correct -- we were actually just unable to start new Arena matches fast enough. Turns out, you guys really like to PvP.<br />
<br />
We pushed a hotfix last night that should have cleared up the issue and sped up queues significantly. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/277041-why-are-2v2-queues-so-long-right-now/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10311601605?page=1#13))<br />
<br />
LFR Queue Time<br />
In my experience, queue times can vary depending on a few different factors including the time of day and which day of the week it is. I usually end up trying to get my alts through on a Tuesday night, and the queues often seem quite short at that point.<br />
<br />
If time is your main obstacle, you might want to consider getting a group of like-minded guildies or friends together and tackling it on Flex difficulty at a set time each week (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/276933-lfr-queue/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8427084432?page=1#6))<br />

It looks like Reaper of Souls will be bringing back the Mystic that was removed from beta (http://us.battle.net/d3/en/blog/4325959/Systems_Changes-1_19_2012#blog), adding Transmogrification and Enchanting (similar to Reforging in WoW).<br />

We won't miss you. Makes the queue shorter for everyone else.<br />
<br />
And what do you expect Blizzard to say? What could they possibly say to satisfy the instant hatred people give them every time they say anything (or don't say anything - they can't even win that way)? And they are right - queue times vary on the day and time, and if you don't want to queue you should play with friends - either queuing together for LFR or by doing Flex.<br />
<br />
So either stop your qq or actually quit.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, getting something that was nearly impossible for other players to obtain while still keeping a level of exclusivity is the funniest thing I've ever heard. Get your cynicism checked out, it's clearly making you delirious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cynicism? Not so much. Good business move? Probably. Playing on the compulsivity of hardcore collectors? Funny. Do you really think Blizzard isn't doing this to basically sell these pets for $50 a pop instead of $10 that the regular pet store pets go for? The only exclusivity here is if you're willing to shell out or not, because I guarantee, most of us aren't finding 4 people who haven't tried WoW already that still want to. This is just a pet sale disguised as a RAF reward, nothing more. For those of you who are happy to finally have access to these pets, I'm not one to say what is and what isn't a waste of money for you, because I don't know your financial situation, but let's call a spade a spade, this is a pet sale.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">good diu bro</div><div class="date">2013-10-26, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We agree that matches where one team decides they can’t win (usually because they’ve lost a player), and thus decides to play defensively in an attempt to force a tie, don’t really make for fun gameplay. In fact, one of our original goals for 5.4 with The Crowd Chose You was to eliminate that sort of behavior. We’d much prefer matches to end with a winner whenever possible through fair play.<br />
<br />
To that end, we’ll be applying a hotfix that will add one small tie-breaker. After the hotfix, if a match should last for the full 20 minutes, the team with the most players left standing will be awarded the victory. If both teams have an equal number of players alive, the match will still end in a draw (as it does currently).<br />
<br />
We feel that this will continue to encourage players to try to defeat the other team, while discouraging them from dragging the game out hoping for a tie, without any other major impact on player behavior. We’ll give an update to the official hotfix blog when this hotfix goes live.<br />
<br />
So... is damping gone?</div></div><hr />
