Good change, now get rid of the other blanket silences. I play a warrior and this glyph was getting out of hand, this is a very good change.<br />
<br />
Blanket silence is a retarded mechanic, why should you be rewarded with a blanket silence when you've missed your interrupt?<br />

Blanket silence just promotes badplay.</div></div><hr />

Why? Why do you need a blanket silence as a warrior? You have enough lockout as it is, and blanket silences should've never been implemented at all, atleast not for pvp, it's a stupid mechanic.</div></div><hr />

Well I agree 70 was very hard to get, but 60 does seem too easy. Maybe 65 would have been just right. Oh well.</div></div><hr />

Seems to me like they might just be trying to make &quot;Glyph of Enduring Healing Sphere&quot; attractive. Without it, the spheres will not stick around very long. With it, you'll get behavior pretty similar to what you see today.<br />
<br />
(Unless they change that glyph, or I'm misunderstanding how it works.)<br />
<br />
I saw no point in that glyph before, as the spheres already lasted long enough. Now, I see a reason to get it.</div></div><hr />

Because they realized blanket silences are stupid? And before this nerf this glyph was mandatory for pvp?</div></div><hr />

Nah, it's the same skeleton. You can tell just by seeing the horrid angle on the wing and how close the feet are, it's just a new mesh on top of the old animations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From my fiancee, an ornithologist:<br />
&quot;Looks like they gave the gryphon an extra joint in the primaries so they flip up on the upstroke. There are no bones or joints for the primaries. They should move fluidly with the secondaries. The feathers can bend gradually, but the flip on the upstroke is too extreme. It took me watching it a few times, but look at that split (which in itself if wrong) and then watch what the tips of the wings do.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
They could make the new gryphon model have PROPERLY impressive wings, but nooo...stick to the old, fugly animation -_-. I guess we can see that they will do shoddy jobs on all the other model upgrades.<br />
<br />
Also, is it sure that they're updating the flying faction mounts, and not just adding 2 new ones for the Brawler's Guild or something?</div></div><hr />

They're working on character models. They've been saying this since March.<br />
<br />
It's going to take them a lot longer to upgrade all the player models than other model work. Would you rather them not add any new creatures or mounts or models to the game until they finish the player models? Because honestly they might not finish them all for more than a year even if that's the only thing they were working on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard doesn't seem to like abilities that are &quot;pre-pull&quot; unless they're utility like a warlock's portal.<br />
<br />
This change basically makes the spheres something that's only used out of combat or perhaps as an emergency self heal by Windwalkers if the healers are running OOM. <br />
<br />
It's really kind of inconsequential though, individual spheres didn't heal for much anyway. Losing 3 for the course of a fight is unlikely to be the difference between a wipe or not. Unless you're running with a bunch of Monks in a 25 man guild, I doubt you notice this change.</div></div><hr />

They say the same bullshit since 4 years if not more. <br />
<br />
And you're second part is wrong, working for an animation studio, I can tell you that a decent (note that I said decent, not exceptional) can produce a model worth looking at in a movie, not a video game in about a day or two, and to polish it out in about a week with all the player customization options included, ergo about 2-3 months tops to polish all old races to new one with testing and stuff, but we're somehow we're still playing with 50 poly dwarf models and such - a disgrace.<br />
<br />
A year time to finish 10 simple models, lol, yes if I'd work like that, I would have lost my job about one week after I got it, and be living on the street for about 7 years now. <br />

The reason is they are scared as fuck, people will dislike the new models and quit playing when their character gets replaced, however they are to ignorant to include a new models/old models check box in the client, so people can decide themselves.</div></div><hr />

What rear end did you pull that time frame out of? Making models for a movie and for a video game are completely different. So assuming you're telling the truth (which I doubt), you still vastly underestimate the time and effort required to do something like that. Especially when you take into consideration that those same teams are also busy working on more expansion content.</div></div><hr />

They aren't changing the achievements at all, just the tooltips for 55 and 60. They were incorrectly displaying the prerequisite for 55 reps as 60 and 60 reps as 70.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ofc they are , read the achievement change they aren't fixing the tooltip at all, they are altering ther requirement since at the moment there is only 75(if you count black prince) reps you can get exalted ( prolly wrong but a rough count ) which some of those reps aren't obtainable anymore due to being removed.</div></div><hr />

I agree that blanket silences are dumb. Same goes for non-dispellable stuns but hey ho. If they do exist in the game, they should be on a high CD. I think mages should also lose their blanket silence, and I say this as a mage player, or at least have that effect on a higher CD.<br />
<br />
Change to Pyro is still stupid. Change to DF is understandable, at least the CD is the same. This causes less of a nerf to its effective uptime. Strictly speaking, only frost should benefit from a full 5 sec DF as it is the spec that required it to do damage. The other two specs don't need it as much as a stun for some breathing space. I did think Blizzard's decision to give shatter to all specs was a bit ill-advised. RoF CD increase is ok I guess, it'll still be a powerful spell.<br />
<br />
The changes to locks are great. KJ's Cunning is actually a damn good spell now. I am glad they removed the cast-time penalty, when most other casters can cast on the move with less powerful abilities at no cost.</div></div><hr />

All I see is the ears that are also present on the old WoW model (though with this low-res they could be argued to be horns, they're still a completely different shape.).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silverwolf</div><div class="date">2012-10-24, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wyverns have never had horns, it's just some of the newer Blizzard art crew wanting to put they're own mark on things. Frankly I wish they hadn't touched the models, and had simply updated the textures, maybe the armour plating. I LIKED the look of the old faction mounts, don't like these ones at all, won't be using them. <br />
<br />
With the Wyvern, as with many of the models in the game now, they seem to have an obsession with elongating fangs to a ridiculous degree, and the tail looks like it's now a bad Photoshop job, instead of an organic part of the creature. If they had made it more a lions tail tapering to the scorpid tip, and left off the horns, then even with the extra elongation on the fangs it might have looked ok, but as it is... none of my characters will be seen on that mount.<br />
<br />
As to the Gryphon, the older design is far more robust/burly looking, this one looking almost flimsy in comparison, and the new wings look almost like they're a double set thanks to the extra protrusion mid way along the wing, instead of being the single pair of wings. At least I've only got horde toons so only time I'll have to look at this model is when chasing Alliance.</div></div><hr />

I was looking forward to get my last faction to get the 70 Exalted, that does show you aint some part time scrub.<br />

<br />
So there was not any thread i could find about this but I noticed healing sphere a monk spell went from 2 min to 10 sec? I totally thing this is so far beyond trying to make things even and fare. Why does it always seem like you guys take one spell or whatever it is such as the quick and the dead guild perk and totally go way to far with stripping it of its usefulness. WHY even allow us to use it in the first place if your going to be so blatantly unfair and deteriorate these things so badly. Sure lower the CD I play a monk they stay up for a long time. But come on 10 secs. Two things should happen with this spell. Firstly you should increase the radius of its healing ability. Walking over it never mind seeing it on a floor while everyone's spell affects is hard. And up the timer to 30 sec or even 45 second. The healer has to not only decide what the best place to place it is, but then its up to the tanks or dps to use it so its not wasted. lets work on a way to make everyone happy instead of doing what you normally do which is. Oh here is a great useful ability. spell. ie whatever. Then we are going to take away its usefulness and deteriorate it into nothing. Thanks Sincerely I know its seems your against allowing your populous to have fun but come on, because that's the message you give your players when you pull stuff like this.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather not see it in my glyph book everyday angry that my ranged blanket silence was taken away from me. At least let melee kicks lock out for 7 secs like ranged silences, we have to actually be in melee ranged to kick unlike a mage who can just press their button that's off the gcd (heroic throw is on the gcd) without them actually facing their target like gag order needed.</div></div><hr />
