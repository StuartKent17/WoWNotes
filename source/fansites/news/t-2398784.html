Much like Theramore and other instances of this, they added Chromie to the areas. She will be able to phase you into the 1-109 versions of Teldrassil and Undercity if you talk to her about it. Still would like them to do this with Hillsbrad, as that area was pretty awesome prior to cataclysm and Sylvanas nuking all the villages with blight just to test it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as a few months ago, they said that your honor levels on each character will be combined and made into an account level. They may have changed their minds on this, but it is the last known info we have on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Makes me wonder as well. I assumed that prestige would carry on and give weterans like lvl 100 or something from start. Grinding X levels without any rewards sounds...really boring and unrewarding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will carry over. You take the sum of all honor on your account, and that's how much honor your account will start out with.

If they make it harder then they definitely kill PvP. The pacing issue with Legion was that it was too slow.<br />

They need to speed up the pacing to increase participation and they need to add more rewards to maintain current participants.</div></div><hr />

It still feels really bad to have to earn honor levels that grant rewards you already have, or to have to earn more honor to receive rewards than you would have otherwise. It's just a balancing issue in terms of honor -&gt; reward, but they definitely need to fix it.</div></div><hr />

We'll be keeping a fraction of it, Ion's post makes it pretty obvious that being rank 25 =/= being rank 250 in BFA, otherwise he wouldn't need to clarify that we're keeping the rewards if we've earned them.<br />

The rewards will be kept, but anyone who's earned a decent rank is going to have absolutely nothing to look forward to earning over the course of the honor system.</div></div><hr />

Are they seriously issuing the SAME rewards as in Legion for the Prestige System? What in the actual fuck is going on? So I'd have to grind all that honor to reach new Prestige levels before I'd get a reward that I haven't previously earned in Legion? Isn't that really dumb on two fronts?<br />
<br />
One, those rewards could be expansion specific. Adding, y'know, prestige to the fact that we earned them in their respective expansion.<br />
<br />
Two, we have to get rewards that are &quot;Already Known&quot; in a NEW expansion?<br />
<br />
These people are on the crack. Holy shit.<br />
<br />
<br />
My best guess is its because hardly anyone earned them during Legion. I remember a graph a couple months ago showing all the active players's prestige levels. Most of them were 1 or 2, and then after that the number dropped dramatically.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they'll add some new incentives after BFA starts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For one the first prestige level is half the honor of all the others so when they add things together if they kept it at the current scale you would be at 22.5. Now how they will scale things under the new system who knows. Since they mentions people that have unlocked some things will not lose them or have to unlock them again it is safe to assume in your example you would still be at 22.5 with one hell of a mountain to climb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's inexcusable bullshit.<br />
<br />
I should have clarified in my first post----you dont have to grind from 1. They're gonna figure where we start on the 'new' system by figuring out where we are on it from the honor we gained in Legion across all our 110s. If you have all the rewards for example, then that'll probably put you at or past the 150 mark since thats where they list the Midnight Courser being given.<br />
<br />
(It also means I'm jelly of you; I got a late start and just now working through 5 Prestige for the artifact skin at 6. I'm hoping to get the Ivory Courser before BFA but idk).<br />
<br />
I guess it also must mean that if/when they add BFA stuff, that its gotta be after 150, which would put you busy bees in the best position to get it while everyone else is working on getting the Legion stuff.</div></div><hr />

I haven't really gone out of my way to do it except for the rare Sunday I just felt like chaing-running random BGs during extra honor weeks. Also, running as a Mercenary helped quite a bit too with the extra 50% honor. And then of course doing the PvP World Quests whenever they were available. I'm Prestige level 46 because Legion has driven me to 1-2 breaks from raiding because ugh.<br />
<br />
But yeah, that's why I'd be upset. It's taken a good part of the expansion to get here doing it rather lazily. And I don't want to do that again for the same old crap.<br />
<br />
<br />
No prob :) Yeah I'd be pissed too if that were the case---I gotta remember Mercenary mode exists! I main alliance so we usually get the 50% buff for bgs, though I've started working on alts (I unlocked my prot pally and realized the mage tower shield is Gorgeous, so I may try focusing on getting her some legendaries etc) but I also like my tauren sham and get so fed up of long bg ques.

They have spoken about artifact skins directly, and they will be attainable after Legion. Since they're not BfA content though, it doesn't make much sense to list them as main rewards. They'll probably just be tied to your Order Hall and unlocked automatically. In any case, we'll find out before release.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if I am prestige level 1 (50 Honor) does that mean I will automatically get the new rewards that go up to honor level 50 or are Honor Levels just a new name for Prestige Levels which would mean that instead of being 3 prestige levels away from the Prestigeous Bronze Courser (which is my most wanted reward from the prestige system) I would be 9 honor levels away from it?<br />

No one knows; that stuff isn't implemented yet. The scaling will probably be set up in the next couple of builds.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard said the existing ones were being spread out among the new Honor Levels. They didn't say they weren't adding more, and there's a lot of room there for unique items. I'm one of those people that didn't grind out the rewards because I thought PVP in Legion was awful. Besides the fact the item level of the gear was lower than what could be obtained from PVE, it took entirely too long to Prestige. Too much work for too little reward. I'm not big on Arenas, so I mostly did battlegrounds, and that's probably why I hated it. I wish I could find a guild that does Rated Battlegrounds regularly. I'd really enjoy that.</div></div><hr />

The way it was explained to me, is that each honor level is going to require the same amount instead of steadily increasing from 800 to 1000. If you have multiple alts with several prestige levels, you'll be fine. If you've maxed prestige on 2 or more characters you'll also be fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can just unlock the artifact appearances as soon as you reach a certain honor level, just like they do when you meet the requirements for the other artifact appearances. It doesn't have to be listed on the achievement. So yeah, they could very well be sprouting out of your bumhole, if that's how you want to look at it.</div></div><hr />

It seems really counter intuitive for them to have announced the honor/prestige combining (to the joy of many players unhappy with the Legion PVP grind) to then roll it all back with a system like this.<br />
<br />
So if Legion Prestige levels = BFA Honor levels, then someone who made it to Prestige 25 on one character will start at Honor 25 and have to grind 225 more honor levels to reach where they were at the end of Legion? That clearly makes no sense... <br />
<br />
I have to believe that the conversion of prestige to honor would put someone like that at Honor level 250 right from the get go. I would also imagine that to be the case for someone who got a bit higher than Prestige 5 on 5 different characters (since that's roughly the same amount of honor earned as ranking up to 25 on one character).</div></div><hr />

It seems really counter intuitive for them to have announced the honor/prestige combining (to the joy of many players unhappy with the Legion PVP grind) to then roll it all back with a system like this.<br />
<br />
So if Legion Prestige levels = BFA Honor levels, then someone who made it to Prestige 25 on one character will start at Honor 25 and have to grind 225 more honor levels to reach where they were at the end of Legion? That clearly makes no sense... <br />

I highly doubt this, both the conversion to the new system or the 25=250 part. Everyone will probably start fresh at the new level 1 and current 25 is nowhere near new 250. What they meant by keeping the rewards is that you simply keep the rewards. When you reach the level that reward has, nothing happens since you already have it.</div></div><hr />

Maybe... if they're adding rewards for every single honor level and only showing us where the old Legion rewards are on the list. Otherwise, it's a massive kick in the teeth to everyone who PVPed at all in Legion and a great way to ensure that even few people participate in PVP this time around.<br />
<br />
But that still doesn't address the whole combining prestige levels thing. If everyone starts at 1, then what was the point of that earlier announcement?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a bronze dragon NPC next to all of the destroyed zones since Cataclysm (Theramore, Blasted Lands, Peak of Serenity, Silithus, Tirisfal Glades, Darkshore) that lets you switch back to the original pre-destruction phase.</div></div><hr />

No one is starting fresh. Your honor level will be the cumulative of all the characters on your account. What -hasn't- been said is how much honor per level would be in the new system.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathranis</div><div class="date">2018-05-22, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I highly doubt this, both the conversion to the new system or the 25=250 part.

You don't start at level 1. They already announced that all of your current honor across all your characters will be combined to give you your starting Prestige level in the new system.<br />
<br />
Given that the first 250 Prestige levels in the new system roughly correspond to the rewards from the 25 Prestige levels in Legion, and that they'll be taking Prestige all the way up to level 1000, it makes it pretty obvious that most people who grinded through all 25 levels should start at 250+.<br />
<br />
It'll probably be paced out such that the first 250 Prestige Levels take a fair amount less Honor than 250+, giving people who didn't PVP much in Legion a means to start catching up to players who did, and ensuring that people who PvPed extensively across multiple characters won't be that far ahead of the curve.<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason they're saying &quot;if you already got a reward, you'll keep it&quot; is because the distribution for rewards has been shuffled around. For example, Dutiful Squire used to be Prestige 7, but it's going to be Prestige 5 in the new system, while Alliance Enthusiast used to be Prestige 1, but now it's going to be Prestige 20.<br />
<br />
What that means is if you're currently only Prestige 1, you'll keep your Alliance Enthusiast pet even though those rewards are being moved to Prestige 20 in BfA.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to point out that this line is from cata and not new.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naminanu</div><div class="date">2018-05-22, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A while ago it was revealed that in terms of honor, all your characters' prestige levels would be thrown together and that would be your new prestige level in BfA. I have ten characters in total, so I've been doing Broken Isles PVP world quests on most of them so as to up their level and get a nice, high, account-wide prestige level when the expansion hits. However, now it has suddenly been revealed that we will have a whole new honor count, which I don't necessarily grasp; my question is; is it worth it still for me to put my time in and do these world quests now, on all my toons, or should I let it go? <br />
<br />
Right now my main is at prestige level 3, two other toons are at 2, and the rest is at one, all progressing towards prestige level two. With the first announcement, if I'd level all of them one more level, that would put my account wide prestige level at 24, and I'd get pretty much all the rewards. But what is the situation for me now?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

I remember a graph a couple months ago showing all the active players's prestige levels. Most of them were 1 or 2, and then after that the number dropped dramatically.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they'll add some new incentives after BFA starts.<br />
<br />
At that moment, I had Prestige rank 16 which was among of roughly 1% of players listed in the graph. Now I have rank 22 on my main, half a dozen of alts on rank 4 or 5, and a handful around rank 1-2. I aim to get the last mount before July, probably also the last title. Battleground weekly event will surely be helpful.<br />
<br />
Though I wonder how this all will affect my alts, especially the PvP artifact skins. Have not seen anything specific on that.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;...but the pacing isn’t exactly the same.&quot;<br />
That means that I have to farm honor again for rewards which I already got in Legion?<br />
<br />
For me, this looks more like you will have a long &quot;content drought&quot; of prestige levels without any rewards, if you have already earned them in Legion. Or did they fill some levels up with rewards which are not yet in the game?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Metallourlante</div><div class="date">2018-05-22, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have read that each honor level in BfA is roughly 5500 honor points, can anyone confirm or deny it? Or no one knows that for sure and it's too early to tell?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Decyde</div><div class="date">2018-05-22, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm wondering how this will work out as well and if they capped it. I currently have 29 level 110s and 14 are prestige 2, 14 are mid 1 and my main capped 25 back in January which pisses me off how much honor I wasted.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if that would give me an extra 40 prestige worth of honor putting me at 65 prestige worth of honor or if they are going to cap gains per season once again which was annoying.<br />
<br />
Instant world quests alts were great for picking up 500 honor here and there plus I hit up wq's with marks to get all the pvp gear which is why I have so much honor.</div></div><hr />

Damn, my grinding in hopes for just getting all the shit with the aggregation patch might actually be for naught.. I certainly won't grind my ass off under the new warmode system and battle grounds, that was already the worst way to progress in legion and induces suicidal tendencies in most people..</div></div><hr />
