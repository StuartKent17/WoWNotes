Blood Elf Model Preview Tuesday<br />
It looks like the Blood Elf model preview is coming on Tuesday!<br />
<br />

Mission Complete Addon<br />
If you enjoy Breeze (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/breeze) but want to click even less to go through completed missions, the Mission Complete (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/mission-complete) addon will go through all of your missions and complete them as fast as possible, outputting the rewards to chat. A similar feature was also added to Master Plan (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/master-plan) yesterday.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;gallery-mc&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/november/mcaddon.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/november/mcaddon.jpg) &lt;/div&gt;<br />

Class Balance Changes<br />
Blizzard let us know that class balance changes are coming, even for Shaman (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/536960532322844672)!<br />
We're aware that shaman DPS is low and are planning to buff it. (Source (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/536960532322844672))<br />
<br />
Re: class balance - yes, we're planning to make adjustments. Currently gathering data to help us make the right changes. Don't want to under/overdo changes and have to buff/nerf again after.<br />
Honestly hope you aren't just relying on 5ms? Some classes look amazing in 5mans, but won't be margins ahead in raids.<br />
Definitely not. We're looking forward to getting raid data.<br />
PvE or PvP side ?<br />
Both (Source (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/536963726482493442))<br />
Will the changes be prior or after initial progression though? choosing which spec to gear is kinda important.<br />
Depends on what you're considering &quot;initial progression.&quot; Likely to be after Normal raids open. Need that raid data. (Source (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/536964938388873218))<br />
Why do you need that data? You've got MC data, you've got simulations that you guys bragged on at BlizzCon.<br />
A class can have amazing patchwerk DPS and completely suck on raid encounters with actual mechanics. MC data is a tool. Simulations are a tool. We'd like to make use of every tool available. (Source (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/536977013165146112))<br />
<br />
Now I have another question: are you saying that because you actually got updates on it or is it just to quell us?<br />
They're still in testing and not yet ready to be communicated. Class tuning changes will only be included as a whole package after being tested. Posting half of it will invariably cause unneeded distress. Check back tomorrow. (Source (https://twitter.com/Rygarius/status/537069300180594688))<br />

<br />
Patch 6.0.3 Hotfixes - November 24<br />
World Environment<br />
<br />
[Requires a realm restart.] The time that corpses persist in the world has been restored back to their former durations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons, Raids, and Scenarios<br />
<br />
Dungeons<br />
<br />
[Requires a realm restart.] Resolved an issue where players were unable to queue through Dungeon Finder while in Warspear or Stormshield.<br />
Upper Blackrock Spire<br />
<br />
During the Commander Tharbek encounter, Black Iron Guards no longer join in the fight when he is at 10% health.<br />
Commander Tharbek should no longer be using Iron Axe, Imbued Iron Axe, and Iron Reaver within 4 seconds of each other.<br />
Orebender Gor'ashan's Electric Pulse should now correctly hit players that are standing on a Rune Conduit.<br />
Son of the Beast's Fiery Trail should no longer persist and continue to damaging pets after being defeated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Miner's Coffee (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118897-miners-coffee) should no longer be incorrectly applying its speed buff outside of the Garrison's mine.<br />
Swapblaster (http://www.wowdb.com/items/111820-swapblaster) should no longer be incorrectly swapping locations with targets other than another party member.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enchanting - Lack of Draenic Dust<br />
Please fix this profession. It is the only building in my garrison that sits with zero work being done. <br />
<br />
Dust is far too rare, and much to valuable to use on work orders, when the daily cool downs are so important.<br />
As a personal anecdote, my character's Enchanter's Study is experiencing a similar issue with a lack of work orders submitted when the other buildings are humming along with a constant stream of work orders. We feel that Enchanting Dust can be a bit too scarce to come by and are looking at ways to ease those supply concerns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
81,000 Honor Points farmed and not a single Warforged Dagger are they even real? People have them...<br />
Very rare (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/536276964882272256))<br />
<br />

<br />
Alchemy is a different case than enchanting, I think. What you're describing is the herbalists' job, while with enchanting there's no other profession that can give you the dust you need.</div></div><hr />

As a Jewelcrafter / Alchemist it is nice to be able to have access to both mats and not need to worry about leveling or changing to another toon just so I can get the mats I need for those professions..<br />
<br />
Was always a pain swapping toons just to farm mats for your main toons professions..<br />
<br />
Or is it that you are just mad that you can't sell your ore on the AH anymore..<br />

<br />
The thing is I don't sell gems of flasks, I keep what I make for myself and my guildies.. And well in MoP I stopped posting gems and flasks on the AH because the undercutting got ridiculous.. And well at that time it was easy making gold by other means and with this xpac that will be true again months from now..<br />
<br />
I have a miner as well and during Cata and MoP is was hard to sell ore because just about everyone had a mining toon.. Now yeah this will tick some folks off who all they do is farm gold but things change and we all will have to get used to it.. <br />
<br />
What is good about this way is that they are allowing people to gain access to ores / herbs and what not without the need to jump on their mining / herbalist or what ever toon just to farm mats they need to make something..</div></div><hr />
