Patch 7.3.5 - Artifact Weapon Ending 
During Blizzcon, Blizzard hinted that our artifact weapons were going to get a proper send-off and not continue into the next expansion. We have been able to find hints of just how this will play out. The following dialogue contains spoilers!

Patch 7.3.5 - Artifact Weapon Ending<br />
During Blizzcon, Blizzard hinted that our artifact weapons were going to get a proper send-off and not continue into the next expansion. We have been able to find hints of just how this will play out. The following dialogue contains spoilers!<br />
<br />
Magni Bronzebeard: The sword of Sargeras is poisonin' the very lifeblood of the world. The only vessels capable o' containin' that kind o' power... are the mighty weapons you wield. Raise them up as one.... draw out the corruption from the Dark Titan's blade! Together, champions! For Azeroth!<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.3.5 - The Nighthold<br />
The uninstanced version of the Nighthold (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/8025-the-nighthold) has seen some changes on the PTR, becoming more of a small faction hub. Both Alliance and Horde can visit as of now. There are teleport stations that lead to Dalaran (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/7502-dalaran) and Orgrimmar (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/1637-orgrimmar) usable by the Horde as well as all of your favorite characters from the Suramar campaign, such as Thalyssra (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/98312-first-arcanist-thalyssra) and Theryn (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/104618-theryn). Pandaren monks have also arrived to teach the Nightborne the ways of the http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk class.<br />

Patch 7.3.5 -Thunder Totem<br />
While most of the Bloodtotem tribe became corrupted by the Legion, the few who did not have now sought refuge at Thunder Totem (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/7731-thunder-totem). On top of this, Pandaren monks have arrived to teach the Highmountain Tauren the ways of the http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk class.<br />

<br />
Patch 7.3.5 - Antorus Instanced Vindicaar<br />
Not much is changed between the raid instance version of the Vindicaar and the one you visit daily. All of the champions involved in the campaign (except Illidan (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/127051-illidan-stormrage)) are now standing together and have new dialogue to address their thoughts now that the Legion is finally defeated. There is also a fully functional Netherlight Crucible that can be teleported to and used during the raid once you can skip to Argus and defeat him first. The skybox has also been updated to show the vastness of space and some void infected planets.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Patch 7.3.5 - New Command Boards<br />
The command boards in Orgrimmar (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/1637-orgrimmar) and Stormwind (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/1519-stormwind-city) have received visual upgrades on top of a new UI. They use the same menu now that we used to choose our artifact weapons to pursue and your options change as you level up. You also get a small picture and a brief description of the zone and what the story will contain.<br />
<br />

Patch 7.3.5 - Silithus<br />
The area around the sword in Silithus has also been changed. Azerite nodes have appeared, Horde and Allinace areas have been added, and the ground is no longer red.<br />

<br />
It is definitely a weird way to get rid of them.<br />
Doesn't help that that a lot of the weapons just do no make sense to have this kind of &quot;power&quot; (even with the billions of AP we've crammed into it) to disinfect this kind of wound. Some of the weapons may even do more harm than good (Shadow priest, Affl warlock).</div></div><hr />

It really was the way everyone figured though, number one reason on here was &quot;cleanse the wound&quot;. What makes it lame is everyone already knew, they just didn't want to say because secrets or whatever.</div></div><hr />

Ideally <br />
1. Argus the Unmaker should have been stronger<br />
2. We sacrifice our weapons in an all out attack that kills him<br />
3. Our weapons are destroyed<br />
4. Sarg would have just stabbed the planet, not leaving his sword behind<br />
5. We go back to Azeroth to fight for the lifeblood of the planet, the plot of BFA (Druids and Shamans begin to seal the wound)<br />
6. Upon returning to Azeroth we have the greatest weapon smiths build us temporary weapons for the battle to come<br />
7. Upon arriving to Zandalar/Kul Tiras we get questing greens/blues and so on, the old weapon system.</div></div><hr />

I know the garrison gold making was nerfed because you actually never had to leave your garrison if you set it up properly. However the gold from an order hall can be significant but it takes a decent amount of work to set up. I mainly want to find out if it is going to get nerfed into the ground or if it will remain viable going forward, along with the rogue pick pocket weekly.</div></div><hr />

Yeahh....pity about Azeroth, but me and my Artifact Weapon just decided Alternate Draenor is looking like a good home these days.<br />

1. Argus the Unmaker should have been stronger<br />
2. We sacrifice our weapons in an all out attack that kills him<br />
3. Our weapons are destroyed<br />
4. Sarg would have just stabbed the planet, not leaving his sword behind<br />
5. We go back to Azeroth to fight for the lifeblood of the planet, the plot of BFA (Druids and Shamans begin to seal the wound)<br />
6. Upon returning to Azeroth we have the greatest weapon smiths build us temporary weapons for the battle to come<br />
7. Upon arriving to Zandalar/Kul Tiras we get questing greens/blues and so on, the old weapon system.<br />
<br />
and that doesn't sound lame to you? because it sounds lame to me.<br />
<br />
These weapons were crafted at different times for different purposes throughout the history of Azeroth. It makes little sense that we would need to &quot;sacrifice&quot; them all unless they were specifically tied to the titans in some way. That is of course assuming that ANY needed to be sacrificed for his &quot;defeat&quot;.<br />
<br />
It would also be super lame, that we get some &quot;temporary weapons&quot; after we defeat Argus, or worse that we &quot;sacrifice&quot; them and then get to keep them for the remainder of the xpac until an alternative/replacement is provided.<br />
<br />
Also when do we exchange weapons? After we personally defeat him? After a world first?<br />
<br />
My point to all of this, is it doesn't really matter what device you use... they all are pretty poor options, and made for poor design from the beginning, the issues people had with them back in beta are now coming to fruition.</div></div><hr />

It appears from what I've read that these &quot;allies&quot; aren't fully joining the Alliance or Horde like a &quot;member&quot; race such as Dwarf or Tauren. They entire race is remaining ostensibly neutral but allowing either the Horde or the Alliance to recruit their citizens through an embassy type system.

So, after the first time you kill Argus, you give up your artifact? There's practically 12 months between the time you kill Argus to when the expansion will even release. Just gonna punch things to death until then?<br />

it be nice if they gave us our weapons as BoA (just without the AP and what not) or even reset everything (as well as rework the artifacts.. kinda like artifact 2.0) and let us use it in BFA .. but i know lots of us HATED the way they work.. only thing i really like and will miss is the fact they removed EVERY Weapon in legion (you now what i mean)... guess its back to compairing weapons and bla bla bla</div></div><hr />

I would have loved if they introduced a weapon forging system that allowed us to make a weapon and give us random skins to pick for the &quot;unlocking&quot; like the Artifact skins. I think they nailed it in Legion, because lets be real, weapons will just be BiS picks now, which is boring. At least with the rune system you had to balance the effect, + the Shadowforge tree, + itemlevel into the equation. It's felt like a proper risk vs reward choice. Now it's just going to be back to the old, I'm running this dungeon 16 times for the mace that drops because it's near BiS for me until we talk about Mythic raid xyz...</div></div><hr />

They'll remove the gold missions from the class hall, same as they did with the garrison when 7.0 went live. It's been a given since even before Legion's release and why I've been running hard the class hall on all my characters from the outset of the expansion.<br />

We should have sacrificed them to create Sargeras's prison, IMO. Much more satisfying to use them to defeat the final boss than to absorb the corruption from his sword.<br />

Personally I'm hoping they keep them relevant somehow. Would be nice if they gave all the classes their Order Hall teleports from the 7.0 PTR back, and give you maybe a weekly quest or something to complete X number of world quests or something for some minor reward. After they put so much effort into giving each class its own hall, it would be a real waste if we never had a reason to go back to them again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No I think any device that causes ALL of us to give them up is pretty lame. As noted later in this thread they were crafted at very different times, for very different reasons and it makes zero sense that ALL of us would need to &quot;give them up&quot; or &quot;sacrifice them&quot; unless they were somehow tied to the titan himself.<br />
<br />
Essentially ANY scenario in which we ditch some of the most powerful artifacts this world has ever seen... is stupid. Concerns that were raised back when Legion was originally announced given that it was also made known shorty after that our possession of such artifacts would be finite.<br />
<br />
Personally, I find the only plausible scenario, is that the artifacts are housed in our class halls for future heroes, should THE threat or worse threats present themselves.</div></div><hr />

So what about the 50+ times I'm going to kill Argus in between now and then?<br />

There's a cinematic that takes my weapon away, and upon returning to Dalaran... it's magically equipped again? Until BFA?<br />

<br />
<br />
Using our Artifact to &quot;destroy&quot; the weapon of a TITAN, is indeed way better, soaking the pool is lame af, but using all the power within our artifact to cockblock the sword of Sargeras is way better, we can even have to right Legion&gt;BFA passage<br />
<br />
<br />
1. We drain all the power from the artifact<br />
2. Use the power to destroy the sword/heal the wound of Azeroth/soak the &quot;poison&quot; --- hence we counter a Titan power and heal a Titan way better.<br />
3. We can &quot;downgrade&quot; our artifact to Epic quality after the 7.3.5 so we can shift do BfA<br />
4. At some point after 7.3.5 we give back the artifact***<br />
<br />
<br />
*** Ofc to be precise, every artifact MUST HAVE A DIFFERENT SIDE QUEST<br />
<br />
1. Windrunner Bow -&gt; Alleria or Sylvanas (depends on the faction)<br />
2. Ashbringer -&gt; tuck into Tirion tomb beneath Light Hope Chapel<br />
3. Knaifu -&gt; Kept in the Netherlight or &quot;lost&quot; <br />
<br />
etc etc<br />

<br />
There's a cinematic that takes my weapon away, and upon returning to Dalaran... it's magically equipped again? Until BFA?<br />
<br />
I'm of the mindset that there's NO way they could have done this well. But this idea has a pretty big hole in it.<br />
<br />
What if I never do the Antorus raid? Do I keep my artifact forever? Doing it during the next expansion lead in was the only way to plausibly do it in a way that makes sense since everybody has to participate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that's my point.<br />
<br />
Sending it off into Sargy's sword during the pre-expac event is the only way. Story-wise, however, I agree it would have made PLENTY of sense for us to have to use our incredibly powerful artifact weapons to subdue an otherwise undefeatable enemy Titan. I could digest that in my mind, and reason that it makes sense.<br />
<br />
But this sword thing? Meh. It is what it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, I feel like there should be a quest for each artifact. They have their own story and what would make this lame is just throwing them away without any acknowledgement of where or who they came from.<br />
<br />

Instead of making a proper quest - similar to how we got the weapon - we now get a simple &quot;raise it and do this&quot; ... ok, but what about the weapons that are made to corrupt (shadow priests), or plain made to absorb these things in the first place (quite a few of them are made that way). So in this one case I´d say it is lazy work from developers side.<br />
<br />
At the very least they should have something that just said &quot;the war is over you don´t have need of the weapon any more, so set it aside for now&quot;.<br />

Yes, can you imagine what the shadow priest weapon would be like ... &quot;ok, so I have been able to switch to another person to mess up their fates. But now I´m just being destroyed this way?&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Weapons like the Ashbringer and Doomhammer are symbols of lore. Other weapons are actual characters that deserve more depth given. <br />

<br />
No weapons, due to artifact removal, no more quests giving you Artifact power. ?????<br />
<br />
Will Blizz redesign all quest rewards, world quests and 75% of Legion content due to artifact removal? <br />
<br />
Or will our alts still get artifacts for &quot;some hours&quot; until we reach lvl. 110?<br />
<br />
What will happen to Class Halls? Nearly all quests there (and vast majority of usual quests) are giving you Artifact Power and gold which will get nerfed!</div></div><hr />

1.) The only tint that is unlocked account-wide is the one that requires This Side Up (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10602-this-side-up). Everything else is per character.<br />

They weren't really THAT important to anything but HISTORY...until we started jamming things on them called &quot;Treasure of the Ages&quot; and &quot;Glory of the Order&quot; and so forth. Before you think negatively on the sort of generic nature of those token names...remember that most power on Azeroth comes from somewhere else. That is, You get power from &quot;The Light&quot; or &quot;The Void&quot; or &quot;Nature&quot; or &quot;The Elements&quot;. But what is this wacky GENERIC power that seems to be loosely tied to either STRONG EMOTION or COMMUNITY (or both!). That power is unique, and isn't found elsewhere in the Universe. I'd argue that it's exactly what Azeroth's power IS. The ability to make people form communities due to strong emotional connections. And our weapons have been PRIMED with that power. And now the SOURCE of that power needs us to draw a poison from a wound.<br />
<br />
If Sargaras's intent was to poison Azeroth by tuning his weapon to seek out and kill HER POWER, WHAT BETTER TRAP THAN OUR WEAPONS? Especially since we offer them freely, while Azeroth would be trying her best to withdraw from the poison. <br />
<br />
We have filled our weapons up with RAW AZEROTH-POWER. And Sargaras' weapon aims to kill that power. Naturally it makes sense that if we touch our artifacts to his sword, it's going to devour our AP...because AP IS AZEROTH'S OWN MAGIC.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karamaru</div><div class="date">2018-01-14, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am curious though, so what happens if we take the Dark Portal to Alternate Draenor and then fashion a ship and fly to alternate Azeroth?<br />
<br />
Then we would arrive on a Azeroth that has had no influence from the orcish horde invasion wich would be an intresting adventure.<br />
<br />
<br />
On topic: I find it really weird that as a Warlock's fel powered weapon would stop Sargs sword from killing Azeroth I cant imagine Thal'kiel sacrificing himself to save Azeroth or Xal'atath deciding that this is the perfect time to ditch the shadow priest.<br />
Another thing would be I dont relish the thought of wielding some pirate or troll's discarded crap after wielding the effing staff of sargeras ect.</div></div><hr />

No much of a &quot;hero of Azeroth&quot; are you. Keeping hold of your artifact for purely selfish reasons? Damning the population of the world? Why did you fight in the first place?<br />
