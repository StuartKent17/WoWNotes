The latest build added some more of the Order Hall garrison style system. Keep in mind that this system is still a work in progress. <br />
<br />
<br />
Quests were added that point you to the new mission table, such as The Champion's Call (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/42126-the-champions-call-wip) and The Fight Begins (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/40795-the-fight-begins)<br />
You can see the Legion missions (such as Yes, We Take Candle (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/missions/852-yes-we-take-candle)) on the WoWDB Beta site (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/missions?filter-lvl-min=196).<br />

Followers still have a specialization, abilities that counter threats, and equipment slots. <br />
Followers can be assigned to zones and give you buffs, such as Odyns Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/210935-odyns-wrath).<br />
Some may occasionally join you in combat, such as Lord Maxwell Tyrosus (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/followers/480-lord-maxwell-tyrosus) with Devout Protection (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/187202-devout-protection).<br />
The latest build added Order Hall Equipment [PH] (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/137236-order-hall-equipment-ph) and new versions of the armor upgrade items (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/consumables/other?filter-build=21063&amp;filter-search=armor).<br />

Librarian Shin (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/137251-librarian-shin) - Librarian Shini will arrive in your Order Hall and grant you the ability to being performing research into your Order Hall Talent Tree<br />
There are Order Hall talents that require time to research, as well as gold or a currency (such as Order Resources (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources)).<br />
Several placeholder Troops were added (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/consumables/other?filter-build=21063&amp;filter-search=troop).<br />

Legion - Crashes on Ability Use<br />
Hey everyone,<br />
Wanted to give a brief update to let you all know that we're well aware of class abilities and spell rotations causing critical error crashes. The problem has been identified and a fix should be on it's way to you all in the next few hours. Thanks Alpha friends for all of the reports!<br />
<br />
Good news everyone!<br />
<br />
We just deployed a binary hotfix to resolve the crashes. Your Battle.net app should pick up the change as soon as you close Legion. As always, thanks for your patience!<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion - Mac Clients Not Launching<br />
Hey everyone,<br />
Looks like an old bug has made it's way into the Alpha and we're actively investigating solutions for our friends on Mac. It's probably going to require a little bit of patching so there's no ETA yet. Thanks all, and as always, we appreciate your patience and diligent reporting.<br />
<br />
With the latest binary deploy, Mac users should be good to go. The Battle.net app should automatically apply the fix. Thanks for your patience everyone!<br />

FEEDBACK: Maw of Souls (Normal)<br />
Please use this thread to post any feedback on the Maw of Souls dungeon. When posting, please note your group composition and any relevant information about the nature of your group (e.g. random LFG group, Mythic raider guildmates, etc.). At this stage, a lot of overall combat balance is in flux, but we're still very interested in hearing overall feedback and impressions of the experience and mechanics.<br />

Do you guys deliberately design classes to have significantly higher AoE or single target DPS than others?<br />
How a spec AoEs is a major part of its identity. Different methods of AoE can be better or worse in different situations. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/695690871061159937))<br />

Hello, I'm slightly confused about something. Fel is called a substance and Sargeras is the God of Fel per UVG. So, Fel belongs<br />
Fel is the primal force of chaos. It can pool into a green goop when it's in physical form. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/695407155680182272))<br />

https://t.co/0WGCX7nuOo will there be more peaceful story to Warcraft? Garrosh is dead, let faction war die with him. FOR AZEROTH<br />

Make-A-Wish® Charity Pet: Thank You!<br />
Thanks to the incredible out-purr-ing of generosity from World of Warcraft players around the globe who purchased Brightpaw the Mana Kitty, we’ve raised more than $1.7 million to benefit Make-A-Wish®, helping them grant the wishes of children throughout the world with life-threatening medical conditions.<br />
<br />
Last year, we announced that during the month of December, 100% of Brightpaw’s purchase price would be donated to Make-A-Wish—and the WoW community rose to the occasion to lend their support. Thanks again for helping to make a difference in the lives of children.<br />
For more information about Make-A-Wish in the U.S., visit wish.org (http://wish.org/), and outside of the U.S., visit worldwish.org (http://www.worldwish.org/). <br />

<br />
Similar structure but it won't be a gold farm or ruin the materials market. Instead of sending random followers to complete missions and collect rewards from the fruits of their labor, they simply act as scouts for point of interest where you and the follower still have to do them... or at least that's what I got from it though. Could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the ones they have added so far, sure. I think at Blizzcon they mentioned unlocks will come from lots of game activities, so raids and PvP are almost guaranteed to be the requirement for some of the variations.</div></div><hr />

From what I understand, it's more like the Shado-Pan in Townlong Steppes dailies; they accompany you.<br />
Could be wrong, though. We haven't seen anything to dictate either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure they said something about some skins comming from rated PvP, or the new system I guess, and some from more &quot;hardcore&quot; PvE like raiding etc.<br />
<br />
I just hope we can get skins from many different aspects of the games, opens up more options to even do PvP (I kinda hate it, unless the PvP gear looks cool, then I've done it from transmog)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they said there would be unlocks for all sorts of things, doing quests getting achievements, PVP, so I wouldn't be surprised if there was one unlocked via raiding</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the looks of it, the followers and missions are like what we have now with WoD that requires said amount of time and Garrison/Class order resources. If that is the case they can stick this game where the sun doesn't shine, since this will be more gated content. Blizzard doesn't seem to understand that no matter how they sugarcoat it a turd is still a turd. Also from watching streams it seems the AI on class order followers are so dumb as well, half the time they just stand there when in combat in the open world.<br />
<br />
They have tried and it failed big time, it's time to give up on it and move on. Blizzard doesn't see that no one likes this follower system ( apart from a few ). If you want a real follower system go look at SW:ToR for how it's really done.</div></div><hr />

AI is hard, even Bethesda has a lot of issues with theirs - Dogmeat is a pain in the ass for triggering traps and getting underfoot, and running off after monsters 3 blocks away.<br />
<br />
I just dislike the whole &quot;follower&quot; mentality anyway - they've replaced group quests with them. Plus, you're distracted watching for your follower. I learned how really annoying that is multi boxing, it turned me off of followers for good - I even park Dogmeat in Fallout 4, because him getting almost killed and whining and limping around is too distracting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coconut</div><div class="date">2016-02-12, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A bit reserved about separate colors as well. If the grindier ones are account-wide, then it's fine, but I'd like some freedom in customizing the looks on my alts without too big of a time sink, unless we're talking about CM or other skill-based rewards, ofc.<br />
<br />
It doesn't help that they seem random achievements that aren't necessarily linked to that artifact color or model (such as the reputation one).<br />
<br />
Would be interesting if there were ways to unlock rows and columns separately...

<br />
It doesn't help that they seem random achievements that aren't necessarily linked to that artifact color or model (such as the reputation one).<br />

Would be interesting if there were ways to unlock rows and columns separately...

<br />
I'd rather see something along the lines of choosing one of X choices for completing a task, then when you do another task you can unlock one of the others, etc. Like if you completed heroic raid, you can choose between 2 options, and in order to get the other option you need to complete a certain rating in pvp.</div></div><hr />

I do not have an issue with factions, but there needs to be some natural waxing and waning of the tensions instead of this constant excuse to go to war over and over at the start of each expansion. Big Bad brings everyone together like Bigger Jaws and everyone starts trusting. A faction leader does something aggressive out of personal emotional issues- WAR! I believe THAT is the biggest turn off for most customers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the beginning we were told that garrison followers would be able to go out and do mundane task for you, which was quickly changed. Then garrison followers were a mix bag of useful helpers to get better yield from crafting dailies to massively over powered for getting the biweekly cache that was one level above your current progression. This cache system made it very easy for a sub par raider to get gear they would have never seen and then take a spot from someone with horrible luck. Next comes the nerfbat and you have to get 11 kills on your current tier to get that cache, which works much better. But instead now we are getting the treasure hunter followers that are insanely OP. So instead of throttle that back we get hit with another massive nerf and are left with the current version. Garrisons have caused an almost unrepairable inflation to the games economy that will have reprecusions for months if not years.</div></div><hr />

Can they just make it entirely optional? Like bring back individual NPC reputations, and make it so you can become best buddies with some NPC, not for any benefit, just for sake of immersion and extra dialogue/lore development for people who like that stuff (me!!). I didn't like the whole &quot;Commander Simulator&quot; thing, I already don't like that I'm the leader of the class hall. But I can give that a pass if it just means I get a fancy weapon over some major lore character. I won't like it if it means I have to start ordering people around again. If I'm the big dick in the class hall can't I just order someone else to manage that while I swing my shiny new weapon around?<br />
<br />
If they're going to implement any sort of remnant of the garrison system, they should implement it in the way it was originally planned. COMPLETELY OPTIONAL</div></div><hr />

It wasn't a bad idea. What was bad, was the lack of any other kind of content. I think going regularly back to your garrison to manage your stuff was a nice break from all the adventuring. Because no matter how many cutscenes and lore and other stuff we put on them qwuests in MMOs all just boil down to gathering stuff or killing stuff, and that can get tiresome. The problems begin when all other content runs out and you are left with garrisons and daily quests.<br />
<br />
Will adventure mode and the new profession stuff give us enough to do? We shall see. But if Legion fails like WoD. It will be because of the content that isn't there, not the content that is.</div></div><hr />

Half the stuff they said in that update sounds exactly like the garbage you get in Garrisons. How can you read..<br />
<br />
Quests were added that point you to the new mission table, such as The Champion's Call and The Fight Begins<br />
You can see the Legion missions (such as Yes, We Take Candle) on the WoWDB Beta site.<br />
You can see the Level 110 Followers (such as Vanessa VanCleef) on the WoWDB Beta site.<br />
Followers still have a specialization, abilities that counter threats, and equipment slots.<br />
Followers can be assigned to zones and give you buffs, such as Odyns Wrath.<br />
Some may occasionally join you in combat, such as Lord Maxwell Tyrosus with Devout Protection.<br />
The latest build added Order Hall Equipment [PH] and new versions of the armor upgrade items.<br />
Recruiter Tianji - Recruiter Tianji will arrive in your Order Hall and you will gain the ability to recruit Ox Inititates for your Class Order Hall<br />
Librarian Shin - Librarian Shini will arrive in your Order Hall and grant you the ability to being performing research into your Order Hall Talent Tree<br />
There are Order Hall talents that require time to research, as well as gold or a currency (such as Order Resources).<br />

I don't believe your optimism. In fact I call bullshit. Just entertaining the very idea of bringing in a universally disliked/over implemented feature shows one thing: They gave not even two shits about player feedback. You still do missions and still collect followers. Even if its only in 1/10th of Legion that is too much.<br />
<br />
Followers need to go away. Forever. Making even one mission that some other NPC does for you is a waste of resources that could be put towards gameplay a PLAYER can do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said, I believe right after the Legion reveal, that aspects of the Garrison would go into Legion. Nobody really paid attention to that comment, but I did, because I knew what it could mean. <br />
<br />
They spent a LOT of time during WOD saying they didn't like the old way of doing things, like dailies and quests, and Garrisons were superior to that. No way they go back on their statements and go back to old style content, they're doubling down on the Garrison tech, to save face. <br />
<br />
Farm/Garrison/Class Hall. The expansion after legion will have something similar. <br />
<br />
Farm: daily quests, you could pick and choose, and go do them. 100% optional.<br />
Garrison: daily quests, you could pick and choose them, but your &quot;followers&quot; do the actual quests. Technically optional, but so much of the content of WoD is wrapped up in them, it's hard to play WoD without them. <br />
Class Hall: daily quests, the &quot;followers&quot; &quot;find&quot; them for you, you do the actual quest. Non-optional, as all weapon drops have been removed, and as I understand it, your only weapon, your Artifact, is wrapped up in the Class Hall. <br />
<br />
One of the biggest complaints I saw over garrisons was that our followers did the quests we wanted to do - looks like Class Halls are exactly that - garrisons where you do the quests. <br />
<br />
I'm not planning on buying Legion, so I don't really care, but that's what I see - and I'l state up front I haven't paid a whole lot of attention to the Alpha. Looks to me that Class Halls are an evolution of the Garrison, they intend for you to spend all of your time not in an instance there, and it's really just more of the same, in terms of mentality and actual gameplay. It's the kind of overall design decision that made me realize WoW was not a game I'm interested in playing anymore.</div></div><hr />

Brand new feature - send your follower into raids instead of participating at your own. Get your epics mailed to you (we dumbed down the game system so a simple AI can push the button for you). Minimum time invest maximum gain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't have to be hard.<br />
<br />
AI comes down to how you design to have it interact with the environment. <br />
<br />
I would make it so that, when you hit something, the AI is declared a target that it is supposed to attack. Combine that with some form of configuration, like ; Be defensive (Will only hit targets if they hit you and you hit them back), Be Aggressive (Will attack anything in the area) etc.<br />
<br />
As for self-preservation in form of knowing the environment ; That can be hard. Because the AI cannot judge what is dangerous situations and not ; i mean, you could probably hammer the code to make it so that it runs a loop to detect &quot;dangers&quot; (Environment hazards such as traps etc.) And steers clear of them, i suppose.<br />
<br />
But that does not apply to WoW, really, all the AI has to care for, is how it interacts with things the player attacks and what attacks the player.<br />
<br />
The ai is not meant to go rampant and slaughter everything, as it is not that powerful to begin with. So, it will most likely just aggro shit and kill you, if they do it that way.<br />
<br />
Also, OT:<br />
<br />
I really, really, really cringed when i saw the Extra Legendary slot from Class Hall.<br />
<br />
Skins, story - optional content, love it.<br />
<br />
Allow us to equip a second legendary with MAJOR gameplay implications, that is only obtainable through the class hall?<br />
<br />
GARRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONS!!!<br />
<br />
To be fair, what makes me the most salty, is that they implied that there would be no gate, more like a soft-cap to how many dungeons you run and how much stuff you do to gain artifact power.<br />
<br />
I DON'T want to sit in that bloody farmville screen again and send back my followers on some Dice roll to see if i get the right Raid gear or not. That just, took me out of the loop. Completely.<br />
<br />
I like the sensation of rolling for an item when i've slain a boss, i've downed something with my team - We did an effort and we reaped the rewards!<br />
<br />
But i mean, a screen with no input, no difficulty, no failure, only a dice roll after X amount of hours, and the pay-off is potentionally Raid gear?<br />
<br />
No, just, no. Go back and really think hard, about what &quot;interaction&quot; means, god damn it.</div></div><hr />

Still many improvments, looks Good and like a Lot of Fun to me. If People dont like what is comming with Legion, just quit the game and stop whining. It is ok to dislike something, but whining about it on mmo-c helps noone - it just annoyes other People. So please stop it - Legion is Even in Alpha, which means things Can still Change. But whining Here from non testers is just a Waste of time...</div></div><hr />

Major systems like the Class Halls will NOT be cut and redone in time for release.</div></div><hr />

The way they're changing professions and stuff, a lot of things they're taking from that game. Hm<br />
<br />
Maybe so but FFXIV took a lot of things from WoW and Guildwars 2 and the creator is an avid wow player so please don't start.</div></div><hr />

I hated the rest of the garrison but I had fun gathering followers and playing with their stats. I enjoyed seeing what stats showed up and what I could reroll as. The rest of the garrison I could do without but I had fun with that part.</div></div><hr />

This. When shipyards hit the PTR, everyone said &quot;It's just the PTR, it's not final&quot;. If players are able to test it - it's what they're going with. If they scrap class halls now, don't expect the expansion before September, at a minimum - they've already put a ton of work into them, just glancing at these articles on the front page.</div></div><hr />

Except you people keep complaining about the feature even though devs have said it doesn't work the same way as WoD. I haven't seen anything that points to them being same as in WoD, but instead you have your followers unlock quests and missions for you which you have to complete yourself to get the rewards. This instead of you sending Morc the Orc to get you that 30-60 gold for a 30-45 min mission.<br />
<br />
I can see it being a good change, while not drastic, still makes forces a player to be more active. It also should make it more varied, when you need to choose where to send the followers to &quot;scout&quot; and there's random element with counters and such involved.<br />
<br />
If this doesn't please you then too bad, it seems they are pushing it through. If it displeases you so greatly you might as well unsub and spare the rest of your whining. Since you don't seem to be providing any good alternatives for this system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A. It's not my job to provide alternatives.<br />
<br />
B. &quot;You people&quot; lumps me in with those you think are complaining, when I'm not. With the comment you quoted, I'm just discussing how once a feature is being tested, it's not going to have major changes to it, with no criticism attached to it. Please direct your bile at someone else, or comments I may have made elsewhere, criticizing their design decisions.<br />
<br />
C. I unsubbed a year ago, I made my decision then - but I still have an opinion, and I will express it here as long as Chaud and the mods allow me. Don't like it? Skip over my posts.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noxina</div><div class="date">2016-02-15, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I guess no one really heard that we're going on missions with the followers? They are more like scouts this time around.<br />
<br />
Also, wait and see how it is before you judge. Blizzard do listen to us, but when it is 5-10million people comming with feedback, it kinda gets messy, so they try to please some, and in turn let others down. I for one was very glad they removed Valor and Daily quests, as I always hated that part of the game, luckely quit before they put Valor back in though &lt;.&lt; yet another case of listening to feedback, and letting some down while pleasing others.<br />
<br />
So just stop with all your judgemental crap, if you don't like what Blizzard does with their product, just don't buy it and show them what you feel that way. Whining like a spoilt brat on a fan forum wont show them much at least. (You could always spam them with tweets, I bet they like that)</div></div><hr />

Also I think it's funny that not one person commented on the race. Shows you just how much people gave a shit about that.</div></div><hr />

I think the class halls are different. We had same devs in blizz going from vanilla to tbc and from tbc to wotlk etc..a mission in class hall will most likely send you out WITH a folllower for that mission. It will be a new &quot;daily&quot; thing i guess.<br />
Atm most of lvl up is doing everything you can to raise your artifact to max.<br />
<br />
About the dungeon race, ofc EU won as most predicted :P , but thats because we had an enha shaman in hehehe, Fury of air is op .</div></div><hr />
