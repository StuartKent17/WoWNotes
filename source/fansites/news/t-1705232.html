Patch 6.0.3 Hotfixes - February 5<br />
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br />
<br />
Blackrock Foundry<br />
<br />
Resolved an issue where Slagshop Brutes may sometimes not reset correctly if the raid wipes while they're casting Death Howl.<br />
Hans'gar &amp; Franzok<br />
<br />
Hans’gar and Franzok’s Crippling Suplex now deals 30% less damage (200,000 damage on Raid Finder, 450,000 damage on Normal, 600,000 damage on Heroic, and 700,000 damage on Mythic).<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackhand<br />
<br />
Blackhand's Impaling Throw damage dealt to Siegemakers should now properly scale up based on the number of players in the Raid.<br />
Visuals for Marked for Death and Slag Eruptions should now be easier to see.<br />
Players should now only receive a single debuff that refreshes when running through Blazes created by Siegemaker Mortar attacks.<br />
Resolved an issue that could cause some Hunters or Warlocks to suffer fatal falling damage during the transition to Stage Three: Iron Crucible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds and Arenas<br />
<br />
Faction flags should no longer appear for players in an Arena or Arena Skirmish match.</div></div><hr />

I don't play with them. 6 million people playing in china doesn't really affect me. 2 million in Europe doesn't really affect me. To me the game has 2 million in NA and that's the only number I see. World wide numbers when all the regions are locked out is useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you think Q1 numbers will be 6-8 million your absolutely high and off into the clouds...More realistic figure would be a continued climb to 11-11.5 million.</div></div><hr />

Lol unless 6.1 brings some actual content, your beloved garrisons are not going to hold 10million+ subscribers.

Well, they sooner or later will go down anyway. Subs are from the end of 2014, and that was only about 6 weeks after release of WoD. People were still all up in Highmaul. Wait for the next conference calls. Subs are gonna go down, depending on how fast they deliver new content, depending on how good it is, and depending on how much there will be to do outside of raids.</div></div><hr />

Who was expecting numbers to go down??????...... It`s the Q4 numbers of 2014 with a exp launche.<br />
<br />
when the Q1 numbers of 2015 comes, we can talk again and see who many was wrong on the numbers. Stormrage eu is allmost back to it`s graveyard status again. Many guilds are deing again. Guilds are looking for new mambers all the time, because people are stopping again in bulks.<br />

Such ignorance. Nowhere, ever. Will you find me saying I want WoW to die and it's subs to go down. I just realize how lacking WoD is and if MoP dropped to 6 million subs then God better send Blizzard a prayer because WoD blows and lacks everything.</div></div><hr />

Am also sure your one of those people that thought WoW would never go above 10 million people. Prepare to be wrong again..For many people it ain't even about the game it's a social Facebook to do stupid things, and 6.1 is bring even more of that with Selfie Cameras and you name it. As the game reaches closer to possible Burning Legion influence/set-up and draw closer to Gul'dan it will hold interest and people will keep coming..Anyone that's been playing since BC has been waiting for that moment for 8 years. Q1 will see a climb.</div></div><hr />

That would be a violation to state subscription numbers which didn't match the quarter they are reporting on. The Jan/Feb/March numbers will come around the beginning of May.<br />
<br />
Come the end of March we may have 6.1 out already and be deep into Foundry. I don't see any huge losses happening soon.</div></div><hr />

I think you should look over your sources, they are from the 19th december 2014 early WOD launch. This isn't a ''stable 10 mill'' this is the ''new expansions spike''. The launch spike is impressive indeed, but this is just misinformation.</div></div><hr />

Obviously if a game has 100k subs, it's awesome to those 100k.<br />

You're right.<br />

Just like reality TV shows are probably awesome to a lot of people. Or facebook games.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And no, food is not comparable to the game. No one goes to McDonalds for good food, they go for a quick &quot;I'm hungry, I need food now&quot;. No one picks up a bad game saying &quot;I just need to play a game quickly&quot;<br />

<br />
Just like reality TV shows are probably awesome to a lot of people. Or facebook games.<br />
<br />
So where did I say anything about food?<br />
<br />
Because everyone turns that first part into &quot;Food&quot; or something else. Just like you tried to turn it into other irrelevant topics, because TV and FB games are exactly the same as WoW.<br />
<br />
And yes, reality TV shows are awesome to a lot of people, so who the hell cares? Also reality TV shows are for the most part technically free to watch, chances are if you're paying for other channels, they're gonna be there, and people will watch them to make fun of them.<br />
<br />
And I've never heard of a Facebook game having 10 million players, and while it might be possible, yet again I guess I should elaborate, those games are MEANT to be picked up and dropped randomly. Also they're free.<br />
<br />
WoW requires being bought and paid for monthly, no one is going to continue doing that if they literally think the game is 100% trash. So just stop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As others have said, the real interesting tidbit is going to be when the first and second quarter numbers are released, and I think that's when we're going to see a fairly sharp dip in subscriptions, given how the general response to WoD now that the expansions been out for awhile has been &quot;great leveling, terrible end-game&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm not thinking it'll dip down to six million again this shortly after, but it is going to dip, and by a sizeable amount I'd wager. I will be genuinely surprised if it doesn't.</div></div><hr />

I don't think we will. Foundry is, from what I've read, pretty damn good (haven't tested it out myself yet), and 6.1 should be just around the corner. While I do personally expect a slight decline in Q1, I wouldn't be that suprised if the subs actually increased.</div></div><hr />

Depends on how Blizzard plays there cards...What they would need to do then is throw a huge curve ball and kick start some Burning Legion and get Sargares and Kil'jaeden happening..

Welcome to MMO champion, friend. Enjoy your stay. This has been as stigma of this site. The current expansion is always the worst thing ever, and the game will surely go down the toilet. This has been a thing on this site since Wrath of the Lich King. You can bet your house that if Q1 doesn't show a significant drop, they'll immidiately say ''Just wait til Q2''. Actually, don't you'll be homeless.</div></div><hr />

Exactly this, those scrubs will just keep repeating it every quarter, cause obviously at SOME point WoW will lose subs again, and when that happens they will be all like &quot;OMG SEE I TOLD YOU SO !!!1111 HerpDerp&quot;, like they made a prediction on the level of Nostradamus or something... ah well.</div></div><hr />

And people saying WoW is dying are ignorant. Even with 5 mil subcriders they have more then enough income.<br />

It's just a fact that people have seen it and will be bored out of the game fast again. It is the same game for many years now, atleast the core is. No wonder that people will eventually have enough of it.<br />

I find it very impressive that Blizzard does keep getting the players and ofcourse new players back in the game.</div></div><hr />

How arrogant must one be to even think that this i a truth and not just bitter opinion? Major lol. It's like they need to dismiss everyone not agreeing with them as less important because their wittle hearts can't stand the thought of someone liking something that they do not or whatever reason they have for dismissing millions of people as having low standards. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
WoW has the highest quality out of all mmorpg's I've played. Someone else might disagree and say GW2 is where it's at, or Archeage, and that's fine by me. Doesn't change how much I enjoy the game I therefore choose to stick with. ^^<br />

I must say though that it's pretty obvious that these numbers won't remain, they never do.</div></div><hr />

I didn't say that a game that is objectively worse is likely to be extremely successful, just that it's not all just &quot;different opinions/different tastes&quot; whatever, and that bigger numbers don't mean it's a better product. And if that was the case, then WoW has only gotten worse over the years, because it lost subscribers, and then Cataclysm was the best expansion.</div></div><hr />

Predicting a loss isn't exactly like performing rocket science. Losses are the expected, they are natural. But you know, if you keep repeating every quarter that &quot;next one they'll decrease&quot;, you'll eventually get it right.<br />
<br />
In any case, I did expect a loss this time around. I'll be surprised if they maintain or gain subs next quarter. Pleasantly surprised, but surprised nonetheless. I fully expect a loss. Not because I'm rooting for them to lose subs or because I dislike the game now, but because losses aren't some unnatural doomsday prediction.</div></div><hr />

There's some truth to that but come on. When the news is relatively good the cry goes up &quot;Wait until next quarter!! You'll see!!&quot;. Of course it will be down next quarter. That's how it works now. They could have done more to mitigate that by putting more into 6.1. So 6.1 will prop up the numbers a bit for 2015Q1 and 6.2 will no doubt be planned to drop in late May or June for 2015Q2. That's also is probably how they would like for it to work.</div></div><hr />

After 10 years of having 10 million subscriptions. Yes. If this was month 3 of release then there would be no data to backup this claim. But we're 10 years into it, 2 million shy of the peak. The data is in front of your face.<br />

They didn't have 10 million subscriptions for 10 years.<br />
<br />
And I think WoW is the prime example of where people stick with the game, because they have some emotional attachment or they have some kind of community they are invested in. How many people stuck around during the 14 months of SoO because they enjoyed the company of their friends, not because they actually liked what the game had to offer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Objectively, yes. If the game is making money than, in the objective sense, it is a good game. Profitability is really the only objective means of determining a game's quality. Since WoW continues to make more money than any of it's competitors, it is, objectively speaking, the best game in it's genre. <br />
<br />
Subjectively, every person has to decide for themselves whether or not WoW is a good game. The numbers at the end of December show that 10 million people seem to think so.</div></div><hr />

Q4 ends at 12/31/2014 which is more than a month after WoD's release. <br />

The thing is, you're trying to prove that people who only paid a month would have dropped by then when in fact the data is showing that people paid for more than one month since WoD's release.</div></div><hr />

We're looking at a few months long period between BRF and the next raid. Once people get bored of BRF, they will start quitting. We'll have to see how many (or how few) players leave. The fact that they hadn't started leaving by now already proves that Blizzard got WoD right - the future reports will only show how well they did. If they continue pacing the content as well as they did with HM and BRF, I'm pretty sure the sub drop will be low by WoW's standards. But what if subs don't drop at all? It will be safe to say we're looking at a WoW renaissance. It's actually likely, since we'll be able to legally buy gametime with gold soon, so plenty of players that would only sub for short periods after each tier is released, will be more likely to stay subbed for the whole time.</div></div><hr />

In other words of course there were still 10 million subs in December if they are still on the first month of their sub. What we are more interested in is the sub loss since the new year when subscriptions would have been cancelled/run out from people un impressive by WoD.</div></div><hr />

And I think WoW is the prime example of where people stick with the game, because they have some emotional attachment or they have some kind of community they are invested in. How many people stuck around during the 14 months of SoO because they enjoyed the company of their friends, not because they actually liked what the game had to offer.<br />
<br />
Keep arguing until you rationalize that you are correct. So now the only reason WoW is popular is because people have friends? The whole point of an online game is to play with others. Otherwise it would be a.....get this...SINGLE PLAYER. Why aren't other games retaining players? People have to be making friends right? Maybe it's because they aren't a better game than WoW.</div></div><hr />

MoP was clearly the wrong direction for WoW and the subs prove that, WoD brought a lot of people back with the old BC-nostalgia feel Blizz was going for to drag people in but let's see if WoD can hold for another quarter or two. Personally I do not like it nor am I playing until we get an xpac that isn't about orcs or other faggotry like pandas. (vampires next Blizz??? #teamedward)<br />
<br />
I'm pretty confident that a large portion of the playerbase wants the next burning legion expansion or any of the other amazing stories unfinished but WoW has been like watching One Piece these last few years, 90% filler. Now you got shitty facebook apps in-game ala garrison and live twitter feed! #hashtagyolo</div></div><hr />

Just because you don't play these, doesn't mean plenty of other people don't. There are certainly some games in this list than hold my interest more than WoW does. <br />
<br />
The time-gating and slow release of raids to allow them to pretend more content is being released, when in actual fact its already developed, doesn't really cut it for me any more. <br />
<br />
At this stage, I can totally see myself going back to GW 2 once Heart of Thorns releases.</div></div><hr />

Are you raiding at all and on a PVE/PVP realm? Around the portals to raids its crazy here on shadowsong at time. Few 100 peeps at normal raid times easy. Finding a group with the group finder feels way more smooth also.<br />
<br />
I do allot of social things in the game though such as camping rares in large groups sometimes 3 groups of 40 people so i guess this helps towards feeling that more people are around.<br />

The new local hub does look dead at times in all fairness i will say that.</div></div><hr />

Not according to the rules they use to report subscriptions.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft subscribers include individuals who have paid a subscription fee or have an active prepaid card to play World of Warcraft, as well as those who have purchased the game and are within their free month of access. Internet game room players who have accessed the game over the last thirty days are also counted as subscribers. The above definition excludes all players under free promotional subscriptions, expired or cancelled subscriptions, and expired prepaid cards. Subscribers in licensees’ territories are defined along the same rules.</div></div><hr />

I returned to WoW after about 4 years, and I found myself playing with half of my old guild under a different banner. Most of them also came back for WoD, though they quit later than I did. It's not just a feeling, WoD did bring tons of players back. I personally think I'm here to stay now, and so are my guildies. It will depend on how good the next patches are, but yeah, the basis is very solid.</div></div><hr />

I think the new veteran account status thing is going to be pretty huge, a lot of people are going to want to come back and play on their real account, and then will get sucked in again.

Revenue, earnings per share, both badly missed for Q4 and 2015 projections were also lowered from expected. Granted this is on Activision-Blizzard as a whole and not focusing solely on wow. This is a business article on today's report from Barron's, which is a more realistic view:<br />
<br />
Video game maker Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) reported Q4 revenue fell 2.6%, year over year, to $2.21 billion, yielding EPS of 94 cents. Analysts had been modeling $2.24 billion and 88 cents. For the current quarter, the company projected revenue of $640 million, and EPS of 5 cents. That’s way below consensus for $775 million and 18 cents. For the full year, the company sees revenue of $4.4 billion and EPS of $1.15, also below consensus of $4.7 billion and $1.42. Activision noted the rising U.S. dollar will hit its results harder this year than last, given half its revenue is from overseas. Activision also said its board approved a two-year repurchase plan of $750 million, and increased the company’s quarterly dividend to 23 cents from 20 cents. Activision shares dropped $1.76, or 8%, to $20.06.</div></div><hr />

Hello, welcome to the grown-ups table. This was from a financial statement. They ALWAYS do it the same way. Subscription numbers 90% of the time are always from a day about 40 days ago. The only time the release numbers outside of that is occassionally for PR, when they announced 10M subsc shortly after WoD.<br />
<br />
But again, financial statements always ( for the past 10 years) been a little more than a month late. The same way ALL companies release their finanical earnings about 30-45 days after the end of the quarter they are reporting.</div></div><hr />

Publicly traded companies are not only required to report their prior quarter's result but provide realistic guidance as to their expected returns in the next quarter that shareholders can use as a basis to make decisions on whether or not to buy or sell shares. <br />
<br />
In their guidance for the next quarter Blizzard has told their shareholders they expect subs to decline.<br />
<br />
So, it doesn't matter if you're a fanboy or a hater - Blizzard themselves are predicting sub losses in Q1. <br />
<br />
And they wouldn't be making that predication if a) it wasn't the most likely outcome and b) without knowledge of the latest real time current subscribers numbers that they have but which aren't included in the Q4 report ending Dec 31, 2014.<br />
<br />
So y'all can stop arguing - there will be sub losses in Q1 - the only question is how many.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much unprecedented in video game history for a non-competitive, sub based game to remain this popular this long.<br />

How can WoD sell 3.3 million copies when there are only 3.3 people in the world!?</div></div><hr />

You were the one who made the statement that a one month subscription would still be active after a 6 week period. I can quote exactly what you said if you like:<br />
<br />
<br />
You guys should have they reported 10 million in November why would it drop the month after a new expansion everyone who came back was still subbed till Jan 1st. Now when the 1st quarter report is released you will see a huge drop I am sure.<br />
<br />
Let me break it down for you really simple. WOD launched on November 13. Now normally any subs cancelled during that period would officially expire on December 13. However, due to launch Issues, Blizzard added an extra 5 days to all active accounts. So those accounts would be extended until the 18th of December. Even with that though...by the time January 1st rolled around those accounts would still have been expired for about 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />

i expected it to be higher seeing as these numbers are so close to launch.<br />
<br />
Q1 and Q2 numbers will be interesting, I expect at least to be back down near 6-8 million by Q2<br />
<br />
Lol@ people who think these are CURRENT numbers.<br />
<br />
Not 6m WoWs subs have never fallen that fast. 8m probably. Guessing 8.4m Quarter 2.</div></div><hr />

I would like to note that, according to the graph in this post, subscriptions rose during the burning crusade and wrath of the lich king. Only during cataclysm and mists of pandaria did subscriptions drop after the release of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

Revenue, earnings per share, both badly missed for Q4 and 2015 projections were also lowered from expected. Granted this is on Activision-Blizzard as a whole and not focusing solely on wow. This is a business article on today's report from Barron's, which is a more realistic view:<br />
<br />
Video game maker Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) reported Q4 revenue fell 2.6%, year over year, to $2.21 billion, yielding EPS of 94 cents. Analysts had been modeling $2.24 billion and 88 cents. For the current quarter, the company projected revenue of $640 million, and EPS of 5 cents. That’s way below consensus for $775 million and 18 cents. For the full year, the company sees revenue of $4.4 billion and EPS of $1.15, also below consensus of $4.7 billion and $1.42. Activision noted the rising U.S. dollar will hit its results harder this year than last, given half its revenue is from overseas. Activision also said its board approved a two-year repurchase plan of $750 million, and increased the company’s quarterly dividend to 23 cents from 20 cents. Activision shares dropped $1.76, or 8%, to $20.06.<br />
<br />
Activision is not just WoW. They have a huge portfolio of games and alot of them can fail and not meet expectation.<br />
<br />
Wow is not one of them</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, as by November 14th people would have been gone if they didnt like it. I imagine subs will fall to some 9m number for Quarter 1, and 8m for quarter 2. I doubt WoD numbers will fall below 6.7m, so WoD will have been a net gain over MoP.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
If you think Q1 numbers will be 6-8 million your absolutely high and off into the clouds...More realistic figure would be a continued climb to 11-11.5 million.<br />
<br />
I doubt that too. A lot of people are unhappy with WoD now. All the polls since January have shown peoples interest plummeting.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I&quot;m surprised about HoTS having 9 million Register users. Also i can guess that now WoW subs are below 10mill. But i also believe that Blizzard doesn't really care about subs numbers anymore unless they lose ALOT in Q1.<br />
<br />
Yeah, as long as subs keep going down and bouncing back they dont care. The next expansion will see another rise to 9-10m probably too. WoWs going to be the King for another 5 or 6 years, and massively profitable for another 10-15.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This guy gets it. By the time people resubbed for the new expansion, their subs did not cancel by the time the quarter reports were calculated. So, in short these numbers are outdated.<br />

Yeah, they have been saying WOW would die since late wrath, and here 5 years later WoWs still at wrath numbers as of December 2014.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, they sooner or later will go down anyway. Subs are from the end of 2014, and that was only about 6 weeks after release of WoD. People were still all up in Highmaul. Wait for the next conference calls. Subs are gonna go down, depending on how fast they deliver new content, depending on how good it is, and depending on how much there will be to do outside of raids.<br />
<br />
Well to think about it, BRF lfr opening fully in March plus 6.1 in March, subs may only drop a few hundred k. Subs will either hold if 6.2 is amazing, or freefall if its not. We will see. Worst case scenario WoD ends around MoP lows. Best case, it ends higher than the 7.5m average of MoP. 8m for WoD is possible of the content is good.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
These numbers are meaningless. Of course the people subscribed in the middle of November will still be subbed in December. If January's numbers were good, they'd have been included as well. They were not, so read between the lines on that one.<br />
<br />
I want to see the next quarter numbers, when the decline comes.<br />
<br />
And really, let's not brag too much over 10MM. WoW is a whopping 10% ahead of where it was at the very bottom of Cata. That's not good enough.<br />
<br />
And its where WOW was during TBC and A lot of Wrath. It is good enough.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, the game could gain 10 million subscribers, and it could still be shit. The game could have 100k subscribers and it could be awesome.<br />
<br />
If WoW has 100m players, thats proof enough of its quality. Obviously 10m people think WOW is worth the money. 6 months ago 7m people thought WoW was still worth the money.<br />

Who was expecting numbers to go down??????...... It`s the Q4 numbers of 2014 with a exp launche.<br />
<br />
when the Q1 numbers of 2015 comes, we can talk again and see who many was wrong on the numbers. Stormrage eu is allmost back to it`s graveyard status again. Many guilds are deing again. Guilds are looking for new mambers all the time, because people are stopping again in bulks.<br />
<br />
My guild is dead again and this time i don`t think it will be saved.<br />
<br />
Just like it wouldnt be saved at the end of Cata or MoP. :rolleyes:<br />

But WoD is the worst expansion ever!! No content, professions ruined and garrisons are dumb!<br />
<br />
Or at least that's what nearly every WoD discussion thread claims. Not that I agree with those statements, but nice to see the numbers prove the haters wrong.<br />
<br />
Profs are going to be fixed, or at least decent enough in 6.1. 6.1 isn't good, but its still a better patch than 5.3.</div></div><hr />

They reported, in November, that they hit 10mil subs.<br />

Of course it still has 10 mil subs for the quarterly report, the subs haven't had time to change (for better or worse) in that time. Saying it's &quot;stable&quot; at 10mil subs is just dishonest, it hasn't even stayed at 10mil for a full quarter yet. You can start telling us it's &quot;stable&quot; once it has stayed at roughly the same sub count for at least a couple quarters.

I don't pretend to know what sub losses will be down the road, but using bad data to claim people are not leaving is silly.

This report is incredibly dishonest. They over and over say that they had &quot;10 million subscribers at years end&quot;, and in NO WAY say that current numbers are at 10 million. Likewise if you look at the actual earnings based on subscription, its rather notable that they are BARELY over last years Q4 (which was 7.8 million subscribers), and those earnings also count cash shop buying making it all the more misleading.<br />
<br />
A shame MMO-champion didn't actually read the report before posting this tripe. Blizz has not posted their subscribers numbers. They are infact dodging around the question. They are being dishonest to investors, and I hope someone calls them out for it.<br />

<br />
As others have said, the real interesting tidbit is going to be when the first and second quarter numbers are released, and I think that's when we're going to see a fairly sharp dip in subscriptions, given how the general response to WoD now that the expansions been out for awhile has been &quot;great leveling, terrible end-game&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm not thinking it'll dip down to six million again this shortly after, but it is going to dip, and by a sizeable amount I'd wager. I will be genuinely surprised if it doesn't.<br />
<br />
I think it's already started dipping. The Nov release said above 10 million. If it had climbed even a little bit say to 10.1 million then Blizzard would have put that in the release because it's good marketing. I just think that the drop has been minor so far. Q1 will be heavy.</div></div><hr />

For all we know it could have went from 10.9 million to 10.1 million, since they are being so vague with numbers. In the past they gave more specific numbers, rounded to 100,000. Why are they being so vague now? And it was only a month since the previous report and WoD was still pretty new. With the state it's in now, and nothing exciting coming up in 6.1, I'd bet that they numbers will go way down next quarter.</div></div><hr />

Because buying 2month subscription is more efficient, i bought mine just before WoD and i still have 24 days and I am not planning to sub again (for now).<br />
So i assume VERY most of these people currently subbed just bought 2 month sub. Q1 will be more reliable, however i dont expect numbers to go down very much.</div></div><hr />

My account ended on the 4th of december and I started a new sub on the 10th for playing rbg two times. After that I stopped playing until the 2nd of january. My last day in WoW was on the 4th and my sub ended on 10th and since then I had no active sub.<br />
<br />
So these 10 million subscribers mean nothing. They had 10.x million on WoD release and got a lot due christmas, but the numbers don't say how many are still active. I know at least two people who subbed for 3 month and stopped playing after christmas. They are &quot;active accounts&quot; but they don't play anymore. So how accurate are those numbers? I don't know, neither do you.<br />
<br />
I'm one such person. My sub ran out in January. So I'm in this 10m, but I won't be in the next earnings call, and I know two others who are the same as me - yeah, they still had a sub in December, but now they don't. In December I was pretty sure I'd keep playing indefinitely but I was over in January and I am NOT alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
correction: looking at the graph, for MoP the subs spiked to 10mil then dropped, for cata subs stayed peaked at 12mil.<br />
<br />
I think, if anything, what this will show blizzard is to never ever again try an expansion theme that doesn't have the &quot;grit&quot; and darkness of the traditional warcraft universe. And also that new expansions should = new continents/worlds to explore. <br />
<br />
WoD marks a change back to the more accepted warcraft theme, and much of the content has never been more accessible to all skill levels. Now if they can keep up content updates and giving players more reasons to stay engaged remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />

They over and over say that they had &quot;10 million subscribers at years end&quot;, and in NO WAY say that current numbers are at 10 million. Likewise if you look at the actual earnings based on subscription, its rather notable that they are BARELY over last years Q4 (which was 7.8 million subscribers), and those earnings also count cash shop buying making it all the more misleading.<br />
<br />
A shame MMO-champion didn't actually read the report before posting this tripe. Blizz has not posted their subscribers numbers. They are infact dodging around the question. They are being dishonest to investors, and I hope someone calls them out for it.<br />
<br />
These are quarterly reports for shareholders. So they're quarterly. The sub numbers are just a nice thing to include by the way, it's not a proper financial metric.<br />
<br />
The numbers are not there to facilitate your internet arguments. Most companies don't release sub numbers at all, except maybe to celebrate a milestone once in a while.</div></div><hr />

You say they are high, then you spew a claim that is, quite frankly, absurd. There was a surge after the expansion dropped, that is to be expected. I Highly doubt it will continue to climb. We cannot say a &quot;realistic figure&quot; as of yet. However, we can go by what we have. So far, we have a Lot of people on these and the official forums complaining about a lack of things to do. Several of the posts in the official forums have high rates. 6.1 is bringing next to no content as of the time being other then a Ton of garrison tweaks.<br />
<br />
I just do not understand people who are surprised by this. Its great they managed to at least retain 10Mil for a month, but its not too far fetched to believe that it wasn't really their doing to retain it. December was a major holiday month for gifts and such. People may have also added more time to give the raid a chance that had just come out. Its not unexpected to believe people may have also been given time cards to keep playing, I know I was given a few for the holidays. <br />
<br />
Point is, the report is not surprising. It stayed the same for a month, nearly two. It had no movement negative or positive. We cannot predict where it is going to go as far as the sub numbers are concerned. Q1 and Q2 in 2015 will be interesting to see.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, MoP was soooo lighthearted. Mogu slaughtering countless pandaren and melting their bodies into one giant mass of congealed blood, bone and flesh to create more Mogu, Orcs impaling trolls and humans and apparently shooting arrows at them, likely while they were in their last death throes, Shado-pan not above brutal torture to get information.<br />

<br />
Its dangerous to use forums as any sort of reliable indicator though, apart from the fact its only a few thousand people posting on them versus the millions of people playing the game, and apart from the fact that the very large majority of casual players probably haven't looked at a forum in their lives, people are also generally less inclined to go on a forum and post threads about how happy they are with everything. People come to forums to complain or vent and offer up suggestions for things they don't like or want changed, so its very easy to get the wrong idea if thats where you're sourcing your data from. Its a very biased source.</div></div><hr />

The figures get onto fan sites etc, and all of a sudden it is Blizzard showing off?

I quit mid cata because it was dreadful and then I came back for this expansion. At first it felt fine because there was so much to catch up with, but now it's back to the same ol' crap. Nothing has changed. PvP is still horrible... balancing is out the window which means PvE is the only go to. I don't mind raiding, but considering the fact that PvP and PvE have been around from the get go, you'd think they'd put a high priority on both and not just one. The game was amazing back in TBC because it was balanced. Raiding was exciting and fun (hasn't really changed much since then) but PvP has declined since wotlk. Cata completely flipped PvP and ruined it... to combat their mistakes, blizzard lazily reset everyone's mmr including those that earned it fairly. This expansion is no different than cata. PvP is a mess while PvE is doing alright. Instead of allocating resources to improve PvP, they're busy working on solo content which IMO has no place in mmorpg's. I picked up this game because I love co-op games. There might be 10 million players, but if most of them are busy in their own worlds where i'll never come in contact with them, then why is the game even an mmorpg? Why don't they just shut down the servers and make it a single player game??? I know the playerbase has changed and majority are casuals who enjoy single player content, but don't focus on those players. I'm sick of this garrison crap. This is the kind of crap i'd expect in some single player game... not a game that once advertised about working with others to kill massive dragons. <br />
<br />
I don't have an issue with single player content if it's a lower priority than both PvE and PvP, but it's quite clear that isn't the case. To each their own though... those that loved cata/mop will love this expansion and that's just the playerbase changing. I'm just an old school player who enjoyed the tedious grind which offered amazing awards in the end, but unfortunately my breed is dying.</div></div><hr />
