Patch 7.3.2 - Silithus Past Time Traveling Spell<br />
Patch 7.3.2 adds a wound (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7000-Patch-7-3-2-PTR-Build-25079) to Silithus. You can get more context by listening to the VO (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7000-Patch-7-3-2-PTR-Build-25079) and reading the old Sargeras shirt description (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7048-World-of-Warcraft-BlizzCon-Gear-Store-Merchandise-Overwatch-Halloween-Terror-Event). <br />
<br />
A recent PTR build added a spell that will allow you to go back to the version of Silithus that existed prior to the Wound in the World, similar to spells that allow you to go back to the old Blasted Lands or Theramore.<br />

Solo Gul'dan Kill<br />
Mionelol (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/548309-Mionelol) had another impressive solo kill recently, with a Normal Gul'dan kill!<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hd1lXxXdUMY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Gul'dan! Darkness Incarnate. <br />
<br />
How gracious of Blizzard to have created a whole cinematic just for me. <br />
<br />
This encounter would be pretty simple if it did not have an enrage timer, however I can safely say that timer is unbeatable with current DPS. Gul'dan himself has 1.04b HP, while enrage happens at 12 minutes. That's around 1.4million DPS, even disregarding phase 1 where he's immune to damage. <br />
<br />
But of course, enrage timers aren't really a thing that have stopped me in the past, have they? <br />
<br />
Gul'dan's enrage is one of those enrages that have a limited duration of 30 minutes; and thankfully, Gul'dan conveniently pacifies himself (more or less) during phase 1, which, combined with the fact the Inquisitor cannot move and has a maximum range on his Dark Blast, makes timing out the enrage possible, although it requires bandaging on cd and accurate cd usage+positioning in order to survive the +900% damage Liquid Hellfire casts. Prydaz helps tremendously with surviving, with the absorb shield being up on every hellfire, however I did not want to use Prydaz for the remainder of the fight and opted to survive without using it. Who would have thought first aid would be useful in Legion? <br />
<br />
It'd be pretty simple if it stopped there, however thankfully for Gul'dan, his adds also gain the enrage buff, which includes both the phase 1 adds and the eyes he summons frequently during phase 2 and 3. And, of course, that includes the eyes he summons even after Gul'dan himself is not affected by enrage anymore, which leads to the major struggle of this fight; how to deal with eyes that have a 900% damage buff? That's 2.5m damage taken per second, per eye. Each eye also buffs its damage with every tick, and duplicates relatively quickly if not killed, so it is imperative to dispose of them ASAP. My gear is entirely tailored towards that need (20% avoidance cap, extremely heavy emphasis on mastery/vers, moroes ring (http://www.wowdb.com/items/142171-seal-of-darkshire-nobility), double active trinkets) <br />
<br />
Of course, eye spawns overlap with his other abilities, mainly Fel Scythe and Bonds of Fel, which, while not particularly threatening by themselves, still deal a non negligible amount of damage and can be deadly when overlapping with eyes. <br />
<br />
In Phase 2, the duplicate eyes do not have the enrage buff, which makes them not too threatening (although it can still quickly get out of control if not rapidly kept in check), however in phase 3 the duplicates *do* enrage, which can very quickly lead to disaster. Moreoever, phase 3 has the dreaded &quot;two eyes back to back&quot; spawn, happening regularly, which is difficult to deal with, as you do not have infinite cooldowns at your disposal. Thankfully, that's also the only threat of phase 3. It nearly killed me towards the very end <br />
<br />
Either way, enjoy the kill! This took 1 hour and 9 minutes in total, however the fight truly begins at the 42:30ish mark, so that's more of a 27 minute fight. <br />
<br />
Gear: ilvl 943, artifact level 69. <br />

Retribution Paladin Mobility<br />
People generally see mobility as primarily gap closing and are not considering the ability to DPS on the move, which I think is what Ythisens is getting at.<br />
This is generally what I'm talking about. Mobility and movement are not just gap closing, its the ability to get in, get out, and ignore, because if you can stand in an ability and not need to move through whatever means of negating it, then you're essentially eliminating the need to move at all.<br />
<br />
Really that quote came out of me not wording it correctly so that's my fault. What I should have said was &quot;Retribution Paladins have great mobility/utility options for movement.&quot;<br />
<br />
This hurt to read. How do Blessings help mobility?<br />
<br />
&gt; LUL maybe he thought pvp talents work in pve XD.<br />
<br />
There have been a lot of encounters over the years that have mechanics that you can ignore due to Blessing of Freedom and Blessing of Protection. I can't tell you how many times Freedom has saved me or a raid member during Mistress Sassz'ine alone this tier. Freedom and Blessing both are great utility options that Retribution can bring if they're needed especially if you have great reaction and raid awareness. There have been mechanics that you can actually eliminate by casting Blessing of Protection on someone the fraction of a second they're targeted before its applied if you're fast enough. If you're using these abilities in the right way they're considered mobility options in an encounter.<br />
<br />
Also, so that everyone is still aware, I'm a Community Manager and its just my opinion on the state of the Retribution. You can totally disagree with my assessment and that's fine. Retribution is fun to me and has been ever since I picked it up after Wrath went live and I'll honestly play it regardless of the state.<br />
<br />
I do still agree with some of the suggestions and opinions here but I don't personally think we need huge changes or overhauls, just little tweaks but overall we're fine.

When he added the 'asshole' part, he kinda gave it away of him just being jelly. I think Mionelol can afford to be a little cocky after such a record.</div></div><hr />

Also, it's amusingly fitting that the person killing Gul'dan has Archimonde and Kil'jaeden legendaries.<br />

And yeah, it's not really cocky if she's done this again and again. It's a true statement delivered in an amusing and confident way. She didn't, as far as I saw, put any other players down.</div></div><hr />

There were so many hints in MoP that there was to be a Legion expansion next and then we got blindsided with WoD. We're defiently getting a Void expansion 'soon' but I'm hoping we have something more like MoP - a breather from world/universe-ending baddies.</div></div><hr />

I know what the next expansion is likely to be, but that doesn't have anything to do with my thinking it was an interim scenario, not a Blasted Lands style change to the zone.<br />

Well the last MoP patch had Timeless Isle and Siege of Orgrimmar. People were just wishing for something that sounds less stupid than WoD. But don't worry. You still have about three weeks left that you can spend in denial and hope for WotLK 2.0 or whatever all you people want.</div></div><hr />

you know what would change beliefs someone uploading a video of a dps, managing to tank/heal down a 10man raid boss, when a 943 tank has a really hard time surviving that damage.<br />
<br />
so yeh i'll say you're talking bullshit, and you can continue talking BS or upload a video as proof and i'll say damn that's fucking impressive i can't believe it could be done by a rogue, it's far more impressive than mione's kill hats off to you. but without a video it is just words on a forum that are meaningless.</div></div><hr />

The issue is you posting in the first place...and then with this post...<br />
<br />
You have nothing to back it up, yet it feels like you want to be praised because you posted that you did this already.<br />

I once posted a million years ago a video clearing scholomance and stratholme as a level 70 rogue with one epic item. I had proof via a video, yet a hunter had to post that he had done this before me at level 60 or something. What was the point of the post? If not to be praised or to say that my achievement was not worth it. I simply posted to show that it could be done, nothing else. And it was nice to read a bunch of posts saying &quot;grats&quot; and &quot;thank you for the info&quot;.<br />
<br />
So to Mionelol, grats and thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />

The last patch was about timetravel and orcs so we wrren't blindsided. Most of us just would have preferred the wod leaks to be bad fan fiction as it was quite bad. Now we had naga and void showed down our throats since day one and the void is super strong on Argus, which became available in the last patch.<br />
<br />
The new expansion will be about the void. Anyone who claims otherwise is just in denial.</div></div><hr />

People believe what they want to believe. But what I said is true. I really did solo him and that's all I'm gonna say about it. Go praise someone who craves the praise. (not you, amp. I mean the naysayers)<br />
<br />
You literally have no proof. You're using a class that doesn't have enough defensive cooldowns to pull it off, and you want people to believe that you did it without some sort of cheating. Dude... <br />
<br />
You're obviously trying to get the praise or you wouldn't be bragging about something that didn't happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ahh so gender pronouns are proper nouns now? Good to know. It's a good thing you aren't capitalizing the feminine pronoun in a veiled attempt to poke at the assumption that mione is a dude because the name sounds feminine.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure it -is- a dude, confirmed no less...but WK'ing may pay off..</div></div><hr />
