DREAM Paragon posted an interesting comparison of the Firelands Raid 10 and 25-Man fights on their site. This is probably a good read for guilds wondering if it's time to switch to 10-man because things are feeling harder, and all the 10-man raids out there can most likely steal their setup if they feel like they're struggling on something.

DREAM Paragon's conclusion on differences between 10-man and 25-Man<br />
It's immediately obvious that there's a much greater degree of clarity and control in the 10-mans. Thinking logically, this should help quite a lot with the learning curve and avoiding mistakes, but that's not really something we could say our little skirmish 'proved' in practice. We already knew what the encounters were about and what the flame to avoid looked like -- relearning to accommodate differences is very different than learning from scratch.<br />
<br />
A theme of more significance that you can clearly see in the three harder bosses for this tier is that the dps requirement is much too lenient in 10-man. This means that you don't really have to cut the amount of healers, which ensures relaxed gameplay for the healers while about half of their 25-man brethren are taking beta blockers just to be able to see clearly. The other half is naturally on the bench, sitting out for the extra dps. Perhaps this is a backlash from what we've been hearing about T11, but it really doesn't work as it is.<br />
<br />
Proper tuning has repercussions though, since class balance has a huge impact when you're forced into two-heal and solo heal situations. And that's not even a stretch -- don't be surprised if you see a druid solo healing Ragnaros 10 hc before this tier is over. Might or might not happen, but at least it seemed plausible enough. Try doing that with a shaman. <br />
<br />
This leads us to the fact that the gap between an optimal setup and the wrong setup seems to be quite a bit larger in 10-man than in 25s. If the encounters are really hard, you'll need a proper setup. Guilds shooting for a world first should always be expected to come up with one, but those below, the ones without alt raids, will be left hanging. If the encounters are tuned for the 'average' setup, guilds who can afford the optimal one will steamroll through them.<br />
<br />
If we were really playing 10-man, we *would* have a close to optimal setup. Even right now, scaled down from 25 to 10, we would have about 14 players and 30-ish fully raid-capable characters. The difficulty and tuning we're concerned about is for that scenario, not for the level where you're simply enjoying the game with the hand you've been dealt.<br />

Hence why you'll find people on 10-man stuck on Beth'tilac because they have 2 paladin healers. <br />
<br />
Some specs are just outright disadvantaged when it comes to a role in some of these fights, and some can just breeze through it, and a lot of 10-man raiding guilds simply do not have the people to switch out an Arcane Mage for a Hunter, or a Holy Paladin for a resto Druid. Hence, probably why there is a percieved lenient DPS curve for 10-man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of the above is true, plus the gear disparity. Even with the same gear between 10 and 25 -- between having more gear drops per person from each boss on 25, and being a world first progression guild, Paragon has a full complement of characters in full heroic T11 gear. So they have one of every spec in great gear, without having the &quot;well-geared good player with 'wrong' spec vs. 'right' spec with less gear/experience&quot; problem that a LOT of 10-man guilds I've seen have. And the average 10-man raid is going to have less gear due to less drops per player when they did 10-man T11, and the average raid period is going to have less gear than Paragon anyway.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Yeah, 10s are probably easier on the whole, but they're not a complete roflcaekwalk compared to 25s or anything. :P</div></div><hr />

That said, strict game design and mass player environments rarely mix for any reason outside of novelty, which is clearly not good for something you're trying to tightly tune. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised to see 25-mans folded in the future, as they have quite low participation and design issues keep stacking, however Blizzard also HEAVILY buys into the status quo and could just as easily hang onto it no matter the damage it causes to the game, so who knows.</div></div><hr />

Concerning normals (I know that they are not that important for the &quot;pro&quot;s or &quot;wannabe pro&quot;s) 25m is much simpler. Simply due to the fact that the encounters are almost tuned for 18 people instead of 25. Fail as often as you want... as long as the remaining 18 are good players you will have success. In 10m you can compensate one death and even this is hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is coming from someone who has played since vanilla, but never raided regularly after BC's release...but personally, I share the sentiment but for entirely different reasons. Something most players nowadays have never experienced, or conveniently forgotten, is that nearly all endgame content prior to the onslaught of 20+ player raids in response to the complaints of a very vocal 3-5% of players came in the form of 5- to 10-mans that could be PuG'ed by a group of competent players in greens.<br />
<br />
By competent I don't mean &quot;yeah, I just solo kited the end boss when the rest of the group wiped on pull,&quot; I mean &quot;yeah, I can kite Drakk&quot;, which was the simplest role in what used to be the most technically-demanding encounter in the game*. This was prior to the random dungeon finder and cross-server dungeons, when a player could build a reputation on a given server for good (or poor) competency or conduct and as a result, groups were much more selective of who was invited to participate.<br />
<br />
The post-BC design sentiment is overwhelmingly in favor of raiding guilds. Blizzard's been all over the place with implementing that, whether it's the harshly over-tuned BC-era raids which overrode their early attempts at genuine hybridization through reinforcing class roles and &quot;raid optimization&quot; that catered to no one but the &quot;hardcore&quot; 4%, the Wrath-era in which raids were little more than loot and achievement farms, or the Cataclysm-era which to this point seems to try to find a happy medium of the two yet somehow managed to create a harsher series of gear requirements and progression climbing than what was even found in the BC era. Through it all, the common factor is that once the player (very quickly) hits maximum level, the only progression paths are to join a guild and raid, run dungeons for VP/JP, farm gold and buy gear upgrades through the AH, or participate in PvP (which still at least requires pre-made groups and PvP guilds now AFAIK). Only one of those progression paths sees genuinely new, quality content released on a regular basis, let alone sufficient content for the game to stay fresh until the next release.<br />
<br />
Personally, I wish Blizzard would dump the 20+ raid category for anything but novelty value or truly endgame encounters (the final boss of an expansion cycle or encounters with major lore characters, for example) and refocus on 5- to 10-man dungeons that focus on mechanics, coordination, and player skill above gear checking. That's the way the game was on launch, and honestly it's most engaging and enjoyable point despite its numerous flaws. As I mentioned before, Drakkisath was the most difficult encounter in the game at one point* yet a group of players in random drop greens could wipe the floor with him if they knew the encounter and their role.<br />
<br />
* Up until AQ, anyhow. Exception made for certain fake-difficulty raid encounters which utilized random attributes or mechanics that were less about being a good player than not causing a wipe by being in the wrong place at the wrong time for any reason.</div></div><hr />

Anyway this is playing at top levels. If you go 10 man, it's realistically due to shortage of players. So many times you're stuck with a bad layout or you have missing buffs, thing that is very remote in a 25man enviroment. So 10man raids are tuned to be done even with not pefect setup, otherwise you'll need to build up the perfect roster and change players everytime. Given this, some bosses are still too easy. Talking about normal modes, we came from 25 man to a couple of 10man due to summer defections. But bosses we needed entire evenings to down, in 10 man we oneshotted them. Ok, we knew the fights, but they really feel way too easy. Even with people that never seen the boss.</div></div><hr />

I edited out the majority of your post because its slightly on the wordy side, but I can't help but gather that you've completely ignored the faction grinding and/or dungeon grinding, or both to get resistance gear to even attempt raid bosses. I assume you're leaving out this significant point because you believe that if blizzard removed the &quot;20+&quot; man raids that this would not return. I have a feeling you are wrong though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They complain the DPS requirement is lower in 10 and 25, yet they are USED to running 25s! so of course it will seem lower to them!<br />
<br />
They also need to bear in mind that 10 Man content is not tuned for a specific setup because most 10 man guilds do not have multiples of classes waiting in the wings to class stack to beat the encounter.<br />
<br />
Content is not tuned just for Paragon, they should remember that.</div></div><hr />

Just compare WoL combatlogs for easier hardmode bosses and youll see that 10man fights with significantly less DPS will still take shorter. Blizzards new system ist like with T10. Easy 10mans, hard 25 mans but now we have same loot. Thanks for destroying about 75% of all 25man raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
10 man encounters not tuned for specific setup? surely 10 slots are hard to fill with specific setup but 25 man guilds surely have 4 raiding boomkins and 5 DKs.

Something most players nowadays have never experienced, or conveniently forgotten, is that nearly all endgame content prior to the onslaught of 20+ player raids in response to the complaints of a very vocal 3-5% of players came in the form of 5- to 10-mans that could be PuG'ed by a group of competent players in greens.<br />
<br />
By competent I don't mean &quot;yeah, I just solo kited the end boss when the rest of the group wiped on pull,&quot; I mean &quot;yeah, I can kite Drakk&quot;, which was the simplest role in what used to be the most technically-demanding encounter in the game*. This was prior to the random dungeon finder and cross-server dungeons, when a player could build a reputation on a given server for good (or poor) competency or conduct and as a result, groups were much more selective of who was invited to participate.<br />
<br />
The post-BC design sentiment is overwhelmingly in favor of raiding guilds. Blizzard's been all over the place with implementing that, whether it's the harshly over-tuned BC-era raids which overrode their early attempts at genuine hybridization through reinforcing class roles and &quot;raid optimization&quot; that catered to no one but the &quot;hardcore&quot; 4%, the Wrath-era in which raids were little more than loot and achievement farms, or the Cataclysm-era which to this point seems to try to find a happy medium of the two yet somehow managed to create a harsher series of gear requirements and progression climbing than what was even found in the BC era. Through it all, the common factor is that once the player (very quickly) hits maximum level, the only progression paths are to join a guild and raid, run dungeons for VP/JP, farm gold and buy gear upgrades through the AH, or participate in PvP (which still at least requires pre-made groups and PvP guilds now AFAIK). Only one of those progression paths sees genuinely new, quality content released on a regular basis, let alone sufficient content for the game to stay fresh until the next release.<br />
<br />
Personally, I wish Blizzard would dump the 20+ raid category for anything but novelty value or truly endgame encounters (the final boss of an expansion cycle or encounters with major lore characters, for example) and refocus on 5- to 10-man dungeons that focus on mechanics, coordination, and player skill above gear checking. That's the way the game was on launch, and honestly it's most engaging and enjoyable point despite its numerous flaws. As I mentioned before, Drakkisath was the most difficult encounter in the game at one point* yet a group of players in random drop greens could wipe the floor with him if they knew the encounter and their role.<br />
<br />
* Up until AQ, anyhow. Exception made for certain fake-difficulty raid encounters which utilized random attributes or mechanics that were less about being a good player than not causing a wipe by being in the wrong place at the wrong time for any reason.<br />
<br />
I hardly pay attention to the news anymore but...well goddamn said.<br />
<br />
Sidenote: This is kind of why I like Paragon. They give honest feedback on classes while also saying what can be improved about the game. They have the development teams' ear and are using it advantageously for everyone, very fucking unlike Kugen and Ensidia in previous years. I'd honestly resub if I could find the time to enjoy Paladins or Warriors like I want (Or Druids. Or Shamans).</div></div><hr />

If you are not able to have such a roster even in a 10 man guild, then you are not giving everything to be the world first guild. And to be honest stacking in 25 man is nowdays even harder then in 10 man for a semi hardcore guild, with a roster of 30 raiding members and everyone having only 1 char it's not that easy to bring 4 moonkins to your raid.</div></div><hr />

10 man are tuned because not every guild can have the almost/perfect setup for the hard modes <br />
<br />
25 are tuned on having every buff available and recourses (that's why dps on WOL is always higher on 25 versus 10 man) <br />
<br />
so... this shit again? Blizzard make next raid a 15 man one and end all 25 and 10 man and will be over of this same talking over and over and over and over .....<br />

Reported as I can only assume you are a troll based on your attitude here.<br />
<br />
Nobody ever said you needed 4 boomkins and 5 dks to get the kill in 25 man. Paragon chose that tactic and it doesn't mean the fight is tuned around it. Just as Neffy was not balanced around feral stacking to get the kill. World first guilds are racing to do anything they can to get there first.<br />
<br />
Most 10 man guilds out there doing hard modes do not have access to the resources they do. If they did have access to enough classes to class stack, they wouldn't be doing 10 man content in the first place. Also remember this tier comes after the last where it was universally agreed that 10 man HC Tier 11 was way over tuned.</div></div><hr />

The reason was described by Paragon and everyone with half a brain knows it already. Unless classes are virtual clones of each other in capability, their effectiveness per encounter will change drastically. And in a 10man where individual contribution merits much higher, the effect of raid composition is disproportional compared to 25man. If you want to raid competitively yet 10man only, you'd need about 10-14 players who all gear at least 2 possibly 3 toons through alt raids.</div></div><hr />

Hence why you'll find people on 10-man stuck on Beth'tilac because they have 2 paladin healers. <br />
<br />
Some specs are just outright disadvantaged when it comes to a role in some of these fights, and some can just breeze through it, and a lot of 10-man raiding guilds simply do not have the people to switch out an Arcane Mage for a Hunter, or a Holy Paladin for a resto Druid. Hence, probably why there is a percieved lenient DPS curve for 10-man.<br />
<br />
Sounds reasonable. Maybe the reason for lower gear/dps requirement is to give room for raid composition. This of cause doesnt applied to DREAM Paragon, the master of raid stacking.</div></div><hr />

I hope you do realize, that you can't fit every spec into a 10man group, or even every class, and expecting raiders to be on standby every raiding day while the core group is raiding. Or, having every core raider to have multiple toons available, so you can have the best class comp for each and every heroic bosses.</div></div><hr />

it's also not made up of 10 friends that decided to level to 85 together knowing what the perfect raid comp would be.<br />
<br />
All I got from that interview was that 10man and 25man are the same difficulty but if you don't have the correct raid comp for 10man you are screwed which is harder to get because if it was easy then everyone would just make a 25man guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's higher because 25-mans have more debuffs on the target (and sometimes more buffs on the players too, depending on the class setup). It's impossible for a 10m raider to archieve the same DPS as a 25m raider. <br />
<br />
Bosses in 10-man have lower HP not only because you are missing 9~11 DPSers, but because each of your 5~8 DPSers do less damage as well.</div></div><hr />

Actually, it was a comparison between Paragon and Noxa's ALTS, so Paragon have one item level higher then some 10 man alt run. <br />

A previous poster stated that a lot of 10M guilds form because it was hard to maintain a 25M roster. This is a good point; it is not easy to maintain a successful 25M raiding guild. Many 25M guilds can easily take their top ten raiders and form a 10M guild and breeze through the content as well but they choose not to because of the challenge involved in holding a 25M guild together.</div></div><hr />

I thought they were quite equal, if anything, 10m was slightly easier, however you could argue that we had shredded some &quot;scrubs&quot; from our 25 man roster when we did the 10 man version, so could just be that we had better players, but we got &quot;Can't hear you over the sound of how awesome I am&quot; on our first 10 man pull ever, after killing it in 25 a few times though.<br />
<br />
And while sinestra could possible have been a SMALL jump in difficulty ( personally I think they were on par. ), Chimaeron, Atramedes, Chimaeron, Omnitron, Maloriak, Cho'Gall, Al'Akir, Magmaw, Nefarian and Twins were all a jump down in difficulty, especially after the fixes. The only boss that I can actually give creds for being a step up would be conclave of winds, since it required a little special setup in 10 man.</div></div><hr />

They actually said all they say is from the PoV of a HARDCORE 10 man guild, where one guild of around 15 players can field 20+ raid ready chars. It's not unthinkable, there's so much downtime between tiers that all you can do is level new chars and raid on them and still have 5 more days leftover.</div></div><hr />

You cannot remove the bias of knowing the encounters before ever trying them on 10m. Honestly, it should have felt that much easier to them and they should have rolled through the 10m versions with the knowledge and practice they had. I would be curious how many wipes they have on 25m rag-H next time they down it. Their means of comparison is flawed and unfortunately there is no way they can rate the difficulty levels from an unbiased point of view. That said, to me the real meat of the article, is that if you have a large pool of raiders and toons to draw from, you can class stack to make 10m encounters easier. I would agree that this makes sense, but is only an issue for the world first chase. What this boils down to for me is that Paragon didn't like the fact that there were 10m guilds in the world first chase, which was not the case in t11, and that they are already making excuses for the next tier should they be beaten by a 10m guild. God forbid the flame war we'd see if that happened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They complain the DPS requirement is lower in 10 and 25, yet they are USED to running 25s! so of course it will seem lower to them!<br />
<br />
They also need to bear in mind that 10 Man content is not tuned for a specific setup because most 10 man guilds do not have multiples of classes waiting in the wings to class stack to beat the encounter.<br />
<br />
Content is not tuned just for Paragon, they should remember that.<br />
<br />
If you are used to running 10 or 25 you will output the exact same dps in 10 as in 25, there's no correlation here. The only reason why you'd even say that is that you think you shouldn't be as good as a player in 10 as in 25; otherwise your post makes no sense.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rutiene</div><div class="date">2011-07-26, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's not true. Your dps should lower on 10 because the probability of you being chosen by RNG elements of the fight is higher on average. Additionally, even hardcore 10mans (mine is one) have a hard time fielding 15-20 raiders. I don't even know how you'd do that. It's not like in 25, where you can rotate in 5 floaters and be OK. If you rotate in 2 people in a 10man, your strategy and execution will change dramatically. So to have the perfect raid comp with all buffs is hard to get for 10man. Usually you eat the loss of a buff for some class mechanic. Or you make the fight ridiculously hard on yourself (LOL V&amp;T or Conclave without a rogue)</div></div><hr />

Interesting. It would be kind of cool to see if Paragon could do these fights using a shammy healer, warrior tank and a rogue. Considering they are the best guild out there, wouldn't that go a long way in proving the whole, &quot;bring the player not the class&quot; theory? <br />
<br />
Or if they can't/won't then does that mean they're just very good at stacking as some have said or are they really the best? I'm not trying to knock them and I'm not a fanboi but I think it'd be something a lot of people would like to see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10 man raiders had a point in early tier 11 heroics where content was not tuned properly at first. With Firelands, tier 12 10 man normal is WIDELY known to be undertuned and from the sounds of this 10 man heroic is somewhat undertuned as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am glad that Paragon posted this; I feel their assessment of the situation was fair without belittling 10M raiding too much. I have raided both 25M and 10M and prefer raiding in a 25M environment because I find it to be more challenging. Not just in terms of content but in guild organization as well. A previous poster stated that a lot of 10M guilds form because it was hard to maintain a 25M roster. This is a good point; it is not easy to maintain a successful 25M raiding guild.

I'm a 25 man guild leader and I agree with this completely. We've fought hard to stay as 25 man despite the fact that it does take 2.5x as much work, for someone in the leadership position anyway. We could also take our 12-15 best and easily create a &quot;super 10&quot; which would allow us to progress through heroics faster. I won't do it for two reasons. 1) I would take 22 of our raiders anywhere and I hate the idea of splitting people up, we like raiding together and 2) I don't find 10 man kills thrilling. As a 40 man raider back in the day I still remember killing Rag 1.0, Nefarian 1.0 and C'thun. The energy from the was awesome. I find that 25 man kills still have a lot of thrill to them. 10 man literally feels like a 5 man boss kill to me and reminds me of clearing Strat 10 back in the day, I don't find 10 man first kills to be exciting at all.<br />
<br />
The good thing is, as more 10 man guilds pop up and more 25 man guilds disappear, we get a lot of apps these days from people who prefer 25 man raiding. My concern is larger raid sizes no longer being an option in the future because I really don't enjoy smaller raids.</div></div><hr />

Your statement doesn't make much sense? I said it is hard to maintain a consistent 25M roster hence a lot of 10M guilds form because of that. If you want to talk terms of social environment then technically that is more easily achievable in a 10M raiding guild where the environment is more tight–knit and personal. Individuals can communicate easier among one another and play off each other better in groups that are smaller as oppose to groups that are larger.</div></div><hr />

10m is about getting the perfect raidcomp, not being more difficult than 25m when you have yours ...<br />

It’s entirely subjective to each guild. I’ve lead a 25 man guild for 4 years and now a 10 man guild and it’s been much harder to maintain our 10 man guild for heroic raids than it’s ever been for 25 mans over the years. But that’s our guild issue not everyone’s. If we have 1 person sic or on holiday we can be screwed for a week if they're a healer or tank. <br />
<br />
The 10 man vs 25 is a very tiring argument. Especially as most of it is hurp a durp arguments from people just enjoying a good troll with no heroic raiding experience, 25 man heroic raiders defending their preference and others just jumping to assumptions they can't back up. Saying that as a 10 man heroic raider I do believe this current tier 12 content has been made slightly in favour of 10 mans IF those 10 mans have a perfect setup for every fight. The problem is it's completely un realistic for a 10 man guild to have a perfect setup for every fight. Gearing up is still a very big issue for 10 man heroic guilds and just to gear up well you want a roster between 12-14 players. 10 man gets 2 epics and a tier if that boss drops one, we're only 2 of 7 heroic at the moment and already our 2nd kill of Shannox we're sharding 1 item, first kill on Rhyolith sharding 1 item. Even with this 10 man content more forgiving in dps burn fights, getting the gear needed is hard work and rng for 10 mans. This reason alone is why 10 man heroic raiding can't compete with 25 man. You also can't realistically have spare alts geared up if you miss that important healer or tank class.<br />
<br />
Looking back to previous tier, there was quite a big gap in 10 man and 25 man heroic difficulties. First the heroic content was broken for some fights. We had 25 mans kiting adds on Magmaw to the Omnitron room and back again, Atramades being tanked in the doorway and everyone running out the room on the phase change. None of this was possible on 10 man. 10 man Maloriak with the adds having 500% more health than 25man, Valiona and Theralion where there was more incoming damage than 3 healers can mathematically heal. This was all fixed but it took a long time to be fixed which gave 25 man the only viable option for world firsts. There were still badly designed fights if 25 man to 10 man was meant to be close to the same. Al akir heroic was much easier on 10 man, Neff heroic had some really unfair setup requirements on 10 man. Neff p1 has more kiting options on 25 man but is fairly minor issue, p2 requires 2 interrupts per pillar, 1 main 1 backup. Very easy to have on 25 very strict setup for 10 man, this was made easier later when interrupts couldn’t miss so at least tanks were a reliable interrupt. Then p3 requires CD rotating roughly every 30 seconds (TB trinket then healer CD). Easier if you don't have a druid healing on 10 man but not impossible. Still a good fight but not balanced. <br />
<br />
In the end they finally balanced it for t11. Arguments and fan boys aside the statistics show the heroic kills favour the 25 mans. But I’m sure that really comes down to the easier gearing than the difficulty. Just to vent some frustration, in nearly 7 months of heroic tier11 never once did Chimaron drop a wand....nor the trash.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, I wouldn't get to picky on his choice of words. I'm from Europe myself and consider my English to be above average, and I very often see people choose their words because that is the only way they can express them in a correct sentence, not so much the underlying thought about choosing those words over others.<br />
<br />
Then there's the cultural aspect. Many Scandinavians use harsher (or more direct) language in day to day conversation than people from other cultures. Once literally translated to English, this may convey a harsher message than was intended.<br />
Not saying Arx' English is bad, but I wouldn't look too much into his use of condescending words.</div></div><hr />

Nowhere near harder on 25m.</div></div><hr />

Unless of course in 10 man you're missing a buff/debuff or two, an important role is assigned to you because there's less people to perform those roles, or you're targeted more often with abilities that require you to interrupt your dps because there's less people to be targeted by those abilities.<br />

<br />
My guild runs both 10 and 25, and I personally have found the 25man to be somewhat easier, though that's primarily because our comp for 10 is sub optimal and we're always missing a few buffs/debuffs. I would agree with Paragon's assessment that if you have the perfect comp for each fight, 10man is easier, but a lot of the time you don't, so the situation sort of balances itself out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are, but that's just because people think they get more loot that way :P<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just wanted to say that even though I do agree with what you're saying here, it is kind of 1 sided.<br />
The major issue 10 mans have in comparison to 25 mans is class balance. Most 10 man guilds are 10 man guilds because they're only a small group of people, they can't get 25 people together. The fights that were scaled down in comparison to 25 man were done so because not every 10 man guild can bring all the beneficial buffs to their group. Most 25 man guilds don't have this problem.<br />
<br />
The problem here lies, that if you CAN make a group that has all the buffs it needs (mostly caster based groups, so no need for all those stupid melee buffs, for example) the fights are just easier than their 25 man counterparts. <br />
<br />
I switched to 10 man raiding from 25 man raiding when cata launched due to only having a small steady group of people to play with, so we have had problems with certain fights due to lacking a certain class or spec, however this is very guild to guild specific.<br />
Then again, the room you have to make crazy strats (both positioning wise and getting specific people to do specific tasks, which both take forever in 25 mans) makes up for it on other fights.</div></div><hr />

Something most players nowadays have never experienced, or conveniently forgotten, is that nearly all endgame content prior to the onslaught of 20+ player raids in response to the complaints of a very vocal 3-5% of players came in the form of 5- to 10-mans that could be PuG'ed by a group of competent players in greens.<br />
<br />
I shortened your quote for the sake of brevity, but its in reply to the entirety. I've also been playing since vanilla, I came over during the beta from EQ and got hooked. I'm not sure we played the same game. Upon release we had 2 40 man raids and 1 10 man raid. UBRS wasn't exactly &quot;end-game content&quot;, especially considering attunement to Ony required completion of it first, and UBRS required attunement from LBRS, making a simple measure to determine progression of content. I can't recall anyone ever, at any point, claiming that UBRS was the pinnacle of raiding. I'm quite curious as to your definition of &quot;endgame content&quot;. If you define it as the place with the best loot, then that would be Ony and MC at launch. If you define it as the hardest content, again, Ony and MC. If you just use the very literal definition of the words, the end of the game, then again, that can't possibly be UBRS, because the linear path of attunement goes LBRS-&gt;UBRS-&gt;Ony. So in reality you're complaining about how people used to be able to pug mid level content, taken up in today's game by heroics. At least on my current realm people still commonly pug heroics, and Korial is pretty horrible when it comes to performance.<br />
<br />
And then you suggest that vanilla was somehow more accessible to the &quot;average&quot; player. Apparently you slept during vanilla or the heights of your raiding career was, in fact, UBRS. To raid in vanilla was to give up a large majority of your playtime to farming. You farmed rep, you farmed resist gear, you farmed consumables. I and the other raiders I knew of all spent more time farming in preparation for raiding than we usually got to spend actually raiding. And the attunement/resist requirements were a huge discouragement from new players wanting to experience raids. The only reason most people complain today is because they were never around then.<br />
<br />
Obviously the system still has faults, but what system doesn't. At the end of the day, assuming you're not one of the professional raiders, and the vast majority of us aren't, all you can care about is your own personal enjoyment. I love 10s because they let me raid with people who are only my friends. Throughout my history of raiding during WoW there was always at least 2-3 people that positively noone liked, but you had to raid with them, because that's the nature of a large group. 10 man lets me raid with only the people I want to at a time that suits me.<br />
<br />
And one thing to bear in mind regarding all of the 10 vs 25 debates. 25 man guilds can go to 10 man only at literally any point. They may choose not to due to friendships or whatnot, but the option exists. For people that play at the very cusp of the game, people who have a proven track record of using any possible advantage to acquire firsts, assuming they wouldn't run in 10s when that's a definitive way to get to first is just naive. Apparently you are of the belief that top guilds will class stack, realm/faction change, and exploit, but they're not willing to bench 15 people to get to be number 1.</div></div><hr />

That seems to be the thing to do these days. Obviously that means Prot Warriors are worthless as tanks, because an ultra-competitive guild who has to eke out every tiny bit of performance to make world first kills as soon as possible, without the assumed gear that the fights expect you to have, chose to use a Bear and Pally on all the kills? Obviously Bears/Pallys are the ideal tanking combination because Paragon uses them, right? Should I just go back to my Pally?</div></div><hr />

It's so far removed from my reality of WoW (I was in a guild full of doctors and grad students who killed Lich King 10M normal in August of 2010 after working on it for 5 months), that I have to read their post a few times just to understand what they are trying to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunate...&quot;<br />
&quot;Hand you've been dealt...&quot;<br />
&quot;Too easy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Basically from down here in our perspective, we would have to ruin our lives as we know them, and our guild, just to approach a level of mediocrity that a world-first guild feels kind of sorry for. That might even sound offensive or demeaning, except that it's so far removed from our reality that it's totally irrelevant. <br />
<br />
It's like I play football, and Paragon/Dream plays football on flying unicorns, and periodically report on their experiences.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's entirely valid to directly compare US and EU guild progress, as the conditions under which people play are quite different. <br />
<br />
US internet infrastructure is....well...business (what's the best that it needs to perform in order to max profit/reduce costs? and that under near monopoly conditions...). People are also far more likely to be near the server location in EU countries (since they are geographically much smaller than the US). <br />
<br />
If your average ping is under 20ms, you are going to perform far better than if your ping is 300+, that's just a given. So while their comments may seem to be over trivializing the encounter to such an extent that it's offensive to some people, it could also be the case that the encounters are in fact far less demanding for them due to factors that have nothing at all to do with raid experience, composition, or strategy. On the other end of the spectrum, I'm not trying to downplay their success either (after all no other EU guild has killed everything yet either), I'm just saying that people aren't looking at the whole picture if they pretend that connection/server quality differences don't exist either.</div></div><hr />

They're doing it in mostly T11 Heroic gear with a few T12 pieces. Top geared in the world (not Paragon) are only at around 384 ilevel.</div></div><hr />

1 guild in the world not bringing a shammy does not mean every shammy in the world now has to re-roll. They were aiming for a world first kill(which is usually done with gear from the previous tier)so they took a comp that suited them the most.</div></div><hr />

No they're not. Did you even armory the people they use? They average 380-384. So basically if you are at or above the gear level that the bosses are tuned to (for example H Baleroc 10 is tuned for ilvl 380), the boss becomes easier than when you were doing it undergeared when they were trying Heroic 25s.<br />
<br />
And then they have the audacity to cry that 10 mans are easier?<br />
<br />
Surprise! When you are geared for and have the strats for a boss, the boss becomes easier than when you are reconning him undergeared. Holy smokes man, alert the media.</div></div><hr />

Gear will fix that. <br />
<br />
They have the same problems in 25 man raids. If you watched their video of Ragnaros or their live stream raid you know they HAVE TO switch classes in and out or they won't kill him. <br />
There are plenty of 25 man guilds who don't have the resources to switch out their shamans for hardmodes because they are subpar. So tell me what's the difference? (Paragon isn't going to kill Ragnaros, and maybe other bosses, with 2-3 resto shamans either in 25 man at the moment).<br />
<br />
It was stupid to try to make 10 mans equal to 25 mans because it's impossible. It's a totally different scene and it should stay like that and you should just play what you want to play and not complain. I really don't understand why 10 mans MUST HAVE the same gear and achievements as 25 mans. Just accept and agree that they are different raids. If you really have the feeling that you want the gear from 25 mans then you don't like 10 mans enough anyway.<br />

Another good example of someone ignoring the facts and not even listening properly to what Paragon actually said about this. They didn't &quot;cry&quot; that 10 mans are easier just to annoy you. They tested 10 man hardmodes to see if they should switch to 10 mans. If they were harder they would have because they want to progress on the hardest content there is. <br />
<br />
I am a big enough man to admit it when 10 mans are harder. But from experience and no proof, and now that the best guild in the world has tested it, I really don't think 10 mans are harder or even equal.<br />
<br />
And seriously those few items aren't going to make that much of a difference. And I just watched their live raid and they are still struggling on Ragnaros 25 man with that gear you are talking about.<br />

It does mean they are very underpowered. The guy that gets interviewed during their live raid also stated that shamans are very very bad and bring nothing to the raid not even one spec. Even after having killed raganaros twice (or more?) on hardmode they still have to kick out their 1 shaman because they otherwise won't be able to kill him.<br />
<br />
It's impossible to tune classes how blizzard wants them to be.</div></div><hr />

Which explains why there's only been maybe 2(?) true 10man guilds in the world that has killed heroic Ragnaros 10 while every other H Rags kill was done by a 25 man who could pretend that a 2 frost DK 2 hunter 3 paladin setup was a normal raid group?</div></div><hr />
