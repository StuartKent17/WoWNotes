Ok I'll say it, Blizzcon didn't really teach us anything new on the WoW side this year. We had a couple of juicy bits of lore and some information on the Firelands raid but that's it. Tomorrow will have a lot of Q&amp;A and the Cinematics panel, considering that they already released the Goblin and the Cataclysm cinematic I guess you will see the Worgen video there. It will be followed by two sessions of Q&amp;A and the World of Warcraft Art panel.

The guy is supposed to be Zul'jin, the girl next to the T8 priest won 3rd place, is Ysera. Second Place was the skinniest Illidan ever, and is not pictured, first place as mentioned is a D3 female monk, not pictured either. (The 2nd to last lady had an amusing costume concept, &quot;Lady Vashj goes to Vegas&quot; )<br />
<br />
I did take a screencap of 3 of the finalist, D3 Monk Jaina &amp; D3 Witchdoctor, but since I signed up just to post here I can't give a link :P</div></div><hr />

I'm a woman at rl and would love if my wow character could wear high heels like the demon huntress does ^^ Don't like that women's costumes at all and the girl pretending to be Alextrasza seems anorexic imo.<br />

Omg, the woman in pic number 18 (that one wearing a blue dress)... she's not like an ingame female bloodelf, is she? xDDD In fact, she's like 10 of them at the same time.<br />

Because, aside from the girls who only play WoW because of their bfs/husbands (and maybe even including them), a lot of them play not just because it`s fun or that they`re good at an easy game (obviously a game with 12 million+ people isn`t played because it`s hard), they`re also attention *Wordhere*. I mean I`d rather look at something someone creatively made like the boomkin, than look at someone who threw on a skanky blood elf costuem and decided to wear it at blizzcon. *shrugs* just me, maybe.</div></div><hr />

I say that either Professor Putricide + Rotface (http://img839.imageshack.us/f/profputriciderotface.png/), the Priest T8, Arthas + Marwyn + Falric (http://img266.imageshack.us/f/arthascaptains.png/), or the first Spirit Healer (http://img37.imageshack.us/f/spirithealer.png/) should have won.

Some beautiful girls were up there yesterday, and RikuKitty I was honestly disappointed that you didn't qualify for the top 5 (the other Alexstrasza, as well). Not that being hot should land you in the top ten, because after all this is a COSTUME contest, not a wet t-shirt contest, but the people knocking your looks are being ridiculous.<br />

Your costume looks really nice.

What makes you think this isn't her natural body type? People aren't all the same. Assuming she has no medical problems regarding her weight (which we don't even know the number), suggesting someone needs to fatten up for aesthetic reasons is just as patronizing as telling another (assuming) healthy woman she needs to cut the calories simply because she doesn't fit the extremely rigid ideal concept that individual people have.<br />

To all the people who competed in the costume contest, fantastic job, well done to you all. I wish I had half as much guts as you guys must have to get out there and show your love for this game in front of everyone. While the rest of us sit here and comment from the sidelines you guys are out there doing something cool. I love a line I heard from Day9 on his starcraft blog - &quot;There is nothing cooler than being proud of the things you love&quot; and you guys epitomise that.

I said they have the looks to pull it off (very-very pretty), I said the costume looks great, I just suggested they get some more curves to be spot onto what they're trying to emulate. Cosplayers, at least ones I know, will go to the lengths of even manipulating their bodies to complete the look.<br />
<br />
And no, women need to work out just like men. The ones that just don't eat (not properly even), and don't work out that are skinny look sickly. They need to work out to tone up their muscles just like men do, except they go a curvy-tone, not a veiny-bulk-tone that men strive for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as &quot;Alexstrasza&quot;...which one? There've been at least a half dozen in the last two Blizzcons. There were probably also a lot of turned ankles this year because of the many draenei/protoss costumes featuring simulated hooves.

Here here! Thank you for saying that because the feminist attitude portrayed by some female players especially some of the questions at the Q&amp;A's does not at all represent all female players. Likewise it does not represent all feminists that play either. From reading through the comments I noticed that some male players have commented on the unrealistic look of male models - it's a game, neither is accurate to real life. And to be honest, I'd rather the art department and development team concentrate on bringing us awesome new things than worry about making the NPCs/characters fatter or with smaller boobs. One thing I noticed from watching all the Q&amp;A pannels is that so many players don't realise just how long Blizzard's 'to do' list for WoW really is. They can't do everything, and even they must get frustrated when they realise they cannot do things they would love to do.</div></div><hr />

Although the costume didn't turn out as well as we'd hoped, at least I'm out there doing something. You can say all you want but, but at least I gave it a shot. I also threw that together in one day. The costume sort of started to fall apart after being in it for 8 hours. To my credit it looked A LOT better in the darker lighting of the convention as opposed to where the picture was taken. The latex body paint didn't mesh well with the cream based hands/feet in the lighting.<br />
<br />
I've already started on next years so hopefully it won't suck as bad lol. I'll be the warrior with a disarmed debuff over my head, so if you still got a problem or want to talk about me looking gay you can come do it to my face.<br />
<br />

Second, at least in my case, I was attempting to make my costume as accurate as possible. Unfortunately, blizzard's outfits only seem to fit as they should in a gravity-less world. I was planning on remaking the bottoms, but my costume was finished at 630am the day of blizzcon.<br />
<br />
By all means, I did not expect everyone to be friendly about it, but I put a lot of hard work into it and I hope people can overlook the unfortunate flaw of one piece.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of you, thanks for the compliments as mildly disturbing as some of them are.<br />
<br />
I thought your costume was rather impressive. I'm sure it took a lot of effort and time - heck any of those costumes did. And they probably have more courage than most here to even wear it out to Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
My gf and I were actually behind you in line for pictures on the Frozen Throne. To be honest, I felt a little bad for you - it looked like some meathead was giving you a hardtime partway through the lineup. We both laughed when he finally got the hint and left (gave us some evil looks though.) We wanted to say something afterwards but figured you had enough people poking you.</div></div><hr />

At chemgear: Yeah, he said he was a Blizzard employee and wanted to take me to a exclusive after party. I wasn't really interested. He was clearly intoxicated. Rofl, an instant more of trying to fondle my waist and my guildies would have jumped him. :D Glad you found it amusing, though, I definitely got some laughs out of it.</div></div><hr />
