Patch 4.2 Models - Fandral Staghelm (Fire Cat) 
Today we have yet another model from Patch 4.2, the Fire Cat form of Fandral Staghelm! If you saw the Firelands Raid Preview posted a few weeks ago you already know that Fandral will be linked to one of the encounter in the Firelands, and he got a new model for the occasion.

Patch 4.2 Models - Fandral Staghelm (Fire Cat)<br />
Today we have yet another model from Patch 4.2, the Fire Cat form of Fandral Staghelm! If you saw the Firelands Raid Preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2203-Firelands-Raid-Preview-Reckful-3-PvP-Video-Blizzard-Retrospective-Video) posted a few weeks ago you already know that Fandral will be linked to one of the encounter in the Firelands, and he got a new model for the occasion. <br />

<br />
I'm also reposting the new model of our good friend Ragnaros, a couple of people contacted me to get a nice photoshoppable version of my original screenshot so I did one with more angles than you could wish for and removed the watermarks. Please just promise me that you won't hurt his pride too much. <br />

Remote Guild Chat Feedback and Bugs<br />
As you might have seen ( http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2653949#blog ), we recently rolled out an update to our iPhone and iPod touch Mobile Armory app that adds the ability to chat with your guild mates directly from your mobile device. We wanted to make sure we have a consolidated place where you can report bugs and offer us feedback on the features after trying Remote Guild Chat during the free preview period.<br />
<br />
Before posting, here’s some info on a couple of the hot topics we’ve seen:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
An update to the Android Remote Auction House app is scheduled to come out in the next few days that’ll grant access to guild chat. We know you want it; it’s coming real soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Realms are being rolled out in stages, and our goal is to make the feature available on all realms within roughly a week’s time. If your realm isn’t available, please hang tight. It won’t be long.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have the app and have been able to try guild chat on the currently supported realms, let us know what you think: Have you run into any issues? Any bugs you’ve been able to reproduce? What about the feature itself -- how do you like it? Any thoughts on how we can make it better?<br />
<br />

Making the Scene<br />
The goblin mail cannons recently &quot;delivered&quot; Issue 4 of the World of Warcraft Official Magazine to subscribers, or at least to their general vicinity. Did you get your copy? If not, what are you waiting for? If you subscribe today you can get articles like this exclusive interview with the Blizzard Entertainment cinematics team, along with much more. Check out the excerpt below for a taste of what you're missing.<br />
<br />
Participants:<br />
<br />
Jeff Chamberlain – Cinematic Projects Lead<br />
Marc Messenger – Cinematics Project Director<br />
Fausto De Martini – Cinematics 3D Art Director<br />
Chris Thunig – Cinematic 2D Art Director<br />
Jonathan Berube – Cinematic VFX Art Director<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Official Magazine: Blizzard cinematics have a distinctive look, but all of you probably have your own personal influences. What has influenced your work?<br />
<br />
Fausto: I can say that for a lot of us, movies are a huge influence.<br />
<br />
Jeff: Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, anything sci-fi or fantasy. We all dig that a lot.<br />
<br />
Fausto: Aliens. Blade Runner.<br />
<br />
Jonathan: Definitely, more recently, Avatar -- because they use a similar pipeline as we do. So it shows you what someone else is capable of doing with the same tools you have in your hand. And when you see it, you're like, &quot;OK, what are the differences here? How many people do they have? Do they have more budget? Different ways of approaching it? What is it?&quot; That always makes more of a ripple effect than the other movies you get to watch more as a spectator enjoying the finished product.<br />
<br />
Chris: Besides that, influence is really everywhere, right? I mean, we see it on trips, we look at the classical paintings. We go out and shoot whatever it is that we need to wrap our heads around. A lot of us grew up with pop-culture influences, obviously, but we really want to look at any type of inspiration out there and just take it all in.<br />
<br />
Marc: One of the challenges with some of the effects on Cataclysm was that we didn't have a whole lot of frame of reference for what things should look like. What does the sky look like when it’s completely full of fire? What does a dam breaking a giant head with all this water coming out of it look like? Where are we supposed to go on YouTube and find a video of that? There was a lot of research and development to try to figure out what that should really look like. One of the hardest shots in there is the shot where we pull out and the three battering rams are all coming in and pounding on Deathwing. Then the hand comes out covered in lava and slams down and all the rocks go flying, and then we pull back and all this smoke is rising up around Deathwing's head. I think everybody in this room and practically everybody on our team had a hand in that shot because it was such a big deal. It was such a big camera move and encompassed so many different things happening. I think for that reason it stands out in my mind as one of the most successful shots that we did, because it was truly a team effort.<br />
<br />

From Left to Right: Fausto De Martini, Chris Thunig, Marc Messenger, Jeff Chamberlain, and Jonathan Berube<br />
<br />
<br />
Jonathan: I get a lot of inspiration from the Navy, funnily enough. I think they have some of the most sophisticated design. It's because the Navy is a business, right? And they have a very precise task. All of the design around any engineering they do is to fulfill a goal. There's no sort of artistic input in any of their design -- or very little. It's just forms full of function. To me, that's such a strong visual language because you look at a piece and know exactly what it does. Sometimes, as we design something, we try to just make it look cool. And then sometimes, it's hard to make it read well in terms of what it's going to do. I have a whole new sort of respect for the designers and engineers from the Navy or anyone who's a transportation designer... people who design cars or a car dashboard, the whole functionality behind forms and the layout of how things are placed.<br />
<br />
Chris: Goes with the principle of not designing out of thin air, right? Having something to base your ideas on, something that people will recognize in some way, shape, or form.<br />
<br />
Fausto: Yeah. The challenge for us is always combining that to make something memorable. You want to make sure whatever you're doing, especially for the main character, is something that's going to have a memorable, powerful silhouette. It’s like, &quot;OK, that's Kerrigan.&quot; So combining and balancing all those elements is the challenge we always have in front of us.<br />
<br />
Jonathan: Yeah. Designing something that has a lot of character in its appearance or the details reveals more and more information about the personality behind it. That's always very fun. Every time you add an item on a character or adjust a layout on a film set, it's like asking, &quot;Who lives here? Are they tall? Are they short? Who made Deepholm? Was this a thousand years ago? If they crafted these crystal combs, what tools did they use? What were their resources? How tall were they? How big were they?&quot; It's a study of who's responsible for this -- because that's not me. I'm not the engineer here. I don't live here. I'’s these people, and how can you make any item recognizable in terms of who drives it or lives in it?<br />
<br />
Jeff: There are so many great artists at Blizzard, any time you get artwork from another team, it's just so inspirational. You get a 2D illustration of the new Diablo or something, and you're just like, &quot;We can't wait to build that, to tell that story.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jonathan: One of my biggest inspirations, funnily enough, is the game. I don't play the game at all. I had never played World of Warcraft until I had to make a character when Derrick Simmons, an ex-producer, came and gave me the CDs for World of Warcraft. I was getting coffee in the morning and I didn't know how to name my troll priest, so I named him Konablend because that was the type of coffee I drank every day. Every time I played the game, I wouldn't actually play the game. I would just look around and say, &quot;I get it. Now I want to see the movie version.&quot; And there goes the cinematic.<br />
<br />
When we go to a movie theater and we see the photorealism, it's such a deep visual language, and there's an insane amount of detail, but the ideas are sometimes not that cool. In the game, you see these crazy layouts and scenery and the ideas are really, really cool. We take that and deliver it in a language that people see every day. That, to me, is the reason why I’m in cinematics. I don’t play the game, but I watch people play. I don’t want to be a tauren; I just want to go have a Coors Light while sitting on my siege tank. I want to see that and take a group photo of my character with a siege tank. To me, that's the dream.<br />

Glyph of Greater Proportion &gt; Glyph of Lesser Proportion<br />
That was actually an error in the patch notes. The new glyph decreases pet size slightly:<br />
<br />
Glyph of Mend Pet is now Glyph of Lesser Proportion, which decreases the size of the pet slightly. <br />
<br />
[...] The patch note collection process is an interesting one. When wormholes and such are involved, it's no surprise that a note could come out with the exact opposite meaning.<br />
<br />
I get a headache every time someone even asks me about patch notes, potentially because I quantum leaped into this body the moment prior to the question. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/170671/41-is-the-end-of-happiness))<br />

<br />
This!<br />
<br />
I would bu that from the blizzard...well I probably wouldn't, I would probably come here and QQ that it was another mount in the store :P. But by far the most epic cat model ever in the game<br />
<br />
Also, the comic is very funny.<br />
<br />
edit: that cat model is going to be a form of a druid, why cant druid cat / bears ( and to a lesser extent moonkin) forms have armor?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Avatar had a $400 million budget and even at that price, Jim Cameron managed to produce 180 minutes of solid CGI content with full motion capture and facial capture (or about $2 million per minute), whereas Blizzard spends $100 million a year for 10 minutes of CGI content across WoW (2 minutes) and Starcraft (8 minutes) at about $10 million per minute. For a more direct comparison, Pixar puts out 90 minutes of high quality CGI per year at about $100 million ($1.1 million per minute). Sounds like the Blizzard cinematics department is not doing their job properly.<br />
<br />
Blur Studios which does CGI intros and cutscenes for almost every other non-Blizzard game puts out hours of CGI per year at far less budget and similar quality levels. They even found time to make a 45 minute Assassin's Creed movie and are doing all the cutscenes for SW TOR.</div></div><hr />

That's called a Black war bear and A Black War Wolf, i dont see armor ever happening for druid forms come to think of it i think there was a blue post saying no a few months back cant find it but it was pre new forums so its probably gone forever :(<br />

Also they just re-made the forms that's a lot of money/man hours to just throw away for armor, that not everyone cares about or would like. There are way better places to spend money and time atm.<br />

<br />
Fandral Staghelm on Wowpedia (http://www.wowpedia.org/Fandral_Staghelm)<br />
<br />
From quests in Mount Hyjal it is revealed that Fandral is placed in a prison in Mount Hyjal, and this is shortly realized to be a bad idea, because of the immense power he possesses, cultists will be after him, to try and use him for their own devices. The player embarks on a quest to transfer him to a prison in Moonglade where the powerful Arch Druid remains until his mind can be regained, or for eternity. <br />
<br />
I'm betting the new quests in Hyjal in 4.2 will shed light on this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that the fire cat model is amazing. <br />
<br />
But the real question is, why is Fandral presened in cat form???<br />
<br />
It would be nice to fight him in certain phase when he shapeshifts into this cat. But it will be strange to fight the former powerful blance archdruid only as a cat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I'm sorry, but why the hell would I want my pet to be SMALLER? What the hell Blizzard? I was looking forward to having an epic looking, badass and big Loque'nahak. Now you fuck it up for us and tell us that you made a stupid typo, breaking the hearts of hunters everywhere? <br />
<br />
I'm being serious when I say that I swear to god, Blizzard have it in for hunters. Warlocks get demons with genders? How the hell does that make any sense? Last time I checked, demons don't even have genders and shouldn't have. If anything it's hunters that should have pet genders, that would at least make sense. But they wouldn't do that. And why? Because they just get rid of all the nice and fun little vanity things that hunters have. Pet loyalty levels, Eyes of the Beast, for example. And now pet happiness too. I don't understand it. Everything that makes hunters and their pets unique is now gone. They gave us more pet spaces for collectors like myself but that was probably the only good thing, so that now we can have more of these soulless creatures in our stables. <br />
<br />
So, as I said, they get rid of everything unique to hunter pets and plan to give warlock pets genders. <br />
<br />
Coming in Patch 4.2? Hunters no longer have the ability to name their pets and their names will be randomly selected when tamed.<br />
<br />
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if that happened.<br />
<br />
Sorry for ranting on a good bit there, I never usually do it. But this one little blue post has opened my eyes to how I think they feel about my class.</div></div><hr />

They haven't &quot;just&quot; changed it,,,,.. <br />
what i meant was whilst they were redesigning the models, one of the most requested ideas was armour strapped to our forms.. so we have some distinction between a lvl 20 kitty and an lvl 85 if they were stood right next to each other,, and yes not everyone wants it but most do.. personally if its too much messing around to have diffident tiers showing then id love to see a minor glyph to change the appearance to include armour so that way people like yourselves aren't forced to see it :)<br />

<br />
Fandral was a regular ol' Night Elf druid. Arch druid. His involvement with the Nightmare constituted a perversion of the druidic arts, but was something still rooted (pun intended) in nature magic. If anything, Fandral - the fugitive - should be infused with this foul, shadowy essence, not fire. This reeks of the designers saying &quot;well, it's Firelands... everything needs to be fire-themed, so let's make him a flaming cat!&quot; Or perhaps going so far as to tack on a limp-wristed lore explanation of &quot;he's sworn fealty to Ragnaros, so... yeah, fire!&quot;<br />
<br />
Even Richard Knaak handled this character with more continuity and respect than what 'fire kitty' is hinting at now. UGH.</div></div><hr />

I think the rest of the raid agrees with me if i say: &quot;Don't give hunters a fire cat to tame, because the effects are beyond annoying if we have to look at them all the time&quot;!</div></div><hr />

That model is so hot! (lmao, I didn't catch that terrible pun until the end of my post. -_-) I want my ugly kitty to be that cool looking, or for that matter, my Boomkin. Blizzard is out of ideas my ass, they're just too lazy to implement more awesome. Now give me a water kitty! Or a nature kitty..ooo I want a nature kitty.

I actually like the encounter design this hints at. Cat form with heavy bleed and fire damage for the whole raid, Fandral jumping from person to person, lots of DoTs. Bear form with heavy tank damage, mutiple tanks to soak damage, perhaps an &quot;armor breaking&quot; mechanic to mitigate bear forms high armor. Balance/resto form with fire versions of balance spells and burning treant adds to control as well as trying to outdps his heals. Timed phases for the feral forms with hp% triggers putting him into resto/balance form. Ah, the possibilities of enhounter design when using a druid boss.</div></div><hr />

Not true, they bitched about the firehawks using the proto-drake skeleton.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stupid models are stupid. Firehawks are not bat dragons and shouldn't have flaming wings that bend at 90 degree angles OF FIRE to crawl like bats. That's why that was complained about.<br />
<br />
Overfiends have crap models because that model has always looked absolutely retarded when it walked. Like someone who was drunk with scoliosis about to fall over backwards but never quite making it so it's stuck in this constant state of retardation.<br />
<br />
The skins are kickass. The models blow.<br />
<br />
Kitty, though? The model is cool, the skin is cool.<br />
<br />
EDIT: You can replace all 'model' references with 'skeleton'. Been playing with too many toolsets.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unkn0wnerr0r</div><div class="date">2011-04-22, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Avatar had a $400 million budget and even at that price, Jim Cameron managed to produce 180 minutes of solid CGI content with full motion capture and facial capture (or about $2 million per minute), whereas Blizzard spends $100 million a year for 10 minutes of CGI content across WoW (2 minutes) and Starcraft (8 minutes) at about $10 million per minute. For a more direct comparison, Pixar puts out 90 minutes of high quality CGI per year at about $100 million ($1.1 million per minute). Sounds like the Blizzard cinematics department is not doing their job properly.<br />
<br />
Blur Studios which does CGI intros and cutscenes for almost every other non-Blizzard game puts out hours of CGI per year at far less budget and similar quality levels. They even found time to make a 45 minute Assassin's Creed movie and are doing all the cutscenes for SW TOR.<br />
<br />
http://vz2.blur.com/<br />
<br />
First I love that their main page has the Star Wars The Old Republic on it, because that short video is better than many of the recent movies I have seen. Blur is amazing, they do so great work. I know that Blizzard isn't, and can never be Blur Studios. I kind of wonder how much better they could do if they weren't using a prehistoric engine. When is blizz going to wake up and check the date. Free to play games left them behind in graphics. For people who say &quot;graphics aren't everything&quot; then why aren't you reading a book? In fact why not just play a mud, nothing but text since graphics don't matter. What they mean is that graphics don't matter if your graphics are worse than the other guys.</div></div><hr />
