<br />
<br />
Order Hall Followers and Missions<br />
Some additional thoughts on the concerns that have been raised in this and other threads, loosely paraphrased:<br />
<br />
Don't you understand that no one likes missions? Why are you keeping any piece of the system?<br />
<br />
We understand that many players are unhappy with garrisons, and in particular with the prominence of follower missions in Warlords of Draenor. We're certainly not sitting around, saying to ourselves, &quot;Wow, everyone loves managing followers and doing missions; let's just copy/paste this feature into our next expansion for an easy win!&quot;<br />
<br />
We agree that, especially in the long run, the balance of content and rewards between garrison missions and core world content was a big problem in Draenor. Players too often found themselves without much reason to bother with dungeons or outdoor content, possibly logging on to raid or PvP, and otherwise just checking in to collect mission rewards and send followers out on new ones. And after a little while of that, it's awfully easy for it to stop feeling like a proper MMO experience.<br />
<br />
We've tried to tackle this problem throughout our design of Legion. We've focused on replayable and varied outdoor world content and dungeon content as the heart and soul of the Legion endgame, and on reward systems that will support the continued relevance of those systems. <br />
<br />
But at the same time, there are people who do enjoy the mission minigame, and there are some positive elements, such as a bit of offline progression, and the fun of looking forward to a reward waiting for you when you get home and log in. Not all aspects of the game are intended to appeal to all players - that's part of the challenge of creating a single game that is played by such a diverse audience with different preferences and playstyles. But while garrison followers and missions were a substantial portion of the content in Warlords, Order Hall missions are probably more like 3% of Legion.<br />
<br />
I understand that there is a fair amount of cynicism, and there are some who are probably reading this right now and thinking that it's just a bunch of nice-sounding words trying to cover up our sinister plan of mission-table supremacy. But even if we wanted to, we know that we canâ€™t hide anything here. Well before Legion is in anyone's hands, people will be experiencing the system in its entirety in beta, and we'll be judged on that basis.<br />
<br />
But there's key player power at the bottom of my Order Hall tech tree, so isn't that gated behind missions?<br />
<br />
Actually, no. As I mentioned in my post in the Alpha forums, what players are seeing in Alpha right now lacks context, admittedly because we haven't provided much. The research you can initiate in your Order Hall to unlock various perks, culminating in a strong player-power reward, requires Order Resources. Order Resources are not in any way gained through missions. You gain Order Resources from quest content: from the one-time Order Campaign quest arc, from treasures around the world, and at max level from outdoor world quests. If anything, missions are more likely to serve as an outlet for excess Resources once you have your research needs covered.<br />
<br />
The Order Hall campaign immediately has you do missions that take a day to complete. That sounds terrible.<br />
<br />
That's good feedback, and definitely the sort of thing we may adjust. Let me try to explain the intent here: The core of the class Order campaigns is epic quest content that is custom to your class. If you're a Death Knight, you might be working to raise a new set of Four Horsemen who are powerful enough to stand against the Legion; as a Mage, you may be investigating a plot that threatens to undo Dalaran from within; and so forth. That's what the Order campaigns are. We start you on these chains during the level-up experience, but they're intended to be a story that unfolds over time, complementing the game's level-up and endgame progression. <br />
<br />
In Warlords, when we had the Garrison campaign quests, we presented a new one each week, but there was no real indication where the next step would come from, or how long you would have to wait in order to continue. This time around, we want to avoid having gaps where there's no quest in your log. Having occasional steps where we ask you to run a few missions with long completion times seemed like a more elegant way to do that, allowing us to weave in a bit of storytelling, as opposed to just &quot;hey, come back next week for the next step.&quot; <br />
<br />
I understand that most of the discussion is based on bits of information that emerge from the Alpha, and I know that it's difficult to truly reassure you when you haven't yet seen the things I'm talking about firsthand. But hopefully trying to share our goals and philosophies, as well as acknowledging past missteps (we hear you - really!), can provide some guidance about where this system is going to end up when it's complete.<br />

Plate and Mail in Legion<br />
Bricksteel Gauntlets - a quest reward that I had to grind Timbermaw rep to get (the only gloves in that style/color in the game).<br />
Thank you for the report. As a result of this post we uncovered a bug in our data conversion that had been a little too aggressive. These items, and other level 40+ Mail items that were erroneously changed to Plate, will be reverted in a future build.

<br />
FEEDBACK: Mythic/Mythic+ Dungeons<br />
Bolster in its current state where it effects boss encounter adds is a little bit more situational but leads to the same problem in fights where there is no way to avoid killing the adds to progress/survive the encounter. The most obvious examples of this are Helya and Cordana.<br />
The fact that it affected things like Flames of Woe and Stormforged Obliterators was actually a bug. They should be considered part of the boss encounter and be exempt. While it was possible to handle Bolster on them, as you note, there are other encounters where it would be entirely broken.

Will Internal bleeding apply to stun immune mobs in Legion? Will it's damage increase with Deeper Stratagem?<br />
No, it will not apply to stun-immune targets. However, Deeper Stratagem will increase it's potential damage. https://t.co/IkQwA0usll (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/717862937684082688))<br />

PvE<br />
Are rare mobs subject to scaling while leveling in Legion, or are they static?<br />
The rare mobs you meet while levelling will scale with you. Separate max-level rares and rare elites exist as well. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/717861230392639488))<br />
when killing a level 102 mob, a level 110 player stopped to help. Mob appeared to scale to highest player's level. Y/N ?<br />
Mob doesn't change level or stats, the damage and mob health numbers just display differently based on your lvl (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/717867328273125377))<br />
So you shouldn't see a damage decrease when other players hop in, unless the mob was using an ability. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/717867492878585856))<br />

Do you need lvl 110 to finish the questline for Blacksmithing. My quest stopped at quenching.<br />
Yep! The questline will continue once you reach level 110. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/717863183633895424))<br />

Speaking of professions, will BS be getting a new key? WoD didn't have one, so Leystone Skeleton Key for 5 or 10 bars?<br />

Like when you send your champions on missions, there is a 50% chance for a quest to pop up regarding the mission you just sent, like, they were captured and needs help, and you as the leader must choose, send reinforcements which will give you the base rewards or personally take care of the problem and get extra rewards. You can also tie in some long quest line to this concept. Basically, make it more involving for us. Make it so that we're not just gonna click &quot;send followers&quot; and wait, although a little of that is still ok for me, but more on actually doing the quest yourself.<br />
<br />
Also, regarding the Order Hall upgrades. why not make it like Far Cry Primal. Where there are stuff in your Order Hall that can be upgraded, but the materials that you need to upgrade them can be found somewhere. Example is, Follower Cap Increase upgrade. you need beds, which needs wood and cloth, you need to gather like 100 wood and 200 cloth top increase the cap by 5. For some upgrades, you need a special item that can only drop from bosses and stuff like that.</div></div><hr />

So it's just displayed differently based an level... so a mob at level 100 has e.g 60k life, for 110 it would be displayed as 100k?<br />

Great design but the Windsteed/Warforged Nightmare bounding animation gets a groan. If the model stay in-game I'll still get whichever version/versions becomes available to add to the collection but no plans to ride them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, mobs scale to your level, but you'll earn new gear which makes killing mobs faster, even while leveling. A level 110 player decked in raid gear will kill faster, a level 102 player who just dinged will kill mobs a lot slower than a level 102 player at 70% with gear earned for his level. Mobs will get stronger per level you earn, but at the same time become increasingly easier/faster to kill as you progress through that level.<br />

<br />
No shit? In fact if you take the amount of people constantly bitching about missions on these forums, let's say 2-3000 people? Heck, it's prbably even less, and let's call the rest of them content. Not happy, not hating, content. Then you could pretty much flip that number up side down. I know you want to think everyone hates these things but believe me, you couldn't be further from the truth. <br />
<br />
I couldn't care less about missions, I do them when I have the time and I'm around, but there's a very fine line between being ok with it and hating it. I'm willing to bet my ass well over half the player's don't mind the return of missions, especially in a lightweight form. Don't honestly think a lot of them are actively celebrating it however.</div></div><hr />

A level 110 player decked in raid gear will kill faster, a level 102 player who just dinged will kill mobs a lot slower than a level 102 player at 70% with gear earned for his level. Mobs will get stronger per level you earn, but at the same time become increasingly easier/faster to kill as you progress through that level.<br />

Is that not the opposite of what the tweet states? They explicitly said: <br />
Mob doesn't change level or stats, the damage and mob health numbers just display differently based on your lvl</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sure ain't just 1% who enjoys those aspects of missions he mentions, like offline progression and being able to spend excess resources on tangible rewards, <br />
but the fact that together with the other screw-ups of WoD (that he also addresses in the post) caused missions to be pretty much the most rewarding non-raid &quot;activity&quot; in WoD. So of course people overall &quot;hate&quot; them, but it's just a symptom. <br />
<br />
I'm not judging Legion and Order Halls missions before I can get a feel of the whole, but people who are raging about alpha info aren't helping anyone. I &quot;hate&quot; how missions turned out in WoD because currently that is the ONLY thing I do. Because nothing else feels compelling or rewarding</div></div><hr />

Well I can only tell you what I see for myself in the beta. Mobs have a fixed amount of HP for their level, I do more damage as my gear gets better, hence I hit mobs for a larger % of total HP. As I level up, mobs get more HP, I hit for less %, but as I again get better gear I start hitting harder again. So the sense of progression is there for sure.<br />
<br />
How the scaling works in technical terms, that I can't tell you. I can however tell you that mob level definitely increases with your own. Mobs in Azsuna are level 101 on one char, and 107 on the one I use the most.</div></div><hr />

Okay, I understand that gear is a factor in the killing time, but why did they say the difference is only in display not in stats?<br />
That sounds to me, as if your level (not item level) is completly irrelevant to the damage you are doing. So why have the 10 level increase if you do basicly the same amout of damage the entire time?</div></div><hr />

Ehh, well I don't know. Gear level rewarded from quests increase with your level which actively affects your stats. And your stats do increase per level, which means you will do more damage in numbers, but as mob level / hp also increase that pretty much means that in terms of percentage you'll be about even. So gear is your main progression, gear which gets stronger as you level up (not the gear you got on you from before).<br />
<br />
Mainly this new system means you won't outlevel zones and run around oneshotting everything. You will however still see peaks and dips in terms of how many % of a mob's HP you'll be able to shave off in a single blow for each level you play through, so it's not as static as it may sound.</div></div><hr />

Okay, so while leveling you stay around the same %-damage done... you just see higher numbers. Okay, will be quite interessting to see in action.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No that's the opposite of what I'm saying. You will almost always for each level get an entire new set of gear through questing, which will increase your damage. So starting at level 105, let's say you deal 10% of a mob's HP in damage per blow. But as your gear gets replaced by better pieces while you play towards level 106, you will see your same skill deal maybe 12%, 15%, 20% and so on until you reach level 106. At this point mob HP goes up, and your % goes down as a consequence. This process repeats for each level.<br />
<br />
In terms of progression it will go like this:<br />
<br />
Reach level 105 - do 10% per hit<br />
20% into the level you have 3 new pieces of gear - do 15% per hit<br />
60% into the level you have all new gear compared to when you hit level 105 - do 25% per hit<br />
Reach level 106 - mob HP goes up, do around 10% per hit</div></div><hr />

How is that the opposite? You swing around the 12.5% mark the entire leveling process. So with the scaling it doesn't matter if you are 100 or 110 mobs will die in about 8 Hits. With a bit more gear it goes towards 6 hits, after a level up it may take 10 hits... so what? The entire leveling process is irrelevant. They could have just stayed at 100, give you iLevel X gear through quests, you don't notice your progression anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you don't always swing for the same % because your gear gets better every level. You will notice this for -every- level from 100 to 110, you are weaker at the start of every level, stronger towards the end of every level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, but every level feels the same. 100 to 101 feels the same as 109 to 110. So why not stay at 100 and make you feel stronger after completing a long questline?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's changed from today? You get stronger as you level up, you reach a new zone, you get weaker as mobs are higher level. Been that way since day 1. The only difference is that this progression is now continous throughout every single level in every zone, not only when you switch from say, Gorgrond to Talador.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah but changing the zone gave context to why you are weaker, if you get stronger and weaker all the time against the same mobs... how does that feel?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But why does it make sense for the wolf in Talador, to be stronger than the one in Gorgrond, which for some reason is stronger than the one in Shadowmoon? <br />
Here's the other side of that coin: The gear you get through the zones with the new system is an upgrade a lot more often and you can actually finish a zone and feel that everything you did was rewarding.<br />
<br />
Today I can go through Shadowmoon from 90 to 92 which is the natural point to switch to Gorgrond, and still only have 40% of the zone done since I do dungeons and whatnot in between. I can now swap to Gorgrond for natural progression or do the other 60% of Shadowmoon with reduced exp rewards and gear that gets vendored because it's of no use to me anymore. This repeats for every zone. Reaching 100 on my alt now I had half of every zone left unfinished.<br />
<br />
I -very- much prefer to be able to complete a zone with dungeons in between and still have a sense of going forward the entire time. The premature switching og zones in WoD and especially when leveling alts from level 1 is in no way any fun for me.</div></div><hr />

Okay, but that would still work if they scale up to you level - 3 so you feel a lot stronger than your enemys, but it's still rewarding enough to keep going. But if you switch to a zone that is made for your level, you get better rewards.<br />
I just cannot stand the idea of being able to level from 100 - 110 in one zone with no feeling of power progression what so ever.</div></div><hr />

Your take on progression is your own opinion, I get that. You will however see that you do go into levels feeling a bit stronger than you did going into the previous. Some gear found in treasures, on rare mobs, and quest rewards that roll upgrades will also quite often be stronger in terms of item level than the ones you get from your next level. Meaning you will see times when you go into level 105 dealing 15% per hit, the next level you might go in dealing 18% per hit. It's less than it used to be but it's still there. If you want to feel that much stronger than the mobs you go up against then yeah, this is probably a step back for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But why not just leave it at level 100 and give you small power increases with items while leveling, why this &quot;removal&quot; of progression while leveling?<br />
I get the point about being able to finish a zone... but leveling with next to now power increase againt mobs I killed for 4 levels, feels just odd... Maybe it won't bother me when legion is out, but the conecept doesn't give me a good feeling.</div></div><hr />

Can't say it's felt that much different so far. The increase and decrease in power is pretty small, I just never fully over-power mobs any more. The artifact goes a long way to ensure that you still feel powerful, I never use more than 5-10 seconds depending on CDs on regular mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the overpowering of mobs that makes you feel stronger... Being about the same power as the mobs makes you feel like you didn't progress at all.<br />
It's quite literally killing boars from level 1 to 100. always the same boars, always the same time needed to kill them. You don't feel different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do feel different through earning artifact power, relics and better gear. It adds up to more than enough power to feel the difference, just not on the same overpowered scale which I never really liked anyway. You'll still get to overpower pretty much anything at 110 anyway since mobs won't scale beyond that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but they could have done the same without increasing the level cap. Now it's just, there are no enemys between level 100 and 110... it's all the same and it feels like they wasted a lot of time on it.</div></div><hr />

Another case of a misinformed person. Plans are that order missions are only 3% of the content, if we believe blizzard. So there are 97% content left i you don't like it. And no they are not necessary like missions in WoD. to progress in your order you need order resources. you get those from treasures, outdoor quests and from beta i seen them drop from rare spawn, but NOT from missions. Additional to that they won't reward mythic loot or the amount of gold they rewarded in WoD.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't mean what you think it means. The mob has one common set of stats. Each player that encounters it applies their level as a modifier to the mobs health and damage. If it's attacks were supposed to do 4% base damage to the base HP of a player, it will do 4% regardless if you are 100 or 110. Gear modifiers are applied after that. The mobs health is also a set value that gets scaled up or down by the level of the player attacking it... But only as they see it on there own screen. A different level player attacking the same mob sees a different max health value.</div></div><hr />

I hope they change that. I am with you in this matter. Nothing in WoW was ever destroyed by the game (you can even repair totally damaged gear), but ships can and now followers, too? Why? Mobs and Bosses have access to a spirit healer to rez, but our followers are somehow pariahs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It makes it feel like you can select different zone progressions for each toon you play based on your personal preference. Quests rewards are a big chunk of leveling exp, but the order you do them in does not have to constrained any more by level. In theory you could stay in the same zone the entire way from 100-110... You would just run out of zone quests eventually and continue to progress (more slowly) on mob kill exp alone.<br />
<br />
I, for one, like this element of non-linear progression they are introducing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, removing the skull bag and sword would help. It was especially unsettling to see the sword both stationary and moving when the horse ran. I kept trying to see the second sword when it was standing still but no luck. LOL.</div></div><hr />

Quests rewards are a big chunk of leveling exp, but the order you do them in does not have to constrained any more by level. In theory you could stay in the same zone the entire way from 100-110... You would just run out of zone quests eventually and continue to progress (more slowly) on mob kill exp alone.<br />
<br />
I, for one, like this element of non-linear progression they are introducing.<br />
<br />
That would mean I want to level more then one character... which I generally don't. So for me it takes away more than it adds.<br />
And people who have alts, they know that they will repeat a lot of stuff... make it like the leveling in WotLK, 2 ways to get to 80. If you don't mind running around you could get 4 to 6 different paths of leveling out of that.</div></div><hr />

But for all those worried about it don't worry, Blizzard will have a copy paste for a Timeless Isle #3 so everyone on the server and from other servers will be on the island at the same exact time, getting everything done and complete at the same exact time as everyone else lol</div></div><hr />

Could you clarify what it takes away from the single toon approach? It sounded like vague griping in the OP and there's nothing to stop you from expriencing the zones and quests in a linear way that matches current leveling. Each zone will continue to have a set of content appropriate to your level and gear and by the end you are ready for L110 progression through whatever endgame content floats your boat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It takes away progression. If you do consistently about the same amout of damage to any mob, get get same gear everywhere. You don't progress, you just run on a treadmill until you hit the 6 miles and you can go do something else.<br />
Progression in WoW was always about gaining power, overcoming the enemys in your way. With scaling, you don't do that. Hit Level 107? Got, so did that fucking boar !</div></div><hr />

What would be really cool is , if this zone scaling works, Blizz applied it to the entire game. think about it even with heirlooms leveling from level 1 you wouldn't end up with the &quot;do 2 quests outlevel the zone&quot; problem you can have now. If it works as well as Blizz hopes it could open up some really nice possibilities.</div></div><hr />

This approach could save the game, and revive the bulk of unused, abandoned content that exists now. Would be very interesting if the Legion application is a test of the tech to apply it to the entire game down the road. It's a MASSIVE undertaking, though, so I have pretty solid doubts. Number one, the timeline of the expansions - starting a level one in Borean Tundra, and ending your leveling experience in TBC would be...interesting, disjointed, and bizarre. <br />
<br />
Still...plenty to ponder there. Or, just remove character levels, and make experience count for something else. <br />
<br />
I wonder if they have the balls to pull something like that off.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
So, here we are agin, with Ion &quot;Mistakes were made&quot; Hazzicostas admitting garrisons were a failure - so why not double down in Legion, and force them to work?<br />
<br />
Is this just plain old dev stubbornness to give up on an idea? Did garrison tech NEED to be carried forward? Or was it a convenient prop to paint a different color, and save dev time and effort? <br />
<br />
I think the disconnect between them and the players is more fundamental, though. The devs clearly see the game as one big experiment. They fail at something, like garrisons, or Ashran, and hey, no big deal, we'll try something different next time.<br />
<br />
But the players don't like that - and for good reason. They want a polished game, that works, not to be lab test rats. Players are far more emotionally invested in the game than the devs are. <br />
<br />
But I can't shake the feeling that what Ion is saying is &quot;Yeah, it's the same shit sandwich - but it has GARNISH this time!&quot; <br />
<br />
We agree that, especially in the long run, the balance of content and rewards between garrison missions and core world content was a big problem in Draenor. Players too often found themselves without much reason to bother with dungeons or outdoor content, possibly logging on to raid or PvP, and otherwise just checking in to collect mission rewards and send followers out on new ones. And after a little while of that, it's awfully easy for it to stop feeling like a proper MMO experience.<br />
<br />
It's good that you can see that, and admit it, Ion. But the proof is on you to prove that you've designed out of a bad design. Player's worries are not unjustified, you pulled the &quot;Just wait and see!&quot; with shipyards. The only justification you have for any of it is &quot;Wee! Log in and get free shit!&quot;. It's not content. You can tell a compelling story without it - you did just fine up until WOD. Garrisons and mission tables are not needed, but you talk like the only way to implement challenging, fun content is with them.<br />
<br />
Again, is this just plain old stubbornness on the dev's part to just let the flawed idea go? <br />
<br />
Because, honestly, you know what's more fun than mission tables? NEW ZONES AND 5 MAN DUNGEONS. <br />
<br />
I want to give you props, Ion, but I feel like we've heard all this before...</div></div><hr />

On one condition: That it be left up to player choice as to whether to use zone scaling or not. If there is no &quot;toggle&quot; as such, I don't want Blizzard applying this to the whole game.

<br />
Yeah you are right, if it is done right and works out well. Then doing it to the whole world, could make the game a lot better too. Cause then they can add quests or missions that send you out into the world, any part of the world and it will feel like an end game quest or mission, gets rather annoying when everyone is in Nagrand.. Then a couple patches later everyone is in Tanaan lol... Like oh cool I just this item and oh look so did everyone else on the server at the same exact time... How neat lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am the only one who is more irritated than anything about how this alpha has dragged on for 6 months? And then we can expect 2-3 months,at least, of &quot;beta&quot;? I get they they needed a big annoucement to generate hype early on but it makes you wonder what the hell they were doing during WoD. Typically they would have already started on the next x pac around the time HFC came out or even before that. Seems like they decided on a name back in Sept or Oct, whenever it was annouced and thats about it. All this teasing and hype generation is going to bite then in the ass because i for one am expecting quite a bit from Legion. They've had over half a year to fart around with just the alpha alone so this better be worth it or I feel like this will be my last x pac and I'm pretty sure I'm not alone on that.</div></div><hr />

1.) The horn goes through a hole that's too small. For the horn to go into the hole, the helm was either put on when the horn was much smaller and thus the &quot;horse&quot; has been wearing it for some time or the horn was cut off and regrown through the hole but still the &quot;horse&quot; has been wearing it for some time.<br />
2.) As a result of #1, the helm cannot be removed without removing the horn first. If you know anything of horns, once they're cut off (or fall off), they don't grow back the same way. Horns that are cut off often grow back in ways that can harm the animal.<br />
3.) Watch the non-mount version of the animal run. A saddle on its back would result in unnatural and potentially painful movement.<br />
<br />
Not really animal cruelty, but other nitpicks:<br />
4.) Blizzard's love affair with glowing bits got old in Firelands.<br />
5.) The tail is unnatural. It's another case of the WoD talbuk tail. For the tail to be positioned in the way that &quot;horse&quot; is, the tailbone has to be like a cat's. Horse tailbones aren't that long (maybe a foot or so depending on the horse's size). If the tail was meant to act like a cat, then it should have been designed like one, not like a horse. If they wanted a longish tail that wasn't cat-like or hose-like, then they should have looked at a cow.</div></div><hr />

Order Hall Followers and Missions<br />
<br />
I just cannot believe a word that comes out of Blizzard mouth anymore, they say one thing but a lot of missions on Alpha say something completely different. Unless Blizzard are going to change them since the feedback has spat it back at their face. They say it's only 3% of Legion content but i have a feeling that they are hiding something, i think Blizzard should just remove this crappy system as it doesn't have a place in WoW anymore, it never had a place in WoW to start with. If i do end up playing Legion and this follower system is the same as WoD, I'm going to have a field day on the WoW forums ripping Blizzard a new one. <br />
