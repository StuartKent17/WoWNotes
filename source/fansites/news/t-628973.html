<br />
They made the raid content relatively easy on purpose to allow people who never got to experience some of the harder Pre-LK content easier. However, unexperienced raiders are still gonna struggle on fights like Thaddius, Four Horsemen, and Grobbulus.<br />
<br />
Do I want 3.1? Yeah, I've only just started getting into LK content and I do find it easy. I also think Blizzard used the achievements to add some difficulty. &quot;The Safety Dance&quot; makes Heigan complicated (though not to me, that dance is cake--but to newbies, yeah). Also, tell me you did Sanctum with all three drakes up. I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's Par of the course with MMORPG's imagine a patch being released without seeing the sort of traffic it does when it goes live. That and at least it gives us something to do when the server's are down.<br />
<br />
And Blizzard said right from the very start Naxx was intended to be a STARTER raid. No designed for people that had been clearing higher tier content in WOTLK. I was surprised by the end of Wrath at the amount of people who hadn't even seen inside Kara. That being said they have said Uldar will be much more of a challenge, and it still is early days in Wrath so who knows what else is planned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There is always a way to make it more challenging. Besides going in greens (awfully foolish to spend hours and days getting gear and not use it), you can try for the achievements, raid on alts, gear up the slower people in the guild, etc.<br />
<br />
But at some point you want to take your main and your gear and take your guild's other good raiders and defeat some challenging boss. And besides Sarth with 3 Drakes there really isn't anything out there like that.</div></div><hr />

You have absolutely no idee what you're talking about.Testing ist about 1/2 to 3/4 of the work of software engineering.And you simply cant test a software that big with that much of people playing simultaneous without an PTR.<br />
Well you can, but it would cost tons of money an several MONTHS, or you just release it an fix the bugs later. In that case, WOW would be like Gothic 3 or any EA game. So be happy the way it is, it could be far worse.<br />

<br />
<br />
Because it devalues the gear. Epics become blues of the past so whats the point in being good when you can complete everything in a day with no challenge. <br />
<br />
However it is good to hear that blizzard wants to take the Sarth 3 drake design and move forward with it on more content so that will at least push more hardcore guilds to care.</div></div><hr />

No you're 100% correct. I am a programmer and I hate it when I hear threads like this about how theres bugs and how it takes so long etc. If you're not a programmer or if you don't work in software development then just keep your trap shut. <br />
<br />
Wow is by far one of the best pieces of software out there. For the size that it is they do an excellent job of keeping the bug count low and fixing things after patches. Also keep in mind, for those of you who were playing back pre-BC, everything was much worse. They have gotten better in the past few years now that they have more experience under their belts, and they keep surprising me with their products.<br />
<br />
What some people don't understand is that while changing something as &quot;simple&quot; as the way that warlock summons work could be much more complicated. Anytime a change has to be made or new content has to be added it could require a massive rework to the code that you never even see. In order to change a spell they might need to rework some of the existing code that handles spells. Now obviously this is just an example. The point i'm trying to make is that just because something seems like an &quot;easy fix&quot; doesn't mean its easy at all.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that changing one small spell could break 3 more. This is all highly possible and this is the reason patches take so long and the reason that they have a PTR for people to participate in. Theres no way they can re-test every spell and ability combination every time they change something. Thats not to mention once they throw in buffs and glyphs and such into the mix. Blizzard does much of the testing on their own development servers but they release it to the PTR to find a couple of those &quot;hard to find&quot; bugs and they test the stability of their code.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Newti</div><div class="date">2009-01-06, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent post monalin, says it all.<br />
<br />
On the topic of WoW 3.0 being too easy a lot has been said already and well, even though i consider myself a rather hardcore player (world 82. Sarth+3 10 man, glory of the raider achievement, etc...) I can understand why they made the content as easy as it is.<br />
I see it for example in my RL friends who didn't and still don't raid hardcore (never even seen sunwell, etc), and they do in fact enjoy the game a lot more now than they did in BC (especially at the end). And face it or not, there are a LOT more players like my friend than there are hardcore players who lets say did kill sarth+3 in 25 or 10man.<br />
So i really love the new approach blizzard is going to take at raiding with introducing a lot more &quot;hard modes&quot; with appropriate rewards.<br />
Chances are good my friend and I will both enjoy the game even more once Ulduar ships :).</div></div><hr />

From what i've read, before WotLK was even released they were working on content for patch 3.3. And saying that patch 3.1 (Ulduar) was nearly fully done already, and 3.2 was half done.</div></div><hr />

As far as 25 man raids on european servers go, it's so laggy most of the time that it's pretty much &quot;broken&quot; from a raiding point of view anyway. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's not only the EU servers that have this problem, I've heard some rumors that this kind of lagg only effects the older servers from 2005-2007(in EU and US) and that it's taking so long for blizzard to fix it is cause they have to order new hardware (a.k.a new servers). BUT this is just a rumor I've seen going around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That wouldn't surprise me. My guild's server is part of the &quot;Cyclone&quot; battlegroup, one of the oldest in Europe, and to be honest most of the time Naxxramas is practically unplayable for a 25 man raid group, especially at peak times.<br />
<br />
It's not very enjoyable when you feel like you're fighting the lag far more more than the bosses, and could do with being fixed asap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is my English so bad? (sorry about that)<br />
<br />
I play on European Server. When I log into the game there is on the left side a window, where news are posted e.g. Servermigration or maintenance announcements. And the upcomng maintenance this week is from 5am to 11 am, wich means no extended mainteance (wich would be 3am to 11am).<br />
<br />
So the patch is not going to come to live servers this week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you have a better method of testing something with millions of variables (a.k.a. players) apart from just letting them loose in a smaller and more flexible environment, then I suggest you write to blizzard and wait for your medal :)</div></div><hr />

Speaking for the US servers we had a memo last night that our maintenance would start at 3am PST, and finish app. 11am PST. Does this mean we are getting it today?..Who knows. When I saw it state that it would start at 3am instead of 5am I got my hopes up, but as we all know what they post and what happens is not always the same.</div></div><hr />

true that... could they not just what do you call it? quick patch it in? Is it really that hard for them to do that? I will be exalted by the time this patch comes out. :-\</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 months now, the elemental shaman has been struggling to not be at the bottom of a damage meter during a boss fight.<br />
2 months now, Hunters have been ridiculously overpowered in pve.<br />
Still no patch.<br />
<br />
Last week, someone discovers that using a pair of vendor sold axes with FB/FT combo does really high damage because of a programming error, and within 48 hours it's hotfixed.<br />
<br />
Last week a video comes out of a mage soloing the Military Quarter of Naxx, using spellsteal on their bone shield to absorb, then deal out insanely high damage, and within 48 hours it's hotfixed.<br />
<br />
I wish Blizzard would get off their asses as fast to fix things that they've known about for months.</div></div><hr />

Patching and hot fixing something on their side is IMMENSELY DIFFERENT. They can't just release patches like that. <br />
<br />
<br />
Man someone pissed in your cornflakes this morning. He has a legitimate reason for being angry. We all do.<br />
<br />
This patch is taking far too long because they keep tagging extra crap onto it. Release the stuff that is already tested, IE stuff that was on the PTR in the very beginning and put this other stuff with the next patch. Sheesh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I generally don't complain or get upset but I have to agree...I have been looking forward to this patch for so long ...they really need to release the stuff that has been on the ptr for a while...such as the shammy changes..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-01-13, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, pretty sucky Blizzard actually has to PTR test their own product instead of relying on unpaid players...<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe the PTR is empty because players are sick of having to test Blizzard's content on the PTR then again on the actual game. They are always changing things, fixing bugs, and &quot;improving&quot; the game the next patch, so basically we test the changes when they go live anyways.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the WoW world is starting to dwindle. It doesn't seem like WotLK was as successful as classic and TBC. Sure they have 11,000,000 players now but that has more to do with marketing than anything else. The just expanded into Latin America and the already market almost exclusively to China. If you look at the actual percentage of population that Blizzard markets to now they are hitting less than 1% of the population of the area they actually market to, and that has dropped from when they first came out.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-01-13, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, tell me you did Sanctum with all three drakes up. I doubt it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;reward&quot; for doing it with 3 drakes up is a joke. You get a chance at a novelty mount and a &quot;spiffy&quot; title. That is great for people that actually give a damn about those things, but for anyone that really doesn't give a damn about novelty crap, there is no real incentive to doing OS with 3 drakes up that don't come from having 2 drakes up except maybe bragging rights, and I think the majority of people agree that if the only thing in life you have to brag about is your achievements in WoW then your life must truly suck.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-01-13, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because it devalues the gear. Epics become blues of the past so whats the point in being good when you can complete everything in a day with no challenge. <br />
<br />
However it is good to hear that blizzard wants to take the Sarth 3 drake design and move forward with it on more content so that will at least push more hardcore guilds to care.<br />
<br />
<br />
It doesn't devalue the gear. Lets be honest, this game has never been that difficult. Raiding in WoW comes down to how long you can put up with 24 asshats before wanting to cancel your subscription. TBC (even pre-nerf) had VERY few difficult fights. The gear is about the amount of effort you put into it. It is not about the amount of skill you put into it. Raiding Naxx for 10 weeks to get the item you want makes it pretty damn valuable to you rather you clear Naxx in 10 minutes or 10 days.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-01-13, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What some people don't understand is that while changing something as &quot;simple&quot; as the way that warlock summons work could be much more complicated. Anytime a change has to be made or new content has to be added it could require a massive rework to the code that you never even see. In order to change a spell they might need to rework some of the existing code that handles spells. Now obviously this is just an example. The point i'm trying to make is that just because something seems like an &quot;easy fix&quot; doesn't mean its easy at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
I never claimed that it was simple. I simply believe we should GET WHAT WE PAY FOR. If your excuse is we don't because its hard then I have to wonder where my money goes. Other people have hard jobs. Cops have hard jobs, should we suddenly hold them to no standards at all because their jobs are to hard? Doctors have hard jobs, should we suddenly let them kill their patients because the job is so hard? I don't think so. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that changing one small spell could break 3 more. This is all highly possible and this is the reason patches take so long and the reason that they have a PTR for people to participate in. Theres no way they can re-test every spell and ability combination every time they change something. Thats not to mention once they throw in buffs and glyphs and such into the mix. Blizzard does much of the testing on their own development servers but they release it to the PTR to find a couple of those &quot;hard to find&quot; bugs and they test the stability of their code.<br />
<br />
<br />
In a very real sense they are relying on volunteer testers and making money from it. It would be interesting if someone brought a suit against a MMO for that practice yet again. There is no incentive give what-so-ever to actually play on the test realm, so if they plan on having a successful test realm in the future they better start rewarding those testers because the days are coming to an end when any company or even any person could get something for absolutely nothing. If they are counting on love for the game to carry it through then they are sadly counting on the wrong thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This game is about GEAR. You want to make me want to actually bother doing it with 3 drakes up then make some legendary items that come specifically from that encounter. Till then, I'm not going to bother doing it for a stupid title or stupid special mount. I care much more about use value than looks value. As far as doing it for progression, I could give a crap less about progression. If some guild wants to brag about being top on the server then good for them.</div></div><hr />
