Join The Great Collegiate Dungeon Race 2017!<br />
Tespa is excited to announce The Great Collegiate Dungeon Race! On September 22, we’ll start a 7 week series of World of Warcraft ® Mythic Keystone dungeon races between teams competing for a share of $20,000 in scholarship prizing. Will your collegiate team on your campus have what it takes to take home the prize? Sign up now and start assembling your party!<br />
<br />
Register Now (https://compete.tespa.org/tournament/87)<br />
<br />
More Information<br />
Group dungeons and the teamwork they involve are centerpieces of World of Warcraft. And with the Mythic Keystone system introduced in Legion™, players are encouraged to gather up four of their friends and take on even greater challenges! With each increasing level of Mythic difficulty, the health and damage of enemies increases, and at certain levels new modifiers are introduced that will require players to adapt, evolve, and work together to succeed.<br />
<br />
The Great Collegiate Dungeon Race begins on September 22 and will conclude on November 12. All races will take place on the World of Warcraft event realms—players will choose their preferred classes from premade character templates with fixed item sets and Artifact levels. The tournament will play out across three separate phases at increasingly challenging Mythic levels in order to find the best adventurers Azeroth has to offer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Preliminary Rounds: We’ll be running 3 preliminary rounds over 3 weeks in which teams will run a single Mythic Level dungeon for placement on a leaderboard.<br />
Playoffs: The top 16 teams from the preliminaries will then be seeded into a double elimination, best-of-three bracket which will run until only four semifinalists remain.<br />
Semifinals &amp; Grand Finals: The four semifinalist teams will compete in a single-elimination semifinals and finals to see who takes home the top spot.<br />
<br />
<br />

Flying in Argus<br />
The zone is so drab and really feels like nothing more than broken shore 2.0...same atmosphere/scenery just with too much mob density.<br />
<br />
We spent months earning pathfinder just to have flying removed yet again. This is going way too far blizzard, especially with the terrible terrain design on Argus. I hope blizzard will rethink their once again &quot;no flying&quot; debacle before they lose another drove of subscriptions in order to get their attention.<br />
I think plenty of folks disagree with you on the first point, and Argus has been one of the best parts of Legion to me personally, but just to clarify on the second:<br />
<br />
This is nothing new, and we don't have any plans to change this going forward. New zones added in patch content have never to my knowledge had flying allowed. Even when flying was introduced in 2.0, flying was not available on the Isle of Quel'danas when it released in 2.4. The same is true of Isle of Thunder and Timeless Isle from 5.2 and 5.4. These zones have always been about exploration, with a bit of danger, and Argus fits quite nicely into that theme.<br />
<br />
I can understand that you may have recently earned Pathfinder and want to fly, but no one is stopping you from flying anywhere you want over the Broken Isles - but this is Argus.<br />
<br />
If you're having trouble getting around Argus, you're probably not paying attention to the landscape. If you're dying in Fel flows, you're probably charging head first into them instead of leaping across the rocks floating about. If you're constantly being tagged by mobs, you're probably missing an easier way around the groups.<br />
<br />
Argus isn't supposed to be a friendly and hospitable place, and I wouldn't bet my gold on a demon sitting down for tea with me any time soon. If you're having trouble and finding it difficult to get around and avoid pitfalls, then Argus is working as intended.<br />
<br />
With all due respect you guys aren't understanding the issue. Before when new patch content was released without flying.... We had had flying since the moment we hit max level. so we actually got to enjoy is for quite awhile before ti was taken away.<br />
<br />
Now, it's taken away very shortly after most people have earned it.... DOESN'T FEEL NEARLY AS GOOD'<br />
I do understand the &quot;issue&quot; but we don't see it as an &quot;issue&quot;. You're not on the Broken Isles anymore. <br />
<br />
I think we'd probably try to avoid things like this being so close together in the future, but its just a symptom of timing as far as I'm aware.<br />
<br />
Well, perhaps it's time for the development team to acknowledge that flight is actually part of the game and develop content with the idea that we can fly rather than take the mindset of &quot;we don't like flight, so we're going to restrict it--even after making people jump through hoops and holding them back for nearly a year without it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The genie is out of the bottle. The development team needs to open their minds to that idea rather than constantly look for ways to pull back from it. <br />
<br />
I remember Lich King and the idea that we could fly early. And we flew. And we had fun. It was OK, really. <br />
<br />
Why exactly do the developers feel that only by restricting flight can they give us new things?<br />
We can say buzz phrases like &quot;the genie is out of the bottle&quot; all day, but it doesn't get us anywhere. I think it's been well acknowledged that we are still open to the idea of flight or we wouldn't have flight in any content at all, no? We've moved to meet the community in the middle - that's what Pathfinder has been about. Earn your wings: show you've achieved completion of the content overall and you can fly.<br />
<br />
There's not really an attitude of 'close mindedness' on the topic from the development team, we've had plenty of positive discussions on the direction of flying overall. I do think, however, that there are folks in the community who are 'close minded' to entertaining an idea of &quot;maybe you shouldn't be able to fly around and skip all the content when new areas are released&quot;. <br />
<br />
I think these conversations need to be a two-way street, and the more we have everyone in the community calling the development team closed minded or pointing fingers, the further we get away from amicable understanding within the community. Of course I've always been happy to have those conversations, but whenever they start they very quickly dive into arguing instead of a discussion on the merits of each approach and that's really not something I want to be apart of.<br />
<br />
I also don't think asking pointed, rhetorical questions is going to get us anywhere.<br />
<br />
Tanaan. Wonder why you forgot about Tanaan. <br />
<br />
Tanaan. The patch zone that allowed flying. <br />
Tanaan, the MOST RECENT patch zone before Legion. <br />
Tanaan, the patch zone from the only other expansion that made you earn Pathfinder to fly before this one. <br />
Tanaan allowed flying because after you've waited over half a year to earn something, what you want is for it to be useful going forwards.<br />
Tanaan was technically a part of the original overworld of Draenor. It wasn't added in a patch - a door was just opened via your shipyard in patch. <br />
<br />
I don't think they're quite equitable for a number of reasons from how they are accessed, the number of zones, how invasions and world quests function, etc.<br />
<br />
Uh, I hope you're saying with timing and not rolling back on content releasing faster.<br />
Yeah, timing wise. I don't have answers in front of me, and it's just my personal opinion, but I think in terms of spacing the fact that flight landed really close to the launch of 7.3 was unfortunate timing. <br />
<br />
I get why people are upset to have &quot;just earned flying&quot; and now its &quot;taken away&quot;.<br />
<br />
And how much of the terrain in Isle of Quel Denas was made to intentionally impede you? in Timeless Isle?<br />
Well, Quel'Danas was pretty much an experiment of its time, but it did have a good bit of terrain to get around, especially for the dailies on the east side of the islands with the naga and such. Argus is massive compared to Quel'Danas, so most points comparing them are pretty moot.<br />
<br />
I don't think the terrain was made to intentionally impede you by way of making you frustrated, as you can easily teleport to any subzone of all three zones, but rather it wants you to not charge head first into everything and actually explore. If that's how we wanted the game to be played, we'd probably just have a flat plane with a couple of trees here and there. <br />
<br />
The most frustrating part of Argus for me has been the area between The Spirit Crucible and the entrance to Antorus in the Antoran Wastes with the demon camps, bridges, and Fel flows, but I found that I was always looking for a shortcut and jumping off ledges instead of taking the route that was laid in front of me. Once I stopped doing that and learned other paths to the areas, I was having a much better time.<br />
<br />
Establishing a history of bad decisions doesn't make it right.<br />
Your one-liner is nice and all, but I'd appreciate it if you could explain to me why those were &quot;bad decisions&quot; retrospectively.<br />
<br />
Yet its not a core game feature, its a convenient feature that saves time daily on an MMO. I never thought of it as a core feature, as the game doesnt REQUIRE us to have flying to progress anywhere. You can easily play the full game without flying, and you can play it with flying, that does not make it a core feature if you don't require it to finish the game.<br />
This is semantics really but I'd agree that flying is not a core game feature. The community sees it as one for convenience, but in terms of design the game plays the same with and without, so it's pretty far from what I'd consider core.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; If that's how we wanted the game to be played, we'd probably just have a flat plane with a couple of trees here and there.<br />
<br />
So Valley of the Four Winds/Tanaris/The Barrens/Desolace/Jade Forest? Can we have those back? Please? I'll trade a raid tier for well-designed zones again.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; but I'd appreciate it if you could explain to me why those were &quot;bad decisions&quot; retrospectively.<br />
Can you adequately explain why pruning game features, making players earn them back, and then pruning them again before the expansion is over is considered a good decision?<br />
<br />
In fact, should we start calling expansions contractions if they continually remove content?<br />
I think I remember classic Desolace and Jade Forest very different from you.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to acknowledge your second points, as I warned earlier in the thread: I also don't think asking pointed, rhetorical questions is going to get us anywhere.<br />
<br />
Let's refrain from this if you want to have an engaging conversation.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; TBH if blizz made the whistle usable on argus to take you to the nearest port that'd be cool.<br />
<br />
They did, but gated it behind a reputation.<br />
I think that's a point of discussion that's of some worth here.<br />
<br />
IMO anyone who quits because of no flying on Argus(and I doubt there will be many) was on their way out the door anyway. If you can't stand having to interact with the world, I don't see why play the game at all.<br />
<br />
I'm very glad we're grounded on Argus because all flying really does is make the game feel small.<br />
<br />
Some of us respect you Ornyx. Just because this isn't even worth your time with how 'stupid' some of these people are. I could've used a meaner word but its not worth it. I dont even understand how people seem to think flying is so important. Someone even said its a core feature, when 0% of the game require us to fly to complete it.<br />
I don't think I'd go quite that far. There is a point to be made for flying, and I think it's become a huge part of the game for the community, so it is an important conversation for me. For example, I do think the timing here is what has made this stick out even more, with a lot of folks earning flying just a few weeks before heading to Argus. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I just think we need to meet in the middle and be civil and not throw threats around and we can have good conversations to take to the development team. <br />
<br />
You're a blizzard employee. You have to agree with everything they do, at least publicly here on the forums. <br />
I don't have to agree with everything we do. I have a personal opinion that I've expressed many times about content throughout Legion and beyond.<br />
<br />

And I mean come on, its not that hard of an area, sure you die if you run in and don't think first, but isn't that what makes the game fun, having a challenge. Also there are some great advancements here, you can portal places instantly and can even get special powers to help you run from your mistakes. You all may not agree, but my vote is to keep flying out of Argus.<br />
<br />
Flying takes you out of the world and makes everything easier, and I don't mind that for content I have already done many times, but in new content it shouldn't exist for a while...</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;If you're having trouble getting around Argus, you're probably not paying attention to the landscape. If you're dying in Fel flows, you're probably charging head first into them instead of leaping across the rocks floating about. If you're constantly being tagged by mobs, you're probably missing an easier way around the groups.&quot;<br />
<br />
I almost spit my drink when I read it I laughed so hard. All the roads have mobs either on them or close enough to where they aggro you. Sure, you can &quot;avoid&quot; them, but they still aggro. I think I found maybe 4-5 roads where it wasn't really patrolled by mobs? <br />
<br />
Some of the terrain is really annoying, but I easily get down from 1 level to another thanks to being a DH. And is it me.. or are there not enough portals?</div></div><hr />

Mobs on the road hardly make a difference to be fair, you can simply ignore them. If you aren't one to 180-and-back to avoid Daze there's always the crafted items that make you immune (though I've actually not been dazed on Argus yet whilst running). <br />
<br />
As for portals, yeah, there's ones that seem close to each other, none further away. I'm guessing/hoping they will add more as we &quot;push&quot; further into the zones. Not sure though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How does the ability to fly suddenly stop you from interacting with other players? You can &quot;pretend&quot; it's not an online game just as easily on the ground, especially on dead servers. In fact, I myself do that for most everything, including Argus, aside from Rares and Invasion Points which obviously need groups of people. Not having flight doesn't change that.</div></div><hr />

I mean I'm not too fussed. If it happens then it happens and of course I'll unlock but if it doesn't then meh not hard at all to get around Argus on the ground.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you believe you're quitting the game simply because there is no flying on Argus, you're kidding yourself. You obviously don't like the game from any aspect, something so small and petty as not flying in a zone would not make you quit.<br />
<br />
And as the blue post said, these types of areas have NEVER HAD FLYING. Why would they make this any different???</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aernath</div><div class="date">2017-09-06, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, perhaps it's time for the development team to acknowledge that flight is actually part of the game and develop content with the idea that we can fly rather than take the mindset of &quot;we don't like flight, so we're going to restrict it--even after making people jump through hoops and holding them back for nearly a year without it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem is skipping all this and getting hang on &quot;We can say buzz phrases like &quot;the genie is out of the bottle&quot; all day, but it doesn't get us anywhere.&quot; Also blaming it as a &quot;rhetorical question&quot;, well your answer is also rhetorical too, dear dev? This is what politicans do. It's not sincere, it's just avoiding the real problem.<br />
<br />
Let's name it: &quot;Restricting players&quot; is the real problem, timing is not the problem but ordering of things is, keep players grounded at low levels, by all means, but not in end content, we did our walking, slow running and slow mounts already, we don't get flying from the get go anyways, we already &quot;earned&quot; it, just having to earn it over and over again with every expansion is ridiculous and illogical.<br />
<br />
The method to earn it every expansion differs, because the zones and their climate etc were different? Well, it could be done, in Cataclysm we could fly-quest from the start and there were no problems. But now devs can say &quot;But Cata zones were part of Azeroth&quot;, alright, then aren't these are also part of Azeroth? Isle of Quel'danas, Isle of Thunder, Timeless Isle, Tol Barad (which was the worst part of Cata, because we were grounded) and alike...<br />
<br />
See? These are all bad excuses, insincere lies to avoid real problem, yes they don't want to give flight since the start of Warlords, they were adamant about taking it away completely but the backlash was so strong they had to find a middle ground but still made it too hard, almost undesirable, a big percentage of players didn't bother, many casuals even don't know how to get it still.<br />
<br />
Is this the right approach? Clearly not, it's a big problem constantly being avoided and in the end looks dumb in the game:<br />
Here I have a big shiny drake, that I earned with hard work in this game, I can summon it in this new place to carry me on to my new adventures, but hey? Its great wings can't lift it off. So the solution of this mindset would be either not allowing flying mounts on these new places too, or allow it even if it looks dumb, but at the cost of restricting players from flying it's a &quot;bargain&quot;?<br />
<br />
No, it's just wrong, order the progression of player power, it's logical that players can and will be able to fly, after certain power level: Everywhere. They should ride drakes, magical creatures above these new lands and go down and deal with problems and get into new adventures when they want, it's quite dumb to defend a paved way and being grounded instead of free flight. It's just bad design and ruins the logic and fantasy of the game with every move in this restricting direction.<br />
<br />
I hope Blizzard comes to their senses at the end and even add content to Silvermoon and other old, currently non-flight zones to make it flight viable one day. I know it's a far fetched dream now, but, once we were talking like this, after we got our wings at TBC, we were dreaming about all Azeroth and being able to see Hyjal and Uldum, it eventually happened, it was awesome and with the real meaning of the word &quot;fantastic&quot;. I also believe this dream of free flight and content according to it can also happen. It would just be appropriate and surely more fun than what we have now.</div></div><hr />

WoW no longer an &quot;MMO with communitys of players running around&quot; since introduction of phasing technology.

Well, I keep running into the mobs, but I just recently figured out why. Apparently there is a mouse sensitivity issue since patch. <br />

<br />
Shit is driving me nuts. I look around and immediately turn to the mobs and run straight through them. I've tried the cheap fixes, but nothing is working. Hopefully they will fix this soon so myself and lots others can enjoy the patch more.<br />
<br />
As far as the portals go... ugh. Placements are horrible right now imo.</div></div><hr />

That said there are a lot of things that frustrate the hell out of me on Argus. First and foremost is Blizzard's insistence on making it a pain in the ass to get somewhere and the seemingly random way elevation and climbing works. There are far too many &quot;you can't get there from here&quot; spots where you have to nearly backtrack and go a different way to get places. The high edges near the fel waters come to mind. Bridges are nowhere you'd expect them to be and you end up having to jump from cliff edge to cliff edge. Trying to remember the annoyingly non-obvious or remotely straight route to a quest objective isn't fun for me. I don't think it is fun exploring, I don't find it exciting or dangerous to do. I find it tedious. Just let me get to my quest objectives so I can get my &quot;chores&quot; done for the day so that I can go do the parts of the game I enjoy. I get that other people may have another interpretation of fun than I do, but I don't see how anyone enjoys navigating Argus or even several older zones in the Broken Isles.<br />
<br />
A second issue is mob density, and I don't see how the Blue doesn't see it as a problem. I find the zones difficult on my 915ish mage. Normally I'd use my slows and run in circles until the mobs I have to fight are dead. That doesn't work well as you can't run in circles when you're pulling an additional dozen mobs while you do so. And that's assuming the slow even works at all as most mobs seem immune to CC, which is especially annoying with a warlock when I can neither enslave nor banish anything on a planet full of demons.<br />
<br />
Finally there is one mob I find overtuned. I can't think of the name, but it is a caster mob near the &quot;space dock&quot; area. They're usually in pairs and cannot be CC'd. They have a pretty powerful cast which can be interrupted if you happen to have an interrupt, but it casts faster than most ranged interrupts's CD's. After 3 tries with the 915 frost mage with 4pc, and concordance, I was kill one mob. 915 isn't exactly high, but I shouldn't have that much difficulty with just one mob, especially one that frequently travels in pairs. With my 930 warlock I can reliably kill one of these mobs thanks to pet tanking, but I cannot take 2 on at once. There are a lot of tough mobs out there, but I don't have consistent difficulties as I do with this one type.</div></div><hr />

Babe Anarchy Online had flying before World of Warcraft and it doesn't turn it into a single player experience, you're just talking out your ass to justify a reductive design decision because Blizzard can do no wrong in your eyes. Whether you're 5 people mounted on the floor or 5 people flying around it's the same experience in WoW as you just go from World Quest to World Quest ignoring everything else but the flying makes you progress quicker.</div></div><hr />

Cmon guys get real, in WoW we have close to 0 stuff built for flying.</div></div><hr />

I get that we don't get flying right away, but now we had Argus for a lockout and i've seen the lava, mountains/ridges and demons and it feels i've seen it all. Also doubt the last zone will be much different. <br />
Blizzard has a 3 week plan for the opening of Argus, so wait those 3 weeks + one lockout then just give flying back. By then we've seen it all plenty of times while running around on the ground doing the dailies, again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.<br />
<br />
No flying at max level in wow is just blizz making sure to hinder you though travel. It's one of the lowest forms of design and development one can do to hinder a gamer.<br />
<br />
Even after you have seen the largest majority of the zone, lets make sure to hinder the gamers in getting to the action. The part of the game that is most enjoyable or exciting and fun, lets design it so gamers have a hinderance in getting to that part of the game. Slow them down with some of the worse world design we can make.<br />
<br />
I also love how blizz hides behind the &quot;don't ask rhetorical question&quot; BS answer. Makes them not have to answer the more direct questions thats for sure.<br />
<br />
No flying the way blizz keeps doing it is one of the top 5 things that stops me from playing wow. Their constant selling of flying mounts, using them as rewards to then only deny you using their ability to fly in content you might actually want to play and lets be honest. Trash mobs is content barely worth mingling with once much less 30 times as blizz hopes you will. As if that was ever fun or enjoyable.<br />
<br />
blizz has developed a pretty &quot;F&quot;ing warped sense of how to keep things enjoyable because their current design with end game flying isn't it.<br />
<br />
I get the feeling they look at argus and think, hey dumbass! Run around that path one more time because that death by a 100 cuts is working out great in our design. It's not fun but that grind is just around the corner.</div></div><hr />

I do think flying needs to be introduced in Argus, but I don't think it should be right now. Either time gate it say behind the first heroic Argus kill or make a pathfinder part 3, both factions to revered, each new place explored and x amount of unique world quests completed. Let us see the content and appreciate it, but then let us have a easier time on alts. <br />
<br />
And in fairness (I could be wrong...) Argus I'm sure is the biggest 'addtional' patch content we've had in terms of land mass. It's defo bigger than Quel'dunas or Tanann.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WHAT content? The content of getting dazed?<br />
<br />
The actual content on Argus, as in the questlines and world quests, would not get &quot;skipped&quot; if people could fly. It would just take slightly less time to do them. Just like people still do world quests in the older Legion zones now that we have flying there.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of the content in game, such as raid, dungeons, arenas, battlegrounds, pet battles etc etc, those are not affected by flying and would therefor not get skipped either if we could fly on Argus.<br />
<br />
I would not have nearly as much of an issue with no flying on Argus if we were daze immune again like in WoD.<br />

Also I would most certainly prefer larger more open zones with less terrain, with or without flying.</div></div><hr />

Vanilla and Flying go well together. I would like to play Vanilla over Legion every day and I'd be totally ok without flying. Vanilla had much better map design and you don't miss flying because you absolutely don't need it.<br />
Legions map design is absolutely terrible for ground mounts. Stormheim, High Mountain, Suramar, Broken Shore and Argus are designed so terrible that navigating without a mount is time-consuming and not fun at all.</div></div><hr />

You can die all the way possible on argus, falling off cliff, mob aggro from point A to B, fel lava and etc. and the amount of player changing spec to tank on argus<br />

Why people would not want a feature presented by blizzard themselves? I know blizz is famous for doing some shit and then just trowing it into garbage but holy hells, this is some new level of blaming.<br />

<br />
Both happened. To paraphrase : Blizzard in it's infinite wisdom did an interview that coincidentally went live on the Friday of a three day weekend that stated &quot;We aren't adding flying in&quot;. Then the backlash hit and people did unsub in droves.<br />
<br />
Was it the only reason for the mass unsub? Probably not, but it was a factor of it. Otherwise they wouldn't have backpeddled and added in pathfinder for Draenor roughly 2 weeks (iirc) after the fiasco started.</div></div><hr />

It's possible. I only noticed the change after he armory bashed someone and even then he was wrong about what the player had experienced since all he looked at was the raid bars on the front page of the characters armory.

<br />
Wrath zones also allowed and encouraged exploration - if you were bored questing and wanted to go run around on the edges of the next zone, you could. Now, everything is on rails and you physically can't get to certain areas until the quests allow you to. I've always hated that kind of design, and it's a foundation of WoW design now. It's just more gating, to prolong the content. I get that there's always going to be a certain amount of it, but they tripled down on it. The last time I played WoW was the shipyard beta on the test server, for WoD, and I tested it, for sure - I swam to Tanaan, and it completely broke the zone for that character, because I didn't follow the quest rail. That's when I knew I was done with WoW, for good. If there was one feature I loved about WoW, from the first week of retail, all the way to the dumpster fire that was WoD, was exploration. It never broke the game, until then. Hell, running from Teldrassil through the Wetlands was one of the most fun accomplishments as a low level elf in vanilla. Or swimming my rogue around both continents, at level 10. I tried that in WOD, and they're purposely making shorelines inaccessible now - or like with Tanaan, it breaks the game. The old game design had occasional places to get back on shore. They're trying to keep players in dev designed boxes, and that killed the game for me, among many other things.<br />

See my long-winded post above. They can't change how they design the zone, to include flying, because they'd have to change their questing-on-rails design they're committed to. Flying breaks that. You can't see stuff until Ion thinks it's okay for you to see it - never forget that.</div></div><hr />

Astonished why they didn't take that route again in Argus as you would have to work hard as an ace pilot and likely not get to your destination quicker than riding on the ground would in the end. Made for more interesting gameplay leaving players with options instead of leaving them with the sense of prolonging content right after unlocking flying in the rest of the expansion. <br />
&quot;Expansion -&gt; contraction.&quot; LoL, Blizz giveth and taketh by cutting as many corners as possible. Difficult to see the labor of love these days for all the bs-design decisions, what a blizz-snob of a dev earning his keep by peddling word-salad that hardly makes sense.</div></div><hr />

There's a lot of that on both sides honestly. And a ton of it on display here. &quot;Oh, he disagreed openly with people. He's about to explode.&quot;<br />
<br />
His job is to say what Blizzard wants him to say and give his own opinion within limits. He's doing what's intended. It's all pretty mild compared to the stuff that's directed at him both here and there. There's a whole litany of catch phrases associated with the flying debate. Knocking them down and calling them out as such when they've been repeated ad nauseum is fair game. Repeating catch phrases isn't anything like discussion.<br />
<br />
Yawn.</div></div><hr />

Whether you're 5 people mounted on the floor or 5 people flying around it's the same experience in WoW as you just go from World Quest to World Quest ignoring everything else but the flying makes you progress quicker.<br />
<br />
Ha Blizzard has done all the wrong in my eyes since patch 4.3 so no thats not true but its probably for things you wouldnt agree with. players like you cry for stupid shit like flying mounts and whistle convinience items that helped contribute to ruining the MMO part of the game<br />

<br />
You sure about that? Because I've definitely seen the Vindicar getting attacked. It was from the ground, but that same thing could happen. Like flying around those elite demon areas in Ogri'la back in BC. It has shields that are blocking the blasts.</div></div><hr />

You can't not admit that one of the most common dreams people have is flying. Flying by yourself, not on a plane. So any game that enables that dream is... a dream come true. Flying is FUN. Yes, yes it is! It's not about skipping, about convenience, about not being available for PvP (I play on a PvE realm btw). It's about getting on a dragon up in the air.<br />
<br />
Now...this is a game. So the point is to HAVE FUN. The point is not to 'explore', to 'take your time', to interact with other people etc - these are all means to an end; if they bring fun, cool, if not, then they should be modified. If people want to make a point about flying / not flying, they should say what makes it fun and the opposite unfun. As subjective as that is. Anything else is kinda pointless.</div></div><hr />

its obviously not done if you want to fly over it, if it were then you wouldnt have any purpose there. :cool::rolleyes:<br />

Apparently you don't know what playing MMO's involves so I'll fill you in. Once you do the content at least once and it starts the repetitive grind you can clearly says, I've have seen the content or the majority of it. It's time to start flying and getting over the things you don't need so you can get to the things you do. No one needs to run that rat maze 10 times or fight the same worthless mob again and again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I take it you will continue to ask the same question? :rolleyes:<br />
Until you answer I might as well continue to ask.<br />
<br />
Are you one of those it the journey and not the destination type of people?</div></div><hr />

I do since I've been playing them for a long time and they must not be so worthless if you need to get to something that they are blocking...<br />

<br />
Then feel free to fight every mob on the way. Not every gamer believes they need to be killed eac and every time you step out the door or take to the road.<br />
<br />
After a few trips, there are important mobs and then they is worthless trash. No one needs to kill that trash over and over just to get to the place they actually need to be. At that point, flying is needed and is warranted. You've seen the content. Best the now worthless trash and want to get to the mobs and area that actually got you out into the world. That road and useless trash surely isn't what moved you to get out.<br />
<br />
If you want to waste your time killing that garbage over and over, feel free. Not everyone needs to or wants to waste time on that once it's been done a few times. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I take it you will continue to ask the same question? lolololol :rolleyes:;)<br />

I will till I get a direct answer because that way when I reply there will be no gray area in the response. Are you one of those it the journey and not the destination type of people? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
