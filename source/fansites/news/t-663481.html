Dunno how hard the heroic mode will be but if u can clear everything, its 15 emblem *4 per week w/o dailys:&gt; <br />
HM might even drop more than 3 emblems</div></div><hr />

Ya but that's still only one piece of the mid level t9 per week if you did both hardmode full clears, both normal full clears AND all the heroic dailies lol.<br />
Then there's the nice offset badge items..<br />
<br />
It will be weeks/months before many people have badges to spare - right now they're priceless.</div></div><hr />

It depends. If you are in a guild that can clear Heroic 25-man CC pretty easily or with some effort then you'll be getting tokens to use for tier. I'll probaly use badges for runed orbs if we get some of the patterns soon because the crafted gear is bis where as the tier gear i'll be replacing once I can start getting tokens from 25-man heroic.<br />
<br />
Of course our guild rarely drops priest/warlock/pally tokens. At least they aren't restricted by gear slot anymore so I can get the ones I need from any boss rather then waiting from one boss for the rng.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very true , but with T9 heroic costing around i &quot;think&quot; 30~70 Emblems it will take , if you are just clearing 25+10, <br />
<br />
15 for 10 man<br />
15 for 25 man<br />
14 for dailies <br />
---<br />
44 Per week , and it will take you around 6 weeks to get enough just for the Tier , <br />
<br />
But then again the Hardmodes just drop the Trophy and no need for emblems , but for most guilds it will be a while, and for the pro's more money in the bank, Not complaining , just saying its gonna be useless for a while<br />

I don't know man, I'm planning to craft the plate dps bracers and chest piece ASAP on my DK. They're almost BiS quality, if not actually BiS. Hell, I'd say the plate chest is even better than the ilvl258 tier chest. And the bracers are pretty much equivalent of the ToC10man hardmode bracers from Jaraxxus. I can definately spare badges for crusader orbs.</div></div><hr />

Well this is true but it's not really a good thing for your raid's point of view if everyone takes the view that they're just going to wait for the 258 tier; 245 is still a massive upgrade. My guild always supplied runed orbs/sunmotes for crafted gear free of charge anyway..</div></div><hr />

I'm dissapointed with 3.2, I hate 5 mans with a burning passion and I can't do 10 mans so i only have 20 emblems, the accessibility of T9 tokens is outrageous to people who PuG heroics, in comparison to actually raiding T9.</div></div><hr />
