<br />
Druid Artifact Transmog in Battle for Azeroth<br />
The latest beta build added the Artifact transmog system:<br />
<br />
<br />
When transmogging your weapon, there is an option under the weapon type drop down menu called &quot;Artifact Pair.&quot; <br />
When you select this, you see your basic artifact weapon and the different versions of each weapon.<br />
When you right click the version, a list of the different forms and color options is able to be selected to apply to your character.<br />
The form is still linked to your artifact weapon and so your weapon will appear as the claws or daggers (based on spec) regardless of what weapon you have equipped. (ex - your equipped polearm would still turn into the dual daggers).<br />
A similar system is in place for other classes.<br />
<br />

Uther's Tomb Updates<br />
Uther's Tomb received some more updates in Battle for Azeroth. His statue has been upgraded and two locked doors have appeared on either side of the stained glass window. If you look through the bars, you can see stairs leading down into an unknown location.<br />

<br />
What happens if they want to add different forms now not connected to artifacts? Are they done with making new druid forms now?<br />
<br />
They should have just made a tab for each form, similar to each weapon tab in the transmog menu, then you unlock a form when you collect the weapon.<br />
<br />
Then they could make it backwards compatable with the fire kitty and compatable with any future forms they want to add. <br />

(I don't see why they can't add at least one new form per expansion)</div></div><hr />

Why can't they just let people transmog to whichever weapons they can use regardless of their actual weapon? They already have the technology, come on!

<br />
If you notice there is a glitch in Werebear form that makes it unable to keep the hands open if you are using the Artifact appearance. That's because you can't sheath/Unsheath it, they never fixed it for the entirety of Legion expansion. Btw, I really wanted to be able to use staff again as Druid, it fits the class fantasy, seems that all the effort I made to get those appearances will be in vain... Cuz I rather to use a cool weapon than fugly claws...<br />
<br />
Which leads to the problem N2: <br />
<br />
Lack of refreshing new features to OLD/Classic Races... Come on, Not everyone want to play an allied race as main. Most will probably stick with their old mains. <br />
<br />
I'll probably stick to pixelated Night Elf bear, because of this Glitch, Poor decision of Blizzard to attach forms to claws and because of cool staves as transmogrify. And because I won't pay for race change only to get new forms... which sounds absurd to me, paying to get new content on a expansion that I already paid for...<br />
<br />
A new expansion should be REFRESHING for everyone, I believe they are neglecting a huge group of players... <br />
<br />
HUMMMM, worgens and goblins... yep, I have no hope with Blizzard. They keep wasting money on new MOB models for content that only going to be explored for a few months before new content is released, But they can't work on keep Playable toons models updated...<br />
<br />
I can't remember how many times RIOT GAMES updated League of Legends Playable and NPC models... They update even their LEGACY skins models, which blows my mind. They don't have to touch their unobtainable legacy skins, but they do.<br />
<br />
Blizzard can do it as well, but they won't because of rea$on$. All they do seems like lazy job TBH.</div></div><hr />

It's not just you. The artifact pair system isn't working properly on the beta for me, either.<br />
<br />
It's also a half measure from Blizzard, as expected. In yet another &quot;BfA will be like Legion, only worse!&quot; moment, we're stuck deciding between ugly weapons and old druid forms. I didn't grind out the mage tower challenges to wear comically oversized claws and PINK daggers forever.<br />
<br />
[Edit] I found the problem. It seems that, for some reason or another, the same artifact appearance can be listed under each artifact weapon category multiple times. If the game won't let you apply a particular appearance, check the list for another entry and try that one instead. Not sure what's going on behind the scenes to bug out the artifact transmog lists, but every appearance I have available on my beta druid has one bugged option and one working one.</div></div><hr />

Iam on the beta and i can tell you yes you can so if you have another druid you can tmog that druid to use the new skins though iam not sure but i do believe its still level locked so toons under 110 wont be able to tmog it so if you have a lowbie druid you wont be able to do it afaik.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, whenever they do make any updates to old stuff you get rivers of tears from players who don't like change. There were so many people crying about how they were forced to play the updated Blood Elf model because it wasn't an option anymore to go back to the angular low res version. The absolute horror! And there's already hunters starting to cry now because Blizzard has updated a good majority of beasts from classic on the beta. &quot;The colors are not a perfect match, the posture is different, the face doesn't look the same&quot;, etc. <br />
<br />
They're kind of stuck between hopeless nostalgic that will raise up a storm whenever a mere pixel is added to their beloved character, and people who would really like for the game to get freshened up. And for some reason they refuse to just rip the band-aid and make the nostalgic folks adapt.</div></div><hr />

Well guess who was right?<br />
<br />
What would be really funny is if Blizzard would create a &quot;Redeemed Undead&quot; allied race. Still ghastly in appearance, but not rotten (showing no bones and such), with paladin as one of their available classes.<br />
<br />
And in the Alliance :P</div></div><hr />

Could be Alliance, Horde still need another Paladin, though I am almost positive we are getting Zandalari Paladin since they went back on no DI Shaman and I am pretty sure their introduction quest-line will be us helping get Rezan back for their priests and prelate.</div></div><hr />

I guess Seal of WTF is a catchy name tbh.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, Zandadins are a must. It would be a terribly wasted opportunity if they weren't available. Golden warriors for the trolls who live in a city of gold!<br />
<br />
Maybe the recruitment scenario for the Zandalari trolls IS the story where they get them back. Zandalari and Kul Tiran scenarios aren't yet in the beta, are they? When did they say those races would be available? Depending on the moment, there could be enough story room for that to happen.</div></div><hr />

Well obviously it's a compound word made of war and torn and therefore qualifies for this kind of fun in my eyes, but I'm not a native speaker so I might be wrong...</div></div><hr />

The first major content patch, also Kul' Trian I have a feeling their story is connected to their druids.</div></div><hr />

The shorthand name of an item used by the playerbase doesn't have to be a true acronym. The poster you quoted also didn't specify it would be the acronym.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
A good number of the professions (JC, BS, LW, etc.).<br />
BIO technically being short for biology and meaning to need a bathroom break.<br />
RP for roleplaying.<br />
CD for cooldown.<br />
Many dungeons (SFK is Shadowfang Keep, BFD is Blackfathom depths, RFD is Razorfen Downs, BRD is Blackrock Depths, etc.).<br />
<br />
Seal of WTF will almost certainly be the player chosen name.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't have seen that coming, that's for sure.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard likes to play these word games. I think this name was intentional.</div></div><hr />

Just like Blackrock was one word and people still called the raid BRF.<br />
Sometimes people just skip that rule</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. Artifact appearance skins are still spec specific.</div></div><hr />
