[item=30063] now reduces the mana cost of Holy Light by 34. (Was 84 before the nerf) - Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/libramabsolutetruthv2.jpg)<br />

Essence of Immortals quest removed - Sunwell Plateau unlocks over time<br />
That's it, the Essence of Immortals quest chain has been removed to make the competition even between servers, gates in Sunwell Plateau will just unlock over time. <br />
Apologies that this update is coming so late but we pulled the Essence of Immortal quest chain about 2 weeks ago. That's why you haven't seen it on the Public Test Realm. The 3 gates will open automatically over time at equal intervals on all servers.<br />
<br />
Regarding the taking back of the town on the Isle, however, that will still be dependent on completion of daily quests. Servers can race to see who can open their quest hub the fastest. But access to raid bosses has been made equal.<br />
<br />
We really like the concept of cross-server competition. But the concept of the gates being tied to specific boss kills was not playing out as we had hoped. We plan to do future things that involve servers competing with one another through major events.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character creation changes on TTR<br />
Devs made a few changes to the TTR and added random spawn locations upon character creation.<br />
[blizzquote author=Eyonix source=http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5103816008&amp;postId=51031892399&amp;sid=1#0]Sometime today we'll be pushing new data to the PTR Tournament realm and once the update is made, players will now randomly spawn into one of the following locations upon character creation:<br />
Northshire<br />
Stormwind<br />
Coldridge Valley<br />
Ironforge<br />
Shadowglen<br />
Crash Site<br />
Valley of Trials<br />
Razor Hill<br />
Sen'jin Village<br />
Orgrimmar<br />
Camp Narache<br />
Deathknell<br />
Sunstrider Isle<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Eventually, we plan to have many more spawn locations than what's listed above but we also intend to remove capitol cities from the list of spawn points. Additionally, we plan for all vendor locations to have three of every vendor available with the exception of the armor vendor, in which case there will remain one. For today's push this will only be true for the racial starting zones and the vendors outside of capital cities.<br />
<br />
Please also note, that capital cities will only have vendors outside the city limits, and only have battlemasters within the city. This is done for all capital cities for today's push except for Exodar. There will be a fight promoter at every spawn location where players can:<br />
Bind to the location.<br />
Teleport to a capital city (teleport to Exodar temporarily disabled since it's unavailable)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our ultimate goal is going to be having vendors in every immediate town surrounding a capital city. Using Stormwind as an example, Northshire, Goldshire, and Sentinel Hill in Westfall will eventually all be filled with vendors.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the next build will involve the wiping of all existing characters. The purpose behind the character wipe is as follows:<br />
There is a new character template and it needs testing.<br />
We want to continue to test random spawning.<br />
We want to test the spawn locations.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With that being said, upon character creation a basic set of items equipped, and from there you will be able to further customize your character via the vendors.<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone who have both tested and provided feedback, as it's been invaluable!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This Druid stuff makes me laugh, it's like they don't even recognise any other healer than them. 20% off Regrowth cost, what the hell Blizzard? Mana isn't even an issue for Resto druids. It's like they are too scared to nerf them, even though they are incredibly over represented and extremely powerful healers</div></div><hr />

<br />
@ Post:Overall I was pissed about the LB nerf myself. The bloom effect (not the HoT) is the only thing that keeps me alive move of the time in pvp. (being balance and all) Whether or not nerfing the bloom will do any good for resto spec'd druids, hard to say. I don't think it will personally. <br />
<br />
I say nerf the HoT effect off of the actual healing talents. Isolate the lifebloom with a 10% healing increase instead of the overall 25% (I think that's it) like they nerfed bear dps back in the day. I dont think the rest of the class needs to be hit when it's one spec that uses it to an insane advantage. To my original point, they are not really hurting resto druids that much with this, just balance and feral.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're not hurting resto druids at all:<br />
-Empowered Rejuvenation: This talent now properly affects the final heal from Lifebloom. (5/5 is a 20% increase)<br />
Lifebloom: The bonus coefficient on the final bloom effect has been reduced by 20%. This spell will no longer cause error messages when interacting with Spellsteal or while the Druid is under the effects of Mind Control.<br />
<br />
In short, after this, resto will be exactly where it is right now... well, except that it has cheaper regrowths and no more PVP set speed. (EDIT: Actually, the math comes out to be about a 4% nerf for resto, so about 100 healing. LOL)</div></div><hr />

<br />
how often do druids use regrowth in arenas? are castable heals their strength or their hots and survivability? lifebloom is getting nerfed (sligthly); their talent 'natural perfection' is getting nerfed (less survivability); their 4 piece arena bonus is getting nerfed (less survivability).<br />
<br />
as a consequence, they will be a bit less overpowered in the small brackets and they will be even worse in the only bracket that matters.</div></div><hr />

But the rest is just &quot;meh&quot;, Holydins really need some love soon. With theKarazhan Libram nerfed as well, we will be healing worse than 2.3 - a complete joke.<br />

I have a resto shaman and today in 3v3 I faced a druid with inferior gear and he had more healing, more mana, and more cc than me. It sucks :( Another nice little tidbit about cyclone too. I saw the druid casting cyclone so i earth shocked. The ES hit him but yet i was still in a cyclone. Then again I saw him casting it so this time i dropped a grounding. The grounding totem was on the floor... and i was still in a cyclone. I just dont know what else to do really. fuck druids.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qsad</div><div class="date">2008-03-08, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Octopus, mana isn't an issue for resto druid, yes, but it is for moonkins in PvP. I take balance druids as an example cos' a play one but i guess it's quite a problem for a feral too in a long fight.<br />
I think they changed it to balance a little bit the lifebloom nerf (1000+ spell damage gives me something like 120/bloom on tic, it was pretty insane).<br />
Now, Balbaroy, the main strength of the shaman, in 3v3, is his shield which makes him a lot harder to take down for a rogue or a warrior. Shamans, paladins and priests are tanking healers. Druids are &quot;fleeing healers&quot; if you like (faster than others, cannot be slowed down/immobilized...), this is why a druid will always be a better healer in PvP compared to a shaman or a paladin in 2vs2 or 3vs3.<br />
By the way, grounding totem makes you immune to cyclone and earthshock stops its casting. You probably were out of range from the totem and missed your earthshock (resist? too late?).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Psykhe</div><div class="date">2008-03-08, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is really that grounding has a 15 sec cooldown, ES a 6 sec cooldown..and cyclone a 1.5 sec casting time. YOu can dealy it a bit, but you cannot prevent it.<br />
<br />
Another problem with the shaman concept of &quot;tanking healer&quot; is that their &quot;tank&quot;, aka earth shield, can be removed without too much of a problem, even with the new 30% resistance. It would be compareable if travel form of the druid could be dispelled.</div></div><hr />

Paladins aren't broken in PvE but they are and always were the most boring healing class to play. I can't speak for everyone but in my guild 3/4 healadins including me ( been paladin since wow release ) are gonna roll another class for Wotlk.<br />

You do realise tho that all the downranking part has been rewerted by BLizzard now ? That was just a temporary fix so that all Holy palas didn't quit when Illumination was taken down to 60%.<br />
<br />
Flash of light is back beeing the only viable fast heals from paladins. And yes - its getting boring. I've played holy paladin for the past 3 years and Im not even gonna give BLizzard the pleasure of rerolling. My reroll will be in WAR or AOC.</div></div><hr />

Resto druids are low tier healers btw in PvE, so please get your facts straight. 2v2 arenas are not the only thing in this game, I wish you QQers would recognize this.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's only nautral to defend Resto Druids, they are amazing healers. :) All I want is for Holy Paladins to be up to where Resto Druids are in terms of overall PvP. I don't like to raid because raiding guilds are mostly fueled by greed and an unhealthy obsession, but I'd like to see Holy Paladins have a more interesting time healing there also.</div></div><hr />

Downranking is pretty much useless now except rank 7 greater ( or 8 don't remenber ) <br />
I'm not talking about raid trashs or heroweaks here but 25 mans raid bosses where we are the best at healing the tanks, especially the MT, and in this case you don't downrank because you have to start casting before he takes dommage ( and interrupt before the end if he doesn't take any ) so you really can't know exactly how much he is gonna take and as we frenchies say it is better to have too much than not enough. And before you talk about mana, I'm farming Illidan and never had a problem with it.</div></div><hr />

Rank 9 spam if you want to see your Tank alive. Nothing less will do. But then. Pile up hots that do 1.2k per tick and u kinda figure out how pointless flash is. Not to talk about rank 4 holy light. Thats also 1.2 heal with 2 sec cast. Kinda says it all doesn't it ?</div></div><hr />

Now about lifebloom. In 1st PTR build emproved rejuvenation (tier8 talent in resto tree) now will works with final lifebloom tick. It's +20% from bonus healing.<br />
In this PTR build we have -20% from bonus healing to lifebloom overall. Resto druids now have same lifebloom what they have on live, but feral and moonkins got nerf. Yes, nerf moonkin and feral more =) Thats what we need.</div></div><hr />

In other words. Blizzard doesn't know jack shit what they are doing. Kalgan lost to a Holy paladin in 2v2 last night with his Warrior - druid setup so its time to &quot;fix&quot; things.<br />
<br />
Isn't it becoming very obvious this isn't about balancing ? Or did no1 see the 247% number from druids in 2v2 compared to paladins 19% ? And woopsy ... Kalgan is loosing now so lets change back !!<br />
<br />
&quot;Paladins are good for farming&quot; - Hmm - wonder who said that ?</div></div><hr />

so i took all my gear off and i got ...<br />

3728 Base Mana so calculation ...<br />
<br />
3728 : 100 = 37,28 x 21 = 782,88<br />

I can't remember what my mage is right now, about 3500X0.21=735mana. This is a change from the current blink cost of 28% BASE mana 3500X.28=980mana. The changed to spellsteal, blink and invisibility are nice for PvE but in PvP like when I am trying to use Spellsteal as a Dispel on a sheeped priest, I can blow through half my mana before I break the sheep. Looking at the results of what Blizzard thinks classes should show in the arena teams and how they are right now, I think they are trying their hardest to break the little buffs that look so innocent like +15% travel form. All I know is, with the new Imp blink talent, cost decrease and getting my 4th piece of glad set this week, i'm going to be spamming it with a smile. Now if they just make it banish a nearby demon so those stupid felhunters will stop bending me over...</div></div><hr />

Read the PVP class balancing part. 247% versus 19% ? <br />
<br />
Nah - not so special. Considering that holy paladins will no longer be viable in 2.4 raiding content Id think you should not talk about classes beeing good in one field and bad in another. The name buffadins is starting to sound familiar again. But now its 30 mins buff so you can just leave them outside instances instead of bringing them with you inside.<br />
<br />
Paladins are the new &quot;Elixirs&quot; of WoW.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lebeau</div><div class="date">2008-03-08, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My issue personally, is that the role of a Healadin is rapidly depreciating.<br />
<br />
Druids had their HoTs, Shaman had their AoE heals, Paladins were the best at single target healing while Priests could handle all three facets decently. At this point although Shaman and Priests heal for more with their 1.5 second cast heals than Paladins, Paladins downranking HL with proper talents/gear/buffs could still pull out ahead in the single target department in both HPS and HPM.<br />
<br />
Then gradually patch after patch we see the constant whittling down of our healing potency, efficiency, and mana regen.<br />
<br />
-Blessing Of Light nerf with downranked HLights.<br />
-4 Piece T5 nerf<br />
<br />
<br />
At this point the HLight build suffered tremendously and all but died out. But we still maintained a decent lead over the other classes in mana efficiency to secure our own place in the healing lineup. At least until the next few patches heavily boosted the mana efficiency of the other healing classes.<br />
<br />
-Meditation and Intensity had their effectiveness doubled.<br />
-Watershield turned into a free perma 50/mp5.<br />
-Spirit Healers getting a massive regen buff in 2.4 with regards to spr based regen.<br />
<br />
While paladins get:<br />
<br />
-Libram of Souls Redeemed/Absolute Truth nerfed to idiot proportions<br />
-Insightful Earthstorm Diamond nerfed<br />
<br />
So patch by patch our healing output and mana efficiency is lessened while other classes who already have A) far more healing options than us B) actual mana restorative abilities and C) higher HPS output with their 1.5 and 2.5 sec heals maintain their superior Healing output and receive further boosts to their mana efficiency!?<br />
<br />
Currently in an endgame raiding environment, you bring your paladins for the blessings and then you stick them on healing the MT not because they're the best at it, but because that's all they can effectively do.<br />

You are mistaken, lesser buffs can be cast on anyone and last the 10 minutes, the greater buffs however can only be cast on people in your group or raid and will be removed the moment the casting paladin leaves the group or raid.</div></div><hr />

8 mana. yea its a buff by definition. *insert wanking sign here*<br />
<br />
FoL spamming paladin? how many of those do you know? if you FoL spam in a fight where you're MT healing, you lose. The fact that you even bring this up indicates you really dont play or know anything about holy paladins. Let me break it down. I'll use the priest example but I can do it for any other healing class. Hell shaman can single target heal just as well as us and no one brings them to raids for that. They have the OP chain heal...<br />
<br />
But I digress...<br />
<br />
Our max rank HL is 840 (with all talents) mana and heals like 3-4k (without +healing). <br />
Max rank Greater heal from a priest is 720 mana (with talents) and heals 5.5-6.5k (without +healing) <br />
<br />
Sure we have illumination (our only *nerfed* talent regen that our whole tree is built around), but they have clearcasting, and meditation, and that one spell that makes a spell cost no mana. Priests are able to stack much higher +healing as their gear is properly itemized for regen. It either comes with spirit or Mp5 which allows more stats to be put in healing. Ours has to come with crit AND mp5 which forces the amount of healing on our pieces to be lower. To sum it all up, priests casts bigger heals for less mana while regenerating mana at a faster rate than paladins. They can also HoT, Aoe heal, flash heal, insta cast heal, prayer of mending, and shield targets. We get BoP on a (properly talented) 3 min c/d. Did i mention that when specced disc, they survive longer than plate wearing paladins in any form of pvp. <br />
<br />
yea... Have you looked at the Holy paladin tree? Seen anyone spec into it? there are some useless talents in there. Sure there are things that people pick up to be a bit more viable like Imp LoH and Aura mastery. I even know people who have purifying power, but thats useless. WTF is blessed life. Gimme a break. Our tree sucks and BC did nothing but make it even more dull and more UP.<br />
<br />
In other news, greater buffs definitely disappear when you leave a group in which a paladin gave you the greater buff. 10 min buffs do not. We could 10 min buff everyone for boss fights then leave though :/</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bittersweet</div><div class="date">2008-03-09, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually FoL spamming on a MT is viable once you have the gear, BoL is on the tank, and there are other healers on the MT. You just have to gear yourself more like a shaman instead of the typical paladin. To successfully heal with FoL spam you need to stack pure +healing gems and have the 4 piece T6 bonus. <br />
<br />
Take http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Illidan&amp;n=Thannis for example. His FoL heals for 2.2kish non crit. However FoL spamming is quite boring, so having a decent HL and FoL rotation while healing is essential for the &quot;oh crap&quot; moments to top your assigned healing target off.</div></div><hr />

And maybe the whole picure of 80% in 5v5 has somehing to do with 247% in 2v2? And 80% makes druids crap in PVP? Wait till you go down to 20% in any bracket and you might have a point. But you know s well as me ur talking bull here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LoSR is not the mana redux Libram Skulver. It's the one that increases the benefit from Flash of Light. On live it's barely better than the Blessed Book of Nagrand in that it grants only 26 more unmodified +healing IF the target is under the effect of Blessing of Light (which in a raiding environment won't happen to anyone but the MT/OT unless you have 3+ paladins). <br />
<br />
With 2.4 the LoSR is getting nerfed by about 45 points. It will currently increase FoL's healing effect for 19 less than the BBoN. Great. Nice to know that a level 64 quest blue is now better than a level 70 epic that drops randomly from a raid boss in the middle of a 10-man, attunement requirement dungeon. /sarcasm<br />
<br />
<br />
IED was hugely buffed in the last patch, they increased the proc chance from 2% to 5%.<br />
<br />
Can you cite your reference on this one? The proc chance has not been increased at all to my knowledge and has not been documented in the Official Patch Notes nor in the Undocumented Changes on either MMO-Champion, WorldofRaids, WoWhead, or WowDB.</div></div><hr />

That is one (probably the best) way - since retri palas, unlike their holy counterparts - are wanted only in very limited amounts. Not to say there is no place for one in a raid, but there is no lack of DPS classes that usually do a better job (fittingly so).<br />
<br />
Ofc you can also get it by being the sole retri pala in the raid (although retri is the poor spec of an otherwise lovely class).<br />
<br />
Unfair? No, if anything there are already too many palas in end game raiding (last time I checked they were the class with highest representation). There are many specs that are not much wanted in raids/have one spot at most (and that is being nice). But the same is true (or even more true) to other aspects of the game (e.g. Arenas).</div></div><hr />

ERm - you do realise that retri pala T6 has diffrent items than Holy paladin set ? So you think any guild would allow a holy paladin to be holy and then take Retri set instead of making him more viable in raid has healing class. <br />
<br />
Are the 3 diffrent specs of warlocks faced with this problem ? No - so the point about 2 warlock specs beeing as bad as paladin specs is just false. Utter crapp. Since that warlock can still change his spec and use same T6 item to benefit the &quot;broken&quot; specs. <br />
<br />
Last time you checked is always nice argument instead of bringing out the facts. Show us the statistics and you might have a point. Or at least show us the &quot;last time u checked&quot; stats - just so we know where you get your information from.<br />
<br />
There are many specs not wanted in raids? - oh name me one plz... We are kiling illidan and we even have a OOmkin - but no way we use Retribution paladin. And we now run it with 4 holy priests since they are have alot more healing power in a shaman/shadow priest group than any other healing class. Oh and... that takes our priests in raid up to 6. Wonder if they are not represnted enough in PVE - or if they are suffering badly in PVP. Last time I checked they were not http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=4957.0.<br />
<br />
And warlocks ... Ive yet to go into a raid where I see less than 3 warlocks in it. But I've been in plenty of raids with just two paladins. <br />
<br />
And yes - we have killied Illidan - I know what IM talking about. And all these facts are pre 2.4. Things will get alot worse for paladins come that patch with the changes to spirit/intellect. Then you will see the true meaning of beeing a buffadin. But now its 30 min buff so an alt can provide that standing outside instance. <br />
<br />
Some of us actually see where this is heading. Others - like yourself have no clue.</div></div><hr />

Dunno what ur on about m8 - Wisdom is not needed for trash clearing - And it can be buffed before bossfight outside instance - leaving it on for 30 mins. THat paladin doesn't have to be inside the instance. <br />
<br />
We run with 4 holy priests in raids atm and 1 holy paladin. 2 paladins in raids - up to 6 priests - killing illidan. And we need to lower the numbers of paladins in 25 man raiding content? Or maybe its time to change the buffs? <br />
<br />
You do realise that 16 of my talent points go into having 5 diffrent buffs when all maxed out ? I personally use 1 of those buff. And I dont even need the improved 5 mp5 - 2 talent point cost for that. <br />
<br />
Maybe we should put that into perspective. Healing druids and Priest are getting over 150 EXTRA mp5 for free come 2.4 while casting. 40 mp5 wisdom ? Nah - maybe worth buffing before some bosses from outsite but defently not worth putting a gimped class into an instance.<br />
<br />
You are another of those players that have no understanding of other classes -all you are happy about that others have to suffer cause u will benefit from it. <br />
<br />
Well - good luck to you. You must have alot of good paladin friends.</div></div><hr />

Actually, the lock itemization is different according to spec. If you are affliction you will stack SP damage. Destro (most likely spec on end game raiding) will also take hit, haste and crit. So get better informed please. <br />

Last time you checked is always nice argument instead of bringing out the facts. Show us the statistics and you might have a point. Or at least show us the &quot;last time u checked&quot; stats - just so we know where you get your information from.<br />
<br />
Wow Web Stats - usually 1st page of a few bosses. Last time I checked was quite a while ago, so I just did a review (1st page of Illidan kills). copy and C&amp;P into a spreadsheet, removed parses that were not aligned due to C&amp;P issues. Results of 42 WWS submissions (1 was clearly invalid, 5 were out due to the alignment issue - from the resulting 44, 2 were removed for having 26 players):<br />

It seems that palas lost their spot for shammies. A sign of things to come?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are many specs not wanted in raids? - oh name me one plz... We are kiling illidan and we even have a OOmkin - but no way we use Retribution paladin. And we now run it with 4 holy priests since they are have alot more healing power in a shaman/shadow priest group than any other healing class. Oh and... that takes our priests in raid up to 6. Wonder if they are not represnted enough in PVE - or if they are suffering badly in PVP. Last time I checked they were not http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=4957.0.<br />
<br />
And warlocks ... Ive yet to go into a raid where I see less than 3 warlocks in it. But I've been in plenty of raids with just two paladins. <br />
<br />
And yes - we have killied Illidan - I know what IM talking about. And all these facts are pre 2.4. Things will get alot worse for paladins come that patch with the changes to spirit/intellect. Then you will see the true meaning of beeing a buffadin. But now its 30 min buff so an alt can provide that standing outside instance. <br />
<br />
Some of us actually see where this is heading. Others - like yourself have no clue.<br />
<br />
<br />
For starters, there are specs that are not wanted in raids at all (e.g. disc priest,...) and specs that are not stacked (off specs where there is only room for one). If your guild does not want a retri pala over a Boomkin (personally I would rather have the first than the second - abstractly speaking), it is your choice really - many setups work. It may mean that they need the palas they have for healing, or that their Boomkin is better performing than the candidate retri pala... you certainly should know better the reasons than myself (and I don't care about them tbqh).<br />
<br />
But what is your point? Whining about retri palas not being stacked in raids (which is quite sensible - &quot;there is spot for one at most&quot; seems to be the common opinion and palas have a more important and viable raid role), whining about other healing classes being better or whining over other classes being more represented in raids (something that you really shouldn't complain about ^^)?<br />

The tooltip still says 2%, the effect however now procs 5% and testing seems to bear this out which appears to have been a stealth buff in 2.3. The comment there and several on the IED page itself discuss it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
8 mana. yea its a buff by definition. *insert wanking sign here*<br />
<br />
<br />
A buff is a buff. I was just pointing out your mistake (remember, the imaginary nerf you were all upset about ...)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
FoL spamming paladin? how many of those do you know? if you FoL spam in a fight where you're MT healing, you lose. The fact that you even bring this up indicates you really dont play or know anything about holy paladins. Let me break it down. I'll use the priest example but I can do it for any other healing class. Hell shaman can single target heal just as well as us and no one brings them to raids for that. They have the OP chain heal...<br />
<br />
<br />
Ignoring your ranting if you only use holy light then Libram of Souls Redeemed is getting buffed for you, since they are increasing the benefit to Holy Light from 105 to 120 increase, it gets nerfed for FoL spam. So it seems that as far as you are concerned both librams you claimed were getting nerfed are in fact getting buffed which kind of takes some of the wind out of your Blizz want to kill paladins conspiracy.<br />
<br />
It is interesting that all I did was point out that the items you claim were being nerfed have in fact been buffed. I have to ask why you cared if you then turn around and claim no paladin in their right mind would have used those items anyway. If as you claim you believe Holy Light spam is the only way to go, then in fact both librams and the IED have been buffed.<br />
<br />
But that won't matter to you. You have adopted the &quot;Oh no the sky is falling, blizz hate paladins&quot; attitude and it will take far more than mere evidence to sway you from that.</div></div><hr />

THat paladin doesn't have to be inside the instance. <br />
<br />
Clearly I was talking about Judgment of Wisdom, my bad. (IE a plus for ret pallies.) <br />
<br />
<br />
We run with 4 holy priests in raids atm and 1 holy paladin. 2 paladins in raids - up to 6 priests - killing illidan. And we need to lower the numbers of paladins in 25 man raiding content? Or maybe its time to change the buffs? <br />
<br />
Cool, well obviously your priests are better at healing then your pallies. I know I wouldn't trust anyone else with MT healing than our leading holy pally :)<br />
<br />
<br />
You do realise that 16 of my talent points go into having 5 diffrent buffs when all maxed out ? I personally use 1 of those buff. And I dont even need the improved 5 mp5 - 2 talent point cost for that.<br />
<br />
You do realise that I have to choose my talents that will entail using two completely different styles of healing (CoH and Imp spirit)??<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe we should put that into perspective. Healing druids and Priest are getting over 150 EXTRA mp5 for free come 2.4 while casting. 40 mp5 wisdom ? Nah - maybe worth buffing before some bosses from outsite but defently not worth putting a gimped class into an instance.<br />
<br />
Hhahahaha, you're joking right? Paladins have by FAR the most mana out of all the healing classes (in terms of +int on their gear). If anything this is a massive buff for paladins.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are another of those players that have no understanding of other classes -all you are happy about that others have to suffer cause u will benefit from it. <br />
<br />
Well - good luck to you. You must have alot of good paladin friends.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems I do. Also seems your raid thinks you're a lot worse then their priests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A buff is not JUST a buff. There are varying degrees of such things and coming to us and saying LoAT is getting an 8 mana buff is like saying you get an extra 5 marshmallows in your lucky charms. It doesn't matter, cause you're going to eat them all before the milk anyway.<br />

<br />
<br />
If we want to do patch compilation, then that 15 heals (wewt) increase doesn't compensate for the down-ranking penalty received previously. Sure its a buff for this patch, but claiming paladins are getting &quot;buffs&quot; in this patch is like saying a .01$ donation to charity does something worth a damn. [Holy shock aside which I have yet to see viability for in PVE other than trash clearing.]<br />
<br />
As for your last statement. I never said they were getting nerfed. I never said Blizz wanted to kill paladins. All I said was what was in my post and that was solely that playing Paladins sucks now cause the only place we have in raids is buffing. Every other healer is more viable. I mean, you can't look at our 41 pt talent and say its good. Its laughable. Compare it to: Tree form, Earth shield, CoH. Those are interesting talents worth their weight in 1 point. Ours is just crap. Yay half mana cost for 15 whopping seconds. Get a couple crits yay mana back...awww DI is gone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Wtf are you talking about? I (again) never said they were being nerfed, just that the &quot;buff&quot; was insufficient. The &quot;problem&quot; with the class isn't librams anyway. There are fundamental issues that need to be reworked. I also never said that &quot;no paladin in their right mind would use those items anyway.&quot; Where do you get this stuff? They are good items. When you hear that they are receiving a buff and then it gets (all but) retracted, its a little disheartening especially when the amount downgraded was as much as it was.<br />
<br />
To finish with this quote, how has the IED been buffed? There is absolutely no way that the IED has been buffed for a HL paladin. With HL being our highest critting heal, the chance proc from illumination is now gone. So what made it buffed? Dont bring up 5% proc rate, because until it is in patch notes or live, I'm not going to believe comments on a webpage. This doesnt change the fact that it was nerfed for holy paladins either. If they keep this 5% proc rate and the illumination trigger, then we're a bit better off. Now we've just had a class advantage taken away from us. Hence, nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But that won't matter to you. You have adopted the &quot;Oh no the sky is falling, blizz hate paladins&quot; attitude and it will take far more than mere evidence to sway you from that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now you're just being a prat. I'm pointing out the state of a specific class. I in no way think blizz *hates* paladins, yet you take every point I made that had legitimacy and ignore it. I think you confused my post with someone elses. Either that or you're 14. It's hard to tell. Don't mean to insult either, but you really dont know how to formulate, much less express, any kind of argument. <br />

<br />
I never thought I'd see the day... The above poster was right. You really do know nothing about other classes.<br />
<br />
Insidelane, paladins have mana regen based on casting. Spirit in no way is useful while casting. Paladins have NO spirit (I think mine is sitting with 120 or something). Thats why good holy priests play the 5 second rule with casting because they get to keep like 800mp5 between casts. Just because paladins have a ton of int, doesnt mean anything. That increase is based on the amount of spirit relative to the amount of intel. Spirit, we have none. If we did, we wouldnt be a spam casting class. Because we are a spam casting class, we have ABSOLUTELY 0 REGEN from spirit.<br />

<br />
That's not what base mana means. Base mana is literally the base. You know when you'd level and it'd say &quot;You gain 64 mana and blahblah health&quot;? That's what its referring to. So it's reduced as the current mana cost of Blink is 28% of base mana.</div></div><hr />

My blink spell (human mage 4226 mana naked) costs 627, that's 15% of base mana. This 21% of base mana is a NERF. Plain and simple. It works out to 882 mana for me, that's 225 MORE mana. WTF? didn't they say they are REDUCING the cost? Obviously they don't know what reducing is.</div></div><hr />

Naked mana is not base mana...<br />
<br />
Intellect gives mana on top of base mana, even base intellect does that so remove the mana gained from intellect from your naked mana and that should be your base mana, I think. You'll find that blink costs a lot less now =)</div></div><hr />

Nope - Im just beeing realistic. Ive been holy paladin from day one with over 200 days played. All instances and Im probably one of the first person to be picked for any of our encounters. That does not mean I now have the same healing powers that I had before compared to other healing classes. Now Paladins are becoming the effective healing class while the others can throw out heals left right and center with all players piled up. Overhealing of over 70% is standard from priest perspective now. It doesn't make them great players. It just means they can spam group heals. <br />
<br />
We still loose half the raid when they have to shield someone cause they are looking at how great they are on healing meters. :P Thats not skill - thats thinking you are uber cause you are not using your abilites to keep players alive. THats simualre to a paladin refusing to cleanse ppl. <br />
<br />
But its always nice to see a Priest who is just happy for his own arse as long as there are 6 priests in raid. Thats all that is needed to say about your arguments.</div></div><hr />

To an extent this is the result of meters - if damage meters can be pretty bad if misused, healing meters can be twice as damaging. Sadly this type of thinking seems to be unavoidable sometimes.</div></div><hr />

Show me any raid that regularly takes 6 priests over say one or two. In fact tonight we only ran with one priest (me) for Kael. Paladins have FAR better stacking ability than priests and this has been the reason that most guilds will only take two and maybe just one to a raid (Fort, CoH/Imp spirit).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tell your guild to stack the pala buffs from alts outside TK before you go for Kael. Then you might realise how important it is to have a Paladin standing inside....<br />
<br />
Your talking TK - a very simple place. And if you can't use your abilites in a fight like Kael witch is multipahsed - where ALL the diffrent abilites of the priests can shine the most. Then omg - your guild really has some poor priests.<br />
<br />
Wait till you get to MH and BT and then you see the important of having diffrent abilites. <br />
<br />
THere are over 3 months since my guild last took less than 3 priests in raid. Usually its 4-5. Considering that there are 2 DIFFRENT specs of priests then I dont see why holy priests are complaining not having 3 holy prirests in every single raid. 3 players from each class is norm in 25 man content - if you didn't realise that. And yes 4-5 of same class is over the top. Maybe consider it seeing 4 warriors in every single raid. Thats also two way class. You dont see anything wrong with that ? 4-5 priests and 4-5 warriors? 8-10 spots out of 25 for 2 classes. <br />
<br />
We have 7 active priests in our raiding guild - 2 shadow and 5 holy. Compare that to 5 palas. 2 prot and 3 holy. 4 druids. 2 healing ones. 5 shamans. 2 healing ones. We have killed Illidan. In fact we did so without one single healing shaman first kill. And you are crying about what exaclty ? You beeing not viable enough or because Paladins are now pointing out that after 4 consecutive patches of nerfs while others are beeing buffed - it might actually be time to rethink and see whats going on in high end raiding ? <br />

<br />
And you dissagreed - and I pointed out why I think your wrong. So ? <br />
<br />
If a class becomes at any point so useless that a buff outside instance instead of bringing them with you into raid becomes a real possibility - then there is defenelty something wrong. We are now at that stage in terms of holy paladins. You dont see it but I can. It has nothing to do with my skills or other players skills. It has to do with the ability of the class to perform in diffrent fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry If I come off as an ass . Didnt realise my comment come off sounding that way.<br />
<br />
My point was there was a very easy way to confirm if it was a buff or not - log on to the current build of the PTR and check yourself ;)<br />
<br />
If you want me to I can check myself today sometime ;) (will have to be later as I got attacked last night and have to replace some stuff i was carrying)</div></div><hr />
