2014 Blizzard Stream Awards, Powered by Twitch<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/march/blizzardStream.jpg <br />
<br />
In 2014, the Twitch streaming community grew and provided countless hours of entertainment to viewers, much of it based on Blizzard games. To recognize the efforts of your favorite streamers and channels, Blizzard is proud to announce the 2014 Blizzard Stream Awards powered by Twitch. These awards will provide recognition and cash prizes for the best Blizzard content streamers of 2014.<br />
<br />
Award nominees will be announced on Tuesday, March 10, and award winners will be announced on Wednesday, March 18, right here on Blizzard’s official community sites and on Blog.Twitch.tv (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/18208581/Blog.Twitch.tv).<br />
<br />
For a list of awards categories and to learn how the 2014 Blizzard Stream Awards powered by Twitch works, check out the breakdown below.<br />
<br />
How It Works<br />
<br />
Award Categories: Together, Blizzard and Twitch have established 21 unique award categories representing streamers from five Blizzard franchises (Diablo III, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, StarCraft II, and World of Warcraft). Six of these categories are data-driven (example: Most number of hours streamed for Blizzard titles in 2014) while the others are qualitative categories that will be voted on by you, the community of viewers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Prizes: In this program, Twitch will distribute a prize pool of approximately $113,700 for 2014 Twitch partner streamers, with the first place winners in each category taking home $2014.<br />
<br />
<br />
Implementation: Voting will occur for the polled categories through Noon PDT on Tuesday, March 17, 2015, via the polls linked below. After voting has closed, we will announce the winners of both the polled categories and the data-driven categories.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rules: To qualify for the 2014 Blizzard Stream Awards presented by Twitch, you must be a Twitch partner streamer (http://www.twitch.tv/p/partners) who streamed game content from one of these five Blizzard franchises: Diablo III, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, StarCraft II, and World of Warcraft between January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014.<br />
<br />

Vote: Favorite New WoW Streamer in 2014<br />
Since when was BlondieWondie a new WoW Streamer? Pretty sure she has been streaming longer than lets say Taymoo has. Why is she even on this list if she's not a new WoW streamer?<br />
<br />
BlondieWondie started streaming WoW in February of 2014. Taymoo (http://www.twitch.tv/taymoo) got started in May of 2014.

Vote: Favorite WoW PvE Streamer in 2014<br />
this contest just shows up hor oblivious blizzard really is considering they have Dexter_bl AND Seriousgaming (same person LOL). and of course allinity who just shows her cleavage but u know thats a great stream nowadays... how is spartysmallwood who does nothing but stream high progresion raiding while teaching the wow community at the same time NOT on this list?! Blizzard seriously hire some competant ppl aready!<br />
All of the listed nominees reached above a certain threshold of popularity for all of 2014, as defined numerically by Twitch. In 2014, both the Dexter_bl channel and the Seriousgaming channel were among the X most-popular channels streaming World of Warcraft more than Y% of the time. As was Alinity.<br />
<br />
I personally really like SpartySmallWood, and hope he climbs into the highest echelon of WoW streamers in 2015. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/364470-vote-favorite-wow-pve-streamer-in-2014/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16544394937?page=4#66))<br />
<br />
Trade Chat<br />
There are a number of things in place that already make it difficult for gold spammers to be a nuisance for long, as well as tools for players to help us clean them up such as the report function. It's something we're always looking at, working on, and improving so that we can make the game environment better for people who just want to play (like you). We also have to be careful not to impact regular players by restricting chat too harshly.<br />
<br />
Thats right money, you enjoy their subs and game fees too much<br />
That classic misconception has been thrown around a lot and I want to avoid repeating myself so I'll just link to what I previously said. <br />
<br />
We do know about the disconnection issue and it's being worked on. We're just as keen to resolve it as you all are, I assure you. In the meantime, as some people here have suggested, addons can help with limiting what you seen in chat channels. But I will once again highlight that we're always working to improve things, and we thank you for leaving feedback about it.

I see a lot of people claim they only spend 2-3 hours a day, if that on wow. Some &quot;Hardcore&quot; raiders even claim as little as 6 hours a week. <br />
If you really are only spending that much time in game, that 45 hours turns into a lot of days worth of game play.</div></div><hr />

Why? Do you know 30 days strings use same prefix (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4752-Patch-6-1-2-PTR-Build-19711-CC-DR-Changes-Blue-Tweets-Patch-6-1-Known-Issues)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is assuming that the time will only be deducted while actively playing, instead of just going &quot;okay, your account is active for the next 45 hours, have fun&quot;. Sadly there's not really too much info to build on, it could go either way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if it's 45 consecutive hours it's still very useful token. Wake up at saturday morning, use token, now you can play until monday. Repeat next weekend. Isn't it great?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering that not even normal one-shots you, LFR should be a joke.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
The 45 hour string is most likely for use in the asia game tokens, seeing as how their more popular method of buying game time is by actually buying play time instead of 30 days. They use a dual model often because some people like to get more value out of buying 45 hours if they only have an hour or so to play a day, or can only play on the weekends, meaning their $15 pays for more than a month of actual play time for them.</div></div><hr />

My new source of income, I have no issue with throwing some of my hard earned cash at the token market for some gold, means I won't ever have to do boring daily chores again to make gold.</div></div><hr />

Man I love how these April Fools Jokes for WOW from the beginning of the game are now becoming reality. IF whoever create those April Fools jokes for the wow homepage they should rename themselves the oracle of wow.<br />
<br />
This is getting retarded, now rewards for people who make people watch them to play video games, what next? We gonna watch people who watch TV for their reactions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a choice when your not influenced or have a neutral stance when presented by both sides of the argument, however your doing the same thing as those people, putting words in my mouth thus your influencing me to go on your side due to guilt. <br />
<br />
Like the Method world's first argument &quot;terms of use&quot; does not equal &quot;terms of service&quot; and now your associating &quot;make&quot; with &quot;forced&quot; bad boy go back to school and look up the meaning of those words, best thing about forums you can't change what you written or said before you realized your mistake.</div></div><hr />

Your canned responses are why people don't believe you. Prioritize the fix. You've been making excuses for it, for years now. <br />
<br />
It's going to reach the boiling point, and that point is close. Bots and interrupt scripts and gold spam are everywhere, and all the players get is &quot;we're working on it.&quot; Work harder. FIX IT. <br />
<br />
Diablo 3 is in the same boat, I logged in last night, and there's so much spam from one website, chat is now useless in the game. You can report them, ignore them, and new names pop up. If screen burn was still an issue, I'd worry that their constantly spammed message would be burned into my screen, it never leaves the chat pane! <br />
<br />
Fix it, or hire some more GMs to monitor chat. It's that simple. Spend some of the billions you're making. It's way past the time where &quot;We're working on it&quot; has any meaning.</div></div><hr />
