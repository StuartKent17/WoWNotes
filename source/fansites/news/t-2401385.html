Old Talent Trees<br />
For me the most annoying thing I hear is when people say the older talent trees were better and gave more choices when we all know it was really an illusion of choice given that for the most part was very cookie cutter. I do admit though that the good thing about them was it felt like you were continuously rewarded every level but the idea that they gave more &quot;choice&quot; wasn't really accurate given how it naturally filtered into set builds. I firmly believe that the modern talent trees are better in the since that your choices do feel very impactful and they overall give you far more utility than the original trees did. Being able to adjust my toolkit slightly to fill a certain niche feels really good when it does happen and its something that I feel very engaged on trying to figure out.<br />
<br />
Just an extra note this is a good thread but lets try to keep it civil here and avoid the name calling.<br />
<br />
Yes, I do agree with you, to a point. For PvE, you betcha.<br />
I didn't PvP that much until after the talent revamp so you might be right in that you could create some quirky builds that were fun. <br />
<br />
If the early talent trees weren't impactful then why were there &quot;set builds&quot; using them?<br />
While I implied it I didn't directly say that, however you can have set builds and still feel like the decisions you're making aren't that impactful as a whole. It becomes more of a situation of &quot;these builds work so you pretty much have to do this as anything else isn't as viable&quot;. Versus me deciding to change up a choice of say what kind of Beacon talent to use (I know they aren't all like this but its an example).<br />
<br />
I do miss having actual points to spend in talents (not necessarily having so many talents themselves) to make an ability stronger.<br />
Yeah that is the only thing I actually miss about them. It was nice feeling like you were continually rewarded even though it majority of the time was something simple like &quot;2% more Shadow Word: Pain damage&quot; or &quot;1% more Stamina&quot; <br />

Holy Priest feedback<br />
We've seen a lot of feedback on Apotheosis (and level 100 generally) after the talent swap. 2 changes in next build:<br />
<br />
--Duration 20s and cooldown 2min (from 30s and 3min). The shorter cooldown is likely worth a lot more than 10s of added duration, in terms of how you usually want to use it to deliver strong healing for a situation that doesn't necessarily last 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
--The bonus is +300% rather than +200%. This matches the strength that it has on live when Light of the Naaru is taken. Apotheosis didn't need to be weakened outright, and can have the synergy with Light of the Naaru baked in, now that you can't take both.

All eight teams will now go head-to-head in a race to the finish until just one team is left: the Mythic Dungeon Invitational Global Champions!<br />

What's Next<br />
The top two teams from each region will travel to the MLG Arena in Columbus, Ohio to take part in the first ever Mythic Dungeon Invitational LAN event, broadcast live June 22–24. See the full schedule on the Mythic Dungeon Invitational site here.<br />
<br />
We’ve received a lot of great feedback from players and the community over the course of the Mythic Dungeon Invitational, and we’ve made a few additional changes to shake things up for the finals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Keystone levels are going even higher. Competitors will take on +23, +24, and +25 as the bracket progresses.<br />
All three Affixes are locked in per map.<br />
Maps have been shuffled between the map pools.<br />
To keep things interesting, we’ve shuffled some of your favorite affixes to keep competitors on their toes.<br />
We’ve reintroduced Skittish and added some additional variety overall.<br />
Artifact Weapons now scale up to 995.<br />
<br />
<br />
We’ve also revisited some of our policies regarding how we handle potential in-game bugs and issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the event occurring via LAN with players on-site, verifiable technical issues such as hardware failures or internet instability may result in a remake, depending on the impact and severity of the issue.<br />
If an in-game bug or issue occurs that prevents a player from being able to continue play due to game physics, such as getting stuck in terrain, a remake will be called.<br />
Issues that will not lead to a restart include: creatures evading or resetting, hitting the wrong target with spells or melee attacks, or buffs/debuffs being applied incorrectly.<br />
<br />
<br />
A lot is on the line at the MDI Global Finals, and we look forward to having you tune in for this historic first Mythic Dungeon Invitational LAN competition!<br />
<br />
But that’s not all we have in store. We’re excited to reveal that there’s even more on the line.<br />
<br />
We’re excited to announce the Mythic Dungeon Invitational All-Stars, a special live exhibition tournament that summons some of the best dungeon-running teams from around the globe to BlizzCon 2018! We’re bringing the worlds of the MDI and the WoW Arena World Championship together in Anaheim for the first time ever, and WoW esports fans are in for a truly epic weekend.<br />
<br />
The top four teams from the MDI Global Finals will be invited to the MDI All-Stars, where they’ll tackle the newest Battle for Azeroth dungeons live on stage in front of thousands of attendees and esports fans watching online. This will be the first MDI tournament to feature Battle for Azeroth, so get ready for a whole new set of dungeons, bosses, and cunning strategies.<br />
<br />
If your favorite team doesn’t make it to the All-Stars event, don’t worry—this will just be the start of the MDI competition for the new expansion. After Battle for Azeroth launches later this year, we’ll share more information on our MDI plans, including the full schedule and format of the All-Stars event and how to compete in future events. Stay tuned!<br />

This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Mists of Pandaria Animations<br />
WoW’s 4th expansion, Mists of Pandaria introduced numerous new abilities to all the classes in the game. These new abilities were featured throughout a series of videos. While some of them you might be familiar with, there have been many interesting ones which have been removed throughout recent expansions.<br />
<br />

<br />
Project Titan<br />
A secret MMO, codename “Titan” was leaked from Blizzard in 2011. Many people expected this new game to debut around 2014, however in an interview with Venturebeat, Shon Damron stated that the project has been reset. Many of the developers that were working on the project were reassigned to other teams. After this announcement, most people were expecting the game to be pushed back a few years. In later talks about the Titan, it was mentioned that this marked the end of the project, but many of the assets were used in the development of Overwatch.<br />
<br />

<br />
Your Base on Draenor<br />
A series of Blue posts in 2014 previewed one of the biggest additions to the game in Warlords of Draenor. The Garrison system was influenced by the RTS days of Warcraft, giving players a way of building their own base. Garrisons would play a critical role in the leveling and end-game experience during the expansion by bringing a variety of building types that affect the gameplay in different ways. The process of building this new base consists of recruiting followers, and acquiring blueprints for new, and improved buildings.<br />

<br />
Patch 6.2 Mounts<br />
The last content patch of Warlords of Draenor added a few new mounts to the game. The Bristling Hellboar was a reward for reaching Exalted with The Saberstalkers, but it cost 5000 Blackfang Claw. The second mount was the Reins of the Corrupted Dreadwing, which could be purchased in Tanaan Jungle for a mere 150,000 Apexis Crystals. Mythic raiders who defeated Archimonde were rewarded with a Felsteel Annihilator, and even though only one dropped per kill, they had plenty of time to ensure everyone in the raid got one.<br />

Mad Merchant<br />
Legion introduced a vendor in Dalaran, who is only available during specific times. This Mad Merchant sells a toy, a bag, a companion, and a mount, all of which cost an absurd amount of gold. The Bloodfang Cocoon is still a unique mount model available only for players with pockets deep enough to afford it.<br />

Overwatch - Honest Trailer<br />
Smosh Games released their Overwatch Honest Trailer in 2016, where they make fun of the clear resemblances between Overwatch and other similar games. The video is filled with jokes, while giving a pretty accurate representation of the game during the time it was recorded.<br />

Most of the &quot;problems&quot; with the talent tree only applied to raiding. Every other aspect of the game could utilize various hybrid combos. While the late-vanilla rework paved way for more raid viability, it effectively crippled choice for &quot;Raid or die&quot; mentality. PvP was never balanced (ie AV, CC, stealth) so no point even arguing that.<br />
<br />
Do raiding parrots really not understand, especially with the tier sets, that raiding was meant to be a specific challenge imposed by the developer? Maybe some people just like being told what to do, when to do it, how to do it, and never asking why--but not me. That's not playing a game; that's just going through the motions. Carrot on a stick, but with a random chance for someone else to take the carrot just before you reach it and proceeding to go through the entire process again unconsciously.</div></div><hr />

I mean for bfa blizzard wants to try and change a few things, they used mages as an example. So currently when you spec with a mage all your abilities are in that school of magic. I believe blizzard said something along the lines of, if you are an arcane mage you should have other abilities too, cause you aren't just Arcane you are a Mage as well. So now say you have both talent trees and you are an arcane mage, well you can go put points in the arcane tree just to be more arcane if you want or you can put them in fire or frost so you aren't just arcane you can have more fire or frost stuff.</div></div><hr />

We still have cookie cutter builds with the new talent system. So what is the point of using the new ones when both have cookie cutter builds. There will alwas be cookie cutter builds unless you put ONLY utility spells in there which do not alter your damage/mitigation/healing but only add a form of CC or buff or whatever, a port, a cooldown reduction on some CC spells like they did in bfa currently. <br />
You will ALWAYS have cookie cutter talents when its about numbers and to min/max. Or you make the same talent 3 times, give them the same numbers but just different names, so we have a real illusion of choice... There is no choice, it is a FORCED choice that not we do as a player, it is dictated by the game and the talent system itself. God damn, Blizzard is so dumb sometimes. Especially on dead and useless talents. They INSIST on keeping it in and not replacing it. Like Surrender to madness for example. This insisting on such things is what annoys me the most, because it will take them YEARS to finally understand something.</div></div><hr />

Every movie has multiple versions of the same prop. Lane's armor costume for example had 10 different versions. Only one was sold. So this does not mean anything in concerns to a second movie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you do not understand how that can be better then how it is now, where you wait 15 levels till 90 to get something ''new'' as opposed to something that isn't new but you can do each level (talent points) because it is a ROLE PLAYING GAME where talent trees or points or as such are kind of woven into the genre. What we got now isn't a talent tree, just a unlocking of a ability. Not the same, though I hold my breath if you understand this.. based of yer reaction.</div></div><hr />

what blizzard should do is just put 1 talent tree for each spec but similiar to artifact weapon when eventually at max level you use all aviable &quot;slots&quot; <br />

At least the old talent tree system allowed hybridization and customization in leveling, dungeons and BGs. Now you level a character and go 15 levels without any noticeable increase in player power (especially now with zone scaling and heirloom gear). Raiding is all about maximization so cookie cutter builds will always exist. The current iteration is just lazy and unrewarding<br />
<br />
Well and there in lies the problem. There may still be illusion of choice, but the illusion isn't nearly as good. The system makes leveling fairly unrewarding compared to the old when leveling. Does it make the same impact if not more from abilities? Probably, but generally its broken down into whatever utility you think you like best and whether you are doing an AOE build or single target build. It may change somewhat for PvP, but so did the old system too so that's a wash.<br />
<br />
Now if every choice was equal and they did break it down into each row being for a certain thing then I think the statement would be much closer to reality. They can say what they want, but in the end it was done because it was easier for them to manage and balance. It was done for their benefit, not necessarily for that of the players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before crit became more desirable than mastery? Wow, so interesting design.<br />
<br />
RoS is very situational compared to universally good LI, but OK.<br />
<br />
That's not even a choice, AoE = Misery, Single target = Mindbender.<br />
<br />
Never used SoM because of the death part, but OK, maybe it has its' niche.<br />
<br />
It does not matter if its interesting for you or not or if its situational. There are some choices while you suggested that theres nothing.<br />
<br />
From old talent trees I miss the feeling when you leveled up and you was awarded with the juicy 1 point to spend somewhere. But after this you basically almost never changed talents (except changing spec obviously) even between aoe/st. Was this really better?</div></div><hr />

There is one cookie cutter build that works universally better 95% of the time (minus AoE/ST row, which is binary choice). By comparison, old talent tree had different builds for PvP and PvE for each spec, as well as some talents you played with all the time like +5% to hit or to armor penetration which depended on gear.<br />
<br />

Following that logic, old talent trees gave you enough choice, you had less talent points than you needed to completely fill the tree. Lots of options to fuck up your build.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, so it's a net loss for players overall as it really numbs the leveling experience. end game makes no real difference but there are still 109 levels that precede end game to go through, and I can't imagine what that would feel like for a new player</div></div><hr />

dunkan is a noob, he should atleast read some nfo about characters to feel them, none of the characters in movies were shown how they really are. every player who familiar with warcraft lore would do much better as a producer.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't surprised on how bad the movie was as a Warcraft story, it was just another generic sci-fi / action movie set in the Warcraft Universe.</div></div><hr />

Some of the armour looks nice though. Strange how they looked more plastic-like in the movie itself.</div></div><hr />
