Developer Interview - Battle for Azeroth<br />
Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2018/06/26/top-things-to-do-before-battle-for-azeroth-by-warcrafts-game-director/#1b1e2a4757b0) posted part two of its two part interview with Game Director Ion Hazzikostas about the top things to do in game before Battle for Azeroth launches.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Chromie scenario will be unchanged and the rewards will continue to be available in Battle for Azeroth.<br />
Class mounts aren't going anywhere.<br />
There will be no change to mount and collectible drop rates from outdoor content in Broken Isles or Argus after Legion ends.<br />
The tower challenge was tuned around ~905 ilvl and 50 artifact power levels so the addition of max artifact weapons should help lower the stress of the challenge.<br />
Most of the challenges are about practicing mechanics more than gear, and should be doable with outdoor-Argus level gear.<br />
Mythic Gul'dan and Argus mounts will become rare drops and the Violet Spellwing mount will be unavailable when Battle for Azeroth launches.<br />
Legion Brawler's Guild achievements will be replaced with Battle for Azeroth Brawler's Guild achievements.<br />
If you have 800 skill level in a profession before the patch, you will have all previous expansion's crafting maxed.<br />
If you have 650 skill level in a profession, you'll have 100 in earlier expansions, 50/100 for Warlords of Draenor, and 0/100 for Legion.<br />
Trinket procs and set bonuses will remain functional when the patch goes live.<br />
There are no plans to have events that boost leveling experience in the pre-expansion patch such as the demon invasions.<br />
The team is happy with the overall pace of leveling as of 7.3.5.<br />
Battle for Azeroth should be a little more alt friendly than Legion.<br />
Getting BiS legendaries for your spec and leveling each artifact weapon is no longer an issue, so it should be much easier to keep your other specs relevant.<br />
Blizzard feels that Legion was a truly successful expansions and players in general have been more positive about it than other recent expansions.<br />
The team is excited about the improvements to the gearing system which gives more control to the player and lessen the impact of randomness.<br />
The pre-expansion patch will have the story events and world quests leading up to the burning of Teldrassil.<br />
Catch up gear will be included in the Darkshore world quest rewards for the prepatch event.<br />
The plan is to have the Battle for Lordaeron scenario available a week before launch of the expansion for players that have purchased Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />

Protection Paladin Feedback - Battle for Azeroth<br />
I can say that I am not enjoying Avengers augmenting SoTR... it just seems odd. <br />
<br />
It is odd to begin with. But the fact that it doesn't continue the &quot;bonus&quot; buff if you use SoTR again, is a bit frustrating on top of that.<br />
If you overlap a buffed Shield of the Righteous with an unbuffed one, or vice versa, it should average together the two armor values based on the duration remaining, rather than simply overwriting one with the other. This is similar to how Shield of the Righteous behaved in the past with e.g. temporary mastery buffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Quest Chain Help<br />
I would just like to go on record and say that the quest help and quest progress in general is horrible in wow, simply horrible. half the time you have no clue what you have and have not done, where to pick up a quest line if you dropped it, what is required what is optional.<br />
See, I believe it has improved greatly. Most questlines, especially the important ones, appear on the map so you know to go there and pick it up. If you abandon a quest, the exclamation point often will appear on the map to let you know where to go back to. <br />
<br />
Understand, there will always be some mystery when it comes to questing, since part of playing an MMO is exploring and figuring out for yourself what does what. For those who don't have the patience or desire to do so there are a number of sites where a lot of that information is available, usually figured out by other players. <br />
<br />
That said, as the others have suggested, if you have feedback regarding the experience I'd ask that you submit your suggestions through the in-game option in the help menu or by posting in the relevant section of the forums. For this probably the quest forum would be best.<br />
<br />
What is &quot;required or optional&quot; isn't determined by Blizzard.<br />
I think they mean for situations in which you are trying to do quest Y, but in order to get quest Y you need to do quest A through G in zone 1, plus another two quests in Zone 2 and maybe bring your reputation up to Friendly with faction delta. <br />
<br />
The requirements for a lot of quests, activities, etc... aren't always transparent in MMO's. Though they aren't necessarily intended to be.

Epilepsy - Empowered Artifact Weapon<br />
Thanks for the feedback on this! I've passed this along to the developers but I just wanted to drop a note that I was in the process of cleaning up this thread.<br />
<br />
No two people who suffer from epileptic seizures due to photo sensitivity are triggered by the same things. It could be a &quot;tame&quot; animation to you but causes a nightmare for someone else. Please be aware of that before you make an insensitive comment that causes me to have to delete it and/or suspend you. It's annoying.

This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Legendary Staff<br />
Firelands brought a special item for caster DPS, Dragonwrath, Teracgosa’s Rest. To obtain this legendary item, players had to gain the base version, that was not much more than any other staff which dropped from the raid, however completing a series of quests, most of which were time gated based on collecting items from the raid, the staff became more powerful. After going through three upgrades, the staff reached its final phase, which made it sometimes duplicate harmful spells, and allowed the player to transform into Teracgosa’s Visage.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/thumb/dragonwrath4.jpg (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2290-Dragonwrath-Teracgosa-s-Rest-Preview) <br />
<br />
Fendral’s Flamescythe<br />
Majordomo Staghelm, in the Firelands drops a weapon that was of particular interest to feral druids. For the first time, equipping this weapon completely changed the way druids look in the Cat form. This blazing form was sought by many druids, and later inspired a number of the Artifact Weapon appearances in Legion.<br />
<br />

<br />
Sky Golem<br />
Patch 5.4 introduced a new mount that was craftable by Engineers, but most used by Herbalists. This mount allows players to gather herbs while mounted, making it a luxury item to have, especially at the beginning of new expansions when herb prices tend to be very high.<br />
<br />

<br />
Legendary Rings<br />
The Warlords of Draenor equivalent of the Legendary Cloak were the Rings. Healers, tanks, and DPS all got unique procs that empowered all of the specific roles if one person used it. While only a few players had access to these during the world first rance, the rings contributed to many other guilds defeating the Hellfire Citadel.<br />

<br />
Sun Darter Hatchling<br />
The Sun Darter Hatchling was one of the few very intricate secrets discovered throughout Legion. Acquiring this pet requires players to solve a series of riddles in a hidden cave, and making use of many items from previous expansions. This secret was of course solved, by the Secret Finding Discord, and a full guide was published to navigate players through it.<br />

Personal loot makes it even more RNG for sure. But 1 weapon drop that can only warforge is a hell of a lot better then 3 random pieces of random that can random to any random ilvl. You're much more likely to get a BiS weapon now then in legion. TFing being there is a horse a piece so not really an argument atm.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that players should be happy about leveling pace, not the team. And that's not the case currently. Leveling has been ruined with 7.3.5.</div></div><hr />

You know, I remember having a tier old weapon for the majority of progress during WOTLK, so unless there are bosses that drop only weapons, I wouldn't bank too much on weapons being easy to get. <br />
<br />
I also have 14 heroic Gul'dan kills on my mage, most of them PL runs, most of them using coin too. No trinket or tier legs ever. Relics weren't perfect (mostly because of the huge imbalance among the traits), but they were good in lessening the gap between the haves and have nots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You got unlucky, that's all. And I highly doubt you went through a whole tier with NO weapon drops, probably more like, the weapon you wanted didn't drop. Instead with Relics we had entire tiers were our good relics didn't drop at all, because they weren't on the loot tables, and then they add the NLC to MAYBE get the good traits....<br />

The new azurite armor stuff cannot war or titan forge and specific things and specific places always drop specific types of azurite armor. So if you want a specific azurite helm you can look up what drops is and when you get it to drop it always has the specific abilities set for it and maximum quality.<br />
<br />
So its not like legendaries where it was a total crap shoot on when/if you would get them and you don't have to worry about farming the same azurite armor thing 20 times to try to get the max ilevel titanforged varient of it.<br />

<br />
Having done three alts to max level since that patch this is at best hyperbole. The leveling in the old world is slower but with the scaling basically just figure out a few zones you want to do and then you can actually finish them and get full xp instead of before where everything was grey halfway through any zones quest line. With the changes to the dungeon xp if you just throw yourself in the queue for each dungeon at least once and do the zones leveling still goes pretty damn fast. The higher you get the faster it gets WOD takes only a couple hours to finish and legion not much longer than that if you can get some luck with demonic invasions.</div></div><hr />

Haven't done any questing at content that isn't current for years and don't plan to. And dungeon leveling is ruined with 7.3.5. Dungeons take ages to complete and reward so little exp now. On top of that heirlooms nerfed to uselessness and 300% RAF bonus gone.</div></div><hr />

There is a simple reason why they made the leveling harder than in vanilla (1-60 was faster in the old times than 1-110 without looms now) = money. I know at least 5 people in my average 10-14 online players guild who payed 60$ for boost because they couldn't bothered with the new &quot;hardcore&quot; leveling. When the allied races came into the game almost half of my guild boosted at least one so there was another 60$ pay out.<br />
<br />
Of course they are happy because they made lots of money...<br />
The only time when the devs are forced to the things for the players is when the company loses money which will never happen I think because they earn 60-70x more money than they invest into it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhm yes you can rush a lot of dungeons. All the buff has done is made most mobs meat shields and nothing more.<br />
<br />
The scaling itself is fine. The changes to health were unnecessary because there is still no danger in the world when the mobs are still hitting for the same amount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then that is not the fault of the instance.<br />
<br />
You can easily rush the dungeons. All the buff has done is increase the hp values in most upto at least 70-80.<br />
<br />
Cata ones are the only ones with a semblance of danger now because they were always intended to have mechanics like that.<br />
<br />
The changes to levelling are good in some aspects and bad in the others.<br />
<br />
Scaling? Great change being able to level where you want for the most part.<br />
<br />
Health values? Not needed unless you intended to buff outdoor mob damage to make the world a challenge again. And in most dungeons Pre Cata also unnecessary.</div></div><hr />

Not the point being made.<br />
<br />
The point you made was that dungeons are hard. That is only the case for a select few due to their design by default.<br />
<br />
Anything 80 or lower or even Mists/WoD ones are mostly just meat shield mobs and bosses.</div></div><hr />

You aren't though. You are perfectly entitled to an opinion.<br />
<br />
As I said I'm happy with the scaling itself. I love being able to do Silverpine at 50.<br />
<br />
However the health changes for the most part were not needed. It is still quick to level but it's a change that wasn't needed unless you buffed mob damage to make them dangerous again. Even in non heirlooms mobs aren't a threat.<br />
<br />
I know what I want. I personally want the health changes reverting or the mob damage buffing.</div></div><hr />

What's sad is that the fastest way to level completely subverts and exploits the scaling for its maximum speed rather than its intended slow-down effect. It's still not quite as fast as things used to be, where you could stack both EXP pots, heirlooms, RAF and get 5 levels per dungeon run. That's one of the few places I agree with Blizzard about leveling: it WAS broken. Now you have the option of speed-leveling or taking your time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was broken because of RAF, and RAF alone. Heirlooms still boost experience, and experience potions are still available to those that still have them. <br />
<br />
In fact, I still strongly believe we'll start seeing them on the Blizzard store come Battle for Azeroth as a paid service; why else would people buy them when boosts are available? Oh right, allied races have to be leveled to get their armor... hmm...<br />
<br />
My issue isn't with the leveling speed itself, though, but rather with the tedium in killing enemies, and that Blizzard has essentially guaranteed that the least effective way to level will be questing from here on out. It's a convoluted mess and Blizzard is &quot;happy&quot; with it. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
That's not to say this is targeted at you though, I just feel that there is far too much praise towards the leveling changes, like they are making the game 'fun' with these changes. IMHO, the enemies need to be toned down while leveling; it feels ridiculous that the easiest point in the game is maximum level. And that's saying nothing of how badly tuned enemies are, especially in WoD, making even single enemies a struggle if you picked the wrong class and/or are having bad luck with gear. <br />
<br />
The entire idea of how leveling up no longer means anything is a complete joke as well, and gearing up is an endlessly uphill battle; the more effectively you level, the harder it is to play the game. In a sense, heirlooms are more critical now than they've ever been before... I will say that I enjoy being able to pick an expansion to level in (who doesn't dream of skipping TBC?), and that you have more freedom in picking zones, but there needs to be more tiers, or if they aren't willing to do that, just let people pick any zone they want instead of specific expansions. Might as well go all out.<br />
<br />
I should reiterate; I think changes were needed, but Blizzard went overkill and virtually everyone knows it. Seeing them post that &quot;They are happy with the leveling speed&quot; is truly sad. I'm just waiting for them to announced experience potions on the Blizzard store. I hope it gets the outrage it deserves. If Blizzard cared at all about how people felt, they would mention that they are thinking about changes, or considering adjustments, or at least working on making questing in later expansions more viable. It's anything but perfect right now.<br />
<br />
PS: Thanks for the guide, though. Seriously. Things like that are more helpful than ever before; knowing bits like how to skip Warlords of Draenor instead of slogging through that awful nightmare is like night and day when leveling (I'm assuming that's in your guide, point is that tips like these make a world of difference with how bad leveling is now).<br />

The reason you are being called a troll is not because you are expressing an opinion they disagree with; the reason you are being called a troll is because you are badmouthing what you are aware most people like as the best expansion of World of Warcraft and calling Legion amazing -- which is as obvious as baiting can get -- and not even expressing why you think Legion is so good... or why WotLK is bad.<br />
<br />
In short, you are acting like a troll... intentionally or accidentally, it doesn't really make much difference.<br />

Don't worry, friend, you can buy Battle for Azeroth and get the digital version in advance! Blizzard will even let you donate a copy of the game to a friend! :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Unless you've been collecting all of the collector's editions since day one, or they simply have something you want very badly in them, I don't see much point in going after them anymore. I don't feel they are even remotely worth the price... but that's just my biased opinion. The fact that Blizzard doesn't care about screwing over their most dedicated fans that buy CE's (which I am not, and have not been) is kind of ironic. It's a new trend for them, and one I cannot fathom.</div></div><hr />

I hesitate to agree with this. Not because I don't believe it could happen, but because I think as profit-focused as Blizzard has been lately, even they'd recognize the direct outrage that this would cause. Players will put up with a lot, but removing EXP pots as drops and putting them into the paid store won't go over well. <br />
<br />
While that doesn't REALLY make a lot of logical sense(given that you can just buy a 110 boost directly) the community is already pretty riled up about how many things have been taken away from them or pruned. Taking away things and reselling them in the cash shop is just over the top. <br />

One of the few things I'm interested in BfA is testing the leveling process under War Mode to see if the bonus exp combined with PVP talents will make questing fast enough to contend with other methods. <br />
<br />
As someone with experience on both PVP and PVE realms, I don't have much trouble avoiding PVP outside of the occasional gank. Most times I don't even really see enemy players. I suppose that could change under the new combined realms and shards, but we'll see. <br />
<br />
However, to get back to the point that I just quoted: I tend to agree. I said that the old leveling system was broken, not that I thought the new system was particularly good outside of the more broad range of choices you have when leveling up. I LIKE the way the open world scales with you so you don't have to feel forced to leave zones early. But I dislike the way mob health and time-to-kill seem bloated in relation to how player-character power increases.<br />
<br />
Again, my views might change depending on how well War Mode works. Although even if warmode makes questing feel speedy and empowering again, it will come at the potential cost of being ganked(which I know MANY people absolutely can not tolerate). It definitely seems like the leveling process still needs some work. <br />

I mean that, instead of trying to quest or dungeon through WoD (which is currently terribly balanced for leveling), you can collect treasures and do bonus quests to rush through it very quickly. You are 'skipping' WoD in that sense.<br />

As for the rest of your post, War Mode is a curious thing. I don't think it is going to have a dramatic impact on leveling, and if it's popular, well... there will be a lot of people using it, leading to people using it to gank other players, leading to it perhaps slowing things down a bit. War Mode gives an exp bonus because PvP has the risk of slowing things down, after all. I do like that they added these bonuses to War Mode, however; without it, I think PvP phases would be completely empty while leveling, as there would be no point in doing it.<br />
<br />
Lastly, well... we'll see on the experience potions. I personally think Blizzard is waiting for things to blow over before they announce them. They've done things before that would have caused an outrage had they released them at an inopportune time (or at least, a worse outrage than it could have been) and it's certainly not as if Blizzard hasn't made decisions in the past solely for revenue, rather than player retention/game quality. I hope they don't, honestly, but I will not be even remotely surprised if they do. I mean, look at WoW tokens and character boosts.</div></div><hr />

I fully expect experience from treasures in WoD to be needed hard at some point in BfA.

The entire concept of using the incentive of PVE rewards to promote PVP is deeply flawed. Trying to mix the purpose of pve leveling with PvP ganking is likewise flawed. It always has been, even on PvP servers. <br />
<br />
I'm just glad it's an option that can be turned on or off at will so when people inevitably get sick of bottom feeding gankers that can't handle area or battlegrounds, they can just not deal with it. That alone will be healthy for the game.<br />

They've done things before that would have caused an outrage had they released them at an inopportune time (or at least, a worse outrage than it could have been) and it's certainly not as if Blizzard hasn't made decisions in the past solely for revenue, rather than player retention/game quality. I hope they don't, honestly, but I will not be even remotely surprised if they do. I mean, look at WoW tokens and character boosts.<br />
<br />
It's inevitable. All it really is right now is a matter of timing. At what point will the subs drop low enough that the lack of MAUs and sub profits have to be made up somehow.</div></div><hr />

I am completely find with this, as long as Blizzard also takes the time to tune down the content so that questing becomes viable as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
The entire concept of using the incentive of PVE rewards to promote PVP is deeply flawed. Trying to mix the purpose of pve leveling with PvP ganking is likewise flawed. It always has been, even on PvP servers. <br />
<br />
I'm just glad it's an option that can be turned on or off at will so when people inevitably get sick of bottom feeding gankers that can't handle area or battlegrounds, they can just not deal with it. That alone will be healthy for the game.<br />
True. I mean that it's more likely there to make world PvP exist at all, because if there were no rewards, no benefit for participating, literally no one would do it. Only masochistic people (and hey, there are at least a few out there, but they'd be bored because no one else would be there with them).<br />
<br />
If I am not mistaken, though, your character's stats are adjusted in a sense that you will be able to fight anyone on equal terms (presumably within the level range) instead of being ganked by someone on the upper end of the zone. (Otherwise the entire system is flawed and Blizzard may as well not bother with it to begin with. :p)<br />

Blizzard has already tested selling experience potions on the PTRs IIRC. But that may have been specifically for other regions -- which already sell those experience potions. I can't fathom why else they would be handling the allied races' heritage armor the way they are, and likewise making the leveling experience significantly more tedious and slower intentionally.<br />
<br />
In honesty, I hope I'm wrong. But it feels like there's writing on the wall, and I've seen these sorts of things play out before.</div></div><hr />

Sadly, that's not how Blizzard works. Their M.O. is to nerf or remove anything that doesn't fit the way they want people to play. They aren't interested in giving players options other than what fits within their strict definition of that, especially under Ion. Look at what happened with Flight and why there isn't any relaxing of the requirement for WoD or Legion pathfinder, despite being non-current expansions. Look at what's happening with ML/PL. Look at all the feedback that was ignored about how bad layered RNG is with Legendaries, the NLC, and now Azerite gear. <br />
<br />
Like I said, I fully expect Blizzard to nerf or remove treasure-based exp in order to force leveling players into questing or dungeons, without any kind of rebalancing or changes in other areas to compensate. <br />

There hasn't been any reason to engage in World PVP since battlegrounds were introduced. War Mode allowing PVP talents to be added on to PVE builds is, as I said, fundamentally flawed. Even with scaling that puts player stats on an even playing field, the builds and mentality for PVP and PVE are completely different. <br />
<br />
PVP focuses on burst damage. PVE focuses on sustain. <br />
PVE players will already be engaged with NPC enemies when the ganker attacks, putting them at further disadvantage. <br />
PVE players are in a mental state of attacking AI and farming rep/gear/objectives, PVP gankers are hunters looking for easy meat. <br />
PVE levelers are often solo players. Gankers often run in groups. <br />
<br />
The only way PVP works in the open world is if the entire thing is built from the ground up to support it. And that's what battlegrounds do. Simply tacking PVP onto an otherwise 100% PVE design is a bad idea. <br />

Frankly I'm surprised they didn't already start. But maybe they figure race swap payments are already enough? Or it could be a case of timing the release for maximum effect.</div></div><hr />
