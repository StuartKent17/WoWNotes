You need three of your followers to be holding 675 ilvl gear along with having two major traits (Danger-zone etc.) for each that matches the ones required by the mission, so it ain't easy getting it.</div></div><hr />

I never said it was easy. (But it is easy, it just is time consuming to get followers up there.) I was more complaining about the RNG of it. I had more than enough followers maxed at 675 mere days after 6.1 hit, but it still took forever for the second selfie mission to appear. Even though I had already completed the achievement associated with the camera. And I knew of people who were literally ignoring the selfie missions because they didn't care about it. Meanwhile, I was sitting there waiting for it for months and had even put in effort that involved the camera. It's dumb. The camera toy turner thing should be tied to the achievement, not a random mission.<br />
<br />
<br />
as opposed to having to run old content for mount drops?<br />
Running old raids is a much better situation. Look at it this way: to get a raid mount drop, you kill the boss and hope it drops. To get a specific garrison mission reward (i.e. this mount), you have to visit your mission table once a day or every few hours or whatever and just hope it appears. There's no skill or even entertainment involved. It's waiting for a list to show you what you want. You may be cynical enough to equate running an old raid to waiting for a list to show you what you want (a loot window being the list in this case), but at least you are experiencing an area that time was put into (art, mechanic design, etc etc). The garrison mission list is practically none of those things.</div></div><hr />

Mounts were so cool back at the start of the game because not everyone had them. Having an epic mount was a big deal, let alone having an epic mount that wasnt part of your faction. I get that Bliz wanted to add more cool stuff to the pot for everyone to have but there are like 300 mounts now. Non of them feel special after earning them.<br />
<br />
I wish Bliz didnt abandon its roots so hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do everyone care so much about what other players they dont have to have any contact with get? <br />
<br />
First it was the whine about mythic caches and now some random mount. Play the game to your own liking and don't concern yourself what some random people on different realms wear or ride. Special snowflake sybdrome is getting out of hand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Gronnling mounts have an exceptionally ape-like gait, both in walk and run mode, and even their idle isn't too out of place.<br />
<br />
It would be quite easy to have a reskinned and scale-adjusted Gronnling skeleton as the basis for rideable gorillas.</div></div><hr />

So Blizzard why am I enjoying that more, than WoW? Hmmm...? <br />
<br />
Well anyway hope it releases soon, because I really want to play something new, than playing the same thing over and over again with my chars. <br />
That is why too probably I got really emotional. I don't usually get too emotional, so still get this patch out soon, and soon everyone will be happy. <br />
<br />
Some things too that could fix WoW; <br />
<br />
-Make Garrison Blueprints account wide so when one of your chars gets it the other alts get it for free. Kinda like a pay-off<br />
-Make Questing more enjoyable and let the players they want to play their class. If they want to be a battle-mage, or even a healing tank let them be those. <br />
-Make Dungeons, Raids, more enjoyable and add more content. Kinda like add a little quest hub like you did for Class Quests for certain Dungeons, but do it for more. <br />
-Have the player experience themselves involving themselves with the game more, by actually having the Seasons change like some people did say. Seasons for certain quest zones, dungeons, and raids will be neat.</div></div><hr />

How hard can this be from a developer's standpoint to make? Seriously, I could make a mission to the moon and outerspace and wherever... these follower missions are just txt and you gotta RP in your mind that they are happening. Boring as hell and I hate that such a huge part of patch 6.2 is the emphasis on this.<br />

It is accurate. I got the actual camera (that stays in your bags) within 48 hours. But I didn't get the Mark II upgrade (which turns it into a toy) for over a month. My point was that it took forever to get the upgrade, even though I had completed the achievement that most people probably didn't bother with. I just felt like the &quot;prize&quot; should have been linked to the achievement seeing as I clearly showed that I wanted it but didn't get it. Which I know comes off as me complaining. I just disagree with the philosophy in this particular instance.</div></div><hr />
