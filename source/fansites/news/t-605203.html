If you've been watching PTR raid progression closely, you probably know that the next boss to kill is M'uru. There isn't much progression on him for the moment, however there is something interesting in the game files : a boss named Entropius !<br />
<br />
Now, take a look at the first screenshot and see if you notice something unusual between the two monsters ? Nothing ? Check the 2nd screenshot. <br />

<br />
Of course that's some crazy speculation, but the similarities between the two monsters are really strange and it's not like Entropius could fit anywhere else in the Sunwell Plateau ... the next boss after M'uru being Kil'jaeden. Based on the information I've got I'd say that M'uru has been corrupted by Entropius, and you'll have to fight both of them in the Sunwell Plateau (with Entropius appearing in a later phase of the fight). <br />

2.4 Item changes<br />

Wrath of the Lich King - The Tuskarr<br />
A few days ago, the official WotLK site has been updated with an article about Tuskarrs (http://www.wow-europe.com/wrath/features/factions/tuskarr.xml).<br />
Despite the absence of any records documenting the tuskarr's past, many significant facts have recently come to light.<br />
<br />
The tuskarr are a kind-natured nomadic race that roams the southern coastlines of Northrend, guided by the carved cyclopean statues that mark their seasonal fishing routes. The tuskarr's tribal affiliation is evidenced by the sigils inscribed on their tusks, and although they are a peaceful race, they are constantly beset by taunka and local murlocs.<br />
<br />
Yet even their enemies marvel at the tuskarr's prowess and fearlessness in catching some of the most dangerous creatures in Northrend's frigid waters, including whales and giant squid. Not even the unnamed leviathans that lurk in the ocean's depths are beyond the tuskarr's reach.<br />
<br />
The tuskarr have seen their share of difficult times, but with the Horde's recent arrival they have found a new ally in the ongoing struggle against the hostile forces of Northrend.<br />

Mate, it's common knowledge ;]<br />
&quot;In accordance with the Naaru life cycle, D'ore's body became a shadowy void which attracts and consumes souls.&quot;<br />
&quot;if these Naaru are pure light and good, then there must be a polar opposite - that is, naaru who are as much darkness and evil as the ones we have encountered so far are good and pure.&quot;<br />
&quot;When a naaru dies, its energies become depleted and transforms into a void. The void is a space of pure shadow in which it consumes all spirits and souls around it and transforms them into voidwalkers as elemental off-products.&quot;<br />
Thus the Voids around Oshu'Gun.<br />

Dimensius anyone? Naaru.</div></div><hr />

You don't play Horde, I'm guessing. Horde find this out by doing the Greatmother's quest in Nagrand. All the souls of the Orc ansestors are being devoured by a void created by a dying Naaru in Oshu'gun. When you talk to him, you realize that the void is merely incidental, but an unavoidable result of a Naaru's death. The Legion, having discovered this, is trying to use it to their advantage - and it seems they're using M'uru's passivity to their advantage. (M'uru, as it turns out, is allowing the drain of his power in order to draw the Blood Elves to the light.) While this wasn't killing him it did weaken him enough that when Kael's forces attacked he was defenseless. Looking at what occurs during the Mu'ru fight, they have managed to get him to his last stages of life, where his void transformation is about to occur. I figure you kill M'uru thinking you're 'saving' him from slavery and he rezzes as Entropus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it doesn't read like that to me, dead n'aaru don't become voidwalkers, they create them. The entity Entropius is nothing really to do with m'uru, m'uru is just his spawn point. entropius is probably the soul of whatever the boss before m'uru is =D<br />

Of course that's some crazy speculation, but the similarities between the two monsters are really strange and it's not like Entropius could fit anywhere else in the Sunwell Plateau ... the next boss after M'uru being Kil'jaeden. Based on the information I've got I'd say that M'uru has been corrupted by Entropius, and you'll have to fight both of them in the Sunwell Plateau (with Entropius appearing in a later phase of the fight).&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
This is much easier to explain if you know the lore of the Naruu.<br />
<br />
When a Naru dies or suffers great amounts of shadow magic it goes into the second phase of its life. This usually means one of two things, the Naruu becomes dormant and slowly releases the shadow energy over time (usually resulting in creating a cursed grounds containing lots of void monstrocities, or in the much more rare case... they become utterly corrupted and go bezerk)<br />
<br />
Voidwalkers seem to be the corrupted versions of lesser naruu. Blizzard stated the burning legion fills its ranks by corrupting and twisting other races, and this seems like a logical outcome of what happens when a being of energy turns dark.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now for the information about the speculation, look at the caster voids found in Arc and Netherstorm. If you look at the gem like crest on their backs you will also notice the same 'naruu' pattern. It is very likely that Entropius is another phase of M'uru, but what is particularly interesting is that blizzard made a point of saying in their lore that a large amount of holy energy can also turn a dark naruu light again... just a thought (holy form a part of this fight possible? DPSing holy priests for the win!)</div></div><hr />

The void is a space of pure shadow in which it consumes all spirits and souls around it and transforms them into voidwalkers as elemental off-products. [citation needed] The great amount of void energies at Auchindoun are created by the corpse of the great naaru D'ore who was interred by the Draenei at Auchindoun. However, after a period of time, a naaru corpse can regenerate its lost energies of the light and return to full power. Thus, the naaru life cycle is one of light, darkness, and resurrection.</div></div><hr />

There are various colours of Naaru to represent the different points in their life cycles.<br />
<br />
Adal is white, it's at the highest good/light point a naaru can be at.<br />
Muru is black, it's at the lowest dead/shadow point a naaru can be at.<br />
All the other naaru ingame are of various inbetween colours such as purple.<br />
<br />
Muru cannot go into the &quot;dead/shadow&quot; phase in the middle of the fight, turning into a voidwalker. Muru is already in that phase, which is why it is hostile. If that voidwalker is supposed to be Muru, then it would be named Muru.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dead&quot; naaru do however attract/spawn Voidwalkers, see the one in nagrand which is surrounded by them. If for some reason that voidwalker IS Muru, it is nothing at all to do with the naaru life cycle as we have been told about so far. It'll be the result of something going horribly wrong.<br />
<br />
If you still think i'm wrong, go watch the end of the preview video where the voidwalker clearly spawns in the Muru battle, and is up at the same time as Muru. <br />
<br />

You mean those NORMAL armored void walkers in the 1 minute attempt they made on M'uru? We don't know what happens after that move that killed everyone yet nor if he transforms into the Void God model later in the fight. But when Naaru 'die' they turn into a void creature so more than likely he does turn into that Void God model which when defeated cleanses M'uru. Also your color theory is nothing more than speculation and is documented no where in official lore so while it makes sense its nothing but speculation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">leviathonlx</div><div class="date">2008-02-25, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No. Muru has changed from red/purple(silvermoon) to black(sunwell). No where does it say that they turn into a void creature when they die, it does say that they turn shadow and start sucking in souls. So Muru can't &quot;die&quot; because it's already happened. The Adal(White-Alive) / Muru(Black-Dead) is just too obvious to say its speculation, especially since Muru has changed colour.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it wont happen, but people are using misinterpreting current lore to say it's normal when it isn't.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your right Blizzard decided to give him a unique texture for Sunwell but no where has it been said yet what the colors mean and thats nothing but speculation. In the end EVERYTHING is speculation till we see the rest of the fight so the entire argument is pointless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So what is the rest of the fight like?<br />
<br />
So far i understand it to be...<br />
Phase one:<br />
-u tank the voids muru spawns,<br />
-dps split between void and muru (range on muru to stay out of the dark shadow aoe / melee on void (probably casts so rogues go kicky)<br />
-He seems to do a kind of electrical attack to random people, probably shadow damage (could this be another resist fight, void do melee shadow dmg so probably) might also be a spread out fight, cant quite see much more from the trailer.<br />
<br />
Phase two:<br />
Run in circles and spam /chicken?<br />
<br />
Hope any of this helps</div></div><hr />
