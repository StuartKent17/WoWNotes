Ready to make memories with your friends and share fantastic adventures with them across Azeroth and beyond? The new Recruit A Friend program is the perfect way to show them the ropes.<br />
<br />
What’s New?<br />
The new-and-improved Recruit A Friend (RAF) program retains fan-favorite features, and it introduces a bounty of new rewards—because Azeroth is best experienced with friends at your side. Just like the previous program, you can teleport to each other with Friend-to-Friend Summoning (which works on a 30 minute cooldown) and receive 50% bonus experience when partied together.<br />
<br />
More Recruits, More Rewards<br />
The new Recruit A Friend program allows you to be linked with up to 10 friends, and earns game time and other unique rewards—like mounts, pets, and more—the longer they play. Players new to WoW and veteran players who have not purchased game time on their account in the past two years can be enlisted in this program. Each time one of your recruits adds game time to their account, you’ll earn progress toward a new reward. The more friends you invite, the faster you’ll earn the rewards, as one friend adding multiple months of game time earns the same rewards as multiple friends adding one month of game time each. See all the rewards you can get below!*<br />
<br />

Rikki - 1 Month<br />
Game Time – 2 Months<br />
Explorer’s Dunetrekker – 3 Months<br />

<br />

<br />
Go it Together<br />
Time flies when you’re having fun, and it goes even faster when you and your recruits play together. Conquer Azeroth alongside your friends and you’ll both receive a 50% bonus to experience for faster leveling when partied together. You can also summon each other once every 30 minutes. Furthermore, our new Party Sync feature makes it easier than ever to level with friends. When activated, everyone in the party becomes aligned to the same quest state and phase. You’ll also have access to a “replay quest” feature that allows players who’ve already completed certain quests to replay them with their friends for rewards that are appropriate to their current level, regardless of the quest’s original level. Quests can be replayed for rewards once per day.<br />
<br />
If you’d prefer to play with your friend using a current character rather than starting a new one, you now can. By using Party Sync, you can choose to have your level adjusted so you can quest and experience outdoor content with your friends as they level up. And, If you want to queue for instanced content (such as Battlegrounds and dungeons) in their level range, you can choose to join them by having your level scaled down.<br />
<br />
Please note that unlike Timewalking, when your level is scaled, you will temporarily lose access to abilities and powers (such as Azerite Traits and over-level spells, abilities, talents, and trinket effects) with requirements that exceed your reduced level.<br />
<br />
Lead with Confidence<br />
To help you help your friends, we’ve created a brand-new RAF panel in-game to help you know when to expect your next reward and given your access to Party Sync. The RAF panel also lists special activities available to players who participate in the program. Complete these in-game challenges with your recruits to earn even more rewards.<br />
<br />
Start Your Journey<br />
The new Recruit A Friend lets you generate a custom link in-game that you can send to your friends. This link will help you and your recruit connect in-game, and you’ll be able to see if they’ve purchased game time, which will lead to rewards for you! For each month your recruits have active game time, you’ll earn a new reward, such as unique pets, mounts, game time, and more. These rewards unlock each month and scale with the amount of time your recruits have subscribed for. And, of course, with Party Sync, you’ll be able to journey with your friends on any of your characters.<br />

<br />
Adventure Awaits<br />
Recruit A Friend returns to World of Warcraft in the next few months. When you’re ready to bring your friends to Azeroth, simply log in to WoW and generate an invite link through the Recruit A Friend interface, then send that link to your friends. Up to four friends can use it to link their accounts to yours. To recruit more friends, you’ll need to generate a new link, which you can do once every 30 days.<br />
<br />
*In-game rewards are available to use in World of Warcraft, but not in World of Warcraft® Classic. Free game time earned through Recruit A Friend provides access to both World of Warcraft and WoW Classic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i dont think you know, but your friend even before needed to buy 2 months for you to get the mount.<br />
this is actually abit easier, as you can get 10 friends foro ne month, instead of having to get each freidn for 2.<br />

I'm 100% positive that this &quot;Renowned Explorer's Attire&quot; will be xmoggable over any armor type.<br />

There's your Cash Shop fully implemented now, except in the case of F2P MMOs, this is 100x more expensive. (15$x12 = $180). Whereas on the F2P the set would likely be $15 to $20.</div></div><hr />

or recruit 10 people 1 month each...<br />
the old system also required that the people be subbed for atleast 2 months ontop of the month they got for buying the game.<br />

1. the backpack is 10 months, not 12, the rest of the armor set is 12 months<br />
<br />
<br />
is it? idk about you but<br />
pet=5$<br />
gametime=15$<br />
mount=25$<br />
title=lets say i would pay 2$ for one<br />
game time=15$<br />
enchant= 5$ lets say<br />
tabard=5$<br />
Game time=15$<br />
mount=25$<br />
THE BACKPACK= 5$ like a tmog helmet from store before<br />
game time=15$<br />
full set= lets say 10$<br />
<br />
142$ value<br />
<br />
<br />
lets say you literally make another account just for these items you are paying 12 months (for the full set, you only need 10 months for the backpack, i guess both yall cant read)<br />
that is 180$ lets see what you get<br />
pet, 4 months of game time back (so really your only paying for 8 months of gametime) a title, 2 mounts, a full set including the special backpack, a weapon enchant, a tabard<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
but again you only need 10 months for the rucksack, and you get 3 months free, so really your only paying for 7 &quot;wasted&quot; months.</div></div><hr />

Lol.<br />
<br />
I mean you can stay under that desk and swallow what Activision gives you, but I sure won't.<br />
<br />
This isn't a &quot;142$&quot; value. The set ALONE is what everyone will want, so they can xmog it on any armor type. They put the set at the 12 month mark FOR A REASON.</div></div><hr />

1. i love how i provide facts and am met with &quot;lol gargle activisions cock more&quot;<br />
2. does &quot;everyone want that set&quot; it looks pretty average, i dont think im gunna see hundreds of people running around in it, its pretty average. the backpack yes, but thats only on 10 months, which is still late in, but again proves you dont know how to read that your saying it comes from 12 months<br />
3. again its only really 120 (i know &quot;only 120) cause you get 4 months of time for doing the whole thing.<br />
<br />

<br />
Can't just bring a friend and get your reward anymore like before, gotta keep them in for at least 4 investor reports this time around, oh but don't worry we'll obliterate the exp bonus too, need to keep those boosts selling.<br />
<br />
also i find it funny people praise classic for how leveling was an advneture, it took time and it took dedication.<br />
meanwhile &quot;LOL BLIZZARD NOT MAKING LEVELING ON RETAIL SUPER QUICK, WOW SHIT GAME&quot;<br />
RaF giving tons of exp just felt bad, cause it made it so that people felt forced to level with friends, and that they needed to force their friends to play so they could level much faster.</div></div><hr />

yes exactly that. any account that is new, or has not been subbed for 2 years. even if they sub for only 1 month, they will add to this pool.<br />
where before they NEEDED to be new, and needed to sub for 2 months.<br />

<br />
It's not a cash shop. This program is made for new or old people to jump back in the game. Not for you to get a second account and do it. <br />
<br />
You are not even paying the monthly fee, your friend is. It's not blizzard fault that YOU want to abuse the system and game it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah it was alot of money, it was like 20$ then 30$ for two months of sub time, then you needed to do that for every single pet and mount.<br />
now its just you need to have overall 12 months of subbed of people new OR OLD which is huge, as this is a combination of the recruit a friend and scrol of resotation.</div></div><hr />

I'm 100% positive that this &quot;Renowned Explorer's Attire&quot; will be xmoggable over any armor type.<br />
<br />
There's your Cash Shop fully implemented now, except in the case of F2P MMOs, this is 100x more expensive. (15$x12 = $180). Whereas on the F2P the set would likely be $15 to $20.<br />
<br />
Or and hear me out on this one, you could get some friends into the game or returning friends into the game and it cost you 0 whole dollars.</div></div><hr />

nah it costs money therefore cash shop.<br />
which is funny why they would even play wow, since its had a cash shop since the day vanilla launched.<br />
&quot;pay X extra money and get your choice of a lil'diablo, panda pet, zerglin pet, no one else can get it, only you because you paid us extra money&quot; hmmm sounds like a cash shop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey pay us 500$ to buy 500 of these little containers, you can open them, and 1 in a 800 chance you can get a mount that you get in wow! Lets say a &quot; hmmm sounds like a cash shop, and a bad one at that, that is right out loot boxes!<br />
&quot;Hey and lets say you buy enough of those containers, you can use points you get from each pack, to buy some ingame rewards!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
yeah, wow has had a cash shop in since day 1.<br />
just not in a menu it was the collectors edition, and it was the TCG &quot;Loot boxes&quot;</div></div><hr />

and so on so forth for... however many combinations there is, 12x12 alterations? so like a few hundred thousands i think.<br />

no you do not need to get ONE person to sub for 10 months, you need to get 10 months total of &quot;recruited months&quot;<br />

It was bad enough to wall off unique items for the old RAF, but at least if you really wanted the reward you could feasibly fork out the money to recruit your own second account. In this new system nobody in their right mind is going to pay to recruit themselves. And that's what this really is meant for - to land whales who are happy to effectively double their subscription payments for a year in exchange for unique collectibles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;the old system had nothing wrong with it&quot; you mean where the old system you had to do 3 months per account per reward, and if the player only did 2 months then quit you were fucked because that whole thing was a waste.<br />
<br />
<br />
with the old system lets say you wanted 9 months worth of rewards &quot;3 accounts&quot;<br />
<br />
1: 2 months- fuck<br />
2: 3 months then keeps playing for another 28 months, but only the 3 first months count, fuck<br />
3: 1 month- fuck<br />
4: 3 months- ok you have got 2 so far.<br />
5: 1 month- fuck<br />
6: 4 months- again overkill you only needed 3, there you go you have your 3 rewards.<br />
<br />
<br />
now lets say we want all the MANY rewards in this system, we will go with the EXACT same as the top<br />
<br />
1: 2 months, 10 more to go<br />
2: 31 months, you are well over done. no need to recruit any more, but lets go 3 at a time cause of course you dont wanna wait super long<br />
3: 1 month- 6 so far now<br />
4: 3 months- 9 so far now<br />
5: 1 month- 2 more to go<br />
6: 4 months- 2 over, you have all the rewards, would you look at that, of course in my simulation there is no reality. but it shows the benefits of each.<br />
<br />
while yes the top requires less per reward, those people MUST hit 3, any less and it was a waste. and anything ABOVE three is a waste. meaning for 3 rewards you need ATLEAST 3 people to do 3 months.<br />
<br />
<br />
for the bottom, while yes you need more, ANY time from ANY friends counts, meaning you can recruit ONE friend and get all the rewards. where before even if you recruited a friedn and he played till the end of time, you got only 1 reward no matter what.<br />
here recruiting 1 friend is enough to get all the rewards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
oh also for the same amount of months you get FAR more rewards then the old system.<br />

i know its not a cash shop, but i was using it as an example, and how he keeps calling is cash shop, so if that is a cash shop, so is the vanilla collectors edition, and the TCG and UDE system. so if this recruit a friend system is &quot;cash shop&quot; so are those, and those have been around since vanilla.</div></div><hr />

<br />
with the old system, I don't think you got anything for one month. you got a free month if they subbed for 2 months. Then you got a mount or pet of your choice at three months. Then that was it. Most of the rewards in this new system are fucking worthless.</div></div><hr />

No.<br />

By making a second account you are gaming the system.<br />

You have to wait TEN MONTHS instead of TWELVE, wow, what's 60 days when you've already waited THREE HUNDRED. l m f a o<br />
<br />
&quot;People have been asking for backpacks/rucksacks for a LONG time too, so nice of Activison to offer it for $180 ^-^&quot;<br />
again you literally said &quot;people have been asking for a backpack for a long time, nice of them to sell it for 180&quot;<br />
again, you are the one who said this not me.<br />
also nah, i have a ton of friends who havnt played wow i might be able to recruit in, so i can easly get it in 1 month by getting 10 of them to each try wow for 1 month.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheRevenantHero</div><div class="date">2019-09-10, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;the old system had nothing wrong with it&quot; you mean where the old system you had to do 3 months per account per reward, and if the player only did 2 months then quit you were fucked because that whole thing was a waste.<br />
<br />
<br />
with the old system lets say you wanted 9 months worth of rewards &quot;3 accounts&quot;<br />
<br />
1: 2 months- fuck<br />
2: 3 months then keeps playing for another 28 months, but only the 3 first months count, fuck<br />
3: 1 month- fuck<br />
4: 3 months- ok you have got 2 so far.<br />
5: 1 month- fuck<br />
6: 4 months- again overkill you only needed 3, there you go you have your 3 rewards.<br />
<br />
<br />
now lets say we want all the MANY rewards in this system, we will go with the EXACT same as the top<br />
<br />
1: 2 months, 10 more to go<br />
2: 31 months, you are well over done. no need to recruit any more, but lets go 3 at a time cause of course you dont wanna wait super long<br />
3: 1 month- 6 so far now<br />
4: 3 months- 9 so far now<br />
5: 1 month- 2 more to go<br />
6: 4 months- 2 over, you have all the rewards, would you look at that, of course in my simulation there is no reality. but it shows the benefits of each.<br />
<br />
while yes the top requires less per reward, those people MUST hit 3, any less and it was a waste. and anything ABOVE three is a waste. meaning for 3 rewards you need ATLEAST 3 people to do 3 months.<br />
<br />
<br />
for the bottom, while yes you need more, ANY time from ANY friends counts, meaning you can recruit ONE friend and get all the rewards. where before even if you recruited a friedn and he played till the end of time, you got only 1 reward no matter what.<br />
here recruiting 1 friend is enough to get all the rewards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
oh also for the same amount of months you get FAR more rewards then the old system.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i know its not a cash shop, but i was using it as an example, and how he keeps calling is cash shop, so if that is a cash shop, so is the vanilla collectors edition, and the TCG and UDE system. so if this recruit a friend system is &quot;cash shop&quot; so are those, and those have been around since vanilla.<br />
<br />
Like I responded to someone else, after 2 months you got a free month of game time. After 3 months you got a mount or pet of YOUR CHOICE. RAF other benefits lasted for like 6 months where you each got 300% more experience and the recruited person could grant a level to the veteran for every two levels they gained. This new system is fucking trash and was only implemented for Blizzard to drum up subscriptions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
uhh what?<br />
1. the old system had the choice of a mount, or a pet<br />
2. yes you literally got NOTHING for the first month<br />
3. how is &quot;LITERALLY NOTHING&quot; better then ANYTHING in this system?<br />
4. &quot;the old one gave a mount or pet of your choice, and game time&quot; you mean what this one gives...<br />
12 months=<br />
4 months of game time<br />
1 pet<br />
1 title<br />
1 weapon enchant<br />
1 armor set<br />
2 mounts<br />
1 backpack <br />
1 tabard.<br />
<br />
<br />
lets go off what you would get from 12 months in the old system<br />
<br />
4 months<br />
4 mounts<br />
or <br />
4 months<br />
4 pets<br />
<br />
so yes, at the cost of 2 mounts you get 1 pet, 1 title, 1 wep enchant, 1 armor set, 1 tabard, 1 backpack.<br />
oh and the flexability that these can all be earned on ONE ACCOUNT.<br />
<br />
<br />
so again how is the old system &quot;more rewarding&quot; especially sincei n the old one if your friend subbed for only 2 months or 1 month, you did not get time, or a mount, however with this system even if they sub for ONLY 1 MONTH you STILL get rewarded.</div></div><hr />

Nor can anyone reasonably guarantee that the recruit they're depending on to keep playing for a year will even do so.<br />
<br />
It was bad enough to wall off unique items for the old RAF, but at least if you really wanted the reward you could feasibly fork out the money to recruit your own second account. In this new system nobody in their right mind is going to pay to recruit themselves. And that's what this really is meant for - to land whales who are happy to effectively double their subscription payments for a year in exchange for unique collectibles.<br />
<br />
If the target was just whales they would have been better off keeping the old system where you had to sub for multiple months for a single reward.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately WoW's main goal now is nothing more than to impress shareholders. That's why flying was locked for 1 year, Allied Races locked for 10 months, RNG loot chest for M+ containing the same reward for weeks in a row, M+ having 100% more trash than Legion M+. It's sad</div></div><hr />

What in the actual fuck is wrong with you? o_o... lmfao<br />
<br />
Going to a website that has absolutely NO AFFILIATION with Activision/Blizzard and BUYING a &quot;code&quot; from someone to claim a pet is not a fucking cash shop. How can you not see this?<br />
<br />
Being in game, connected to Activision/Blizzard servers, opening up the thing named &quot;SHOP&quot; and purchasing a $10 pet IS A CASH SHOP.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Netherspark</div><div class="date">2019-09-10, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing to consider is that to be eligible for the rewards both you and your recruit need to have active subscriptions through a whole year, a year that from this point will include the end of expansion lull. A time when scores of players take a few months away from the game and their subscriptions as they wait for the next expansion, but you and your recruit may end up paying through this period even if you're not playing, just to ensure you get your rewards. This feels above all else like another cheap tactic to keep people subscribed through the lull.<br />
<br />
For many new players this lull often leads to them loosing interest and not returning at all. <br />
<br />
This is just reiterating the fact that the chances of you successfuly recruiting someone who actually plays for the full 12 months is honestly very low. It would not surprise me if half of the recruiters never even reach their full rewards.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Paying real life money to get items you cannot get ingame through play is fine. but paying real life money to get items you cannot get ingame through play is bad.&quot;<br />

the title, tabard, weapon enchant, and backpack transmog are garbage and the in game experience reward is also absolute garbage. But...whatever dude. There really is no arguing with Blizzard diehards....<br />
<br />
sooo the mounts from RAF 1.0 were trash too, one of them was literally just a fucking horse with a horn.<br />
<br />
also you havnt even fuckign seen the weapon enchant, we cant even see it yet, i love how you have proven your bias by saying <br />

&quot;X is shit!&quot;<br />

A time when scores of players take a few months away from the game and their subscriptions as they wait for the next expansion, but you and your recruit may end up paying through this period even if you're not playing, just to ensure you get your rewards. This feels above all else like another cheap tactic to keep people subscribed through the lull.<br />
<br />
For many new players this lull often leads to them loosing interest and not returning at all. <br />
<br />
This is just reiterating the fact that the chances of you successfuly recruiting someone who actually plays for the full 12 months is honestly very low. It would not surprise me if half of the recruiters never even reach their full rewards.<br />

Or you know you could recruit more then one person or get old friends back into the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no only your friend needs to have a year.<br />
or you can have 12 friends who are subbed for 1 month each<br />
<br />
and again this is not all at once, you could have 3 people come try classic for one month each.<br />
then next year when 9.0 comes out those people return for another 3 months each. then boom you have your 12 months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Each time one of your recruits adds game time to their account, you’ll earn progress toward a new reward.<br />
No one has to be subbed for 12 consecutive months. It adds up every time one of your recruits adds game time. I do expect the recruiter has to have an active account at the time the recruit pays for his or it won't add up, but that's it. You can all take a break for 6 months and return later to work to the 12 month reward. You can also have 2 recruits each pay for 6 months, or 3 that pay for 4 months and as much breaks as they want.</div></div><hr />

The first RAF mount, the Zhevra, was absolute trash. I'll agree there. Every other mount is fucking amazing, though. Hell, two of the mounts are actually two person mounts. And I don't need to see the weapon enchantment. There hasn't been a single weapon enchant appearance in game that impressed me at all so I don't see how the new RAF one will be any better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Going to a website that has absolutely NO AFFILIATION with Activision/Blizzard and BUYING a &quot;code&quot; from someone to claim a pet is not a fucking cash shop. How can you not see this?<br />
<br />
Being in game, connected to Activision/Blizzard servers, opening up the thing named &quot;SHOP&quot; and purchasing a $10 pet IS A CASH SHOP.<br />
<br />
except the vanilla colectors edition was made by blizzard... and was bought... paying blizzard.<br />
<br />
<br />
so are you saying its fine if its years later?<br />
idk if you know, but blizz made those collectors editions, it was not just made by players.<br />
<br />
<br />
you are paying someone real life money, who paid blizzard real life money, for something ingame.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
again, you lil laqweeta are sitting at your computer in 2004 you buy this game called wow, and log in, you see a person with zerglin pet, you ask &quot;hey how do i get that&quot; you are then told &quot;pay blizzartd 120$ for their collectors edition, then you can have it&quot;<br />
<br />
but nah thats fine to you, because fuck logic.</div></div><hr />

Yes yes business can do whatever they like. People are just meat suits to be sold things. There's nothing like ethics and government oversight to stop predatory behaviour.

you know what promotes gambling? lootboxes<br />
you know what lootboxes are like? Card booster packs<br />
You know what game had card booster packs that cost real money with possible ingame rewards? vanilla wow.<br />

yeah surpise people, the game has always been a cash grab, welcome to gaming, where guess what, games cost money, and companies want your money.<br />

i mean your the one defending a predatory system that cost people 50$ per reward, and required bothering all of your friends to try and get them to pay the company.<br />

One version has a cash shop, where you're inside of the actual game, click the &quot;shop&quot; icon, and buy items through it.<br />
The other version has no cash shop, there's no possible way for you to buy anything in-game with money other than a sub.<br />

If we use your version, every single game has a cash shop because you can go onto mmoitems.com and buy items lol.</div></div><hr />

lets compare.<br />

<br />
Pets, mounts, and toys you can only obtain by paying blizzard real life money= not cash shop.<br />
recruiting friends to play wow, and for doing so you are rewarded for every month one of your friends is subbed= cash shop.<br />

no, they charged i think it was 150$<br />
but nah thats fine, cause it was vanilla, and vanilla was perfect.<br />
oh justn oticed, you admitted they had a cash shop.<br />
&quot;SHow me where they sold a CE version of the base game, and i will admit it had a cash shop&quot;<br />
well they did, so mate, sorry to tell you, but in vanilla, you could pay an extra 100$ and get ingame items that other people could not, and you agree!</div></div><hr />

if you wanted those pets you could not earn them ingame<br />
you NEEDED to pay REAL LIFE MONEY if you wanted those INGAME ITEMS.<br />
<br />
cash shop.<br />
<br />
<br />
well sure it meets the technical definition. but the intend is completely different which is what makes it a false equivalency if you ask me. <br />
<br />
cash shop to me implies more than just having to pay real money, it also comes with inherent negative/greedy connotations. and i don't believe for one second the original vanillla/TBC/WoTLK collectors editions were made with greed or milking the customer in mind. <br />
<br />
i also feel like for something to be a shop, you actually have to be able to buy things at it. and those early CEs were some very damn limited runs man.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laqweeta</div><div class="date">2019-09-10, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how stupid i sound?<br />
<br />
lets compare.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pets, mounts, and toys you can only obtain by paying blizzard real life money= not cash shop.<br />
recruiting friends to play wow, and for doing so you are rewarded for every month one of your friends is subbed= cash shop.<br />
that is what you are saying.<br />
ok man.<br />
<br />
<br />
no, they charged i think it was 150$<br />
but nah thats fine, cause it was vanilla, and vanilla was perfect.<br />
oh justn oticed, you admitted they had a cash shop.<br />
&quot;SHow me where they sold a CE version of the base game, and i will admit it had a cash shop&quot;<br />
well they did, so mate, sorry to tell you, but in vanilla, you could pay an extra 100$ and get ingame items that other people could not, and you agree!<br />
<br />
Being able to afford $100 to get a pet and being too poor to purchase a CE version of the game to get a pet does not define the term cash shop.<br />
<br />
Being able to buy a token for $20 that you sell on the AH for 175k gold and buy ilvl 930 HC gear defines the term cash shop.</div></div><hr />

1. again you forget the TCG, which you had to buy hundreds of card packs to get the mounts, are you saying lootboxes are not greedy? I guess you must be an EA fan<br />
2. how do you know blizzard didn go &quot;hey you know what, lets add pets to it, so if players want those petsi ngame, they have to buy it!&quot; almost like the current cash shop...<br />
<br />
how can you say &quot;Blizzard making us pay real life money for ingame items is fine cause it was vanilla, but now that its BFA that is not ok&quot;</div></div><hr />

People are just meat suits to be sold things. There's nothing like ethics and government oversight to stop predatory behaviour. Who cares if they are ripping people off and are promoting gambling in youth. They have to pay their power bill. Please. Open your eyes for once<br />
<br />
How is ethics even being brought into this. Nothing being sold is power gaining, so there is no reason for people to obsessively buy it. Stop trying to make something where there isn't. This is literally a conversation about vanity items and you are saying this is promoting gambling or ripping people off? Get off your high horse, nothing being sold in the shop or as part of this RAF is essential for play.</div></div><hr />

lololol<br />
so you agree this is not a cash shop thing. as its only 180$ for everything only 120$ if you dont include the free months. and only poor people would complain about that, as you just said!<br />
see, you changed your mind, this is not a cash shop thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
paying 120$ for a total of 8 rewards is cash shop<br />
but paying 150$ for 1 of 3 pets is not.<br />
i gotcha man.</div></div><hr />

i said how one was fine and the other isnt: the obviousness/excessiveness of the greed vs fanservice. <br />
<br />
TCG is just a weird thing man, technically it's not a cash shop but merely cross promotion. in reality sure it's a straight up cash shop now that the actual TCG is pretty much dead. but cause its a TCG its also kinda inherent that it works that way. card games are fucking weird with their monitization man.</div></div><hr />

except it was cahs shop<br />
1. you are paying blizzard directly, as they make money off EVERY SINGLE PACK SOLD<br />
2. also omfg the tcg is dead? guess what that has no effect on. this. thats funny, so blizzard used to sell loot boxes for wow back in vanilla, but removed it later, i think with cataclysm?<br />
3. so agian your saying lootboxes are fine, but recruit a friend is not?<br />
<br />
card games arte literally lootboxes, but they were usually fine as they could be traded, and only effected the card game, the thing becomes loot boxes when those card suddenly have a chance to have a reward for an entirely different game.</div></div><hr />

There's your Cash Shop fully implemented now, except in the case of F2P MMOs, this is 100x more expensive. (15$x12 = $180). Whereas on the F2P the set would likely be $15 to $20.<br />

also yeah, laying off staff you dont need.<br />

With the old system you couldn’t just say try and game and unsub if you don’t like it as you had to sub for three months to get the reward. This new system also isn’t limited to one friend and you can get theses for returning friends as well. <br />

This RAF new system is a pyramid scheme. It is not supposed to bring people to the world its supposed to bring people and pressure them to keep playing for you to earn stuff. This bar literally fills up as blizzard gets money. And it fills up faster the more people you have recruited. By using you to advertise a product you have no control over. And that wont give you any share of revenew other that cosmetic stuff that you need to have an active account to earn.

This is the Pyramid Scheme of Azeroth. It is not made to bring new people back to the world. Its made to bring new people and then pressure them to keep their account active so that you can win rewards. This is a bar that literally fills up as Blizzard earns money. By using you to advertise a product you have no control over, wont be considered in the revenew and you will only get a cosmetic reward that you need to keep and account active to use. <br />

It's just kinda sad that Blizzard is adding awesome things after they pay-wall. Inb4 &quot;omg, but you still pay subscription&quot;, yeah I do. Though I think it should've been like gym. Just because you pay subsription, it doesn't mean you deserve to be fit/ripped/whatever it's called nowadays wihtout any effort. You have to work for it.<br />

<br />
The old raf was bad. I can tell you about it because i just got 3 rewards from 10 friends that i RaF on pandaria and just 1 on Legion when someone returned and paid its third month. <br />
<br />
Now i can send scrolls to all the people that used to play wow with me on pandaria and even if they get 1 month, it still counts. What i want to know its about the &quot;activities with your friend&quot;, like what? finishing maraudon with your RaF?? killing a rare in a dungeon while leveling?? those are the things that i want to know.<br />
<br />
And guess what? you still earn if your friend just go to play Classic. Because you know..... you paid a monthly sub for BfA and Classic.</div></div><hr />

This isn't a &quot;142$&quot; value. The set ALONE is what everyone will want, so they can xmog it on any armor type. They put the set at the 12 month mark FOR A REASON.<br />
<br />
I'm not arguing for or against store stuff, but how is this any different than what the store has already had in it?<br />
<br />
Mounts? Check<br />
Pets? Check<br />
Cosmetic mog stuff? Check<br />
<br />
I mean, God forbid anyone actually use this the way it could be, and get someone playing the game, and get all this stuff for free in the process. Once again I'm not promoting real money transactions, just not exactly sure where this newfound outrage is coming from.</div></div><hr />

it's not a paywall, it's a reward for a system implemented to draw people into the game. those aren't cashshop items. stop treating it as they put a pricetag on those items, just because you can technically spend 150$ to get them doesn't mean it is intended to be abused in this way. also, who said they won't be adding new unique backslots in next patch ? we are still waiting for ptr of it</div></div><hr />

Son confusing. So if I recruit a friend, I should no longer say &quot;try this game for a month, if you do I get something in-game. If you don't like it, you can always unsub.&quot; Now I have to say &quot;try this game, but you have to stay subbed for like an year for me to get anything good.&quot; Oof, no pressure, right?

I have 4 accounts tied to my Battle.net my main one my mums main one and two RAF ones, considering they are on my Battle.net is that even possible? I mean I've RAF'd them before so it would seem so, but where money is involved I like to be 100% sure. <br />

That's because all Acti-Blizz cares for is player engagement - that means how often he logs in, how much time he spends in the game and how much money he wastes. The point is to make people log in, run on a treadmill without achieving anything and come back the next day - the mobile gaming mentality. Nobody cares about fun, sense of fulfilment, challenge, satisfaction. MAUs are all that matter to shareholders and that's what the aim is for the company.<br />
That's why the game doesn't have soul anymore. It's being made by suits instead of gamers (as Acti-Blizz admitted on several occasions many of their devs just play mobile shit now).</div></div><hr />

Just going by what the blue post states, and it has “new accounts and accounts that haven’t had a paid sub in 2 years.”<br />
Not saying whether I agree with it or not. I stopped playing this year and I understand why Blizz does things a certain way and never have I seen anything that I personally think is despicable, but that’s my opinion. This is a neat idea how it’s set up, but I also understand why some people are upset about it.</div></div><hr />

This system seems way better. Since instead of just getting 1 reward you are consistently rewarded for just playing. It's finally on Par with far better RAF systems from other games like FFXIV and SWTOR where you keep getting bonuses simply by having friends play as well.<br />

You could get some friends? Though your attitude makes me think that is a lot of the reason you likely don't.</div></div><hr />

Since instead of just getting 1 reward you are consistently rewarded for just playing. It's finally on Par with far better RAF systems from other games like FFXIV and SWTOR where you keep getting bonuses simply by having friends play as well.<br />

First off, from your signature &quot;RIP BFA 8/27&quot; it sounds like you're a retail hater - which is fine - but why are you arguing about recruit a friend when none of these perks work in classic to begin with?<br />
<br />
If your friends are playing private servers, go for it, why even play classic? You get to play Vanilla wow without layering like a real men on them private servers</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sluvs</div><div class="date">2019-09-11, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Timing was actually carefully planned to make sure that rewards wouldn't be claimed through new subs for classic or subs that would be returning for classic anyway, dooh.<br />
<br />
To me, it looks like it was sloppily delayed. RaF would be a great incentive to keep your friends subbed and would probably offer more monetary gain for Blizz if it was released with classic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Worked that way with the old plan so I'd assume it will with this as well.</div></div><hr />

They’re about 15 or so years late to F them selfs as RAF has been around for a long long time.<br />

<br />
If they release it now rather than in relation to Classic, there's a reason. And RAF systems are decade old, this at least makes it better than it used to be. <br />
As for all those ragers out there: You can RAF yourself. I got a feeling that's some people's only option. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, we didn't. This won't bring us back either, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
should have been - but activision strikes again <br />
<br />
why put stuff in game when you can put it in game shop . <br />
<br />
its an ultimate dick move because they know pefeckly well that 99% wont bring in anyone to game but will ust pay 120 euro at once.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tokurei</div><div class="date">2019-09-12, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is actually insane... You can really feel the &quot;okay make sure we have enough rewards to cater to ALL the collectionists out there&quot; in this reward list. I used RaF in its early form to try to get friends and new people playing. All of them quit pretty early on, and that's when the game still felt fun. Now it really seems like Actiblizzard is BEGGING veteran players who still log on retail to bring in new subs, and if it's not to keep a single other person interested in the game for 12mo, it's some kind of weird pyramid scheme to recruit 12 different people for 1mo each... Like what...</div></div><hr />
