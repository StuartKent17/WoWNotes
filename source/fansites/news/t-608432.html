The bestiary page for World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King has been updated with a new creature and several new screenshots from the upcoming expansion. Learn more about one of the new species you'll encounter in Northrend, the redoubtable magnataur. <br />
Magnataur have the torso of a giant attached to the body of a mammoth. This peculiar appearance has sparked speculation that their race might be related to centaur or even keepers of the grove. Many wonder if these races share a common ancestor, and some have even suggested Cenarius himself.<br />
<br />
The notoriously long-lived magnataur are rumored to engage in cannibalism during times when food is scarce. Single males are known to control giant herds and produce sizable litters, but in the frigid, perilous wastes at the roof of the world, only the strongest and meanest survive.<br />
<br />
Despite their hostility to most races, the magnataur have become tolerant of the arctic kobolds, who follow the herds for safety and mutual benefit during long hunts. Although the redoubtable magnataur lead solitary lives, adventurers who cross paths with them quickly learn that it would have been wiser to stay at a safe distance. <br />

Arena Tournament Second Qualifier Begins <br />
Phase 1 of the 2008 World of Warcraft Arena Tournament's second qualification round has begun. Tournament participants have two weeks to hone their strategies, experiment with various team compositions, and practice their teamwork. To track the progress of your team and those of your competition, please visit the World of Warcraft Armory (http://www.wowarmory.com/) and select the Coliseum 1 battlegroup. For more information on the tournament, please visit our Arena Tournament information page (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/tournament/index.xml). Good luck, and may the best teams be left standing! <br />
And since we're talking about arenas, note that Vhairi's Scratchpad (http://vhairi.blogspot.com/) has been updated with new stats from the US Arena servers. The biggest changes are probably the rogues who are becoming slightly more popular, and the warlocks who keep falling down. <br />

US Website Downtime<br />
We will be performing maintenance on the World of Warcraft website and all related web features beginning tonight at 12:01 a.m. PDT, and ending at approximately 5:00 a.m. PDT. This downtime will include all web-based features such as the Armory, account management, and forums. Thank you for your patience and understanding during this maintenance. (Source (http://))<br />

Death Knight starting zone<br />
You'll be eased into playing the class much like you are now when creating a new level one character. The Death Knight starting area will ease players into understanding their class abilities and talents, as well as Death Knight specific mechanics.

Rendering of water in WoW<br />
The water is only transparent when the land beneath it is within a certain distance from the surface. So, normally the edges of a body of water will be transparent while the middle will not. Unless it's been specifically specified to be otherwise. So yeah, you're seeing it as it should be.

<br />
No. Look at that &quot;beast.&quot; Nearly every aspect is the same except for the skin. Compare the human model to the orc. It's taller, it's arms, legs, hands, face, shoulders, stomach, back, etc are all shaped differently. The animations are also completely different. Just looking at that screenshot doesn't inspire much faith in it being different beyond the skin. So sad...</div></div><hr />

Also Animations will likely be the same, which doesn't surprise me at all, I think the Pitlord/Magnataur Animations were the same in WC3 too.<br />
<br />
Maybe there's a connection there? Who knows.<br />
Or just Happenstance.. doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Still, a HUGE Beasty, Pitlords still amaze me in their size, They look so small from far away, as NPC's, but when you go to their Skeletons in Org and HFP or do Maggy a couple times.. it's just kind of daunting.. same thing with Gruul.. Everytime I watch a Vid of him, it amazes me because I don't remember him being that big the many times I've killed him (Under 16 grows)</div></div><hr />

The concept is way more original.<br />
<br />
On topic of water surface rendering - that's the one thing I was hoping to see changed. Ground surfaces in WoW look pretty nice, especially the parts that have a shader for lighting up parts when you look in the direction of the sun. Water surfaces are dull in comparison. :(</div></div><hr />

I think they look quite different. The pitlords has this maggot-with-legs appearance while the magnatur bears resemblance to the centaur. Especially the torso/belly/legs look totally different.<br />
They should change the tusks to look more like those in the concept though.</div></div><hr />

Maybe I am reading these graphs wrong, the legend is hard to read, but warlocks are not bottom of the barrel in ANY bracket according to this.<br />
<br />
Last time I checked SK100 there was a warlock in the top 10, and they were 12% of the top 100, about exactly what you'd expect with 9 classes (100% / 9 = 11.11%).</div></div><hr />

Paladin is lowest in 3s.<br />
Rogue is lowest in 5s.<br />

i totally agree with that. it´s nice to see someone who´s having his own style no matter what he is drawing. i like the look of the pet and how the character position perfectly fits in the whole concept. <br />

<br />
My apologies, I was reading the charts wrong. I thought the pairs of charts were &quot;before/after&quot; pairs, whereas they're actually &quot;current level/change&quot; pairs. Locks are at the bottom of all the change charts, meaning they've fallen behind more than any other class in any bracket in any rating.<br />
<br />
As for the current levels, quoting from Vhairi's site:<br />
<br />
warlocks who continue to fall, actually below the target levels in 3v3 and 5v5, and just inside the target zone in 2v2.<br />
So yeah, underrepresented in 3s and 5s and barely average in 2s. However I doubt this is the end of the story, since locks have been rerolling in droves since the nerfs (I've since rerolled rogue myself) and will probably continue to, even if there are no more nerfs on the horizon.</div></div><hr />
