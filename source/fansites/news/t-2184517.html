We had one last year and the year before. Only years we never had any were 2006 and 2012.</div></div><hr />

we will probably have one each year, since blizzard has many games, and lots of stuff to cover</div></div><hr />

Seriously if you don't think it's getting announced at Blizzcon you've not been paying attention.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not getting my hopes up for Diablo content after last Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
We will absolutely get an expansion announcement. Tomb of Sargeras will be finished and way under way and our journey to Argus will probably be under way and the 7.3 raid probably right after Blizzcon which leaves either 7.4 or a new expansion to talk about at Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

Well considering their current content pacing with Legion I wouldn't be surprised.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, in 2012 they already announced/just released something for all of their games. It wouldn't have been a fun Blizzcon with nothing to talk about. Since then they've expanded from 3 games to 6 games, so I doubt they'll be taking a break again.<br />

<br />
While World of Warcraft is alive and RTS being a completely dead genre they'res no chance of WC4.</div></div><hr />

There is high stake e-sports going on in blizzcon regardless of game announcements</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hope they actually do the OW cup right this year and not have it as a popularity contest.... last year could have been so much better but... poor australia...<br />
<br />
needs to be like every other e-sport stage and have events leading up to it.</div></div><hr />

By November, 7.3 / Argus will at the very least be on the PTR, going at the current pace. Maybe 7.3 will be a &quot;and guess what, it goes live RIGHT AFTER BlIZCON&quot; *Mic Drop* moment. If, like the Blizzcon before last, they are just covering specifics of 7.3 itself, then it means we are in for a 7-8 month content drought during 7.2 as that's likely no more than a month away. It's got to be an expansion announcement planned IMO.</div></div><hr />
