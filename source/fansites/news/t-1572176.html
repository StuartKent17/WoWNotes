Premade Groups: Looking for Adventure<br />

In a raid and need more adventurers to round out the group for a Normal or Heroic raid or need help finding like-minded players for a group quest? The Premade Group option within the Group Finder can help.<br />

<br />
Looking For Adventure<br />
To start browsing for groups that are looking for more you'll want to open Group Finder (Bound to the I key by default) then click on the Premade Groups option for PvE content such as questing, dungeons, and raids.<br />
<br />
Within the Player vs. Player tab, you can create premade groups for Arenas (2v2, 3v3, 5v5), Arena Skirmishes (2v2), Battlegrounds, and Rated Battlegrounds. You can also access the Player vs. Player pane directly (Bound to the H by default). Additionally, there’s a custom option to allow you to create groups for things not on the list, such as forming a raiding party to do a little world PvP in a capital city with a few new friends.<br />
<br />
Once you’ve identified a group that looks promising you can sign up to join it; the group leader will be notified that your pending join request needs their approval.<br />
<br />
<br />
Recruiting For Danger<br />
Those who want to take matters into their own hands can form groups by selecting ‘Start a Group’. Here’s a breakdown for what the different fields are for.<br />
<br />
Name: Give the group a name. It helps if the group name is something descriptive like “UBRS run”.<br />
<br />
Type: What is the purpose of the group? Questing? Running a Dungeon? Running a Normal raid, etc.?<br />
<br />
Requirements (optional): You can elect to use it to specify additional requirements, such as a minimum item level or use of voice chat to facilitate communications.<br />
<br />
Minimum Item Level (optional): It’s important to note that the minimum item level requirement must be less than or equal to your own item level.<br />
Voice Chat: Some groups may prefer members joining Voice Chat in game for greater coordination.<br />
Description (optional): A place available for those that want to provide more information, such as loot rules, or other information pertinent to the group.<br />
<br />
<br />
When your settings are ready, simply click ‘List Group’ to be listed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Holding Out For A Hero<br />
<br />
Players applying to join the group show up as potential applicants where the group leader can accept or decline. For raid groups, both the raid leader and players identified as raid assistants share the ability to accept or decline applicants. Additionally, raid groups will be able to see what ranks the applicants have attained in Proving Grounds (Bronze, Silver, or Gold). Meanwhile, a tally of the different roles in the group so far is reflected to provide an overview of how the group formation process is progressing.<br />
<br />
These changes and more await, making it easier to find like-minded players. Good luck, and happy grouping!</div></div><hr />

So far all the 'group' quests that I've done have been pretty easy to solo...but I haven't completed every zone. So I guess TBD?</div></div><hr />

I would be on the exact opposite side in opinion. Often times ilvl simply isn't enough to gauge if someone knows what they are doing on their character, and proving ground is a great step in the right direction. I'm very happy about this, and hope they elaborate more things around and upon said feature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one's shoving anything. You can choose not to do them at all, and I'm sure there will be group leaders out there who agree with you and won't take it into account. <br />
<br />
I for one would use it for raids only. It's an indication of someone's knowledge of their class and the time they choose to devote to proving themselves to others, rather than just getting carried to a certain ilvl or achievement. If someone chooses not to participate in Proving Grounds, that's their prerogative, I personally would probably be less likely to choose them for the group though.</div></div><hr />

This is a joke right? Proving grounds are complete crap. They are so unbalanced at the gold level its absurd. They are once again, trying to force us into features. <br />
<br />
I mean, its like they are stupid or something. No one likes the feature or uses it? Better find every way possible to force them into it.<br />
<br />
I do not see anyone, including myself, even glancing at the proving grounds section. It does not now, nor ever will it, mean a darn thing. I am glad that in order to use it, the minimum ilevel must be equal or less then yours. To a degree. It wont stop the idiots spewing in trade that you must have the same ilevel as all the gear in that wing in order to carry them in it. It wont much less stop he idiots with higher ilevels also wanting high ilevels for no reason but to go fast.<br />
<br />
I will wait to decide how good or bad it is until it is in game. It doesn't say if you can put in an optional message or not. It also doesn't say you have to actually stick to the ilevel requirement. So if they can put in an optional message, we will still have the idiots with the stupid ilevel requirements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. There are at least 1-2 group quests per zone. They require 3 people but SoO geared players, or tank specs can solo them. In 500 gear most specs would need 2 people, and if you are bad you will need 3. I think theres a 5 one in Nagrand?</div></div><hr />

What they should be doing is putting an armory link or mini armory browser page so you can do a proper check on the person. At the very least they should make ilvl take into account enchants, stat distributions, etc.</div></div><hr />

Weellll Gold for Heroic definitely. If I was putting together a Normal raid, I'd be fine with a Silver joining, depending on the difficulty of the bosses. SoO Flex 1-3 now, I think Silver would be fine. Probably Gold for a Garrosh run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are supposedly re-balancing/reworking it for WoD so its more meaningful. A good way to do that, would be to give everyone a high item level and raid buffs inside of it. <br />
<br />
Set the item level to like 690 so everyone has good stats, and give them raid buffs.<br />

In 500 starter gear, I will imagine average players will solo them all in any dps spec (asuming they actually hit their cds + zone ability).<br />
Befroure eu got char copy I went through a fury war (back when they sucked balls), destro lock, shadow priest, assa rogue, frost dk, enh/ele shammy, fire mage and ret paladin. None of these classes had any issues soloing group quests. Some needed the zone ability more than others, but with the zone ability all was cake.</div></div><hr />

ಠ_ಠ No. I've used it in the past. Ever used an online service for a video game console? My experience was like that - full of &quot;n word&quot; and telling me all about my mother - and I wasn't being unreasonable or playing poorly or anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No idea if I can do them, never tried.<br />

I have cleared most hc raids whilst current since wrath and been raiding in progression guilds (and running those raids) since TBC, and also in other games like Rift which makes wow raids look like ez-mode.<br />
<br />
I've never used ilevel as a judge of someones abilities, I wont use proving grounds.<br />
<br />
It probably wont make a lot of difference to me personally, but it will impact what little remains of wow community. the cancer that was gearscore is going to be replaced with proving grounds achv as well.<br />
<br />
Ifyou cant see how this negatively impacts both community, and will act as a barrier to new people getting into raiding...well, I dont know how I could make it more obvious.</div></div><hr />

The same minimum ilvl and other things that people use now to somehow determines ones ability to raid will now be used in actual UI that Blizzard puts in and not something like OQueue, simply amazing, not. People have always had the option to be selective when it comes to whom the let in their groups, hence this change is really nothing new. Well I guess it automatically tell the person to what level of proving ground someone master, which is another useless tool if you been raiding forever in the same group of people, if your in a pug well good luck, because even ilvl can't always determine whom is skilled and eventually those that could barely get by the proving ground will get geared enough to beat it, unless of course it scales up forever.</div></div><hr />

I never seen a bad player with proving ground title.

<br />
Yea, this of course will be useful for maybe the first tier level then even the numb nuts will have enough gear to beat, so you keep thinking this is some major step forward. Because where there is a will there most certainly always away. This long with the many that use ilvl catch a few, but never all. I saw nothing in the current form of proving ground that I had already knew about my style of play, sure it was bit tough, but manageable and I did it on my balance druid which I do not play as well as the other classes, so I can see the newer one being that hard, because if it is there will be a whole a lot of people not getting to queue for heroic dungeons. What happens when we get to the 2nd tier of raids and dungeons everyone has to back through and obtain gold to do the next level of raids and dungeons? Guess many have not though that far ahead, just amazing how narrow minded people think in this game.<br />

Yea, this feature really does not change the current model that is already in use in the game, other than someone lower than your level can't ask for a higher one to get in, but why would someone be stupid enough to join such a group in the first place.

It doesn't mean anything. Not to long term people. It taught me nothing I didn't already know, stuff I've been doing since 2005. None of the concepts presented were new or helpful to me. I know not to stand in the shit, I know to interrupt certain spells, it's not hard. <br />
<br />
Truth be told 30 endless waves is reasonably difficult at entry level gear, but once you're geared, it's not, which is all it takes to faceroll it. It doesn't really teach you much about raiding and is extremely removed from the experience, 5 man trash it could fill in for. Maybe. But not for a 25 man raid.</div></div><hr />

You sound like one of those people who complain that the Brawler's club isn't tailored to work for your class and spec perfectly. Adapt or gtfo scrub. :p<br />
<br />
In all seriousness though it takes about 20mins to do the proving grounds and the way its currently designed it shows people are capable of moving, dpsing and interrupting the right targets at the right time. While also having a basic understanding of raid mechanics. <br />
<br />
If they're updating it for WoD its likely going to be a lot better than it is currently, and therefor a useful and imo necessary requirement.</div></div><hr />

Neither bronze nor silver proving grounds are any sort of challenge to anyone who has any idea of what they're doing. Any class/spec can get gold. I'd wager any class/spec could also get the &quot;proven&quot; ranks for their respective roles as well.</div></div><hr />

Probably 20% of the time I click on a group to try and join it does nothing. I like the idea but it just isn't very polished.<br />
<br />
OpenRaid on the other hand, I love. I don't think this will really affect it as it's more of a community site for finding groups (and staying out of WoW trade chat) versus blind groups like Oqueue.<br />
<br />
The minimum iLvl thing is great. I can't stand those in Oqueue who want 550+ (as an example) and then I join and they are in like 535 gear. Same thing for OpenRaid with those trying to get carries.<br />

<br />
Aside from the minor revamp of the raid browser in 3.3 back in 2009, and the option for cross realm listings of the browser in 5.4.2 there aren't any. Here are the patch notes for the raid browser:<br />
<br />
MoP Patch 5.4.2 (2013-12-10): Cross-Realm raid browser now has new categories for Mists of Pandaria World Bosses (Celestials and Ordos) and Flexible raid difficulty for Siege of Orgrimmar.<br />
MoP Patch 5.0.4 (2012-08-28): Now only accessible via the Other Raids button in the Raid List.<br />
Cataclysm Patch 4.3.0 (2011-11-29): Overshadowed by the Raid Finder.<br />
WotLK Patch 3.3.0 (2009-12-08): Added.<br />
<br />
http://wowpedia.org/Raid_Browser<br />
<br />
It has had ONE change since it's inception, which added cross realm listings. Other than that, it is /exactly/ the same as it has been since 3.3. You can't just make crap up and expect someone not call you out on it. Which is exactly what I'm doing because you were so full of it in your original post.<br />

OpenRaid has existed only since 2012, not long after the advent of cross realm groupings. I'll agree nobody uses the raid browser, but nobody EVER has, even before cross realm and OpenRaid were a thing. Even then, OpenRaid/OpenQueue have only taken off as big as they have fairly recently with the advent of LFG/Flex making it easier to get into proper raiding.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has tried time and time again to replace openraid and openque but attempts have failed. While this tool looks good on paper, people will find it annoying after awhile and return to spamming the trade chat with their ilevel.<br />
<br />
Did you start playing WoW like a month ago?<br />
<br />
It's certainly true that they've never managed to release a LFG tool that took off. OR and OQ are recent inventions spurred largely by the opening up of cross realm raiding and the fact that for some silly reason Blizzard still hasn't created a global chat channel, let alone a cross server one. Which in my opinion, is and always has been a silly move.<br />
<br />
I hope this tool works out, I really do.</div></div><hr />

Those raids literally get cleared on every difficulty days after release, they are such a joke.<br />
<br />
you killed Laethys within a few days of release? Damm, should let everyone in the community know and you can claim your world first title. Of course you'll need to back that up, which I suspect may be a problem for you.....</div></div><hr />

Exaggeration aside, it is gear dependent when it shouldn't be.<br />

<br />
The way the system works is to provide transparency and cut of many ways people are looking for to get carried. For example, people whining about proving grounds rank being shown clearly only do so because now everyone will be able to see that they never did proving grounds, whereas beforehand one had to go to the armory in order to see this. <br />
<br />
All it adds is more information about the person you're inviting to the raid. If you believe this feature is a negative aspect of the LFG tool, this begs the question. It means that you would want your proving grounds score to essentially be less accessible to everyone else. The only reason to this that i can imagine is that you have a bad proving grounds score. Your proving grounds score however would be relevant only to a raid leader that considers the proving grounds score a significant showcase of skill and class knowledge (I would personally agree with this, i have seen many bad 14/14hc cleared players but very very few bad players with a &quot;proven&quot; title). So what this means is, you want to lie about your qualifications/experience to your (potential) raid leader. This is literally the only way this feature can be harmful to you. <br />
<br />
Proving grounds is a fair assessment of your skill, to an extent. Yes, it is not completely balanced around class and spec in MoP, and a large (not all of it) part of this is that item level scales down to 463, whereas in PvE, classes are balanced and tuned around having 540-580 (i.e current content) gear. In WoD, blizzard has stated that proving grounds will scale up to your item level, not the other way around(i'm pretty sure i read a tweet about this). <br />
<br />
edit: also, lol at the person saying they needed to nerf bronze and silver. If anything, they should somewhat buff silver in order to make the jump in difficulty from bronze to silver and silver to gold comparable.</div></div><hr />

I can't speak on current content pre-expansions, but the guild I was in over there burned down Akylios within like 1 month after the raid released. Rift content is not difficult, not saying WoW content is hard really either. However if I had to give the a difficulty comparison Heroic Lich King was more difficult than any raid content I experienced in Rift, but Rift has WoW for interesting encounters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pve: raid leader needs to be able to see the applicants raid progression in all difficulties, and the raid leader needs to be able to see if any off-spec gear or pvp gear is currently equipped.<br />
<br />
Pvp: raid lead needs to be able to see applicant CR, and also be able to see if any off-spec gear or pve gear is equipped.<br />
<br />
Simply showing the iLvl of a toon is not sufficient for me as a raid lead, and I would continue to use openraid and OQ to fill raids.</div></div><hr />
