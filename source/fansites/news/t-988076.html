<br />
I'm expecting, and frankly, hoping, that we're getting some base damage nerfs. I've finally given in this expansion to try Arcane, and it is so easy over the other two specs, it's not even remotely funny. 75% potential uptime on Arcane Power is overboard.<br />
<br />
Edit: Ignore. Keep forgetting that the CDs are only reduced when you GAIN a stack, so you have to wait for the Spell effect to consume the stacks before it will start reducing the CD.<br />
<br />
In light of that, the 7 seconds per stack gained makes less sense since you'll already be down to 75 seconds remaining before the CD starts to be reduced. The CD with expire BEFORE casting 10 ABs.....</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocca70d558a3</div><div class="date">2011-09-29, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mage bonuses are a little odd, Arcane will cast more ABs than Frost/Fire do their respective fillers but the buff will stack quicker for Arcane And Arcane Power will will be up much quicker. I understand Haste does less for Arcane and that AP won't be giving its full effect every other CD it's used but still seems strange to have a such a disparity between the specs and what the bonus gives them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That bonus didn't get touched...<br />
<br />
Anyway, glad they changed the Ret 2P bonus, less RNG is always a good thing for us, and it's 1 more Holy Power every 8 seconds, with the usual chance at a Divine Purpose proc, no idea how powerful this bonus would be, but seems pretty solid to me now that it no longer depends on RNG.<br />
<br />
The reduction in the Prot 2P seems weird... 30% of a Judgement didn't look like much already, now it's lower... I may be wrong though, never noticed much of my Judgement damage as Prot honestly...<br />
<br />
Nice to see they're fixing a lot of the issues people had with some of the bonuses, wasn't just expecting it to happen this quickly.</div></div><hr />

Drastically? Perhaps, I just see us using Arcane Power on practically every fight now, and multiple times during a fight. Honestly this is one of the hottest tier set bonuses I have seen for mages. <br />
<br />
I just see us sticking to normal rotations until maxed, blowing arcane Power then continuing with our normal rotation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BAH!<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, a melee running away from the boss to optimize his dps is totally ok. Doesnt matter if we are a mobility class, the idea is stupid. Make a mage have to run to melee every 20 seconds in order to max his dps and the QQ would be enormous.<br />
<br />

The other tank set bonuses improve personal cooldowns to affect the raid as well, Divine Guardian style. It doesn't benefit them personally either. Considering we already have Divine Guardian available, they wouldn't give us a second one with that bonus, and instead, improved what we already have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 2 piece is a bit better for we non-Disc Priests, but in all honesty there won't be much healing to be done once we're finished channeling since those damn resto Druids will have taken advantage of our +healing buff we've patiently spent time channeling onto everyone and topped off the raid. Disc Priests can also double dip alot more effectively than we can since they can squirrel away PI for themselves and thus use on demand and can use Hymn as a second raid CD on top. The 4 piece still doesn't seem great for non-Disc Priests. Might make us slightly better at tank healing and allow for Sanctuary to be on the floor at all times but compared to the benefits for Discipline it's laughable.<br />
<br />
I'm not entirely convinced that the change to the Shadow 2 piece was necessary, mana isn't an issue unless multi-dotting and should be a trade off anyway. Not being able to use SW: Death for Masochism would allow us to free up 2 extra points which we could then use to access Silence for an actual raid assist.</div></div><hr />

by logic it would mean 75% arcane power uptime, as arcane power cd starts the count when you activate it does it not?, so every AB you do after that lessens the cooldown by 7 seconds, thinking people prolly have 1.3 second cast times atm.. thats 13 seconds to stack it to 10.. meaning you have 5 sec window without ap and you can ap again? surely 7 seconds cant be right^^</div></div><hr />

Demo doomguard already lasts 20 seconds longer than affliction or destruction's. Giving it additional time on top of that with the 2pc says &quot;hey, warlocks play demo&quot; Hopefully this change means that the Doomguard doesn't get hit with the nerf bat too hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These are no better than the last bonuses, and I'll explain why; Divine Hymn will be very powerful and it is a 10s (unhasted) channeled spell. To have 13s reduced mana cost after a Hymn cast, the AoE have to be so incredibly heavy and looong, in many/most of the encounters, for us to gain full benefit from this, wich I highly doubt.<br />
<br />
The same thing goes for Sanctuary going from 18s (wich is already very long!) to 22'ish seconds duration. Stack up in a small spot for 20+seconds requirement for this bonus to be any effective, wich I highly doubt will be the case in many fights (atleast I hope we can get away from this &quot;stack at 1 point&quot; tactics, wich are getting terribly boring).<br />
<br />
Another question is; Do disc need this amount of mana savings?? Really...?</div></div><hr />

The reduction in the Prot 2P seems weird... 30% of a Judgement didn't look like much already, now it's lower... I may be wrong though, never noticed much of my Judgement damage as Prot honestly...<br />
Don't forget that it will push glyph of judgment for protadin (10% more damage -&gt; 10% more absorb). And 33% was probably too much for the devs, 28% more in the line with other tank (and being allready CTC capped is enough of a benefit for paladin and warrior, giving them amazing 2p absorb versus average 2p for DK/bear is meh)</div></div><hr />

It's not GoAK. It's Divine Guardian (aka Raidwall). They're giving all the tank-specs a raid cooldown since some don't have them, and they're making Prot Pallies' cd better, in that you don't have to be grouped to get the advantage from it. Even on a relatively close-quarters fight like phase2 of Rhyolith, it was easy to be out of range of your tank if you were running away from a lazer.<br />
<br />
I'm glad they buffed the Elemental 2pc, still kinda boring (in that it doesn't change how I play at all) but at least now it's significant. My napkin math says ~600 DPS from the 2pc, but it'll only get better with more haste. I'll drop 4pc T12 ASAP, as that does nothing for DPS.<br />
Not looking like I'll ever use 4pc, due to the overpowered-ness of T12 2pc. Hopefully Heroic Protector shoulders drop one of these weeks.<br />
<br />
New Warlock 4pc is pretty cool, they've needed a better way to keep soulshards up in combat for a while now. Might make ISF tolerable, idk. Destro needs more buffs than that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow. Arcane Power's cd is 90 sec with the talent. The set bouns reduces the cooldown by 70 sec after 10 casts. THe cooldown now is 20 sec. And the duration of Arcane Power is 15 sec.<br />
<br />
Yeah, wonder what the idea there is, cause that doesn't seem at all sane. <br />
Also, I wonder, when Dragonwrath casts an Arcane Blast, will it grant a stack of Stolen Power also?</div></div><hr />

With the buff from the rehashed talent, this could prove quite interesting. <br />
<br />
I'm hoping it applies at the END of the cast rather than at the beginning (probably won't though) so that we don't lose half of the buff's uptime within the DH channel. That would be dumb. <br />

Pff you say that like you're unaware that even with the buffs Elemental's gotten this summer, Balance is a far better spec, in both utility and damage.

2k mastery during EM (about 15/90seconds for me, with 2600 haste), is worth around 600 DPS, or about 2% damage boost. It's a big number, and a good set bonus if it goes live, but it's not insane (like 2pc T12).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you serious? Have you played a ret paladin in cata? Ret paladins dps are based around white hits (3.5 seconds long white hits), RNG out the butt, and CDs. One of the major attacks can be used after three holy power are activated. It takes ~3.5-4 seconds to use that HP generating move. So every ~12 seconds you can use another attack for some damage. But wait. Every 30 seconds or so you need to use another ability to increase your holy damage so that you can compete with others. So that is another rotation of 12 seconds that gets killed. Every so often, or never, or always do rets get a proc that lets them do this for free without waiting. <br />
<br />
Giving them a second ability within ~4 seconds that gives another holy power means you are now down to roughly ~6-7 seconds for each of your HP abilities. That is a lot of damage. <br />
<br />
As for Zealotry. This is when ret uses its CDs. Now they get to hit even harder every 2 minutes. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, Rets got a really NICE buff to their dps, and as ret, that is all that matters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's because we're not warriors, or what looks like paladins now.<br />
<br />
Warrior T11<br />
2-Piece = Bloodthirst and mortal strike Damage +5%<br />
4-piece = stacking 3% attack power buff<br />
<br />
DK T11<br />
2-Piece = Frost Strike and Death Coil Crit +5%<br />
4-piece = stacking 3% attack power buff<br />
<br />
Warrior T12<br />
2-piece = All shouts give Physical Damage +10% for 12 seconds<br />
4-piece = Mortal Strike and Raging Blow has 30% chance to do 100% weapon damage as fire<br />
<br />
DK T12<br />
2-piece = Horn of Winter gives 3/5ths of 1 runic power per second for 2 minutes &lt;---Worst bonus ever<br />
4-piece = Frost and Scourge Strikes do 6% extra damage as fire damage.<br />
<br />
Now it's going to be paladins with their guaranteed 1 holy power for every judgement they do plus 12% increased damage with zealotry.<br />
<br />
My question to blizzard would be, why not just let us have a damage buff while stuff like unholy frenzy or pillar of frost is up? It's pretty much the same thing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lariel</div><div class="date">2011-09-30, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mage set bonus isn't as strong for arcane as everyone is making it out to be. On the contrary, in my opinion it pretty much sucks, where fire gets the biggest buff and frost is in the middle.<br />
<br />
Why? Simple, fire and frost can use icy veins and combustion at any time during the fight. Arcane mages can't use arcane power at will, they cannot afford to be at 10% mana after using it, without an evocation to use. So unless you have a couple of very friendly druids and no one more important in the raid to get those innervates, you won't be using AP any more often than you do now (which is every 2 minutes when evocation is up), making the cooldown reduction of the set bonus completely useless. Hence they buffed the haste part for arcane.<br />
<br />
And remember that the current tier set bonus is reducing mana costs when using AP, so if you think that it's not a big deal, equip some non-set pieces and try out how much dps you do without using evocation after a burn phase with AP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then there is no logic in incraseing the CD reduction on AP to 7s from 3 if they &quot;unable&quot; to use it. <br />
And AB has 2s cast time while FB got 2.5s. So i dont understand why AB got 100% chance and FB just 50%. So im still confused about the changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the fire being 50% is simple, cause there is no way you wouldnt cast less than 30 fireballs in 1min and 20 seconds.. so it just doesnt have to be.. arcane though, i do understand it being 100% but if they intend us to play with mana and AP.. this set ensures it quite well.. though surely they need to tune down our mana regen now, as i'm currently doing like 1 min 10 sec burns on my mage without hero, though 4 set t12 has some effect on that.. But yerr at least this makes me somewhat interested before getting the huge nerfs^^ <br />
<br />
And oh, those saying that arcane shouldn't do so much dps for being easy.. you might wanna review all specs in the game and find out that there is only a few that arent completely retarded on their rotation, you just cant go wrong with wow anymore rotation wise, and as funny as it is arcane is still 1 of the hardest specs to minmax if there is movement involved at all..<br />
<br />
And here is to hoping fire gets a buff and combustion removed from impact spreading^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats what i was getting at in earlier post, this is t13 n they are co9ming at warriors with t11 set bonuses it seems while almost every other class gets an op bonus we get a chance to refresh something...imo it should b a buff that happens to an attack or something not a chance to refresh something</div></div><hr />

I wish they could figure out a way to maybe get it to both; perhaps lowering it's proc chance and linking it to Bloodthirst would help it favor both specs equally(the proc chance would have to be lower due to BT's lower cooldown, though I'm not sure off the top of my head what that percentage chance should be.) It may help warriors who either A. Favor SMF but like to maximize their performance or B. Are in groups rich in 2H users(ret, UH, DK tanks, etc), or C. Both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless we get any improvement in our mana pool regeneration (evo, gems etc) then it is all but useless.... we'll just go flat oom much faster. Sure I will have done a lot of DPS in a short time and then what? <br />
<br />
As things currently stand (almost BIS gear, legendary staff, shard of woe and current mage 4pc) I am still waiting on evocation timers before I can use arcane power and do a proper burn phase.</div></div><hr />

demonology pets are much stronger and thus the pets are harder to keep up at that level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would likely be the exact reason that the nerf to the bonus was made, cause Judgement (of Truth anyways) just got buffed a fair bit.<br />
<br />
The AP bonus is Melee AP (so basically all AP users except Hunters), so yes, Tanks do get it, since we do use Melee AP.<br />
<br />
And yeah, for both Ret and Prot, that Judgement glyph is starting to look better... now let's see if they decide to de-couple Hammer of Wrath from executre-range, or make it's damage far better after it's crit nerf.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DruidKnight</div><div class="date">2011-10-07, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pff you say that like you're unaware that even with the buffs Elemental's gotten this summer, Balance is a far better spec, in both utility and damage. We're currently rerolling our hunter for h-Rag cause Moonkin is the most useful spec around for that fight. (see: Paragon bringing 3 to kill 10man).<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure that if he plays a boomkin he is well aware of this. This is something you might not be aware of. The reason for this was only for the burst aoe/typhoon pushback. Many guilds stack mages when they require a quicker kill. Boomkins only offer (Eclipse Mushrooms) for aoe so it was just an advantage to beating the mechanics of the fight. Boomkins are far from overpowered. Consider this: Without mushrooms our dots would require 4 sec cast time. each cast 1sec with 1 sec gcd. 4 secs for each mob and since the insect swarm is much weaker in lunar. This is only half the dps it should be. A fight that requires movement.<br />
<br />
Say we just refreshed our dots in solar. Both insect swarm and sunfire are up on the target. The instant starsurge will most likely not be used even if moving. You never want to refresh dots outside of eclipse. Like i said before solar is the strong point and refreshing insect swarm dots in lunar is still done but only if the effect from the solar dots have timed out. Playing a moonkin in a raid is alot like playing a game of chest. You have to plan your moves ahead of time to get the max. dps you possibly can. RNG can royally screw you in many cases because of the balance mechanics of the class.</div></div><hr />

Arcane Power's cd is 90 sec with the talent. The set bouns reduces the cooldown by 70 sec after 10 casts. THe cooldown now is 20 sec. And the duration of Arcane Power is 15 sec.<br />
<br />
&quot;Each stack of Stolen Time also reduces the cooldown of Arcane Power by 7 sec, Combustion by 4 sec, and Icy Veins by 6 sec.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm reading this wrong, but it seems to me that you'd reduce it by 7sec, then 14sec, then 21sec since you gain stacks of Stolen Time with every cast... Sooo it'd be what, 5 casts? Or is it that every time you get a new stack of Stolen Time it reduces the CD on AP by 7sec? I mean, assuming you get to 10 stacks, you wouldn't be able to reduce the CD anymore if it only worked off of new stack additions. Although that could totally be possible. <br />
<br />
I guess it's a stronger case to argue it for Fire and Frost specs since the CDs on those wouldn't be up by the time you got 10 stacks. So it'd really be a sad 4pc for those specs since you'd reduce your CDs by a much lower % than you would for Arcane. Assuming of course you don't reduce the CDs anymore once you reach 10 stacks since you wouldn't be adding new stacks, but refreshing them? I dunno, I guess refreshing the 10th stack would technically be adding a new stack.<br />
<br />
I could just be reading it wrong though.</div></div><hr />
