I guess people will keep sending mails until I post that, right? I won't comment the announcement itself for ... obvious reasons.<br />
In the days and weeks ahead, we’ll be adding more content to the Public Test Realms in preparation for the upcoming patch and the final confrontation with the Lich King. While we’ve shared some of what’s coming already, and players will be able to see a bit more of what’s waiting in Icecrown Citadel during our testing, you may see some other websites digging into the data files and posting some pretty serious spoilers beyond what players will be able to experience on the PTR.<br />
<br />
We’ve put thousands of hours of work into crafting an epic conclusion to the Wrath of the Lich King story, and we’re excited that we’ll soon be able to share it with everyone -- however, we also think the surprises we’ve got in store are best experienced within the context of the game itself. Should you wish not to have your Icecrown experience spoiled, we advise you to steer clear of any sites data-mining and posting this content. And if you do seek out spoilers, we ask that you please be mindful of your fellow players on the official forums. We’re looking forward to hearing about your adventures once the new content is available on the live realms. <br />
<br />
It's a good occasion to explain you what you will find or not find on this page. In the past weeks I tried to stay away from spoiling details on the fight against Arthas and the end of the Icecrown Citadel and it probably won't change (even if it would be tempting to post it now), yes it also includes the AWESOME FROSTMOURNE ROOM (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/october/frostmourne_room.jpg) added to the citadel a few days ago. That's also why you can stop sending mail about the video of Arthas released a few days ago, forums won't get moderated but the front page shouldn't spoil too agressively. <br />
<br />
Yes, the Frozen Throne was greatly updated since the first time I posted it, and at this point there are enough data in the files to figure out some of the mechanics of the fight against Arthas. But I also know that raids are really different in Wrath of the Lich King and pretty much anyone should be able to experience the end of Icecrown Citadel within a few weeks, that's a pretty good reason to not spoil it as much as end-bosses in TBC when only 1% of the playerbase had a chance to see them. <br />
<br />
I'm still unsure if I will post what happens to the Lich King after you defeat him (if we assume that the lore will start changing before the pre-Cataclysm patch) it won't take more than a few minutes before it's all over the forums when sound files will be available on PTRs. I'll probably try to avoid posting transcripts of dialogues of end-game events and anything lore related as much as possible, I never really did that in the past and don't plan to change it. I might post previews of bosses models at some point because you will eventually see them on the boss pages or on PTRs anyway. <br />
<br />
Basically, I'm not going to spoil just for the sake of spoiling, however I won't withold information either if it's available everywhere.<br />
<br />
Feel free to suggest things in comments, I'd be happy to hear what you have to say about what should and shouldn't be on the front page. (No, we're done with the running in Paris thing, don't even ask) <br />

Tier 10 Sneak Preview Update!<br />
Blizzard updated their preview of Tier 10 Armor and changed all the old screenshots with new ones. They now have the proper high-res textures and more classes are available. <br />
We have just updated the Tier 10 Sneak Preview page with the latest sets fresh from the PTRs. Take a moment to check out the new look for the death knight, druid, hunter, and warrior classes. We have also added the sets for mages, rogues, and warlocks. Keep an eye on this page for more updates coming soon!<br />

<br />
you should post things unapretiate for the frontpage in a special spoilers thread in the forums, so people can decide wether to see the spoilers or not. im no fan of raiding, but im interestet in lore. i enjoy spoilers. i realy respect your work and i think youre capable of a way better content-compilation than anyone in the mmoc comunity.<br />
<br />
sorry for my english.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I can't agree with that - if you want a spoiler you will find it anyway if it's under your nose or not - on the other hand if I don't want to be spoilered I always have the choice not to read it (given it is marked as spoiler). That principle is working on many websites and only too often I really do _not_ click on the tempting &quot;reveal spoiler&quot; button and decide to experience first hand. Anyway - it's your choice really.</div></div><hr />

Well once there's a world 1st kill of Arthas then will be a good time to show us all the goods because most of us wont ever see him even if it isn't as bad as the Sunwell.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
A simple system like the Verification code where you have to you the above letters in order to access the spoiler page would be light and simple. It would keep both sides happy &amp; pretty much eliminate spoiler-hater mails. Even if you add a new forum page that people can add spoiler related subjects to, again using a code or something to enter in case someone accidentally clicked on it who wanted to keep everything a surprise.<br />
<br />
I haven't played WoW for quiet a while now and it's becoming difficult to keep up-to-date with the spoiler related subjects without The king of WoW news. We want to see the awesomeness of the Frostmourne room!<br />
<br />
But please don't release the Arthas battle ending to anyone, it deserves to be a surprise.</div></div><hr />

Look at the last 3 words. They've been deleting topics with 3.3 spoilers, I believe, purely so it isn't ruined for everyone else. And good job to Blizz there for keeping it spoiler free as best they can.<br />
<br />
Boub, you didn't need to justify yourself. It's your website, after all! By posting spoilers, you'd probably be spoiling it for yourself too, which isn't fair.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trial of the Crusader was a virtual blackhole of lore. The community is starving to death. Everywhere you look lore freaks are dying. The nothingness of trial has taken its toll. <br />
<br />
On that note is there actually a sweet frostmourne room? Someone's life may depends on it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm personally not a lore junkie, and frankly don't really care what happens to any of the npc's after the lich king is defeated. I'm just in it for a good time while raiding for a few hours. <br />
<br />
That being said, those who do enjoy the story and don't want it spoiled shouldn't have it thrown in their face. In the past you have put spoiler alerts up and thats cool, but the thousands of people on the forums will carry on about every detail for weeks anyways.</div></div><hr />

That's what I had in mind when I said &quot;I won't comment the announcement itself&quot;. Asking people to not post 3.3 information on official forums is one thing, telling them to stay away from fansites is a move I can barely understand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well to be 100% honest with you, the datamining is not something they can stop, but it is something they really do not enjoy people doing. So it makes perfect sense that they would ask people to avoid sites spoiling the content they spent countless hours on etc.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong, I love mmoc, but blizzard has a right to wanting to provide people with their &quot;surprises&quot; head on, rather than having them leaked prematurely through a third party.<br />
<br />
That being said, I really enjoy your posts bob, and I definitely enjoy the spoilers myself, I just understand both sides of the fence and wanted to get that out there. <br />
<br />
Keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />

My first thought was &quot;That's like saying: if you don't want to get burnt you shouldn't put your hand in the fire.&quot;. I think it is meant, that you should stay away from places that may spoiler you as long as they can spoiler you. It's not &quot;fansites are bad&quot;, is it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do have a thought though. I compare this site to another spoiler site but for a television show, the TV show Lost. And the site is Darkufo.blogspot.com. Its (arguably) the most popular Lost spoiler site on the net, in the same fashion that this site is the best for the latest WoW info.<br />
<br />
Maybe u can use that site as a bases on how u handle spoilers for WoW in the future? Maybe have spoilers hidden behind a tag, that u can click on (like a &quot;are u sure&quot; button or something that reveals the content). I guess u would still run into the problem of ppl revealing the spoilers themselves in the comments section so would need someone to monitor the comments and that would become a hassle, so dunno.<br />
<br />
Just a thought, but anyways, keep up the good work!</div></div><hr />

Hello this is a spoiler with the space in between being dark black and only readable after selecting the text or something?<br />
Removes the need for any spoiler tags in titles or the actual topic itself and still removes the &quot;i didnt want to read that yet&quot; argument since you actively have to select the text to make it readable.<br />
Its just an idea, and im sure your smart enough to figure out how to implement it.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Blizzard is somewhat to blame here tho.<br />
They talked about some (ingame) vids related to the fight that might spoil something about the lore, well, these really dont need to be included in ptr files (now or in the future) since the testing needed on those is slim to none.<br />
The only thing that has to be tested is the triggering of the actual video due to whatever ingame mechanic (The quest completion with Wrathgate for example) and thus doesn't have to be included in anything but a live build.<br />
<br />
Sure their argument that they spend thousands of hours working on content is valid, but then spend another few to limit the exposure of spoilers from the ptr.<br />
Its not as if fan sites only started to dig true datafiles yesterday, and the last ptr builds are almost an exact copy of the retail release.<br />
Spoiler proof your content, because if you dont some of it will leak, that really cant come as a suprise to anyone.<br />
<br />
Whatever you decide to post (or not post) on the frontpage is up to you of course, but blizzard shouldnt go to war with fansites just because they didn't prevent spoilers from being posted.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goatonlb</div><div class="date">2009-10-22, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well to be 100% honest with you, the datamining is not something they can stop, but it is something they really do not enjoy people doing. <br />
<br />
I think they also enjoy the free publicity that popular sites like this one promote. It keeps people interested, even after they've stopped playing. They can see something they find intriguing on here, and possibly reactivate. <br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I understand not spoiling the supposed &quot;best&quot; content the game has to offer for the people that will get a chance to see it. I'm biased the other way though, having recently dropped out of raiding, I won't get to see the content either. I use this site as the primary information source for my guild still, to keep them updated on information as it comes out. I do think spoiler-alert type posts that link to a page with the information would be ok - so people know what they're getting into before they click it, but I'm sure the &quot;I couldn't resist&quot; argument would come up, and you'd still get hate mails.<br />
<br />
In short (not really a TL:DR), I want the information posted (with some sort of security measure), but understand if you don't.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you, but imho it is alot harder to limit the spoilers like you are saying than what people think. I am not sure about the whole process of their testing, or anything to do with it for that matter, but I think they would try to cover it up better if they really could.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a really twisted way of looking at it...besides it's not contradictory at all...they want to be the ones to unveil their content, and they have that right.<br />
<br />
In reality they are providing the content, and probably do what they can to cover up what they want, but in the end they need to unveil it in some way that the dataminers will get ahold of it. All they are asking here is for people to try not to go to the dataminers and find out the ending to part of their epic storyline before the content is even released.</div></div><hr />

Being something they can actively control and decide on while sites/datamining is only controlable to the degree of what they put into the local clients... depends on what amount of work is put into either one of those.</div></div><hr />

Not adding boss completion vids to gamefiles cant be that hard.<br />
And if the trigger of such a vid has to be tested either add a rickroll or an old vid, it doesn't have to be the actual vid by any means.<br />
Sure, there is some stuff that cant be prevented and has to be in the game files (Death animations for example) but we learned to deal with that.<br />
<br />
But going on a crusade against fansites and actually telling people to stay away because you are going to add vids to the gamefiles that those fansites may or may not post is bad on any lvl.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pfunkmort</div><div class="date">2009-10-22, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IDK man. To say that it's somehow hypocritical to say, &quot;I'm posting spoilers&quot;...&quot;don't look at the spoilers accidentally if you don't want to&quot;...&quot;here are the spoilers&quot;....doesn't fit with me. Obviously, it's the privilege of the author to write what they want to write - pretty sure we don't have some fascist content authority in this country (let's not get too deep into that), so if you solidly don't feel right or comfortable putting all of blizzard's dirty dark little secrets out there, then don't. Obviously WoW is a series of content patches - half of the work for which is in presentation and in giving the consumer (11 million or however many there are who spend so much time with it) an experience. They spend billions on it. And it's not like you're specifically in the business of ruining the work and lifeblood of Blizzard. I think the basic nature of this site is pretty antithetical to such a pursuit.<br />
<br />
However, I will say, while not condemning your decision, or lauding it...I was a little disappointed to see that you're taking a flat, deadpan, can't-break-these-cuffs silence on the issue. It's a fine line - between forcing the information on the dedicated mmoc readership who may or may not want to know what happens when they get done with a month's work, and keeping your sizable work on datamining from those who want to see it. So who knows? But I wish there were some more reliable and trusted medium for my information than a million dead and false links to diet pills and rickrolls that I will invariably get googling for this for hours.<br />
<br />
TLDR - PST me mah spoilers pl0x.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not necessarily. If they need to add these files for one reason or another (once again, not sure if they would, but it's possible) then that would constitute for everything they are asking for. Also, putting a bunch of time into attempting to block dataminers(virtually impossible) would probably hinder some work done on actually getting the patch out, which is probably something they dont want to compromise.<br />
<br />
They are also not asking people not to visit fansites, they are just asking people to try and avoid datamined content on these sites</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Which is the soul problem behind not posting em.<br />
If the top10 fan sites all decide together to not post about the lore of the TLK fight random fansite #28 will.<br />
Some people are dying for information, and will go to whatever place that provides it.<br />
And if that's on one of the major fan sites they will read it there, if its on a site with 100hits a day they will go and read it there.<br />
Someone WILL post it if its available, which puts the main fan sites behind due to moral reasons.<br />
The only fail save way to prevent it is not adding it to your datafiles, which yes of course, will cause other problems or cant be done with everything, but adding it and then telling people not to datamine it wont work. <br />
Its one of the problems the PTR had ever since they started that project;<br />
You want to test stuff with people doing the actual content while keeping spoilers to a minimum, which is extremely hard to accomplish.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spoon77</div><div class="date">2009-10-22, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello - quite a long time reader, not much of a poster. I browse MMO at least 8-10 times a day looking for updates though!<br />
<br />
I did feel the need to post for this though, so I hope you take the time to consider what I'm writing. I come to MMO especially for spoilers. Like many of your readers I don't want to use the forums, nor do I have the time/patience to scower through the forums to get the info. If you do continue the stance and we can get the info elsewhere, we will. That's just stating the obvious, but this website has always served one quite specific purpose for a large majority of your readers and if you do pull it alltogether then you will be alienating a substantial majority of your casual (i.e. non-forum user) readership. <br />
<br />
Why a news based site would consider potentially diverting its traffic elsewhere and creating an opportunity for competition to take an advantage, I don't know. People know MMO as a &quot;spoiler&quot; website and that's how I, for one, hope it stays. I think you should focus on giving people the choice on what to read. I would be happy to click on something in the side bar that says spolier news (for example). <br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck on however this pans out for you.</div></div><hr />

They're saying &quot;we're preparing some special, awesome event, so please, don't spoil it for yourself&quot;. <br />
<br />
It's legitimate and understandable. Roleplaying games have a story, and spoiling itself for you can destroy an awesome moment. Back when I was a kid, I played FFVII and *spoilers* as everyone knows, when Aeris died I was floored and shocked and awed and that moment would have been completely destroyed by me knowing it first.<br />
Whenever a new Final Fantasy game, or an RPG of any kind, be it Mass Effect or Dragon Age, is approaching, I shut myself out of fansites (or a Metal Gear game, or anything with a meaningful story). I don't wanna ruin it.<br />
<br />
<br />
And here we get to the point. Enfasis on &quot;meaningful story&quot;. This is World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Was there anything to &quot;spoil&quot; in the Yogg Saron fight, or the Illidan fight, or the Nefarian fight? Was there any story element present, any awesome twist, anything to ruin at all? This problem never arised, because the storytelling in WoW has always been either mediocre or nonexistant. Was there anything to spoil in the Illidan encounter?<br />
<br />
The problem arises now because now Blizzard is probably trying to put something in this event. They're probably investing energies in creating some twists and turns in the fight to awe the players. And people is datamining them and dissecting them way before the instance is released. I understand their frustration because we will be probably reviewing the Arthas fight before 3.3 is deployed on servers, but isn't it a bit late to try and put enfasis on story in a game that lived off 10 lines of dialogue per instance for 5 years?<br />
<br />
Hard to suggest Boub what to do. My personal feeling, and that is the perspective of an RPG buff who was mildly fond of Warcraft 3's story, and someone who doesn't consider the WoW lore anything special but still one of the best things the game has to offer, is that if these events are as &quot;awesome&quot; (which is the world they used to describe the grand climax they were building for ICC, which was later known as Trial of the Crusader, cough) as the past one, feel free to spoil away. A part of me thinks that this time they will get it right, but it will be too late and we will be spoiled anyways.<br />
Another part of me thinks that they built up this event having worked on Arthas, the ghost child Arthas, Tirion, Wrynn and Thrall and Jayna, Frostmourne and Shadowmourne and Ashbringer and Quel'dar, and Darion and Alexandros and Bolvar and 2 Saurfangs and Malganis and I could go on and on... they're putting so much stuff in the stew that I fear it won't taste of anything.</div></div><hr />

You felt it perfectly fine to spoil ABSOLUTELY every single aspect of the Cataclysm announcement weeks before BlizzCon, but suddenly it's wrong to show us a picture of something that's not even finished?<br />
<br />
How much did Blizzard push your way to keep things quiet?<br />
<br />
<br />
He didn't really spoil things about Cataclysm, he just publiziced the spoilers Blizzard would tell a few days earlier, and in such both spoiling blizzards spoiler and creating a mass hype for blizzcon for which you could pay 40 dollars and watch it at home.<br />
<br />

<br />
To those saying they *only* come here for the spoilers, is that really true? Personally I visit mmoc each day for the quality of the news stories, the humour in the replies and because it mostly beats doing work. If I wanted to seek out spoilers then I'd find an alternative site and read that 'aswell'.<br />
<br />
I largely believe the decision is based on the fact that people link to mmoc from the official forums, and I suspect boub fears that these links will be moderated out much like they do for links to sites which make use of gold selling advertising... but I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
What concerns me more is that we have had 6 pages of replies and nobody has found a way to blame this on 'casuals' ;)</div></div><hr />

Blizzard didn't push anything, MMO-Champion isn't part of the official fansite program and Blizzard NEVER asked me to remove anything from the front page. Other sites had to remove the picture of Lavaman tho. <br />
<br />
Also, I didn't spoil every single aspect of the Cataclysm announcement, I only spoiled features and eventually had to throw some lore in because someone added the information on Something Awful, it wasn't the original plan but as I said I won't ignore the info if it's out there.</div></div><hr />

/agree to an extent. I came from a background of story-based games, so I understand the want to complete the story yourself. Playing any FF game though, you control how long it takes to see the content, at which rate, or if you see it at all. In this game, 24 other people also control our ability to see the content, as well as having the time to dedicate towards that goal. In my last post I mentioned recently stepping down from raiding, this was due to work related time constraints. While the desire to raid is still there, and I would love to wait and see, I can't afford to. I'll never see the LK fight on live pre-4.0.<br />
<br />
This puts me (and many other people) in a situation where we desire the information, where it won't spoil anything for us because we may never get to that point. At the same time, there are a great deal of people who WILL get the chance to see this content first-hand, and will most likely enjoy it more going into it excited, not knowing what will happen. <br />
<br />
Probably 90% of the guilds that do attempt him though (totally made up %), will have read a strat on how to do the fight by the time they reach it anyway. Only cutting edge guilds will get there first, and once they do, nearly all the information or surprises will have been leaked many times over. My point is that there's no reason to NOT leak the information now if it's available, because half the people won't ever see it, and almost all of the other half will read the information before seeing the fight anyways. The 10% pro players can have the self-control to not click a link, and grats on their server firsts. <br />
<br />

Go through your original Cataclysm pre-Blizzcon release. Then watch the Cataclysm trailer. Tell us which parts your didn't reference or downright say.<br />
<br />
It's funny how you run your site the same way your years, never a care about what you post. Twice have leaked info revealing large portions of the upcoming BlizzCon announcements.<br />

Then suddenly, it goes against some sort of imaginary morale fiber that you suddenly adhered to once Blizzard says &quot;Don't go to those sites&quot;.<br />

People don't change years of activity and method for no reason at all, and I love how you say it's because this is Icecrown. Was it not Icecrown when you posted Lavaman? Was it not Icecrown when you posted the Shadowmourne quest info?</div></div><hr />

I actually registered just because of this. As far as i understand every person around here has somekind of moreal fiber and i find it important from Boubs point of view to try and accept what Blizz has requested, they never did an announcement of this kind before and it makes sense that maybe he feels its the right thing to do. <br />
<br />
I myself come to this site for info about future game development and spoilers, but as far as i understand we will still get our dose of information about the game (bosses armor sets, new quests and other stuff) just ICC ending will be kept secret for a short while, in the end you will probably know how it ends soon after the new patch is released ( and i will be able to enjoy it as fresh as possible with my guild).<br />
<br />
Also if the deep stuff becomes widely available before ICC comes out and is finished im sure boub will realease it himself with all necessary info you may imagine.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />

I know that in my guild (60ish accounts) only 2 people bought the stream. Personally I didn't, and it's the first Blizzcon I didn't actually follow at all, and I know dozens of people who share the same experience.<br />
<br />
When I saw MMOC had already told me what I was asked to pay 40 bucks for, I sort of felt sorry for those who dished that money for nothing.</div></div><hr />

Moreal = more real? &gt;.&gt; jk.<br />
<br />
They didn't request him to not post anything. They said people WILL post this information on data mining sites, it's in the game files, we know, we can't stop it. IF you don't want to see the spoilers, then stay away from those sites (because it probably will be posted), until you see it for yourself.<br />
<br />
What they said was what Boub should have on the front page, and does....right above the link to where the spoilers should be. It's a warning, not an order.</div></div><hr />

Yes. It actually *is* the only reason I come here. Boub usually posts spoilers before any other sites because he's usually the one that does all the datamining that finds it, and that's what I expect to see on the front page when I come here.</div></div><hr />

But...<br />
<br />
I don't understand the sudden feeling of 'not wanting to spoil' stuff. You posted EVERYTHING about the expansion (which I love you for) ahead of it being announced. I don't understand the difference in the spoilers.<br />
<br />
Like you said, Blizzard didn't bother &quot;asking&quot; you not to spoil it. They jumped right to telling people to not come to your site... Not sure about you, but if I were you, id be a tad angry. LET THE SPOILERS REIGN!</div></div><hr />

I think something similar om the front page would be awesome. Where you write: &quot;Spoiler: contains the end when Arthas has died&quot;, etc and we can simply choose to find out or not instead of poking out our eyes when we read it by accident. ;D<br />

Its obvious what could Blizzards post mean for Boub, therefore i dont understand why should anyone find it wrong<br />
<br />
In any case people coming here have become far too much &quot;Spoiled&quot; as someone has said, Im pretty sure for example Boub had most of the info on cata weeks if not months before he released it, and as we all know one of the reasons for it to be released was the post of lore info on SA forums.<br />

If you cared you'd already know alternative places to go.

It's his site, his perogative, not much else needs to be said. At least he made his stance clear and gave us a heads up that if we want everything spoiled, we should start looking elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

That's purely hypothetical but it does illustrate my point. <br />
<br />
It just doesn't make sense. For someone who's broken some of the biggest exclusives in wow via datamining to turn around all of a sudden and say I won't do it anymore if it spoils the story, that just doesn't feel right. It makes you wonder if they were threatened with an intellectual property based lawsuit if they continued, just like Blizzard did with the copyright claims to remove the Arthas death animations on youtube. This wouldn't surprise me actually, as the tone of his &quot;i will post what is posted elsewhere&quot; sounds like &quot;i will now only post what other people have mined so I cannot be sued for any IP related to datamining&quot;.<br />

Anyway, I'm not going to argue - i've made my opinion clear. I quite like this site but I'm not going to &quot;fight the power&quot;. It's Boub's website and if he wants to do a 180 turn on the theme this site has has been built on, then so be it. Someone else will fill the void, life goes on. <br />
<br />
Nonetheless, this is my last post here as I hate forums in general and don't like this one all too much, but before I log out I do want to say thanks for the good reading over the years. You should be proud that people are willing to argue so passionately over this, it proves that you have a quality product that people like :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gusgus</div><div class="date">2009-10-22, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly I come to this site to see the data mined information, the expected fights and everything else. Frankly, I find it rather hypocritical that you choose to spoiler the information that you want to and hide the rest. In turn, if this site doesn't want to show such information then I would be forced to go to another well known mmo-champion type site to get it. This is like the newspaper, if you hide content that loyal followers go here to see and click your ads to generate revenue for you then I can simply take my loyalty (and ad clicking) elsewhere. No offense to the other readers here but lets be honest, its rather naive to say &quot;I'm not going to spoil this for you because blizzard told me not to&quot; for the first time ever in this website's history to actually follow. Everyone knows about bolvar or something to that extent because you showed it to us. Guess what, that is a spoiler &quot;Shocker!&quot; yet you did it because you know your readers come here for that. Everyone knows Arthas will die and that is not a spoiler. They dynamic of the fight is what we want to see. We all know that guy at the end dies, all we want to see is how it happens nothing more. The game has already been spoiled rotten so refusing to show such information is rather moot. However, I am saddened that you are resorted to this type of stance where you need to ask the readers what they want when you already know it.</div></div><hr />

lol i dont get how boub posted EVERYTHING about cataclysm before it came out which i do know it was all speculation at the time but 95% of it was right so it had to come from somewhere.. but he doesnt want to spoil icecrown. i meen lorewise i think the intensity on both would be about the same<br />
<br />
But don't get me wrong Boub, Ive been coming to this site every day just about since patch 2.3 and i have loved every step of the day, keep up the great work!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is exactly why Blizzard is getting a little annoyed/disappointed, Boub is so good at putting out information beforehand that it's not just good publicity for the game anymore, it actually ruins any sort of surprise Blizzard would like to keep secret for the player base until things are ready.<br />
<br />
I'm not surprised Blizzard is basically begging fan sites not to post *everything* ahead of time, they can't beat them but they can appeal to their gamer fan sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stop being lazy, get your ass on PTR and you will have access to 99.9% of information Boub has access too. He's only bright enough to look deeper into the information.<br />
<br />
There was a screen shot the other days of some speech in ICC, and in between two lines of speech there was a noob asking : ''lul ho u get to icezkrwun radi''. Most of ppl will say, meh it's just insignifiant white, yellow or red text, some others will go and find what that text was supposed to mean. <br />
<br />
Why the hell are you being so retarded ?<br />
<br />
If going by your idea if people want information about something they need to go do it themselves.<br />
<br />
Well no need for tabloid newspapers ill go and be a paparrazi myself , I'll go interview and take pictures of celebrities , I'll go track down the best news stories in the world just so i can can get that information.<br />
<br />
In fact lets just stop printing news papers , all websites and TV stations with any form of information might aswell shut down because everyone should go and find all the information out for themselves.</div></div><hr />

What he gave us about Cataclysm is what Blizzard gave us a couple of days later. But right now, lore around Arthas is so huge and disturbing (I guess) that Blizzard don't want you to live it on forums or PTRs, they want you to live it.<br />
<br />
And honestly, even if you don't read it on MMO-Champ, you will read it in trade chat 48 hours after patch 3.3. The real difference will be, that events entouring Arthas fight...you and I won't have same feelings doing it.</div></div><hr />

My problem with this is, while true, its mostly in bits and pieces, and many of us lack the experience data-mining to really find any good info. That's what sites like mmo champ are so helpful, as the vast majority (if not all findings) are coherent and informative.</div></div><hr />

You said in this post that you would reveal spoiler information only if it's reported elsewhere. However, I don't have time nor do I care to peruse the entire compendium of WoW related sites for this information. I look here because you have been the most accurate and the most reliable. If you're going to quit revealing this new information or make me have to drill down through the drivel of comments in the forums, then there really would be no need for me to visit this site anymore.

<br />
Just avoid posting spoilers on the front page, and if people really, REALLY want to spoil things for themselves, then they can always click the nice colored text and be whisked magically off to SpoilerLand. The rest can remain safe in their ignorance on the front page.<br />
<br />
And don't pretend like it's your right to report the &quot;news&quot; that comes from the PTR, like you're CNN or something. You wouldn't be withholding information from the masses if you refuse to post fight info data mined from the patch files. You have plenty of content to post for WoW fans without being a douche and spoiling story just because you think it's already common knowledge. Please, don't take your cues from the National Enquirer and post things just to get the juicy scoop first. Have some respect for your readers and some class.<br />
<br />
I like this site, and come here daily for WoW news and the occasional leaked armor set or spell changes, and even some boss strats if I'm desperate. but I still like to keep some things hidden for my own enjoyment of the game.

That said anyone can attempt to justify it any way they'd like, but the vast majority of readers come to mmoc to see spoilers, unfinished and work-in-progress content. I'd rather not to go other sites I don't trust. <br />

Although I agree with you Boub, im worried that this will make many choose other data-mining sites. <br />

Sites which many of us would normally choose not to frequent for a variety of reasons.</div></div><hr />

But even if they are placed somewhere else, the people who don't want spoilers will get spoiled in other ways. They will get spoiled in guild chat, trade channel, other forums. People will be quick to open their mouths without thinking about. Usually I get spoiled by people using spoilering titles for new threads.<br />
<br />
For example there could be a thread with a name like this, this is one I made up <br />

QFT.<br />
<br />
I don't really post here often, though I got this site even as my homepage, for a quick read about the news. Though I just can get why Boub wouldn't spoit on a site that's based on spoiling, news and discussing about both. With this act, you are: 1 not spoiling, 2 keeping news to yourself, and then not giving the ability to do the 3rd thing, discussing about it (well, mostly not, we can only QQ about not getting info). Imho this is against all the things this site is build on and I think this is one of the worst things you could have done Boub.<br />
<br />
P.S.: I'm sorry for my poor english.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nekosom</div><div class="date">2009-10-22, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On one hand, I understand what Boub is doing. He is the undisputed king of datamining, and with great power comes great responsibility on that end. On the other hand, he simply invites a pretender to the throne, because inevitably someone WILL step up and datamine that information that Boub is unwilling to divulge. However, that person may not be as good and get incomplete information, which breeds misinformation. Misinformation breeds trolls. Guess where those trolls will go? That's right, MMOChampion.<br />
<br />
My personal perspective is that one either reveals everything they find, or reveals nothing. Being selective about what you will and will not spoil will simply make people trust you less. Apologists will say that Boub can do whatever he wants, and they are correct in saying that. However, so can readers. And if another site gets the information first, I can promise you that is where people will come instead of here. We live in a &quot;What have you done for me lately&quot; society, and there is no honor among thieves. And face it, that's what datamining is; stealing.<br />
<br />
So I appeal to you Boub. You work hard, and there are a lot of people who appreciate it. Even Blizzard does, in their own way. After all, we all know they put those phony Halloween masks in the files just so you could find them. Please, don't abuse that position by choosing what you will or will not spoil. It only muddies the waters in what I find a fun little diversion.</div></div><hr />

I've been playing WoW since release and since MMO Champ has been around I have been visiting it, mainly because it posts spoilers and broadcasts new features/news to the player base before any other website. <br />
<br />
I like many love the spoilers, I'm a big fan of WoW lore but am not a hard core player so experiencing the higher points of the game through spoilers keeps the game alive for me. Reading spoilers gives me a kick and a better insight to the game. <br />
<br />
As others have said if MMO does not reveal the spoilers ahead then sadly i have no real reason to come to the site on a twice/thrice daily basis.</div></div><hr />

It is one of the main reasons I frequent MMO-champion.com. As much as I'd love to just &quot;experience&quot; these new encounters, there is just to much pressure in the raiding world on &quot;knowing the fights&quot; in raiding guilds. So, studying up on the fight completely ruins the epic feeling of being taken off guard. <br />
<br />
So, in my mind, I might as well read about it now. I could go off on a long tangent about &quot;people knowing all the fights and encounters before it even hits live,&quot; but I'm at work and don't have time to riff on it for a while.<br />
<br />
But again, I do appreciate that MMO-champion does post spoilers, and makes sure to post warnings in front of those spoilers for those people out there who wish to read about it later when studying for the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for not spoiling to begin with, why come this far just to not spoil? The death of Illidan was spoiled, but Lich King wont be? It is a view at your own risk but that is being eliminated entirely and that annoys me.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if Blizzard full on asked you to not spoil it, then say so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just like many other people, I come to this site for the spoilers. I suppose that if I still played WoW I wouldn't want to see them, but since I don't, I like to keep up with whats going on in the game and lore by watching this site. I suppose we can always wait until the content is released, but seriously, I think many people come here just for the spoilers, and I can't help but think it will decrease your traffic if you aren't posting those sorts of things.<br />
<br />
Just come up with a new system of spoiler tags (one person suggested word verification earlier, which is fine with me) and I really don't think you can offend anyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, when it comes to such an boss like the lich king and where we are taken, I do not want to be spoiled. Why? Because it will 100000000000000000x epic when it's done and you have no clue what to expect.<br />
<br />
Those complaining are the ones in the shit guilds that will never see him until they hit 5-10 levels over cap. This is Boub's website. If he feels that Blizzard wants people to enjoy it live instead of the forums, then Boub has just as much right to abide to their idea. Do NOT, repeat, do NOT complain that Boub isn't doing his job or is just giving up spoiling everything. Sometimes, too much released info digging straight into the games can be very dangerous.<br />
<br />
As to what Boub said, yes, other sites took down the Lavaman image. Worldofraids actually took a lot of stuff down.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2009-10-22, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that PTR shouldn't even exist in 1st place.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Boub is right. As someone else alread pointed out. The game changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've spoiled Illidan's death!&quot;<br />
<br />
And almost everyone who read it probably only saw him after level 80. So the spoilers were &quot;justified&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should spoil Arthas death now too!&quot;<br />
<br />
The game changed. The general audience isn't anymore in the position of &quot;the other 99% of the player base that will never see these raids&quot;. So you don't need spoilers anymore because a lot of people will be able to open their way (or even faceroll) the 10man version and see for themselves. And remember, unlike Illidan (who is not the TBC last boss, Blizzard knew about that before us), Arthas is the end of the entire W3/WoW main history. It will have a freaking cinematic (or cutscene) after the fight. Did we had it before? Not that I know.<br />
<br />
&quot;i dawn't play anymoar, gimme spoielorz, luv lore!&quot;<br />
<br />
You can wait for when it goes live. People will kill Arthas right away and post everything about it. It's only like a month away.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I won't read your site anymore&quot;<br />
<br />
Your loss... really. Think about it and double check if the site is only worth for spoilers about the last boss death...<br />
<br />
After all that, remember, just need one person knowing about and with the will to spoiler to ruin it for everyone else... you can get it by yourself or other &quot;lesser&quot; sites can do it... but, again, the general audience reads from the big sites. And usually it's from those readers that we get the ones who will start shouting to everyone about what they saw/know. You can't 100% shield yourself about everything else and those suckers in the same server you play for example. You just need to read a few words to have almost everything ruined for you before you notice it. (like the ones who will leave a theater screaming the end of the movie you're about to get inside to watch).<br />
<br />
Most of these jerks are lazy enough to not look for info if they're not in mmo-champ site or other big ones. So that's a win.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leemon</div><div class="date">2009-10-22, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that PTR shouldn't even exist in 1st place.<br />
<br />
<br />
so you're suggesting, that, because people data mine and find the spoilers to what is coming and post it on websites, that the public shouldn't be used to test the latest content? you do realise that'd mean it'd take even longer for patches to come out because there'd be less people testing it and less bugs being discovered right?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goatonlb</div><div class="date">2009-10-22, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The game changed.

<br />

<br />
<br />
99% of the playerbase will still not see the fight before any of this spoiler information is readily known and available anyways. That's my point. It may not be common knowledge right on 3.3 patch day, but there's more than 10 bosses in ICC - only the hardcore are going to clear that with any type of speed and see LK quickly. We don't even know if there are any cock-blocks to the instance/fight yet like Algalon/Anub. If, by the time 99% of your playerbase reaches the final fight, it's already well known about, what's the point of not sharing the information now?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lionhearte0</div><div class="date">2009-10-22, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I want to get my 2 cents in and my opinion on the matter..<br />
<br />
I personally love this site. It's probably in my top 5 sites, and probably the only one I can easily go to to find info on WoW.<br />
That said, Blizzard does an incredible job at keeping secrets. Everyone wants to know those secrets and don't want to wait 3 months to find out, especially if they'll never get to experience said secret (end-game raids). So, it's just my opinion that MMOC should bring out spoilers on a silver platter, if not on a seperate tab that's labelled &quot;SPOILERS&quot; and has a disclaimer when clicked. Can't be at fault for that.<br />
<br />
tl;dr - Spoilers please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You're right. It is hypocrisy. However, it is hypocrisy if and only if you claim you will not post spoilers, but then you do. As far as posting them with the hidden-unless-you-highlight &quot;technology&quot;, how is that hypocrisy? More importantly, why does it matter if people will check? As long as you clearly have it labeled (And you always have in the past) that it will reveal spoilers, it shouldn't bother anyone. That's a much better option than someone accidentally finding them by browsing the forums, IMO. <br />
<br />
That style of posting TRULY gives players the OPTION, in every sense of the word, of seeing spoilers or not. I may disagree with your stance on the matter Boubouille, but don't get me wrong. MMO-Champion is truly THE best World of Warcraft news and information site on the web, all because of the work you do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You're an idiot. You claim you don't want to be spoiled, yet you posted in the other topic about the room, which was clearly a spoiler from the topic title alone! You seem to be one of those people who just want to bitch. <br />
<br />
Yes, it is a little more epic if you get to see it yourself instead of just seeing it on a stream or screenshot. However, it still loses it's luster, and you will see it eventually anyways. Every encounter in this game, hell, even the &quot;hard&quot; modes, have been pugged. There is no such thing as &quot;shit guilds that will never see him until they hit 5-10 levels over cap&quot;. That just makes you sound like an elitist ass. This isn't Vanilla or BC where a very limited amount of people get to see content. This is Wrath of the Casual King, where literally anyone can be geared for the current top-end content within a couple of weeks and clear it. <br />
<br />
No one, I repeat, NO ONE, is complaining that boub isn't doing his job or is giving up. They are simply stating that they would like to see spoilers as he has done in the past, because that's the essence of data-mining and reporting on unreleased content. Spoilers. Did it ever occur to you that the topic title has &quot;WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!&quot; in it, so people expected spoilers that actually &quot;matter&quot;? Or is your head too far up your ass to see that obvious point?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Therefore, saying that you will now be selective about spoilers is (to quote you from an earlier post) &quot;pure hypocrisy&quot;.<br />
<br />
This site exists first and foremost for people to look at datamined content. If you no longer feel like &quot;spoiling&quot; these things for us, then either cease posting all datamined content on your site permanently, or make yourself a hat with the word Hypocrite on it and wear it 24/7.</div></div><hr />

Post the spoilers behind a link that says &quot;SPOILERS HERE&quot;, or maybe &quot;SPOILERS HERE, IF YOU CLICK YOU WILL FIND OUT THE ENDING TO WOTLK, SO PLEASE DON'T CLICK, I REPEAT DON'T CLICK, IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS&quot; if people really are as dumb as you seem to think they are.<br />
<br />
I mean, I assume we all realize that the spoilers will be coming out at some point, and that anyone not making some kind of minimal conscious effort to avoid them will find them out. That's not up to Boub or Blizzard or anyone, it's just human nature. If not this site then some other site.</div></div><hr />
