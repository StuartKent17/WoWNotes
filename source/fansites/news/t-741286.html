<br />
So, people are expected to level to 80 before leaving Northrend. This may make some people unhappy, but I think it is a good change. More stamina across the board sure will make high-level Azeroth much more interesting. :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Arcane mages are actually starting to look very promising. Even Incanter's Absorption is attractive with being procced off damage taken while Mage Ward is active. Very cool. Eg. http://www.wowtal.com/#k=Ze-C3fKI_.9q4.mage ;)<br />
<br />

Liking the warrior changes. Right now there are one or two choices we make in the Arms tree but when we're putting talents in fury, there are lots of talents to chose from.<br />
Right now we have pretty obvious choice, in beta it seems less obvious. But I think in the end the theorycrafters will find out the best cookie-cutter build anyways.</div></div><hr />

Have you been on the beta?, deadly momentum is ridiculous I was able to tank the trash in abbys halls. Honestly blizzard keeps talking about people having choices which means some of your points are probably going to be spent in pvp talents, or flavor talents. Deadly momentum, or improved recuperated are pretty decent flavor talents.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, for t9/t10 5-6k dps char these 31k are gone in 5-6 seconds. Now for someone, who will level a fresh alt and enter Cata 78+ entry zones with green/blue geared level 78 char that does 1-2k dps, it will take 15-30 seconds to kill a single mob. <br />

We can easily compare the health increase for all expansions. <br />
Vanilla -&gt; TBC: 3.8k - &gt; 5k gives ~32% increase<br />
TBC -&gt; WOTLK: 6k -&gt; 8k gives ~ 33% increase<br />
WOTKL -&gt; CATA 12.6k -&gt; 31k gives ~ 146% increase</div></div><hr />

<br />
They probably do this because the all the armor classes will have the same item level within a tier, and therefore same amount of raw stats. You can't just increase the stats on cloth or it defeats the purpose. You could potentially buff the spells of cloth-only classes to compensate but then you could run into problem with them scaling poorly with things like trinkets, necks, and cloaks that have huge amounts of Int (5% of total, not just the armor type items). It was the simplest solution to give them the bonus too.</div></div><hr />

As I stated in my original post, I am aware that there are easy solutions. The point I was making wasn't about the bonus you get from tree form but the fact that they dropped being able to stay in tree form. Druids are shapeshifters. Tree form is a staple for druids. If they are taking away that they may as well take away kitty, battle chicken, and bear forms and adjust the gear/passives/talents to make up the difference. They may as well give spriests their shadowform stats thru the tree and call it a day. It is a matter of principle more than anything else. They used justifications like not seeing armor while shapeshifted or that they are &quot;too hard to kill in pvp&quot; which to be is total crap. There are fixes to that, like you said, that don't have to involve taking away a staple element of being a druid. Aside from all the REAL reasons to play a druid, this is a feature that does appeal to a lot of people, despite being completely superficial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WPL: http://www.wowhead.com/npc=1813 around 3.7k health.<br />
Hellfire Peninsula: http://www.wowhead.com/npc=16871 a pretty average guy, 5.1k health.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: not doubled, but certainly 50%+ health. <br />
<br />
Oh and for the people whining that alts might have a hard (and especially long) time to kill the mobs in Cataclysm starting areas: you get a lot of gear quite fast from the quests, so I wouldn't worry too much about it. Plus at the beginning, the mobs have around 20k health, after like 20-30 quests you get mobs with 28k ish health.</div></div><hr />

At the risk of stating the obvious, it wouldn't be very balanced to give everyone above cloth 5% intellect (ie 5% mana AND spellpower) and not the clothies. Warlocks, Mages and Priests would have 5% less intellect than everyone else which seems a little daft no?<br />
<br />
And to the poster who commented that Paladins etc don't care about armour because you shouldn't be being hit - that's the whole point of these bonuses. You will care about 5% intellect.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard (and some players) had issues with, for example, a holy paladin using armor from every type simply because the armor value stat was meaningless. This was going to be even more common in Cata with the homogonisation of gear - all healers (for example) will want the exact same set of stats. So, they're offering this buff if you stick within your optimal armor type. <br />
<br />
You're not going to get cloth specialisation if you wear all cloth as a holy paladin - that would defeat the purpose. To be honest, I don't even think 5% will even be enough until late game where you have a few tier pieces and the 5% buff means a bit more - you'll still get more benefit by wearing the gear that drops that has the best stats, regardless of what armor class it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, but what he meant was the following: Why award someone a buff for wearing cloth gear when all he can do is wear cloth gear? <br />
Because everyone else is getting a buff for wearing the armor of their class...so why wouldn't cloth get similar?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you think the chances of cloth armor in the same tier are for overcoming those 5% increases to int and by association spellpower? I'm guessing pretty freakin' slim. The issue is obviously understood and being factored in to item design.<br />

<br />
Also why reduce the total effect of the Intensify Rage talent, they said it themselves talents are now worth double what they were before, 2 talents equal 4, thus a talent then before were 3 should not be reduced in strength, hopefully they make it 15 / 30% rather then 10 / 20 ( from 11, 22, 33) and even then it's less then the previous effect / point.<br />
<br />
I love the changes and how they tie the talent-trees together, instead of having the generic increases it increases some specifically or makes the proc of certain abilities rather then everything which makes it feel more tight.<br />
The new Battle-Trance compared to the old Ubridling Wrath is worse, but the effect is more entertaining then a slow steady stream of extra rage.<br />
The new one makes it more worthwhile to use your &quot;main&quot; ability, gives you more random elements ( using a high ragecost ability rather then a weak one due to the proc) and effectively increases your rage beyond 100, if you proc it while you have 100 rage, using an ability will leave you at 100 rage. Instead of the previous one that instead made you more often each 100, where rage was lost.</div></div><hr />

Get off it... this &quot;staple&quot; didnt even exist until TBC. The original druid healers are in caster form decked to the hilt in nature themed armor and staves.

Vanilla -&gt; TBC: 3.8k - &gt; 5k gives ~32% increase<br />
TBC -&gt; WOTLK: 6k -&gt; 8k gives ~ 33% increase<br />
WOTKL -&gt; CATA 12.6k -&gt; 31k gives ~ 146% increase<br />
<br />
<br />
The difference is that there was no simple way for everyone to get full T5 or better in all slots for all toons prior to WotLK. 12.6k -&gt; 31k mattered when folks were in ilvl200 blues/purps. It is meaningless for folks in T9+, which damn near everyone will be on as many toons as they wish. 31k will still be pretty easy, even with tank and heal spec'd folks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tree of Life is not iconic. You can compare it to moonkin form but cat/bear form is a different story. They are truly a staple for feral druids and were in the game right from the start. And they actually change your playstyle. You get a different resource system as well as brand new abilities. I would rather have active shapeshifting than just standing in my form, gaining absolutely nothing but + more damage/heal etc. ToL does not my change my playstyle as one would expect from shifting and so they scrapped it. Moonkins seem to get some neat stuff with the whole eclipse system so they would be more than a skin that gives you + more stat. I welcome this change. ToL will now really change my playstyle by modifying my healing abilities. Getting to see my items is another bonus which I miss from when I started playing. Looks are just a matter of personal preferance but the functunality of ToL will be vastly improved.<br />
<br />
As Blizzard has pointed out so many times, you can't compare shadow priests to resto druids. A dps class does not need to heal. And all other dps classes only dps. However, this is not the case with healers. Every single healer out there can dps without sacrificing anything. And many of them do while farming old content. In PvP every single healer does some sort of dps without sacrificing anything unlike resto druids. So basically, nearly every single dps class can't heal and so shadow priests are not the only one that can't heal. Resto druids are the only healer out there which has to sacrifice so much in terms of global cooldowns and mana just to dish out some dps. It doesn't seem fair to me...<br />
<br />
Ooh, and Blizzard will mostly give us a minor glyph which changes your appeance to ToL and thus making it completely optional to use. So I wouldn't be bothered that much about the skin itself. However, some people find this unacceptable which leads me to believe that these people want to force ToL on those like me who don't want the skin.</div></div><hr />

I'd hate to think that druids would wear nothing BUT cloth just so they can get a bonus.<br />

Right now, it's like 10 of the bis items for casting druids happens to be cloth.<br />
But I'm sick of losing cloth gear to a druid, and then having leather gear go, without competition, to the same druid.<br />

Pretty sure also that these things are all based on what spec you have. So Resto and Balance Druids get the 5% int for wearing leather one, but wouldn't get a bonus for wearing only cloth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For PvE, I'd say http://www.wowtal.com/#k=Za1KlBHB.9q4.warrior would be a good spec. You don't particularly need 3/3 in Taste for Blood, as you'd only have an 11% chance of it not procing in the period of time it takes for the ability to get off cooldown. Also, Intensify Rage would not be much of a dps increase for Arms as they dont require Enrages to use their abilities like Fury does.</div></div><hr />

The penalty here for wearing 'incorrect' armour types is so massive that no-one would ever consider it. If blizzard is going to enforce armor restrictions in such a way, why not simply restrict each class to only their recommended armour type?<br />
I think a much better way to enforce item restrictions would be to give bonuses (or penalties) on a piece-by-piece basis, at such a rate that upgrading one tier to a different armour class would be only the most marginal of upgrades (imagine, you are wearing a 232 piece of leather, a 245 cloth piece drops - but after the penalty it is really as though you are upgrading to a 239 piece, or less). You should want to wear your armour class, but not be afraid to pick up some off-set pieces if your particular item never drops.</div></div><hr />

It's nice you haven't really been paying attention to the changes at all. Intellect is SP and Mana pool in Cataclysm. With the possible exception of SP on weapons (Last I checked they were still deciding about putting direct SP on weapons), it will be the only source of SP. SP won't be a stat on gear (except possibly weapons), enchants or gems. Ignore everything you know about stat stacking, it's all out the window in the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chains of Ice slows 60% over 8 sec, is easy to reapply and can be done on range, now that they have removed improved hamstring that I'm glad they did, I hope they will either make the Glyph increase the slow amount and reduce the duration, or they allow you to apply hamstring to targets in other ways.<br />
<br />
The 5 yard range and &quot;bad&quot; slow makes it inferior to most others even tho it's physical debuff.<br />
Piercing Howl should be less of a slow due to the fact it's AOE with longer reach.<br />
<br />
<br />
Could someone confirm if it's possible to get ticcs of from Blood Craze if it's refreshed frequently?</div></div><hr />

Given the ''said'' fact that mana management will be much more important in Cata than ever before, 5% intel bonus might be more than expected. Today healers have 30k+ mana in t10 gear, given at 85 we may have roughly 50k base mana, 5% is 2.5k more...seems small but is at least worth 2 more heals.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I like the DK blood tree, but the only option so far for me is to fill the tree. There's no room for me to splurge points for the replaced &quot;On a Pale Horse&quot;. Why they moved it to Frost is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait, what? Because of the change to SR? With the tweaking of spell costs because Enhancement runs on a base mana pool now and the introduction of Primal Wisdom (which you get even before SR), mana is hardly an issue. The dropping of Magma Totem/Fire Nova spam for a persistent Enhancement AoE is highly situational (the clunky mechanic of which is being discussed on the beta forums), considering that the Searing Flames/Lava Lash combo hits like two trucks taped together and outperforms plopping down Magma Totem/FireNova every 20 seconds. The only way SR is a &quot;nerf&quot; is that we can't eat dirt, Reincarn and then pop SR to gain mana back. Water Shield and haste affecting mana regen (at least there's talk of it affecting mana regen) should remedy that problem (as would not dying period, but that's what we get for having the lowest health pool in the game).<br />
<br />
Combined with the changes to Mental Quickness and the buff to Unleash Wind, Enhancement is looking pretty solid right now. Of course, that doesn't mean we're done yet, or even a perfect iteration of the spec. Our Masteries are a little ... eeeenhhh, there's that whole debacle over LB versus LvB (conditional macros here I come!), finding a sound rotation for alternating FS and ES, and there's still the lack of a really solid AoE. But other than that, our rotations are far less spastic and a GCD nightmare than they were in Wrath. We're not the three-button-wonders we were in BC, oh no, but Enhancement's rotation is now way more fun and way less of a &quot;christ I need Faceroller AND Power Auras to keep track of all this shit!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Most likely, they will be associated with your primary talent choice, the one which you're required to place atleast 31 points in order to access the other two.<br />
Does that make sense to you?<br />
Will work like all other &quot;role&quot; specific abilities they currently have made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's useless you say? Wow, now I know why almost no rets ever heal me in bg's. <br />
I'm guessing you ONLY pve, and ONLY want dps increasing talent, but also whine if you don't get any fun spells as well? (it can't be done btw, dps is boring end of:P)<br />
<br />
Selfless healer is amazing imo.<br />
Holy shield being exlusive with inq, means you can't use both at the same time. It means the OPPOSITE of what YOU think :P<br />
<br />
And yes, it doesn't remove stun anymore, and I'm guessin you know EVERYTHING about how pvp will be at cata. Even more so then the people who actually make the game? right....<br />
PVP WILL NOT BE THE SAME AS NOW. read that line 30 times in your hea before commenting again please.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">draconicman</div><div class="date">2010-07-24, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I'm confused... Since some classes have multiple armor specializations, do they get a cumulative bonus or does the bonus depend on the talent spec? For example, DKs have, Plate, Defenders, and Frozen. Is Plate for Unholy, Defenders for Blood, and Frozen for Frost... or... do they get the cumulative bonus of strength +10% and Stamina +5% (plate+defenders+frozen)? Please let me know if I need to explain further.<br />
<br />
I just looked on Wowhead and I saw another specialization, Dreamer's Leather Specialization, which gives +5% int. (Frozen Plate is there too but neither is listed here for some reason.) All this redundancy gives me the feeling that the armor specializations will be tied to the new talent system and that the different names are just for flavor.<br />
<br />
The Cloth Specialization has me a bit confused though. Assuming only the clothies would have that, it's the only armor type they would be wearing anyway, so why not just give them the 5% int boost outright? The programming doesn't need to be as complicated, and they can give it a much better name. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's been done mainly for consistency and balance rather than being easier to program. All classes get the same type of bonus based on the same conditions and therefore are being treated equally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason they can't do this is because <br />
a) this would screw with item level mechanics - they can't just arbitrarily increase the Int on some pieces without changing its iLevel.<br />
b) if they are already writing the (probably more complicated, given the 3 different types) code for Plate Specialisation, they may as well do a copy/paste for the cloth version, rather than coming up with some other, different, new version for clothies.<br />
<br />
That being said, I personally think the bonus is too large, and should be rewarded on a piece-by-piece basis rather than for the entire set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they have it the less complicated way already by just using the same &quot;armor specialization&quot; 5% method as the rest of the classes and specs.<br />

<br />
No, it's really good for us. It means Druids, and to a lesser extent paladins, will leave the cloth healing gear alone because they'll mostly want the leather set bonus. So it works out better for us.<br />
<br />
There was a big issue about some cloth being druids BIS, and their GM's were giving it to priest under cloth priority etc. Blizz said back then they wanted druids in leather or some form of sacrifice to take cloth which is when they started talking about these specialisations. It helps clothies more than anyone because we can't wear anything else so it was a bitch when druids wanted it.</div></div><hr />
