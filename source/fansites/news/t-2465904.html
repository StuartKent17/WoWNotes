Edit: Forgot how much people ride Blizz's dick with raiding and bosses. Next time ask Method for a reach around while you champion them. In case you forgot, Kil'Jaeden took far longer and had almost double the wipes to clear or did selective memory come into place?

I mean to be fair in an F1 race the leader can get all the advantages they want.<br />
<br />
Doesn't mean they will win the race. Can easily end up with a retirement on the final lap. And it has happened before. Spain 2001 where the leader retired on the final lap with engine failure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you kidding me? I turned in like 2 hours ago and they were at around 350 tries at that point. Like srsly, the most prepared guild (except maybe Limit) on this planed, who has multiple nearly perfect equipped characters for this challenge and who prepared for this the last 3 months needed OVER 350 tries to kill her.<br />
<br />
That does not show that the raid is too easy, that shows that Jaina is way overtuned.</div></div><hr />

Yeah Jaina was hard. They spent the whole week on her to be honest. The rest of the raid was maybe a tad too easy. Mekkatorque or Rastakhan should've been a bigger hurdle than they were.</div></div><hr />

So much ignorance, there were at least 23 guilds stuck at the last boss at one point. It also took them more than 300 tries... But I guess they just plowed through it amirite?</div></div><hr />

I mean what a world first guild can do compared to most other guilds is completely different.<br />

Not sure about the superiority, but Limit was salty before this race even started with faction changing to Alliance and made the guild &quot;This game is bad&quot;. And with gear and time advantage, they still can't land it. <br />
And people cheer for their teams in all sorts of activities, and many act cocky after, it's pretty normal.</div></div><hr />

That does not show that the raid is too easy, that shows that Jaina is way overtuned.<br />
<br />
1) even if Jaina is hard the rest of the raid can still be undertuned<br />
2) they killed her with a Zerg strat and one ID worth of loot, other guilds will have weeks of mythic loot in their bags by the time they get kill tries on her. If undergeared + Zerg strat = success, then there is a high chance that the encounter will be too easy when guilds get there with &quot;normal&quot; gear or better.</div></div><hr />

But people hated M Kil'jaedan. And they hated all the stacking, one screw up/DC wipe mechanics in ToS. <br />

<br />
Edit: Forgot how much people ride Blizz's dick with raiding and bosses. Next time ask Method for a reach around while you champion them. In case you forgot, Kil'Jaeden took far longer and had almost double the wipes to clear or did selective memory come into place? Hell, Avatar took even more attempts than she did sooooo......<br />
<br />
Kil'Jaeden was a huge mess of a boss, badly tuned and super bugged. You shouldn't use him as a reference.<br />
On the subject of Jaina, this tier was different because no &quot;gearcheck&quot; boss and azerite vendor+craft made it so that every single raider in Method's comp could have access to full 415 azerite gear, making ilvl far less of an issue.</div></div><hr />

I turned in like 2 hours ago and they were at around 350 tries at that point. Like srsly, the most prepared guild (except maybe Limit) on this planed, who has multiple nearly perfect equipped characters for this challenge and who prepared for this the last 3 months needed OVER 350 tries to kill her.<br />
<br />
That does not show that the raid is too easy, that shows that Jaina is way overtuned.<br />
<br />
I dunno, it's Mythic. It's meant to be the be-all end-all of raiding, right? If it takes the best person months and hundreds of tries, maybe that's the way it should be...? /shrug</div></div><hr />

2) they killed her with a Zerg strat and one ID worth of loot, other guilds will have weeks of mythic loot in their bags by the time they get kill tries on her. If undergeared + Zerg strat = success, then there is a high chance that the encounter will be too easy when guilds get there with &quot;normal&quot; gear or better.<br />
<br />
I agree that seeing a zerg strat successful on week 1 is a bit disappointing.<br />
Though as I said, I don't think a WF kill has been that close to &quot;fully geared&quot; since a very long time.<br />
They're 406.6 ilvl average, with everybody having 415 azerite armor.</div></div><hr />

The standard on here when I said that it seemed a tad too easy (undergeared and able to clear it in one reset) was that &quot;DEY TOOK 350 ATTEMPTS! IT WASN'T EASY!&quot; thus I noted that other raids took far longer with more attempts.<br />
<br />
Now I love that the reply is &quot;well people hated that fight.&quot; <br />

406.6 is still 8.4 ilvl below what the raid drops baseline, so there is plenty of room to grow. Scrubbusters, who I would imagine didn't go as excessively on BoEs and grinding, are 406.27 according to wowprogress.</div></div><hr />

Gratz to them, but I worry that this raid must have been too easy if they were able to plow through it like so.<br />
<br />
I'm not arguing about previous content, I'm arguing that this wasn't as easily as 'plowing through it'. But now you're backpedaling on that statement I guess?<br />
<br />
But just for the sake of it, Nighthold (7.1 vs 8.1) took 11 days total and 248 attempts to kill Gul'dan. Blackhand lived 10 days. Xavius died within the first day. The list goes on, there are way more bosses with attempts that were about the same or less than outliers like Kil'jaeden.

1.) What is you's? <br />

We can find examples all over WoW showing more or less time taken on bosses however, as the game grows it is suppose to develop more, this doesn't seem to be the case in this raid (though the same can be said for ALL of BfA as it's WoD level bad).<br />
<br />
I mean ffs they used a zerg strategy to kill her, that's literally plowing through the content and showing either bad development or tuning issues where they ignore mechanics to kill.</div></div><hr />

You's is an informal contraction for yours, you are, you is, the list goes on.<br />
<br />
We can find examples all over WoW, but it's clear that overall Jaina is harder than average. Blackhand and Gul'dan would be the most fair comparisons I think given they're the same raid tiers and recency, Jaina would place right at the middle. For all the shit that BfA gets and I personally give it too lol, this raid wasn't that bad. WoD raids weren't that bad either. It's just that the rest of the content sucked (and sucks), hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean ffs they used a zerg strategy to kill her, that's literally plowing through the content and showing either bad development or tuning issues where they ignore mechanics to kill.<br />
<br />
Zerging is not really uncommon on world first races though, considering they barely had enough gear to pull it through it may have been the only viable way to kill her right now. Cheese strategies is the bread and butter of world first races, a very old example that comes to mind would be Ragnaros back in Cata (way harder too, took 500+ wipes IIRC), where they used this trinket (https://www.wowhead.com/item=55879/sorrowsong&amp;bonus=4153) to zerg the last phase. It's nowhere near the first time it had happened and it also does not even correlates to actual boss difficulty, so it's a pretty weak point to base your argument on.</div></div><hr />

Its not about being a ''fanboy'' like you said its about bringing that race to another level<br />
The simple fact they stream and put effort on the ''professional'' event make it greater to follow than LIMIT and their twitter post<br />
There was more than 100k people looking at it<br />
players, raiders and even people not playing anymore<br />
WoW was top twitch streamed game for a while<br />

Edit: Forgot how much people ride Blizz's dick with raiding and bosses. Next time ask Method for a reach around while you champion them. In case you forgot, Kil'Jaeden took far longer and had almost double the wipes to clear or did selective memory come into place? Hell, Avatar took even more attempts than she did sooooo......<br />

i know that can be annoying that they keep referring it as a &quot;kill&quot; but that is just is called when a raid boss encounter is finshed.<br />

You are skipping the part where Limit took the time to trash on the game during faction change with the name of the alliance guild. The game that defines their life, and they still lose. I don't know, maybe that josh priest is indeed an asshole, I don't know him, but maybe, in this case, they did kind of deserve the trash talk.</div></div><hr />

So all in all it seems Jaina is tuned just right for an endboss (shame about the zerg strat, but can't blame Method on this one). It's really bosses 6, 7 and 8 that should have been harder to provide a longer race. Oh well, it was still a blast to follow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this even feasible?<br />
Depends on when MC will be opened. If it‚Äôs opened since day one, it won‚Äôt be that interesting, given everyone has to max chars and properly gear a little (we all know how long this was in Vanilla), with guilds being able to play 24/7 for the first months having the upper hand.<br />
<br />
BWL should be a little more interesting, if Blizzard gives guilds enough time to get full T1 (again, we all know how long this was in Vanilla).<br />
<br />
Most and first interesting races will probably be AQ and Naxx. Wonder how long will Classic survive after Naxx, it was not the kind of game that encouraged solo play and when even slower guilds will be full T4, there will not be much left to do.</div></div><hr />

It is only a tiny % that raid above LFR, the numbers who raid mythic+ are tiny. Dumb shit like transmog competitions get more views on twitch than people clearing mythic raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they only raided a few hours a day then sure one could argue its too easy but they raided or at the very least did something to contribute towards the kill ( m+, heroic splits etc ) 16 hours a day for almost a week, that amount of hours alone is more than what most people will spend in the raid over the span of a couple of months.</div></div><hr />

That does not show that the raid is too easy, that shows that Jaina is way overtuned.<br />

Not overtuned at all.<br />

They killed her with heroic gear. And a bit of mythic gear. In a month she'll be a joke to mythic guilds that deserve to be called &quot;mythic guilds&quot;</div></div><hr />

Ah, but since we're talking about selective memory, do you recall how many fixes were done ? Or when the Method said boss was mathematically impossible and only after another set of nerfs / fixes they said that basically all their wipes up to that point were useless and only now they can start proper tries?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Should it? If it takes the best person months (lets say even &quot;only&quot; three months, it means maybe 20 guilds get to clear the raid on Mythic. If that is your take on it...fair enough. I just don't see that ever becoming the philosophy in WoW. Maaaaybe something again where a raid wide buff happens after a certain time like with ICC.<br />

But I guess we will continue to see bosses die on mythic in a week...or two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't count the guilds that aren't shown on wowprogress. Nobody's been able to really clear up if they really have the exact same systems as the rest of us. I've seen all sort of theories around - that it's exactly the same, that it's not, that their bonus roll is 100% chance, that they don't even have bonus roll etc. I also have no clue when those guilds have their reset.<br />
In the end, I don't think there's a chance anymore that the win is contested - we'd have to see another kill in less than a day.</div></div><hr />

They killed her with heroic gear. And a bit of mythic gear. In a month she'll be a joke to mythic guilds that deserve to be called &quot;mythic guilds&quot;<br />
<br />
410 ilv(with a lot of perfect azerite gear) is not heroic level, Jaina is going to get nerfed in 1-2 months, the third phase is absurd even if the whole team had 5 more ilvs. It took the best players in the world to get perfect RNG and execution to get a kill, the last boss is not suppose to be tuned just for them but for the rest of the mythic guilds.</div></div><hr />

Not saying they should have plowed through it, but that it shows that they went through the content faster than previous raids content.<br />

<br />
none of that changes the fact that they bought the win with the race changes.<br />
<br />
you have zero end-boss kills in WoD. you cleared MoP's heroic (eventually mythic) tier's 8-12 months after their release. cata, almost 2 years after raid releases. WotlK, 3 years after release(so.. during cata).<br />
<br />
please explain to us more experienced raiders how buying race changes invalidates world first kills, because I'm a little confused. does that mean every guild can get world first if they just race change to the best race? what are the % differences between races in the 30-5 boss burn on Jaina? do you know whether or not Limit also required race changes (hint: the answer starts with a Y). if Limit did race change (hint: they did), then does that mean they forgot to check the &quot;World First Jaina Kill&quot; option when they proceeded to checkout?</div></div><hr />

I did in fact, but I don't think they deserved one back to be honest, because of my own opinion of josh. Plus if someone posts something snarky, posting something snarky back makes you look that much more ignorant, troubled and triggered by it. The logic of 'somebody posted or did something bad or I don't agree with so I'll do the same in response' is idiotic.</div></div><hr />
