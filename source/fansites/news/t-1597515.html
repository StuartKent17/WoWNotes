I'll have to check on the beta, but it could just mean that all DKs on your account get it or all pallies for the charger etc ...</div></div><hr />

It's, for instance, if you have multiple Paladins and you don't want to redo the argent quests. Still pally exclusive, but ALL your pallies can get it.</div></div><hr />

I'll check too. For Argent's mounts it may just mean available for all pallys. It would make sense, but DK mounts aren't they free ?<br />

<br />
I think it's probably because The Argent mount is obtainable by ALL Pally races, you just have to do those quests until you get it. I have one on my main paladin, but I have 3 other lvl 90 Paladins and having the Argent Charger on them is something I've always wanted just not badly enough to do the tournament quests again. The racial mounts are just that... racial mounts, Why would a Blood Knight ride a Sunwalker Kodo? Silly</div></div><hr />

Kotaku has a nice article on what they know about Titan.<br />
<br />
MMO set in the future on Earth after an alien invasion with a very large world<br />
Three factions trying to control the planet.<br />
Do less interesting professions during the day while secretly fighting alongside your faction if you choose to do so.<br />
Team Fortress, Starcraft II, and The Incredibles all named in comparisons.<br />
Player run businesses and shops, families, relationships with NPCs, advanced AI that made it feel more like a living world.<br />

That's interesting. I know the Horde and Alliance versions only count for them, but have no idea if Kodos and Elleks add to the Chargers of the other races in the same faction. If they do I'll race-change my abandoned Paladin to Belf (my first Belf).</div></div><hr />

I know it's Blizzard and 50 million isn't a /huge/ amount for them, but that is a lot of money to just throw out the window if it isn't based on passion. Whats your reason? If you're going to be smarmy, you need to actually make a point.</div></div><hr />

This part seems interesting. Though, most mmos set in the future or on earth, realistic art even, are bound to fail. Sadly.<br />
I hope they use this for future games tho. Also, this sounds like the game I was writing down ideas for at one point.<br />

But what about proving grounds ? did it will work like brawler (current achievements movin to legacy feat of strenght and come back at WoD with new ones) ?<br />
Yup proving grounds will be removed,placed into legacy as lvl 90 content,and in WoD you get new achieves for lvl 100.Same stuff rly in proving grounds,only the lvl changes.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they could put some of that into the MMO that they are already running rather than giving us the same crap over and over again.</div></div><hr />

:( to the nerf to savagery. I'll probably still get it cos I'm lazy though!</div></div><hr />

They just renamed the project and are starting over. Same people are on it. As for the hate for kotaku, you do realize it's a website with a bunch of different writers right? Of course not, cause that would take logical thought.</div></div><hr />

Shame on you. <br />
<br />
I'm really interested in Titan but I'm not going to visit that filthy site. I might get cancer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was curious so i google a little. Apparently these 3 sites had journalists blogging about how ridiculous mass effects fans was to complain and &quot;riot&quot; against Bioware, for making such a bad ending for mass effect 3.<br />
<br />
Titan sounds cool. Always like the idea of 3 factions, open up for many ruckus things to happen.</div></div><hr />

Besides that, it's just an explanation of what Titan was going to be. Calm down.<br />
<br />
Where did I say Jason was involved in that? Some people posted dubious articles, the owners of the website did everything in their power to protect said people. The website should be boycotted because of the owners and the bad journalists.<br />
<br />
And I'm pretty calm actually... Weirdo</div></div><hr />

Does that mean I can make a human Pala, get it a charger, then use it on my L90 Draenei Pala?<br />
<br />
I just checked the beta, you get the mount in your list on that faction but trying to use says something like 'Requires Human Paladin to use'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;what do you need today ma'am?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;press the &quot;1&quot; key to chop the meat as fast as possible!&quot;<br />
<br />
Who never dreamed about playing a game where you could own a butcher shop? No idea why cancel something with great ideas such as this!</div></div><hr />

&quot;WE HATE TEH X-BOX N TINK ITS OLD HEERS WHY NYA NYA NYA&quot; - Actual Kotaku article.<br />
<br />
Again, no one should ever respect anybody from Kotaku (even the guy behind Bayonetta hates them/Ploygon).</div></div><hr />

They're not cutting MoP features, they're renewing them for WoD.</div></div><hr />
