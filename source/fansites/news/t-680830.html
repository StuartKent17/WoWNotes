Player &quot;beats the game&quot; on Taiwanese Servers<br />
There was a few posts about it on the forums during the past week and I'll assume it's worth a front page news. On taiwanese servers, &#23567;&#28784; (http://tw.wowarmory.com/character-achievements.xml?r=Wrathbringer&amp;cn=%E5%B0%8F%E7%81%B0&amp;gn=%E7%A5%9E%E6%A8%A3) from the guild &#31070;&#27171; (http://tw.wowarmory.com/guild-info.xml?r=Wrathbringer&amp;gn=%E7%A5%9E%E6%A8%A3) (TW-Wrathbringer) succesfully completed all achievements in the game and is the first player to reach 986/986 achievements completed on the armory. <br />
<br />
Technically he's still missing BB King (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4437/bb-king/) (added with Patch 3.2.2) and his World Events achievements are down to 138/139 because of that, luckily a bug with an old PvP achievement gives him 165/164, that's how he got 986/986. The achievement count obviously doesn't take Feats of Strength into account because it's technically impossible to get all of them. (Well I guess you could race change to compete for the first level 80 undead/tauren/troll/orc/blood elf on the same character but I don't think you'll get all of them)<br />
<br />
I could have waited until he gets his last achievement to report it but Patch 3.3 will probably (=99% chance) be deployed on live servers before he has a chance to do it. It would be a shame to not talk about it just because of that, and if you ever wondered if it's possible to complete all the achievements in the game you have your answer now: yes you can, it's just going to take a lot of dedication. <br />

Regarding Purchasing WoW from Resellers<br />
We are beginning a special three-day sale of World of Warcraft on November 27 – 29, where the price of the original game will be only $5.00! Digital copies of the game, including an authentication key, will be available for purchase through our online store at this low rate as well. For more details on this special sale, please visit: http://us.blizzard.com/store/<br />
<br />
It’s possible that in some locations copies of the game which were purchased during this sale could be returned and be resold at full normal price. These resold copies may have already been used which would result in an invalidated authentication key unable to be used to create a World of Warcraft account. While we will try to prevent these situations, we recommend you purchase the game through the official Blizzard Online Store, or by ensuring you’re only purchasing an unused copy from a reputable brick-and-mortar retail location. <br />
<br />
<br />
Addon - Shadowed Unit Frames<br />
The last time I mentioned an add-on was ... a long time ago (Assuming that Quick Auctions (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/auction-house-guide-inscription/) doesn't count). I usually spend some time writing a small review of the addon but Shadowed has a nice description on WoWInterface (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info13494-ShadowedUnitFrames.html) and I'll assume he knows his addon better than I do, I'll just steal it. <br />
<br />
Shadowed Unit Frames on WoWInterface (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info13494-ShadowedUnitFrames.html)<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/november/suf1.jpg (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info13494-ShadowedUnitFrames.html) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/november/suf2.jpg (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info13494-ShadowedUnitFrames.html) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/november/suf3.jpg (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info13494-ShadowedUnitFrames.html)<br />
<br />
Description<br />
The main focus of SUF is having a simplistic configuration, while maintaining flexibility that the vast majority of users care about, this prevents unnecessary bloat that sacrifices performance. While you aren't going to be able to set that you want the health bar to be exactly 3.14 pixels outside of the health bar, you can change options that you actually care about such as bar height, ordering, frame height and so on. All configuration can be done on multiple units at the same time through the global configuration, meaning if you want to set the height of Player and Target frames to 50, but then you want to set the height of Target's Target and Target's Target of Target to 30 you can easily do that with changing only two options, instead of having to do it four times for each unit.<br />
<br />
Should you be one of those people who needs a little bit of extra configuration then do not despair! An advanced configuration option is included that will enable more unit and general settings giving you better control over everything<br />
<br />
Slash commands: /shadoweduf (/suf)<br />
<br />
Anchoring<br />
For those who are driven crazy because their frames look to be half a pixel off center of your player frames, you can simply anchor the frame to the player frames and solve the hassle of aligning everything. For example, the target frames are anchored to the right of the player frame, and the Target of Target frames are anchored to the top of the player frames (In the screenshots).<br />
<br />
If you tried to drag player, all the other frames will follow it in the same anchoring. Each frame can still be manually positioned and put wherever you want, but this gives you a way of easily anchoring everything and keeping frames nice and aligned without having to use a ruler.<br />
<br />
Visibility<br />
Entire units and modules can be enabled or disabled based on zone type; for example, say you want to enable party targets while in arenas but not in a raid instance, or maybe you want to see your targets cast bar in arenas but not in raid instances you can easily change the module to only be enabled in arena zone types. You don't have to swap any profiles or do anything manually.<br />
<br />
Units<br />
Supports unit frames are as follows:<br />
<br />
Player: Player, pet, pet target<br />
General: Target, Target of Target, Target of Target of Target, Focus, Focus Target<br />
Party: Party, Party pets, Party targets<br />
Raid: Raid, Main tank, Main tank target, Main assist, Main assist target<br />
Arenas: With the arena frame (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info13696-ShadowedUFArenas.html) module you can add Arena, Arena target, Arena pet units<br />
<br />
Features<br />
Tags: Includes a simple tagging system that can be customized in virtually any way using Lua, so even if something isn't included by default odds are you can make the tags<br />
Incoming heals: Supports LibHealComm-4.0 for incoming heal data which gives you more accurate information including heal over times and channels like Tranquility and Penance<br />
Auras: Can be set to only show auras you casted, or can cast on others. Can enlarge auras that you casted, and hide the cooldown ring on the timers of auras you didn't cast as well to make it more obvious which ones you casted and which ones you didn't<br />
Aura timers: You will need a mod such as OmniCC to show timers on buffs and debuffs<br />
Fader: Fades frames when out of combat and inactive (100% mana/no target)<br />
Druid power/rune/totem bars: Supports simple rune and totem bars as well as Druid mana bars for the player frame<br />
Highlighting: Can highlight frames off of mouseover, debuffs you can cure, aggro, target and focus<br />
Range checking: Fades frames out that are out of range of you<br />
Exportable layouts: If you have a layout, or your friend has a layout you want to try out you can export/import SUF layouts by going to /suf -&gt; Layout Manager<br />
Profiles: You can change from any profile to another one without reloading your UI, should you want to use a completely different layout based on zone you can easily switch profiles without hassle<br />
<br />
Pretty much all the general unit frame settings are in, health bars, cast bars, power bars, portraits, indicators and so on.<br />
<br />
Modules<br />
Basic module support is included, should you be interested in building a module see the documentation on github (http://wiki.github.com/Shadowed/ShadowedUnitFrames) for more information.<br />

<br />
As for the unitframes... how is SUF any different to Stuf Unitframes, Pitbull of any other decent unitframes addon? They all offer the same functionality and customisation as each other.<br />
<br />
Why do so many addon authors pump out regurgitated ideas (apart from reviving discontinued addons of course).<br />

This portion of this news item seems like a shameless and unnecessary plug. I wouldn't call SUF newsworthy. It's certainly not unique.</div></div><hr />

Ensidia got Immortality - where no body dies at all during all the encounters in ToGC 25.<br />
<br />
This guy just got Insanity, which means people died during boss fights but each boss was one-shotted - this was done first by them on the realm, hence the feat of strength as well.</div></div><hr />

In regards to SuF, I got sick of Pitbull about 6 months ago and hunted curse for some alternatives. SUF was the one I chose and I was very happy with it. Great balance between features and simplicity of setup which pitbill really failed at.<br />
<br />
I used sraidframes for the raid frames though as it was more convenient and minimalist, plus looked good.</div></div><hr />

I'm wondering this myself. I mean, all the unit frame addons seem the same to me. I have Xperl set up the way I like it, so what is the motivation for downloading a new unit frame and spending the time (usually an hour or two) getting it set up just right?<br />
<br />
If there are genuine reasons for using it, I'm all in. I just don't really see the differences between the different unit frames, other than minor graphical tweaks between each one.</div></div><hr />

If what you are using works fine for you then there is no reason to change. I switched because I was sick of the frames I was using. Different strokes for different folks.</div></div><hr />

Digital copies of the game, including an authentication key, will be available for purchase through our online store at this low rate as well. For more details on this special sale, please visit: http://us.blizzard.com/store/<br />
<br />
It’s possible that in some locations copies of the game which were purchased during this sale could be returned and be resold at full normal price. These resold copies may have already been used which would result in an invalidated authentication key unable to be used to create a World of Warcraft account. While we will try to prevent these situations, we recommend you purchase the game through the official Blizzard Online Store, or by ensuring you’re only purchasing an unused copy from a reputable brick-and-mortar retail location. <br />

<br />
http://i181.photobucket.com/albums/x63/peeweesweden/WoWScrnShot_112709_141400.png<br />
<br />
I switched to reduce my memory print, and managed to do so. Also, I switched from FuBar to LDB-based addons, and while I get more information available than before, I reduced the memory usage by ~20MB. <br />
<br />
Pitbull 4.0 unitframes also snap to each other, and you can manage several frames at the same time by doing the options for a &quot;frame type&quot; and have several types of frames linked to it. <br />
<br />
As for fading frames, I simply enabled it and use the default settings. <br />
<br />
In my screenshot, Me and Target use the same &quot;type&quot;. Changing settings on one changes the other as well, and then I have marked &quot;Mirrored&quot; for Target. My Pet and ToT also share the same type, with ToT mirrored. <br />
<br />
Naturally, Pitbull supports ToT, ToToT, FocusTarget, FocusToT as well. <br />

I have this mod and yes, it's almost exactly like ag_unitframes. There was a several month period where ag wasn't updated and was getting buggy, that is when I picked up this guy. It's almost the exact same functionality, so I never switched back. I've tried just about every other Unit Frame add-on and almost all of them were distracting in some way. I like my UF simple and this add-on definitely provides that.</div></div><hr />

Game has been out for 5 years, roughly. 1825 days. 612 total days played is roughly one third of that. Which means you've spent one third of every day, seven days a week, playing wow (that's 8 hours).<br />

...really? Even assuming weekend binges of 13 hours every Saturday and Sunday, it still means 6 hours on each weekday. Every day. For five years.</div></div><hr />

Can I add specified debuffs to display as I work through ICC?

<br />
I somewhat doubt he did all of them on his own, and had some help getting boosted in arena at the very least.<br />
The raid achievements are a definite hats off as well, not to mention the ridiculous grind to get all 4-5 of the battlegrounds : Win 100x achievements.. I seriously stopped at 4-5 wins. It's just not worth the effort.<br />

i'm asking you this without any &quot;lolz get a life dude&quot; attidude, but seriously how do you manage to play 6 to 10 hours of WoW EVERY BLOODY DAY? i mean okay. i guess we all had days, mostley weekends as far as i'm concerned, where we played 6 of more hours of WoW. <br />
<br />
but honestly: don't you have better things to do? meat with friends? go to bars and get wasted (okay, maybe that one's not so good) or something else, you get the idea!<br />

Theres probably some omg taking shit loads of time achievments but this doesnt mean he has no life at all..<br />

Yeah but those people get paid to play. I think that I would be a lot better at getting achievements if I was getting paid to play the game as well.</div></div><hr />

He earns his achievements on his own. Also, Taiwanese is not equal to Chinese, Twow is different from Cwow.<br />
<br />
He can get all achievements because he only play one character, where he is RL and has good raid group/arena team.<br />
<br />
That's all. He is a programmer in real life.<br />

<br />
His friends play with him ? <br />
He finds it more entertaining to play wow than get drunk ?<br />
He works wile playing wow (programmer) ?<br />
<br />
and he was probably just insanily dedicated at one point when the achievements came out and had a head advantage on everyone then decided to just finish them.</div></div><hr />

In other news, this game is so damn addictive, I decided to quit for the 7th time... but this time is for real since I deleted ALL my toons, cancelled my account and uninstalled the game, is just taking way too much time out of my real life...not having a girlfriend for the past 3 years,gaining around 50 lbs and prefering to raid instead of going out with friends kinda tells you what I have become, but I hope I go back to my old self =)<br />

I'm not saying the Chinesse guy is wrong, cool he can do that, maybe he has all the time in the whole world and he is married, and somehow he gets paid to play WOW (there is people who does I beleive) and I'm impressed, specially with the pvp achivements wich I always thought they were way more difficult and time comsuming than pve (in my opinion) , gratz guy, 10 thumbs up!</div></div><hr />

<br />
These realm firsts are definitely true.<br />
<br />
The TW realms launched with Wotlk at around noon on November 18, 2008. It took &#23567;&#28784; around 31~35 hours (it's been a year so I can't remember very clearly) to reach level 80 and became the third level-80 player in TW region. With top-notched sunwell gears, he leveled faster than most players and was able to solo most elite quests. If he could not solo those quests, he grouped with another sunwell-gear Paladin (second level-80 player in TW region and first in TW-Wrathbringer, Seraphshymn) and beat them all.<br />
<br />
It's definitely not hard to get 200 Frostweaves in 31 hours, most mobs in Northrend are undead and humanoids. The heavy frostweave bandage manual is a world drop after your first-aid reaches 390, it's not that hard to get one in some 20 hours even with mediocre luck.<br />
<br />
Cooking is another story, he stored most chilled meat looted throughout his leveling. He also earnt three cooking awards while leveling(cooking dailies require only level 65.) and the rest is history. :p Since he was waiting for other guildies leveling to 80, he could had a plenty of time on cooking.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peeweesweden</div><div class="date">2009-11-28, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting cooking from 425 to 450 requires Northern Spices, which he definitely did not get 30+ in three days on his own. Doesn't take much to see this was not a personal feat, but a guild one. <br />
<br />
It's been said several times here that this is his only toon, so he didn't mail stuff from his alts. <br />

For class colored bars go under &quot;Units&quot;, select a unit you want to modify e.g. Player then go to Bars and it's in the top most drop down menu. <br />
<br />
Units &gt; Player &gt; Bars &gt; Color health by<br />
<br />
Do the same for Party/Targets and whatever you like. <br />
<br />
Or you can do them all at once, by going to Global and selecting all the frames you want to change then doing just exactly the same as above. <br />
<br />
Those a pretty powerful Unit Frames, a lot of things can be done, which just browsing through options. Just take your time with them and you'll get a nice setup in the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I agree. I previously was a big fan of Nurfed. Nurfed has went to shit since Apoco took over, and I was banned from the Nurfed forums for saying so. While some would agree with it, the thing is..Apoco even said the exact same thing himself. What an idiot.<br />
<br />
Anyways..SUF is an awesome addon. Even the raid frames reek of awesomeness, and I must say are better than Grid! I just happened to remove Grid last night as I was such a fan of it I never bothered to try SUF's raid frames, but after seeing them here (Thanks, Boub: You once again prove why MMO-Champion is THE best WoW site around, hands-down), Grid is now removed and I use SUF Raid. They provide the same, if not more, functionality than Grid, as well as looking BADASS just like SUF. I was running at an average of 5 FPS more or so last night in TOGC. While that's not a big deal, it is a slight improvement.</div></div><hr />

He had time to do three cooking dailies, and cooking daily bags have always had a chance to award you an extra cooking token. If he did the rhino dog daily as well, then he got two out of that and possibly another two in his bag.</div></div><hr />

Regarding this post and the previous for the frostweave cloth... ever hear of a little thing called an AUCTION HOUSE? People like me that didnt care for realm first for these things made a fortune on the AH because of people that wanted to try for it.<br />
<br />
Anyway... regarding Blizzard's deal. Seems to me like a really terrible offer.<br />
<br />
Ordering separately:<br />
Vanilla WoW - $5<br />
TBC - $29.99<br />
WotLK - $39.99<br />
<br />
OR:<br />
Vanilla + TBC + guides for both (WoW battle chest) - $19.99<br />
WotLK - $39.99<br />
<br />
So you save $15 and get more for buying the battle chest instead?</div></div><hr />

Taiwan is not apart of China just because China says it is, other countries won't recognize it for political reasons which has nothing to do with Taiwan's sovereignty, the US obviously doesn't want to upset it's banker.

Taiwan is part of China, whether it is political reasons or not, it is THE FACT. Anyone who doesnt admit the fact are morons. Taiwan is/was the part of China, just because it was governed by Japan and declared independence by KMT doesnt/didnt mean it doesnt belong to China. Again, KMT was from China, they espcaped to Taiwan in 1949 because they hope to retake China one day, which will never happen ofc. A loser party claimed independence, which is not admitted in China. Taiwan develops so well now, do you even know why? &quot;When the KMT government fled to Taiwan it brought the entire gold reserve and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China to the island which stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.&quot; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan#Political_status) You say you dont need a Chinese visa to enter Taiwan, well, do you need a Chinese visa to enter Hong Kong(part of China)? Americans can stay in HK for 3 months without visa, fyi.</div></div><hr />

the first charactor can be pronounced like &quot;Shaw&quot;, and the second is hard to describe in English&#65292;maybe “hrey[hrei]”.And the meaning of &quot;&#23567;&#28784;&quot; is “a little grey”&#65288;In Chinese&#65292;if you are on good terms with someone;moreover,he/she is younger than you,you can call him/her &quot;&#23567;+his/her first name&quot;.

But, the player does not in fact have all achievements, as he is missing three. Conq of Naxx, Obsidian Slayer and The Magic Seeker. So in my eyes it is impossible for him to even get every achievement, since those are indeed achievements, all be it rare ones that are unobtainable. The only way I see someone as having all achievements is if they have all of the server first ones as well, since they are achievements, they are just rare and extremely hard to get.</div></div><hr />

But, the player does not in fact have all achievements, as he is missing three. Conq of Naxx, Obsidian Slayer and The Magic Seeker.

You can't get _all_ achievements, since you can't have more than one pvp rank and one race/class first 80. If you need to have _all_, with just first 80 on server + race + class + pvp rank, you would also need all gladiator titles, and all obtainable FoS mounts. There will never be anyone with _all_ achievements, unless there is someone out there with all possible server firsts, brewfest steins, gladiator titles, and Atiesh if he/she is a mage/druid/lock/priest.</div></div><hr />

He said &quot;But, the player does not in fact have all achievements, as he is missing three. Conq of Naxx, Obsidian Slayer and The Magic Seeker&quot;. I think that Aikeiko meant he is missing those three achievements, and not all the other crap you listed. Hell, Feats of Strength don't even count towards your achievement count, so it doesn't matter if he's missing them or not.</div></div><hr />
