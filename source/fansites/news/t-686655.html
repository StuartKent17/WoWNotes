Welcome to 2010! If everything goes well it should be one of the most interesting year in the history of World of Warcraft. Everything will probably happen very fast in the next days, the end of the arena season should be announced very soon, followed by a minor patch in a few weeks (including the Lich King cinematic (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/patch-3-3-cutscene-blue-posts/) revealing the end of the WotLK storyline), and possibly new features on the armory (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/shadowfrost-shard-armory-updates-blue-posts/). A few weeks later we will probably see the Alpha/Beta of Cataclysm and things will get really interesting!<br />
<br />
It will be MMO-Champion 3rd birthday in March, I don't have any plan to stop spamming you with WoW news and hopefully you'll keep reading the site in 2010. Happy new year! <br />

Blue posts<br />
Itemization in Cataclysm<br />
Just a couple of things I want to touch on for this subject:<br />
We do want to and try to use all available stats for gear. If every Elemental piece was haste and crit, then every piece would look the same and get very boring.<br />
We feel it is okay for certain stats to be more valuable than others, but on the class side things have gotten too lopsided, usually because of over-generous talents that convert stats or give e.g. too much haste. No stat should ever be worth twice the value of another. We are aware of these issues and this is a big part of the talent tree redo we have planned for Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, combat ratings are too high right now. This is partly because of the above but also because item levels ended up being higher than we initially designed in order to embrace the heroic model we started using in Ulduar and in all the raid dungeon since then. Players should not ideally be worried about hitting the haste and crit caps ever, and certainly not at the very beginning of Icecrown Citadel. In return, the ratings in Cataclysm should be much harder to cap. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22048399218-elemental-4pc-t10-is-not-worth-getting-.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking 5-man without defense in Cataclysm<br />
Without a defense stat there should not be a huge gear requirement to tank 5-player dungeons. It would be ideal if say an Arms warrior could go Defensive Stance, maybe use a shield, and be able to fill the tank role in any normal dungeon or even the easier heroics.<br />
<br />
You will still likely need a Prot-spec warrior (or the equivalent of other classes) to MT actual raids. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/22048470286-lfg--cat.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking in WotLK<br />
I think what you're trying to say here is that tanking is too hard in LK? If so, I'd beg to differ, at least compared to BC. Just off the top of my head: Mobs are rarely taunt or CC immune now. All tanks have a ranged taunt and a ranged pull. All tanks have AE tanking potential. Tanking trees have a lot more utility and fewer passive survivability or threat talents. Etc.<br />
<br />
We did add DKs to make it easier to find tanks, and it has. We also added Dungeon Finder to make it easier to assemble groups, and it has. Neither of those designs guaranteed you could find a tank within 30 sec, and really nobody expected them to.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, tanking is a lot of work. Tanks are generally called upon to lead groups, set the pace of run, and keep things organized. Even a healer by contrast can kind of go along for the ride, healing here and there without really understanding the encounter mechanics. (I'm talking the 5-player Dungeon Finder experience here.) If there's a wipe, it's often blamed on the tank. If the dps pull aggro, it's often blamed on the tank. It takes a certain kind of player to want to tank, and really we're not trying to change that. We just want to do what we can to keep you from having to sit around too long waiting for a tank, up to and including you deciding to tank the run yourself. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/22048470286-lfg--cat.html))<br />
<br />
Icecrown Items Procs / Trinkets / Nibelung<br />
One thing we would like to do is make it so the procs/val'kyr do not miss bosses. We agree that it can be pretty frustrating to have something like this when there is no way around it. Unfortunately we don't have an estimate on when this could be implemented. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22049841555-nibelung-why-it-should-be-reevaluated.html))<br />
<br />
Healer Column of the WoW Magazine Preview<br />
Our intent isn't to discourage the use of add-ons. Our intent is to allow players who don't want to use add-ons to be able to get by without. The advances we made to the default UI with things like Equipment Manager and the new Quest Map are with that direction in mind. Some players just like add-ons or are very particular about specific functionality. That's cool. They can continue to use what they enjoy.<br />
<br />
I've healed a lot with and without Grid and similar mods. The default raid UI is adequate for healing, but only adequate. This is definitely a chunk of the UI that we'd next like to improve. Being able to show both buffs and debuffs at the same time feels like a necessity. Some healers will continue to want to use additional mods and that's their prerogative.

Bug - Elemental 2pc T10 Bonus puts the skill on a 7 day cooldown<br />
We believe this bug only happens in cross-server instances, which is probably why we didn't catch it. While it's certainly not excusable to not be able to use the set bonus when using Dungeon Finder, it shouldn't affect raiding.<br />
<br />
There have been a few similar bugs, such as the hunter ability Call Stabled Pet.<br />
<br />
We're working on a fix. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22049521897--elemental-2pc-t10-bonus-badly-bugged-.html))<br />

Fury / Arms tanking in 5-man<br />
We expect Prot to still be the talent tree of choice for raiding and the more challenging heroic dungeons since the talents will still probably make them a safer tank overall.<br />
<br />
However, making it easier for an Arms or Fury warrior (or Ret paladin, cat druid or dps-focused DK) to step in and tank accomplishes two good things:<br />
<br />
1) It makes it easier to get tanks for Dungeon Finder since some dps specs may be willing to slap on the shield (or change forms, etc.) for a faster queue. Based on the current use we are expecting players to use Dungeon Finder a lot in Cataclysm, even in the level up experience.<br />
<br />
2) It allows the tanking classes to more fully embrace the fact that they are designed as a hybrid class and they have options available if they are willing to step in and do the tanking.<br />
<br />
We're sensitive to Prot warriors not wanting to lose their jobs to non-tanks, but we don't really think that will happen. Right now the main thing keeping Arms warriors from tanking 5-player dungeons is having to get a complete second set of gear where they have to be crit immune. Getting a shield by itself shouldn't be nearly as big of a burden. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/22048401082-arms-tanking-in-cataclysm.html))</div></div><hr />

Yes. Let's keep gearscore, let's keep having to use add-ons and spreadsheets to see what's a minimal upgrade and what is not and heaven forbid we provide the same amount of stamina/hp amongst all armour profincies.<br />

And clearly AP isn't causing any problems in PvP balance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2010-01-01, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dual Spec kinda kills every effort they want to do to make tanking classes that were DPS specced to tank 5-mans. Not only these new attempts... but the ones before they even considered adding the dual spec to the game (specific tank tree skills changed to base class skills and others, DKs beeing able to tank and dps with all 3 trees and even with DPS oriented specs, etc.).<br />
<br />
No need to change things to let &quot;arms warriors tank&quot;. Just let people use dual-spec. If they want to be more &quot;effective&quot;, give people the option of a 3rd spec, like &quot;pvp spec&quot; that can only be active in Arenas/BGs, so those &quot;tanking capable classes&quot; can use their dual spec for pve dps and tank.<br />
<br />
And please, make things more coherent between 5-mans and raids... if the 5 man is in &quot;Heroic&quot; mode, let it be hard like it is suposed to be the heroic raid mode. Kinda lame that the &quot;heroic setting&quot; doesn't mean the same thing for 5man and raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You want to know how you can improve itemization in Cataclysm?<br />
<br />
LEAVE IT THE FUCK ALONE!<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets just start here an average doomkin is going to be haste+crit soft capped from talent procs. An average mage is going to have atleast 80+% crit. Mut rogues are crit capped and forced to stack hit again the list goes on and on. This was never the intent since ICC item lvl should be around the 250 not 277 and if you do not change something then every class is going to be haste, crit, and hit capped in greens. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically what this is saying is that getting heroic gear as rewards for doing hard modes is what is making the next raid instance immensely easy for good guilds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nobody except new players to the game will think the complete and utter removal of crowd control needed in an instance was a good idea.<br />
<br />
The whole &quot;gather them up&quot; and AoE is a skillless procedure that WotLK introduced. If you want to show your skills, you better learn some cc and being able to dps what your tank tells you to.<br />
<br />
<br />
To the first point please read the thread and not just 3 words from the blue post and make a conclusion. The ONLY conclusion you can draw from the post about hard modes is that originaly wolk was planned with the intention of having itemlvl go up by about 13 each time:<br />
<br />
Hc: 200<br />
Naxx: 213<br />
Ulduar: 226<br />
3.2: 239<br />
ICC: 252<br />
<br />
But since that was changed people have alot higher haste/crit/hit values, this has NOTHING to do with difficulty at all. If you hit for 5 and the boss has 50hp and changing that to hitting for 6 with a 60 hp boss is not going to change anything. Everything is not a fucking casual vs hardcore debate and stop trying to make it that. This is just a post pointing out that they did never intend any class to be crit/haste capped by procs alone. <br />
<br />
<br />
The 2nd thing about cc vs aoe then please stop using idiotic statments like &quot;nobody except new players&quot;. I have been playing since early vanilla and I happen to like the faster heroics. I grinded exalted with every hc dungeon in tbc often using hours in blood furnace hc, slab hc or crypts and it was all very fun but given the choice I would prefer the new faster less setup dependant hc. I know tons of players that liked the old hc but I know alot more that like the new faster ones. <br />
<br />
People please if you have an oppinion about something then share it but stick the the fucking subject and do not try to drag something else into a statement made by a blue to prove your point.</div></div><hr />

I am usually prot/ret but I heal for pvp, and there are countless times I have said &quot;sorry, I have my holy spec atm.&quot; <br />
<br />
I am willing to bet that nearly all people capable of tanking would if allowed a third spec. A high gold cost, plus the pain in the ass of collecting gear for 3 specs makes this not OP and helps everyone get gear.<br />

Then again there are those Ret Paladins, Wars and DKs, with dual spec both being dps, but I think even those baddies will be minimized if allowed a third spec.</div></div><hr />

Tanks are generally called upon to lead groups, set the pace of run, and keep things organized. Even a healer by contrast can kind of go along for the ride, healing here and there without really understanding the encounter mechanics. (I'm talking the 5-player Dungeon Finder experience here.) If there's a wipe, it's often blamed on the tank. If the dps pull aggro, it's often blamed on the tank. It takes a certain kind of player to want to tank, and really we're not trying to change that.

I just hope that it doesn't turn into some Death Knight tanks today, showing up in a dungeon finder with just a few pieces of resilience gear and some level 75 of the sperm whale gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, this isn't all that bad since they are removing crit immune caps, and fixing the classes for cataclysm, look at the benefits from this, if they added some more defensive benefits to arms for example, it would give them a greater advantage in pvp (without taking into account the rest of the changes of course.)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stonhinge</div><div class="date">2010-01-01, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing they're trying to do with defense is make it so that you don't have to keep that second set of gear around in order to tank something. If it's as little as just tossing on sword 'n' board and switching to defensive stance, a DPS warrior can make a great &quot;emergency tank&quot; - and doesn't have to worry about getting crit. Same for the rest, although it would hurt a paladin the most, given that most of their threat generating moves come from the prot tree.<br />
<br />
While they're not intending for DPS to just be able to change stance and tank raids, it gives more options for dungeons - especially leveling up - and heroics. Lots of DPS out there don't tank - or can't - because they don't have crit immune gear. This change would allow them to tank if they wanted, without having to form up a complete extra set of gear. As a person with a warrior, paladin and death knight - all with DPS and tanking specs - I will greatly appreciate not having to carry around an extra full set of gear.<br />
<br />
Sure, there's still going to be tanking pieces and DPS pieces of gear. But as a fresh 85, and the dungeon finder, the best way to get geared up for the initial raid is going to be to tank. Any tank who's queued up in the dungeon finder knows - you get a group right away. I don't see that changing anytime soon.<br />
<br />
They're not saying an arms warrior will necessarily tank in arms spec - just that he won't need an extra whole set of gear. Although it would depend on what they do to the talent trees.<br />
<br />
Besides, a fury tank is more fun. 2H weapon and shield. :)</div></div><hr />

You actually don't need mods to tank effectively. I use them, because I'm accustomed to them, but that's really just for the convenience of, say, having my character and target windows in a better location than the upper-right corner of my screen. I can't imagine any mods that would actually be required for tanking. Even Omen isn't these days, with the built in threat meter.</div></div><hr />

Why would i want to see a Arms warrior that go in defence mode and put on his shield.....<br />
If we got duel-spec....... ???<br />
<br />
<br />
Because it's awfully convenient when a feral druid presses his bear mode button to start tanking. So why not a arms warrior going defensive stance? I've seen plenty of warriors/dks pop their tank modes when the tank gets gibbed somehow and try to prevent a wipe. Just like how tank DPS was upped to not be so abysmmal (but still below real DPS), I rather like the idea that the tanking capability of a plate DPS spec is not so poor either... and enough to tank 5-mans. <br />
<br />
People have waaay too high standards for tanking and I've seen people who WANT to tank only to have some snotty rogue tell him he doesn't have 50k health to tank his nexus run. How can we more tanks when this is the kind attitude people have with fresh tanks? Seems you can't gear up a fresh tank unless you get twinked by your guild or was lucky to hit 80 quickly enough at release. Did you know we had 20k HP tanks tanking our heroics while the rest of you were still leveling? That's right. Both ways too. <br />

Yeah I agree. CC mostly served to slow things down. I hate having to sit there waiting for the leader to mark all the targets and make sure nobody breaks CC and makes sure their target stays CCed. CC can still be relevant, just leave it in PvP and some parts of raids (bosses, maybe some trash pulls).<br />
<br />
They'd also have to give just about every DPS class a CC spell to make it balanced. If CC was required, it wouldn't matter if your shadow priest or moonkin druid can do equal DPS. Seems easy to give all DPS specs a sheep spell, but Blizzard has this hate for CC when it comes to PvP and they'd rather not introduce more of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said they're removing defense stat on gear and giving tank more utility to increase their avoidance. Shields wont block all the damage anymore so fury and arms will probably go down rather quick in hard dungeons and raids. In that blue post there is another clearly stating that tanks and dps wont need 2 sets of gear to do either. So the only things needed utility, a tank weapon and a shield.<br />
<br />
About crit they have stated that they will make it so crit is a rare occurrence again so you will probably see having lots of crit having less worth over other stats.<br />

They not going do anything major to hit so you may still need to juggle around hit.</div></div><hr />

What the hell is wrong with you people?<br />
<br />
Without the defence requirement a dps spec plate user can chuck on a full tank set and have enough dodge, parry, health et al to survive. A prot specced plate user will have all the gear requirements, plus the addition of an entire talent tree to make them a better tank. Prots will still be the tank spec. Why are people worried that all of a sudden tank specs aren't going to exist.<br />
<br />
You can dps as a Frost Mage, or a BM Hunter, but you'll do more dps as Arcane and MM. You can tank as Arms, but you'll be a better tank if you're prot. As a concept it's not that hard to understand.<br />
<br />
The idea is to bring down queue times in lfg heroics, because being a tank can be a thankless task. I think it's a safe assumption that Arms/Fury warriors won't be tanking end game Cataclysm content.</div></div><hr />

But crit immunity will come from talents instead.<br />

It's pretty safe to assume those talents will be in the prot tree.<br />

i really like the style where there are like 3 or 4 High hp adds which you must dps down one at a time coz aoe would run you oom, also they could increase the mana costs of aoe so that pple cannot just sit there and spam it for a long time to kill adds.I think that would help</div></div><hr />

Then why are you, and other &quot;retards&quot; like you still hanging around here? If you don't like the game, there's a simple solution:<br />
<br />
QUIT!<br />
<br />
And if you already quit the game, then stay the f--k out of the World of Warcraft forums. And let the rest of us who actually enjoy the game, discuss the game and it's upcoming changes without retards such as yourself coming around here and causing trouble.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LEAVE IT THE FUCK ALONE!<br />
<br />
<br />
As a retribution paladin you can not possibly enjoy the state of things right now in itemization unless you actually like taking that agility neck/ring/cloak because Blizzard forgot to design items with strength on them. What part of &quot;changing item stats makes it easier to design gear&quot; do you honestly not get? Do you honestly believe Blizzard is streamlining gear primarily for the players? Nothing could be further from the truth. They are streamlining gear to speed up the development process and itemization process. Rather the players are happy with it or not (which most are) is a complete side effect.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2010-01-03, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">except new players to the game will think the complete and utter removal of crowd control needed in an instance was a good idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been playing since beta and I absolutely believe it was a great idea. Something was wrong when WAR was marketing its game based on the fact that WoW was really World of Crowd Control and almost everyone was agreeing. The average person has no real place to say anything, but ask that mage that has played since beta rather they enjoy just getting to dps now or if they want to trade back 500 dps so they can sheep stuff again in normal instance pulls. I think you know what answer any rational player will give you. CC always sucked. Not having to CC in heorics is fair, and in most cases you won't survive major pulls in raids without CC.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The whole &quot;gather them up&quot; and AoE is a skillless procedure that WotLK introduced. If you want to show your skills, you better learn some cc and being able to dps what your tank tells you to.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, it was a concept that most popular games used way before WoW even existed, and its a concept that most people enjoy. Apparently you never played a mage or one of the classes that simply couldn't heroic because of no CC. Something was wrong when for a heroic MgT, before the nerfs, you made a group with 3 mages 1 tank and 1 healer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BACK TO TBC STYLE - I ALSO LOVE THAT ;D<br />
<br />
<br />
About the only people I can see actually wanting that back that are scrub mages that can't get into group because of their dps that want to be carried again because they can sheep stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Trust me, master + ancient glyphs will mean much more work in optimising your character than the current stat based system.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not really. From what they have shown so far its looking very much like there is a PVP tree, a healing tree, a dps tree and a tanking tree. The other ones will all be hybrids of that concept such as a healing/dps tree. Now, anyone that is serious about raiding will take the dps, healer, tanking tree for their role and anyone that is serious about pvp will take the pvp tree. Its a very simple concept.</div></div><hr />

Where do you get the idea that he believes it will go into beta in January seeing that is not what he said at all. He said it will go into beta after they release the last part of ICC which is in Feb/March.</div></div><hr />

TBC was perfectly fine, hardcore enough for those who wanted (SWP) and softcore enough for the lesser gods so they got their Vashj Kill in june 2008. In before the Vanilla whiners; no Vanilla was grindfest! no fun in grinding!<br />
<br />
I really wonder how they make up and say that stats like defense / armor penetration etc. are too confusing? There's tons of information about every stat...</div></div><hr />

It does not lower the chance to get critically hit. We all know that it stands that, but they changed so it wouldnt affect PvE ages ago.<br />
<br />
I dont know how long you have been playing but they made that change in TBC.</div></div><hr />

I was under the same impression that they had changed it and was laughing at resilence tanks until I started tanking and started actually READING Tankspot, Elitist Jerks, and WoWWiki.<br />

IT DOES WORK IN PVE STILL AS OF PATCH 3.3<br />

<br />
Up to date Defense + Resilence formulas<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/Defense<br />
<br />
All Resilence changes done by patches:<br />
# Patch 3.2.0 (2009-08-04): No longer reduces the amount of damage done by damage-over-time spells, but instead reduces the amount of all damage done by players by the same proportion. In addition, the amount of resilience needed to reduce critical strike chance, critical strike damage and overall damage has been increased by 15%.<br />
# Patch 3.0.3 (2008-11-04): The damage reduction component of resilience has been increased from 2 times the critical strike chance reduction to 2.2 times the critical strike chance reduction. In addition, the maximum damage reduction to a critical strike from resilience has been increased from 30% to 33%.<br />
# Patch 2.4.0 (2008-03-25): Now reduces the magnitude of mana draining effects by the same amount that it reduces critical strike damage. The Tooltip has been revised to reflect this.<br />
<br />
None of those had anything to do with PvE. Where is this mysterious patch that everybody keeps referring to? Because whatever it was supposed to change regarding resilence in PvE - It didn't. Go test it yourself.<br />
<br />
Okay, I feel as if I've instructed enough for the day.</div></div><hr />
