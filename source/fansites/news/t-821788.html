Rated BGs Now Award Honor at Conquest Cap<br />
We've recently made a change in an effort to promote continued play in Rated Battlegrounds. Now when a player is at their weekly Conquest cap they will receive the full amount of Honor from kills, objective completions, victories and losses while in a Rated Battleground match. Those not at their cap will continue to earn Conquest normally, and will only earn Honor once they reach their weekly cap.<br />
<br />
Whether you’re capped and others on your team aren’t, or you’re all capped and just want to keep playing, we hope this change will allow more flexibility for those participating in Rated Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />

Magmaw 25 Heroic World First Kill by Method<br />

<br />
As far as I recall they raided combined 10 mans with another guild cause they didn't have all their members get a beta key. Unlike some other 'top' guilds. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I tried to follow my old guild's progress in beta and it's what I remember seeing on their website. <br />
Anyway, good to see Method back at top again after the somewhat disappointing ICC times.</div></div><hr />

2 whole weeks have passed since 15th Dec, and right now it's 3rd week of progress on heroics encounters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do the speed of these world first kills do enough to shut people up on difficulty of content?<br />
Well, in Icecrown Citadel it took 2 days to clear 11/12 HC since heroic raids were available :)<br />
In Cataclysm it took 2 weeks to have 6/13 HC.</div></div><hr />

What are you trying to say? This content is easy? Afterall you also are 7/12 hc right? The top guilds in the world are doing what they do best. Throwing themselves at an encounter for hours and hours everyday until they defeat it, its time and skill, just because 1 guild or a few guilds are deep into heroics right now, doesn't mean it is easy. There is a reason why they are called the top guilds in the world...</div></div><hr />

let me rephrase so you understand what i'm saying, i dont say its too easy, all i'm saying is being the first is fine if theres a competition going on, being the first while the other top guilds are on break chillaxing isnt worth as much :(<br />
<br />
the dude i was talkin to, was measuring the diffculty of those heroic bosses by the time it took to get them killed and thats just wrong over winterbreak, all i'm saying is lets see how long they'll last in the new year when every top guild is dedicated to downing them no matter what.</div></div><hr />

Rephrased this says, &quot;I'm a huge fanboi of another top end guild and am butt hurt that they aren't getting any world first's so I'm going to make excuses on their behalf.&quot;<br />

OR<br />
<br />
Rephrased this says, &quot;I'm a member of another top end guild that is butt hurt we aren't getting world firsts and going to make excuses why we are unable to.&quot;<br />

In either case, grats to Method for being the current #1 guild and cry more to the OP.<br />

Its obvious its harder because look at wrath content, most of it, except ulduar, was cleared by these guilds on heroic withing the first 2-3 days excluding the end boss or sometimes including it. I cant wait to see how long it takes for the world first sinestra kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While it is definitely an exagerration to refer to raiding in beta as putting these encounters on &quot;farm&quot; status once the content goes live, it would be totally remiss to not consider how huge an advantage it was to be raiding this stuff in the beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because we handled loot before the screenshot, and because we still have a hard time getting everyone in line for a screenshot, the boss despawned on us before the shot was taken :D<br />
The fight was frapsed and ventrillo was recorded. We enjoyed this encounter a lot and will release the first kill video (including nerdscreams) in the future.</div></div><hr />

I know you're super busy, Boub, but can you give a slightly more specific idea of what's going on with the guides? Are you deleting the ones that didn't win or are you just moving them around? It makes some of us who put alot of effort into our a guides a little nervous to think you might just be deleting them. D:</div></div><hr />

Interesting to see that the jump in difficulty on Magmaw must be greater than it is on some of the other bosses, e.g Chimaeron.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I believe content is fine right now. Your results are proportionate to the quality of effort that you put in with your time, and the dedication of the people you are working with to get the boss down.<br />
<br />
Even if they raid a lot, they learn from their mistakes quickly and recoup to make swift progress on the next attempt. Their goal in the game is to kill bad guys as soon as possible, not fart around on quests. :-)</div></div><hr />

They migrated on Xavius EU (free migration to low server) few months before cataclysm is released. No queues, no lags and u got results...<br />
