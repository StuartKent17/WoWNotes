The game is old, there are new things to try, and in all seriousness who expected Wow to keep 10 million+ subs going when they are approaching the 10 year mark?<br />
<br />
I like this Xpac. The raiding has been well done, but it was very unfriendly to alts, and some people like to play multiple toons. We will probably get a bump with 5.4 and then another drop until the next xpac.<br />
<br />
I agree with what someone said earlier, I could see wow losing subs until about the 5 million mark and then stabilizing for a long while.</div></div><hr />

However, I do agree with the low pop issues that needs resolving quickly. I play on a low-populated server and it really feels kind of dead compared to before. Recruiting is difficult and the last 5-7 recruits we've had have been found on other realms. (This is good for Blizzard though, more transfer money - tinfoilhat). <br />

All in all, the only thing that's making the game not enjoyable is the lack of people around on certain servers. Fix it soon!</div></div><hr />

They cant make the game like they used to because people will cry too much about the difficulty of the game. They keep nerfing everything for the bads/casuals and the game is becoming crap. What happened to getting better so you can down more bosses? Try recruiting out of this abysmal talent pool, i know lots of guilds called it quite because of just that. They nerf everything so people never have to improve to get better which leads you to a horrid player base to try and recruit from.</div></div><hr />

Anger or not, he's right. MMO market is no longer growing, and is in fact quickly decreasing, with new brands failing to claim a more-than-niche part of the cake.<br />

<br />
Stroke your ego more, but you couldn't be more wrong. While yes I am sure SOME of the subs were lost for that reason.. more so a lot of them are from the EAST which means probably farmers moving onto other games, or realizing hey i don't need 20 accounts to make gold anymore since there's such an influx and availability of it now.. so reducing down their backend cost to make money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think that's pretty accurate. It is for me. I bought MoP, dinged 90, did some dungeons, did some heroics, did a few days of dailies, and quit. It's the same with any game that people have &quot;quit&quot; who dip their toes back into the water.. it's very difficult to keep their attention. Will I repeat the above with the next expansion? Maybe. If it looks good and I have hopes it might entertain me again.<br />
<br />
I've been playing WoW since 1.10. The days of daily play are long gone for me. But expansions do still spark a little interest. But sadly it doesn't last long.<br />

I don't understand people and their problem with this. We didn't have lfr or lfg until Cata/Wotlk. Before then people had to organize groups or be in a guild to raid, and even then it wasn't a guarantee you would get loot. So why is there any difference now? You're getting more now than you ever were, at least now if you don't get loot you get a bag with a chance at SOMETHING. Something is better than nothing which you normally got for killing a boss in prior expansions.<br />
<br />
So to anyone crying because they don't get at least one epic/upgrade for every lfr run, stfu.</div></div><hr />

And the expansion even had a pretty good start with a lot of players returning (like myself), but a lot of those seems to have quit again (like myself). But on a positive side, there is a lot of great MMO's out there to play, and i think it would be good if WoW lost even more and then stabelize around 3 million. Then we can have a nice market where several MMO's have a million or 2 subs/active accounts, which will breed more competition, and a better experience for the customers.</div></div><hr />

LFR is just a braindead walk, heroics arent really hard, the lack of instances (5mans) and just the content in boring. I'm going back to it, when either something cool happens or when the next expansion comes. It just doesnt appeal to me these days, i had enough of dailies tbh. I went back to SWTOR and it feel so more rewarding to do quests, the stories are awesome and it's fun to play, the operations are fun and it's star wars. (even though people seem to be against it *gets a pitchfork* ) but coming back to wow; it's just &quot;dailies hell&quot;.. <br />
The thing they need to improve is; remove lfr and make lfr and normal the same, make heroics harder; they are waaaay too easy now, and Blizz need to test raids themself, doing it on a ptr is cool, but whats the point if everyone and their grandma done it in the ptr and just steamroll through it on live..</div></div><hr />

WoW is still absurdly profitable (and would be absurdly profitable with half these subs), but its sort of a sign that Titan needs to come sooner than later. They know that there is 12-13 million potential subs out there in the MMO market. If they want to rake in all of them, they need a new game. Period.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but Idc what your view on the game is... I really don't. I played at 2500~ mmr, i raided hardcore during TBC... I played the game when it was amazing... I played it when it offered a real challenge. What you claim to be good is what I'd consider crap. Raiding is nothing but recycled mechanics.... trust me, I've been watching streams on twitch of all the raids, they don't look hard at all. PvP is utter crap now... blizzards illogical idea of balancing classes was a prime example of retardation. &quot;Oh hey guys, lets balance the game by removing every unique ability in the game that other classes don't have... bloodlust? Time warp w/ speed boost. Totem buffs? Every class has equivalent 30 min buffs. Windfury totem? Too diverse. Kick? Hell, give one to everyone and a silence too.&quot; Not to mention that certain comps are too overpowered and it doesn't matter how well you play, a slight slip up will give them the easy kill because it's effortless. You might like the game for some reason, but anyone who played hardcore can concur with me that the game is nothing but an exoskeleton of what it used to be. Just because you sprinkle glitter on a piece of poop, doesn't mean it's going to look any better than a piece of poop. WoW is poop if you didn't get what I was saying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the game is improving. the problem is, it's STILL wow. despite frequent content updates. some of best raids ever. tons and tons of content, it's STILL wow. for example, i've been around many years. i know the raids and content is good, but i'd still rather play something fresher. ya know? Everquest is better than it's ever been, is it number 1? no. things get old. WoW will jump each new expansion, then bleed out from monotony that is still wow. It's still an old cat no matter how many new tricks it learns. Put it next to a kitten and you can't compete, unless that kitten scratches you and claws up your furniture that is (ie the game is an utter disaster)<br />
The reason people keep returning to wow is the plain ole fact, no one has done better yet, plain and simple. Until someone does, wow will be king. however, it's going to stay in an endless cycle of &quot;new expansion, lets see if i can feel it this time&quot;. followed by &quot;yeah i still don't feel it, bye bye&quot;<br />
<br />
this is not me saying wow is bad at all. it's greatest it's ever been. it's great for new users. but all us vets, which are still a large sum of people, monotony</div></div><hr />

Yes, 8.3 million is good. It's great, even! Few other games can boast such high numbers, especially after WoW has been out for this long. But come on, even the most devoted WoW player needs to realize facts - a subscription loss of 1.3 million in a single quarter is srs business. Imagine if that subscription loss continued for a year - that'd be 5.2 million subs lost. In a year!<br />
<br />
It's naive to think that this won't affect your WoW experience. As WoW's subscription base declines, so will the resources available for Blizzard to maintain the game. The quality and quantity of content will be affected. WoW will no doubt live on for many years to come, but it's very obvious the game is on the decline.</div></div><hr />

They didn't hit those big numbers until Wrath, and then started seeing the retreat after Cataclysm. There's not much else they can do here except add QOL and add new artwork with the same mechanics over and over. At this point, the only really redeeming thing in the game is the storyline. Outside of that it's all been done before.</div></div><hr />

Recycled mechanics? Well I'll be, if only there were unlimited ways to do things, sadly there isn't so ahh well. I played Hardcore Raiding in TBC as well, guess what? The fights in MOP are far superior. Lets look at the so called hard raid of Sunwell, you had fights which were based around numbers, that was it. Dodging a wave of fire isn't that hard. At least now you have to do something.</div></div><hr />

Yes, 8.3 million is good. It's great, even! Few other games can boast such high numbers, especially after WoW has been out for this long. But come on, even the most devoted WoW player needs to realize facts - a subscription loss of 1.3 million in a single quarter is srs business. Imagine if that subscription loss continued for a year - that'd be 5.2 million subs lost. In a year!<br />
<br />
It's naive to think that this won't affect your WoW experience. As WoW's subscription base declines, so will the resources available for Blizzard to maintain the game. The quality and quantity of content will be affected. WoW will no doubt live on for many years to come, but it's very obvious the game is on the decline.<br />
<br />
I've been telling them the exact same thing, but they never seem to listen. Probably still in denial phase</div></div><hr />

You didnt debunk anything, you are the king of whiners on here.

Worst part is they had this loss in a quarter where they released a major patch. Hard to find much reason why 5.3 is gonna reverse the trend if 5.2 was this terrible for subs. I wouldn't be shocked if the next 2 quarters combined bring another 3-4 million in losses.</div></div><hr />

In TBC I was a casual kid. I raided Karazhan, gruuls, maggy and I even made it into TK/SSC and Hyjal right before WOTLK. And you know what? I was thrilled. I was really satisfied. I didnt care if I got to see the insane new raid &quot;Sunwell&quot; at the time. My thought were like &quot;Shit, the guys that are doing that must be so fucking pro.

While yes I am sure SOME of the subs were lost for that reason.. more so a lot of them are from the EAST which means probably farmers moving onto other games, or realizing hey i don't need 20 accounts to make gold anymore since there's such an influx and availability of it now.. so reducing down their backend cost to make money.<br />
So you're admitting to gold farming correct? You seem to know how it all works and how they do it right? Oh you don't? Oh you've never farmed gold yourself? Oh you've never watched someone from the east farm gold? Oh you don't know what you're talking about but like to act like you are? Stop acting as if you know how it all works... stop justifying the sub loss... they went down because WoW is an old outdated game that people are slowly finding out that it isn't fun to play, that's simple. When they say east, how do you know they're not talking east america? Did they say east asia? Or asia in general? I didn't think so.</div></div><hr />

Even though you don't provide any info or sources... I'm inclined to believe you, only because I know something.

I can sub for a month and feed my nostalgia with those terms. Game is worth 15 bucks to me for a month to re-acquaint myself with my druid. Heck, maybe even a free month will be in the deal! <br />
<br />
It is a greater loss than I expected, but I don't see the game attracting many new players at this point. I know it's got awesome gameplay, but I struggle really hard to look past those graphics now.<br />
<br />
There is just too many other F2P, really pretty mmo's out there with matching gameplay. Also, with Haswell coming out with a GPU that can run newer gen MMO's a bit easier, people aren't going to stick around and accept those Nintendo graphics.<br />
<br />
I still love my time spent in WoW and some of my fondest mmo memories were there, and it is an awesome game, but the only way is down for most subscription-based games now.<br />

<br />
or like intelligent people, we don't assume a trend will continue without reason. 1.3 Million leaving this quarter doesn't mean 1.3 next quarter. You also need to understand that a game this old, holding 8.3 Is amazing. Even if you lose 1.3 in a quarter who may be unsubbing after they did the lfr tier or something. Also it's from the east, where they have loads of f2p mmo's to choose from...</div></div><hr />

1)Logging in only once a week to get cap in arena/RBG, what a waste of £9 a month I could spend on LoL and get a champion I will likely play more than 2 or 3 hours a month.<br />
2)I rolled the wrong class, this is stupid I keep dying to shit that globals me or simply has gear I can't compete it, going into arena got me met with people with ridiculous MMR.<br />
3)Raiding is so grindy, LFR is long considering it's casual. Several hours of wiping to useless shit and waiting around is no fun.<br />
4)The daily rep grinds.<br />

Subs will drop, there's only so long people can enjoy what is fundamentally the same game. I kind of hope subs continue to shrink so there's greater incentive to merge all the low-pop and badly balanced servers into more robust, dynamic populations. I think WoW has reached a point where the size of the player base is doing more harm than good to the game. <br />
<br />
If we can see it drop to ~7 million or so that could be for the best.</div></div><hr />

I didnt link them here, it was in another thread. Why would they make another Mmo like wow when they have wow? And i linked many sources and some well known facts such as the Dev team and their interviews. There would be no business sense in making another wow. The idea is to make Titan really challenging and make it a E-sport players will respect and put in their tournaments while leaving wow for the players wanting less of a challenge.

Altalysm er I mean Cataclysm was a reason for a lot of people going fuck this. granted I will say the amount of dallies you had to do to get gear this Expac was awful, it's better then what was handed out to people at the tail ends of Warth and even MORE so in Cata, i literally had 8 toons that were geared enough to run regular DS. Dallies are not the way to go, but unless they come up with a new way to take up peoples time they aren't going to go away.</div></div><hr />

Compared to Cataclysm, it's much better.<br />
<br />
Compared to Wrath, less so. I know lots of people will disagree, but I am prefering MOP to TBC. Seriously, I'm not even sure what I did during TBC, I didn't raid. Did a few BGs and dungeons a week (when I could find a tank which wasn't always possible), and the sunwell dailies.<br />
<br />
Which isn't all that different to my experience now, only I managed to find a fairly laid back once-a-week raid group in WOTLK and have stuck with them ever since.<br />
<br />
For me, WOTLK was the peak, but I really don't think MOP is that far behind. The biggest criticsm I have of the game is that after so many years it is all getting a bit... samey.</div></div><hr />

That's like saying &quot;I'm enjoying this non air-conditioned cross-country road trip with my family more than that drug-free root canal.&quot; I haven't logged in to WoW in quite some time and every time I do I spend about 10 minutes getting into something and then just can't sit there and wait for my queue to pop for LFR so I can get a pittance of gold again. I just stopped having fun and even things I did regularly for fun just stopped being fun. I can't log in to an alt without stopping after about 3 quests because I start adding up all the crap I have to do with that character once 90 JUST to be close to where my main is (and the big killer is Golden Lotus and Shado-Pan rep for enchants.) Cataclysm sucked, hard, but MoP was a swing way too far in the other direction but way more of a grind.</div></div><hr />

Everquest is better than it's ever been, is it number 1? no. things get old. WoW will jump each new expansion, then bleed out from monotony that is still wow. It's still an old cat no matter how many new tricks it learns. Put it next to a kitten and you can't compete, unless that kitten scratches you and claws up your furniture that is (ie the game is an utter disaster)<br />
The reason people keep returning to wow is the plain ole fact, no one has done better yet, plain and simple. Until someone does, wow will be king. however, it's going to stay in an endless cycle of &quot;new expansion, lets see if i can feel it this time&quot;. followed by &quot;yeah i still don't feel it, bye bye&quot;<br />
<br />
this is not me saying wow is bad at all. it's greatest it's ever been. it's great for new users. but all us vets, which are still a large sum of people, monotony<br />
<br />
No, it's not &quot;still WoW&quot;. It's a lobby game. The roleplaying, adventure, and immersion aspects have basically been killed, along with a great deal of the player's freedom in how to approach the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Though the majority of our subscriber decline occurred mainly in the east, where we have more subscribers and lower revenue per subscriber,&quot; Activision-Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said in a financials call, &quot;We saw declines in the west as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While we do believe further declines are likely and we expect to have fewer subscribers at year-end than we do today, World of Warcraft remains one of the most successful franchises in the history of entertainment,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
-snip-<br />
<br />
I think that pretty much sums it up. Activision Blizzard themselves know the game is old, and that subs are going to keep declining. Why anyone here would argue against that, I don't know.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celista</div><div class="date">2013-05-08, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love MoP. Really, I think this is one of the game's best expansions by far.<br />
<br />
That being said....(in my opinion):<br />
<br />
1. Aging game in a competitive F2P mmo atmosphere in NA, EUR and Asia<br />
2. Dated graphics engine, questing style, etc (as other games are turning to dynamic questing and other gameplay features)<br />
3. Lack of balance making the game undesirable as an e-sport<br />
4. PvP changes and removal of a sense of gearing/progression in pvp with ilvl caps, etc<br />
<br />
There have been some odd changes this expansion/last expansion, I see a lot of odd decisions being made by the development teams and reading GC try to justify some of these changes just makes them even more odd-seeming...more so in Cata than perhaps this expansion, although pvp changes have been just strange.<br />
<br />
WoW needs a fresh development/management team, the game is losing SOME subs due to it being in a natural state of decline for any product (google product life cycle if you don't know what I am talking about), but the game needs a fresh approach if it doesn't want to hasten the decline. <br />
<br />
It could bounce back, but not without fresh ideas/perspective.</div></div><hr />

You will never know for sure becouse Arena is not obliged to publish such statistics as Blizzard is. The only hint you may get are game tracking applications like Xfire, Raptr etc. And there GW2 seems to be at around half of WoW's numbers. As for SWTOR, yes, it fell below 1 million before F2P. After F2P they noted an increase and are now at around 1/3 of WoW's numbers (again, its about Xfire, Raptr etc.)</div></div><hr />

TBC had about that amount, and the community was much better than it has been for the last 4 or so years. More players = more douchebags.<br />

^^ Only one who cares are trolls and butthurt people. I will likely play WoW till i either cant cause of work (Army) or the servers shutdown. Others not playing will not stop my enjoyment of the game. (Like you said it may make me enjoy it more) <br />
Plus the game is almost 9 years old, its had a pretty good run imo. When the game hits 1 million players it will still have more players then a lot of other newer MMO's so meh.<br />

It won't ever go back to original, that changed right before wotlk... when activison and blizzard merged. They took the entire dev team off of WoW and put them on Titan.

Dallies are not the way to go, but unless they come up with a new way to take up peoples time they aren't going to go away.<br />
<br />
Exactly, you had 8 toons and that kept your attention on the game. As I said, Replay Value matters when you're taking into consideration monthly fees. Being alt friendly doesn't mean that it should be easy to gear up. Time is not the only thing to take into consideration when gearing a character. How about a system that lets you gear a little slower than on Wrath but with the same difficulty as TBC heroics? A system that takes into consideration gearing choices instead of the actual &quot;LOL STR&quot; micromanaging? That's what I meant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because geographically speaking the 'East' refers to Asia. Are you an idiot? <br />
Asia's subscriber base doesn't pay a monthly fee like we do, for the most part. They pay by the hour at internet cafes and other internet venues. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1.3m Subscribers with majority of the lost from the East has nothing to do with North America or EU. In fact, the subscriber base in the US/EU servers is probably quite stable and Activision should release a report that splits up the numbers by region to debunk this fiasco so people can stop complaining that the game is going in the shitter. <br />
<br />
MoP has been unfriendly on alts but, the current tier is refreshing, the bosses are fun and the content has been well designed. And unfriendly on alts or not, I still have 9 90s, most of which are fully geared and able to get into ToT LFR. So if you think MoP is that horrible on alts, you just aren't trying hard enough. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, the newer generation of players don't go in for grinds most of the time. It's not an instant gratification thing, it's just how the industry has evolved. We all played games like vanilla WoW, EQ, Eve Online, FFXI, etc. because that was the industry at the time and what we became accustomed to. Vanilla-like grinds and huge difficulties are pretty much never coming back, and it's almost suicide to actually try to put that into a game (look at FFXIV 1.0).<br />
<br />
<br />
If people are only subscribed based on how many subs there currently are that's sad on their part. People should only play a game when they enjoy it and stop playing once they no longer enjoy it.<br />
<br />
It depends on the sub that's lost. If 5 people are irl friends and one of them quits, then there's a good chance the other 4 will join them. Then someone else may quit because they quit. And so on...</div></div><hr />

How well do we appreciate Eastern interpretations of Western culture? Also, being obviously China-centric, how well does that go over in Korea, where as we know recently a number of servers were merged?<br />
<br />
Picture this. A Japanese game company has a worldwide hit MMO, then they release a Western-themed, US-centric expansion called Bald Eagleland. How well would that go over in Mexico, or Canada, or even Europe? Moreover, how would it go over in the US, where players would be treated to a litany of stereotypes purveyed by foreigners who only know of their culture through Clint Eastwood and pro wrestling cliches?</div></div><hr />

DO SCENARIOS! NO NEW 5MANS!&quot; They limit the real content that people WANT and then brush it over with some crap that they think we should have...and when we say &quot;hey, this isn't cool&quot; they just dismiss it by saying &quot;but we're giving you SO much to work with now compared to X Y and Z expansions.&quot; Well, that's really fucking cute and all, but if you're giving us content that we WON'T PLAY or DON'T LIKE it's not going to entice anyone to stick around no matter how much sugar you pile on top of it.<br />
<br />
World of Dailycraft and World of Gated Rep was a fucking HORRID idea. I REALLY REALLY REALLY hope, for the sake of WoW continuing, that they learned their lesson.<br />
<br />
I totally understand their IDEA behind &quot;we WANT you see the content we spent a lot of time working on&quot; but it doesn't pan out for the playerbase as a whole. The explorers and completionists will go and pick thru everything and see it all...but forcing EVERYONE down the same, repetitive, boring path and saying &quot;YOU MUST COMPLETE A B AND C before you can even think about accessing D; and furthermore if you want E you need to compelte D&quot; was just a bad move. Especially for late starters/slow players or people that can't dedicate hours and hours to playing each day.<br />
<br />
The gearing in MoP has been horriffically bad and they won't even admit it. Oh, get rep with factions to get low level, useless blues and then get MORE rep for epics that you'll probably replace if you raid.<br />
<br />
Visually this has been a stellar x-pack. Playing it though, that has been painful, slow and just uninteresting.</div></div><hr />

This is ironic since a fair share of people posting in this thread claim that the game is still &quot;too hard&quot; or has too much &quot;grinding&quot;.<br />
<br />
The amounts of pats on your own back in this thread is pretty hilarious, though. It's an old game and these numbers represent subscribers in the *middle* of a non-raid patch, in the *middle* of an expansion. As a Blizzard fanboy, I would have still predicted around a 1mil sub &quot;loss&quot; based solely on the timeline. <br />
<br />
There's no question there are still improvements that can be made, but MoP has been extremely enjoyable for me with the exception of dailies, which I just personally don't enjoy, but you don't need to enjoy every aspect of a game this large. Raiding has been great, hope they continue to put out solid raid content on a timely basis.</div></div><hr />

People have been asking for this for forever. I think it would be a great idea to give them what they want if Blizzard released these servers in stages (like a vanilla server with MC only, then progressive patches putting in BWL, AQ, Naxx etc). <br />
<br />
The only reason they won't do it is because of cost, which would likely way, way exceed the marginal interest people would have in such servers. Also people will get bored having to clear level 60 content with 39 other people when they can just log into their level capped toons on normal servers and decimate everything in seconds.</div></div><hr />

Basking about how your predictions came trough even though any 3 year old could have predicted the same (&quot;holy shit I am pretty sure it's going to rain in England within the next month!&quot;).

There is still all of the above. You can still go out and find fun things to do on your own. The other day I went to Winterspring for the first time in several years. Nostalgia set in -- all those hours spent on Timbermaw rep grind back in those days. Then another several hundred hours on my alliance NE for the Frostsaber mount. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baracuda</div><div class="date">2013-05-08, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the game is improving. the problem is, it's STILL wow. despite frequent content updates. some of best raids ever. tons and tons of content, it's STILL wow. for example, i've been around many years. i know the raids and content is good, but i'd still rather play something fresher. ya know? Everquest is better than it's ever been, is it number 1? no. things get old. WoW will jump each new expansion, then bleed out from monotony that is still wow. It's still an old cat no matter how many new tricks it learns. Put it next to a kitten and you can't compete, unless that kitten scratches you and claws up your furniture that is (ie the game is an utter disaster)<br />
The reason people keep returning to wow is the plain ole fact, no one has done better yet, plain and simple. Until someone does, wow will be king. however, it's going to stay in an endless cycle of &quot;new expansion, lets see if i can feel it this time&quot;. followed by &quot;yeah i still don't feel it, bye bye&quot;<br />
<br />
this is not me saying wow is bad at all. it's greatest it's ever been. it's great for new users. but all us vets, which are still a large sum of people, monotony<br />
<br />
This isn't why I keep leaving, I keep leaving because they keep IGNORING server problems. You play on a low server you have no one to play with, you play on a full server you have queues and the opposing faction is exctinct(high servers eventually become full) and we STILL can't play arena cross-realm. I'm sure they're working on fixing this but we need it YESTERDAY!<br />
<br />
The game is better than ever, imo, but these things that have nothing to do with the gameplay itself ruins it...</div></div><hr />

BC as a teenager vs. MoP as a mid-twenties year old. . . . probably not a good comparison<br />

(I obviously have no idea how old you really are, but this is generally *fairly* accurate I think)<br />

Think about it this way: Someone who got into WoW at release at age 16 would now be 25 years old. IE: Career, House, Kids, etc. They're either tired of the game period, or just don't have the time to commit to it anymore.

That is pretty much the same thing as saying that a 60 year old man running a 100 m dash on 13 sec. is a fail. If this expansion was put out 5 years ago, it probably wouldn't have lost any near that many.</div></div><hr />

which I'm fine with on both. I don't give a shit about Chinese dropping en mass. nor do I much care for the people who don't have the time/patience to grind to get the gear they want. if you want instant mindless satisfaction they have mobil games for that. and if you don't have the time sorry, but you have to deal with either less then stellar gear or just walk away.</div></div><hr />

So far this expact many of the people I played with since early vanilla have left. <br />
<br />
One of the main reasons is that dailies felt too much like the tuber / blasted lands mindless farming to get ready for raid day that blizz said they wanted to get rid of. Now instead of farming tubers and basilik brains (just an example) you farm dailies to get ready for raid! Are dailies necesary? No and neither was tuber farming but try telling that to the rest of the raid / raid leader!<br />
<br />
It's sad but options like running all your random dungeons in one day for those that are limited time players to get all there valor, having 5 mans come out with raids to fill in gaps, having an easy alt progression path etc etc are all things that have taken a step back to the old ways and have chased off many :(<br />

Both the wow is dying and it's not dying crowds are kind of correct. To play devil's advocate, people that say lol wow isn't dying, do you think wow will be around forever? Blizzard knows that wow (and really the mmo industry tbh) has been in slow decline since around 2008-2009. It's been slow, but the graph has been a clear downward curve in sub numbers with just some brief bumps up around expansion releases. That doesn't mean wow is shutting down next month or next year, but it won't be around forever. That said it will probably be around a long time. If they had to they could cut development to a minimum and the costs to maintain the servers and support would be extremely low. They could probably support even just 1 million or less subs. The only reason this recurring debate comes up every quarter and has any importance is that if sub numbers drop enough, Blizzard could pull off (more) developers for other projects which would mean less wow content. Along the same lines, if sub numbers drop enough Blizzard might say that it's embarrassing or hurting the Blizzard brand and pull the plug. Wow has been a ridiculous cash cow so Blizzard will just move onto another product with a similar business and gaming model, Titan or something else, if they make that decision. Blizzard is smart and has far more player information than is public, so you can be sure they will be the first to see which direction the game is headed in popularity. That's probably why they pulled off the top wow developers for Titan a few years ago to stay ahead of the curve.</div></div><hr />

How has this caused a rift? People would unsub and have unsubbed in the past when they felt like the raid content was too difficult. True, people are still unsubbing now, but could that perhaps be due in part to people becoming tired of the raiding model in general?</div></div><hr />

Imagine if that subscription loss continued for a year - that'd be 5.2 million subs lost. In a year!<br />
<br />
It's naive to think that this won't affect your WoW experience. As WoW's subscription base declines, so will the resources available for Blizzard to maintain the game. The quality and quantity of content will be affected. WoW will no doubt live on for many years to come, but it's very obvious the game is on the decline.<br />
<br />
Absolutely true. It is easier for people to head in the sand it though.</div></div><hr />

right..?<br />
hoping to much maybe, but anyway people probably quit from broken PVP, and thinking if they dont do dailys they cant do things at all, and then the east is just, the east as its always been with subs</div></div><hr />

They have most of the original WoW Dev team working for them. They are bringing back 40man raids and such. They even stated that most MMO's cater 99% of the player base, the casuals. However they want to cater to the 1%.<br />

I enjoy it when people who I fundamentally disagree with stick to their guns like that. I will be very happy if they become a disastrous confirmation that they were wrong.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">markdall</div><div class="date">2013-05-08, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I'm done with wow once MOP ends, or earlier if I lose my raid spot for some reason. Why? <br />
<br />
1. Cross Realm Zones - they add people to kill you, but not people that can join your guild or contribute to your AH, server economy, etc. Everybody kills you or takes the mining node you found or is a bot taking the mining node you found. Yip-frigging-ee. <br />
2. Rep-gated VP gear - makes sense (if you're Blizzard) to drag things out and make them take longer, but tedium &lt;&gt; fun. <br />
3. Scenarios over 5 mans - I wrote a huge post on what they could be doing with scenarios, but they're not. Scenarios aren't fun. MOP 5 mans aren't really fun either, actually. <br />
<br />
I fear for the next expansion _and_ Titan because I don't think Blizzard thinks any of the above are bad. They like all those things. Well, I don't. Given how things are going, Titan will be a console based + smart phone appified + real money AH/microtransaction + cross realm + tons of catering to people who enjoy making your life hell. (aka 13 year olds, or people with the maturity of a 13 year old. _I_ was just like that at 13.) Every aspect of it will be designed to be dragged out and take forever, because if Blizzard is anything, what they aren't is stupid. They're smart, super-smart. Just not necessarily benevolent. No business is, really. Not all the time. <br />
<br />
Please note: I'd love to be wrong about all this. I don't write any of the above smugly, but rather sadly. I enjoy wow and have for nearly a decade now. I don't want to play another game. But I don't truly want to play wow anymore, either because of what it has become.</div></div><hr />
