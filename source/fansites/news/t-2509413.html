As soon as possible, we will identify those who knowingly abused this bug in exploitative manner. We will then take appropriate punitive measures.<br />
<br />
As a reminder, Blizzard’s End User License Agreement defines cheats as “methods not expressly authorized by Blizzard, influencing and/or facilitating the gameplay, including exploits of any in-game bugs, and thereby granting you and/or any other user an advantage over other players not using such methods.”<br />

Blizzard Clarification on Punishments Coming for Layering Exploit<br />
Soooooo since I’m seeing a lot of confusion (here and elsewhere), here’s some insight into how we draw the line between what makes something a punishable exploit versus a “happy little accident.”<br />
<br />
The key factor here is intent. Did the player do something with the specific intention of causing a glitch to occur, and did they do it order to exploit said glitch for their own benefit?<br />
<br />
This recent glitch makes a pretty clean example. The players who were abusing it had to do some Very Weird Stuff to cause it to occur, and then did so repeatedly. No reasonable person would expect that this behavior was intended, and the players involved had to go out of their way to cause it. It’s obviously unintended, it’s obviously a glitch, and the people who abused it were obviously exploiting said glitch for their own benefit. That’s pretty open and shut.<br />
Someone mentioned Esfand’s random MC reset in this thread, which is a pretty clean example of the other end of the spectrum. In that case, they just turned up to raid and the instance had been reset. They didn’t do anything intentional to cause it or go looking for reproduction steps so they could abuse it - in fact, they reported it to us and didn’t continue until they got confirmation that it was out of their control (and that we wouldn’t consider it an exploit if they cleared).<br />
<br />
Side note for the curious: that was a completely separate bug that has existed since 2004, and actually happened several times back then, it just wasn’t being broadcast to thousands of viewers at the time.<br />
<br />
Obviously, neither situation is ideal - we try our best to provide a fair playing field for everyone - but there’s a pretty massive difference between “the instance is reset and we don’t know why” and “if we do this One Weird Trick we can infinitely farm this dungeon boss.” That’s the key factor that turns something from an accident into an exploit.<br />
<br />
This ended up being longer than I expected so I’ll wrap it up with one last caveat: there is a lot of context and nuance that goes into these situations, and they’re not usually as cut and dry as these two examples. We end up making a lot of judgement calls based on the specifics of each exploit as well as their overall impact on the game (the phrase “clever use of game mechanics” originally came from one such convoluted situation). These two cases just happen to be pretty obvious.</div></div><hr />

The clarification is not about how the punishement will look like. It's just a clarification why there will be a punishment and what qualifies as bannable exploit. It was a reposne to topic on the forums where some people argued that it's their right to exploit bugs for their benefits or something.<br />
<br />
As for punishements according to reddit they are mostly 1 month ban plus they take away the stuff you farmed. I also saw a screenshot of 1 year ban so the length might vary depending on how much you did it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now truth be told the story said nothing about how often he did so it could be once, twice or a billion times. I just still think a month timeout and items removed is extremely soft.</div></div><hr />

I have seen way to many players with 2x t2 form abusing the bug in mc and onyxia the market is also flooded by rare raid and dungeon recipes.<br />
There is also a questionable amount of people that already have there epic mounts already.<br />
If nothing is done the market and server economy will be screwed for pretty much forever and it will encourage people to abuse exploits when they can and the gains will be permanent for a temporarily punishment.<br />

Its like letting a a robber who stole millions keep all the money after hes done in prison is juts makes no sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- players who used the 10 man dungeon XP boost even on streams...said XP was not right at the start, pressed on. layering dungeons with 10 mans for serious fast leveling, was being done within first days of launch. many did it off streams, more popular streamers where on their VODs,wondering how others were infinitely doing SM, ZF, etc dungeons when players were in the 30-50+ zone at classic launch, yet they were being locked out after 5 runs. some even on streams, started experimenting [B](INTENTIONALLY). then when they found out how some used used it on and off stream, then talking about it next day on stream when viewers noticed the level jump. some said what they did layering wise, others just said they leveled off stream, but would slip when talking, forget, revealing the hopping.<br />
- WF 60 on stream, layer hopping was shown on stream, lesser known WOW player until he hit around 58 his stream exploded to 300K views by the time he hit 60. the hopping was intentional, not accidental, i would say, someone at blizzard was watching. this player BTW, leveled a mage on a unauthorized server which was prior to classic set up to emulate classic wow based on Beta and predownload, he leveled a mage in 2 days 7 hours about 10 days prior to classic launch. he was talked to about it, but it was blown off as...well that was a unauthorized server.<br />
- WF classic rag were smart enough no to stream parts of what they did<br />
- player who streams outside of twitch, did show layer hopping to black lotus farm. yeah only 6-8 a hour, but...not possible without layering he utilized</div></div><hr />

No, I just hate cancel/outrage culture and the internet's hivemind tendency to admonish and exaggerate the negative effects of exploits. Blizzard provided a perfectly reasonable explanation of their stance yet you still see people in this thread smugly proclaiming anything less than a permaban isn't justice served. Why? Why care so fucking much about other people's punishment? It's perverse. I do not think other people should revel in the punishment of others.</div></div><hr />

You have a weird definition of &quot;soft&quot; here. The guy lose all the things he exploited to gain, and then is froze from the game one entier month ? I mean, that's more than the time Classic has been release. Seems pretty good as far as punishment go.</div></div><hr />

hah yeah its weird. When Blizzard knew this is not intended, shouldnt they just have recommended esfand and his raid not to reclear MC? <br />
<br />
its a seperate bug, so that might have something to do with it. I still find it weird. It probably got something to do with esfands status in the wow community. Well liked guy allround with a big network, among fans and people inside Blizzard. So that probably has alot to do with it.</div></div><hr />

Well played, Blizz, well played.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now truth be told the story said nothing about how often he did so it could be once, twice or a billion times. I just still think a month timeout and items removed is extremely soft.<br />
<br />
how is that soft? they are loosing a month of their char progression and loosing all gains they had. As long as they are not keeping anything, it is a pretty good punishment. If they had released items into the market, tried hiding items, mats acquired in other accounts, that should then be perma ban. Bus as long as you can roll back any gains and give them a time out of 4 resets, it's not a bad punishment.</div></div><hr />

this is so on point! Good to see that some people are actually seeing the ultimate truth of the iluminati corporations! What had do you use?

I would punish them for their stupidity, not because they used the exploit in the first place. We all know if something is known enough it forces Blizzard to do something about it just to show they are in control and encourage fair-play. I have found exploits in other games before, and I kept them well hidden and never told anyone, even if they were single-player only.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New systems should be fully thought through, fully tested, instead of just rushed out at the last minute just before quarterly reports, b'cos thats what its realy about......money all they could see was getting more players in game to create more subs, it's not like they had nothing to go off, Shard hopping is abused to hell on live, it's pretty obvious players were going to find &quot;cracks&quot; in Layering.</div></div><hr />

And didn't mention that other guy, because Blizzard don't seem to be fond of him. I can't imagine why. /s<br />
<br />
When a raid runs into a bug that existed in 2004, probably not done on purpose. A guild running around on Baron's mount, a mount that was freaking rare back then...probably an exploit. <br />
<br />
(I haven't been paying attention to Classic at all, but you know the bug in UBRS will happen again, when the arena event bugs out. Because...Blizzard.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not anymore, it still happens from time to time, but you have to force it, and certainly not inside instances. <br />
<br />
If someone is forcing 20 layer hops in 30mins to farm a endboss only, its a exploit, there isn't even a discussion there. It just is.</div></div><hr />

None of the big streamers did this. Esfand encountered a bug in MC, reported it and was given an okey to keep going. VERY FUCKING DIFFERENT.</div></div><hr />

An alien UFO told me while returning from a trip to meet the Gnomes of Zurich and Ironforge. Or it could have been a reflection from Venus in the sky. Those men in black did wave something hi-tech and beeping in my face before they took off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its a seperate bug, so that might have something to do with it. I still find it weird. It probably got something to do with esfands status in the wow community. Well liked guy allround with a big network, among fans and people inside Blizzard. So that probably has alot to do with it.<br />
<br />
oh stop . he wanted to kill rag . they hadn't killed rag yet. they went to kill rag and all the stuff before him had respawned. they didn't care about farming the stuff before him. it was actually a hassle that they had to do everything all over again to get to him. letting them keep the loot only makes sense for making them have to re-clear everything. this wasn't some elaborate scheme to get extra loot for a streamer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I swear to fucking God, some people in this community wouldn't be happy if Blizzard publicly executed, by way of guillotine, anybody who ever exploited. It's fucking weird, and I never understood people's fascination with punishments for these kinds of things.<br />
<br />
WoW has never been exploited though. An exploit is a flaw you leverage to your own ends. So an example of this is SQL injection. You find a way to get the software to run your code for you, to get the result you want.<br />
<br />
Taking advantage of bugs will never be exploiting. Especially in a paid subscription game, there should be legal protections for the consumer that whatever code Blizzard decides to release into the wild is their responsibility. There is no reason why Blizzard should not have a team (or even an AI) checking things like boss kills per minute in raids and dungeons. Such an algorithm would have instantly caught this when it started happening and could have flagged characters for immediate review.<br />

you do realize layering isn't even supposed to work in instances, right?<br />
<br />
So any competent QA department with a budget over $10 would have:<br />
<br />
Case 1: check if layering works in dungeons</div></div><hr />
