Oh and of course, there's more to come. <br />
<br />
Important - Those are very early versions of the raids, previewed through unofficial means. This is absolutely not representative of the final version, it's just a preview. <br />

<br />
Really? Blizzard allows MMO-Champion to do this. If they wanted it down, they'd need only ask and Boubouille would comply. This was an issue settled a long time ago, grats on living under a rock for the last couple of years.</div></div><hr />

We just had a thread that basically consisted of 116+ pages of Annual Pass users being butthurt because they didn't get beta access yet while ignoring the actual, factual terms of the one-year binding contract they signed.<br />
<br />
Don't make any assumptions that your average forum user has an intellectual capacity beyond that of a squirrrel, let alone anything even remotely assembling common sense, or you will be sorely disappointed.</div></div><hr />

that's the problem. While Bibi is posting videos from sandbox and is being treated like best friend by Blizzard, while official fansites are being shat on and if they did something like this the backlash from Blizz would be brutal....</div></div><hr />

You mean no invite for you. People have been getting invited since the first day.<br />
<br />
OT: It's kinda awesome to see this stuff in its early stages. I can't wait to see how Mogu'shan Palace will look like when it's finished.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Waterisbest</div><div class="date">2012-03-29, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After watching all these videos I feel compelled to rejoin wow, at least for tier 1 of MoP as part-time player. The raids and dungeons look AMAZING! I'm pretty sure the areas are as good as the raids/dungeons. I was in Cata beta, but didn't really feel it to be anything special and due to real-life taking over I quit after WotLK. But MoP feels different. It feels... special, even though it's the most lighthearted expansion so far. I guess that's the reason why MoP feels so refreshing. It's a different approach. <br />
<br />
After seeing badass/dark/horror expansion after expansion (all three TBC, WotLK, Cata are very dark, even Vanilla is very dark), it's great to see a different setting. The art is special. It's Ulduar level art and Ulduar art is some of the most awesome, unique and attractive art I have seen not just in a video game but overall in life. <br />
<br />
You visited Ulduar just to see the art. Both Ulduar dungeons became extremely easy later on in WotLK but you still visited them because they were fun and the environment was refreshing. MoP looks to be the same. Great job Blizzard!</div></div><hr />

I find it rather enlightening to see areas that I would be surprised if they were not completely finished and then just seconds later move to areas that are nothing more than boxes. It's quite easy to forget that everything in WoW has to be placed by hand.</div></div><hr />

but more importantly, I have a question for Boub<br />
<br />
based on your years of experience can you give us some insight on the length of time it takes to create a 5 man dungeon, then create/place the mobs/bosses and possibly extrapolate a bit for us plebes on how that all adds up in length of time to create/test/release ...not trying to pin you down into something that others will pounce on and point to (either being right or wrong) but would appreciate as much of a general, non-committal answer you can give. thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
