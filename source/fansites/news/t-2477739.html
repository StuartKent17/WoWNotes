The Restless Cabal<br />

<br />
Called from the depths to retrieve three relics of ancient power, the Restless Cabal is bound to serve N’Zoth and attend to his will. Zaxasj speaks of promises and power, while Fa’thuul crushes their opposition with brute force.<br />
<br />
Uu’nat, Harbinger of the Void<br />

<br />
When she struck her bargain with N’zoth ten thousand years ago, Queen Azshara offered one of her most devoted followers into the Old God’s service. Now Uu’nat and the crawling masses he commands herald the coming of their master, as foretold by the stars.</div></div><hr />

Trial of Valour released after Emerald Nightmare and with Karazhan, with 3 unique armour sets and 3 bosses. This raid has released 7+ months after the launch raid, 3 months after the first .1 patch raid (Nighthold was the Legion equivalent), comes with 0 unique armour sets and even has 1 less boss. <br />
<br />
It's pathetic. I have to laugh if Blizzard really think that Crucible of storms is the equivalent of Trial of Valour. The closest it comes to ToV is 'oh it's a small raid'.</div></div><hr />

It’s not meant to be the equivalent. ToV was essentially a filler raid, CoS is not - it is small, yes, but it connects the dots between now and 8.2. It’s more there for story than anything<br />

ToV concluded the Stormheim story. That's for story too and was not filler.. CoS brings less (no armour sets, 1 less boss) and is merely there to connect the dots as you said. That screams filler more than ToV did.</div></div><hr />

ToV came 2 weeks after the patch.<br />
<br />
Not an entire month.<br />

It's timegating for the sake of it. Let's not pretend otherwise when a 3 boss raid can come out faster than a 2 boss raid.</div></div><hr />

Bod came with 4 unique sets and then 8 more with the warfronts/PvP sets then 2 heritage armours. Night hold came with zero new sets. 14 sets is a lot more then 3 so if your going off sets bfa wins by a landslide.</div></div><hr />

I welcome it, it's called pacing. Only just nearing the end of Jaina prog myself. Only 299 guilds world that have killed her with a huge portion of those being in the last week (~70).<br />
The raid wasn't needed super urgently whereas ToV was after EN, even in an average world 500 guild at the time there was a good 4 weeks downtime between finishing EN &amp; ToV release.</div></div><hr />

Dont waste yout ime with him he is the most negative person on the forums right now, he complain not meter what blizzard do.<br />

And you are right, they have the same release model for the raid since the introduction of diferents dificulties. And ppl still complain.</div></div><hr />

Oh shit I forgot mail exists because it's so ugly LOL. ToV came with 4 sets my mistake. Nighthold came with the full tier pieces (Emerald Nightmare didn't have full sets available) for 12 separate classes, that's not nothing.<br />
<br />
Emerald Nightmare + Nighthold = 12 class sets<br />
Trial of Valour = 4 armour sets<br />
That's 16 sets in Legion, which is more than the 14 you have counted for BFA. That isn't even including PvP sets which were recolours of the class sets, and yet BFA is still behind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Taking out recolours bfa just comes out more and more ahead if you want to count the first raid and second raid.<br />
<br />
Uldir had 4, bod bad 4, both PvP seasons/warfonts had 8 each and then the 2 heritage sets.<br />
<br />
So that would be 26 compared to 16. Legion isn’t gonna win no matter how you do the numbers unless you try and claim that recolours are unique sets.<br />
<br />
Legion used the same sets for both raids and PvP and used the same sets for both nightmare and and night hold while bfa actually has unique sets for all of thoses things, there’s no comparison.</div></div><hr />

Exactly.<br />
<br />
Tier sets at least looked individually awesome.<br />

Meanwhile the BFD mail set only suits Shamans. Same with the Uldir one. It's ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

No meter what you try, everyone will still claim BFA is the worst expansion ever. Even if you have fact that proof that in some points they actually improbe. <br />
(comming from a hunter, some of the armor i got on BFA are better that the tier i got the past 11 years)<br />

<br />
your really bad at math aren't you? there are 4 alliance sets and 4 horde sets all of which have an updated version which would be the ones with more spikes/potions.<br />
<br />
unless of course you think theses are the same set.<br />
