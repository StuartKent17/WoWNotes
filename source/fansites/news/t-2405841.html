As the heroes of Azeroth prepare for war, they look to their in-game friends for help. Whether it’s leveling up for experience, gearing up for combat, or mounting up to explore Azeroth, World of Warcraft is best enjoyed in groups, however big or small. If you have guildmates, friends, or family who haven’t been seen in Azeroth for a while, let them know they can play for free this weekend! <br />

Upcoming Australian Dollar (AUD) Price Changes for Select World of Warcraft Services<br />
World of Warcraft is played in many regions around the world, and we regularly conduct reviews of the prices of our games and services in all currencies. From time to time, it’s necessary to make changes to certain pricing based on a variety of factors, including global and regional market conditions. Following a careful evaluation, we wanted to provide notice that we’ll soon be adjusting the Australian dollar (AUD) prices of some of the select services available for World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
The new AUD pricing, reflected in the table below, will go into effect on 26 June AEST. Subscription prices will not be affected.<br />
<br />
New Zealand dollar pricing will be unaffected by this price change, and players in New Zealand will continue to purchase digital game software, virtual items, subscriptions, and optional game services at the current NZD pricing.<br />
<br />
We know that people have a lot of options for entertainment, and we never take pricing adjustments such as this lightly. We appreciate that players choose to spend their time with World of Warcraft, and we’re committed to ensuring the game continues to provide Australian players with a great entertainment value. <br />

I'm not defending WoD but I've never seen so many people leave an expansion as I did in Legion. It really shocked me, it probably has nothing to do with the expansion itself but rather that the game is just plain old and you're doing the exact same thing you did over 10 years ago.

<br />
It’s nothing more than the natural progression of play styles and the game’s life. At 14 years old, not as many people play the game like a full time job every single day anymore. More and more people get in, see what they want, and then get out than before. It’s not that Legion sucked. That’s just a super convenient thing for you to say at the end of an expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My question as well. Further point to it: if I buy MULTIPLE race changes now can I stockpile them all up for Zandalari?<br />
<br />
Findings after testing it out:<br />
<br />
You can basically pre-purchase a race change on every character and let it sit there until the expansion hits and Zandalari are unlocked. This apparently worked for people waiting for Void Elves to release with 7.3.5, who purchased the transfers months ahead of time.</div></div><hr />

Much like the EU price changes, they were lower than USD so they changed them to be about equal. Are they too high for what they are? Probably, but as long as they have people paying that'll be the price, someone had to crunch the numbers to see what the best price would be.</div></div><hr />

No it's really not worth £19 rather than a few days of time. WoW is around £0.30 per day at most.<br />
<br />
It would have to take 2 months to level for the cost of your sub to even come close to the same as a character transfer. Nobody is that slow.<br />

Either BFA hasn't sold enough to meet the qouta or there needing more sub numbers to keepm investors happy. Honestly , to improve the game the launch needs to fail with low numbers in order to wake up the stockholders to push for a better change then whats occuring now. I've tried convincing friends to come back , only to be upset after buying legion and leaving . They felt like the money spent for legion was a waste and I don't blame them. I hope the numbers remain low because Ion and the other devs need to be taken down a couple notches.</div></div><hr />

Time has value in its own right. In the time you spend leveling, you could be riding a bike, staring at a wall or sticking a burning hot iron rod up your own arse. There are many things to do a th 24+ hours that are more fun than leveling a new character in wow today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it's really not worth £19 rather than a few days of time. WoW is around £0.30 per day at most.<br />
<br />
It would have to take 2 months to level for the cost of your sub to even come close to the same as a character transfer. Nobody is that slow.<br />

Ok and what's stopping you from making the same class on another server? Come 2 months your mains progress will be irrelevant anyway as you step into new content.<br />
<br />
Lets use non-gear related progression as an example, achievements are not completely account only, what if your almost maxed on reps (which is around 80) but want to go into BFA and achieve the 100 reps you would be shit out of luck... at the end of the day, services that cost blizzard very little shouldn't be the price they were originally and there is no GOOD reason but greed why they went up again.</div></div><hr />

They went up to match the USD base price. Like i said before, sure they're probably high for what they are, but since people pay that, they'll stay there. Blizz isn't dumb, they're going to charge what enough people will pay to make it worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For what it would take for the services, there is no probably that the prices are high but its true people pay it, having to pay what a new AAA title costs for 2 services is a joke eitherway.<br />
<br />
If anything, with their new system of PvP servers not existing anymore, a lot of players would like to leave low pop PvE realms here in OCE for the larger realms that would no longer be PvP(the majority of OCE players play on 2 servers which are both PvP currently) the price should be lowered, not increased to match.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or, perhaps, they'll be aiming for new sales out of the people that left a while back by offering them a free weekend? <br />
It'll make more sense to cut the pricetag on BfA if sales weren't great. Wouldn't it?<br />
<br />
As for the sales on services, that's just one big piñata to rake in a bunch of cash from people who had a service on their mind but thought it to be too expensive.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is a smart business. The free weekend and sales are making them heaps of money. If they where super desperate they wouldn't have made it a free weekend, they'd give you a free month or something.</div></div><hr />

To be fair if you have all the reps up you already have the rewards needed most likely.<br />

Allied races unlocks are account wide too.<br />

Time has value in its own right. In the time you spend leveling, you could be riding a bike, staring at a wall or sticking a burning hot iron rod up your own arse. There are many things to do a th 24+ hours that are more fun than leveling a new character in wow today.<br />
<br />
Still.<br />
<br />
It takes a few days at most to hit 110 in WoW.<br />
<br />
That is £1.20 over 4 days yes. Since WoW as I said averages around 30p a day.<br />
<br />
I can't fathom where £19 is more worthwhile. That is nearly 2 months worth of a sub.</div></div><hr />

Don't think its worth even turning on the PC for that. Maybe if they gave the latest xpac with like a month to try out it could be nice but Warcraft still looks stale and unfun to actually play for real again. No reason to be back since Wrath.</div></div><hr />

Wha? How many hours does it take you to lvl and how much do you get paid per hour. Thats the formula you should use, not in relation to sub price. Also add or subtract some depending on how much you like/hate working and how much you like/hate lvling.</div></div><hr />

Again. £19 is about 2 months sub.<br />

No way in hell it's taking you two months to level in this game.<br />

So no. If it takes you 2 months to level in this game then you are slow.</div></div><hr />

You keep using the monthly sub price as the metric, but why on earth would you do that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think he means &quot;buying off time played&quot; but indeed, that makes no sense.<br />
<br />
If it takes you 24hrs to level 1 - 110, those 24h should be pitted against your real life $/h rate. <br />
<br />
Say you make 25$ an hour, you actually &quot;save&quot; 22h * 25$ = 550$ of your real life valued time, by spending 50$ on a boost. An amount which you would earn back in just 2 hours of real work. <br />
<br />
Provided you consider leveling a chore/work of course rather than the entertainment value it represents. <br />
If you enjoy leveling, buying a boost is quite stupid. <br />
<br />
Personally, I've spent my time leveling in the past, and am now at a point in my life where fiddling in ~24 hours spread across 1-4 weeks of leveling is definitely worth the 50$ injection to immediately start playing at the &quot;level&quot; I want to play the game at. <br />
<br />
Been playing since '06 and have seen all the old zones the original way.</div></div><hr />
