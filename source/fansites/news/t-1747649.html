Bots and Hacks<br />
We tend to not discuss what we're doing in the fight against bots for the simple reason that any shred of information that goes out has the potential to hurt our efforts. Simply put, the safer botters (and bot-makers) feel, the more likely we are to catch them. Minutes count with these sorts of things. Using made-up numbers here, but just for illustration: a new detection method that catches 50 botters could have only been 5 (or none) if the botters had any reason to believe there might be something coming.<br />
<br />
I completely understand why that's a crappy response, but we have to use every single advantage we can get here, and that means being relatively quiet about an issue that's obviously very important -- both to the community, and to us.<br />
<br />
As to the question of &quot;player reporting vs Blizzard detection,&quot; that's not something we're taking an either/or response to. We're constantly working on improving our detection methods. That doesn't mean that player reports don't help.<br />
<br />
Can you make reporting players easier? The only option right now that I know of is to report them mid arena game which isn't always possible.<br />
We absolutely need to do better about getting this information out there, but the best method to report players you suspect are using a bot or hack -- especially if you can gather some video evidence -- is to email hacks@blizzard.com. That email address is monitored constantly by the team responsible for investigating such things.

That's because the faction rewards are stupid. Reskinned mounts with terrible animations, bland tabards, and some useless items. What's the point?<br />
<br />
Only the trading post mount is even remotely worth it, and that's if you're Alliance. Horde just gets another wolf.</div></div><hr />

Edit: Noticed that the lowest completed horde reps are frostwolf and laughing skull, you can easily grind 7k+ rep/hour with both. Frostwolf: AoE mind-frozen goren near Hoarfrost (don't kill him or they stop spawning), laughing skull get a group and go anti-clockwise around pit, cannon across to skip the east side and pick up the 2 types of buffs along the way for massive dmg buffs.</div></div><hr />

Just because it's easy doesn't mean it isn't needlessly long and boring. It's too monotonous for anyone to bother with it, especially when the rewards are subpar at best.</div></div><hr />

I have no reason to go out into the world, there's no sense of organization because there is no dailies. Garrison 'daily' is a mess. Grinding mobs for Apexis to grind mobs for rep to grind mobs for more Apexis to waste gold on recolored mounts. The mount rewards aren't even unique to the factions, the other rewards are meh. I have never felt so frustrated over an expansion before like I have with Warlords. I want to enjoy the zones and have a purpose to be out there but, I would rather sit in my Garrison doing nothing because I have no reason to go out. Grinding mobs is excessively boring and no amount of rep goodies will motivate me to work on reputations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I have 73 exalted reps atm (game is down and the armory is weird with how it lists them). I've been doing rep grinds since vanilla when it was nothing but a near endless grind to get some of the reps up. It may just be a personal thing with me to get them, but it's one of the things I enjoy doing in the game. It's obviously not for everyone, but that's why the game has many different aspects to it. There is generally something for everyone even though most people don't care about anything they don't want to do themselves.</div></div><hr />

Also I think the reason so few people are raising reputation in Warlords is because there are no useful gear rewards, at least one 640-650 Epic would have made them more popular, but then people would have complained that &quot;they are forced to grind rep for gear&quot;, I guess Blizzard wanted to avoid that. Rewards should be : Friendly - Low Level Gear (615), Honored - Toy, Revered - Follower &amp; Piece of Gear (640-650), Exalted - Tabard, Mount &amp; Pet + Cosmetic Item or a title if its relevant.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing the same bug that got me the first achievement for one exalted rep is skewing the results. I got that achievement when I logged onto my lvl 86 mage that had never even been to Draenor. This is before I had exalted with any draenor faction on any character.<br />
<br />
I'm not certain, but I think being Best Friend with Nat Pagle from MoP counts, as you can get him in the Garrison.</div></div><hr />

I actually randomly received the 'Savage Friends' achievement when logging in to an alt that was at lvl 20 or so, right after 6.0. That explains why it's at 40%+, when the actual factions added together are less than half that number. I still don't have a single one of the factions on exalted, but I haven't really tried.

For what it's worth I have one exalted rep and that is because i pooled all the tokens from missions and used them on one alt.<br />

There are no significant rewards from factions since we &quot;didn't want items locked behind dailies&quot;, so now factions are as optional as we wanted in 5.0<br />
<br />
I.e completely irrelevant.<br />

<br />
There should be DEEP optional L100 quest chains (not dailies) that take you to at least 1/2 way through Revered, followed by whatever mechanism for Exalted. Group quest dailies, tabards for rep gain in dungeons/raids, Crafting faction &quot;supplies&quot;, etc. Just make most of it story driven.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soeroah</div><div class="date">2015-03-31, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have all 5 of the reps at exalted. None of them were very difficult to do and I really don't mind the grind to get them, I actually kinda enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
I think I have 73 exalted reps atm (game is down and the armory is weird with how it lists them). I've been doing rep grinds since vanilla when it was nothing but a near endless grind to get some of the reps up. It may just be a personal thing with me to get them, but it's one of the things I enjoy doing in the game. It's obviously not for everyone, but that's why the game has many different aspects to it. There is generally something for everyone even though most people don't care about anything they don't want to do themselves.<br />
<br />
That's nice and all, but as someone with 23,800 dailies completed on my Death Knight, I feel that WoD's approach to reputations completely removed any kind of grind I actually found fun and replaced it with 'gameplay' the Timeless Isle conditioned me to associate with wasted time and anger. The thought of going back to TI or trying to spend longer than 10 minutes grinding rep in WoD actually makes me feel pissed off.<br />
<br />
I don't see why they had to remove dailies as a reputation tool when they got rid of the issue people had with them in MoP - that they were 'mandatory' for raiders. For three expansions there was no vocal outcry about dailies and reputation, apart from people wanting to be able to Champion the reputations. MoP puts raid gear behind reputation while simultaneously making dailies the only way to gain that rep, people complain about the gear being gated so Blizzard undoes that terrible decision, then makes another one by using dailies as a scapegoat?<br />
<br />
<br />
Why can't we have both? Why can't we have a choice once a day between the rep grind as it currently is in WoD, or a set of five or so dailies that reward 250 rep a piece and you can't get rep from killing mobs? That way we can choose between gated but efficient, or non-gated and possible to do in one day. Better yet, bring in the other four ways MoP had to gain reputation.<br />
<br />
Personally I think it says something that I'd prefer to level hundreds of battle pets to level 25 than to try getting reputations I WANT to get to exalted over and done with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In all seriousness reputations are something that goes in the &quot;What WoD did wrong&quot; category. There so many tools they could use for rep: dungeons, scenarios, dailies yet they chose to go back to old school grind. Perhaps another aspect of this expansion that didn't make deadline?</div></div><hr />

&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;As to the question of &quot;player reporting vs Blizzard detection,&quot; that's not something we're taking an either/or response to. We're constantly working on improving our detection methods. That doesn't mean that player reports don't help.<br />
<br />
Can you make reporting players easier? The only option right now that I know of is to report them mid arena game which isn't always possible.<br />
We absolutely need to do better about getting this information out there, but the best method to report players you suspect are using a bot or hack -- especially if you can gather some video evidence -- is to email hacks@blizzard.com. That email address is monitored constantly by the team responsible for investigating such things. (Blue Tracker / Official Forums)&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Are u kidding me? So ur saying that im gonna put time and make your job Blizz? Are you serious? Its like im gonna go into a restaurnag and order a Pizza and pay for it then go myself info the kitchen and make the pizza myself? NO...no fucking way. I PAY YOU TO MAKE YOUR JOB. Why the hell we gonna give u Video evidence on someone who is booting - put time to download a video recorder program and install it and learn how to use and then record and send the file? Im gonna put that important time on just to report 1 fucking bot? Hell no. You guys just did confirm that your &quot;Right Click - Report Player&quot; aint working as intended and now WE GONNA send a video to prove. NO. I can give u a fucking ide instead. Put a damn future on the game so when you report a guy u gonna have a option to record 30-60 sec video ingame and just send it to you (Blizzard) directly. That would be 100000% better and easier for us. AND if it happens that the guy is a really boter and u perma ban him, WE SHOULD GET REWARDED (more days on game time maybe) for helping you. You are not giving us the game for free so why the hell we gonna give u something free. Well thats my opinion. And i cant reply this on US server so i just did write it here.

Difference is that rep was there to exist as a grind. The WoD feel as 'mandatory' to collection-focused players as MoP's did to raiders.<br />

If the reps didn't have any items on them there'd be a lot less grief about them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually you can somewhat simulate it. I've come up with a method of *slowly* gaining rep by just running into the appropriate zone and killing all the Rare spawns, then leaving for the day. This especially works well in Magnarok where four of the rare spawns give 450 rep from killing them (although two of them hit like trucks)<br />

Stats don't speak very well of Blizzard's design for reputations for WoD. Of course, there are no head enchants or recipes to grind for from rep vendors, so that's probably skewing perception.<br />
<br />
If they kept rewards the same and simply added dailys to get rep, I would have EXd all of them by now.<br />

They just need to buff the reputation from each kill. Double or triple what they are now.<br />
<br />
No, they need to scrap the lazy &quot;kill mobs for no reason&quot; grind. MoP was perfect in terms of reputation, fun quests cool, unfolding story lines. The only issue is they gated gear behind them, remove the gear and MoP was the best rep system ever.</div></div><hr />

I don't see why they don't add a faction reward to the Apexis daily/Scouting Missives (or maybe not the missives to prevent 1 day farming if that's what they want) to give 250 or 500 rep. Not a massive amount, but over time adds up.</div></div><hr />

Even here countless people complained about being artificially slowed down in terms of gaining rep because of dailies. Blizzard apparently listened and now it's getting clearer that either those people were just the minority or didn't know what they would get themselves into.</div></div><hr />

Some of you clearly have no idea what classic reps were like, and no I don't mean when you ran back at 80+ merrily AoEing everything down with one shots.<br />
<br />
If anything, WoD reps are the closest to classic in a looooong time. Even then, the fact that you go through the majority of those grinds via questing is easier than classic.</div></div><hr />

You make it sound like that's a good thing. The reputation grind in this expansion has been so stupidly ludicrous that it isn't even worth bothering with just for a bunch of recolored mounts with unfinished running animations.</div></div><hr />

If the reputation areas had dynamic content, it could make reputation grinding interesting. <br />
<br />
Steamwheedle was fun since there was a variety of ways you can complete it. They need to do it that way for all the reputations.</div></div><hr />

In what way was a reversion to Vanilla rep systems a good thing? Epic gear was also absurdly difficult to acquire and leveling from 1-60 took probably twice as long as it now takes to get from 1-100.<br />
<br />
Reputations are pointless if their rewards are meaningless. For the most part, unless you are a collector of pets or mounts these reps are meaningless. In terms of mounts, the mounts offered aren't even particularly appealing mounts. Comparatively, Shaohao rep was worth the grind because the mount was beautiful.<br />

This was a common bug early on. I logged in and got it on one of my characters in like the first month of WoD. Still don't have a single rep on any of my characters actually at exalted but I have the achievement...</div></div><hr />
