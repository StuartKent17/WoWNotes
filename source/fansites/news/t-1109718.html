Cooking<br />
Cooking Changes<br />
So you might have heard for Cooking in Mists of Pandaria we will have specializations. At the moment we're looking at around 5 branches of cooking, for example: broiling, steaming...etc.<br />
<br />
Each of these specializations will focus on a particular stat. So let's say the Steaming specialization allows you to create Agility food. A rogue would find that very interesting, and would probably want to max that one out first. At which point, said rogue would be able to create Agility buff feasts for groups. Cool, huh? But worry not, once you max out in one specialization, you can then work on the other specializations.<br />
<br />
Maybe they're gonna make it take ages to fully train all of them.<br />
Well, maybe not ages. But it does mean that until enough time passes for you to train all specializations, you need to—er—specialize. Actually it's the way for other crafting professions too. For example, my jewelcrafter specialized in spell related stat recipes first, since of all my multitude of alts, I prefer my casters. Eventually, of course, she learned many more recipes and of course so did other crafters, so the market changed.

Guardian Druid Feedback<br />
1) Bear damage in beta is currently too low. That is almost certainly the cause of any threat problems. It isn't anything you're doing wrong.<br />
<br />
2) Tanks got gibbed for missing Shield Blocks back when bosses could perform crushing blows (and back when warriors were designed to be the only tank). Mechanics work very differently today. We want bears, and all tanks, to have more control over their own survivability because threat isn't really that hard to maintain once #1 is fixed. You still have emergency buttons for when things go wrong or when you know big attacks are going to land. However we didn't think a tanking model designed around using long cooldowns and standing around the rest of the time would be very fun. So the new design is that using your attacks skillfully will give you some mitigation, in this case Savage Defense. It's not often going to save your life and fumbling it isn't likely to get you killed, but if you play well, your healers may notice and say &quot;Wow, you require less healing than many tanks I run with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Think of it this way:<br />
<br />
Beginner tank - can maintain threat. Probably 100% reliant on healers to stay alive.<br />
Intermediate tank - can maintain threat. Skilled at using long cooldowns to live.<br />
Advanced tank - can maintain threat. Skilled at using long cooldowns to live. Skilled at using short cooldowns to save healer mana and otherwise make things go smoother.<br />
<br />
More skilled tanks also know more encounter specifics, such as when adds are coming, when to interrupt spells, when to move bosses and so forth. <br />
<br />
Maul is a DPS alternative to Savage Defense, and is comparable to Heroic Strike. You shouldn't need Maul to maintain threat (which as I said above may not be the case on beta right now, but that's the intent).<br />
<br />
In what situations would you want DPS instead of mitigation? There are several: Maybe you're an off tank and taking little damage. Maybe you want to solo as Guardian. Maybe you're running a dungeon you out-gear. Maybe a new add just arrived, and it's important to get one swing in before it heads to the healer, assuming you can live without SD for a few seconds. (In that example, you're not spamming Maul to fight to maintain threat; you're just establishing initial aggro, which we still want in the game.)<br />
<br />
To be honest, we considered pulling Heroic Strike and Maul from tanks, just because we thought they might be a trap. But we decided there were enough situations where more DPS might be desirable. To use my previous examples, inexperienced tank will use Maul too much. Intermediate tanks might forsake Maul altogether. But expert tanks will know when they should use it.<br />
<br />
You can try to keep up Savage Defense as much as you can on challenging content, and the best tanks will, but I would still consider when to use it. I would not save it for a big boss smash that isn't going to land for 20 more seconds (because chances are you can use it now and then later), but if one was going to land in 8 seconds, it might be worth holding Savage Defense for then.

<br />
Seeing the profession items really has me wishing for an item squish, though. These numbers are getting rediculous, to the point where you actually have to count the zero's to check how effective something will be. I hope that more people will realize this now and that Blizzard picks up the signal in time to decide to have an item squish after all. I doubt it will happen (maybe the majority doesn't really care), but one can hope...</div></div><hr />

Most of those level 90 foods give you 300,000 HP and Mana. Judging by every past food, they won't fill you completely up, so I think we're looking at half a million health pools. That crunch really needs to happen and soon with insanity like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to mention same old boring scopes as well.<br />
<br />
Enchant Weapon - Windsong - Permanently enchants a melee weapon to sometimes increase your critical strike, haste, or mastery rating by 1,500 for 12 sec<br />
when dealing damage with spells and melee attacks.<br />
<br />
Enchant Weapon - Dancing Steel - Permanently enchants a melee weapon to sometimes increase your Strength or Agility by 1,650 when dealing melee damage.<br />
Your highest stat is always chosen.<br />
<br />
Mirror Scope - : Permanently attaches a mirrored scope to a ranged weapon, sometimes increases critical strike rating by 400 for 10 sec when dealing damage with ranged attacks<br />
Lord Blastington's Scope of Doom - Permanently attaches Lord Blastington's special scope to a ranged weapon, sometimes increases Agility by 200 for 10 sec when dealing damage with ranged attacks.<br />
<br />
of course we don't know the proc rate yet but still &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, I wouldn't hold your breath. While we can always be hopeful, the general fodder listed is basically what engineers got when Cata came out... other than that there were a few less than useful tinkers (a damage absorption shield that has a chance to get you one-shotted? Brilliant,) a pet, the synapse springs (who's CD is shared with on-use trinkets,) the electrostatic condenser, the helmets that were good until you actually started raiding, and a few lackluster gadgets (anyone mind telling me what the hell the gnomish gravity well was supposed to be?) <br />
<br />
Honestly, blizzard seems to just be dragging their feet with engineering... while I get it's not exactly supposed to be a money making venture, it's supposed to at least be... well, FUN... With each new patch the other professions get multitudes of new crafting patterns... Blizzard just seems content to stick in a new scope or a gun who's mat costs is less than it's actual AH price and call it a done deal. Even a few fun gag items would be a nice gesture.</div></div><hr />

Battlegrounds, indoor areas like outdoor raids and outdoor dungeons, mount collectors. If anything, why not a ground mount? The only reason to have a flying mount is to either show it off while afking in the main city, or flying to a raid to summon first.</div></div><hr />

I think someone misunderstood spell definition when data mining. Greater mysterious essence cannot be crafted from 2 lesser ones. Note that the spell is instant (no cast time), no crafting recipe has 0 cast time. I'm only guessing but aren't those &quot;crafting&quot; spells linked, simply the effects of right-clicking the item? Meaning that you need 2 more essences apart from the one you are clicking = 3 essences in total.<br />
<br />
Also note that the recipe for Spirit Dust -&gt; lesser Mysterious Essence has cast time. If those spells were checked more thoroughly I guess it would also be revealed that they have no profession skill requirement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or that the essence converts just as it did or with even less than in previous expansions, but converting soul dust into essence can only be done by enchanters and is therefore a spell in their spellbook. Meaning anyone can turn greater into lesser and vice-versa, but only an enchanter can convert dust into lessers so they can manage materials more easily after disenchanting.</div></div><hr />

Am I the only one who noticed the strangeness within this part? You can craft the higher mats from lower mats now...but it costs less than normal? Example: You can make one Greater Mysterious Essence from Lesser Mysterious Essence x2 by crafting, or if you were to go the normal way of clicking on it, it will cost you 3 of the Lessers according to the tool-tip posted. It's the same way with the Ethereal Shard/Small Ethereal Shard tool-tips. Am I missing something here? Or is it really going to be better to &quot;craft&quot; it however that happens rather than make it the normal route?

It's probably the same way as WoWhead handles Eternal Life/Shadow/etc (http://www.wowhead.com/item=35625#created-by-spell) in that it only shows the reagents you need IN ADDITION to the one you just clicked. Sorry, no infinite mats here ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Other than scopes are there any enchants for ranged weapons? Also, any new LW information?<br />
<br />
When have they last implemented ranged enchants other than scopes? I don't expect them to do so now.<br />
Also, these weapon enchants, to me, are rather underwhelming. I like my tank to have a flat damage reduction enchant, not some uncontrollable proc. But hey, atleast there's choices. Rather alot for tanks imo. Windsong seems underwhelming, but Dancing Steel, Colossus and Flowing River may all turn out to be viable.<br />
They'd better made windsong cheap or shorter ICD though, cos 1500 of a secondary stat or 1650 of a primary, well yeah. Or the numbers will have to change. Also, secondary stats are often more of a juggle, where you gear for a haste breakpoint and then want more crit/mastery. What if this enchant decides to choose your highest stat, which could well be haste?<br />
And for healers, it's really just Jade Spirit (the bonus spirit effect sounds nice to me).<br />
<br />
On second thought, with the numbers on Colossus and Elemental Force, they must proc more often than the other enchants. Which makes those the more interesting/fun ones to my taste. Perhaps Colossus looks more like the flat damage reduction enchant than I had first thought. We'll have to see procrates.<br />
<br />
And on a different point, I now wish that I had inscription on my druid instead of on my shaman. OffHands which aren't shields? No thank you. Those staffs are perfect for druids (as well as for monks probably, although a spiritless staff seems better for balance than for healers.) And I still don't know whether my buying all of those books of glyph mastery lately in an effort to know all glyphs for MoP was a good idea. (not done yet though)</div></div><hr />

Brilliant,) a pet, the synapse springs (who's CD is shared with on-use trinkets,) the electrostatic condenser, the helmets that were good until you actually started raiding, and a few lackluster gadgets (anyone mind telling me what the hell the gnomish gravity well was supposed to be?) <br />

Honestly, blizzard seems to just be dragging their feet with engineering... while I get it's not exactly supposed to be a money making venture, it's supposed to at least be... well, FUN... With each new patch the other professions get multitudes of new crafting patterns... Blizzard just seems content to stick in a new scope or a gun who's mat costs is less than it's actual AH price and call it a done deal. Even a few fun gag items would be a nice gesture.<br />

Well I think the weapon enchants will be also applicable to bows. Considering that bows will become primary weapon for hunters and not just ranged weapon. So scopes will be a bonus for engineers as a profession perk. That's how I see it.</div></div><hr />

Example: You can make one Greater Mysterious Essence from Lesser Mysterious Essence x2 by crafting, or if you were to go the normal way of clicking on it, it will cost you 3 of the Lessers according to the tool-tip posted. It's the same way with the Ethereal Shard/Small Ethereal Shard tool-tips. Am I missing something here? Or is it really going to be better to &quot;craft&quot; it however that happens rather than make it the normal route?

<br />
Already answered in this thread. It is because 1 of them is a spell and one is an item-click. The reason it only uses ´2´ is because you click on 1 to start the process. So it still takes 3. There are a lot of this type of thing on wowhead where a spell seems to take 1 less than what you would think.. it is because you trigger the spell on 1 of the items.</div></div><hr />

The really curious thing is inscription. I find it hard to believe that the devs would ´screw´ non-casters like that. Either they have to be BOE, or they have to add all the weapons.. otherwise a crapload of people are going to have to change professions. It is also curious that the AGI staff IS boe and all the others are bop.<br />
<br />
But yeah, this is early beta.. don´t get upset about numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's probably more likely those new recipes are going to replace the existing &quot;Enchant Cloak - Spell Resistance&quot; enchants that are already in the game. Since they are removing spell resistance and converting resist racials to a flat damage reduction, they either need to just delete the resistance enchants or change them.</div></div><hr />

That's not the point, unfortunately. From what we have seen now and I understand that you are saying it is not complete, we have seen the structural heart of professions for MOP. And it's exactly the same as Cata. Which was exactly the same as WOTLK. Which was the same as TBC. The names change but not much else. It's quite unbelievable and very lazy, needs a rethink. So for me, and perhaps many others I have simply had enough of this. There is no innovation whatsoever. And alas this mirrors much of what we have seen with MOP so far, it's prettyish but we've seen it all before and not enough substance. Of course the good news is that addictions are being killed by the persons that created them in the first place, so it's not all bad.<br />

Agreed.<br />
<br />
There is no reason they couldn't make the gems for secondary stats have more of that stat than the primary, or they could create set bonuses of secondary stats that would require a little thought. To use Cata as an example, if set bonuses for secondary stats were 40 or 50 rather than 20, it would make the decision making of how to gem for min/maxing a lot more interesting.</div></div><hr />

this would mean anyone being a panda race would get an extra 300+ in a stat by food buff how is that NOT overpowered at all? idk about you but an extra 300agi or int on my shaman would be great and overepowered<br />

Same old boring profession formula as the past 2 and a half expansions, just with more vanity items. Meh. Professions remain the least utilized and interactive part of WoW character development.<br />

It's 100% MORE of a stat. No matter what number someone else has, Panda's get double. It's called logic. You know, that thing some posters have none of?</div></div><hr />

You guys have a profession mount AND another mount. The JC mount is very meh if you ask me - i wonder what it offers in terms of utility. I really hope it offers something other then a ground mount. Atleast the mechano and sandstone drake sit two people. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind another mount that repairs like that elephant but with updated vendors - maybe blacksmith will get something like that. It doesn't matter really i have most professions maxed out and we are getting mounts to be boa (eventually).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but the numbers are obviously not correct, and for the past 5 years they have been anally retentive about having numbers at an almost predictable level. I am pretty sure anyone with half a brain could figure out almost exactly what the gems, rare gems etc will be. The devs almost never go outside the range for stats of things like that. (it is almost boring how predictable they are). There just is no sense talking about the actual numbers on items now because they are obviously wrong... and they will almost certainly be exactly what you would expect them to be.<br />
<br />
We are better of talking about other ´strange´ things... like inscribers only being able to make BOP staffs and off-hands which screws any non-caster who happened to have inscription.... and also the fact that they are epic items.. while engineer hats are now blue. Are those issues WAI?</div></div><hr />

People also often cite the parachute cloak, nitro boosts, Jeeves, and their popularity.<br />
<br />
But here's the thing... the &quot;exclusive&quot; mounts... the &quot;powerful&quot; tinkers... they've been in the game for near FIVE YEARS now. In almost the exact same iteration, save for the occasional patch making them more deadly to the engineer actually using them. Blacksmiths, inscriptionits, jewelcrafters, tailors, alchemists... ALL of them get new items (more often than not GOOD items) to make with almost every raiding patch that comes out, with the potential to make a fair deal of money with it. What do engineers get? We get the occasional non-competitive gun and/or a scope who's mats cost more than the actual sell price of the item itself on the AH. <br />
<br />
While it's just Beta, Blizzards recent (and ongoing) disregard for the engineering profession doesn't give me high hopes for any fun additions in the future. Hell, they've been giving more &quot;gag&quot; items to other professions than engineering, and the other professions can actually sell theirs.</div></div><hr />

No, it's 300 stats with level 90 food. Were food buffs huge DPS buffs in Cata? No? Then, why the hell would they be huge DPS buffs in MoP?<br />
<br />
90 Agi (at 85 of course) is 200 DPS over the racial benefits of an Orc, to a HT12 BiS mathematically perfect hunter. Overall, that is a .24% performance increase in a mathematically perfect environment. It is next to nothing at Cata levels, and, since Blizzard has done the math, will be next to nothing over other racial benefits for MoP levels.</div></div><hr />

Mostly due to the stats simplification.<br />
We no longer have penetration, defense rating, freedom, resistance... well almost everything. <br />
But yes, it is just plain boring everything is just an &quot;upgrade&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Not only did they not announce anything for us, we don't have enough people left in the profession to complain about how it's been, how it is, or how it will be. We still don't have any mounts. We have no income source except selling leather from skinning to other leatherworkers... <br />
<br />
I only hope the lack of news on our poor profession is because they're finally going to give us an overhaul of epic proportion.<br />
<br />
I recommended these suggestions this time last year for LW Mounts: Canoe, Hang-glider (I am hoping this has translated to those FP Kites), and/or Wings. These would be made from leather, hide, feathers, and maybe lightweight bones you collect from animal corpses. Certainly sounds more feasible than JC and alchemy mounts once did. And I don't care if they're BoE or BoP to profession, as long as i get to play icarus in the sun with my feathery, magically-enchanted wings sprouting from a backpack.<br />
<br />
Ideas for income: Bring back Drums in a major way. Theyd be a new battle commodity like funtions are now but offer utility over stat increase - Speed increase, ability to jump higher or farther, even drums to craft faster, drums to heal. They would work like potions where they work for a limited time and can't be cast again until combat ends but they would affect whole group (raid/party). Also, the mounts I suggested earlier. And include leather in other professions. Skinning is the only gathering profession to supply only 1 crafting profession and it's killing us.</div></div><hr />
