In our next major content patch, druids will find a host of new textures for two major forms, cat and bear. There will be five different designs for each of these forms for the Horde and Alliance. Night elves can choose to change their cat and bear look at any time by visiting the barber shop and changing their character's hair color, while tauren will be able to change which look they use by switching skin tones in the barber shop -- a new feature for tauren in the next major content patch. Given that there are more hair colors and skin tones than unique form looks, some colors and tones will overlap with these new textures. The hair and skin colors chosen will, in most cases, correspond with the color seen in the look of each form. Some similar colors that may share a particular cat texture will not necessarily share the same bear texture.<br />
<br />
We'd like to share with you this new art for each form and faction in four installments. So without further ado, our first preview is for the five new textures of the tauren druid bear form. We'll also show the current form design so you can easily see the extra detail and textures of the new art. Work continues on new looks for the remaining druid forms and we hope to add them in future content patches. <br />

I mean what if you like a certain Tauren fur colour however that is linked to a Bear/cat texture you don't like.<br />
<br />
Also I really really do hope they have textures that change Tauren cat form big time, not just colours.</div></div><hr />

Though I guess it is cool that all will be able to change their fur and hair colors for their &quot;human form&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I hope the NE also get a polar version. I want to match the baby blizzard bear! ;D<br />
<br />
I am surprised that they're not talking of a change for the trees. I can understand the boomkins being pushed back slightly since you kinda tell the difference with the weapons (up until everyone gets the same ones...).<br />

<br />

They're not placeholders, read the post. We waited 5 fucking years to get a form that changes with our gear, countless thousands of suggestions from the community on how this could work, we were told time and time again, they're coming, they're being developed, you won't be disappointed, and after 5 years we get virtually the same model, with an option to change hair colour?

<br />
Why don't you try keeping the same fucking gear look that you had on your level 10 character for 5 years or so and see how you feel. Are you telling me that even if the stats upgraded you'd be totally cool with staring at exactly...the...same...thing... for 5 years? Try developing an iota of understanding before you start calling people ungrateful QQers. We've been waiting a long time for this. We were EXTREMELY patient. Then FINALLY, all we got are re-skins that probably took a few weeks to develop. Brilliant.</div></div><hr />

So for all the retards crying about tree and boomkin skins maybe read before you cry? and what new models can they make, maybe instead of whinging over new textures you can give some suggestions? a kitten? a panda? maybe a siamese cat for cat form? there isn't much you can do with the models and the textures are amazing and a start, nobody said they worked on these for 5 years or 2 years but fact is they planned druid changes and here they are.<br />
<br />
Problem with WOW is, you get the people that are happy with changes, you get the people that will still use the new textures but need to whine about EVERYTHING and then ou get the people who just whine whine and whine some more, with WOW you will never please enough people so at the end of the day if you don't like these changes then just don't use them, pretty simple isn't it?<br />

I actually think its cool how they implemented it without having to make a HUUUUGE content patch, no one understands how much work even skinning is (and yes it is an updated model as well because of the jewelry). Anyone who is complaining has no reason to, go learn 3D game design and come back and then you can complain. especially when they only have about 20 modelers on staff (many of witch are dedicated to making more PvE content). I do All kinds of development (Including 3D Modeling and Animation) I know how long the shit takes.</div></div><hr />

I won't quote your whole post. But I will refer again to the Druids of Azeroth skinpack. I'm not encouraging anyone to use it by any means, but at least look at the pics. It's a single guy doing that, and Blizz definitely has more than 1 person working on it.<br />
<br />
Yes, that stuff isn't easy. But c'mon, they're not 3rd graders or even fresh out of their modeling school or something.<br />
<br />
Now, @anyone going &quot;Wow nubz what kind of new models you want, a cat is a cat lolololol&quot;<br />
Use some grey matter. Look at the Horde cat form and the Alliance cat form. So very different, yet, they're both cats. I'll let you ponder that one for a while. Try not to nosebleed though.</div></div><hr />

I Understand where you are coming from, I mean I hate tauren cat form to no ends. But in a development environment you sometimes have to go really fast. Remaking multiple forms for one class and doing each of their skeletons/models and making the animation for each would take a long time. Next expansion they will likely actually change the models, but for now its more of a bone throw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Early release was because of content demand, they only wanted to release it in January or later. Lots of QQ made them release it early hence why DK were so OP at the beginning after about 15 nerfs in the beta they were still OP at release and Paladin. Hopefully next expansion they don't have another 50 million QQ's So they can balance PvP and PvE before release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, read the post - all forms are being updated. Stop the QQ: 'NOOO WHAT ABOUT MY FORM!? QQ BILZZ HATEZ TREEZ'<br />
<br />
Second, look at the screenshot. The bottom middle bear is the old bear form, the rest are all new. Examine them. YES! That's right! Two seconds of staring told me what I already knew, it's a brand new model, which means new animations, more detail, and better textures! Stop the QQ 'LAME JUST NEW TEXTURES QQ F U BLZZRD'<br />
<br />
Thirdly, the graphic team should be hard at work on new raids, dungeons, and the next expansion. Rigging up a new model takes TIME. At least, it does if you want to make it anywhere near to halfway decent. Time that they spend giving us new raids and instances.<br />
<br />
Finally, there are multiple dev teams for things such as graphics and mechanics - just because they've decided to make updated druid forms does not mean that they are ignoring other important issues. Astonishingly, Blizzard, as a multi-mega-million-dollar corporation, has the ability to split its attention and divide its workload, an amazing skill some of the forum goes ought to look into.<br />
<br />
<br />
...P.S., awesome new forms are awesome, this makes me actually want to PLAY a druid, which I imagine is precisely the reaction Blizz is hoping to get, being as druids are indeed one of the least played classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why don't you try starting with:<br />
http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=8041754652&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=1<br />
<br />
You know, the 38 page thread that is VERSION THREE of the Druid forms discussion. That's over a hundred pages of discussion about new forms, excluding the several similar 40-page threads on the US forums. Creative, interesting, fun suggestions (along with admittedly a lot of 'why haven't we got new forms yet' qq) on how to implement the changes. For god's sake, like someone else posted, Druids have even gone to the trouble of designing new textures as an illustration of what might be good to see. Just because you're too small-minded to think of some other options for various forms doesn't mean the rest of the Druid community is too. For a start, refer to:<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae<br />
<br />
How many cat forms could they do? I dunno, how about for a start: Mountain cat, Leopard, Panther, Lion, Puma, Lynx, Caracal, Snow Leopard, Tiger, Jaguar? Lack of imagination is not the problem (although it's a problem you seem to have). The fact is they've just bailed on putting a significant amount of effort into the primary issue, which is having forms scale with gear, in the same way as every other character's looks scale with gear. We've waited a long time for this. <br />
<br />
There's a post on the US forums from a Blue saying &quot;We also would like to allow gear to affect the visual look of the forms, but this too is something that is going to need additional work in order to get it to work properly and look good.&quot; No offense, but you've been promising us this for at least 2-3 years. We've been asking for it for 4-5. To say 'we need extra time to look at this' just basically means they've been putting zero effort into it and decided they had to come up with a few new models (for feral only!) to try and placate the Druid community for another year. It's BS.</div></div><hr />

Tree and moonkin forms scheduled for at least another patch (that would make icecrown at the very least, it seems); no variation based on sex, no change with levels and/or equipment and poor method of customization (since all forms are based on the caster form hair or skin tone, chances are that you'll be stuck with some crappy skin on some of your forms) So, after so many years waiting for this is underestandable that many are a bit dissapointed as this is nearly the bare minimum they could do. I mean, if they did less they would be doing nothing at all.<br />
<br />
Some people mentioned that these things take time and druid forms are not a priority, new content is. Well, they constantly add new crap that few people see (like pets and mounts from cards) and there are tons of stuff that play a very small role; as an example, the (very cool) model of the murloc's costume that only appears in a short and inconsequential quest chain in coldarra, complete with it's own dance. I mean, the freaking costume is like 100 times better that the tauren cat form (not a great feat though), and they told us that animating an entirely new dance was SO HARD AND TIME CONSUMING LOL. Also we all know about the guy (guys?) that did in his (their?) spare time art upgrades for ALL forms that looked even better than the preview we've seen. So I'm not buying the &quot;it takes so much work&quot; argument.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They are actually new models. Higher polycount, added doodads, and reworking of the feet and mouth. It's not a simple skin swap.<br />
<br />
On a side note, the only time the mouth will close is when you are in the sitting animation. This means bears in idle will still have open mouths. How often do ferals sit down? *sighs*<br />
<br />
Good progress though. The bears look light years ahead of what we have now. I'm disappointed however that the regular bear and dire bear forms will still be the same. I think the level 10 form should be the current one and the dire bear form be the new &quot;customizable&quot; forms.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why people are complaining about the link between hair/fur color and your form's color. It makes sense for a black tauren to turn into a black bear. Granted, the stuff in WoW rarely has any sense of realism attached to it.<br />
<br />
I do hope they change Boomchicken and tree form. Even if they are just slightly different doodads or hues. Just because I'm a tauren doesn't mean I want all my forms to be shades of brown. :(</div></div><hr />

On a side note, the only time the mouth will close is when you are in the sitting animation. This means bears in idle will still have open mouths. How often do ferals sit down? *sighs*<br />
<br />
<br />
This is not correct. It was clarified, again in the link from above. By saying &quot;sitting around&quot; the blue more intended &quot;idleing&quot;. It was a fairly common misconception, but was later cleared up, so thanks for at least looking at the rest of the source :)</div></div><hr />

Most...not all...of those skins will be less silly than our current skins but at least our mouths will shut now :P<br />

A few things:<br />
<br />
-you have not been asking for new models for 4 years. If you didn't like druid models when the game came out, you wouldn't have made a druid (unless, of course, you're retarded)<br />
<br />
-who is to say that the only models they're adding are for ferals. I didn't read the tread, but even if they directly said that they're only doing Feral forms doesn't mean that's all they're doing. They like to watch you guys cry as much as everybody else does.<br />
<br />
-you need new eyes if you think all they did was switch the color palates for these bears.<br />
<br />
-Andridge (sp?) models are cool, but they aren't what bliz intended their forms to look like.<br />
<br />
-what else would they do other than add polys, change some features and change some colors? Would you honestly prefer if your bear was wearing a little leather helmet and cloak while tanking?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

1. Warlocks: They do more dmg than mages, they have dots, and loads of fear. They can easily burst for 15 k when ur feared and there pet can spel lock u even if u silence the lock Gj :S. How do u even imagine that is balanced? <br />
<br />
2. Resto Druids. Where should i start? As pretty much every class, if the druid got to much resi and + healing. U cant kill him. when finally hes oom. then inervate and hes full on mana in 2 sec. They can cyclone, The only cc u cant dispel, break out or anything. Again how do u think thats ballanced?<br />
<br />
3. Retri pallys. I dont know if u guys at blizzard even play this game, but if u put a resto druid and a retri pally together in 2v2, u cant do a damn thing. Maybe thats why most of the high teams is that setup. Maybe u should actually try play this game before u buffing classes. <br />

Naturally people QQ a river over anything and everything, even something that's been demanded for years. Give them what they want, they want more or what they get isn't good enough (never is).<br />
<br />
As to the rest of the QQ, this is about Druid skins, not about your assumption that druids need a nerf or your class needs more loving. This has been years in the making, everyone's gotten something over the years and it's high time they delivered on the promise for new form skins (like a ton of other things, missing from the WOTLK launch). Other than the Flight skin, we've been given crap for skin upgrades since we got them.<br />
<br />
I'll reserve judgement for how well I think they look until I actually see them in game. I don't like the idea of having to reskin my Tauren self but I'm also not going to make a big deal about it either. I'll be happy to at least look moderately unique than every other Druid out there when in a feral form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, we have been staring at the same skin for the past 4 years, yes it has been painful on the eyes, yes it has been frustrating as guildies strut around us in thier fancy new gear, as we sit there and look the same after a complete gear revamp, but what people are failing to see is this is not a half assed solution which took 5 minutes to concieve, you should be HAPPY that our persistance has paid off at last.<br />
<br />
Too all those who are considering this a simple slap on texture, kindly take the glasses off your face, clean them of the accumulated filth and take a closer look. Compared with the old bear form, you just have to look at the ragged edges of the old model and glance at the sleek new skin to realise that these new models carry at least 4 TIMES the number of polygons used on the old bear model, and they have quite likely followed in the trend of all current wrath content and upgraded to Tri-polygons (This is the reason for smoother models and edges in wrath for those less fammiliar with these terms, like half the trolls in this topic)<br />
<br />
So please shut your mouth's (wait, we cant yet, but they have kindly given us the ability to do that too) and stop abusing the Dev team who in my opinion have done (so-far) a great job with a difficult task. Now give the Owls and plantlife some love and everyone will be happy (Except the guy mentioning hunter PvP on the first page, he can die in a fire)</div></div><hr />

Fancy how its the non Druids who think they are cool<br />
<br />
These are pointless and a temporary stall at best<br />
The reason Druid forms got boring was because they didnt look any different no matter what gear youre in<br />
So when everyone else gets to enjoy new equipment models all the time the Druids stuck looking at the same thing<br />
Of course now we get to cycle through looking at the same model that just different colors<br />
<br />
This would be a fine solution if they put this togethor in 2 weeks while they worked on a major rework, but this has been years coming<br />
And these will just get dull after a short while anyway. Might as well have not done anything so we could pretend they are just taking time to do something impressive</div></div><hr />

And something totally new for the bear form, but that's not the way devs decided to go with, but these new forms are sure as hell beat the same thing we had to stare at for years. I like all the new little details (four claws now, stronger maul to reflect this change, please) more polygons, eyes, nose, mouth (and it's ability to close, as said by the blues). <br />
<br />
I'm still a bit hazy on how could this take so long to develop. But still, can't wait for the patch to actually see it in game, I'm hoping by the time they're done, it will come out be even more polished and nice looking. <br />
<br />
Still though, definitely not a game breaking change and not really needed, people who whined about forms and still rolled druids got something confused when they reached lvl 10. Want to look shiny and pretty, roll a Paladin. <br />

I am not crying about getting a vanity update. But I think its stupid that blizz focus on such minor issues instead of fixing druids in other ways.. like nerfing their damned healing.<br />

That feature should be there from beginning, so we could now focus on other stuff then skin look, which took them 2 years to make.<br />

Balance. Think they got that in another game.. chess perhaps? Healing was always retarded, but before that, the dps was even more retarded. <br />
<br />
Beginning of the expansion: <br />
Tab a target, blow it up, tab a target, blow it up.<br />
Mid season: <br />
Tab a target, blo...errr, never mind, that resto (disc priest or holy paly) is on that target, I guess the game promises to be 15 minutes before one of us fucks up and we or they lose the game. <br />
<br />
It's not just about druids, it's about balancing dps vs healing, and not just balancing them, but balancing them in a sandbox arena, which is a part of the game too though. And I agree it wasn't life altering change, but please stop crying &quot;balance&quot; (nerf) something, when the entire game needs to be fine tuned and it never is going to happen.</div></div><hr />

Anyway I'd like a christmas tree, apple tree and some nice green leaves for my tree form.<br />

Yeah, true that you cant just balance the whole game in a moment.. But damn, blizz had 4 years to do so, they could come up with new strategy to try out for the balance.. Their problem is that the time they nerf something, they buff something else as well.. &quot;Wheels on a buss go round and round&quot;.. instead of buffing/nerfing a class, and leave it at that, adjusting rest of classes to suit its power.<br />
<br />
Or just screw the whole system and reduce whole idea of CC and spamhealing, making damage more constant.. Duno, but in 4 years one could think they would come up with a kind of balance, atleast for arenas. And I really dont think that &quot;sandbox&quot; term can apply to wow in any matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can't do that while stunned, sounds familiar?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You cant do that since druid trinket out of stun and his arena mate is CC'ing sh*t outta you while druid is running away in cat to cast roots/cyclone, sounds familiar?</div></div><hr />

I was merely saying you can't do anything against rogue stuns either, which makes it exactly the same as cyclone. Only difference is cyclone has a casting time, which makes it possible to be interrupted which usually means a dead druid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hadn't planned on posting, just because the glimmer of &quot;hey, that's nice,&quot; is going to be lost in the fray. However, as a professional graphic artist, I do take it upon myself to stomp on some misinformation from the fool quoted below.<br />
<br />
<br />
Compared with the old bear form, you just have to look at the ragged edges of the old model and glance at the sleek new skin to realise that these new models carry at least 4 TIMES the number of polygons used on the old bear model, and they have quite likely followed in the trend of all current wrath content and upgraded to Tri-polygons (This is the reason for smoother models and edges in wrath for those less fammiliar with these terms, like half the trolls in this topic)<br />
<br />
<br />
1. The &quot;ragged edges&quot; of the old model were caused by a lower-resolution texture map. The new ones have a higher resolution, therefore sharper details and alpha (transparency) maps.<br />
2. I would honestly be surprised if the polycount was even doubled for the models. I'm guessing it's about 80% higher than the original. A good modeling technique will stretch even that small boost in polycount a very long way.<br />
3. 'Tri-polygons?' Really? The entire WoW engine uses solely triangles, and always has. Look at the banner for the page for the original article (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/druid-forms.html) and you'll see a wireframe of the female Troll model. Count with me as we discover that, as with the overwhelming majority of games, all the polygons in the final model are triangles.<br />
<br />
<br />
While I'm excited about the changes, I don't understand why you'd try spewing misinformation about the development process for the models, or the techniques used. Even if you had the best of intentions in attempting to defend the new models, you've done nothing at all to help the cause. Kindly leave the technical discussion to folks that understand the technicalities discussed.</div></div><hr />

You are right. Rogues seems to be only class which can kill resto druids effectively at the moment (Unless druid will notice that its weird that he cant see anyone in arena, hot him self to full, trinket outta kidneyshot and switch to bear.. yes, I love theory crafting:D).

This makes it so a level 20 can look as cool as a level 80. Different tier gear should allow different looks to unlock.. maybe allow new textures or markings. You should only get a couple choices at level 20 for example and many more at 80. I like the idea of being able to change the look but it still doesn't allow anyone to show off their gear since they are currently in a form, so basing it on what level and gear level to what markings textures you can unlock would be much better than just giving everyone everything right off.</div></div><hr />

It takes 2 years for them to &quot;remodel&quot; the druid forms and all they come up with is ... new colors? Seriously, this probably took about 10 minutes development time in some kind of graphics program.<br />
<br />
The bear still has its mouth open all the time, and looks really really weird all over when you inspect it closely.<br />

It's a new model.<br />
Higher polygon count. note the horns have a much better shape. New and extra claws. Old bear has 3 toes and tiny claws. The snarl is now updated like the new Wrath bears. (think dun morough cub pet if you want reference)<br />

Why don't you fuck off. This thread can be summarised by &quot;We waited incredibly patiently for 4-5 years, believed the promises that Blizzard gave about working hard on new forms all this time, and after years of development all we got were some updated models and a few skincolour options&quot;. If you don't play a druid as your main you have no idea how frustrating it is to upgrade your gear constantly and see ZERO difference in your character. <br />
<br />
Gearing up and looking cooler is half of the point of this game in case you didn't realise, and Druids are the only classes that don't experience any kind of visual upgrade when they progress. I was in a WG yesterday healing my ass off, with another Tree Druid. For everyone in the raid the two of us were interchangeable, yet I was in Ulduar epics and he was in greens. You have the benefit of walking onto a BG and having people see you coming in full Ulduar epics and think &quot;shit, this guy's a good player, he's going to pwn me&quot;. With Druids, all people see is the same model as every other Druid of that spec. Can you not begin to see how shit that is, and how simply giving us the option to recolour ourselves fixes NONE of that?<br />
<br />
The real thing that's depressing me about this announcement is that the fact that we are only getting slightly updated, recoloured forms means that effectively any kind of gear-scaling form implementation is years away still. At least before we had some kind of hope in ignorance. Now it's clear we're going to be stomping around Sargeras' back yard before we actually have our forms reflect our gear in any way. We're not pissed off with these forms, they're perfectly nice, we're pissed off because it means what we really want is still years away (otherwise they would just have waited another few months and released the whole package), and after years of promises that's frankly bullshit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So as a graphic designer appartently you have never looked into the WoW engine about which you are posting? fair enough most polygon models in WoW use triangle polygons ,but not exclusively, which has caused major problems with graphics cards using the &quot;conformant texture clamp&quot; feature in the past (didnt read a lot into this), but I am not soley speaking of character models<br />
<br />
as an example (not the best example, but its all I have) and old wireframe shot when playing around with OpenGL format (for the frist and last time:P)<br />
<br />
http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m16/blackdragon453/WoWScrnShot_091507_080129.jpg<br />
<br />
Much of the geometry in the game Pre-Wrath was non-conformant, I may not know all of the industriallly correct terms for the way these polygons are threaded together, but there were many &quot;filler&quot; polygons consisting of 4 or five sided shapes, which is what has been eliminated by the new wrath engine to which I was reffering, I have read into this extensively because its caused me severe graphical problems in the past.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So you wouldn't mind wearing the same gear you were wearing at Level 10, just with updated stats? You wouldn't mind the exact same look on your character for 4 years? If you think this is about epeen you're a tool- it's about wanting to see the progression you've made with your character actually reflected in your character. EVERYBODY wants that, it's why we spend so much time on our characters, gearing them up. It's why there's so much QQ when a tier set looks crap, why people complain about bad models on gear- are you seriously suggesting it's out of order to want the look of your character to reflect the fact that you've progressed past level 10? Is that really a lot to ask? Honestly, try understanding someone's position before you start levelling accusations you prick.</div></div><hr />

With Druids, all people see is the same model as every other Druid of that spec. Can you not begin to see how shit that is, and how simply giving us the option to recolour ourselves fixes NONE of that?<br />
<br />
The real thing that's depressing me about this announcement is that the fact that we are only getting slightly updated, recoloured forms means that effectively any kind of gear-scaling form implementation is years away still. At least before we had some kind of hope in ignorance. Now it's clear we're going to be stomping around Sargeras' back yard before we actually have our forms reflect our gear in any way. We're not pissed off with these forms, they're perfectly nice, we're pissed off because it means what we really want is still years away (otherwise they would just have waited another few months and released the whole package), and after years of promises that's frankly bullshit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ofc we are happy that finally something changes about our forms. But... is that all we may expect after 4 years ? It's very much too little too late.<br />
OP expresses it like it really is</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darthyogi</div><div class="date">2009-05-27, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you wouldn't mind wearing the same gear you were wearing at Level 10, just with updated stats? You wouldn't mind the exact same look on your character for 4 years? If you think this is about epeen you're a tool- it's about wanting to see the progression you've made with your character actually reflected in your character. EVERYBODY wants that, it's why we spend so much time on our characters, gearing them up. It's why there's so much QQ when a tier set looks crap, why people complain about bad models on gear- are you seriously suggesting it's out of order to want the look of your character to reflect the fact that you've progressed past level 10? Is that really a lot to ask? Honestly, try understanding someone's position before you start levelling accusations you prick.<br />
<br />
Really? REALLY? You justify your entire game play experience on what you can and can not wear as a FUCKING TREE? Yes I like the armors my druid gets, but the fact my cat form doesnt have Ulduar tier catform armor really doesnt bother me. In fact it lets me be a little more sneaky. &quot;Hey theres a druid in cat form. Does he have Icecrown greens or is he tiered out? better not risk it.&quot;<br />
If you are seriously whining over what you can and cant not wear in a damn animal form, delete your toon, gtfo, and /wrists. Honestly the amount of whine that goes on. <br />
&quot;WWWWHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAA I WANT ARMOR FOR MY TREE!!!!!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok ok here your Ulduar armor will not morph to match your tree form.&quot;<br />
&quot;WWWWHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA MY TREE FORM LOOKS RETARDED NOW!!!!!!! GG BLIZZ!&quot;<br />
<br />
Honestly, try understanding someone's position before you start levelling accusations you prick.<br />
YOU were the one pissed off people couldnt see your Ulduar epics. YOU were the one QQing that people didnt cower in fear of you. That tells me you like and want people looking at you and fawning over you and your pixel purple lewts. I bet you sit around in Dalaran just so people can look upon your glory and marvel at how uber leet you are in this game. If that isnt epeen stroking, then I dont know what is.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gilfanon</div><div class="date">2009-05-27, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">*sigh*<br />
<br />
If I wanted to epeen in Dalaran all day I might try doing some revolutionary like, erm, dropping out of a Druid form and standing in caster form? The only problem is, I don't want to ePeen- I want to get out and raid/PVP/PVE. The example I gave of being in WG was an illustrative fucking example which you've felt necessary to build into a straw man- if you're too intellectually challenged to see it as an example and extrapolate from there, and need a generalised principle to explain what I'm saying to you, let me explain it slowly for you, step by step:<br />
<br />
1) WOW is a game about progression. Slowly building up your character over time.<br />
2) Progression is reflected in both character statistics and appearance.<br />
3) Having one's appearance remain static for 4 fucking years takes enjoyment out of progressing one's character<br />
<br />
Seriously, what is there not to understand? I repeat my question, would your average warrior be happy in the same gear looks-wise that he was wearing at level 40, even if the stats were that of an Ulduar epic? Would we all be happy if Blizzard never added new armor models to the game, but simply upgraded the stats on existing items? No we fucking wouldn't be happy- welcome to the world of the Druid. <br />
<br />
You clearly either are a fucking bullshitter who doesn't have a Druid main, or haven't spent more than 5 minutes played on your Druid alt, or are suffering from some kind of severe dissociative personality disorder if you can't understand that how your character looks matters, whether you're a fucking tree, cat, Warlock or Priest. Why can you not fucking get that through your skull and empathise with Druid's frustration at having static forms?</div></div><hr />

Maybe if you relized that the forms are tools for you to use and too sit around in all day raiding/PvE/PvPing you'd stop QQing about how you dont get armor upgrades for your animal forms. Should Shamans Ghost Wolf form reflect thier armor too? Maybe Warlocks demon form should be wearing thier armor they have on. I know maybe DK should be able to keep thier armor when they rez as a Ghoul! If Bear/Cat/Tree/Moonkin forms were ment to have armor you'd be able to roll those as your toon. But you rolled a Night elf/Taruen. Thats what you are. Thats whats gets the armor. Dont like it? then gtfo. <br />
Oh and I have played my druid for more than 5 mins. Tanked SSC, TK, and BT back when those were end game. Am I tired of the bear form I've had since lvl10? Yes. I like the new models. They are new and something diffrent. I'm glad the model is getting an update. But I'm not going to get all retarded angry at the fact I cant be in bear form and marvel at my fat purples all day. Thats whats caster form is for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regardless of gear and stats your char is almost naked wearing only underwear. <br />
<br />
Every class would fight with bare hands almost naked, and when Blizz finally decided to give you better look, you would get better defined feminine or masculine body (more polys) wearing the recolored underwear.</div></div><hr />

You know what, if a Shaman or a Warlock or a DK made a post suggesting that their armor should be reflected in their various forms, I might make a cogent argument as to why spending development time on forms that those classes spend less than 5% of their time in should be lower priority that developing forms for Druids who spend 90% of their time in their forms. That's a logical, reasoned argument about the balance of development effort, as opposed to just being a nasty piece of work like you who feels the need to come onto these boards and go QQ MOAR!!! If you actually bothered to read my posts you'd see my anger is directed largely at the pricks like you who feel the need to come onto these boards and go &quot;LUL droods got new forms any you whiny bitches aren't happy&quot;. They're a response to provocation, and an explanation of why a slight remodelling, additional polygons and some hairstyles are a crap return on something that Blizzard have claimed to be working on for 2 years or more.<br />
<br />
I've posted plenty of constructive criticism in a balanced and measured way on these boards and the official Blizzard forums about the change. Don't expect me not to get angry when dealing with assholes who come onto these boards and go &quot;be happy with what you got Druids and gtfo&quot;. I responded to your original post in a measured and balanced way and pointed out what the issue was from my perspective, and you responded by ignoring any attempt at intelligent debate and chucking acres of capslock into your post, accusing me of whining. If I got angry, it's got nothing to do with 'not being able to see my phat purples', and everything to do with having to deal with annoying, idiotic l33tkiddies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To all of you QQer's, just SHUT UP! Blizz finally does something, even so minor as this, and you can't even enjoy it for 1 day before whining like little children! No wonder blizz waited all these years to make this change, they were hoping you would GROW UP in that time. I almost wish Blizz would take the form changes away, because clearly none of you whiners deserve them.<br />

Say, for instance, that Yogg Saron drops the white bear/cat/tree/boomkin skin (actually personally I think that they should just do away with boomkin and tree forms). You can learn the skin and then get it applied via haircut vendor.<br />
<br />
To me this seems like the perfect middle-of the-road solution. Then the developers only have to make a new model every 2-4 patches and it is very clear how far you have progressed in the game based on your druid's model.</div></div><hr />

But then the question comes, how long must something of low priority sit at low priority? This is what, three or four years promised? How many more years until it is acceptable?<br />
<br />
There's always something more important than the art and detail on character textures yet you'd probably throw an even bigger fit if you never got new texture upgrades to your armor or character. Imagine all gear having the same quality and textures as vanilla WOW. Bet you wouldn't be so quick to QQ then if they decided to upgrade them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Oh wow you got me there. I am undone. How could this happen to me? /wrists<br />
First I never said that my druid was my main. That would be my lvl 80 hunter, whos guild is progressing thru Ulduar quite nicely and we did just fine in TBC for guild that had to pug people for raids because others couldnt show. Took a break from the druid because I got tired of tanking, and wanted to do something diffrent. Still doesnt change my point about not having armor in whatever form. The fact remains that certain people will bitch and complain, however they coach it in &quot;Logical arguements&quot;, and will never be happy. There is no reason, besides being able to look pretty in what ever form you are in, to have your loot show in bear/cat/moonkin/tree form. If you really arent concerned with random people looking at you and going &quot;Wow that guy is hardcore!&quot; then what does it matter. You know how much ass you've kicked. Your friends know how bad ass you are. You guild knows you are the lynchpin of thier raid healing and dont go into battle with out you. Yet you feel the need for complete strangers to &quot;OOOOHHHHHH&quot; and &quot;AAAAHHHHH&quot; over you and your epic armors and pat you on the back? But its not about that right?</div></div><hr />
