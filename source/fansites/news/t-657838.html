TheSpeedGamers - Final Fantasy Marathon<br />
I don't post a lot about charity events and I thought it might be a good occasion to do it. TheSpeedGamer’s Final Fantasy marathon to raise money for ACT Today (http://www.act-today.org/) began on Friday July 17th @ 6pm cst and will last one week (168 hours straight!). Final Fantasy 1-12 will be played with no tool assistance. A game feed will be hosted here on our site www.TheSpeedGamers.com alongside a commentary feed and chatroom.<br />
<br />
I'll keep the stream embedded here for a few hours to give them some exposure, I will remove it sooner or later depending on what happens in the World of Warcraft today. <br />
<br />
Please check their website to donate (http://www.thespeedgamers.com/). Even a few dollars will make a difference.<br />

Blue posts<br />
Population imbalances in Battlegrounds<br />
We've been discussing the population imbalances in Battleground matches a lot lately. If you read the Battleground Q&amp;A we did a few weeks back, you may remember Cory Stockton mentioning that we have a lot of plans for Battlegrounds -- including rated, performance-based Battlegrounds providing access to higher-quality rewards -- actively in the works. We'll be discussing more of this at BlizzCon, but I'll add that the issue of faction imbalances in Battlegrounds you mention is something we recognize as a problem and plan to address when we're prepared to roll out some revitalizing touches to the Battleground system.<br />
<br />
Many of our plans are not fully conceptualized to the extent that I'm able to share details with you at the moment, but I'm confident you'll hear more at Blizzcon and perhaps the weeks to follow the event. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/18600872382-fix-av-please.html))<br />
<br />
Class representation and game balance<br />
Say we did some extensive data extraction from Ulduar and found that only 5% of guilds use Feral tanks when learning hard modes. Assume for the sake of my very contrived example that we could somehow select for those guilds with a potential to beat the encounters, but that the encounters weren't on farm yet. Assume that the sample size was somehow large enough that the statistics are not at fault in any of this data collection. (I'm trying not to let you Kobayashi Maru your way out of being able to resolve the scenario.)<br />
<br />
Now, let's also assume that we convinced ourselves beyond a shadow of a doubt that using a competent and appropriately geared Feral tank made most of the hard mode encounters significantly easier. Assume that the community also felt the same way -- that it wasn't a dark secret.<br />
<br />
The fair thing to do from a balance point-of-view would be to nerf Feral tanks. This will likely cause the percentage of them to drop from say 5% to 2% or virtually nil. A game designer should look at that and say: Yikes!<br />
<br />
You can argue that maybe the bear is just a horribly frustrating spec to play and so nobody does it despite its advantages. I don't really buy that though. Players tend to say that about all of the classes, and I don't see a lot of evidence that Ferals are somehow unique in this regard. Furthermore, many of our players will do things that are soul-crushingly frustrating if they think it might confer to them a small advantage, which is often why we nerf such things -- to save players from themselves so to speak. It's just hard to resolve how, in this particular example, why more guilds don't go stampeding towards druid tanks if they are overpowered.<br />
<br />
It's a tough question -- what to do with the overpowered but underplayed spec, assuming it doesn't have any crippling gameplay flaws? What do you do with the spec that is wildly popular but underpowered? Do you make them somehow less fun (even if it's relative) so players try out the other specs? I think saying &quot;just make all the specs as fun!&quot; is a cop out. We try to do that all the time, but I don't think that will ever result in as many shamans as warriors.<br />
<br />
This is why I say we don't balance around representation. We don't tweak numbers until we have 25% of each tank in Ulduar.(Or should the number skew higher towards DKs since they have more than one spec? Or should the numbers skew lower for paladins and druids since fewer races can be them?) But we do have to consider representation when we're making changes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/18358915042-why-is-class-representation-considered.html))<br />
<br />
&quot;Bring the Player, not the class&quot; and raiding homogenization<br />
We don't think that's true. Some of you guys seem to always head for a purity of game design where things would look very neat in a table or plotted on a graph. But we're not trying for a design where every possible raid comp is equally viable. We don't need to support a design where the raid of 8 mages and 2 dps warriors is as effective as the raid with 10 Holy paladins.<br />
<br />
All we need to accomplish is to give groups enough flexibility to be able to bring the players they want while still getting all of the big buffs and enough of the smaller buffs. And we've done that. In the Sunwell days, the rosters of most progression-oriented raiding guilds (basically the ones trying today's equivalent of hard modes) were very similar. Now they are quite diverse. We don't have 30 specs represented yet, but we have 4 tanks, 5 healers and at least one dps spec of every class. That's more class diversity in raiding than WoW has ever had before. If you look at the guilds doing hard modes, they have pretty different rosters these days and that's even more true of the normal modes.<br />
<br />
If you're new to raiding in WoW, that's awesome because a lot of people are and we made a big effort in LK to make that happen. But talk to the groups that did Sunwell and the frustration they had in trying to build their raids. The first thing these guys said to us when they heard about a new class was &quot;There's no room in my raid to take any.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you're looking for that one thing that's going to get you a raid spot, I'd shoot for a reputation that you know what the blank you're doing and some good friends. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443190965-bring-the-player-not-the-class-should-be.html))<br />

Comparing Restoration Druids and Shadowform<br />
I think the best way to explain it is that when the Shadow priest has a model to follow – there are dps casters and in this case, a class with healing capabilities is deciding to turn its back on those abilities in order to be more like those casters. You can debate the relative power and utility of say Shadow priest and warlock, but at a high level there is a lot of overlap there. Now consider the Resto druid who decides to go Tree of Life. He is becoming a new type of character – he isn’t like the other healers, because they aren’t giving up buttons (except for those already absent from their talent tree). The Resto druid is giving up buttons, and for what? To be as effective a healer as the others. (You can argue Resto druids are overpowered if you’d like, but it certainly isn’t the design that Tree of Life allows druids to be the best healer in the game). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/18601080646-druid-qa-the-twilight-zone.html))<br />
<br />
Tree of Life<br />
Yup. But honestly I think even before LK that Tree of Life wasn't situational enough -- it was just strictly a mistake to be in it nearly all the time in PvP. As I said with the Balance example above, it might work better if you decided &quot;Okay I am going to be in Tree form for a little while because of the situation.&quot; It's a pretty different model, but imagine a druid changed forms at least once or twice a battle. That feels a little more like the shapeshifting druids from Warcraft lore. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/18601080646-druid-qa-the-twilight-zone.html))<br />
<br />
Balance druids and shifting<br />
Yeah, we agree. That is what I was getting at with the druid as a shifter. The idea is that a Balance druid would sometimes leave Moonkin form, but we haven’t made it easy enough to do so. We also don’t want to just adopt a model where say you shift to caster form to decurse and shift back – that just means your decurses take 3 button clicks (or a macro). It should be more tactical than that – do I want to be in Moonkin form for a little while, or would I rather be in caster form (or possibly even bear or cat)? (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/18601080646-druid-qa-the-twilight-zone.html))<br />

Healing as a Shadowpriest<br />
I think you could make a few changes and insure that Shadow priests were about at the same healing level as say Ret or Elemental. You’d still have to decide if their healing got any better just from dropping Shadowform. If not, then there is probably no reason to ever drop Shadowform, and it should just be a passive talent not a spell. If so, then you'd have to make sure the spec wasn't too powerful over all as a backup or emergency healer, especially in PvP -- remember, we'd be talking about a Shadow priest who heals as well as Ret when in Shadowform, but better than that when not in Shadowform. <br />

Seriously, though, if they would just adjust the healing your raid gets from Vampiric Embrace, spriests could put out a fairly decent amount of healing. Enough to make raid healers' jobs easier, at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard has to really change the way balance spec works in order to pull this off. <br />
<br />
Shifting out of moonkin form? In pvp, pretty much suicide. Maybe in 5's and better be perfectly timed to offset the dps drop. Pve shifting out: loss of dps, crappy heals, burn through mana like crazy; I can only condone the casting of rebirth. (Not to mention decursing is done in moonkin form anyways...)<br />
And moonkin with incentive to shift into bear or cat? LOL, are you serious? Tell me why there were two different specs for feral and balance to start out with? I am usually okay with what blizz posts say, but I got to wonder...does he know what he is talking about?</div></div><hr />

I think you could make a few changes and insure that Shadow priests were about at the same healing level as say Ret or Elemental.

<br />
Well for starters... Ret and ele don't have a massive mana cost or extra GCD required to go back to a damage dealing form. Does healing get any better from dropping shadowform? Errr.... aside from VE, all of our other heals go from being uncastable to castable, so I'd say yes. And a shadow priest heals as well as ret when in shadowform? Who are you kidding? VE, even talented, doesn't deliver as much healing as JoL from a ret pally. Though I admit we are much more effective than ret when dropping shadowform, we no longer retain the ability to effectively do damage at that point.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baaadum</div><div class="date">2009-07-20, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm, I would suggest that:<br />
<br />
1. Shapeshifting costs no mana... or is significantly lowered without having to spend talent points for it. <br />
2. Shapeshifting is on a separate Global CD like a hunter's aspects.<br />
3. Perhaps to keep it &quot;balanced&quot; they can give a penalty like &quot;While in moonkin form the effectiveness of your heals is reduced by X% (as well as Shadowform).&quot; Would be lame, tbh, but just an idea.<br />
<br />
And as far as ToL casting balance spells... just give me cyclone and entangling roots I'll be good :D</div></div><hr />

I think 2. is clear now. I wonder were all those communists come from, complaining that Blizzard - a profit oriented private company - is actually making money with their work.

<br />
Seriously, though, if they would just adjust the healing your raid gets from Vampiric Embrace, spriests could put out a fairly decent amount of healing. Enough to make raid healers' jobs easier, at least.<br />
<br />
<br />
If VE did a significant amount of healing it would create class balance issues. If spriest still did strong DPS and a lot of healing they would be overpowered and it would be too desirable to stack them in a raid. (One could argue the healing for JoL is also overpowered but the amount healed is no longer dependent on attack power in patch and only 1 JoL effect can be present on a mob so no need to stack ret pally). If they lowered spriest DPS then they would often be less desirable to bring. Blizzard's current solution is VE doesn't do much healing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daedius</div><div class="date">2009-07-20, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">^^ VE used to do a LOT of healing til it got nerfed big time :D<br />
<br />
i.e. - 25% of the damage you were doing was healing people. 2k dps = 500hps ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pushing millions more healing as any healer class in any raid, with virtually no overheal (due to their dynamic &amp; I know nobody cares about it but me) isn't overpowered. Or how about going to 4500-5000HPS with green/blue gear while all the other healers struggle to even get close to that in udluar gear. Our healing druids push at least 6mio more healing per Ulduar raid as any other healer priest/pala/shaman.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand how anyone can not see how out of balance the healing druid really is. He trivializes every raid encounter, cancel the healing druid from the raid and it gets 10 times harder - I guess this is the reason why Blizzard isn't really acting with the nerf bat, if they would, majority of the guilds would struggle in ulduar and some encounters are next to impossible without one, not so without other healing classes. <br />
<br />
I especially love the untouchable 5v5 Tree druid team, 5 trees, no chance to win - give me a break. <br />

All the above can be confirmed by virtually any healer in raids with healing meters. Druids push serious amount of HPS and are de-facto the best raid healers right now in the game, and they can still perform as a MT healer. And you guess is wrong, I'm playing a healing priest, since 2004 and I know how to heal thank you. Problem here is, that you didn't come across a good healing druid. I know druids who can't come close to my healing and I know druids who I can't touch and we all are equally equipped.<br />

Druids aren't great MT healers ;)<br />
<br />
Their high HPS is due to casting instant cast heals on numerous players - that high dps DOES NOT count towards a single target, i.e. the MT... as their ticks can't cope with the large damages dealth successively.</div></div><hr />

I know they are not great, if I said that, I didn't mean to, but they can do it, if needed. Doesn't really mater here, noone would put a druid on a MT in a proper raid. The only thing missing would be if they could keep tanks alive all the time, then I'd just throw the towel.</div></div><hr />

But they can't, and Blizzard knows that - and they plan to keep it that way. And guess what, you still have a raid spot. So what are you complaining about? They do one job better, you do another job better.</div></div><hr />

Because healing meters are clearly the bottom line when it comes to who are the best healers, right? <br />
A resto spamming rejuv and wild growth on the raid sure can top meters but hots aren't going to save everybody from dying. Because, who cares if the raid continues to wipe just as long as you're topping healing meters... right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As a means to provide more flexibility to play with your friends, or move to a realm that may better serve your needs, we are reducing the cooldown of the Paid Character Transfer service from 30 days to 3 days. This should prove particularly beneficial to players who...<br />
... like to continue stuffing our ass full with additional fees and extra cash. We of course don't do this to help enhance the game's convenience, but rather to earn us even more cash. Additionally, the more money we earn, certainly the less we'll spend on server infrastructure and employing good personell, therefore continuing to ruin the game and commercialise it more and more and more.<br />

Blizzard even before this change made it way too easy to transfer. Want to ninja something? Sure just transfer. Stuck on a boss? Oh find another guild and transfer. New server where you dont know anyone isnt perfect? Oh just transfer again.<br />
<br />
Servers used to have community before blizzard made it so that you could transfer any time you felt like it. Lowering the PCT cooldown just caters to ninjas, ebayed characters and perennial guild-quitters who have no concept of loyalty or tenacity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) We can't change armor when in combat (that's the definition of emergency healer), so FoL will never be instant. <br />
<br />
2) Ret manapool = Priest mana pool? Ret mana eficience/pool is really stupid. And as a emergency healer, we're talking about stop DPSing to heal, and probably leaving melee range, so no DPS, almost 0 mana return to ret.<br />
<br />
3) Ret dps sux in Holy gear... So... they're talking about the small heals while DPSing, like JoL, VE...<br />
<br />
4) With shitty heals and not casting heals while with the Divine Plea buff, how the hell Ret would be usable as emergency healer?!?!?!<br />

How can a player know they don't like the server in 3 days...it takes atleast 15-30 days to know if a server fits you.<br />
<br />
<br />
I transfered once to a new realm, promising guild, horde first progress wise, great leadership and members, but for some reason still unknown to me, players started leaving, this was 5 days after I transfered to them, I was stuck on that realm for 25 days, I can see how this change earlier would have brought me back to a couple of e-buddies. Of course they want to make money, they are a business corporation and not a charity, stop accusing them of being money horny because it's pointing out the obvious...</div></div><hr />
