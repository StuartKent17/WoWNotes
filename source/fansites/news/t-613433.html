Hello Warriors, 
 
I’ve got a sneak preview of things coming up in the beta for you to discuss. We still have lots of polish and bug fixing to do and we’re still wrestling with a few elements of the warrior abilities and talents so do not consider this an exhaustive list. As always, post any concerns or suggestions you have.

Hello Warriors,<br />
<br />
I’ve got a sneak preview of things coming up in the beta for you to discuss. We still have lots of polish and bug fixing to do and we’re still wrestling with a few elements of the warrior abilities and talents so do not consider this an exhaustive list. As always, post any concerns or suggestions you have.<br />
<br />
General<br />
Enraged Assault redesigned, now Enraged Regeneration: You regenerate 30% of your total health over 10 sec. This ability consumes all Enrage effects and prevents any from affecting you for the full duration. Must be enraged to use. Cost 15 rage, 3 min cooldown.<br />
Slam – We’re working to change this ability to suspend the swing timer when you are using the ability. In other words, if you’re .5 sec away from swinging your weapon when you start using Slam you’ll be .5 sec from swinging your weapon after Slam goes off.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Arms<br />
Improved Charge now generates 5/10 rage.<br />
Mace Specialization now ignores 3/6/9/12/15% of target’s armor.<br />
Sudden Death and Trauma swapped locations.<br />
Bladestorm now lasts 6 seconds, causing a whirlwind every second.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Protection<br />
Toughness now also reduces duration of movement slowing effects by 10/20/30/40/50%.<br />
Improved Sunder Armor renamed Puncture, reduced to 2 ranks for 1/2 rage cost reduction.<br />
Improved Disarm reduced to 2 ranks, now reduces the cooldown of Disarm by 10/20 sec and increases damage taken by disarmed targets by 5/10%.<br />
Improved Defensive Stance reduced to 2 ranks, now reduces spell damage taken by 3/6% and any block/parry/dodge has a 50/100% chance to enrage the warrior causing 5/10% more damage for 12 sec.<br />
Vigilance will soon transfer the 10% threat lost to the warrior. It will also have 3 charges to curb using it on targets that are being hit constantly. We’re still polishing this element to get it to feel right.<br />
(NEW) Warbringer is a new one point talent on Tier 9 that allows Charge to be used in combat. Did I mention the change to Improved Charge?<br />
Critical Block now also increases your chance to critically hit with your Shield Slam by 5/10/15%.<br />
Sword and Board no longer triggers when Shield Slam is used, but the chance to trigger has increased to 3/6/9/12/15%. Note these are not final numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Fury<br />
Intensify Rage and Precision swapped locations.<br />
Enrage now increases damage done by 3/6/9/12/15%, limitation on number of attacks removed.<br />
Improved Whirlwind now increases damage of Whirlwind by 10/20%, no longer reduces cooldown.<br />
Furious Attacks changed to use PPM (procs per minute) to make it trigger at the same rate regardless of weapon speed. Note that dual-wielding and haste still improve your chances.<br />
Titan’s Grip still needs a counterbalancing element, but what it will entail and how severe it will be is still being evaluated.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To answer a few questions:<br />
Yes, I meant Furious Attacks, not Focused Attacks.<br />
Some notes are already in the beta, some are not updated yet on the calculator so wanted to give additional visibility to anyone else reading the forums.<br />
Warbringer: What we don't want to see is Charge becoming part of a tanking rotation. At the moment it will remain usable only in Battle Stance. An experimental idea to be sure.<br />
Stance Dancing: The short answer here is we want just the right amount of it. <br />
Final numbers are not in yet for the various talent trees. We want all trees to be viable in PvP and PvE so expect further number tuning across all classes/specs.<br />
The important upcoming change to Vigilance is the threat transfer. 10% of the target's generated threat will go to your threat total.<br />
Bladestorm consuming rage every second is a bug that's been fixed.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/rogue.jpg Upcoming Rogue Update<br />
Here’s a quick update on some additional changes we’ve made over the weekend. Most of these, but not all, will be in the next beta build.<br />
<br />
General<br />
Cloak of Shadows cooldown changed to 1.5 min.<br />
Disarm Trap range increased to 20 yds, cast time reduced to 1 sec, now requires stealth.<br />
(NEW – Level 75) Tricks of the Trade: The current party or raid member becomes the target of your Tricks of the Trade. The threat caused by your next attack and all actions taken for 6 sec afterwards will be transferred to the target. In addition, all damage caused by the target is increased by 15% during this time. 30 sec cooldown. (Surprise! Yes, this is the new group/raid utility ability. We haven’t put any stacking protection on it yet but we’ll need one type of solution or other to prevent the need for 5 rogue Trick rotations. Note also that you cannot use this ability on yourself.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Assassination<br />
Vigor moved to Tier 3.<br />
Relentless Strikes moved to Subtlety Tier 1, made 5 ranks for 4/8/12/16/20% chance.<br />
Murder moved to Tier 6, now increases damage by 2/4%.<br />
(NEW – Tier 7) Overkill: Abilities used while stealthed and for 6 seconds after breaking stealth cost 10 less energy.<br />
Focused Attacks and Turn the Tables have swapped locations.<br />
Master Poisoner moved to Tier 9, no longer increases chance to hit with poison attacks, now increases the critical hit chance of all attacks made against any target you have poisoned by 1/2/3% and reduces the duration of all Poison effects applied to you by 17/34/50%. (This does not stack with the Paladin talent Heart of the Crusader.)<br />
Hunger for Blood duration increased to 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Combat<br />
Precision now also increases chance to hit with poison attacks by 1/2/3/4/5%.<br />
Nerves of Steel will now reduce damage taken while stunned or feared by 15/30% rather than reducing duration.<br />
Improved Sprint moved to Tier 4.<br />
Blade Twisting now slows movement speed by 70%.<br />
Mace Specialization now ignores 3/6/9/12/15% of target’s armor.<br />
Throwing Specialization now also has a chance to interrupt target when Fan of Knives is used.<br />
Unfair Advantage: Whenever you dodge an attack you strike back for 50/100% of your main hand weapon’s damage.<br />
Stay of Execution removed, replaced with Blood Poisoning.<br />
(NEW – Tier 9) Blood Poisoning: All physical damage caused to enemies you have poisoned is increased by 1/2%.<br />
Prey on the Weak now increases critical strike damage of all attacks.<br />
Killing Spree is the new name for Murder Spree and should be working much better very soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Subtlety<br />
Shadowstep will no longer be usable while rooted.<br />
Elusiveness moved to Tier 3, now reduces cooldown of Cloak of Shadows by 15/30 sec.<br />
Premeditation cooldown reduced to 20 sec.<br />
Preparation no longer refreshes the cooldown to Premeditation.<br />
Master of Deception reduced to 3 ranks.<br />
Opportunity reduces to 2 ranks for 10/20%.<br />
Camouflage reduced to 3 ranks for 5/10/15% speed and 2/4/6 sec off the cooldown of Stealth.<br />
Initiative moved to Tier 4, increased to 33/66/100% chance.<br />
Improved Ambush moved to Tier 4, reduced to 2 ranks for 25/50%.<br />
Serrated Blades moved to Tier 3.<br />
Wrongfully Accused replaced with Filthy Tricks.<br />
(NEW – Tier 9) Filthy Tricks: Reduces the cooldown of your Tricks of the Trade and Distract abilities by 5/10 sec.<br />
Slaughter from the Shadows now also reduces the energy cost of your Hemorrhage ability by 1/2/3/4/5.<br />
Shadow Dance redesigned, now allows the use of Sap, Garrote, Ambush, Cheap Shot, Premeditation, Pickpocket and Disarm Trap regardless of being stealthed. Those abilities all gain a cooldown of 2 sec. Lasts 10 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warlock.jpg http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/priest.jpg Priest / Warlock - Mind Flay Changes<br />
We'll be increasing Mind Flay's coefficient (base) by roughly 30% to start, and allow Mind Flay to crit. We may also do some tuneups to the Shadow tree as well, but as other players have mentioned the tree is really not the problem, just the base spells not scaling.<br />
<br />
Hopefully we can get the new Mind Flay in the next build, but allowing it to crit involves rebuilding the spell completely, which may take some time. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Please tell me you're going to give Affliction similar treatment.<br />
Something similar, yes. <br />

Blue posts<br />
<br />
Fear break mechanics<br />
Hex (and Fear, Entangling Roots, Freezing Trap etc.) is intended to break after a flat amount of damage relative to your HP pool, that may not currently be functioning as intended. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/9336628584-a-whine-about-hex.html))<br />
<br />
Holiday Achievements<br />
We might do this. We're still working heavily on the holiday achievements. In the next build, you'll see a lot of changes to the Winter Veil stuff as well as a lot of new Love Is In The Air achievements. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/9336581021-holiday-achievements--on-beta-server.html))<br />

Argent Champion Title (Exalted with Argent Dawn / Argent Crusade)<br />
We recently added Argent Champion as a title. It will be in the next build. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/9336500820-dont-be-shy-on-titles-please.html))<br />

Blood of the North changes<br />
We changed BoTN to be 3 ranks. That will leave Frost with not quite enough ranks in that tier for the moment though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/9336627636-my-problem-with-the-new-howling-blast.html))<br />
<br />
Blood Tree and DPS balancing<br />
I think that summarizes what I am trying to say pretty well. If Blood's dps is too low compared to the other trees, I would just like to see Blood's dps increase, but not necessarily all through MoM. Remember a couple of builds ago, everyone was Blood. So I don't think Blood's dps dropped dramatically as much as the other two overshadowed it.<br />
<br />
Putting Obliterate back on MoM and into DRM is something we might consider though, and when we get around to a numbers pass, I expect to find that Obliterate (and possibly Death Strike) still too weak. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/9336501035-we-are-not-ment-to-have-big-crits.html))<br />
<br />
Dark Command / Death Grip shared cooldown intended ?<br />
Bug. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/9336521145-darkcommanddgrip-shared-cooldown-intended.html))<br />
<br />
Talent synergy and Death Knight high DPS<br />
There is nothing wrong with good talent synergy. If, however, the death knight dps is too high compared to other classes, then either the talents need to come down or the abilities need to come down. A few players have made compelling (but not irrefutable) arguments that Scourge Strike for example can hit really hard because its damage is improved by so many talents. That's why I mentioned the talent synergy potentially (key word) being too good.<br />
<br />
While I suspect DK dps is too high, I can't state it for a certainty because we haven't finished our analysis yet. That's why I try to be cautious when I say it. Some of those crits are really, really big though.<br />
<br />
I do think the class should still be closer to the fewer big hits of an MS warrior than the many smaller hits of a rogue. I think we can keep that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/9336870816-so-good-talent-synergy-is-a-bad-thing.html))<br />
<br />
Death Knight threat generation<br />
Threat should scale with gear very well for the death knight. I say that because the DK has very few +threat abilities, especially compared to a warrior. They are built much more like a Prot paladin, whose threat scales enormously well with gear.<br />
<br />
Even the warrior's abilities should scale better in LK though. Sunder does more threat based on AP for example.<br />
<br />
We'll do a sanity pass on the DK numbers and see where we are. I don't think it's going to mean nerfing everything across the board. It wasn't that long ago players loved Heart Strike and Obliterate so I don't think we're talking about burning anything to the ground and starting over.

Relentless strikes gets replaced with vigor, not much for dps there.<br />

<br />
<br />
Assa has dps increasing talents in tier 1, tier 2, tier 3 and tier 4.<br />
Ruthlessness does increase damage, not much though, but still.<br />
<br />
Subtlety has &quot;nothing&quot; other than serrated blades in the first 4 tiers.<br />
It'd have be quite insane to replace that much talents. Which it isn't.<br />
<br />
So, with the new change you're forced to put 5 points in a tree you don''t want to use.<br />
Which used to be &quot;1&quot; point in the same tree, and allowed the use of extra poison damage.<br />
Quite lame to force us to spend 4 extra talent points this way.<br />
<br />
There's a few &quot;clunks&quot; in the combat tree still as well.<br />
When you reach the 4th tree, you're forced to waste 5 non dps talent points, into utilities you don't really need. Again once you reach the tier with vitality .</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that's what I'm saying, exactly.* I'm saying that having a healing effect is the best thing we could get EVER.* No, I'm saying that it's a bigger deal than a random charge that we don't need.<br />

<br />
Relentless strikes is tier 1 sublety as 5/5 points. Thats must for every build since it still almost on pair with compat potency even it`s tier 1 talent. And lethality is truly overrated talent. 15% dmg increase on critical sinister strike might sound nice but sinister strike alone is quite small chunk of your overall dmg. 30% more rupture which is main 5 cp finisher of the raiding rogue (propably stays that way for combat specs in wotlk) and 400 armor pen just seems to be a lot more better ofc depending of other sources of armor pen.<br />
<br />
Also it`s unlikely you will have enought crit to make lethality to match that, Pre tbc in rank 14 gear i was sitting just at 50% crit on raids using fists, where rogues geared smartly won`t get even close to those numbers nowadays.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's just no good &quot;flow&quot; in selecting talents currently.<br />
Swordspec is weak compared to close quarters combat and mace specialisation.<br />
Too many points wasted on &quot;survival&quot; stuff or utility junk we don't need.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

I think you missed the part where they said they stopped thinking like that and ferals will be Main tanks , sucks to not be special anymore heh?<br />
Anyway , where are the druids changes??Atm we have less armor then warriors , our dodge been nerfed and we are way behind with scaling vs other tanks and tbh I think no druid tanks likes the ideea of &quot;hp tank&quot;.<br />

Salvation was removed cause the style we ran heroics back in the days required us to have paladin. Fury warrior, combat rogue, and enh shaman... no cake without salva. For raiding it really doesn`t matter that much but for smaller scale content it`s reasonable change. (this is just example but ie for 5 mans you kind a wanted to have paladin just do them effectively.)</div></div><hr />

at any way, even with the new &quot;tank approach&quot; you mentioned, you will never be 100% or par with the warrior class, in all its aspects, purely because you can heal/range cast DPS/stealth etc, which warriors cant as they are a pure class. what you are meant to to, is compensated the difference from a warrior with those advantages, how to do it? too hard? too bad, reroll warrior/rogue/priest/mage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
äny reason for warrior to get that anyway? its not like he doesnt have more &quot;ohshit&quot; buttons while tanking anyway, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it is intended for PvP more than PvE. In PvE the minor heal has limited use, in PvP however the total lack of healing has been leaving warriors very handicapped in a lot of encounters.<br />
<br />
The warrior changes on the whole look really nice though.</div></div><hr />

Just don't take the point if you think it wont help you. The mitigation for tanking will be given, that is not the problem.<br />
<br />
Adding stuff to the prot which are not 'tanking' abilities (though i am sure they will be helpfull too) will not make us less of a tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me it sounds extremely powerful for raiding, with a 30 sec CD. So for almost 20% of the time the rogue mages no personal aggro AND can provide a tank with a big boost of his own, high DPS-threat AND increase tank damage by another 15% which also helps a lot to stay ahead in threat meters. Sounds like Rogues will never have to take a DPS break again. Unfortunatly I see a nerf coming for that increasing the CD or decreasing the percent values.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, apparently Blizz doesn't share your sentiments. Bears are intended to be full fledged MTs, right beside DKs. paladins and warriors, and if things are lacking, they will be changed. See: Numerous blue posts in the Feral thread. Besides, your faulty logic can be extended to delete the druid class, or alternatively nerf the warrior class, because warriors are DPS/tank hybrids.</div></div><hr />

Well, in the instances where you would use intercept instead of intervene, you can now use charge and actually still have some rage left after you've done your stance dancing.<br />

I tend to ignore instead of bitch about stupid changes that I shouldn't care about, and look more carefully at skills that I believe will make a difference in a way.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree, this self heal is HUGE for warrior tanks.<br />

You mean that Fury and Prot share the same Tree just like Druid Feral tree today? LOL<br />

Prot Warrior DPS today... meh<br />
<br />
lol If you actually read all those blue posts, you'll see that Blizz sentiments are that Druids, to be real MTs and compete against warriors/dks/pallys, will have some of their &quot;hybrid aspect&quot; nerfed. Only between melee DPS/tank, but still a nerf.</div></div><hr />

I can think of a few bosses where AoE silencing of all the healers makes a 30% HoT a welcome addition. And everything isn't about raiding, either. The usefulness of this will likely be more apparent when you start doing heroics.<br />

most ferals want to be able to tank and dps with only switching forms (and gear)<br />
only a handfull truly specialize in tanking or dps.<br />

still, druids are getting a lot of talents.. so much infact that it looks like 4 talent tree's.

<br />
just hoping the feral tank aspect gets some serious loving in a future patch.</div></div><hr />

I didn't read any further than that on the Rogue changes. They are clearly going to be even more 100%-0% than before. Sigh.</div></div><hr />

still don't like it.<br />

It's unlikely to have any pve purpose, other than for those few fights where you have to run in and out of the boss situation. Interestingly, there's getting to be more and more of those type of fights.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iselian</div><div class="date">2008-09-03, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taking a 2nd look at those warrior-tank changes, I'm liking them. Druids, DK's, paladins all bring more utility (blessings, b-rez, presences/auras, etc) that make the warrior's shouts pale in comparison. This gives the prot warriors a leg up in the tanking world, lets them have a great reason for being taken in. And hopefully they'll make those aggro-sensative fights a little easier.<br />
<br />
Also, thought on Vigilance; an offtank warrior in a dps/threat heavy fight (ie, Gruul, Voidreaver, Bloodboil) could easily use this to keep himself competitive in the fight for aggro. Well, it'd help at least.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tigercat</div><div class="date">2008-09-03, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new vigilance will be quite useful for bloodboil-esque fights in the future where aggro swaps through a taunt-immune boss have to be done.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shunuro</div><div class="date">2008-09-03, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">in reference to titan grip . nerfing synergy and changing rampage to crit instead of ap . really hinders bloodthirst top end damage . loosing might (at level 80 ) and ap from rampage is 1009 ap . 454 non crit or alot more if crit depending of spec and gear set bonuse, or metagems sockets . i think the lose of ap base from class makes up for titan grip . <br />
<br />
not to mention in 25 man raid our 41 point ability rampage will most likly be canceled out by leader of the pack considering there is just set 5% w/ out chance on hit to activate like rampage is currently .</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shunuro</div><div class="date">2008-09-04, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well from a survival point of view great . great a free pot once every 3 min. but from other class points of view over powered . this plus , second wind,bloodcraze , last stand , blood thirst depending on your spec arm,fury, prot will make os to hard to kill . mages etc have always depended on out lasting us though cc . this will give us to many personal heals to make it a fair and balanced fight . takes alot of skill out of fight . <br />
<br />
but hey who ever said things need to be fair . i can easily see an hybrid build w/ second wind,bloodcraze and using this new change in pvp to its finest ,</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tigercat</div><div class="date">2008-09-04, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, using your mage example, don't worry. Frost mages are getting even more ways to make sure you spend over 80% of your time either in a frost nova or staring at an ice block while trying to bandage.</div></div><hr />

If people do take all that then they would be gimping their Dps a bit I imagine. But we are a God awful class for 1 on 1 fights while we in a group are roughly equal to every other class in terms of effectiveness. With these heals we'll gain some much needed survivability so we stand a chance to win 1 on 1 and 3 - 4 dps teams in 3v3 and 5v5.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shunuro</div><div class="date">2008-09-04, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in the last 3 weeks lost bloodbath and now enraged assault not to mention rampage in addition (484 ap) for + 5% crit that in most raids will not apply not to mention no more over lapping buffs that effect all class's ( synergy) . i think theres been enough nerfing to the warrior class. titan grip is now fixed</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shunuro</div><div class="date">2008-09-04, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well got quick point to make on this topic . <br />
lvl 75 prot new skill : shield break <br />
lvl 75 fury new skill : enraged assault <br />
lvl 75 Arm new skill : nothing ...... <br />
<br />
make this new enrage regeneration an arms skill giving you the option to choose what to spend your enrage on . make us more diverse in our abilities . both are great options dont make it a one or the other when both would be benifitial</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarevokcz</div><div class="date">2008-09-04, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">be happy u have more 75lev skills, several classes are stuck with only 2 new spells, one 75, one 80 :)<br />
<br />

i feel your pain, you are not the only one, who got higher lev talent, which is based on some proc when another class(es) has same talent, lower in the tree and mostly in form of some aura for less points :)</div></div><hr />

Much needed survivability? Who are you kidding? You have more than enough already. You a f*cking warrior, not a healer.</div></div><hr />
