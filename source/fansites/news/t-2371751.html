As I understand it, you have to unlock them first, by doing a quest - Which is made available to you if you're exalted with the given race (in this case the Nightborne) and have finished their relating storyline.<br />

Yep they said once you unlock the heritage armor that every charcter of that race on your account can use it--they mentioned it in another post awhile back</div></div><hr />

Yes, you will be able to instantly race-change to the Allied Races the moment you unlock them. You won't, however, acquire the 'heritage armor', which is acquired by leveling an Allied Race character from level 20 (their starting level) all the way to 120. You could still acquire the 'heritage armor' after race-changing if you make a new alt of said allied race and level it all the way.<br />
<br />
'Heritage armor', by the way, is race-restricted their respective Allied Race, but is account-wide.</div></div><hr />

For somebody who played fully in legion it is not a biggie. Sure.<br />
<br />
But imagine new player who see advertise for those races and decide to start/return to wow when BfA launch. So now he need to spend probably weeks if not months to unlock races he want. <br />

Pretty fucked up. Especially it is big selling point for new expansion. I imagine they will unlock them soon after BfA or even just before expansion launch. Why fuck returning/new players?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember Allied Races is a feature announced for Battle for Azeroth. The huge requirements we have right now are probably related to be able to play them before the expansion as a &quot;pre-purchase privilege&quot;, I'm pretty sure they will have a way to work them out within any future expansion content. Maybe something like tabards you wear while completing any-zone World Quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are they REALLY fucked though...? <br />
<br />
If that's the case, why aren't new/returning players automatically awarded everything available from a previous expansion once it's over? Wouldn't want to have them see something they want that they'd have to play the game for, they'd be so &quot;fucked&quot;... <br />
<br />
Allied Races will be unlocked and something to pursue. I wouldn't imagine them to ease up on the requirements until BfA is over, and even then they'll probably require some metrics fulfilled before access is granted since they're kind of not meant to be part of the &quot;base selection&quot; of races.</div></div><hr />

They do have facial tattoo options, at least they're supposed to. They just don't always glow I guess. This is from wowhead:<br />

I thought you needed to do a quest after you meet the constraints to unlock them - which if true implies you would need a 110 Horde, could be wrong though.</div></div><hr />

The banners in the embassy on PTR showed the completed requirements account-wide and that should be enough to recruit them. Although you will definitely need a Horde character to do the recruitment quests so yeah.</div></div><hr />

If that's the case, why aren't new/returning players automatically awarded everything available from a previous expansion once it's over? Wouldn't want to have them see something they want that they'd have to play the game for, they'd be so &quot;fucked&quot;... <br />
<br />
Allied Races will be unlocked and something to pursue. I wouldn't imagine them to ease up on the requirements until BfA is over, and even then they'll probably require some metrics fulfilled before access is granted since they're kind of not meant to be part of the &quot;base selection&quot; of races.<br />
<br />
Allied Races are a FEATURE of coming expansion, not pre patch, not CURRENT expansion. Yes, i fully expect to have unlocked features of game i buy. Imagine if mount from deluxe edition was only unlocked if you were exalted with Hydraxian Waterlords.</div></div><hr />

The huge requirements we have right now are probably related to be able to play them before the expansion as a &quot;pre-purchase privilege&quot;, I'm pretty sure they will have a way to work them out within any future expansion content. Maybe something like tabards you wear while completing any-zone World Quests.<br />
<br />
Ok, but why?<br />
<br />
You still need to make scenario to unlock them when you learn WHY they join x faction. And that story will be irrelevant in expansion anyway so it is fluff. <br />
I actually expect them to be just unlocked when BfA launch, and, as you say, req are for playing before BfA launches. <br />

Or maybe they know something, or are hoping for something. Because today it's Nightborne, Tomorrow will be another race, then the day after and then the 4th day, and where does that put us? The 30th.

I was thinking like you in the beginning of Legion, then tried my best to make a Horde character on a Horde pve server (Played on a pvp Alliance server for YEARS), and it worked, leveled a couple of more characters along the way, now my new main is a Male Orc warrior, love it to the core, and with the upcoming Up-Right pose, he will be a beast :P<br />

Unlock achievements are confirmed to be account wide. You only need to do the requirements once on any character, regardless of race. However, you'll need a Horde character to do the story scenario to actually unlock them.</div></div><hr />

So by that logic using orb of deception gives me a huge advantage in pvp cause it makes me look 100% like the opposite faction? I know in reality it doesn't.<br />

<br />
By the way, regarding rep; I find it to be a problem with how different they are, only. Some are much easier to get, which means they are a nonissue for launch or preorder. If they want to do this, I would drop the requirement on launch. I know, for some that's like pandering to casuals or whatever they want to call it, but I think bringing people back in to the game is only a good thing for all the rest, and if you give them an entry barrier on a reason they get the game (like, the allied races feature) chances are they will decide not to. It's just not good from a business perspective, unless they can convey to all ex-wow players in advance that they need to play Legion a few weeks first.</div></div><hr />

Pretty fucked up. Especially it is big selling point for new expansion. I imagine they will unlock them soon after BfA or even just before expansion launch. Why fuck returning/new players?<br />
<br />
As I said it many times:<br />
Allies Races are advertisied as unlockables and not as content that is directly available at launch.</div></div><hr />

You only need to do the requirements once on any character, regardless of race. However, you'll need a Horde character to do the story scenario to actually unlock them.<br />
<br />
Right, I plan on having a 110 horde char to do the intro quests. Just didn't know if the rep I have on my main will allow access to intro quests on the horde char.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can I race change instantly to Nightborne though when they get released?<br />
<br />
the tattoos do NOT need to be more visible. this is how they look on the npcs, like thalyssra. so this is how they should look on the player models.<br />
<br />
my big complaint are those goddamned eyes. that's not how nightborne eyes are supposed to look, so i really hope they get narrowed eventually.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otimus</div><div class="date">2018-01-29, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, if they're going to stick with that method of unlocking them post BfA launch, they shouldn't require BfA to play as nor be advertised as part of BfA. I know that'd never be the case, and I'm arguing semantics, but whatever. (I've also always hated how the revamped world was advertised as a perk of buying Cataclysm, constantly, fucking mega constantly in forums, when it didn't come with Cataclysm and anyone got it. So I'm a huge fan of arguing semantics!)<br />
<br />
I don't mind the requirements at all, but it's just a weird as fuck way to do it with a new expansion. IMHO, they should change these requirements to a different requirement after launch. I kinda think they will. I hope I'm right!</div></div><hr />

False. The trailer says &quot;Allied Races&quot;. Not &quot;grind months in old, irrelevant content on a character you dont want to unlock the one you do&quot;.</div></div><hr />

the original model shows how they're supposed to look.<br />

Doesn't matter what you have to do for it. They are new and you can play with them if you have BfA and the prerequisites.<br />
The BfA page states that.</div></div><hr />

That's your opinion.<br />
I like it how it is and I'm glad that they won't change it on launch.<br />
But they should increase the reputation gains at launch.</div></div><hr />

Lol. That’s honestly the silliest thing I’ve ever heard. You’re probably the type of person who also believes lore is unchangeable and never moves forward and even if Blizzard changes/advances lore it’s still vehemently wrong to your special snowflake ass haha</div></div><hr />

?<br />
<br />
the only requirement for heritage armor as far as we know is level to 100 naturally, as in no boosting or race changing. So you should get it regardless of whether or not you use heirlooms so long as you're doing the grind.</div></div><hr />

Liadrin saying that their people fought for this world while the Night Elves hid in dens and caves is beyond atrocious. <br />

It's fucking obvious that they would go Horde. The Blood Elves were sympathetic to them. The Night Elves just scorned them.</div></div><hr />
