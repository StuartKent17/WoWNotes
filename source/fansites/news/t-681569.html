Blue posts<br />
Cataclysm, Mastery, Passive Talents<br />
We're not going to be able to get all damage out of the trees. For example, Improved Frostbolt, a talent that makes Frostbolt cast faster is essentially a passive damage increase, but it does it in a more interesting way than a talent like Arctic Winds, which grants +Frost damage to keep it from being a PvP only talent.<br />
<br />
I don't know that Improved Overpower will make the cut, since you pretty much always want to Overpower when you can so it isn't that interesting a talent. Taste for Blood is an interesting talent even though it's pretty much just more damage at the end of the day. Trauma is not particularly interesting, but it's an important group buff which makes it marginally more interesting that a talent that just passively improves your own damage. Something like Deep Wounds is tough. It's pretty passive but it's also pretty iconic for the Arms tree. If crit chances are lower in Cataclysm, and they will be, then it's not the no-brainer it is today, but I still can't imagine an Arms build without it.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, what we want to do is just give players a lot more flexibility in how they talent. Some of the trees currently have a &quot;cookie cutter&quot; spec that says something like &quot;Spend the last 3 points wherever you want.&quot; We want to get that feel in all the trees, and hopefully with more like 5-8 points spent wherever you want. We also want to make sure you aren't able / forced to skip over the utility talents just to get the +damage, healing or survival talents.

Death Knight Tanking<br />
My comments above somehow got twisted into &quot;We want DKs to be OTs and not MTs.&quot; My actual post was that warriors are the most common MTs in progression-oriented guilds and my suspicion is that DKs are the most common OTs, though I acknowledged that I did not have the data to back that second part up.<br />
<br />
Now you can't have it two ways here. You can't say &quot;DKs are so terrible that they can only OT,&quot; while at the same time saying &quot;Guilds use warrior MTs even though they're terrible because they are either ignorant (unlikely) or stubborn (possible).&quot; I think a more credible conclusion is that tank balance isn't in such a dreadful state that it really affects what tanks groups use. They use the tanks they have or that their players like to play.<br />
<br />
Example: I asked a designer here whose guild is on heroic Anub 25 what tanks they use. They haven't beaten it yet, but they're close and they'll probably get it before 3.3. They use a DK MT and a warrior OT. I asked him why. It turned out their old warrior MT and paladin OT moved on and they used who they had left. They didn't feel the need to recruit or reroll to get say a paladin MT and druid OT. Now this is a sample size of one so it's hardly a trend. At the same time, I speak to a fair number of players and I think this kind of situation is typical. The relative strengths or weaknesses of the various classes and specs -- including dps and healers here, with a couple of exceptions like Subtlety rogues -- are not a huge factor in who gets brought to a raid. This seems to be true both of those groups that get server first kills and those guilds that come later but still defeat the toughest fights in the game before they are old content. That argues that the differences aren't that big a deal in the grand scheme of things.<br />
<br />
[...] I think this is a legit concern. While we don't want to give every tank class identical abilities, I do think DKs suffer from lacking something to fill the Shield Slam niche -- an on-demand high threat ability, great for smacking an add that has just arrived, but that can't be spammed to the exclusion of all else. Rune Strike isn't dependable enough and it is spammed anyway. However, it's pretty easy to conceive (and much harder to implement of course) of a Rune Strike that works more like Shield Slam, but with plenty of threat capable from other attacks. I think DK AE threat is fine, occasionally bordering on overpowered if you can get full use of DnD and Pestilence.

No, due to a high amount of our raiders visiting family and generally being away more than usual. I wanted the patch to come after things had settled down and people could focus on raiding again, as though its a regular time of year.</div></div><hr />

If your downloader loads into memory but seemingly does nothing, delete the background downloader file from ya WoW's folder, run a repair to get it restored, then manually click on the restored file. DO NOT run the launcher, for it will redownload the bugged file and your back where you started.<br />

Gratz Boomkins on the built-in counter-nerf that all the non-pessimists were expecting.<br />
<br />
Those who are calling this a 2% increase because of 2pT8 are ignoring the fact that you can, you know, WEAR your T10 in 3.3, thus having higher stats on your gear. So it's bigger than that.<br />
<br />
I mean, seriously, with 2pT8 at 7% if you continue to wear it when you get access to 4pT10, you're either a moron or so stubborn to make a point you're losing dps to do it, which probably makes you a moron anyway.<br />
<br />
So, gratz, your overall dps is about the same as it was before 3.3, you AREN'T stuck wearing 2 tier old gear, and you AREN'T required to use a particular addon or unintuitive playstyle (early buff /cancelaura use) to get that dps. Basically, your class got some things fixed and it didn't affect your dps. Kinda like the rogues.<br />
<br />
I don't expect you to stop acting like this is a nerf and bitching though. Carry on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
His answer was yesterday, US reset was also yesterday so his designer friend has plenty of time to down anub and release the patch, theoretically. But if he fails at anub, I doubt we have to wait another week.<br />
But an interesting thought, I already see the bluepost:<br />
<br />
We had some inconveniences with one of our designers, he and his guild weren't able to beat Anub'arak in 25 man heroic. To preserve Ghostcrawlers answer as true, we have to delay the patch 3.3 another week. We apologize and thank you for your continued patience.</div></div><hr />

Not how I understood it. The timer starts when you get an eclipse, so the cd will be over when eclipse is over, so if you got a Wrath eclipse, you can then proc a Starfire eclipse. Only the same eclipse as you just got has 30/15 sec cd.<br />
<br />
And this 10% extra is nice, I feel much better now. It's not a nerf or a bad fix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This accounts for the t8 2p bonus and probably (by my napkinmath) accounts for the dps loss from Wise too. While you won't gain much if you continue using the t8 2p, you will gain more if you upgrade to 4pt945 or t10, because you essentially have half the t8 2p bonus in-built now.<br />
<br />
Only thing is, the eclipse buff is not all roses and sunshine. As with the t8 2p bonus, we're now going to be close to the critcap again, so that becomes less valuable for us. Looks like we're gonna have to socket yet more spellpower and try to avoid both crit and haste in icecrown. Now thats gonna be hard.<br />

I think it's pretty annoying at the moment having to skip good stuff like instant howl of terror as affliction warlock or the snare talent as feral druid just to do some more damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
people skip them for pve content for the exact reason why you stated.. they do no extra damage, and are never used (or atleast hardly ever used) so if all you are doing is raiding that is wasted talent points. so how could being forced into taking utility talents that do nothing for your raid be a good thing?<br />
<br />
now of course instant howl of terror, and the snare talent for druids are great for pvp. and thats why people would spec talent points into them. but why force raiders to spec into pvp talents for their PvE builds?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps because by not HAVING dps options, you CAN spend points on those PvP talents, thus allowing you to not have to respec between the two.<br />
<br />
Or, because there isn't a third choice that just increases dps, your option is either instant howl of terror or, say, curse of exhaustion. Neither are useful very often in PvE, but maybe one or the other is useful in one boss each in an instance. You get more utility in either fight 3 or fight 7. Gratz. You have a meaningful choice.<br />
<br />
See, when your choice is between utility or dps, there is no meaningful choice, because for PvE you will always choose dps, and for PvP you will always choose utility. That's the very definition of cookie-cutter specs. No choices, because there's one best choice and no possible argument for any other options. Right now, the LEAST bloated specs have maybe 3 or 4 &quot;optional&quot; points. Most specs have just one optional point, or even none at all. The Cataclysm talent tree design is to make ALL points optional, or at least have 2-3 dozen optional points per spec. The idea is that your spec will be different from almost anyone else you run across. And neither of you are wrong.<br />
<br />
I don't see how there's a possible argument for how it can be a bad thing. You do know that EVERY point spent in any talent will increase your dps ~1% automatically thanks to masteries, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Avoid crit and haste? In gear? Cause you don't socket it, do you?<br />
<br />
<br />
Boomkins (as well as shadow priests, from what I've heard) are pretty close to, if not already past, soft caps for both haste *and* crit. The reason for this (for boomkins) is that one spell in their rotation has a very short base cast time (Wrath, at just 2 seconds) and the other spell in their rotation has a very high crit rate while they're casting it (Starfire, with +40% crit in 3.3 thanks to Eclipse). This means both haste and crit have very little value to them, so functionally all they're looking for is higher amounts of spellpower on their gear. This functions as a scaling problem, because no gear has just spellpower; everything has some amount of &quot;wasted&quot; (not really completely useless, but per point maybe 50% of the value of spellpower) spirit, haste, crit, or hit. Compared to a class that gets full value out of those stats (arcane mages for example, for whom haste is actually slightly MORE valuable per point than spellpower), boomkins will scale worse as their gear improves. Only some of the value of the ilvl spent on stats is being redeemed at full benefit.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way, if stats are &quot;spent&quot; evenly between the three available stats, and everyone gets full value out of spellpower, then if class A gets full value out of at least two stats other than spellpower (it doesn't have to be all; even if hit and crit are useless to a class, they can just focus on getting the haste/spirit gear), class B gets full value out of one other stat, and class C (boomkins) get full value out of nothing else, then (at 50% the value of spellpower per point for undervalued stats) class A gets 100% scaling through gear, class B gets 83.3%, and class C gets 66.7%. So even if dps in T9 gear is the same across these classes (already not the case), by the time they get full T10 gear their dps values are back out of sync (or further out of balance since they are already skewed in the same direction as the scaling issues).</div></div><hr />

dual-spec. one spec for pvp. one spec for pve. <br />
<br />
my problem with the blue post, and the guy i replied to is this <br />
<br />
&quot;We also want to make sure you aren't able / forced to skip over the utility talents just to get the +damage, healing or survival talents&quot;<br />
<br />
I as a DPS warrior who doesnt pick up say second wind, or blood craze because there are very very few to no situations that i would end up getting any benefit from spending those points. no one forces me not to pick them up, i choose not to. Blizzard telling me &quot;hey we want you to pick up those talents to make you waste points as an easy way to nerf your dps&quot; is not a choice, or an option. i say again. why force me to pick up pvp talents that i will never use in pve content?<br />
<br />
i swear with every bit of news about cataclysm from the devs fingertips pushes me further and further away from wanting to buy it. there is just no good reason why they had to completely disembowel the talent, and stat system's. i already went through this kind of crap with a little game called SWG twice before, and i'm not too keen to make a trip down fail memory lane a third time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your dps isn't being nerfed. There ARE no &quot;wastes&quot; of points anymore. The dps is being automatically baked into every talent in the tree. Basically, instead of adding &quot;each point also increases your dps by 1%&quot; to the end of every utility talent, and adding utility to the talents that currently *only* increase dps, they're giving mastery bonuses based on number of talent points spent and letting the talent tooltips only talk about the utility part.<br />
<br />
That's where the MORE choice, not less argument comes from. Right now you don't choose to skip those talents. You're forced to because that's the only way to maximize your dps. Additionally, even &quot;PvP talents&quot; have a use in PvE once in a blue moon. You'd get to press that button, and have something more to do than your normal rotation, at least in that rare encounter where that utility you got to choose comes in handy. Basically the idea here isn't &quot;we're taking away dps, ha ha!&quot; it's &quot;dps is baked in, choose between utility A and utility B&quot;. Let's say they just gave you a 72nd talent point, made second wind and blood craze one point each, and said you could ONLY spend that point on one or the other of those (just because I don't feel like coming up with 15 other choices, NONE of which are &quot;adds 1% damage&quot;, like you'll have in Cataclysm). Well, there's no real choice there either. You'd go with Second Wind, because if you get crit in a boss fight you're dead because you aggroed, but you DO get stunned or immobilized in boss fights on occasion. So bad example. But the idea is that you'd have options that are at least minimally useful in boss fights, EVERY talent will give damage, so you get to choose which options you'd like of the stuff that right now you consider PvP-only.<br />
<br />
It's more of a &quot;here's more free points&quot; thing than a &quot;you have less options&quot; thing. You won't have to spend 67 of your 71 points just on maximizing your dps, so you have more points to spend on non-dps options.</div></div><hr />

All of 3.0 and all of 3.2? The only time they weren't the top choice was 3.1 where DKs just shined (because they were overpowered).

Ultimately, what we want to do is just give players a lot more flexibility in how they talent.

People will always spec whichever is the most optimal talent spec. Even with a few talent points free there will be an optimal spec for dps/tanking/healing and that is what players will use, and 3-4 extra talent points used on random talents that make no real difference to it won't make it unique.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first 4 bosses will not be hard by any means for your average guild. I guess we may get to raid 1 full night a week (3-4 hours) instead of just 2 hours in ToC and TocGC.<br />
<br />
Also the 5 mans are not hard and are implied to be gated just like the raid according to a feedback thread.<br />

<br />
<br />
Lets not forget the PTR is used to have bosses with mods with -30% health / damage, since the PTR is to test mechanics, and not boss difficulty in terms of numbers, and you cant test shit if people dies on said boss, including NubJoe because he may be stupid enough to try something that bugs the boss.</div></div><hr />

You have a strange idea of &quot;average&quot;, last I heard it meant the mean value. The majority of guilds haven't finished ULD25 or TOTC25. The content won't be time consuming for decent guilds, but it will take the majority of people a week or two to clear the first section in all likelihood.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HOWEVER with the layered progression and the fact that Christmas is around the corner and all but the world first guilds aren't going to tell their families to fuck off so they can play games, I will have a little bit more time to get my work schedule straightened out so I can raid. The layered progression will help with the guild not blasting through the content so I can learn with the rest again. <br />
<br />
Though I still think the entire way they're doing it is a cheap cop-out, it may work in my favor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WHat's the DPS requirements?<br />
<br />
My GL is trying to tell me that we need to stick to ToC25, go onto ToGC and stay in... urgh... Ulduar for other raid nights. We had a raid night fall apart because no one would focus. My GL doesn't like hearing it, but I do think it is because Ulduar, while having some upgrades for some people, just generally has no interest after doing it for 6 months. <br />
<br />
They claim we need 5k per person for our main DPS to even see it. We have 8-10 people in the +4.5k constantly, with another 4-5 that can do 4k regularly. We have a few slightly undergeared right now, mostly people who've changed mains. I claim that given how we progressed in ToC, we're going to be fine doing the early bosses in IC and do ToC and ToGC. Plus, we will get people geared up to ToC levels much faster when we get Trumiphs, and when we can get people out of ToC. As IC unlocks, we can go further.<br />
<br />
What is your guys' opinions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That Blue post you refer to did not actually say they had a month to go to get the 3.3 PTR ready.<br />
<br />
It was a post in the tech support forums talking about problems with the first pre patch download.<br />
<br />
What the tech support rep actually said was <br />
<br />
&quot;You have about +1 month to download this file&quot;<br />
<br />
He did not say &quot;You have a month to get all the prepatch data before<br />
the patch hits&quot; nor did he say &quot;The patch will be out in a month&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This file&quot; refers to wow-partial-1.mpq that people were having problems downloading.<br />
<br />
So what he actually said was &quot;You have about +1 month to download the file wow-partial-1.mpq&quot;<br />
<br />
What I believe he meant (a point many people are choosing to ignore) is that the pre-patch downloads will probably be up on the background downloader for a month or so before Blizzard turn around and just put up a 3.2.2 - 3.3 patch and a 3.3 Universal patch.<br />
<br />
I think they are doing it this way so people who may not have all the partial files can still download what they need to get on. IE If they have one of the partial files but not all of them. The partial files are pretty big after all. It would a shame to waste people's<br />
bandwidth but them not being able to complete their pre patch<br />
downloading.<br />
<br />
EDIT : Also there have been patches released before mid way through an Arena Season.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't imagine why any guild leader would want to keep dragging people through Ulduar once ICC comes out unless he's just sadistic or is using the guild to try and finish off a Val'anyr for himself.<br />
<br />
At the very least you guys would be better off breaking down into 10 man groups to do ICC-10 if your DPS/gear level is enough for ToC 25 but not for ICC 25. At least it will be new content, much better gear, and good practice for when you can do ICC 25.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your feedback. There's a long boring cool story bro behind it, but we started ToC25 very late - we only downed Anub for the first time a month and a half ago. We've had him on farm pretty much, and this week was the first time we did it all in one sitting (though the GL complained that some of the early fights were messy - one wipe I don't think is &quot;Messy&quot; - and that it took longer then it should have). Personally, I think people stretch it out just to avoid Udular. <br />
<br />
We have been running 10 mans, but we don't do DKP on them like on our 25 man content. They are strictly roll-off events. Which means I'll never see that stupid Death's Choice trinket from 10 man Faction... Grrr.</div></div><hr />
