Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
What were some of the most important things you learned from WoW that help you become a better designer on LoL?<br />
I tried to just come up with a few off the top of my head:<br />
<br />
1) I got better at constructing my written communication to try to get players to understand that we really do understand their point of view and care. It’s really easy in this position to come across as too academic or out of touch.<br />
<br />
2) It’s easy as a designer to get in the habit of pushing for elegance at the cost of other things. Sometimes a design just isn’t going to be really elegant if it needs to meet certain goals or solve certain problems. I liken this to a programmer who ends up authoring code that they personally find ugly, but that solves the exact problem they need to solve.<br />
<br />
3) Likewise, it’s easy to get in the habit of making a change because it’s the right change for the game without keeping in mind the impact it’s going to have on players. For example, if you’ve had one rule that you’ve been using for years, and eventually come up with a better rule, that doesn’t mean you should immediately implement that rule. Maybe it would be hard for players to adapt to the new rule. Maybe the new rule is better design in a strictly objective sense, but it isn’t as fun as the older design.<br />
<br />
In WoW, as a player I always enjoyed dungeons and raids the most out of any content in the game. What I really enjoyed was the problem-solving aspect. “We don’t have a mage for Polymorph, so how can we make that 5 pull?” That sort of thing. <br />
<br />
As a player, I didn’t enjoy the late Wrath dungeons where we just AE’d everything down and the tank was running ahead into the next room. Why should my healer have single-target heals and group heals if I only ever used the group heal? Why should I have crowd control abilities if I never used them? What interesting decisions was I making if I approached 2 pulls, 5 pulls and the boss with the same tool set. <br />
<br />
So I advocated (and largely got) Cataclysm dungeons that required using the full tool set. You had to strategize and not just run through the dungeon. <br />
<br />
4) As a player and a designer, I am pretty tolerant of RNG as a mechanic. I have come to appreciate that many players are less tolerant of it than I expect, so I can’t always trust my own judgment there without some level of introspection and using other developers as sounding boards. It’s kind of like knowing you have bad eyesight so asking someone else what that word is that you can’t make out.<br />
<br />
5) You have to pick your battles. There are probably 60 things that you want to improve in your game, but you can’t get to them all and still do a good job on those improvements. It’s better to target a mix of low-hanging fruit (meaning easy-to-fix things that players will still feel) and a few big ticket items (meaning hard-to-fix things that players will definitely feel). Hard-to-implement and limited impact is the kiss of death for a feature, as it should be.<br />
<br />
6) Try and avoid even in the hint of favoritism. I still get blamed for buffing Frost mages (which is a class I never played) and nerfing Ret paladins (which was a forum joke that somehow became accepted as reality). I just don’t answer questions about which champions I play the most in LoL. <br />
<br />
7) As a lead and a manager, I got a lot better at resolving when I need to stand back and let someone try out a crazy idea. The chance of failure may be high, but they’ll learn something from the experience, assuming there isn’t a very high cost for players. (For example, trying something out before a change goes live with plenty of time to revert can still be “expensive” in terms of wasted developer time but may not impact players much except for the wasted dev time.) On the other hand, there are some times you need to jump in and catch what could be a horrible mistake. I follow the general rule of not catching someone who is about to skin their knee, but definitely catching them if they’re about to break their neck.

Yeah, and it turned out so well. /s<br />
<br />
<br />
And I think his thinking then/now is mixed up. The ICC dungeons were still no cakewalk in LFD even if the average person in the group had an item level of 251 (in the 232 version). It was the 3.0 heroics where you'd pull an entire room and mow them down with AoE. And why not, since people were rocking ICC 25 gear in ilvl 200 heroics. If there were anything to be blamed for this, it was the ballooning stat values in WotLK (which Blizzard explicitly admitted its failure to control). Towards the end of the expansion, for example, 100% armor penetration wasn't unheard of (albeit not easily reached).<br />

Dungeons are the other bread-and-butter when it comes to endgame in PvE, and it's sad to see that other than high level Mythic+, it's still just mindless. And leveling, just as with dungeons, you don't have to think. Put damage abilities on actionbar and gogogogogogogoggogogogogogogogogogo and hopefully dinging every 11 minutes will keep you entertained.<br />
<br />
Sadly it can't easily be reversed, and people would just bitch and moan about dungeons taking longer if Blizzard made radical changes to mob/boss health and damage in order to avoid it in further expansions... when a lot of the issue with why everyone wants them over with quickly is because they are so mindnumbingly easy you fall asleep. But whenever you try to argue that you miss doing things like sapping/trapping, you just get rebuttals of &quot;lul well i just wanna finish the dungeon cc doesn't require any skill lul&quot;<br />
Well at least it activates parts of the brain. When mobs actually can pose a threat, things get interesting. When key mobs use very dangerous abilities your toolkits become relevant.<br />
<br />
But alas, it's more important to make sure that every group is 100% viable. Heaven forbid a group realizes no one has Polymorph. How did we ever survive classic and BC.<br />
<br />
It's a result of snowballing design over years. If you want a challenge anywhere in WoW you can only find it in organized raids or high keystones. Everything else is made to be guaranteed success for the new kind of MMO player that rather whine than improve.</div></div><hr />

Yes unfortunately it is a pandora's box scenario I suppose at the time it was seen that have a group of complete strangers would be asking too much in terms of CCing.. Unfortunately in catering to that it has made the normal/heroic dungeon a blur of action then finished.. What will be interesting is 7.2 and the upping of the item level requirement for heroic dungeons but will see..</div></div><hr />

<br />
CC is just for making the game really fucking annoying in pvp now, ah yes thank you demon hunter for stunning me for a total 8 seconds and interrupting when i tried to cast, that 10 seconds of my keyboard doing sweet FUCK ALL felt good.<br />
<br />
i mean i guess CC is used in mythic+ but its more aoe stuns aoe slows not the original hex this sap that sheep that trap that, hunter you kite those 2 mobs when we've killed these FD and they'll come running back tank will pick them up or we can sheep 1 kill 1 etc. only way to bring that back is trash literally 4 shotting tanks so you can't even handle 4 melee swings but no tank is going to enjoy that anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of players enjoyed this change. However, some did not, and their response surprised me. For these players, they didn’t want dungeons that were stressful. For them, running through a dungeon and blowing everything up with very low risk was a nice way to unwind and chill with friends after what may have been a stressful day of real life. If I had been a better designer, I should have anticipated this response. <br />
<br />
I don’t think the right answer would have been to nerf all of the content. I think the right answer was to make sure the “interesting decision / strategy” crowd and the “chill / blow shit up” crowd both had content suitable for them.</div></div><hr />

Because you were the name everyone knew, and Cata didn't hit Ret Paladins with the retard stick, they hit Ret Paladin's with the entire retard tree. Repeatedly. God, early Cata Ret Paladin was as shit and unfun as BC Ret Paladin, and moving into later Cata, it stayed just as unfun but at least the numbers weren't still a bad joke.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, and it turned out so well. /s<br />
<br />
I find it hilarious that something so much easier than BC heroics caused so many tears. Sadly, Wrath trained the player base to expect every dungeon run to be a complete and effortless success. So honestly, Cata dungeons turned out quite well for me :D<br />
<br />
<br />
It was the 3.0 heroics where you'd pull an entire room and mow them down with AoE. And why not, since people were rocking ICC 25 gear in ilvl 200 heroics.<br />
<br />
Dude, we AoE'd entire rooms in heroics before we even started Naxx. Wrath dungeons were a complete joke, except for Occulus since you had to be not-retarded, and that was an extremely high bar for most the player base.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. Well, now they do. High M+ runs. <br />
<br />
They just haven't tuned the difficulty/affixes/timers correctly. Timers should be more lenient, but foes more punishing at higher levels, so that CC is necessary.</div></div><hr />

I like M+, but I think Blizz should add an affix that would punish people for CCing, so it'd turn things into &quot;gogogo on steroids&quot;... Some people will like it, others will hate it :p<br />
<br />
Problem w/ current M+ system is that people prefer to use lower level keys, just because they can roflstomp everything in there, many people don't want to do M+ of an appropriate level, they just want easy and smooth runs. Guys who should be doing M+25, are running M+20 and lower, CC is irrelevant in this case....<br />
<br />
M+ system should reward people for pushing as hard/far as they can.</div></div><hr />

And I think his thinking then/now is mixed up. The ICC dungeons were still no cakewalk in LFD even if the average person in the group had an item level of 251 (in the 232 version). It was the 3.0 heroics where you'd pull an entire room and mow them down with AoE. And why not, since people were rocking ICC 25 gear in ilvl 200 heroics. If there were anything to be blamed for this, it was the ballooning stat values in WotLK (which Blizzard explicitly admitted its failure to control). Towards the end of the expansion, for example, 100% armor penetration wasn't unheard of (albeit not easily reached).<br />
<br />
/rant<br />
<br />
While I tepidly agree that Wrath dungeon difficulty were diminished due to the inflating stat issue (Though I'd argue they didn't take much thought even at launch.) I'm tempted to ask what you thought was wrong with the Cataclysm heroics. In my experience, they were incredibly fun to do and massively rewarding to beat. I was always struck and dumbfounded at the community response to them in the past.</div></div><hr />

And yeah, OF COURSE the casuals are going to want to blow through those dungeons and relax after their day. That's what they do; they come in droves to some of the best video games ever released, then encrust themselves within and ruin everything.<br />
<br />
Fun fact: Vanilla primarily targeted an audience of players in their twenties, who already had jobs and were well on their way to saving up for a mortgage at the time. Vanilla was a HUGE success. So why the sudden shift toward accommodating those players who only have 1-2 hours to play per day, despite the general truism that WoW's audience has only been getting younger? Did the vocal minority drown out reality, or is there something we don't know?</div></div><hr />

Wrong. Sorry, but when one mistake = wipe, then there is no room for actually playing the game and learning game mechanics. There is no learning curve - it's just brick wall. Yeah, there are hardcore games, like Battletoads, where one mistake = death and therefore whole game is one big trial'n'error-fest. But overall - it's BAD GAME DESIGN, because hardcore tryhards - are minority. For example ICC heroics were hard, but at the same time mistakes didn't cause instant wipes - players were able to continue playing the game and learning fight, till healer wasn't going OOM. They were able to ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME - not perform endless corpse-run-fest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
CC is dead, even in mythic +20 you're not going to CC anything because thats a dps loss to kill 1 mob instead of aoe a pack and you're against a timer.<br />
<br />
CC is just for making the game really fucking annoying in pvp now, ah yes thank you demon hunter for stunning me for a total 8 seconds and interrupting when i tried to cast, that 10 seconds of my keyboard doing sweet FUCK ALL felt good.<br />
<br />
i mean i guess CC is used in mythic+ but its more aoe stuns aoe slows not the original hex this sap that sheep that trap that, hunter you kite those 2 mobs when we've killed these FD and they'll come running back tank will pick them up or we can sheep 1 kill 1 etc. only way to bring that back is trash literally 4 shotting tanks so you can't even handle 4 melee swings but no tank is going to enjoy that anymore.<br />

Last time i used CC was in TBC Heroics ^^<br />
<br />
I remember having CC in some parts of Cata Heroics, like the humanoid packs before the last boss in Vortex Pinnacle, and also have used CC in Wrath HCs - even in random groups after LFD was introduced. But nothing comes near the use of CC in TBC heroics, which also have been much more fun to me, especially Magister's Terrace (granted, I have always played mage as my main, most of the time frost mage for extra roots and kiting possibilities). Pulling trash mobs together and aoe'ing them down may be fun for some people, but I rather would have to kill less trash packs, but with more focus on priority targets and CC / interrupts than mindless aoe.<br />

Less trash packs could do the trick to save time if you have to go the CC/focus target route.<br />
<br />
I also would not mind harder dungeons taking 30-60 minutes if the rewards would be worthwile. But since dungeon loot is still mostly useless and having multiple layers of randomness in it, this is a totally different can of worms. At least, with badges you could get gear upgrades even if you don't get dungeon drops. With random upgrades, you can end up in a situation where you would have gotten some upgrades via badges after a set number of runs, but with bad luck, you get nothing worthwile in terms of random upgrades. It's so obviously created to waste people's times, that I will not buy into it and rather play a different character than to gamble on my main.</div></div><hr />

At this point, the changes necessary to make this a different experience are so extensive they're unlikely to ever happen. One big problem is the fact that people WANT bite-sized content. They want their &quot;sessions&quot; to be easily divisible into small chunks, which is why a dungeon taking 60 minutes would never be a reality outside of a very dedicated demographic. They want things to go fast, about 15-25 minutes ideally - but that in turn means you cannot tune rewards to be substantial, as farming them would become trivial. An ARPG-style RNG-based system is the obvious consequence, as we can observe right now. That is just a fundamental problem of the gearing system, which requires various gates in order to modulate progression rates (e.g. with raids it's the weekly lockout). The badges/JP system is one possible counter (especially with a cap), however that system has proven somewhat unpopular in the past as rewards don't &quot;feel&quot; right if they're just X currency. Nevermind the fact that it's at least some form of meaningful cumulative reward, people just don't like earning numbers. They prefer chucking the n-th useless item that didn't roll TF, despite the obvious inefficiencies. What other system there could be to combine both... well, that is quite the design challenge. I think it's also connected to more, fundamental issues about the game and a quick fix is likely not possible. At this point, I'm waiting to see what the next expansion brings, as I'm sure they have learned now that running 250 Maw of Soul keys in a week is not what people had in mind when they wanted dungeons to matter again.</div></div><hr />

I would not deny that I like fast dungeon runs in the LFD tool, this is what it's for. Quickly assemble a group, get through a dungeon without much hassle. Ideal for doing quests or finishing objectives like running 100 dungeons for a hidden skin colour variant. And I was hoping that mythic dungeons in Legion would be more like heroics in TBC, but unfortunately, they are more like mythics in WoD combined with CMs, which I did not liked that much. We already have the GoGoGo! mentality in LFD heroics, it's sad that we technically have the same approach to mythics, where overgearing the place is more important than knowledge of different mobs and their abilities a.k.a. strategy of a dungeon.</div></div><hr />

Fully agreed, however the underlying dilemma remains. If you make dungeons longer and super hard, people will want a reason to run it, i.e. a good reward. Good rewards make people want them, which in turn causes a lot of complaints from people that can't or won't put in the effort required to beat the hard dungeon. It also causes inflation because people who CAN get those rewards will get a lot of them, because dungeons lack the moderator of weekly lockouts like raids do. And if you put dungeons on a lockout, people complain they don't have enough to do, or that they want something to chain-run for rewards. Etc.<br />
<br />
The problem is really deeply rooted in the way gearing works. For the longest time, WoW simply had two basic tiers of gear: raid gear, and everything else. If you raided, there was little reason to ever run dungeons. They tried addressing that with currencies, which failed for obvious reasons (see earlier post). Next came the current system of RNG loot, which also has some inherent flaws. And the problem of making both dungeons AND raids matter to the same people remains.<br />
<br />
I don't really have a solution in mind that isn't a radical overhaul of the entire gear system. I also think that speedrun mechanics or mentalities add another critical dimension that exacerbates certain problems, though I am equally at a loss as to how to address that issue.</div></div><hr />

There is no solution, because the players won't change.<br />

As a player, I didn’t enjoy the late Wrath dungeons where we just AE’d everything down and the tank was running ahead into the next room. Why should my healer have single-target heals and group heals if I only ever used the group heal? Why should I have crowd control abilities if I never used them? What interesting decisions was I making if I approached 2 pulls, 5 pulls and the boss with the same tool set.<br />
<br />
So I advocated (and largely got) Cataclysm dungeons that required using the full tool set. You had to strategize and not just run through the dungeon.<br />
Yeah, and it turned out so well. /s<br />
<br />
<br />
And I think his thinking then/now is mixed up. The ICC dungeons were still no cakewalk in LFD even if the average person in the group had an item level of 251 (in the 232 version). It was the 3.0 heroics where you'd pull an entire room and mow them down with AoE. And why not, since people were rocking ICC 25 gear in ilvl 200 heroics. If there were anything to be blamed for this, it was the ballooning stat values in WotLK (which Blizzard explicitly admitted its failure to control). Towards the end of the expansion, for example, 100% armor penetration wasn't unheard of (albeit not easily reached).<br />
<br />

<br />
Yeah. No. Every group I was in was AOEing in every dungeon starting from release. It was a problem for me, well, a problem for other players, because as a rogue, AoE isn't our strong suit. I once offered to cc a mob, and got threatened with a kick. I was shocked in the first dungeon I ran, because stuff was dying do fast, I couldn't get to them in time to get any damage on the meters, I had to stealth up to them ahead of the pack with the tank to get any stabs in.<br />

Making dungeons into pure AoE fests is one of the biggest mistakes WoW has done. Dungeons are the other bread-and-butter when it comes to endgame in PvE, and it's sad to see that other than high level Mythic+, it's still just mindless. And leveling, just as with dungeons, you don't have to think. Put damage abilities on actionbar and gogogogogogogoggogogogogogogogogogo and hopefully dinging every 11 minutes will keep you entertained.<br />
<br />
Sadly it can't easily be reversed, and people would just bitch and moan about dungeons taking longer if Blizzard made radical changes to mob/boss health and damage in order to avoid it in further expansions... when a lot of the issue with why everyone wants them over with quickly is because they are so mindnumbingly easy you fall asleep. But whenever you try to argue that you miss doing things like sapping/trapping, you just get rebuttals of &quot;lul well i just wanna finish the dungeon cc doesn't require any skill lul&quot;<br />
Well at least it activates parts of the brain. When mobs actually can pose a threat, things get interesting. When key mobs use very dangerous abilities your toolkits become relevant.<br />
<br />
But alas, it's more important to make sure that every group is 100% viable. Heaven forbid a group realizes no one has Polymorph. How did we ever survive classic and BC.<br />
<br />
It's a result of snowballing design over years. If you want a challenge anywhere in WoW you can only find it in organized raids or high keystones. Everything else is made to be guaranteed success for the new kind of MMO player that rather whine than improve.<br />
<br />
I remember in vanilla, running BRD with my guild, for attunements, Dark Iron rep, and the forge. We'd break it up, over two nights, or when we could, just spend 6 hours in there, only to end up wiping to the emperor over and over - but we had fun, used all of our abilities (locking picking ftw!) and never complained.<br />
<br />
Today's snowflakes would ragequit, &quot;It's taking to LOOOOOONG&quot;. They'd never have gotten through Uldaman, or Scholomance, let alone Dire Maul or doing a complete clear of Blackrock, all 3 instances, like we'd do on occasion. <br />
<br />
They call it &quot;dungeon crawling&quot; for a reason, not &quot;dungeon sprinting&quot;.</div></div><hr />

INTO THE GROUND!<br />
<br />
I miss the wide array of utility that classes used to have and needed to use. Even in Mists it was fun to be on the &quot;devo aura&quot; rotation on Thok with my Ret paladin or throwing out hand of Sac when someone got hit with something or Salv when a healer pulled aggro. It made me feel like more than just stick to hit things with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've always been playing a game where mages are capable of keeping one NPC sheeped for an indefinite period of time. In the early days, you had to sheep enemies to survive certain pulls, but it was a meaningless choice and simply a chore - not fun. So they got rid of that and there was no reason to sheep at all.<br />
<br />
The answer is to fundamentally change how CC like polymorph works. The way it is used in PvP is more fun and interesting because it has a limited duration and diminishing returns. You don't start every PvP battle by sheeping and you can't just keep someone sheeped permanently.<br />
<br />
If CC in PVE worked similarly, they could design more interesting trash encounters. Instead of the extreme opposite ends of the spectrum where you are sheeping things indefinitely and killing them one at a time, or neglecting to sheep at all, there would be a middle ground where the players are deciding when to CC and how often, especially if there are different kinds of CC. For instance, a CC that can be kept up indefinitely but requires the players to channel has some interesting trade off. A moderately long CC that costs a lot of mana or has a long cooldown. They can have other variations that affect more targets but don't last as long, etc.<br />
<br />
Raid encounters could also be more interesting with such varied CC mechanics available. Right now CC is almost never used as a mechanic in raid encounters because, again, it's not interesting and fun for the players.</div></div><hr />

No they did not in LFG -- and if you claim otherwise I'll straight up call you a liar. You are confused. In every other dungeon they did but then again odds are you significantly out-geared it too, which is something people often forget.<br />
<br />
HoR, for example, had no trash until post-LK and then it was more of a gauntlet. Not everyone completed the gauntlet. I remember because there was some loot that only dropped off LK in there and we rarely even got to that part much less completed it.<br />
<br />
PoS, for example, you couldn't get ridiculous. You didn't need to CC but you couldn't pull insanely until, wait for it, you out-geared it.<br />
<br />
FoS wasn't too bad but the bosses themselves weren't the jokes that the other Wrath dungeons were.<br />
<br />
In the other Wrath dungeons I could pull the trash up to, and including, the bosses. After I out-geared them. Not the ICC dungeons you seem to claim.<br />
<br />
Notice the pattern here? It's ridiculous to out-gear something and then complain how &quot;easy&quot; it is. It's also dishonest.<br />
<br />
edit: And it would be easy for you to prove me wrong. Show me youtube videos, dated accordingly, that I'm wrong. It should be a simple matter to show pre-ICC (dungeon and raid) gear and tell if they aren't in comms (it's not like people in LFG were willing to jump in comms back then, for a dungeon).</div></div><hr />

Yeah, he really nerfed Paladins. Problem was - they really needed this nerfs. He was blamed for this just because tons of kids got used to have 3 lives (Bubble, LOH), SP from AP, that allowed them to heal to full HP via just one cast, best CC in game - stun, passive healing, debuff to enemy's stats, being just unstoppable due to Freedom, being one of the best and almost mandatory tank and healer and many other cool things. And this kids of course didn't want to play not such cheating class.</div></div><hr />
