Patch 5.3 Dev Interview<br />
Today we are taking a look at an interview over on Game Diplomat (http://gamediplomat.com/wow-pet-battle-interview-patch-5-3-with-cory-stockton/) with Cory Stockton.<br />
<br />
Pet Battles<br />
<br />
There aren't any developers that work only on pet battles, so the entire team contributes. <br />
The Lurker Below was going to be a Patch 5.3 battle pet, but it didn't look good when scaled down.<br />
Patch 5.3 enhanced pet battle PvP because players were interested in the PvP side of pet battles, doing things like forming tournaments.<br />
A very large percentage of level 90 players are doing pet battles, or at least trying them. <br />
Patch 5.4 will let you see the health of pets when other players are doing pet battles in the world, as the spectating (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3239-Patch-5-3-Pet-Battle-Spectating-Blue-Tweets-Riot-Toxic-Player-Behavior-Fan-Art) added in 5.3 does not let you target any of the pets.<br />
If players are enthusiastic about pet battle PvP, there will have to be more focus on pet balance than there is now.<br />
Miss and Dodge had been recognized as a problem since Patch 5.1 and were going to be addressed in Patch 5.2, but the devs ran out of time. The changes were finally put into place in Patch 5.3.<br />
Pets dropping from old raid bosses worked well, as most people enjoyed collecting them.<br />
Wrath of the Lich King raid bosses would be next for pet drops after the second set of Burning Crusade raid bosses get pets. This isn't guaranteed though, as there aren't solid plans in place yet for when the second set of Burning Crusade raid bosses will get pets.<br />
Catching a Unborn Val'kyr (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/71163-unborn-valkyr) will affect the spawn time and location of the next one.<br />

Patch 5.4 Battle Pet Abilities Adjustments<br />
Thank you to everyone who has shared their feedback with us so far, we appreciate it. Based on some of the comments we’ve received, here is an updated list of potential changes we’re hoping to include in Patch 5.4:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Magic passive now caps damage taken at 35% of maximum health, buffed from 40%. The Dragonkin passive effect now activates when the enemy is taken below 50% health, up from 25%. The Aquatic passive now reduces DOT damage by 50%, up from 25%. The Elemental passive effect now only affect negative, direct effects of weather (e.g. the accuracy reduction of Sandstorm won’t be applied, but the damage reduction will). The Critter passive now makes critters completely immune to roots, stuns, and sleeps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep that feedback rollin’ in!<br />

Running Out of Bag Space<br />
Adding more space to put more stuff isn't a solution, it's just delaying the problem, and usually not by much. We've been talking about (and even telling all y'all) that solving the storage problem is something we've set our sights on. Of course I'm not going to make an announcement here so no specifics to share yet, or when that relief may surface, but it is something we want to tackle asap. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/261614-mo-bag-space-please/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8891939941?page=2#22))<br />

4 set pve bonus &gt; pvp Bonus<br />
pls i don't wanna be forced into pve to compete in pvp versus players that take the advantage of pve equip versus pvp. <br />
Firstly, I never said you had to. Secondly, PvE items are worse than PvP gear for instanced PvP. Thirdly, I said that if any outliers were found, we would investigate and make adjustments if we deem it necessary. Fourthly, I said that our goal was for PvP gear to be the best for PvP.<br />
<br />
excuse me but I feel cheated! <br />
Because raiders and freshly dinged level 90 characters are able to more easily enter the PvP scene, increasing participation and reducing queue times?<br />
<br />
Your issue is that you feel PvE gear is a clear winner over PvP gear, I can assure you that PvP gear is better in pretty much all cases. There may be a few exceptions to this, but they are at best an incredibly minor increase in damage, but you sacrifice other bonuses to get that minor damage increase. All in all, no PvE items are a clear upgrade to PvP gear with almost all of them being a downgrade. To quote my last post: &quot;If we find some PvE gear that is clearly outperforming PvP gear in instanced PvP, we will investigate it and take action if it's deemed necessary.&quot;<br />
<br />
The difference so far is so minimal that pvp players feel shafted and feel as if they have grinded PVP gear for little to no difference when in competition with PVE players. <br />
I think that an additional 35% damage through PvP power is definitely nothing to be sneezed at. <br />
<br />
PVP gear feels useless, PVPing feels pointless. There is no reward, pvp players feels like they are always on par if not worse off than that of pve players. Just READ the forums, look at how people are feeling, screw the statistics, look at how fed up the PVP player base is with these changes! <br />
I read this forum daily and I can tell you that I am well aware of the communities feelings on the topic and I do share some of those feelings and concerns as a PvP'er myself. However, many of the arguments that are used are either not rationalized, done in the heat of the moment with no reasoning and don't take into account all of the facts. We post here to try and help clearing up those concerns and preventing information that helps as well as passing on all of the feedback that we get and the developers regularly incorporate that feedback into design decisions.<br />
<br />
Honour gear is USELESS!, it is POINTLESS. Anyone who grinds out honour for malevolent gear is kicking themselves in the teeth. <br />
Why is it pointless? As I gear up a new alt, I use the honor gear and I find that while it is not optimal, it suffices till I get conquest gear. Honor gear to Conquest gear is a basic path of progression for gearing and without it you end up with the flipside of the coin: If there is no progression path for gearing, then some of the enjoyment is gone for players losing that opportunity to increase their characters power. You start out, you run battlegrounds to get honor and a bit of conquest on the side which you use to buy gear that allows you to participate in arena and RBG's, the conquest you get from that then goes into Conquest gear. <br />
<br />
If you are struggling to find partners or teams, there are sources you can use to find some. You can use the &quot;Looking for players - PvP&quot; forum, Arena Junkies forums, General chat, Anook, Teamfind, your guild and more. The main idea is just to find like-minded players to play with.<br />
<br />
Its just terrible at the moment, whats the point, i'm asking you, right now Nakatoir, WHY should i PVP when there is NO gear, NO rewards and a stalemate at 2k rating! <br />
The progression pathing for gear has not really changed, crafted to honor to conquest, just the Elite weapon has been toned down to avoid ilvl inflation and gear disparity. So there is gear, 3 sets of it different sets. There are rewards, the PvP enchant, the cloak, the tabard, the elite gear and end-of-season rewards. We are also looking to add more rewards into PvP in the future.<br />
<br />
I accept that the 2k rating push and beyond is a challenge, but it's not impossible. If you already have full Tyrannical, then it is simply a matter of skill and knowledge of the game that is holding you back. Just keep trying, learning from mistakes and pushing to get better and you will break past that window.

If you don't like pet battles; Don't do them.<br />

I suggest you check http://www.warcraftpets.com and see how many people actually like pet battles. Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean nobody does. Obviously enough people actually play them to warrant Dev time spend on fixing bugs and balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huhu's Stinger has always looked questionable, at best.<br />
<br />
Also: could we all try to be a little less twelve years old when it comes to handling the idea that this game is huge and has many aspects of it that appeals to different types of gameplay?<br />
<br />
I hate doing PvP in this game, but I don't throw a fit each time they put in PvP content or changes, as I don't see most PvP people throw fits about each time a new raid, dungeon or scenario is brought out. The patches for MoP have been coming out once every 3 months -- a huge improvement over the past -- all while all those devs are on the side making changes for the Pet Battles, thus making a strong case against there being some sort of zero-sum conspiracy against your favorite whatever in WoW.<br />
<br />
And about Pet Battles having a broad appeal -- or a large percentage of players participating. It's just like scenarios and arenas have broad appeal. Broad appeal doesn't have to mean 90% of players, or even 50% of players. But even if this is just say.... 10% of players, that's a huge amount of people, and that's content that's worth developing. I mean, hell, Game of Thrones has broad appeal with their season 3 premiere having just 6.7 million viewers (link (http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/04/01/game-of-thrones-premiere-ratings-3/)) out of.... how many cable viewers? There's well over 60 million premium cable subscribers just in the US alone (see here (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television_in_the_United_States#Statistics)). Capturing the sustained attention of even 10% of that many people isn't something to scoff at. And 10% of 8 to 10 million people isn't something to scoff at either.<br />
<br />
Just something worth keeping in mind.</div></div><hr />

As people have said, don't do pet battles if you don't want to do them, warcrafftpets shows how many people DO like it.<br />
<br />
And as the above poster said, they did seem to be a bit whiny :D If you look at their armouries too, I don't think I saw a single one of them above or close to 2k rating, are there really people 2200+ in 3s and 5s crying about how much better PVE gear is over the PVP 4 sets?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make a spellbook for all the vanity items in the game. The items themselves will become use to learn that spell then you can pull out that spell out of a new tab in the spellbook and activate any vanity effect. It doesn't solve the issue of trinkets with cool vanity effects for sure, but it would eliminate the bulk of the items I have in bank/void storage and let me choose from all the fun effects I have available without forcing me to use up a couple of bags for fun items.</div></div><hr />

Pet Battles are a large part of the game now like it or not! Many players doing them. The game is not just for you, LOTS lots of other players are playing it and have other taste, just be happy Blizzard added in other things to do at max level! Even if you not like it!</div></div><hr />

Every single one of those blue posts makes me want to spit in your face.<br />
You're continuously dumping PvP farther and farther down the toilet, and you refuse to admit it.<br />
<br />
I like how you think you're addressing the Blues directly. They've already answered your shortsighted PvP stats question in the several blogposts and interviews. You just don't like it and so decide that it must be wrong.<br />

<br />
It is ironic no? it is like raiding. The people on the forums crying about how LFR ruins raiding and all the stuff about prestige are usually people who are not in heroics yet. Good pvpers win without a big gear advantage and anyone with half a brain knows that even with the nerfs, pvp gear is superior.<br />

As far as pet battles. I love collecting and leveling, and even the low level pvp battles.<br />
<br />
But to me, pvp battles at 25 are a waste of time. You get nothing from them, and more than likely you are going to run into people using annoying techniques to make a 2 minute game turn into 45 minutes in hopes that you quit. I would greatly prefer that all the achievements and rewards they have for pvp battles at 25 were just changed to pvp battles overall, so you could level pets while doing them and battle against people who don´t have such teams put together just to annoy you into quitting.</div></div><hr />

Adding more space to put more stuff isn't a solution, it's just delaying the problem, and usually not by much. We've been talking about (and even telling all y'all) that solving the storage problem is something we've set our sights on. Of course I'm not going to make an announcement here so no specifics to share yet, or when that relief may surface, but it is something we want to tackle asap.<br />
<br />
Yeah, you have been saying that for YEARS...soon I will have to quit playing my main, simply because I'm running out of space, it's gotten so bad I'll soon won't be able to carry flasks with me...</div></div><hr />

We will probably have another reskinned drake with big horns in 3 different color palets for killing Heroic Garrosh again.<br />

Yup. Similar to what DCUO did with their items. A personal database of every single piece of gear worn by the character - stored in its own &quot;wardrobe&quot; as a statless icon. Just click and voila! Transmog Express.</div></div><hr />

Seems like you're all sad that you're now unable to outshine someone without any resillience in full pvegear in bg:s anymore. That's compleatly a learn to play issue.<br />

The only source for whine I could see that would be legit is that the pvp gear is useless if some randompvphero wanted to do pve - making pvp:ers grind two sets.

Do you pvp? No? your comments then are invalid. I work hard as or even harder for my gear as any pve'er I don't enjoy the RNG or the loot drama of pve. You want to deal with RNG that's your game don't put your pve in my pvp game.<br />

10 straight weeks of capping conquest only to learn that it was meaningless? This after was after removing the rating requirements altogether?<br />
