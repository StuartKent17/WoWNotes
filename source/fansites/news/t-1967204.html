Overwatch - Recall<br />
Overwatch's first animation short has been released! <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/I3WhdXPaUd8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
&quot;Recall&quot; tells the story of Winston—a genetically engineered gorilla and brilliant scientist who longs for the days of heroism to return. In this episode, we explore Winston's thoughts and memories as he wrestles with the decision to recall the agents of Overwatch, all while the forces of Talon stage an attack on his laboratory in the abandoned Watchpoint: Gibraltar. <br />

On your own then. Not sure how the OP effects you, it's not like they had to pull back on WoW news to prioritize on this.<br />

It seemed like the dudes were just standing around when Winston first dropped on them. And doing the 'flashback quote' of the guy who said the thing like ten seconds prior was a bit silly. :p<br />

Overall though, I liked it! It looked fantastic and it's always good to see more story behind this world.<br />

Shorts and a full animated series are not the same thing.<br />
<br />
Activision Blizzard Studios is currently developing a CGI television series based on Skylanders that's set to debut sometime this summer.<br />

<br />
It's great idea, but I don't think animation technology is up to making a series at this level of quality in a timely fashion, yet. So a series wouldn't be of this quality animation - and it's the quality of the animation that gives it half it's charm.</div></div><hr />

Plenty of heroes are the people that do illegal stuff when the people making laws aren't right or fair.<br />
<br />
Of course, history is written by the victors and when things go wrong, those heroes become criminals. Which they are, technically.<br />
<br />
In any case, it's a videogame set in the future with talking gorillas and robot monks, don't overthink it too much.</div></div><hr />

An animation like this we saw probably took around 6 months to make. Maybe even more. It's not feasible to make a weekly 20-30 minute show like that. <br />

First off mmo champion has always been a Warcraft fansite and they do occasionally post news from other mmos but it is first and foremost a Warcraft/blizzard fansite. Also the name could be read as &quot;the champion of mmos&quot; which would most likely be WoW.</div></div><hr />

Guess you were not aware of that, huh? You know the reason why? Because it will make Blizzard look bad that a game that has been released 2 months ago in North America has an expansion coming out in 2 days and its free. Now if a game is cancelled this site has no problem in posting that at all. Just change the sites name already.<br />
<br />
In cases you weren't aware, Blade &amp; Soul was released on June 30, 2012 in other territories. Which is why content is getting faster to you the US consumer. I should rephrase that, in other words you are getting content which has been released a couple of years ago.</div></div><hr />

So what's your point here, what is your goal my man.<br />
You are starting threads in WoW's general discussion about &quot;Blade In Soul&quot; as you call it, in protest of MMO-C being about predominately WoW and Blizzard content. Do you think they are going to change the name because you don't like it? Why don't you head over to the suggestion forums? You are just throwing a little fit at this point my main dude, you should really think positively. Instead of complaining, phrase your frustrations in a positive way my amigo.</div></div><hr />

I know, the emote is very short, but just listening to the tone it made him sound like someone with the ability to not speak well or that of a complete idiot just to have a short show how smart he really is and that he clearly has a well spoken vocabulary. <br />
Is this a big issue? No, just feel the short went one way with him and the game goes another is all.</div></div><hr />

Content was made waaay before the game launched in NA. That's why its coming so quick. Furthermore, an expansion after 2 months, why? Surely after 2 months it would be fairer to say its just adding content they already had lined up? Because the game has existed for 3 years prior to now. All they need to do is translate. They're not building that stuff from scratch.<br />
<br />

Didn't realise fun animations needed a point. But the point of it was showing that Overwatch had been outlawed and that there were still bad guys around, So Winston decided that how the world was wasn't acceptable and that they need heroes back again.<br />

Was a great animation, I look forward to more.</div></div><hr />

It's been an unofficial Blizzard fansite for a long time now. They do post news from relevant MMOs though from time to time. There was a lot of news about Wildstar and Star Wars: The Old Republic when they were in development, pre-release, and at launch. They both died horrible deaths and faded into obscurity. <br />
<br />
Seriously though, Blade &amp; Soul? I loved the game at launch because it had a great combo system, but you're talking about an already niche game (for the West at least) that NCSoft killed through terrible servers in a PvP oriented game and horrible greed. You want to know why MMO-C doesn't talk about it? It was barely relevant when it launched. Now it's even worse. Also, the reason that BnS can release an expansion so quickly is because they only had to localize the expansion which was already released in Korea and given the quality of the localization in the base game I'm surprised it even took them this long.<br />
<br />
There is not some huge MMO-C conspiracy. MMO-C has already been MMO site that is heavily biased towards Blizzard products. However, they're not scared of BnS shedding a bad light on WoW. That's just laughable.</div></div><hr />

Has Megathreads and sub forums for many mmos (FF14, Wildstar, SWTOR to name a few) and this has always been an unofficial Blizzard fansite so your argument is moot. Also if I get it over Battleborn I will be getting it for pc maybe ps4 not sure yet. Tbh might just get Battleborn and Overwatch since they both look good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, as others have already said, Blizzard needs to make an animated series for one of their games. Overwatch seems like a perfect candidate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, but I think it's a bit too serious. &quot;See the world for what it could be&quot; etc...<br />
I would have prefered something that says more &quot;let's get ready for action and have FUN!&quot;...the stuff you usually have in beat 'em ups like Streetfighter, Tekken or the invitation to the tournament of Dead or Alive(the movie). This here felt a bit slow for a game that has no message beside &quot;kill the other team&quot;. I don't know if anyone that is not already hyped will say &quot;I want to play this NOW! GIMME! GIMME!&quot; after watching this trailer...<br />
<br />
Pretty much looks like Overwatch will be the shooter version of LoL or Heroes tho, with all these chars(they basicly announced 15 additional ones alone for Watch there) incomming in the future.</div></div><hr />

Usually when it's attached to a video game I expect to see some kind of general idea of the game. Little to none of that was present in that saturday morning version.

It's because they are giving the game story and depth. If they only made videos of what the characters do in the game (which there are already 100's off both official and not) people would get bored of it.<br />

Sorry but thats not a complaint just to complain. Sell me into a FPS because the story wont be jack shit come play time.<br />

Hell, the little bit of his barrier projector made it look like something of a joke. Let me see some shadow step and death blossom because wraith form doesn't really show much of anything in said cartoon.<br />
<br />
This game will come down to game play. Story is a far distant requirement nor does it give it any more depth in a FPS. Tell their story if they think they must but really highlight what the toons can do in that story because at the end of the day and when it come play time, that story wont mean shit. It will be kill or be killed and thats where the fun will come form. Story long forgotten.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but... a genetically engineered scientist gorilla? Really? Did they hire an 11 year old to write for them?<br />
<br />
Which is a trope that has been around for a long time. Honestly most of Overwatch's characters are established tropes. Not that that's a bad thing necessarily but if you don't like that trope that you should blame Marvel for creating Beast or someone else.</div></div><hr />

Well, apparently that 11 year old applied and got hired, while you did not. Whassup? Jelly? Can do better - put your shit up for vote.<br />
<br />
Yeah, we are all cool and snarky and judgemental and we all have a better story and a better way to tell it, but with all the platforms that the internet offers us, we juuuust never seem to be able to do it. So we are bitter and shit on it all...or downvote it.<br />
<br />
Meh..there certainly is a lot of less watchable stuff out there than this little clip. Kinda cool. What worried me was more like &quot;Why do we get a nice long clip like that for Overwatch and not for Legion?&quot;</div></div><hr />

It's the way they are telling the story in Overwatch. It's an FPS with no campaign so there's no other way to tell the narrative really. WoW's narrative can be told in game.</div></div><hr />

Ahhh..too bad. I would have loved Overwatch to be a single and multi-player game. And get the story told in-game. Soooo...it is all multi player Co-op...team vs team, right? No solo story?</div></div><hr />

I believe it is only PvP. There's no Co Op shit either. But yeah no solo story.</div></div><hr />

SNIP...<br />
<br />
Actually I do and if you had bothered to read just a couple posts above you would have seen my response to the very thing you bring up.<br />
<br />
Sorry but my complaint is very much warranted. At the end of the day, story wont mean jack shit no matter how much blizzard wants to push a Saturday morning cartoon with excellent animations.<br />
<br />
No amount of story will make the sell if the characters are not interesting. IF they must tell some warped story fine. But hell, at least through in some amazing fights where the toons really use their skill from in the game because what little you see in that clip the reaper looked like a chump and that gorilla looked like a fool. Show me some Death blossom and Tesla cannons, not a shield that failed.<br />
<br />

Did you ever play unreal tournament? It too made a poor attempt to have a single player story but that wasn't where the strength of the game was. It was the team battles, capture the flag and, death matches, domination matches, vehicles. All the group stuff.<br />
<br />
Imagine that but blizzard wants each character to have some special stuff (they will have to balance around) instead of what weapons you pick up to determine strength.</div></div><hr />

....It was the first fucking video. What superhero show has crazy action in the first episode? You're being completely irrational about this.</div></div><hr />

and I think you're underselling it's potential just to say, oh it had great animations. Seeing as thats the bulk of it's merits when people talk about it.<br />
<br />
What now? We playing tit for tat on opinions for a cartoon that to be honest, I'd wager didn't really do the game any favors.</div></div><hr />

I think you're overselling the potential of an INTRODUCTORY episode. He gets the gang back together in this episode. It wasn't mean to be a huge battle.<br />
<br />
As for doing the game any favors considering they posted it on the Xbox youtube channel I'm sure it reached a bunch of people who didn't know about it before.</div></div><hr />

The entire game is meant to be a huge battle. Again, you're underselling it thinking the story matters in a group shooter. It never does as it's the game play and what you can do that really sells it.<br />
<br />
All that work and the biggest conversation topic was, blizzard does great animation. It was a weak showing.</div></div><hr />

....Okay. Well you see the team that works on the game and the team that works on the animation are different. So them doing this animation takes nothing away from the game.<br />
<br />
Also Blizzard does do great animation. It was a nice little bit of story and I enjoyed it. Honestly you're just bitching to bitch. Your reasons for why you think its bad are nonsensical. They did use some of the abilities that they can use in game and it is an introductory episode which historically are never action packed.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arafal</div><div class="date">2016-03-23, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what was the point of that cartoon?<br />
<br />
to show the story of the game.<br />
especially winstons in this one.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malacrass</div><div class="date">2016-03-23, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The quality of the short is great, but I do have the feeling I'm not the target audience anymore.<br />
<br />
All the successful family movies manage to cater to both young and old, mostly because of clever humor and dialogue, but I can't find it in Overwatch. Of course this won't stop me from trying the game, but it's understandable when people say this is supposed to be a game for kids (or a game for your inner child, as Blizzard puts it....)</div></div><hr />

Well it's clear there is no way in hell we're going to agree other than yea, its good animation. While I know it's different teams, they are working to present the game and hook people. That clip didn't do it for me. It sure as hell didn't make me think, man I should pre-order that.</div></div><hr />
