It took a little over five years (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/236761-appear-offline-option-coming-soon-to-battlenet/), but Soon™ has finally arrived! Appear Offline is being tested now.<br />
Introducing new social features now available in the beta version of the Blizzard Battle.net® desktop app: the new Social tab, Blizzard Groups, profiles, avatars, and the ability to appear offline! To help get these into as many players’ hands as possible, starting today the beta version of the app is open to you and your friends—no invitation required.<br />
<br />
To switch to the beta version of the Blizzard Battle.net app, simply open your app settings, click on the Beta tab, and then click Switch to Beta Version.<br />
<br />
These features are designed to give Blizzard players even more ways to stay connected, and we’re looking forward to continuing to evolve the app and build even more ways for you to stay in touch and join forces for your next adventure.<br />
<br />
Social Tab<br />
Our new Social tab is your one-stop-shop for managing all your various social interactions. Whether you’re chatting with a friend or engaged in our new Blizzard Groups, you’ll easily be able to pick up where you left off in all of your conversations.<br />
<br />
Blizzard Groups<br />
Blizzard Groups are a new way for you to connect with your friends and plan your next mission. Players can create and join Groups based on their common interests. There, they can keep in touch, share strategies, and catch up on conversations they might have missed while offline.<br />
<br />
Each Group can have multiple text and voice chat channels, and Group administrators have a variety of tools to help manage membership, send out invitation links, and more.<br />
<br />
The Groups beta is available now in the Americas region. Head to the new Social tab to get the party started!<br />
<br />

<br />
Profiles<br />
Let the Blizzard world know a little bit more about you by customizing your profile!<br />
<br />
Your profile will allow you to select an avatar, share what’s on your mind with an About message, add links to where people can find you on social media, and more! You can also view profiles of other players if you’re curious about a pending friend request or what games a friend plays.<br />
<br />
Players using the beta in the Americas region can customize their profile through the View Profile button in the app header and Friends List drop-downs.<br />
<br />

<br />
Appear Offline<br />
Appear offline allows you to set your status to show you as “offline” to your Blizzard friends while remaining connected to Battle.net. This means you can launch the app and game away without distraction.<br />
<br />
Appearing offline will show you as offline to everyone in your Blizzard friends list. Once you have joined a game, the experience of appearing offline might be slightly different depending on which game you are playing. In the case of World of Warcraft, your guildmates will see your character come online and enter WoW’s in-game chat channels, and anyone who has you as a character-level friend will see you online on their friends list. Everyone outside of the same game as you will not see you online or playing any games.<br />
<br />
Do you see a friend who’s offline but you really want to send them a message while it’s on your mind? You can now send offline friends messages and they will receive them the next time they come online! While appearing offline you can still send and receive messages in the app, but it is up to you when you want to respond.<br />
<br />
We know a lot of you have been looking forward to big updates like this, and we’re excited to roll them out and get your feedback (https://us.battle.net/forums/en/bnet/9772478?utm_source=desktopweb-news&amp;utm_campaign=web-us-desktopwebnews&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_content=21098852).

Not new as such but they were first with combining IRC and Teamspeak in to a successful platform as far as I know. And this by the looks of it is nothing but a pale (blue) copy of Discord for Blizzard games only. Which kinda makes it redundant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said it would happen, but likely not this expac. That was during BlizzCon last year, I think. I would assume this came first because it applies to all of their games. I would imagine there's also the possibility this will somehow work with existing social systems in WoW once they're updated at some point, maybe next expansion or in one of the couple promised minor patches before this xpac ends. Maybe seeing cross-server guild options or multi-guilding or something.<br />
<br />
In-game social UI also needs to be updated to allow us to on-click voice chat from the friends list without having to minimize for the battle.net ui.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
No thanks. Don't care for Blizzard reading all my chats outside of their games.<br />
<br />
Offline mode is all I want from this.<br />
<br />
So, all of the other companies hosting your chat services, texts, etc., are all somehow better and don't fit into your conspiracy theory that Blizzard employees are personally reading your chat history out of millions of players globally since they have no other work to do? Huh. Neat.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, but I have a feeling since they actually took the step to implement it into b.net, they'll eventually fully implement it into WoW too. It would make sense, they're way behind in adding that feature anyway.</div></div><hr />

I find it great so many are attacking the offline feature and praising discord... do you all not realize &quot;Invisible&quot; is an option in discord? It is actually called Invisible too. Except if you've connected to things like steam or bnet it doesn't work as it says &quot;Offline&quot; but playing World of Warcraft lol</div></div><hr />

Being offline is supposed to be an option for those who want to login during the day without being noticed. Maybe because they're not in the mood, because they're in a hurry or any other personal reason. Who cares if &quot;everyone else&quot; can't see you... nobody ever cared about me outside guildmates and friends so they will still don't care. There is no logical reason to be &quot;offline&quot; for unknown players...</div></div><hr />

Let's make a function where you can appear offline, so that you can become a loner! Already a sick amount of low pop realms out there, and while people may theoreticaly still will be online, I predict this will backfire some how.<br />

Guildmates and players who added your toon to their friends list will always see you.

So you can actually play WoW without people bothering you to join them in OW/D3/SC2/HS/HotS/D2?<br />

- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Apart from Warlords of Draenor, this appear offline function is the biggest mistake in the company's history.<br />
Let's make a function where you can appear offline, so that you can become a loner! Already a sick amount of low pop realms out there, and while people may theoreticaly still will be online, I predict this will backfire some how.<br />
If you don't want to socialize in an MMORPG then, you are playing the wrong game.<br />
<br />
Battle.net is not about WoW only anymore.<br />
<br />
If someone doesn't want to play WoW (or any other blizzard/activision games) at that time and instead play another one of said games, they can play without having to answer every single whisper asking them to leave their current game to join them on the other.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
They can still see you joining/queuing in the &quot;Quick Join&quot; menu...<br />
<br />
Yes, but then you're playing WoW in that specific character. People playing OW/D3/HotS/HS/D2 (or guilds from other characters in WoW) won't be bothering you if you don't want it.<br />
<br />
It's so simple.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Guildmates and players who added your toon to their friends list will always see you. WoW players asked for a true &quot;invisible&quot; mode for years and Blizzard gave them a tool that will make them invisible to... unknown people only (who never cared about you anyway). On the other side the invisible mode works as intended for Overwatch, HOTS, Heartstone... Everything except WoW.<br />
<br />
It's actually working as intended for all games.<br />
<br />
It's about Battle.net plataform, not WoW only. People from your Diablo 3 clan will see you online in Diablo 3, will see you receiving legendaries and achievements, all that.<br />
<br />
Talking about WoW only, unlike D3, your account is not linked to a guild, so you can have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... as many guilds as you want (and have characters for it), so you don't exactly stay online for every single guild you're part of anyway.<br />
<br />
But for the plataform where this really is planned for, battle.net, is working as intended.</div></div><hr />

well if you need to be invisible to realID people you have other serious problems.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
But then again back in AIM days, we would often make ourselves 'invisible' so people wont see us online.but thats wasnt a MMO....<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed, but I have a feeling since they actually took the step to implement it into b.net, they'll eventually fully implement it into WoW too.It is implemented in wow. there will never be any other way than it is right now in wow because for example you cant be in a guild, online in that guild and NOT apear on that roster.... and I doubt after 14 years of spagethi code they can rewrite that.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
So you can actually play WoW without people bothering you to join them in OW/D3/SC2/HS/HotS/D2?Just talk to them and tell them you wanna play wow now? after all you put them on your FRIENDS list....</div></div><hr />

When I played Diablo, I refused to accept friend invites, just to stop saying no to everyone, 70% of the time. If I had offline mode, I could say yes close to 100% of the time.

My previous alternatives were close the app out entirely, send out a btag broadcast, or set my status to DND and then wait for the inevitable &quot;Yo Yot, I see you're dnd, everything ok?&quot; <br />

Not personally directed at you, Darth Dracula, and apologies to the poster of the BlizzardWatch comment (but it's such a nice summation):<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;but the endeavor turned out to be far more technically challenging than they expected and it was soon mysteriously dropped.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is the pat stock bullshit answer. They didn't want us having an invisible mode. They used to say as such, especially when pertaining to WoW. &quot;WoW is an MMO, which means you shouldn't be able to hide from people.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't work for Blizzard, but I know enough about how the Battle.net client works that I can tell you straight-up how to implement an offline mode. In fact, players already did it using another method. Some people found out if you blocked the port the client uses for social communication, you appeared to go offline.<br />
<br />
What did Blizzard do? They patched the client and changed the port and made it unblockable. If you block the new one, the entire client disconnects.<br />
<br />
They simply didn't want people to be able to appear offline. Keep that in mind every time they roll out the stock bullshit &quot;technical difficulties&quot; excuse.<br />
<br />
<br />
And before you think the person was &quot;full of it&quot;, like one of the replies over there did, here's an excerpt of the followup:<br />
<br />
<br />
Making shit up? When people first started asking for an appear offline feature, Blizzard kept saying they didn't want one because they didn't want people hiding online. The technical bullshit excuse came later.<br />
<br />
What backseat access do you need to read publicly-available comments on their own forums? If you're referring to my knowledge of how the client works, it's because it's not some mysterious, arcane program that only Blizzard knows the workings of. The client continuously pings everyone on your friends list for a status update. All the client has to do is return a value saying you're in invisible mode. That's it. Suddenly you won't show up on the client to other people anymore.<br />
<br />
As for the port blocking, go Google it. Players found a workaround, and Blizzard stopped it. That clearly demonstrates that it wasn't an impossible hurdle to overcome and it was more about their own opinion.<br />

Things were a lot different back when appearing offline was first announced on September 20, 2012. Diablo III was only about 5 months old, Mists of Pandaria was just about to launch, and Hearthstone, Overwatch, and Heroes of the Storm didn't exist. You also have to remember that the Battle.net app was still in its early stages, with the mandatory push not being until shortly before the launch of the Warlords of Draenor expansion in fall 2014.<br />
<br />
So given all that, you'll have to pardon me if the only thing I care about is getting an ACTUAL appear offline for WoW.</div></div><hr />

What that guy said though applies to the Battle.net Service. You can appear offline on Battle.net yet still show up to people who have your characters name added on WoW. I've often been disconnected from Battle.net whilst in WoW and I lose access to my Battle.net Friends list and show up as offline to them yet still show online if they add my character to Friends list INGAME.<br />
<br />
Hence why I see them as too different types of Lists and why it seems the default friends list in WoW was never updated when they added the B.net friends layer over top of it, and why it seems like it it could be a limitation thing. Since the in-game friend function has NO connection to Battle.net launcher thus would not include the Battle.net coding that makes appear Offline possible as it predates it by half a decade whereas all other Blizzard games have launched with the Battle.net App coded into them.</div></div><hr />

Not a single MMO behave like that. Just don't play MMOs if you're socially akward. Like we don't give a fuck you're so special you deserve a super special mode to be super secretly connected but nobody should know in a massively open world game.</div></div><hr />

I'd be willing to bet in the case of most people it has minimal impact. Steam has an invisible mode, most chat clients have an invisible mode, if this one doesn't do everything you think it should it's still more than we had a week ago.

So people who take &quot;sick days&quot; when a new game or expansion launches must just be honest with their boss? &quot;Listen boss, I am going to fake not feeling well so I can take some time off to play my favourite game. Thanks!&quot; I am sure that will go down well.<br />
<br />
That is one of the many valid reasons why people wanted an appear offline feature. Their co-workers or boss might be into Diablo or Hearthstone and not WoW. But now they can't take &quot;sick days&quot; to play the game because their peers will see them online. Especially now with the new Blizzard app anyone can see what their friends are doing and even message them outside of games, from their phones! <br />
<br />
That is just one reason. I can list plenty more. It is not always just a case of people not being able to say no to their online friends.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who supports that level of stupidity is just moronic.

This is a battle.net feature. You appear offline to your battle.net friends. The main reason for this to exist is to appear offline to anyone you've added to battletag. The feature works. To quote the title of the article &quot;New Social Features Now in Beta in the Blizzard Battle.net Desktop App.&quot; This wasn't listed as appear offline to your in-game friends or be completely invisible to everyone around you in an mmo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is not about being anti social, sometimes you want to dodge out on shitty plans or play when you are sick and don't want people to know. I do not see how that should be an issue. I stopped using social media because of this reason too, no one needs to know what I am doing unless they contact me directly.</div></div><hr />

....angry much? I have raided every tier as current since game launch ,even messing with some mythic stuff. I'm not socially &quot;awkward&quot; and have tons of online friends , not just in Wow. I still believe they are missing the point of &quot;appear offline &quot; mode. The way they are adding is not only not what it truly means but even still its being implemented in a way that most don't want or understand the point of as many of these posts show.

Perhaps Blizzard shouldn't pat them selves on the back as much for making an offline feature that doesn't meet the actual needs of the community from such a feature then...just because people want to ability to play the game without being online for everyone to know doesn't mean they are asocial in general.<br />
<br />
<br />
(I mostly like I can finally stop having to get the newest VOIP program and just use the battle.net app that I have open anyways)<br />

Yeah because software like Teamspeak or Discord won't still be far superior to Blizzards pale copy. I mean you can keep hoping that won't be the case but I don't see the usefulness unless you and all your friends exclusively play Blizzard games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Battle.net was &quot;never just WoW&quot; in the first place. We had Diablo, Warcraft 2, Starcraft/Brood War, Warcraft 3 and Diablo 2 all using Battle.net before WoW even happened.<br />
<br />
WoW didn't even support Battle.net until 2009 when it was integrated into it and eventually all accounts were automatically forced onto Battle.net 2.0. Which was good because we then got Real ID which means we could chat to our friends on different servers/games. But before that WoW accounts and management were completely separate from Battle.net.<br />
<br />
Before that Battle.net was a matchmaking system and lobby for Diablo, Starcraft and Warcraft.<br />
<br />
And this feature has literally zero downsides at all. I won't be using it personally but well if my friends want some time to themselves then they can. And if they want to chat they know I will be about.</div></div><hr />

You probably weren't even born when UO came out but there was no way of seeing who was online or offline in that game, still isn't, unless they wander on to your screen. It was the first &quot;mainstream&quot; mmo and still has a sub fee and active playerbase 20 years later.<br />

Wow, that brain of yours is truly something. It's almost like... if you want to appear offline, you don't want to do group shit, especially with people you know and instead just want to chill out on your own doing whatever the fuck it is you want to do without being bombarded with group requests or even just conversation.<br />

Because it's not your fucking business to dictate what other people do with their time or money. And some people don't want to spend every waking moment in the game doing group shit. Not that it matters, because as previously stated, it's none of your fucking business.<br />

Rofl, because if they log off due to &quot;not feeling like raiding&quot; they aren't going to be doing any raiding with us again ever, not hiding behind something that doesn't exist in any other MMO except GW2 as far as I know, and GW2 doesn't really count for much.</div></div><hr />

Yes it does matter, if they're going to slight 19 other people because they don't feel like doing something Blizzard doesn't need to be giving them the means to hide from the guild.<br />
<br />
And who shit in your cheerios this morning, you're the only one even slightly angry here, I honestly don't care, just pointing out counter arguments.<br />
<br />
Here's another couple:<br />
<br />
1.) Harder to report botters if you have to physically see the, reported a couple of people who were online in guild 24/7, obviously botting. (They ended up on &quot;vacation&quot;)<br />
<br />
2.) Couple of times people have caught other peoples accounts being hacked through friends lists/guilds lists, and notified that person long before they would have found out themselves.<br />
<br />
bnet friends list is one thing, in game is another</div></div><hr />

No, it doesn't fucking matter. If you're going to kick someone for saying they don't feel like raiding on a given night (or just don't show up), it doesn't matter one fucking bit if they say it then log off, never show up, or log in and go invisible. It's all the same thing in your idiotic scenario.<br />
<br />
Again: Do you have any ability to actually think critically? Not that an answer is actually required when the proof is in the pudding of your last few replies.<br />
<br />
1.) Harder to report botters if you have to physically see the, reported a couple of people who were online in guild 24/7, obviously botting. (They ended up on &quot;vacation&quot;)<br />
BZZT, you can report people just fine. They're not physically invisible, you nonce.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.) Couple of times people have caught other peoples accounts being hacked through friends lists/guilds lists, and notified that person long before they would have found out themselves.<br />
Oh no, not a &quot;couple of times!&quot; Let's blow away anything that might help that! Blizzard should be posting IP numbers, phone numbers, mailing addresses, and everything else they can just to make sure someone can't do that, and should they do that, you can contact them immediately in this once-in-a-blue-moon scenario that shouldn't be occurring at all anymore unless someone idiotically doesn't have a key! HERP A DERP! U R GEENUS 4 SHORE!!! THIS IS A 4SRS THREAT FOR REALSIES Y'ALL!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
bnet friends list is one thing, in game is another <br />
No. It really fucking isn't. Or does your idiocy on the subject extend to this logic: &quot;Oh, if they're around on Battle.Net but not in the game, it's cool if they blow our guild event off even though they're clearly online. BUT GOD FUCKING HELP THEM if they log into the game itself!!! HOLY SHIT, they are SO out if they do that!!! So what if they can't raid for any of dozens of different reasons, but have some spare time to fool around online for a bit? That doesn't matter! IF THEY LOG IN, THEY'RE DEAD TO ME! BECAUSE THAT'S HOW A GOOD GUILD WORKS!&quot;<br />
<br />
That whole line of thought is just so fucking stupid it defies description.</div></div><hr />

Neither is Battle.net client, which is exactly where folks asking for appear offline wanted it.<br />

With this mode the WoW game's friends lists are exactly where they were at before Battle.net was a thing. Was anyone crying &quot;antisocial!&quot; back then?</div></div><hr />

Wow is the most &quot;solo friendly&quot; mmo I can think of, I can do whatever I want in that game, including things that require groups, within a couple of clicks. I don't see any reason to have to broadcast my status to a bunch of people playing overwatch...</div></div><hr />

<br />
just like RL, I have a lot of awesome friends, that doesn't mean I should be available to them 24 hours a day. Or in the online world, every second I'm online. Sometimes a person wants some alone time,which is perfectly normal. And even though Wow is an mmo...I shouldn't be able to play it for a bit alone and truly unable to be disturbed? because its an mmo? wanting alone time means I have to play a single player game? why so? where is this law? People should have options, if the feature isn't for you then don't use it and let the ones who may do, no explanations really needed. It's sort of like the flying debate.</div></div><hr />
