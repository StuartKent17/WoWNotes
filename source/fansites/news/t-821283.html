Addon Spotlight - Archy (by Simca (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/545200-Simca))<br />
While Archaeology is a relatively new profession, there are already several very promising addons out there. Perhaps the most interesting and functional of them is Archy - Archaeological Assistant (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/archy.aspx), commonly referred to as 'Archy'. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Archy - Archaeological Assistant on Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/archy.aspx)<br />
<br />
<br />
Archy's general purpose is to make everything in Archaeology easier to use. It has a display (regular or LDB) which will show you what you are working on for all nine cultures and which you are able to solve (with and without keystones). It will also show you which dig sites you have active on every continent, and for what culture every dig site is for!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2010/december/archy1_small.png (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2010/december/archy1.png) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2010/december/archy2_small.png (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2010/december/archy2.png) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2010/december/archy3_small.png (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2010/december/archy3.png)<br />
<br />
While the other features of Archy are useful and help to set it apart from others of its kind, the most important part of Archy is arguably its node database (or more precisely, the ability to collect nodes and make a node database). At first glance, Archaeology nodes may appear to be random within the dig sites, but in reality, they are static. It is completely random which nodes you will get, but each node still has a set location. Knowing this, and realizing that there is a large variance on the survey tool at a &quot;red&quot; distance (up to around 90 degrees in either direction), you can quickly figure out where nodes are located based on only one or two surveys for small to medium dig sites. Archy capitalizes on this by collecting all of the node data into a database; after you loot fragments, Archy will mark the spot you looted them from on your map.<br />
<br />
Additionally, Archy provides a color indicator for users new to Archaeology, or ones who like guidelines. It appears by default (but can be easily disabled, if you wish) when you cast survey, and as you move towards the next position, it will track your distance from the last marker. For example, if your survey's color is yellow, an indicator icon will pop up with a number of yards (measuring the distance between you and the previous survey) and the current color. As you move forward, the number of yards will increase, the the color will eventually change to yellow. Since your color is yellow, you can stop at that point and survey again. When you combine this with the node database, finding fragments becomes easy! Do be warned that unlike the node database, this system is not always accurate. Some dig sites seem to have more difficult &quot;color rules&quot; than others, and it will take the author a while to account for all of the different rules for each site.<br />
<br />

<br />
Archy also features TomTom (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/tomtom.aspx) integration. When you finish your current dig site, it will send the coordinates of the next dig site to TomTom. When you arrive at the site, you can even have Archy play a sound to indicate your arrival. This is very helpful if you enable the &quot;Sound in Background&quot; option in the Sound options of World of Warcraft and then alt-tab while you are flying. You can then go faster than flight paths, since you are traveling in a straight line, and be notified when you arrive so can catch yourself from going too far.<br />

The Daily Blink - Mysterious Fortune Card<br />
There was an interesting update on the The Daily Blink (http://www.thedailyblink.com/2010/12/this-warning-now-required-by-law/) a few days ago. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2010/december/dailyblink6.jpg (http://www.thedailyblink.com/2010/12/this-warning-now-required-by-law/)<br />
<br />
If you do not catch the reference, it means you never heard of the Mysterious Fortune Card (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86609) in-game! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mysterious Fortune Card (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86609) - 1 x Resilient Parchment (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/39502), 1 x Blackfallow Ink (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/61978). <br />
<br />
<br />
This card is very easy to craft and doesn't create any useful item. So ... what's the point? Gambling! When used, your newly created Mysterious Fortune Card (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86609) will have a chance to turn into one of the following items:<br />
<br />
&lt;table class=&quot;news-table&quot; style=&quot;width:600px !important;&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;thead&gt;<br />

<br />
Yes, you're reading that right, by crafting this very very simple item you can get an epic card that you can sell for 5000 gold to any NPC!!. <br />
<br />
Sadly, the chances to actually get that card are incredibly low and your chances to leave the Auction House with more money than when you entered are the same as with any casino. But if you're feeling lucky ... <br />

Thrall: Then and Now<br />
Fortified citadels lay in ruins. Ancient forests burn brightly in the light of the setting sun. Arid stretches of desert, once known to claim even the most hearty of travelers, now house fertile oases teeming with new species of flora.<br />
<br />
The Shattering changed a great many things. While the landscapes of the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor may have been the most visibly affected by Deathwing's return, many of Azeroth's heroes have also undergone drastic physical transformations of their own.<br />
<br />
One of the most notable metamorphoses in Cataclysm is that of Thrall. Thrall He's worn many titles in his lifetime: slave, gladiator, shaman, chieftain of the Frostwolf Clan, and, most recently, warchief of the Horde. Now, as the son of Durotan puts down the mantle of warchief and takes up the simple garb of a shaman once again, we take a look back at his journey and the events that shaped him into the orc he is today.<br />
<br />
The orcish Horde was once a demonic weapon of indiscriminate slaughter -- a far departure from the orcs' proud and shamanic origins. Thrall's rise to become Horde warchief, however, changed everything. After escaping from his enslavement by the human Aedelas Blackmoore, Thrall helped rally the remnants of the Horde, revitalized the orcs' shamanic traditions, and established a refuge for his embattled race in the arid land of Durotar. In the years that followed, the image of Warchief Thrall bearing the legendary warhammer and battle-worn black armor of the late Orgrim Doomhammer was etched in the minds of friends and foes alike. All that the Horde had become -- its courage, its strength, and its honor -- Thrall embodied.<br />
<br />
When Azeroth's elemental spirits grew increasingly erratic just prior to the Shattering, Thrall was torn between his worldly responsibilities as warchief and his spiritual duties as a shaman. Ultimately, he followed his instincts and entrusted control over the Horde -- and everything he had labored to build -- to Garrosh Hellscream. Thrall also shed the armor that had come to symbolize him as warchief and donned the simplistic robes and prayer beads of a shaman. While Garrosh has made questionable changes to the Horde in recent times, Thrall remains focused on allaying the forces that threaten to tear Azeroth itself apart. Some members of the Horde might want him as their warchief, but the world needs him as a shaman above all else.<br />
<br />
We'll be examining other key characters' transformations -- including those of Garrosh, Anduin Wrynn, and Magni Bronzebeard -- in the months ahead, so come back soon.<br />

Microsoft Kinect with World of Warcraft<br />
An interesting video surfaced on Slashdot (http://games.slashdot.org/story/10/12/28/0928236/Microsoft-Kinect-With-emWorld-of-Warcraftem?from=rss) today, of course it's just a technological demo but it's always fun to see the cool things people manage to do with WoW.<br />
<br />
Researchers at the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies have developed software that enables control of PC video games using the Microsoft Kinect sensor. Their toolkit, known as the Flexible Action and Articulated Skeleton Toolkit (FAAST) (http://people.ict.usc.edu/~suma/faast/), emulates custom-configured keyboard controls triggered by body posture and specific gestures. This video shows a user playing the online game World of Warcraft using the Kinect. Potential applications of this technology include video games for motor rehabilitation after stroke and reducing childhood obesity through healthy gaming.&quot;<br />

Heroic Dungeons Difficulty<br />
Players were conditioned at the end of Wrath of the Lich King to mow through Heroics at lightning speed. Not only were they too easy to begin with, by the time Dungeon Finder came out players greatly out-geared the majority of these dungeons.<br />
<br />
The reality is that it makes sense for Heroics to be a true and necessary stepping stone into raiding. They are more difficult at the beginning of this expansion's lifespan than they were at the beginning of Lich King. We like it that way. We want you thinking and trying new approaches through trial and error in order to succeed, just as groups do while raiding.<br />
<br />
As new tiers of gear are released and new raids open up, Heroics will naturally become easier, but that provides little good reason for trivializing them now. This is true even if some groups -- particularly pick-up groups -- lack the patience, will, or teamwork necessary to succeed.<br />
<br />
We prefer that skill and character power provide the edge in Heroic dungeons, rather than supplying simple boss fights where mistakes are so easily forgivable.<br />
<br />
Will it test you to play at your best and communicate effectively with your group? Certainly. Should Heroic dungeons be tuned down so failure is rarely a real possibility? That doesn't sound like interesting design to me, nor would it act as a good catalyst for compelling, strategic, and social gameplay. <br />
<br />
[...] You might have to spend more time in normal dungeons than you did before if you want a very relaxing dungeon experience right now, before you jump into Heroics determined to succeed with ease. The difficulty of this expansion is on a different level right now, but it's still nowhere near the gap between five-player dungeons and raiding which existed in the original release, and to a lesser extent The Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
If you expect a quick, mellow run through Heroic dungeons -- which provide quite powerful gear given we're on the first Cataclysm raid tier -- this early in the entire lifespan of this expansion, you might want to consider collecting items and gear via normal dungeons and other means before regularly hopping into the Heroic queue. They're not super-unfriendly toward casual players, but they do require casual players to exercise skill and proper social/leadership skills. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/147081/cancel-your-account))<br />
<br />
Daze / Dismount<br />
Granted, there are plenty of creatures out there that provide a completely trivial challenge for your character in terms of power/level which can daze you. Even still, knowing how to path around hostile creatures (or now fly over them) seems like it should be somewhat meaningful. It's not that hard to avoid being hit by creatures while mounted, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't have to care at all about where you're going.<br />
<br />
Regardless of level, the world should still feel alive and present some sort of threat, even if that threats merely involves slowing you down en route to your destination. <br />
<br />
[...] I don't really follow the logic that you feel it's unnecessary that you can't just gather as many mobs on you as possible in an area with no threat of being knocked off your mount, or slowed down while running. Should it really be considered an inconvenience that a bunch of mobs striking you can do nothing to slow you down? It seems like you could then apply the term &quot;inconvenience&quot; to a lot of aspects of gameplay, but at the end of the day removing those inconveniences would start to dull down the game.

Seriously, I think they read too much hardcore whining over the years and now their brains are malfunctioning. Not sure why they even mentioned casuals, what has being casual to do with skill?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I only completed 3-4 heroics and that's it. I don't think I can do any in the next months seeing as I can't afford to sit 2-3 hours in a row in front of my computer, and I am not even casual but I still got things to do.<br />
<br />
The only way for players to reduce the time spent in heroics would be to always run with a premade of 5 GOOD players that you know. Otherwise they will take forever for at least a year, guild doesn't help when not everyone in it is a great players or doesn't know the instance.<br />
<br />
Boss fight are not consistent anyway, some bosses are brain dead easy and allow plenty mistakes and some are simply overtuned, that when you even look wrong at them you get one shotted.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they are using this definition of the word &quot;casual&quot;<br />
<br />
done or acting without sufficient care or thoroughness<br />

many words have multiple definitions even within one language/region, what they consider casual does not have to be the same as what you consider casual.</div></div><hr />

I dont see the sense in wasting more than a hour on getting the debuff and waiting to queue again where you could have just taken a few minutes at the most to explain fight mechanics to someone who doesn't know them.Most people I have pugged with respond better to giving advice than shouting n00b at them for not knowing how a fight works.Heroics pugs now encourage communication and are not for the anti social or impatiant<br />
I am a casual player and rarely get to play for more than 3 hours continiously and I am happy with where the difficulty is,most wipes come from people not knowing fight mechanics and being slighty undergeared.Wich is to be expected seeing as the expansian is less than a month old.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those people who relied on LFD to simply be carried through dungeons on their way to tier10 are the ones making the biggest fuss. Those people who went afk (sec .. phone) or simply stood in fire during boss fights because the fight would be over before the damage could possibly kill them, are having a tough time. It is those people who wait in the LFD queue for 45 minutes or an hour, only to be kicked from the group, because they ignore mechanics, don't use cc, or simply take too much damage who cry about it being too tough.<br />
<br />
Honestly, my guild groups generally have tank and healer covered so we are looking for a dps or maybe two to fill the group, and the seriously horrible dps that is in the LFD makes me never ever want to heal or tank a random. Why on earth you would wait in a queue for 45 minutes, only to start telling the tank to hurry up, or start pulling stuff on there own is simply beyond my comprehension. We often times will go through 2 or 3 dps in a run before we find someone who is willing to do what they need to do to help the group succeed. and that's not being elitist, i don't recall ever kicking anyone for low dps or mistakenly breaking a CC alone. I think the worst thing we ever kicked someone for was when we got a pair of warriors who obviously where queued together. seriously though, if you are down two dps for a heroic and you get a pair of warriors ... that is sort of a bummer. <br />
<br />
The real issue is that the LFD tool is currently not useful to the masses. In another month it probably will be ... <br />

That particular group was using it to demonstrate what the kinect is capable of and in no way or form were they saying you could play WoW at 100% with it. While I do agree it would never work with WoW outside of very basic gameplay I do feel it has a lot to do with the future of gaming. Imagine a FPS where you play completely with your own body movements, if they could pull it off (which this video proves is definitely possible in the very near future) it would be a huge hit in the gaming world.<br />
<br />
TL;DR Version: Kinect is bad as hell, they never said you could play wow 100% with it. Kinect is the future of gaming.</div></div><hr />

Not only Zarhym obviously bit a troll, he also quite blatantly insulted wide range of players that play WoW casually--meaning they have to prioritize when and for how long they can play, the term does not determine their performance in-game.<br />
<br />
I was great supporter of LFD tool when it was introduced during mid-WOTLK and avid supporter of it for the rest of it. It is with great disappointment to finally admit that Cataclysm killed LFD, at least until time when general public will overgear these instances again. Zarhym said they wanted to make Cataclysm game play challenging and fun. I fully support such statement and determination, however, such intention should not go against previously implemented solutions--e.g. LFD tool. This tool bring to life true meaning of term pick-up group: random people joining random instance with varying levels of game knowledge, gear, experience and time available. Expectation that such group will work at high level of coordination, communication and within performance limits to allow for smooth clearing of challenging content is far too stretched. It can, it sometimes does but more often than not it is not the case.<br />
<br />
I'm currently at verge of completely abandoning any attempts to join LFD with my characters because it just does not work anymore. Introduction of CC requirements, at least in early stages of Cataclysm, and damaging mechanics that are avoidable but deal significant amount of damage if not avoided have pushed &quot;difficulty&quot; of instances far away from what you can reasonably expect from LFD PUGs. I intentionally put difficulty in parenthesis as this is difficulty is artificial. Problem with the difficulty is in fact it works in a binary manner. It is either there, when you do not have CC, or it is not there, when you bring lots of it. LFD tool is not able to ensure you have class composition with viable CC similarly it cant ensure you get competent players. If shit hits the fan, you not only get little or no CC at all but also incompetent players to top it off. Unfortunately, the later situation is what I have been experiencing with LFD for quite some time now.<br />
<br />
At the end, this rant only addresses issues with LFD as Cataclysm content is very enjoyable with friends and guildmates so far.</div></div><hr />

So I guess it isn't so hard as much as it is different from WoTLK? I'm ok with that, I have been around since Vanilla and although my playing time has decreased dramatically, I wouldn't say I'm a bad player. I been through just about every raid/dungeon/heroic in the game pre-cata so I'm ok with it. <br />
<br />
It just feels rather time consuming now tho, and maybe that's just because it's new and different than it was most recently, hopefully that will even out in time tho. I admit, I haven't done much of anything at all in Cata aside from quests, so I can't really comment on actual content... just time in the QUE trying to do a dungeon.. and decent &quot;casual&quot; guilds are incredibly hard to find.</div></div><hr />

You are making a very real mistake here, the same one blizz is making. They are assuming anyone who doesn't run heroics, or spend 6 hours a day playing has no skill. I don't play that much, but I have plenty of skill. The problem with elitist like you is that you think anyone who doesn't play this game like a full time job lacks skill. <br />

About the kinect that was really great. Anything that gets kids off the couch and on their feet is great. America really does have an issue with obesity. Part of that has to do with issues of entertainment, but another issue with it is safety. When someone asks what their kids can do to stay healthy you can't just say let them go play at the park. Crime is a serious issue. Now it's simply safer for children to stay at home. This will give children, and adults, a fun way to exercise. The wii was a great thing for that. Of course the system was lacking in some areas, but with the xbox offering this it's a very good solution. The technology they are using allows it to be applicable to a much wider variety of media. So while people on here may say &quot;hurrr let's see you do heroics with that, lols @u&quot; they are idiots. You should appreciate what this is trying to accomplish. If you can't, then maybe you are part of the problem America is having. I'm not going to call you fat, but maybe you have some other reason for not encouraging a way to have fun and exercise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no, it is you making the mistake. progression for end game content: normal dungeons -&gt; heroic dungeons -&gt; raids -&gt; heroic raids <br />
<br />
The LFD queues are long because people cannot and/or do not want to carry bad players through heroics. now this doesn't mean you are bad, you could be the best player in the friggin world, but for every one of you, there are 50 players who are not up to snuff for heroics and think they are entitled to be carried .. .while they eat, or talk on the phone, or go shower ...<br />
<br />
this is the reality three weeks after release: a competent group, minimally geared (ilvl329) and learning fights you are looking at 2 hours for a heroic. a competent group geared decently (ilvl340) who know the fights, you are looking at 45 minutes (depending on which dungeon,some are longer).<br />
<br />
if you cant spend the two hours progressing towards the 45 min runs, then level archaeology until the masses over gear the current heroics, lfd queues are 15 minutes again for dps, and its a chain pull fest. i give it 3 months tops.</div></div><hr />

Hrm...well lets examine this shall we? We're three weeks in, so that means you could have only done BH 3 times, whats the easiest way to gain rep? oh right heroics! , how many people have the money to pay some of the rediculous prices for the BoEs? escpecially casuals? and crafted pieces that are worth anything require the new orbs which are BoP and come from where? the end of a heroic! So supporting the idea that casuals can easily obtain gear outside of heroics is rediculous.<br />
<br />
I lawl at your &quot;L2Tank or Heal&quot;, so if the queue is full of tanks and healers, who is going to DPS? And I don't know if you noticed, but neither tanking or healing are cake walks anymore, so they require as much if not more skill than DPSing.<br />
<br />
And really? calling pure DPS classes lazy cause they have to wait in LFD queues? Some people don't have guilds, some guilds don't do guild heroics, most people will not run with a scheduled cross-guild group.<br />
<br />
Failtards? really? I complain not at the fact that these things are hard so much as they are too hard for the majority of the player base, I play 6+ hours a day, I have no life, I'm the definition of hardcore, I know how to play my toons, in whatever role they're in. However, most people have lives, and cannot dedicate the same time that others do to this game, now does that mean they are automatically less skilled than hardcore? not necessarily. What it does imply though is that as they don't dedicate much time per day/week to playing they don't want to wait an hour in a queue just to fail or sit in a heroic for 2+ hours, so they don't queue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you were at work doing whatever it is you do and the floor beneath you caught on fire or you saw a giant monster running towards you, wouldn't you move? So why wouldn't you move your character in a game when it happens there? I mean it really is just sheer laziness that is making the game harder for people. If you're too casual and you don't play 12831092 hours a day and that's your excuse for not knowing how to make a focus macro for CC, why can't you just target your CC target every few casts and recast your CC if it only has a few seconds left on CC? Why can't you set your pet to passive and just hit Ctrl+1 to send it to the DPS target? <br />
<br />
These are such simple things that are so -basic- that it baffles me every time I hear &quot;herp a derp i dont play 6 hours a day&quot; come up as an excuse for why Blizzard should just let everyone aoe faceroll through everything again. Why is expecting people to use their brain functions a bad thing?<br />
<br />
These people would run out of lives playing Mario Bros. and complain Nintendo put too many holes in the ground because they're too lazy to use the Jump button, and then we'd probably still hear the same &quot;I don't play X amount of Y a day!&quot; excuse.</div></div><hr />

Just because you don't want that info on your UI doesn't automatically mean the addon sucks. I find it very useful. Plus that information doesn't need to be on your UI all the time.

<br />
The difficulty clearly isn't to hard.<br />
<br />
The type of people trying heroics is the problem and they are to blame for the heroics.<br />
<br />
Lfd is a great tool blizz have provided to help some get grps this doesn't mean that people who don't like it can't ask in trade chat guild chat w/e. People who are really using this as the base argument I wonder how u ever did dungeons before this tool was provided.<br />
<br />
Its not down to casual or hardcore either.<br />
<br />
The simply fact is that in a normal single player based game let's just take resident evil as an example an u put it on it's hardest setting you will die and die until you get use to it. By virtue you are on your own you have to reduce the difficulty setting. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately in this mmorpg people are too pig ignorant to blame at their level because they are impatient.<br />
<br />
This is down to a million reasons, failure to cc, failure to interrupt, faure to attack tank target, failure to move out of mechanics, people refusing to gem or enchant, people reusing to research there characters best stats / talents ... I could go on all day. <br />
<br />
Fact remains is the people are to blame for this issue, there is nothing to fix - people just need to not be ignorant and selfish and expect to be either a) carried through, b) told the tactics for every dam pull c) if u can't stay out of mechanics you are playing the wrong game.<br />
<br />
People need to take account for their own issues and quit the cryin while the ret of us enjoy the game that has returned back to some of the reasons we started playing this to begin with.</div></div><hr />

how about this angle: if your a casual player, say 10 hours a week, your guild doesn't do anything organized or your not in a guild. Why exactly do you need current tier epics?<br />

I have also read recently that if players want to zerg content, run normal dungeons. After the first &quot;random&quot;, is there really any great benefit to this? There is a reputation grind there with a couple of epic pieces per character at Exhalted.<br />

Blizzard had a decent balance at BC, lowered the bar for WoTLK and then raised it for Cata. Makes sense that some folks are unhappy about that.<br />
<br />
In my experience some of the heroic bosses are tank spanky, some are a decent challenge and then some are &quot;OMG, am I in a raid?&quot;. I've also noticed that in terms of drops, far more healing and tanking things drop. I think that's great for those roles, I really do, but the distribution seems skewed. With DPS having the jobs of applying CC, Interrupts and performing as if you are in a raid environment, it's no longer faceroll across the keyboard, pew pew.<br />
<br />
In conclusion I do enjoy some of the complexities but I don't feel Blizzard need to go so far in tuning up the heroics. IMHO, more of a middle-ground would have been nice to re-condition those folks that THEY turned into facerollers into expectations of skill. Maybe the heroics should have been tiered themselves somewhat. I do like a good challenge but I can't blame anyone for being a bit surprised and upset.</div></div><hr />

Not only Zarhym obviously bit a troll, he also quite blatantly insulted wide range of players that play WoW casually--meaning they have to prioritize when and for how long they can play, the term does not determine their performance in-game.<br />
<br />
I was great supporter of LFD tool when it was introduced during mid-WOTLK and avid supporter of it for the rest of it. It is with great disappointment to finally admit that Cataclysm killed LFD, at least until time when general public will overgear these instances again. Zarhym said they wanted to make Cataclysm game play challenging and fun. I fully support such statement and determination, however, such intention should not go against previously implemented solutions--e.g. LFD tool. This tool bring to life true meaning of term pick-up group: random people joining random instance with varying levels of game knowledge, gear, experience and time available. Expectation that such group will work at high level of coordination, communication and within performance limits to allow for smooth clearing of challenging content is far too stretched. It can, it sometimes does but more often than not it is not the case.<br />
<br />
I'm currently at verge of completely abandoning any attempts to join LFD with my characters because it just does not work anymore. Introduction of CC requirements, at least in early stages of Cataclysm, and damaging mechanics that are avoidable but deal significant amount of damage if not avoided have pushed &quot;difficulty&quot; of instances far away from what you can reasonably expect from LFD PUGs. I intentionally put difficulty in parenthesis as this is difficulty is artificial. Problem with the difficulty is in fact it works in a binary manner. It is either there, when you do not have CC, or it is not there, when you bring lots of it. LFD tool is not able to ensure you have class composition with viable CC similarly it cant ensure you get competent players. If shit hits the fan, you not only get little or no CC at all but also incompetent players to top it off. Unfortunately, the later situation is what I have been experiencing with LFD for quite some time now.<br />
<br />
At the end, this rant only addresses issues with LFD as Cataclysm content is very enjoyable with friends and guildmates so far.<br />
<br />
I agree with Baron01. I have been playing Wow for many years, often in large guilds but smaller ones as well. Big Guilds with solid core teams are using LFD to complete instances and gain additional Valor tokens. They even are dragging a few casual players (whether guild-mates or puggers) thru as well. But the majority of PUG attempts with other casual players are mostly failures. I managed to complete 10 days worth of PUG style LFD out of 13 days of trying. The other 3 nights I gave up after wasting 4 to 5 hours trying to complete the daily random. 2 of the LFD were lucky draw groups where 3 or 4 player where from a single guild and they knew the instance, they were done with few to no wipes. The other 8 took repeated wipes, very often the groups would lose a skilled player who gave up on the others and many times the whole group disbanded causing me to needed to re-queue 2, 3 or 4 times to get the random done. <br />
<br />
In my opinion casual tanks and healers are having too hard of a time with LFD which is why there are too few willing to tank or heal them causing the queue times to be so long for DPS. I have queued as healer and gotten quick queues, and struggled to keep groups alive due to tank or dps not having gear, skill or knowing the boss fights. Even trying to communicate and be proactive doesn't solve many issues with casual puggers. <br />
<br />
I believe the top 5 or 10% are doing good, if they are large guilds of good players willing to run daily heroics. Another 10 or 15% are managing with slight time constrains in less than all guild groups. But the majority of casual puggers are struggling beyond their time they can dedicate to the game. If you can't dedicate 5+ hours a day to the game, you will fall further and further behind. I have seen several casual tanks and healers give up trying to complete daily's or in some cases they are no longer willing to play the game.</div></div><hr />

IMHO, more of a middle-ground would have been nice to re-condition those folks that THEY turned into facerollers into expectations of skill. Maybe the heroics should have been tiered themselves somewhat. I do like a good challenge but I can't blame anyone for being a bit surprised and upset.<br />
<br />
Does Blizzard even KNOW what that means?<br />
All the news I did read on Cata Beta, and PTR were about nerf under the ground or buff above clouds. <br />
They should cut their name to Blard, because they don't have a middle term.</div></div><hr />

bwahahahah that is perfect, I shall for evermore call Blizzard Blard.<br />
<br />
edit: oh yea almost forgot. This development team has mistaken &quot;long and tedious&quot; for challenge. There was a reason we bitched about trash in vanilla and like with so many other things in Cata they've just re-introduced tedious mechanics from that and the BC era, I guess they just thought the players would &quot;forget&quot; ( too much trash, random enchants on crafted gear( oh yes blizz I want to farm for hours on the off chance I might make gear my rogue can use thank you /s), BOP crafting mats, fears/horrifies whatever the fuck they want to call it loss of character control) all of these things on top of bizarrely fast leveling(so stupid on a mmo level and a business level it boggles), linearity worse than console games, locking out content by phasing.<br />
I'm actually quite surprised they never re-introduced attunements .<br />
<br />
Anyhoo I'm done, all that and the abysmal community(hello arronwolf) is just too much. It's been a fun ride, 6 years and change. sure hope some of the new games coming out are good.</div></div><hr />

I do find the some of the fights to be exceptionally challenging, but I think that it's still reasonable. I just hate that it takes an hour an a half to two hours to clear a heroic dungeon, it would be nice if they could reduce the amount of trash from instances like Grim Batol, (Although I find Halls of Origination was very nicely balanced in this regard) but if it doesn't happen, that will be okay with me too I'll just have to start doing heroics on the weekends.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if players are really struggling to clear heroics and want to &quot;zerg&quot; content to improve gear, you can always put together a group and go back and grind WLK heroics and raids. I haven't run any recently, but I think they still drop justice points. It certainly doesn't sound like fun to me, but if you're jonesing for &quot;zerg&quot;-able content fun probably isn't a major concern to begin with.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kezaren</div><div class="date">2010-12-29, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I get home from work and immediately log on to raid (because I have no life, obviously). We spend around five hours getting to Valiona and Theralion and get in a good number of attempts before calling it a night. Then I remember that I need to get my daily heroic in before bedtime, so I ask the guild if anyone else wants to go, and I get no volunteers. So I queue up solo as a healer and soon get into a dungeon with four guys from the same guild. &quot;Great!&quot; I thought.<br />
<br />
Four and a half hours and four complete sets of people later, I finish the heroic. At two-thirty in the morning. After the dailies reset.<br />
<br />
I remember doing dungeons back in Vanilla. I hated it. I stopped playing just after reaching level 60. Came back for burning crusade, and mostly just made alts for a month. Came back for Wrath of the Lich king, made my Death Knight, got to level 80, gave some dungeons a try (I wanted those heirlooms, you see), and actually liked it. It was the first time I even considered interacting with others in the game. Joined a guild. Started raiding. Became obsessed with the game and haven't stopped playing since. But now a single dungeon can take all night again just like they did in Vanilla. Setting &quot;difficulty&quot; completely aside here, I loved it when it was bite-size. Blizzard's statements about the way things are going now makes it sound like they believe that the small and digestible heroic model of Wrath--the only dungeons I enjoyed running--was a horrible mistake. That's disappointing. I'm certainly not enjoying it as much as I used to.<br />
<br />
To all the &quot;LOL learn to play noob&quot;, &quot;Wrath baby&quot;, &quot;heroics only take me 15 minutes&quot;, &quot;too long, didn't read&quot;, &quot;get a better guild&quot;, and &quot;cool story bro&quot; replies that are sure to follow: Tell it to someone who cares.</div></div><hr />

It spams your Interface with &quot;information&quot; you don't really need, like which artefacts you can solve, etc... I don't need this on my UI all the time, in a sub menu or popup it might be usefull.<br />
Then the nodes are not really better than Gatherer/Gathermate2, the minimap Digsite display gives you a huge polygon all over your UI, the distance indicator is really useless (it should display lines on your minimap for the direction), etc...<br />
<br />
I thought the same thing about the few Archaeology addons I saw on wowinterface. I don't need to know the status of all of my artifacts all the time. I just want to know the current status of the artifact for which I just looted fragments. (Insert shameless plug) Which is why I wrote my own addon: ArchaeologyStatus. It just pops up a message onscreen that you have x/y fragments for the artifact for that race (mimics quest objective message), and throws up a small popup to solve when you have enough fragments to solve.</div></div><hr />

If you're a great player then fantastic, well done. There are far more average players than great players. Wrath was successful because it was made to be accessible, Cata is certainly more restrictive. <br />
<br />
We all ran heroics to gain emblems to upgrade our gear. The gearing pace (including leveling professions) has really been throttled in every aspect of this expansion, in hopes of slowing people down. I can grasp that this can have benefit to an extent, but I keep thinking about how this benefits Blizzard in a financial way, the longer it takes people to gear out, the more time they'll pay a monthly bill.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has also stated that they are against gold sellers, but anyone looking at an AH lately can attest that the gold sellers are making a killing in Blizzards choice of having professions trickle to max. I have leveled an enchanter to 85 that DE'd everything not useful as well as all boe greens from another 85, an 83 and two other 82's. Out of all of those characters I was only able to get Enchanting to level 505. That seems much too slow of a trickle to me.<br />
<br />
Overall Blizz did a wonderful job on the expansion. Just wish the professions were more accessible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like someone doesn't know how to configure it :)<br />
<br />
I have it set up to be unlocked and hidden. I have a few panels in my Fortress bar that I've set up. I can mouse over them to see what Artifacts I need to get and what Dig Sites are available. You can click a button on a LDB display to show or hide the main info.<br />
<br />
The biggest advantage for me is you can also set it up with distances to the nearest Dig Site. That's invaluable for me as it means I don't have to open the map and figure out by hand which is nearest to me.<br />
<br />
Once you arrive at a digsite and do a survey you can set it up to have a colored square come up that shows you how far away from your survey peg your are. So if you land and it's red you walk into the square above your head is also red. Next you'll get yellow so you walk into the square above your head goes from green to yellow. Repeat until you find it.<br />
<br />
But when I'm not doing Arch. for the moment it's completely hidden away.<br />
<br />

<br />
Well a friend of mine also turned me onto Archaeology Helper.<br />
<br />
It's great.<br />
<br />
It works like this : You install it and get this little bar thingy. Click a spade to bring up a HUD.<br />
<br />
You do a survey and click the color of the survey peg you get. This makes a coloured arc on the HUD display. Red is a very wide arc while yellow is a bit thinner with green being the smallest Arc. It uses the players facing to draw a line on the HUD and as you walk from the survey peg it reduces the distance between you and the arc on the HUD.<br />
<br />
So with both Archy and Archaeology Helper this is how I hunt for nodes :<br />
<br />
(1) Survey<br />
(2) Make sure I'm facing in the direction the survey peg thingy is pointing. For ease I make sure I'm right on the survey peg and facing the way it is facing (the way the telescope is pointing)<br />
(3) Click Red and a Red Arc comes up on Arh's HUD.<br />
(4) Walk until the green square above my toon goes red and I'm in the Red Arc Area<br />
(5) It should be yellow now. Repeat Step 2 - 3 except this time I'm putting down a Yellow Arc on my HUD and walking till the square above my head is Yellow. <br />
(6) You should now have a pair of arcs on your HUD and an area where they intersect. You need to aim to survey in that area.<br />
(7) Survey again and it should now be green. Place down a green arc on your HUD and move until you in where it intersects.<br />
<br />
Archaeology Helper is the perfect addition to Archy :)</div></div><hr />

This is true to a degree on some fights (Ozumat as you mentioned, the commander in SFK), but on many fights (I tend to relate this most to Slabhide in Stonecore as 100% of non-tank damage is avoidable) it is actually the damage dealers playing badly that just makes it so the healer is incredibly stressed when, in fact, they shouldn't be.<br />
<br />
For the most part, I think the heroics are all spot-on. None of them are particularly difficult, and the only time they are is when you have an exceptionally bad player, or more. Then again, I haven't done a heroic yet that wasn't at least 4/5 guild, so a lot of the pug distress is lost on me.</div></div><hr />

Archy does in fact start out with the info compressed on the top center of your UI, but with a little reading you could have discovered that all you need to do is Shift + Left click to condense that down to a hover over ability via the Archy icon. Myself I think its average but useful with some of the info it gives you. Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
The Kinect feature while I can see where it could be 'fun', however, don't think it could be viable. Especially in a raiding format.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siph</div><div class="date">2010-12-30, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While the other features of Archy are useful and help to set it apart from others of its kind, the most important part of Archy is arguably its node database (or more precisely, the ability to collect nodes and make a node database). At first glance, Archaeology nodes may appear to be random within the dig sites, but in reality, they are static. It is completely random which nodes you will get, but each node still has a set location. Knowing this, and realizing that there is a large variance on the survey tool at a &quot;red&quot; distance (up to around 90 degrees in either direction), you can quickly figure out where nodes are located based on only one or two surveys for small to medium dig sites. Archy capitalizes on this by collecting all of the node data into a database; after you loot fragments, Archy will mark the spot you looted them from on your map.<br />
<br />
If this is the most important feature then I don't see any point in getting this addon. Any decent gathering addon will capture the nodes, and they are not static at all. At least not in a way that your first 800 nodes will help you find #801. And of course it works better for smaller digsites, because a red light gives you fewer options there anyway.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aggression</div><div class="date">2010-12-30, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heroic difficulty is ok. It brings guilds together, as it's alot easier to clear them as guild than a pug.<br />
What I don't like with pugs is that if you're not a good CC (read: don't have any cc at all as warriors, death knights etc), and been in queue for 30-55 minutes, enter...and get kicked out just a bit later, because the group need cc and not anyone. So 50 minutes of waiting, just to get back into a 50 min queue is NOT ok. That is why I only do heroics with guild. Don't need anything from it, except daily valor points. So don't see why I should rush in as tank or dps, be there for 2h failing with diffrent group setups, bad dps, bad cc, bad healing or whatever.<br />
Get ppl you trust and know, and any heroic should take less than 1h.</div></div><hr />

<br />
again, we go back to the Health Club analogy. You are paying a monthly fee for access to tools to attain your goals and the enjoyment you derive from those activities. It may be necessary for you to adjust your goals to those which reflect the time you can dedicate to them.<br />
<br />
The above is me, in a nutshell.<br />
<br />
I play the game to get away from it all, not to have additional commitments in my life... so I play solo, and don't guild/pug/raid.<br />
<br />
Same with my gym membership: I show-up when I feel like it, and do whatever I feel like doing that day. I do have the option of signing-up for group workout sessions, or paying for a personal trainer to get/keep me motivated... <br />

Then Heroics are not for you. Lets define a few things here..<br />
<br />
Casuals:<br />
-Limited amount of time to play<br />
-Want to see the content like everyone else<br />
<br />
Hardcore:<br />
-Substantial amount of time to play<br />
-Wants a tough challenge<br />
-Raiding<br />
<br />
Normal dungeons:<br />
-Takes usually an hour to finish<br />
-Content<br />
<br />
Heroic Dungeons<br />
-Takes more time to finish (2 hours)<br />
-Same Content, just harder<br />
-Prepares players for raiding<br />
<br />
As far as I see, casual players are getting through what blizzard has made for those players. There's no reason for raiding because raiding requires more of your time, does it not? We're not talking heroic times here, we're talking 4 hours of your time. If you cannot dedicate this sort of time towards raiding, there is absolutely no reason for you to be getting the gear from heroics which is tailored for the preparation of raiding; which you wouldn't do because it eats up more of your time. Why are you in such a rush to get heroic gear if it's not going to be used?<br />
<br />
Yes, we live in a selfish, instant gratification world these days but still.. Time and effort put in=reward. This goes across all things in life including your job. I've seen VERY skilled people in my life never move up within their workplace or other life matters because they don't have the time, or simple don't want to. Where on the contrast I've seen people less skilled then them put the time and effort into it and achieve some higher paying job, possibly even becoming the more skilled person's boss. Over time, this person with less skill may even surpass the skill of the other person just because they have more time and effort. This is (contrary to some peoples belief) how it works in the real world.<br />
<br />
TL;DR<br />
Casual people are getting the rewards tailored for their time frame and playstyle. Hardcore people are getting the rewards for their time frame and playstyle. Heroic difficulty is fine.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

That is exactly what I've been trying to point out as wrong though, there are far too little of us hardcores left. I play with casuals, why? b/c they are now the defining majority of this game. So many hardcores quit during Wrath because of the ridiculous easiness of it all, but almost none of them have returned. What Blizzard has done is nothing more than alienated about 85% of their current player base, which won't look good for their bottom line once casuals start quitting.<br />
<br />
Vanilla was a ridiculous grindfest that made it so when you got something done it was a huge accomplishment, but the only people who got anything done were the super hardcore, did we see any casual guilds down 40-man Naxx? No, so casuals kept to easy dungeons and the 10-man raids before they were nerfed into 5-mans. Over the course of BC it got more casual friendly in raiding, like Kara, but still the endgame was hard enough that it was guild that at least had a more hardcore core of raiders was able to clear. Wrath made it even more accessible, allowing even casual 1-2 night raiding guilds to actually clear current raid content. Now that we are in Cata, Blizzard have shoved us back to the days of vanilla, a grueling grindfest that benefits no one but the hardcore and casuals be damned.</div></div><hr />

honestly the major problem is in one area !pug lfg, be it heroic or raid lfg!cost of repair !blizzard should remove cost of repair!only for heroic and raid lfg built team tho no premade whatsover be it 2 player or more it has the be a fully lfg built team for heroic and raid lfg tool.why?some might be astonished by this, but i hate premade group ,it make everything too easy but there is a problem with this ,its cost of repair!!often in a pug group, its an issue ,.yes im a pugger!and i like it that way.on average its more fun, but blizzard has to bring cost down for lfg found raider or heroic.check it out on illidan nobody use the lfg tool for raid and not many for heroic(alliance side)so i ask for this since not many use it anyway stop the cost of repair for those fully lfged group!<br />
ps:ty blizzard!great expension by the way .i had to reroll an undead lol cause of the lore .i guess its way more or will be way more chaotic in the futur then just cataclysm lol<br />
sorry if the construction of my post is weird ,first time i reply but i felt the heroic post was an issue i had to mention!</div></div><hr />

The way to be hardcore when you have plenty of time : Hard Mode<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont have 3hrs (wait time , fail time , time to completion) to invest in a freaking heroic dunjons with shitty gear with 3 bosses , <br />
<br />
heroic 5 men should be around max 45 minutes including wait time, its not a freaking 3hrs raid we are doing here , it's a 5 men.<br />
<br />
Your right.. Heroics should be about 45 mins, which they are if you find capable people. The mechanics are not that hard if people are paying attention. I've gotten into some horrible LFD groups but we made through it because the people learned what they were doing wrong and corrected it. Look, heroics are only going to be as hard as the group makes them out to be. If you really really have idiots keeping you in a dungeon for 2 hours that's what the kick tool is used for. If people are not paying attention to what the GL(Group Leader) or someone else who knows the fight might be saying then it's not worth your time having them in the group. Get em out and move on with hopefully more competent people.<br />
<br />
This is a social game, and as such to accomplish something (AS A GROUP) You have to work together (AS A GROUP). If this means you need to pay attention to interrupts, THEN DO IT. IF this means getting out of the 1-shot mechanic, THEN DO IT. If this means stop dps tunneling and kill the adds, FOR GOD-SAKE, DO IT. Hey maybe you might even be the problem in the group? I suggest listening and doing as much as you can to help. A failing 5-man dungeon group is never going to fix itself. Coordination and teamwork is KEY.<br />
<br />
If people can't find time for coordination or teamwork because they don't have the time, that's not being casual, that's downright laziness.</div></div><hr />
