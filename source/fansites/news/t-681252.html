Shadowmourne - Legendary Axe<br />
The end of the PTR is near and it's time for a new preview of Shadowmourne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49623/shadowmourne/), mostly to give you a much more interesting video of the weapon. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that you will have to defeat Sindragosa to claim the weapon and it will take months before the encounter is unlocked on live servers. <br />

<br />
The first quest is given by Darion Mograine in the Icecrown Citadel, the only prerequisite is to be friendly with the Ashen Verdict (http://db.mmo-champion.com/f/1156/the-ashen-verdict/). Of course it's not that simple and the very first quest will require you to obtain Primordial Saronite (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49908/primordial-saronite/) x 25 along with quest items from Festergut (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=892) and Rotface (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=899). Primordial Saronite (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49908/primordial-saronite/) is the new rare reagent from raid bosses (The new Crusader's Orb (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/47556/crusader-orb/) basically) and it won't be easy to get 25 of them ... <br />
<br />
The Sacred and the Corrupt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24545/the-sacred-and-the-corrupt/)<br />
It is against my judgment that I present you this errand, &lt;race&gt;, as it will likely end in your undoing. Ignore my counsel and embark on the endeavor, and I shall provide you with the knowledge and resources to see it through.<br />
<br />
You must return to Frostmourne Cavern and recover Light's Vengeance, Arthas' discarded hammer. Reforged with saronite and etched with the acidic blood of the Lich King's abominations, it will provide the foundation for our work. <br />
<br />
Unholy Infusion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24749/unholy-infusion/)<br />
Before your weapon can reach its full potential it must be endowed with its signature powers. First among them is unholiness. You must seek out and defeat the one called Professor Putricide, but his death is not your only goal. You must use his resources against him.<br />
<br />
Find a way to absorb his mutated slime. Use the foul substance to infuse your weapon with the power of the unholy. Only when this has been done shall I reveal your next task. <br />
<br />
Blood Infusion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24756/blood-infusion/)<br />
Your weapon is now prepared to be endowed with the power of blood. You are to face Queen Lana'thel in battle and bathe the axe in her Blood Mirror power. When it has been fully infused, you must slay her unmercifully.<br />
<br />
May her screams pierce the ears of the Lich King as he awaits his fate. <br />
<br />
Frost Infusion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24757/frost-infusion/)<br />
Shadow's Edge is prepared to receive its final infusion of power. Sindragosa, the enemy's own mount, must fall. But before she is brought down, you must sustain three of her frozen breath attacks without tasting death. <br />
<br />
Without his dragon, nothing shall stand between you and the Lich King. <br />
<br />
The Splintered Throne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24548/the-splintered-throne/)<br />
The Lich King's throne once served as his prison. Kil'jaeden himself crafted the vessel of icy crystals from the twisting nether. Its sole purpose was to hold Ner'zhul's vengeful spirit. When Arthas struck the crystal with Frostmourne, he released Ner'zhul's soul, allowing it to merge with with his own. Splinters from that impact are now scattered throughout the citadel.<br />
<br />
I shall require those shards, held only by the Lich King's most powerful servants, to seal the power contained in your blade. <br />
<br />
A Feast of Souls (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24547/a-feast-of-souls/)<br />
Shadow's Edge is among the greatest weapons a &lt;class&gt; could hope to obtain. Is your lust for power sated, &lt;race&gt;? &lt;You feel Mograine's penetrating gaze.&gt;<br />
<br />
I thought not. A final warning then... You now embark on the most treacherous leg of your quest. Bridle your aspirations, for if your aims are impure then your life, your very soul, is forfeit.<br />
<br />
The weapon you hold is but an empty husk, a mere shadow of what it may become. Only the devouring of a thousand souls will unlock its true potential. <br />
<br />
Shadowmourne ... (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24549/shadowmourne/)<br />
Highlord Darion Mograine wants you to bring him Shadow's Edge.<br />
<br />
This quest isn't fully implemented yet but already rewards you with Shadowmourne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49623/shadowmourne/) ... <br />
<br />
The Lich King's Last Stand (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24748/the-lich-kings-last-stand/)<br />
Shadowmourne; a newly forged weapon already steeped in this world's history, reborn into an unrivaled destiny. With this weapon you bear a solemn responsibility, and the time to carry out that charge is at hand. <br />
<br />
Take this weapon of myth and legend and march on the enemy. Avenge the countless heroes lost in his merciless campaign. Bring rest to their tortured souls. <br />
<br />
Steel yourself, &lt;class&gt;, and guide Shadowmourne to fulfill the purpose of its creation. <br />

Wonder if the stack actually removes the bonus strength after you do the AoE<br />

<br />
They already said that...many times. No we will never be able to obtain frostmourne.<br />
<br />
Also do you actually hear those whispers all the time you have Shadowmourne equipped? Or are these just the ICC whispers..like with Yogg.</div></div><hr />

Is this really correct?<br />
<br />
According to the Wowhead PTR site, you get Shadowmourne and -then- get a quest to kill the Lich King. Having to kill the Lich King in order to get Shadowmourne would make very little sense since Mograine has you create the weapon to destroy the Lich in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my opinion, I think it is kinda stupid you need to beat the Lich King to make the Axe that is (by quest line) supposed to help beat the Lich King. I am sure they could have made some difficult task to forge Shadowmourne without needing to beat the Lich King.</div></div><hr />

Maybe we can't kill the lich king. Except we have shadowmourne...and killing the lich king for real is actually the hard mode of the encounter (only possible by doing something awesome cool while at least one guy in the raid wears shadowmounre). Otherwise we lose..get rescued somehow and the ashen verdict goes &quot;nice try, better luck next time..try some new lewts we found inside ICC, maybe you can do it with the help of that *chest appears as non-hardmode loot*&quot;<br />

Damn...infusion part needs to be in 25 man, missed that :D<br />

The orc could also be in non-set plate.<br />

<br />
<br />
Am I missing something or will every Warrior,DK and Paladin have this weapon? What's the limiting factor here, I'm not seeing it.<br />
<br />
Same as all the other legendaries. Theoretically everyone will run around with the weapon. Practically...they won't because you have to raid pretty much. Hard-modes will probably play a role here and as much as people cry..no quest-blue/naxx equipped raid will kill the first trash in ICC.<br />
It will be as common as the ulduar hammer. Pretty common in hardcore guilds...less common (very rare) outside of this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qrio</div><div class="date">2009-11-30, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 questions come to mind:<br />
<br />
1) Do you need Shadow's Edge to start the quest? I'd assume so, but nowhere in the initial quests I see it as a requirement.<br />
2) Do you actually hear those whispers only when you have the axe? It sounds quite strange if that's the case, although if it is - that's actually great<br />
<br />
Khornn - 25 primordial saronite will be quite hard to get if you are not actively raiding, not to mention some of the boss kills (which I'm sure at least some of them will be on hard modes).<br />
<br />
You won't see every Warrior, DK and Paladin with it.</div></div><hr />

You enter the Frozen Throne.<br />
Morgraine welcomes you.<br />
Morgraine hands over Shadowmourne to you.<br />
You engage the bad guy.<br />
a) You fail at defeating the lich king, you are not worth wielding the weapon. Morgraine takes it away.<br />
b) You defeat the lich king with Shadowmourne, Morgraine congratulates you and you may now wield the weapon.<br />
Remember this one setback incident, I remember a similar fight mechanic. Legendaries for a single fight only.<br />
That's how it may work.<br />

You do that huge chain to assemble Shadowmourne before that though, surely Mograine won't just go &quot;Okay, you made the cool axe, but we'll be keeping it until you kill the Lich!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Yeah because he knows how dangerous this mighty weapon can be in the wrong hands (like in the hands of some weak being who is easily pulled to the &quot;dark side&quot; or some guy who is resurrected by the lich king).<br />

The orc could also be in non-set plate.<br />
Same as all the other legendaries. Theoretically everyone will run around with the weapon. Practically...they won't because you have to raid pretty much. Hard-modes will probably play a role here and as much as people cry..no quest-blue/naxx equipped raid will kill the first trash in ICC.<br />
It will be as common as the ulduar hammer. Pretty common in hardcore guilds...less common (very rare) outside of this.<br />
<br />
<br />
the only limiting factor are the 25 Primordial Saronite? when thats true, it all comes down to gold. Primordial Saronite isn BoP and the new Crusader's Orb, they will be available in the auction house quickly. when Primordial Saronite will be the only limiting factor, and you dont have to kill bosses in hardmodes, then everyone will be running around with shadowmourne.</div></div><hr />

I wonder whether there'll be any limitations on being able to complete that quest other than the 25 primordial saronite. And well, killing the lich king obviously.<br />
<br />
Like, any rare drops from bosses, or a single item, whatnot.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you'll end up with all 6 2h wielders in the raid being able to get that item before long.<br />
Seems strange for a &quot;legendary&quot; item.</div></div><hr />

It won't be hard for a guild to get 25 and give them to one person. It will be very hard for a person who isn't chosen by his guild to get 25.<br />
<br />
Sure, eventually we'll all be drowning in emblems with nothing to buy, but it will take at least a couple months into ICC, so that by the time even semi-casuals are able to amass enough Primordial Saronite to start the pre-Shadow's Edge quest, most serious guilds will have one or two Shadowmournes already.</div></div><hr />

Dude, you're lacking major imagination/creativity. Why is it impossible that you get a shadowmourne for the fight only..noone said something about sockets being in this temporary weapon (it will still be awesome, you know?).<br />

I expect this new legendary to be about the rarity of val'anyr, if not slightly rarer. I would expect this to take a lot longer to obtain than Val'anyr, though, what with the limited attempts, the shadowfrost shards and soul fragments required, and the gating that ICC will see.

<br />
<br />
First of all, the shadowfrost shards seem to be ordinary Quest Items (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50274/shadowfrost-shard/). So it seems that everyone who has the quest can loot the shards from &quot;the Lich King's most powerful servants&quot; so in game speak most likely Icecrown Bosses. The shards are not BoP so its unlikely they are handled like Splinters of Atiesh (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22726) or Fragments of Val'anyr (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45038).<br />

Primordial Saronite costs 22 Emblems of Frost on PTR so you actually need 550 EoF to finish the first quest.<br />
T10.251 costs between 60 and 90 EoF per piece (afair) and you NEED to buy the ilevel 251 T10 pieces in order to upgrade them to 264 and later to 277. So getting 4-pc-T10 alone will cost you 300 EoF.</div></div><hr />

Drops off of bosses in 25 man, probably guaranteed to drop in hard modes, much like the fragments of Val'anyr. They may let you ogle Shadowmourne, but they aren't giving it up easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yes you are right, it seems like everyone who is on that quest can loot the shards from killed bosses. My guess is that they won't drop on every kill, but more likely 30-50% dropchance. Since there are about 9 bosses (excluding Gunship, Valithria Dreamwalker and Lich King himself) in ICC who could drop the shards it's likely that it will take you many weeks of clearing ICC in order to finish just that step of the questline. Don't forget, the harvesting of 1000 souls is still to come in the questchain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i mean before you have the three &quot;gardians&quot; sindragosa , the blood queen and Dr putricide avaible it doesn't seems that hard to get 25 saronite till that and if you've to kill arthas you could wait even more . <br />
<br />
btw very nice visual effects !<br />
<br />
also do somebody knows how many emblems the bosses will drop ? the colyseum was 3 since there were just a few bosses but with 4 mods avaible it's quite a large number of them . it'll cost 90 for big piece and 60 for small one and u have to buy the first version of t10 so it'll require at least 300 of them to get the 4t10 wich is equal to 13 primal saronite <br />
<br />
if you had the daily random + raid weekly ( is that still implemented ? ) well by focusing on the quest it shouldn't take too long</div></div><hr />

<br />
14 Frosts from Daily Random Heroic<br />
5 Raid Weekly Quest<br />
4 VoA new boss (10 and 25)<br />
3 per ICC boss equals 24 badges from 25's and 10's (only 4 bosses available)<br />
all this totals 47 badges per week maximum.<br />
<br />
575/45 = 12.2 weeks so 13 weeks. Now its true that 4 more bosses with be introduced 3-4 weeks after this first set...and you can't even complete the first quest and get Shadow's Edge until then. But assuming you start farming all 8 bosses the first day that the second batch of 4 bosses is released.<br />
<br />
You'd have 188 badges saved up when 3.3.1 hits...and then you start making 71 badges a week. That's an additional 5.4 weeks. So WHEN the quest CAN be completed...if you had no help form your guild with primordial saronite ores, and you farmed the released bosses every week they were available (even week 1)....we're looking at 9-10 weeks to get all the ores to complete the first step.<br />
<br />
NOW....let's assume you guild helps you out and the DAY 3.3.1 hits where you can finally get your SHadow's Edge, you clear Rotface and Festergut and claim you new shiny epic axe immediately. You are now on the Infusion quests. Let's assume that you will one shot all the infusions...(probably not...but for the sake of Shadowmourne farming...let's go ahead an assume). However, they will come out every 3-4 weeks...let's say 3 weeks just to make it shorter than it probably will be.<br />
<br />
That means were looking at 6 weeks of no progress on the quests...or simply trying to get the infusions. 6 weeks you have no control over.<br />
<br />
Now you have to worry about getting 60 shadowfrost shards. Let's assume 2 things...since these shards are labled &quot;Quest Item&quot;...they are shared and multiple people can loot them if they're on the quest (ie they have a Shadow's Edge equipped)...so no guild distributing. AND, let's assume they are 100% drop rate from all raid bosses. AND let's assume your raid 1 shots all available bosses.<br />
<br />
1. There are 12 raid bosses available including Lich King. Assuming you farm all of them the first week they are all introduced...thats 5 weeks of getting Shadowfrost Shards.<br />
<br />
We're now at 11 weeks MINIMUM. <br />
<br />
You now have to gather 1000 souls. This task is generally looked upon as the easy step...however, no one really knows which souls you have to collect. Let's assume that they can only be collected form enemies inside ICC raids. AND, let's assume that your guild isn't going to sit there and farm trash (not killing raid bosses and waiting 1-2 hours for trash to respawn and farm all night). How many mobs are actually in a ICC full clear. Most people I've talked to say 100 maybe. Let's DOUBLE that just for the sake of arguement. That means I'm assuming you can farm them in the 10 and 25 man version..or that the people are wrong and there's a lot more mobs than one would think. I'm assuming this cause there's no point in assuming the other...you could bedone in a day of killing elites or non elite undead if they didn't have to be in ICC.<br />
<br />
That's another 5 weeks of raiding both 10 and 25 man ICC...full clears each week. And remember all this time I'm assuming you kill every boss available first week they are released.<br />
<br />
Add it all up...16 weeks of raiding AFTER you finish the first quest (to throw out all those people saying they could farm up 40k gold and buy all their primordial saronite ores). <br />
<br />
16 weeks = 4 months minimum, so we're looking at first Shadowmournes appearing at a minimum...April.<br />
Most people were speculating a 3rd quarter 2010 release for Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
To me, it looks like the challenge of getting a Shadowmourne isn't the quest itself...but completeing the quest before the weapon itself becomes obsolete.<br />
<br />
EDIT: okok, you could see one 5 weeks earlier from a random guild who dedicates itself to being the first guild to get one. IE...they're going to sit an entire week and clear trash respawns and then finally kill the bosses on Mon before reset. Your average guild isn't going to do this. So I predict the first Shadowmourne to appear 11 weeks after 3.3.1 hits with the second set of bosses, which would be mid to late March.</div></div><hr />

The only thing tradable is the PRimordial Saronite ores, which I've already said...let's assume that you have 25 the day 3.3.1hits and you can complete the quest immediately. <br />
<br />
Don't forget you only get 5 tries at even the normal mode infusion bosses per week. And, you have to put yourself in harms way more than one per fight, which increases teh difficulty of your raid completing the quests too.<br />
<br />
I'm saying its 11 week minimum after you've collected the Saronite ores, more likely 16 weeks since your guild won't sit there and farm trash for you all week long before you finally try and clear the bosses.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Since those Shadowfrost shards are labled &quot;Quest Items&quot; its safe to assume they won't start dropping until you are on that quest...which means you have done all the infusions...which means clearing all the way to the Lich king. THEN you have to start collecting 60 shards...1 per 25 man boss = 60/12 = 5 weeks minimum of shadowfrost shard farming. <br />
<br />
Repeat...you will have to compelte the frost infusion quest by taking 3 frost breaths from Sindragosa before you can even start collecting the SHadowfrost shards...cause you won't be on that step of the quest chain yet.</div></div><hr />

This is what I've been thinking. Sure, the questline will take a crapton of time to complete, but it looks like basically everyone can pick up the quest at about the same time.<br />
<br />
From what I've read so far, I see no reason why all my 2h melee won't have this item within a month of each other. NOT like Val'anyr, which only 1 person can work on at a time (if you want to ever complete it :P).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to remember it will depend what kind of server you're on. If you're on a high pop server th saronites will be alot cheaper. <br />
<br />
On my old server which was low pop, Crusader Orbs went for about 3-4k in the first month or so. But on my friends server (high pop) they were only 1.5-2k-ish. <br />
<br />
Thankfully I have about 140k gold with about 40k in mats saved up :)</div></div><hr />

This feels... odd to me; could this really be intended? Obviously, Blizzard doesn't have a problem with a guild having multiple legendaries (see: Val'anyr), but in such a short time frame? I think at least one of our assumptions must be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I honestly dont think Blizz would do that, since you could have people with alot of gold getting it for offspec like the same month as your main spec 2hand dps'ers. <br />
<br />
Example: I'm a holy pally with 100k gold. I just buy all the saronites and do the quest chain like the main spec dps'ers and get my Shadowmourne the same week/within a week of them.</div></div><hr />

I hardly think that Minimum 16 weeks is a short period of time. 16 weeks of Ulduar raiding gets more than 1 hammer.<br />
<br />
And I remember a guild on my old server getting 7 glaives to drop their first 3 months of Killing Illidan. Granted that's some sbscene luck, but they had 3 2x glaive rogues and their Fury had a MH before Sunwell released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I meant the interval between subsequent Shadowmournes, not the total time to acquire each one. 16 weeks of Ulduar raiding will net 1 hammer plus shards toward a second, not 2 or more hammers almost concurrently.<br />
<br />
With regard to the glaives, since they were random drops, I don't think they can be compared/contrasted to this situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the deal, even MOST hardcore guilds will have not have Shadowmournes at 16 weeks...with the limited attempts at new bosses, we're looking at Infusion quests being done a lot slower than people think. I predict most hardcore guilds seeing their shadowmournes at 20 weeks. And 20 weeks...I'd say it would be reasonable to see more than 1 legendary in the guild at the same time. So it'll take a lot longer for 1 to appear, but I think you'll see a sudden influx of 2-3 per guild when they do start happening. <br />

Yes, every 2hded melee will have a Shadow's Edge, the epic version which requires only a non raid quest, a lot of gold or time in raids and dedication to daily randoms, or a guilds help.<br />
<br />
Big deal, you got a 25 man normal ilvl 2hded axe out of it. That was going to happen anyway...ilvl 245 Justicebringers and Dual-Blades are a dime a dozen these days.<br />
<br />
The legendary version will require full clears of the last 25 man raid for multiple weeks, of which you get a very short supply of attempts per week. Forget puggable TotC...you won't be pugging ICC 25 man. It won't be every tom dick or harry getting the Legedary version...there will be a ton of people still collecting shards when Catacylsm hits the shelves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its the same Ilvl as another 2hded axe that drops from the frist few bosses in the 25 normal. Granted its better itemized...but its the same ilvl and listed dps as the other 2hders that are confirmed to drop from 25 normal.<br />
<br />
I fail to see how the Epic quest version is imbal, there's no OP proc...its a beefed up Justicebringer/Dual-Blade. And it'd be silly not to expect a better 2hder in ICC 25 man than what meleers had already.</div></div><hr />

I see your point, but in a previous post, I had already noted that Blizzard doesn't seem to mind guilds having multiple legendaries -- Val'anyr, for example; there are many guilds out there with multiple hammers. <br />
<br />
My point is this: for legendaries that are acquired by means other than random drop chance (collection of shards, quests, etc.), Blizzard seems to put other &quot;gates&quot; in so that multiples are realistically only worked on after the first one is complete. The only gate to legendaries like the glaives is the RNG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again...who cares about when you get a Shadow's Edge...its the same ilvl as all the other normal 25 man ICC weapon drops. Getting a Shadow's edge is irrelevant. People need to stop looking at the epic version, and start really looking at how much time its going to take to turn it into a Shadowmourne...cause the real grind doesn't start until you have a Shadow's Edge.</div></div><hr />

The gate to this legendary is time....and a LOT of it. Time which is very limited, videos are already available of Cataclysm gameplay...<br />

What's the difference in buying one...or raiding to get a drop. You still got to kill 2 ICC bosses who are halfway through the instance. Only this way if you're gonna buy it, it'll cost you a lot of gold AND raiding time instead of just a drop.<br />

The Lich King's throne once served as his prison. Kil'jaeden himself crafted the vessel of icy crystals from the twisting nether. Its sole purpose was to hold Ner'zhul's vengeful spirit. When Arthas struck the crystal with Frostmourne, he released Ner'zhul's soul, allowing it to merge with with his own. Splinters from that impact are now scattered throughout the citadel.<br />

<br />
The shards are listed as &quot;quest items&quot;...unlike the Ulduar hammer shards. Means that the shards won't start dropping until someone is on that quest. And, lots of speculation that they will behave like most other quest items...in that multiple people will be able to loot them. However, to even be ON this quest you have to defeat Sindragosa...the 2nd to last boss in ICC...which you only get a very limited amount of attempts at, AND you have to take multiple frost attacks from her...making the encounter more difficult for your raid...<br />

Legendaries are just nice to have, make some people feel special, but do not bestow God mode on a player. Just because you have 24 cool friends who help you get it doesn't mean you are a good player or anything special at PVP, so I wouldn't worry about gangs of legendary gankers in the BGs any time soon. <br />

The great thing is that it will give the people who need their epeen stroking something else to do than fly over the well in Dalaran with their latest mounts :D</div></div><hr />

I disagree a bit. My idea would be to make 2 version of legendary. 10 &amp; 25 mans and make it scalable with your caracter lvl to a maximum cap. So it would worth it to get one, instead of just swapping it shortly after with a purple weapon.</div></div><hr />

Most guilds would not complete one in a year of Molten Core farming.<br />
<br />
Sulfuras - Reuires a 1% drop, some tradable ingots and a somewhat expensive crafted component. At 1% on the eye around 50% of guilds would have the opportunity to make one after a year.<br />
<br />
Ateish - Reuired a bunch of splinters which were common enough you could confidently get them while raiding as normal, then killing some bosses you were probably going to kill anyway. Limited only by how many times you were willing to run Naxx.<br />
<br />
Warglaives - Just dropped, but rare and not as cool unless you got both.<br />
<br />
Thori'Dal - Drop, boring, useless.<br />
<br />
Val'Anyr - Collect fragments then do a semi-hard mode. Limited only by how determined your guild is to run ulduar every week.<br />
<br />
Shadowmourne - Requires 25 of a tradable item, then raiding an instance you're going to be raiding anyway. I forsee every two-handed axe user at least being on this quest and if Cataclysm takes long enough, they'll all complete their Shadowmourne.<br />
<br />
Having suffered the crushing disappointment on every kill of Baron Geddon waiting for the 2nd Binding, or Illidan being next in line for Warglaives... I simultaneously feel spiteful for what I've been through and optimistic that future legendaries will likely follow the Shadowmourne model for completion.</div></div><hr />

my question is everyone on the questline allowed to loot it? (quest loot) so a splinter shard can be given to every raider on that part? or 1000 souls?<br />

On topic, the reaping of a thousand souls seems a little vague. Is it 1k kills in general? Or 1k mobs in icecrown? i've tried to find more info but i failed at the internets so far. Or some specific action in which your character auto reaps the souls (perhaps killing a specific boss; i.e. the lich king and claiming the souls he claimed prior?).<br />

No one really knows which mobs it'll be, becuase Blizz hasn't told us...and you can't go that far into the quest on the PTR. I personally would assume that it would be mobs found in 25 man ICC...as its a 25 man raid quest. I think its pretty safe to assume that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
&quot;The Light will abandon you, Hero, just as it did me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Take them, Mortal. These souls will again be mine, soon enough.&quot;<br />
&quot;Soon, Mortal, you too shall have a blade for a prison.&quot;<br />
&quot;Remember, Hero, I too once sought a weapon of great power.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see you too are gathering souls for your remnant. Are we really so different, Champion?&quot;<br />
&quot;*[Laugh]* Look at you Child, would be wielder of souls. You can not fathom the power that lies in my command.&quot;<br />
&quot;Come to me, Pretender. Feed my blade!&quot;<br />
&quot;My challenges have strengthened you, Champion. You shall server me well. *[Laugh]*&quot;<br />
&quot;Never have I had cause to regret sparing your life, Mortal. Always, you find ways to amuse me.&quot;<br />
&quot;The moment is soon at hand, Mortal. You shall toil for eternity, in a new Azeroth.&quot;<br />
&quot;More souls. Yes, more! You will find it hard to stop.&quot;<br />
&quot;The hunger your weapon feels is but a shade of what awaits. Do you want to see real hunger, real power? Continue onward, Hero. I am waiting.&quot;<br />
&quot;You stumble upon in darkness. There's no Light here, no mercy. Icecrown has claimed the souls of better heroes than You.&quot;<br />
&quot;Your heart, it's incessant drumming disgusts me. I will silence it, as I did my own!&quot;<br />

The 1000 kills reminds me of grinding to be a Dark Knight in FF11. Though that wasn't too bad. 100 or 150, or something. Though with how slow that game is, it may be similar to 1000 in WoW heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If thats the case it seems kinda crappy to trade off 400 str for an AoE effect, on boss fights at least, where usually you are attacking 1 mob. Do you really build it up to 400 str only to do some 2k aoe, and then go back to 0 str?<br />
<br />
I don't play a melee, but I'm wondering what melee think, would you rather have the 400 str or the aoe? It just seems kinda bad that you don't get to keep the 400 str buff for long (how long does the 10 stacks stay up before it dissipates to the AoE effect and resets?)<br />

well even if it goes to 0 still as a meele u can gain back pretty fast those stacks back.also dont forget the stats of the weapon.they are so imba that if u are getting 10 stacks plus the stats and plus the aoe,well that would be a prtty sweet bug for the lucky meele chars that ahve the weap but also that would leave the other players back at their dps dmg.so i think it is fair that after the aoe the stacks goes to 0 and then u have to collect them egain.trust me it is not that hard as it sounds</div></div><hr />

I wonder whether there'll be any limitations on being able to complete that quest other than the 25 primordial saronite. And well, killing the lich king obviously.<br />
<br />
Like, any rare drops from bosses, or a single item, whatnot.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you'll end up with all 6 2h wielders in the raid being able to get that item before long.<br />
Seems strange for a &quot;legendary&quot; item.<br />

For dps warriors most likely we'll be using a gimmick spec for the fight so we can reach last stand to ensure we don't get owned even with outside CD's. Fury warriors warriors can still have a shield with their Shadows Edge on for shield wall, so that will help.</div></div><hr />

For dps warriors most likely we'll be using a gimmick spec for the fight so we can reach last stand to ensure we don't get owned even with outside CD's. Fury warriors warriors can still have a shield with their Shadows Edge on for shield wall, so that will help. <br />
<br />
Frost Breath does only 37-43k damage, unless they recently changed that (of course, there's still the aura tick for 4,5k).<br />
<br />
I don't think that surviving Sindragoa's breath is that hard, considering this axe is for plate users (and plate is itemized with loads of Stamina). There is Frost Aura + Aura Mastery, the resistance flask, various kinds of damage absorbing shields, Pain Suppression, your own defensive cooldowns, etc.</div></div><hr />

Its fine its not easy to obtain. It sucks however that a guild decides who gets Shadowmourne first in its guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guilds decide who gets everything first in the guild ...<br />
<br />
I expect most &quot;good&quot; guilds will prioritise it based mostly on raid attendance. Given the grinding factor involved and the short amount of time to complete it before Cataclysm comes out any guild not taking serious account of attendance is going to find it very hard to finish their first Shadowmourne.<br />
<br />
The last thing you want is a large guild grinding effort wasted because some guy who only shows up to half the raids happened to have the most DKP the day you decided who got the first part of the legendary.</div></div><hr />

AMS first one<br />
<br />
Frost aura + mastery second<br />
<br />
Icebound + army the third or ams again- i use this to survive a heroic twins blast when ams is down<br />
<br />
<br />
or you can just wear frost resist for one fight</div></div><hr />

im betting theres going to be a block for paladins so we cant DS and absorb the damage and still get imbuement.<br />
<br />
divine protection is possible though, hell i'll just tank the fight and pop SE during the breath phase... lol. (prot is my offspec)</div></div><hr />

Macro a one-hander and shield, pop Shield Wall, switch back to Shadow's Edge and eat the breath.<br />
<br />
Other CDs like Guardian Spirit will be available also, or the aforementioned resist gear. I vendored all mine so it'll suck having to craft it again just for one part of the quest, though.<br />
<br />
In halls of reflection, we are told that someone has to be the next lich king or else the scourge will run wild without a leader.<br />
<br />
So now, chances are the next lich king is....The helm is what gives the LK control of the Scourge, and the point was that someone would have to wear it and maintain control of them or else they'd run loose and destroy Azeroth (it was hinted that Arthas might have subconsciously prevented the Scourge from destroying everything even though it was within the LK's ability to do so). So for lore purposes we'll get someone like Tirion Fordring or Mograine wearing the helm to subdue the Scourge.</div></div><hr />

If by &quot;already been covered&quot; you mean that it was mentioned in the video about the damage values being placeholders mere seconds before Chaos Bane was triggered, then yes, yes it was.</div></div><hr />

does this mean IC will become unlocked 1 boss every week, like TOC? or will it be a full batch, like ulduar..?<br />

first you have to get 25 saronite things. then you can do the quest ..you can get shadow's edge but from now it's not even sure if you can upgrade to shadowmourne cuz you need to get 60 shards first ...and if those shards have the same crappy dropchance like the shards in ulduar had, you're pretty fucked, arent you?</div></div><hr />

You're right, much more reasonable a legendary require two 3% boss drops.<br />
<br />
People complaining that legendaries are too hard to acquire now? In the last tier of WLK?</div></div><hr />

And likewise is the rest of the chain (the infusions) on Normal on Heroic? Or has this not yet been specified yet and it'll be a big guessing game until the bosses are unlocked?</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, I had to register to comment @ this post, you are REDICULOUS and obviously have never played a plate class, and if you did.. well I wouldnt admit if you did..<br />
<br />
MOST 2 handed weapons in WOTLK are incredibly hard to get, you either have to do TOTGC25, or finish Ulduar on hard modes, to even get a remote chance at getting a capable 2 hander *capable* not the trashy axe you get from TOC. The only decent 2 hander is from Ulduar Flame Leviathon(ironsoul), that is fairly achievable through a pug, even the regular Justicebringer is so rare, its crazy, have been slaying TOTC25 for the past 3 or 4 months weekly and have not seen it once.<br />
<br />
When I saw the new loot lists, I felt a great sense of relief at the fact they have finally included some 2 handers, not just 1 or 2 (found only after beating HEROIC final boss of instance x).. <br />
<br />
At one point, there were more Ironsoul's going around, it was gross, every plate class had ironsoul (which screams laziness at the developer), now everyone has the Edge of Ruin, I use a goddamn hunters weapon(archon glaive), because there is no attainable +str 2 handers and I HATE edge of ruin, would gladly swap it out, but for obvious reasons, you cannot equip what does not drop.</div></div><hr />
