<br />
<br />
Profession Leveling in Battle for Azeroth<br />
In Battle for Azeroth, some major changes are coming to the way we level professions. <br />
<br />
<br />
Each profession will now be separated into expansions and leveled separately from one another. <br />
Each expansion will have it's own leveling path for items from that expansion, similar to the Mists of Pandaria cooking ways. <br />
You can choose to go back and level older expansion crafting, or you can simply level the current expansion. <br />
This allows you to craft items with current expansion materials without needing older expansion materials to level<br />
You can still go back and level older expansion crafting skills as well. <br />
To clarify further, an example of this means that you can level your &quot;Cataclysm Tailoring&quot; by crafting Cataclysm patterns, but this doesn't stop you from progressing your &quot;Kul Tiran / Zandalari Tailoring&quot; from with the new expansion's patterns.<br />
First Aid is going away (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7414-Armory-Stats-First-Aid-Court-of-Stars-22-Solo-New-Overwatch-Hero-BfA-CE-Listing) and its patterns are being redistributed into Tailoring and Alchemy. Your First Aid crafts will have to be relearned in their respective new profession.<br />
<br />
<br />
In BfA will we have to relearn crafts from previous expansions?<br />
In Battle for Azeroth, any crafts you’ve learned in the past will still be there and not need to be re-learned, with the exception of First Aid. Tailoring and Alchemy crafts, bandages, and anti-venoms that used to be in First Aid will have to be re-learned.(WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/976599336325754880))<br />

Season 6 Elite Ensembles<br />
I even dare assume a lot of people from this thread would be pretty pissed if they don't release it by next week or so<br />
<br />
I have faith that since they promised it will get it done either this week or next week but we will see.<br />
<br />
This is kinda why we don't like to promise or say when to expect something like this. :/ Its easy to assume that, but this would be most likely be separate from the usual end of season rewards. Just to set the proper expectation I wouldn't expect this in the next week or two. <br />
<br />
If something does change though I will update you guys (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1087794-season-6-elite-ensembles/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20761988466?page=53#1045))<br />

Thanks Blizz fun ruined :(<br />
<br />
I like not having to use a pet but it's going to be forced utilized for the bloodlust, Rapid Fire looks shit I'm not gonna lie its a shit ability it looks terrible and pets have had their abilities pretty much stripped from them why would you want to use them except for one off abilities like BL?<br />
<br />
Also not gonna lie you can tell this guy doesnt play a hunter, I'm sad I loved the current feel of MM hunter Yeah sure Vuln was abit clunky but it had a small amount of charm even or aOE looks gutted unless we take specific talents for it... fk me sad days :(</div></div><hr />

Have you actually played the alpha? Because BfA Survival isn't 60% melee. It's about 10%. Baseline, the only spell that requires melee is raptor strike, and the only extra button that requires melee is a crap talent.</div></div><hr />

So the only ability which requires melee is your main damage-dealing resource spender, and then, of course, there's auto-attack. Any time spent outside of melee as a BfA SV hunter is a dps loss, and Aspect of the Eagle is only there to mitigate, not eliminate, this drop-off.</div></div><hr />

True that! Who have already made hunter before &quot;the new SV&quot; they didn't want to make a melee character. Duhhh. <br />
Survival hunter is the most complicated spec in the game right now I mean to do top damage by the logs it is insane how hard. <br />
And if you have a bad tank... ohhh boy! This spec is basically based on your tank who he moves the adds, boss. In M+ you need to consant talking to each other.<br />
<br />
And this new BfA SV hunter is just a joke every raid mechanic is based on ranged, melee, tank, healer. There are no hybrid specs. So SV will be the last dps anyway becuase you will get both scripts from the bosses and you can even fuck up others by moving in or out from melee.<br />
<br />
Just no!<br />
<br />
And those who say there are lots of people who enjoy this class: Just STFU! This shit says all. There is no place for SV hunter in this game.<br />

Couldn't agree more. Ion said in his q&amp;a he wished people would stop trying to talk for everyone else. Too many people in this thread have said &quot;no one wanted survival, no one likes survival&quot; which is so not true.<br />
<br />
I like survival, I want a melee hunter. I like the class fantasy of a survivalist who uses any of his tools to track and defeat his prey be it a crossbow or a spear.<br />
<br />
I like and play legion survival its just really clunky and too many spells to manage which have no real link to each other.<br />
<br />
BFA survival looks fantastic. I wish Survival Instincs was still in there are the idea of disengaging and then harpooning back in sounded really fun and cool; eagerly looming forward to what talents fills that spot instead though.<br />
<br />
I am definitely going to main a BFA survival hunter though so I want it and cant wait.</div></div><hr />

Ion said in his q&amp;a he wished people would stop trying to talk for everyone else. Too many people in this thread have said &quot;no one wanted survival, no one likes survival&quot; which is so not true.<br />
<br />
I like survival, I want a melee hunter. I like the class fantasy of a survivalist who uses any of his tools to track and defeat his prey be it a crossbow or a spear.<br />
<br />
I like and play legion survival its just really clunky and too many spells to manage which have no real link to each other.<br />
<br />
BFA survival looks fantastic. I wish Survival Instincs was still in there are the idea of disengaging and then harpooning back in sounded really fun and cool; eagerly looming forward to what talents fills that spot instead though.<br />
<br />
I am definitely going to main a BFA survival hunter though so I want it and cant wait.<br />
<br />
This, clunky as F but fun.</div></div><hr />

The pure DPS classes do not need new ways to stay pure DPS. They need ways to fill another role so that there are MORE tanks, MORE healers, and SHORTER queues for everybody. Druid can perform every role in the GD game, and every single new class introduced since vanilla has been a hybrid, but hunters mages rogues and warlocks can just stay stuck in their single role, I guess? Whatever.<br />
<br />
Also, please GTFO with this &quot;nuh uh DONT TALK FOR ME&quot; BS. Nobody on the hunter threads asked for a survival melee spec. There were multi-hundred page suggestion/review threads for every expansion, and I literally did not see that request even once on any major thread. It's an almost irrelevantly small percentage of the hunter population, and for the rest of us who mained hunter since vanilla? We basically became a 2-spec class.<br />
<br />
Please stop. It's silly and stupid.</div></div><hr />
