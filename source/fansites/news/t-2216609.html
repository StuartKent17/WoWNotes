<br />
Being fair, if it was left as is, the legendary ring would become op in blizzards eyes and would be gutted like the helm was. Not saying the current set bonus is better, but as someone that only just got the ring this afternoon, I'd rather not see our best legendary nerfed for a stupid reason like before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But making t19 sets worse does not make the completely underwhelming t20 sets better. THAT is and has been the problem from the start.<br />
<br />
From what I've seen most classes are saying the t20 sets are a total miss on blizzards part. I can't help but feel this is only a response to that negative criticism instead of blizzard being concerned about balance, which is a convenient excuse.</div></div><hr />

Ehm... did you notice the price? 15.000 for one of those? No thanks i prefer to run :P<br />

Edit: Since the legendary rings grant a passive talent. I suspect that the Shadow will be Fortress of the Mind 80% or Void Ray 20%.</div></div><hr />

That's the resell value, probably will cost more. And considering inflation, I'd say worth it!</div></div><hr />

With that I mean only Questing or going to a Zone on the other continent, where you may also need another map.<br />
1. Spamming Dungeons is generally faster as a Tank/Healer leaving your capital after getting to 15 is pointless<br />
2. even then, things are alreay resonably well connected<br />
recently leveled a BE Rogue, went: Starting Zones &gt; UC, Zep Grom'gol &gt; portal to Plaquelands from BB &gt; free flight towards Badlands &gt; Searing Gorge &gt; Mageportal/Quest in northern Burning Steppes to the Swamp of Sorrows &gt; Blasted Lands &gt; TBC stuff<br />
the only times a new fligthpoint would have helped is when you go towards the area for the first time, which was only really annoying for Tristessa and the Searing Gorge but I used autowalk and stuffed my face with cookies<br />
3.You'd get the Maps last since the other stuff probably helps you more (armor 3,5k weapon 6,7k), so you cannot quest &quot;properly&quot; since you get ~50% more exp.<br />
<br />
I was hoping for Heirloom Gauntlets and Boots so you can complete the look. <br />
Being able to upgrade up to 110 is also only really an issue directly after starting Legion where new Items have like 5 times the stats. The Bonusxp is still nice though. I just hope the Armor upgrade wont be too expensive. Upgrading your Weapon is still early though .</div></div><hr />

the t20 sets are not even done yet, they are still placeholders for the most part. lets wait and see what happens to them before we bring out the pitchforks. some classes have good t20 sets now (spriest is much better than the one before)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same. Been asking for account-wide flight path maps for years. Although, I figured they would make them an Inscription craftable scroll you would consume or maybe even an engineering &quot;GPS&quot; style device you use once, instead of whatever it is they are doing here. Still, it's a welcome addition for those of us who are alt-happy. <br />
<br />
But I hope the 15k price is a placeholder and not legit, because that's absurd. As they have it, it's 60k to unlock on both alliance and horde, and that's just for Azeroth. It doesn't include Outland, Northrend, Vashj'ir/Deepholm, Pandaria, or Draenor.</div></div><hr />

I'd assume they will be obtained via the current RNG system, which just makes it worse.</div></div><hr />

You pick another talent from the tree and have 2 talents in that tier. It just adds another layer of how your character can preform, the synergy with certain set bonuses + other talent/skills will be interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yet its going to be 6 months of hoping on RNG and if u don't get that BIS u get benched or have to reroll. its a bad idea and should never come to wow. wow is a MMO not a bloody hack and slash.</div></div><hr />

Meh, not a huge deal. If a guild is going to bench somebody for not having a Legendary they better be a top 10 guild and it better be a specific fight, if not then it's just a bunch of tools running it. Either way I'm really enjoying the legendary system this expansion, really hope they carry over aspects of it into the next :D<br />
<br />
RNG has always been a huge factor of WoW regardless, Warglaives are a prime example of that (along with my damn TOEP from MC! Literally went through to AQ where it was fully replaceable till it dropped).</div></div><hr />

Ehm... did you notice the price? 15.000 for one of those? No thanks i prefer to run :P<br />
<br />
Edit: Since the legendary rings grant a passive talent. I suspect that the Shadow will be Fortress of the Mind 80% or Void Ray 20%.<br />

1. Do you have a source for this? People claimed this was coming with 7.2 and for something you say is coming in only 4 weeks. There has been no evidence it is...<br />
<br />
Also legendaries have always been massive amounts of RNG. These legendaries are just like sulfur as and the bow. and the glaives.</div></div><hr />

took 5 secs of google. Blizzard never said when it comes coming in 7.2.<br />

And it would be rely bad to give a 4th relic slot mid nighthold. it would make that raid into a joke while its the main raid people are pushing.</div></div><hr />

With that I mean only Questing or going to a Zone on the other continent, where you may also need another map.<br />
1. Spamming Dungeons is generally faster as a Tank/Healer leaving your capital after getting to 15 is pointless<br />
2. even then, things are alreay resonably well connected<br />
recently leveled a BE Rogue, went: Starting Zones &gt; UC, Zep Grom'gol &gt; portal to Plaquelands from BB &gt; free flight towards Badlands &gt; Searing Gorge &gt; Mageportal/Quest in northern Burning Steppes to the Swamp of Sorrows &gt; Blasted Lands &gt; TBC stuff<br />
the only times a new fligthpoint would have helped is when you go towards the area for the first time, which was only really annoying for Tristessa and the Searing Gorge but I used autowalk and stuffed my face with cookies<br />
3.You'd get the Maps last since the other stuff probably helps you more (armor 3,5k weapon 6,7k), so you cannot quest &quot;properly&quot; since you get ~50% more exp.<br />
<br />
I was hoping for Heirloom Gauntlets and Boots so you can complete the look. <br />
Being able to upgrade up to 110 is also only really an issue directly after starting Legion where new Items have like 5 times the stats. The Bonusxp is still nice though. I just hope the Armor upgrade wont be too expensive. Upgrading your Weapon is still early though .<br />
<br />
I really hope they add new heirloom pieces</div></div><hr />

I'm fine with been wrong about something, even though again its done though twitter rather then the WOW forums. But trying to be a ass there does not help you, and even if that is true, how many times do these mods have type off's! again after ur little gif only shows ur been a child.<br />
<br />
But I guess that's normal for MMO Champ now is it? troll hard...<br />
<br />
And after looking at the traits, the ranks go up to 8, yet there are only 4 traits, and 3 relics that is 7 if u fully max every thing, yet there is 8 ranks. You try hard yet it shows they had planned to go with a 4th slot.</div></div><hr />

A. because very few people took the blue post serious because it was &quot;these are the things we went over at blizzcon to do with artifacts&quot; and for some reason 1 thing was missing, with another thing in its place, basically confirming it was wrong so very few people took it as true.<br />
B. again a random wow forum off topic post that is not even its own thread or its own main page post prob has the same level of seriousness as his twitter post.<br />
C. i mean your being an ass aswell with the &quot;took 5 seconds of google searching&quot; <br />
D. Type offs? do you mean Type o's ? i dont think anyone took them quite as serious as this not even a typo, a right out miscommunication<br />

And after looking at the traits, the ranks go up to 8, yet there are only 4 traits, and 3 relics that is 7 if u fully max every thing, yet there is 8 ranks.

People worked for them? Most of the old ones relied on a rare raid drop, followed by some gold drop. Not really a skillful personal effort, more like luck to me. MoP and WoD legendaries just took a long time, an improvement though.</div></div><hr />

the bonuses themselfs where good enough that the ilvl 925 would beat out higher ilvl gear, yes they took the lazy mans way out. but i think they should just make the t20 pieces much stronger than their t19 counterparts so people who have bis legendaries in set pieces dont get such a clusterfuck</div></div><hr />

Where would we get upgrades from? No where because every single slot is allready BiS and the only thing that could still get better would be our tier pieces. Do people actually think before suggesting stuff?</div></div><hr />

You say that like it's a lot. We're talking the equivalent of $3 real money (if you buy tokens), or maybe 20 minutes crafting and posting in AH.</div></div><hr />

No thanks i prefer to run :PThe price of a cheap mount on the AH, considering you only have to buy it once for all characters to have all flightpaths for basically eternity, i think 15,000 isn't really very steep. I mean when you consider getting enough heirlooms for a chauffeur costs easily 3 times that.<br />
<br />
That said maybe that's just because I can pay 25 dollars to get almost 100k gold and am therefore, able to justify this shit a lot easier? lmao<br />

wow tokens let me be a filthy casual forever</div></div><hr />
