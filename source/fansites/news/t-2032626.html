This will be his SECOND full Xpac. He is currently the first main enemy that we have tried to kill for 2 full X packs in a row, that alone makes him big in the games story. <br />
<br />
Spoiler Below<br />
All of our major leaders are going to DIE.. because of HIM, Wrynn , Tirion, Vol'jin, Thrall nearly dies, the countless acts of destruction to our world, what do you mean leave little impact? <br />

its not is second full expan he didn't really matter in wod until hfc he was there but didn't really amount to much and its not like hes malygoes in wrath or lady vash in tbc he his past doesn't really matter as it hasn't effect our world out gul'dan had huge impacts on our outland and azeroth where this gul'dan is gonna res illidan then kick the bucket most likely it it could be any other random warlock and you would get the same effect.</div></div><hr />

You understand original Gul'dan is dead since long ago when he oppened the tomb of sargeras, right ? Illidan even consumed his skull.<br />
<br />
The real threat is AU Gul'dan. The one from unexploded Draenor, the one from this video, the one we will fight in Legion.</div></div><hr />

While the rest of the Horde was distracted fighting the Alliance back during the end of the second war, Gul'dan and Cho'gall took both of their clans, along with a bunch of other orcs on a mission to find the Tomb of Sargeras, which Gul'dan believed contained the power of Sargeras himself, which he intended to steal. Gul'dan raised the islands from the seafloor and entered the tomb, only to be ambushed by demons. He slowly bled to death alone in the dark.<br />
<br />
The rest of his forces were killed by the Blackrock clan who followed them to the broken isles. Cho'gall escaped and fled to Ahn'qiraj.</div></div><hr />

Which is why this is all so stupid. So you mean to tell me the Legion was able to empower a piece of crap cripple more than the Guldan WE knew who was ambitious, powerful with magic, and was already a bad ass?<br />
<br />
Bad story as usual from Blizzard.<br />

<br />
Can we please stop this stupid ass claim?<br />
<br />
HE DID NOT SUMMON ARCHIMONDE.<br />
<br />
Learn to read the quests you do in Tanaan for once. Guldan used the residual energies from the Dark Portal to open a portal to the nether. He basically redirected a massive amount of existing power and it took him a very long time. He didn't summon shit and it wasn't his power(well a fraction was since the portal drained him and his flunkies, but also had used the hourglass).</div></div><hr />

<br />
....for this comment and this story to impress you, I'm not sure you are sincere about the first part of that. This is a pretty traditional villain story, mind you I enjoy it, but it is pretty much one of the most typical villain origins of all time. But it was ultra enjoyable, as I love good tradition, and the art is fun as always.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm also surprised as to why they changed it, but I guess it's a bit more captivating than just a normal grab for power. Sure, it changes the backstory a bit, but I think it's a bit better to show some reason why he lusts for power. This was just a normal character development to show you the reasons as to why he is the way he is.<br />
<br />
Would everyone really be happy with a story in terms of &quot;He was an apprentice. Wanted to be a master shaman so he took a quick route.&quot;? That's a bit boring and bland story.<br />
<br />
Considering why he's so different than MU Gul'dan is because he said in the campaign quests he tortured some of our prisoners and learned about the MU Gul'dan. What happened, what he did and how he ended. That alone gives him knowledge and reason to change his future and not fully follow in footsteps of MU Gul'dan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gul'dan here, the underdog, a cripple with no place, TRYING to fit in with his clan in trying to be a shaman only to be rejected by the elements as well for seeing the evil that's just in his soul to begin with. It wasn't that he became evil, he just is in his heart and this shows it. <br />
<br />
He always had great potential and his old master knew it, he just never knew it would be for him to be a powerful warlock. Gul'dan being great, but a great evil. I love that ^_^</div></div><hr />

The animation style is based off the very well received Burdens of Shaohao shorts that they made during Mists of Pandaria. If you don't like that art style, that's fine, that's your opinion and you are entitled to it. However, that does not mean if someone has a differing opinion about the art style that they are dumb or a Blizzard apologist, it's just their opinion and that's fine too. You need to not be so angry and understand that people have different opinions, and yours isn't the definitive one.</div></div><hr />

Not everything needs to be fully animated. The quality is amazing, the effects, shots, themes, and VO are all solid. <br />
<br />
This is a stylized means to distribute the content with much more focus on the individual SHOT and emphasis on motion ONLY when it is important and relevant. The motion and movement of the figures in the shot isn't important and allows for strong emphasis on the themes they're trying to convey.<br />
<br />
Does it save them money? Sure, but that saved money, time, and effort also allows them to release MORE content for us to view for FREE. <br />
<br />
It's a great story with great content. Why does everyone have to be a friggin' critic? Just enjoy it for what it is.</div></div><hr />

I despise the fact the Legion starts off with the accessory to time criminal Garrosh - who violated the timeline law - we - the time cops - werent able to catch at the end of the last expansion with the worst story, content patch, initial content ever produced for this game. The senseless time cop story of wod was the worst thing and now the timeline criminal guildan is back in the present. Well, at least the orcs and draenei are at peace with each other in Draenor because after the orcs butchered them under the command of Hellscream - the nice guy from the start who wanted our heads - decides to help at the end when he has absolutely no other choice. And that story continues with the time criminals into Legion. Nice stuff.I liked Guldan from warcraft lore but now i never want to see him again. I hope his story and the tie to WoD die instantly in Legion.<br />

Ner'zhul may not have existed in the same capacity in the AU. If I remember, they specifically picked that AU for garrosh to go to because baby garrosh was never born or some weird nonsensical thing.

And honestly would not call this a minor change when he wasn´t the apprentice of Ner´zhul here. But then I would wish they had made more references to the knowledge they had during wod as well - why on earth would they be so ignorant to some things, but seem to &quot;recognize&quot; stuff elsewhere. Way too random, and not properly set up.</div></div><hr />

Lords of War was also great. The art is fantastic and they manage to make it epic and 'alive' even though its just still pictures<br />
Completely agree. Great work.<br />
<br />
If only the actual game felt like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Subtitles are important for me (I'm profoundly deaf which means that i can't actually hear anything what all the guys in the video are saying.) and other deaf WoW community to follow the lore. <br />
<br />
What a disappointment from blizzard. :(:(:(<br />
<br />
Why should Blizzard add subtitles for you.<br />
Blizzard don't care your problem, we don't care your problem! Go away!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Somehow, AU Gul'dan has a totally different backstory from our Gul'dan, but ended up in the exact same place playing the exact same role when we went back in time to stop them from drinking the Legion's blood.<br />
<br />
And by the way, is this any different from the intros they did for the Warlords? I remember Kilrogg's, it was basically &quot;Ogres are mean, I fight back because I'm badass and start a new clan.&quot; If they're going to gut Gul'Dan's story at least come up with something original.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Ner'zhul may not have existed in the same capacity in the AU. If I remember, they specifically picked that AU for garrosh to go to because baby garrosh was never born or some weird nonsensical thing. So not everything happens in the same way as the MU is all I'm saying, it's an open book of what they can mess with at this point.<br />
<br />
But it gets ever more nonsensical the more they mess with it. Original Gul'Dan's backstory was fine, why fuck it up?</div></div><hr />
