Drinking blood doesn't make orc go green all of a sudden. The green skin is a slow process of corruption, not directly from drinking blood, but from Fel magic influence. The green hue in the image is due to lighting. The cinematic will mostlikely cover the story before 6.0.1, and since we know Grom is brown ingame, there's no reason he would turn green in the cinematic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe during the course of wod he drinks the blood nevertheless? what would make him do that?<br />
<br />
also:<br />
why do all the warlords and other major characters look awesome in their simple yet stylized armor but we as players always have to wear something over the top?</div></div><hr />

People like you piss me off. Wimper wimper wimper, Mists sucked, Wod will suck, Wow sucks, bring back BC wimper wimper wimper. get over it. Blizzard does an amazing job every expac, it may not be your fav but they have done nothing short of creative master pieces. Warcraft is number 1 for a reason. Even if they drop in subs, its still number 1, great game play, great story, great team. Suck a goat. Blizzard rules all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buffbringer</div><div class="date">2014-08-13, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Drinking the blood immediately turned Grom and his clan red. It was a well that Mannoroth made called the Chaos Well. They became known as Chaos Orcs upon doing so. But yeah it's some form of lighting. Same happened with gul'dan in the WoDs banner. people going &quot;oh he is green skinned&quot; no he isn't. He is grey skinned with a green ball of energy in his hand, the light is turning him green.<br />
<br />
That was in Reign of Chaos, and my guess is that they turned red immediately because they were already green skinned (corrupted, in a way)... but in the books, when they first drink it in Draenor, they describe the green skin as some kind of disease, and it happens slowly, even to those who didn't drink the blood (like Doomhammer and Durotan). Plus, their eyes turned red.<br />
<br />
And people saying his skin is green in the picture, i think that's just some light effect, reflecting on his brown skin.</div></div><hr />

You are either trolling or sadly misinformed. At Blizzcon Dave Kosak said &quot;Gul'dan drank the kool-aid, his skin is green, he's all in&quot; LOL yet you turn around and say drinking the blood doesn't make your skin green? &quot;The Adventure continues- Blizzcon 2013 panel&quot; - look it up and educate yourself.</div></div><hr />

Which he still does. Compare with Metzen's work (http://image.blizzgame.ru/assets/GalleryPhoto/1/_resampled/SetWidth850-Grom-Hellscream-by-Chris-Metzen.jpg). Nostrils cover the ring more than in Blizzard's recent work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
....Wow you're just so terrible misinformed it's almost funny. They've SAID he drank the kool-aid. They SAID he's on the phone with Kil'Jaeden. He's green because he's green. It's not a green ball of energy turning him green. Christ... Just stop talking.</div></div><hr />

The green skin is a slow process of corruption, not directly from drinking blood, but from Fel magic influence. The green hue in the image is due to lighting. The cinematic will mostlikely cover the story before 6.0.1, and since we know Grom is brown ingame, there's no reason he would turn green in the cinematic.<br />
Actually, drinking Manoroth's Blood made them go almost instantly deep green like the Orcs from the RTS games. The Orcs that didn't drink the blood but who were recipients of 2nd hand Fel Energy from the Locks, slowly turned as they notice they were getting a greenish hue over time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gul’dan barely had time to take the chalice from Grom before the other orc stiffened and shuddered. He doubled over for a moment, and the crowd murmured in worry. Durotan stared, horrified, as Grom’s hunched-over body pulsated and quivered. Before his eyes, Grom’s shoulders, slender for an orc’s, broadened. His armor creaked as it settled over this newly powerful body. Slowly, Grom straightened. Tall as ever he had been, reshaped by the green liquid to be stronger and thickly muscled, he looked out over the crowd.<br />
What Durotan could see of his face was smooth and healthy and, save for the tattooed jaw … completely green.<br />
<br />
..Also, I was a little sad that Grom looks a little...well, piggish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i agree its the lighting in the picture and actually the corruption process is rather quick it does make them green almost instantly read the Guldan and the stranger comic Guldan goes from brown orc to hulk green in a few frames after drinking mannoroths blood and in Warcraft 3 when Grom and his clan became Chaos Orcs to kill cenarius by drinking from mannoroths corrupted well in ashenvale they turned red skinned and increased in size practically instantly that demon blood is powerful stuff</div></div><hr />

<br />
1/ This is a younger Grom, long before he ever had the character growth to become the 'redeemed hero' (which is debatable anyway).<br />
2/ This is an alternate timeline with differing events leading up to the opening of the Dark Portal.<br />
3/ Its not even confirmed that he's the 'bad guy' - he's just a brutal warmonger who happens to be fighting against the interests of the player factions. Things may change.<br />
4/ Stop complaining about everything.</div></div><hr />
