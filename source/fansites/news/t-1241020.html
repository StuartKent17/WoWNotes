<br />
I'm actually somewhat dubious that they'll have another full-fledged daily grind rep... I'm fairly certain that they'll have a raid rep, but with the work involved in making a daily quest grind (especially if they're going to write a story around it,) players continued... quibbling... about them, and the necessary set up, they might forgo it. <br />
<br />
At any rate, hopefully we'll see Chen at some point.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc653b863d86</div><div class="date">2012-12-21, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wtf does that even mean?<br />
<br />
I will translate his meaning for you:<br />
<br />
&quot;The previously announced patch (5.2) would have been enjoyable to play during the Christmas holidays, when people with full time jobs would have had an opportunity to fully play it. However, Blizzard has seen fit to decide to release it after the holidays, when employed people are going to be working full time again. On the other hand, unemployed people who are not actively contributing to society, or students who have a lot more spare time, will be able to fully enjoy such content&quot;.<br />
<br />
Not that I agree, since this thing on LFR will be probably split into 1 to 3 raids of 4 bosses each, each with a maximum time commitment of about 45 minutes a week. <br />
<br />
Also, I do not agree, since in the holiday period you shouldn't really be wasting time on this stuff and just going out to get Pi**ed out of your head and have a good time instead of being at home and playing games... but that is just me...</div></div><hr />

Oh, and for those saying it looks exactly like Ulduar - it looks like a castle. Of course it will look similar on the outside. What matters is what it looks like inside, and the bosses inside.</div></div><hr />

Well I kinda skipped over a vast majority of those quests and moved on once I dinged so I might have to go back and do them to see what I missed.<br />
<br />
I am really hoping it turns out to be a Ulduar-esque raid, I loved the open-ness of it and how huge it felt.<br />
<br />
<br />
But when Blizzard add us new raid(s) and new dungeons and new tier??? :p<br />

Umm.... Yes? I think. If you asking if they are going to add all that then that's a 99% likeliness.</div></div><hr />

Dave Kosak talked about this some when Mists of Pandaria first came out, actually.<br />
<br />
They've basically made changes to the way their teams are structured and have created a more strategic development process, in order to develop content more efficiently than in the past. Basically, they're doing things to optimize and layer development so that everything runs more smoothly and development time and man hours are being managed better. Plus, their staff members become more and more capable of developing content more quickly as they've gained more experience.<br />
<br />
For example, the teams are now divided somewhat, producing different sets of content simultaneously. So while 5.1 has only just been released, other teams have already been working on 5.2 since the expansion was released, if not before that. And, most likely, some of the teams are already working on content for 5.3, even though 5.2 hasn't even gone into public testing yet. And, of course, their conceptual artists, cdev, and their cinematics department have almost certainly already started work on the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

im sure there will be more dailys, but say what, like about 10 max? lol .. not really a life-breaking issue<br />
<br />
in other news, hopefully it will be more like ulduar, in that the 'hardmodes/heroics' are triggered by doing or not doing stuff rather than the standard 'on/off' thing we now have.. that and hopefully its as big/open/glorious as ulduar was too, defo one of the best raids out there, imo :)</div></div><hr />

Well early january it said PTR 5.2? so i'd say at the earliest March and at the latest May, so around march/may before u even see 5.2 so u have around 3,5 months still to clear tier 14, however I could be wrong but normally I thought a PTR patch especially when it contains a raid stays on the PTR anywhere from 3,4 months.</div></div><hr />

You skipped the Kun-lai quests didn't you? The trolls come invading pandaria, recover the Thunder King's body and ress him. He's one of the few, if not the only mogu on the whole quest chain....</div></div><hr />

Everyone wants it to be like Ulduar. And you think just because you (1 person out of 82916492604 ) doesn't want it to be like Ulduar it means it won't? Lol ok...<br />
<br />
It's funny how your opinion would change if Ulduar was current content.<br />
<br />
While it has one of the best bosses, Mimiron, it also has the worst boss ever, flame leviathan. The first 4 were in fact terrible, and just a grind as all you wanted were the last few bosses on hardmode. The next 3, were again easy and just boring. The keepers, 2 of them crap, 2 of them great. The general was a boring fight again, Yogg was cool, but very very easy, the only hard part about it was having high dps, everything else in the fight was easy to avoid and manage, dps was the only issue. Algalon looked very cool, possibly the best entrance into a fight, but this quickly wears off.<br />
<br />
At the time Ulduar was out, after a month, people complained how boring it was, this was how the whole of wrath was basically.<br />
<br />
Ulduar did have cool hardmodes though, instead of the flick a switch to heroic, this is probably why most of you look back with fond memories. That and wrath babies.</div></div><hr />

This, This so much. Flame Leviathan was the worst dump of a boss this game has ever had. Literally, every week, getting 25 people into their vehicles according to their gearscore to ensure they had the most hp possible for the various ways we were doing that boss. The length of time it took to get to him. Oh man it was awful.</div></div><hr />

1) Why people talkin' Trolls?<br />
If you complete the Kun Lai quests, the Trolls are the ones who resurrect the Thunder King. The theory is that the entire dungeon/raid tier takes place on the remains of Zandalar Island (the empty spot on the Townlong Steppes map).<br />
2) What about new quests from the events in Krasarang Wilds?<br />
My guess is that the &quot;sequel&quot; to 5.1 will be 5.3 (leading into the Siege of Orgrimmar 5.4 raid tier). While there will be some reference to it (and Vol'jin will likely be prominently involved as a leader in the 5.2 raid), it'll be in the context of the raid tier. May not even have a new set of dailies for us!<br />
3) ... and Wrathion?<br />
Oh I'm sure he'll reward you for killing the Thunder King with an upgrade or something<br />
4) Old God etc<br />
The Seven Sha are the remains from the death of an Old God. We dealt with 6 of them in 5.0. The last one, the Sha of Narrative Convenience, will likely be &quot;exposed&quot; in 5.3 and defeated in 5.4. RIP Gamon<br />
5) How long to test?<br />
My guess is that 5.2 is simply a dungeon and raid tier. Three or four dungeons and a raid with 12+ bosses. So the length to test shouldn't be significant. Of course, if my guess is wrong, who knows.</div></div><hr />

There will be no new 5 mans like it was in Cata and the old expansions where you did catch up with ur gear true new 5 mans. After t15 releases people will still be doing t14 (expecting it to be a bit nerfed thou) to get gear for t15. Instead of new 5 mans to catch up blizz introduced the upgrade system and wont allow t15 items to be upgraded till t16 comes out.</div></div><hr />

It'll likely be a combination of both, given the Zandalari were responsible for resurrecting the Thunder King to begin with. 5.2 may come with a ZG/ZA type 5-man dungeon to boot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By looking the raid from the outside, it does strongly resemble Ulduar. Hopefully it will deliver. And the place where the raid is going to be is on that large island above Townlong Steppes.<br />
<br />
See the island all the way north west:<br />

That island currently has the large Mogu palace in Vale of Eternal Blossom, but it seems it'll get updated in that picture.</div></div><hr />

why? you could 2man 25man Flame levi even in the current gear at the time. It hardly mattered what your gearscore was anyway, it was only 2-3 people in demos killing him anyway. even on hardmode (lol) it was easy. And it was pretty optional sending people up top.<br />
<br />
Was a fun fight, not overly hard but differnt and a nice entry to the raid.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2012-12-21, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This timeline is indeed surprising... though they did say they had two separate teams working on 5.1 and 5.2 simultaneously. <br />
<br />
I'm actually somewhat dubious that they'll have another full-fledged daily grind rep... I'm fairly certain that they'll have a raid rep, but with the work involved in making a daily quest grind (especially if they're going to write a story around it,) players continued... quibbling... about them, and the necessary set up, they might forgo it. <br />
<br />
At any rate, hopefully we'll see Chen at some point.<br />
<br />
Mainly raiders complained about rep grinds, most non-raiders enjoy having a deep story played out like the new reps from 5.1. Remember, if you aren´t a raider, what are you doing? I think there will be, and should be a faction hub with every patch in order to tell the story better. The devs clearly have learned how to do this well. The only real problem with rep ´grinds´ was that in 5.0, Golden Lotus was pretty mandatory and had some of the least fun quests (and most annoying quests). If GL had been more like Domination, a lot less people would have complained. But having quests in a small area with mob tag issues, and then other badly designed ones like with the sprites.. just made it not fun. Does anyone really complain about doing AC-white tiger quests? It was all about GL.</div></div><hr />

Shado-Pan quests sucked. But that was execution (not registering you had a companion, stealth not working right, companion pulling half the island, etc), not design.<br />
<br />
GL weren't as bad but the gating to AC and SP made it nigh-mandatory and this annoying. And while I understand the original intent, how about dropping it now?)<br />
<br />
As for new dailies in 5.2, I'm not as sure we'll get some; I'd rather they focus on progression via dungeons/raids (the dungeons don't have to drop higher ilvl but they can advance the story, as well as giving those who just like to run 5-mans something new to do) and leave the next set of dailies for 5.3.</div></div><hr />

Well I didn't think they'd ignore what happened in 5.1; I'm just wondering to what extent it'll be addressed. Heck, the BElf storyline could be &quot;advanced&quot; simply via a dungeon encounter a la the Nexus along with one-time quests.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm uncomfortable with the idea that every patch brings a new faction with a daily questline to advance the narrative. I'd rather they took a patch off every now and then to allow us to concentrate on something else for a short time (and I'm not just saying this because I've barely started Operation:Shieldwall because I'm trying to get my alts and profs leveled &gt;.&gt; &lt;.&lt;)</div></div><hr />

The wow devs always have a tendency to overuse a new technology. If you recall, they had just added vehicle fights to the game. So they basically wasted a boss on it, and an entire heroic dungeon on it (Occulus). I think player feedback at the time taught them their lesson, remember they had to keep adding bonuses to Occ to get people to actually complete it if it was their random (blue drake mount).<br />

That is so true. Occulus had so many changes and bonuses added to it just to get people to stay it was borderline moronic. Players in general hated that place but cause blizzard spent so much time on it they wanted to make sure people went to (and it was still a terrible instance)<br />

You are right about how they use tech. I bet the wind/gravity effects get way over used.</div></div><hr />

Operation Shieldwall takes about 15 minutes per day, probably less if you have raid gear. For horde, there is one set that takes me literally 5 minutes to do. (shoot down 6 helicopters, kill 8 soldiers, destroy 6 crates, kill 2 captians and blow up 2 ships). I have timed it.. 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />

Announced the day before PTR goes live: &quot;WTF, they could have given us some warning! I've been raiding kinda casually until now but PTR means live soonish, now I'm going to have to bust my balls to get geared for next tier or be benched QQ BLIZZARD!&quot; <br />

From GC's twitter feed:<br />
<br />
How can we expect ilvl upgrading to affect the tuning of future raid tiers?<br />
Philosophically we want raids to be more about progression and less about instant catch up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274003101369892864))<br />
Going back to the old model where you have to progress linear through the raids from release of current expac?<br />
That's the plan. We have older Raid Finder tiers now to provide the necessary gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274016574480990209))<br />
<br />
That said, there will probably be new 5-mans. They would likely be either the same iLvl as T14 LFR or slightly lower.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raid progression gear should always have been about linear progression and not about completely skipping tiers. The system they introduced from Wrath of handing almost full sets of catchup gear caused more problems than it was worth. All that did was tell people to unsub if they didn't like the new raid or when they got bored, come back at the patch and you'll be ready to go for the next tier within a few days and get your old raid spot back. <br />
<br />
I remember one of my hunters went all in one week on every piece that he could get (including the KT 25 gun) and then the following week told us to replace him with '2 minutes before raid notice'. Ulduar was announced, and he magically reappeared opening night asking me for his spot back. Of course he had been replaced by a 100% attending player and raged in guild about how I was a disloyal and unfair GM, and I had to eventually remove him because he would do this nightly. We saw this with several others over the course of the entire expansion. Some pieces to catch up are fine, but entire sets allowing you to come and go were just ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

I can't wait, the story of wow is such a great one. I hope to at least someday see a glimpse of the stronger names in the game. I really think some people have given up on these things.

I have timed it.. 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
I have no idea the relevance of this comment. Time is a closed system (at least for me), and whether it takes 15 minutes or 5 hours, that's time from another task. I've prioritized prof leveling time, so Operation: Shieldwall must wait.<br />

Grubz: The screams from people who log in for 5.2 realizing there are no instant epics and they have to actually raid for raid gear is going to be deafening. Hmmm. Actually, that was release. <br />
<br />
<br />
Way more people complain about others getting instant epics than those who complain about not getting them.<br />
<br />
The reality is that the TBC raid model caused tons of problems. LFR fixes that problem, but as LFR didn't exist until DS, Blizz had to do something. I know it upsets those that care more about the color of the item border on the armory page, but the solution, while creating a ton of whining among the so-called &quot;elitists&quot;, helped.</div></div><hr />

There will be Trolls. A Titan something-or-other. And maybe (maybe) there will be something like Gunship/Saurfang where it turns into an Alliance vs Horde battle (it'd be nice if the &quot;Saurfang&quot; boss would actually be based on faction encountering him).<br />

Instead of new 5 mans to catch up blizz introduced the upgrade system and wont allow t15 items to be upgraded till t16 comes out.<br />
<br />
I remember Blizzard mentioning wanting people to gear up through previous LFR, but I don't remember them mentioning never adding more dungeons in. It would be easy: 3 new 5-man Heroics that drop 470 gear. That would be like 9 new bosses with a potential for maybe 7 , 8 upgrades per class, so you wouldn't even be able to get into HoF LFR just grinding them.<br />

If it bugs you so much, don't watch any news on it. When you're in a hardcore world-first guild you give up the ability to enjoy the surprises and lore because you're dedicated to being the best. But if you're not, you can easily just roll into the LFR week one without reading a strat and learning it the hard way.</div></div><hr />

Then how will they get players to test it? Don't get me wrong I would love if they did that but can't have like a handle of players across the world test this raid then have it sent out when most likely other guilds saying its either too hard or too easy then posting on their forums or here complaining...you guys know the cycle lol<br />

Why not just have them sign a NDA, like pre expansion testing? There's a million ways to test it without getting every bit of information leaked. Problem is, people would bitch nowadays about having to discover something for themselves instead of looking it up on wowhead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well unfortunately that's the problem with demanding faster content. Blizzard is doing a good job here with speed of content in comparison to Cataclysm, but it's a double edged sword because it also leaves the ones currently progressing through further behind. The best thing they can do for this though, is NOT release a dungeon pack that drops gear that makes tier 14 worthless, imo. By not doing that you still make t14 a relevant step of progression tot ake before entering t15 without bypassing the gear requirements by getting them through new dungeons as we have seen in the passed (ala ICC 5 mans, Zandelari 5 mans, Dragonsoul 5 mans, etc) New dungeons are fun, but ultimately eliminate the previous tiers in terms of progression and with raid finder I don't think they should become irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

So...because a front shot of the outside of the instance looks similar, the entire raid is a complete rehash and therefore garbage?

all that means is your opinion and those that agree with you happen to be in the vast minority. if one was to spend any reasonable time here on these boards, it would be plainly obvious how ulduar in particular was held up as one of the best raids. nostalgia or not, there has been numerous requests from the majority of the raiding community to go back to that style of raid.</div></div><hr />

It was the best raid !!!! Blizz makes Ulduar inspired raid. Players scream ... Noo that is all wrong, it reminds us of Ulduar !!! <br />

Can't please them all I guess :) I am one of those who wouldn't mind raiding another Ulduar, so looks nice to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Zone in, go forward for a couple hundred yards, encounter Marrowgar/Leviathan. <br />
<br />
Turn left, encounter Ignis/Putricide. Turn right and encounter Razorscale/Sindragosa. Go straight and encounter XT/Lanathel.<br />
<br />
Click the portal, go to Kologarn / Lich King<br />
<br />
Copy paste of every instance ever. Go in, fight boss, go to next boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's my own fault, I keep reading these things and I keep wondering why I am astonished every time at people's ignorance, or the things they whine about :/</div></div><hr />

That's what makes you a fanboy if you actually get hurt/mad because someone has the nerve to state that they dislike something. It's pretty dumb. <br />
<br />
But yeah I'm not too excited for this raid. The whole mogu and mantid stuff doesn't interest me. The entire tier of raid content so far has been pretty good when it comes to how fun the bosses are and the challenge on some heroic fights, but for lore purposes and art I just am not into it at all. None of it feels like Warcraft to me. I don't care that we don't have an end expansion bad guy like we usually do, but I do wish we were fighting something we knew about already. Like I would have preferred another Burning Legion focused expansion over MoP for sure. I want to go to Argus or Xoroth a different planet. I think that would have been awesome. Or an expansion solely focused on the Titans would have been awesome too but I suspect they are doing that for the next expansion. <br />
<br />
Oh well.<br />

good for the no lifes. for the mortals is not. ok enjoy boredom on holidays cause when work starts we bring a new patch. yey<br />
<br />
Lol really? I didn't think anyone was considered a no life on WoW anymore with how casual the game has become. <br />
<br />
You do realize though most people would be upset if the patch came out during holidays right? And no one said the patch would be out 'when work starts'. It said the PTR would be out then, not the patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PTR, split between normal and heroic modes, LFR... all things that completely killed the epic side of raiding.</div></div><hr />
