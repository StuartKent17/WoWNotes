We are making some upcoming changes to the Elemental shaman tree. Our goal was to streamline a few of the utility-based talents while giving shamans a little more damage scaling in later tiers of gear.<br />
<br />
Unrelenting Storm – reduced from 5 points to 3 points. Bonus is 4/8/12% of your Intellect returned as mana.<br />
Elemental Warding – now reduces all damage (not just Nature, Fire and Frost) taken by 2/4/6%<br />
Elemental Shields – this talent has been removed, since its effects were combined with Elemental Warding.<br />
Storm, Earth and Fire – reduced from 5 points to 3 points, but keeps around the same net benefit. In addition to current effects, also increases Wind Shock range. The damage bonus to Flame Shock has increased to 60% at 3 ranks. Storm, Earth and Fire has been moved up the tree as well.<br />
Shamanism – this is a new 5 point talent in the old Storm, Earth and Fire position. Your Lightning Bolt and Lava Burst gain an additional percentage of your bonus damage. We have not finalized the numbers, but it will probably be something like 10% for Lightning Bolt and 20% for Lava Burst at max ranks.<br />
<br />
These changes will be available in the next minor content patch, and are in addition to the AE changes mentioned previously. <br />

Dual Talent specialization<br />
We don't have an ETA. We would love to get it in for 3.1 but if I said it will be in 3.1 and it isn't, then players get mad. It's easier if we just say &quot;soon.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/12891016624-eta-on-dual-spec.html))<br />
<br />
New dances<br />
New dances are something we would still like to add. However, we will not add dances until we feel that they meet with our highest standards. So these are something we can look forward to down the road, not in the near future. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/13116131707-where-are-my-new-dances-blizzard.html))<br />
<br />
Mana regeneration nerf<br />
As a few players have referenced, we thought mana regen got to a point at the end of BC where players could just generally ignore it and assumed that mana was just a system you eventually graduate out of (kind of like experience).<br />
<br />
We don't want you to be out of mana constantly, but we do want the risk of that to exist. We balance some spells based on their mana cost for example and when you can always use your most expensive, least efficient spell without consequence, then your cheap and efficient spells don't compete.<br />
<br />
Mana is a resource to be managed, much like health or cooldowns. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/12890953932-ghost-crawler-question-why-nerf-spirit.html))<br />

Upcoming Feral Changes<br />
Armor<br />
We changed the way armor worked because we thought it was a bad design that a druid with the Naxx 25 armor trinkets would be amazing and one lacking them would be far behind, perhaps to the extent that you wouldn't be invited to tank. As a few people have pointed out, the change to the armor calculation is as much of a nerf as not getting those trinkets to drop is a nerf.<br />
<br />
Having armor as a good stat is fun. Having armor as such a good stat that you don't really care what else the item has on it is a problem. (And to be fair, I initially didn't realize the situation was quite as broken as it was, so thanks to all the persistent druids out there on this and other forums.) While some of you liked the element of having to get a couple of fairly rare drops to be a really good tank, other druids seem to understand the problem and agree with the change.<br />
<br />
Stuff besides armor<br />
The other part of the design is that without bonus armor being so ridiculously good for druids, you are left with fewer stats on which you can try to improve your tanking survivability. This is the &quot;It may have been broken, but it's all we had&quot; argument.<br />
<br />
While I think it is a bit silly to totally discount Stamina (&quot;because nobody wants to be a mana sponge&quot;) and Dodge (&quot;because it has diminishing returns&quot;) as bad tank stats, overall we are sympathetic to the idea that it's fun to get drops that make you a better tank and druids don't get to do that as much as other classes. We're talking about other ways to scale your mitigation through gear. I don't have any announcements to make about how that would work, but you should keep a couple of things in mind: 1) We wouldn't want to do it through armor or dodge, since making it easier to get those values very high unsolves the problem again, 2) Adding additional mitigation of any kind would probably mean having to nerf Ferals in other ways (like say armor) to keep you from getting too far ahead of other tanks. But we need to see what block actually does for paladins and warriors too. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/12891372479-upcoming-hunter-changes-part-iii.html))<br />

Hunter Arena issues<br />
Because it is so difficult to get intelligent discussion on this topic, I am creating this new thread. It will be heavily moderated.<br />
<br />
You don't have to play a hunter to post here. But I am only interested in a discussion of mechanics, problems, ideas and solutions.<br />
<br />
This is not a place to request a massive overhaul of talents. This is not a place for your 5 page manifesto on how to redesign the class. This is not a place to whine about past neglect or how Blizzard doesn't understand or care about class. This is not a place to declare hunters are OP and how we should pay attention to a different class. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=13115791521&amp;sid=1))<br />

Changing spellpower plate items<br />
It would feel very elegant to get rid of healing plate. But it is a pretty major change and one you aren't likely to see anytime soon. The logical choice is to make Holy (and all paladin healing really) scale off of AP somehow. But then you also need to solve the mana pool and regen problems because melee dps rings don't have int or mp5 on them.<br />
<br />
It's not an impossible problem to solve, but it is a big one. Changing melee druids to share a lot of gear with rogues has been tricky and something we are still working on. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/12891016441-ghostcrawler-saysrespellpower-plate.html))<br />

Consolidated list of upcoming Paladin changes - Clarifications<br />
I made some clarifications to my initial post.<br />
<br />
You can use Hand of Protection during the internal cooldown, just not on yourself. The idea is to prevent the paladin from being able to combo damage immunity. We want you to still be able to use it on others.<br />
<br />
The change to Judgements of the Pure is in addition to its current haste effects.<br />
<br />
The taunt is called Hand of Judgement. It has a 30 yard range and 8 sec cooldown. It does a bit of Holy damage so that you can break sheep or freezing traps to pull mobs.<br />
<br />
The change to Judgement of Wisdom was so Protection and Ret paladins (and Feral druids and whoever else) didn't feel like they were supposed to stack Int for mana, since there is none on their gear. We picked a number that shouldn't be a nerf to most Holy paladins, though it will mean that it won't keep scaling as your Int climbs, so I imagine it will be called a nerf anyway. :) We'll keep an eye on this -- perhaps adding an effect to a Holy talent or something to increase the return.

Upcoming AE DPS Changes and totems<br />
I realize buffing totems sounds strange to players who are used to loltotems. One of the designers just made the comment that telling Elemental you are buffing damage totems would be like telling Holy priests we are nerfing CoH and you're expected to area heal with Holy Nova now.<br />
<br />
But the change to Magma Totem in particular is substantial. The base points went from 170 to 370 and the coefficient from 0.67 to 1.0. In our tests, the pulses were doing something like 600 damage. You would be hard-pressed to get that kind of increase out of Totem of Wrath, even considering its benefit to the whole raid.<br />
<br />
Yes you have to run up, but we don't think that is too much to ask considering you can still Chain Lightning or whatever while the totem does its thing.<br />
<br />
Totems are a core piece of the shaman design. We want to make them work, not remove them from the game. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12891294995-upcoming-ae-dps-changes.html))<br />

Warlock Arena Issues<br />
Warlocks have been commenting since beta that they are not Arena viable. We want to understand what changes the community thinks we would need to make to get you Arena viable. If that list of changes runs into the 100s and means touching every talent, then you are much less likely to see them implemented.<br />
<br />
Challenge yourself to state the problem in as few words as possible. If you can't nail it that simply then I would argue you haven't considered the issue enough. For purposes of this thread I am trying to isolate &quot;Gee wouldn't it be nice if&quot; from &quot;We can't function without.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn't phrase the original question this way because I didn't want you to think we would only make a single change, but, if it helps to address the topic...<br />
<br />
What is the ONE change you would make to warlocks to help them in Arenas? (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=13115791524&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=10#196))<br />

Heroic Leap<br />
The ghoul won't try to exploit movement problems. Death Grip isn't a problem because we know exactly where the DK is and can assume that is a legal position. Heroic Leap on the other hand let players click anywhere they wanted to try and cheese pathing. Eventually, some of them found holes in the terrain they could jump through. Fixing all of those potential problem areas in the terrain was a pretty heavy price to pay for one talent.<br />
<br />
We could have changed Heroic Leap to not have a targeting component, like Blink and Disengage, but we thought that would make it Blink and Disengage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13116311677-heroic-leap.html))<br />

yea, i guess that could be the solution, too, and some talent in holy for 1 point, where mail gear would award bonus armor (dunno the coefs, 1,7 maybe?), tho im not sure how ti wouldaffect eleshaman gear, since there are already alot of resto mail pieces but not so much of ele pieces anyway</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Anyway, I haven't seen this much Elemental shaman lovin' since...ever.<br />
<br />
Also, did they just replace a talent I never use with one that's currently an essential part of my build? Can I get 3 more talent points please?</div></div><hr />

yes warlocks should be less anti-melle sry guys but u play with dots...and ur cloth,,and u got a pet,and fears which u can use it sooo many times if ur coupled with a healer i cant interrupt all of them,, That was the class designation for pvp, cause they´ve got almost none of avoidance spells. And that´s what makes it special.<br />
<br />
<br />
OH WANNA MENTION GOD MODE METAMORPHOSIS???i crit eviscerate on u 1k max??while being mowed down by ur pet and dots??<br />

<br />
I'm guessing that if they do change the plate SP, they would change the SP plate drops according to the change they made .... so If anything... there would just be more DPS plate dropping no ?</div></div><hr />

Totems should be undestroyable and untargettable.<br />
But that would be too OP :/<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Unmacroable and maybe untab-targetable.<br />
<br />
So the only way to destroy a totem is to actually click on it and attack.</div></div><hr />

As a rogue I'd like to have a ranged AoE like a Hunters Volley. Is it a reasonable request? probably not.</div></div><hr />

because rogues have ranged dps ability and its prefectly logical for them to be able to have a ranged castable aoe.<br />
elemental shamans =/= rogues.</div></div><hr />

I guess you're stupid and can't read. They said they were removing the threat component from Magma totem. As in it will cause no threat. As in everything you wrote was irrelevant or downright incorrect.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lolbeams</div><div class="date">2008-11-26, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok. I just found out that they removed the threat component as was about to edit my post but theres no point now. Now since you've decided to call me stupid, tell me what else was wrong about that post? What other part was irrelevant or incorrect? Don't just try to dismiss it, actually respond please. thanks.<br />
Removal of the threat component is a long overdue fix but by no means makes this a viable form of AoE, let alone able to compete with other classes AoE.<br />
edit: still no response? guess you prefer to dismiss another persons argument than actually discussing/debating it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
totems.. people who continue to play shamans don't hate totems.. so many people just say /reroll. that isn't our issue. imho we are just looking for some scale-ability with them.. they have the HP as when we 1st learn then at like lvl 10 or 12. .....and we have felt that way since vanilla wow, and blizz has felt the opposite. so with the wotlk totems, if they had more HP then like people have said they would be OP. <br />
<br />
Hmm How about totems do something cool, like a stun (for earth totems) a fire dot for fire totems, a healing/mana dot for water.. and something clever for air. if/when they are destroyed... maybe the stun one would be way OP. but rewarding the shaman for dropping the totem would be a cool idea.</div></div><hr />

Your post is completely irrelevant because a threat-less Magma totem with a 1.0 spell power coefficient is a viable form of AoE, regardless of how you feel about it. You don't like totems. We get it. Blizzard disagrees, and says totems are an key factor of Shamans. If you can't handle totems, you should re-roll. It's like the Hunters who want to get rid of their pet; that's not a Hunter, that's a Mage. If you don't want to play with totems, you want to play a Mage, not an Elemental Shaman.</div></div><hr />

Though I do believe burst damage to be a big problem for locks, I feel stunlock and being frozen by mages to be the most difficult situation to overcome for me as a lock in the arena setting. The &quot;Every Man for Himself&quot; racial trait is a one-time shot sort of deal with a 2 minute cooldown. Perhaps the trait, or Alliance Medallion, should break the stun/movement impairment and keep it from happening again for another 20 seconds, which will allow you a chance at survival. This is just my opionion. I am an average player and will be no better than an average player. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Maybe... but having AP as the stat we are going to need the gear might have str, crit and even haste. There is going to be a lot of competition for the gear.</div></div><hr />

It is just a pity that AE + BW is not a very good combo compared to far safer alternatives as Blizzard or the almighty SOC.<br />

Connecting with shammies, well, gratz to them for the improvement.<br />

AOE without risk is a bit lame :-\</div></div><hr />

I think that phase shift talent shammies have should have been a warlock thing, probably a demonology talent. Another thing that might be interesting is to bring back the dungeon tier 1 effect of the 2% chance of fearing a target that hits you, or having a 2-3% chance of a stun reflect. Another possibility is a 4th point, or an improved backlash talent that requires 3 points in the original, that gives the lock a 25% chance to release a hellfire wave when hit with no damage to yourself and no internal CD(maybe not that last part about the CD).</div></div><hr />

<br />
This just might be the stupidest thing I have ever read in regards to itemization. I mean as opposed to what? The no competition that you have now? That sounds really fair.<br />
<br />
Nothing is more horrible for my 10 mans right now then getting healing plate gear with no Paladin...I mean of course I could bring a Paladin to eliminate that problem, but EVERYONE else has competition with their loot. You shouldn't be any different.<br />
<br />
I think the concept of AP being used for healing is kind of interesting. We will see...but whining because you might have to compete for loot is crazy.</div></div><hr />
