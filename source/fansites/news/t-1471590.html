Warlords of Draenor - No Realm First Achievements<br />
As mentioned in the Patch 5.4 Dev Interviews (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1345), realm first leveling and profession achievements won't be added for Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />

Battleground Honor Increases Coming Tuesday<br />
We now have a date for the battleground honor increases (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3809-Battleground-Honor-Increase-Stat-Squish-System-Changes-Blue-Posts-Tweets-Fan-Art).<br />
<br />

<br />
Battle.Net Desktop App Chat<br />
We recently got some updates on chat in the Battle.Net Desktop App (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3273-Battle-net-Desktop-Client-Services-Activated-and-Beta-Test-Opt-in) and the Appear Offline mode (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/236762-appear-offline-option-coming-soon-to-battlenet/) from a while back. <br />
<br />
A recent update to the client removed one of the older chat display styles, added and tweaked avatars, modified some chat related things, and removed the Beta label.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/march/appearOffline.png (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/440536278858096641) <br />
<br />
If you're an astute observer, you'll note from various postings on the internet that there is indeed chat functionality inside the client, but it is disabled.<br />
<br />
The reason why it isn't enabled is simple. The servers aren't ready to handle it yet.<br />
<br />
Having said that, chat will be ready soon(tm)<br />
<br />
Better answer would be &quot;chat is not ready yet&quot; than &quot;servers can't handle it&quot;<br />
You're right, poor choice of words. Chat was definitely not ready, but it is closer now.<br />
<br />
The problem with the chat system was related to when you're logged into multiple games at the same time. For purposes of this discussion, Battle.net app is considered another game. <br />
<br />
See who is online (You'll need friends for this). In a future update (coming soon) you'll be able to chat with them too. (Source (http://us.battle.net/en/forum/topic/11882868485?page=3#55))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
&quot;We want to reduce the amount of buttons required to play and make the game easier for players who come back.&quot; WHY DUMB IT DOWN?<br />
Reducing the number of buttons required is not the same as dumbing it down. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438159423291154433))<br />
<br />
More behind the scenes of class design:There are hard many parts of designing a spell, but most people wouldn't guess one of the hardest. Naming it. Giving a spell a good name is paramount. It has to be representative, awesome sounding, appropriate, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438547225858154496))<br />
One of the most difficult things is resisting the urge to use &quot;Divine&quot; or &quot;Holy&quot; on a Paladin/Priest spell, *again*. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438549783825772544))<br />
<br />
Keeping 100% uptime on DOTs and performing a filler rotation is not engaging. Intelligently using procs is<br />
Intelligently using procs isn't going away. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438432424498716672))<br />
Don't mistake snapshotting's removal for procs not benefitting you. Procs' effects are just restricted to their duration now. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438432720398462976))<br />
if that is the case are we looking at dynamic updating of DOTs in Warlord's?<br />
Yes, that's what removing snapshotting is. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438435463133556736))<br />
Since it Dynamically updates there's no other point. Basically DoT classes are boring now?<br />
No, pretty sure you're misunderstanding something fundamental. DoTs are updated on every tick, not when they wear off. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438542098623504384))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
will you update the character login backgrounds along with the new models? The UD one is very outdated. Thanks!<br />
I agree those need some love, maybe not at same time as characters but its something we've wanted to do for a while now. (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/431843557784047616))<br />
<br />
Hello good sir, with the new character model updates in WoD i was hoping to see an option for long beards for my casters!<br />
cool idea, not adding extra options with this pass, hope to do so in the future. (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/431842694055198720))<br />
<br />
Proving Grounds<br />
Any plans for handling scaling of CMs/PGs different in WoD? Scaling down 120 ilvls makes classes play very differently.<br />
We're investigating the potential of scaling PGs up to your ilvl. Not a guarantee, just an investigation. Has Pros/Cons. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438039015468437504))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Will most classes only have one viable spec for pvp (like warriors) in WoD? would be easier to balance?<br />
It is a decent goal for classes that only have one role, but not for classes that have multiple. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/433439167754694657))<br />
<br />
Can you implement the SotA bomb extra action button in IoC as well?<br />
Yes eventually. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/431843409372790784))<br />
<br />
you know why resi should be in gear? Smooth resi scaling. Suddenly added big resi feels bad. Takes time for gear to fix.<br />
Certainly true. But the whole player base doesn't gear at the same rate, specifically ungeared players entering the game. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438796918185938944))<br />
<br />
Was leaving resilience on heirlooms an oversight? Maybe it could be replaced with something more useful?<br />
Resilience is on all lower level gear (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438796576505335808))<br />
<br />
why didnt you reset mmr?<br />
We don't reset MMR because it is system designed to match up players of equal skill. We do reset inflation however. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438429905701720064))<br />

They came out with a blog last week, and are coming with a blog highly likely today (was hinted at on twitter by posting a &quot;Friday&quot; music video in response to people asking for the next blog).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Preparing for the leveling process by playing the beta actually made me enjoy the questing experience allot. I managed to take a good look at all the quests multiple times while figuring out the fastest lvling path. Now they removed the achievement there is no point in actualyl checking out all the quests and I'll just rush trough it randomly after release.<br />
<br />
Silly thinking, acting like a realm first achievement is actually 'content' and creating 'content' for only 1-3 people is bad design makes no sense at all. I'm sure hundreds of people per server are going for realm first and it motivates many players to dive into the expansion the moment it gets released, which is an awesome experience for many.<br />
<br />
With no raids released the first week, and no realm first achievements available, what are you actually going to do the first week? Level to 90 day 1, get all dungeon gear day 2-3 and log off day 4-7?</div></div><hr />

I felt the need to compete I couldnt pay attention to the story and game. And I always thought it was silly because blizz says that they wont let you fly till max level in previous expansions and this time it wont be till the first patch so you can experience the environment yet they put in something that gets you to rush through all of the content in a short time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I loved that rush of spending 24+ hours straight leveling super fast and competing with the other guys ... I'd actually take time off to work to do this. It was the &quot;once every few years&quot; event where all guild was on voice comms for 20 hours plus... some would crack, some would fall asleep, and some basked in glory. Tremendously fun. Disappeared, just like that. <br />
<br />
Thanks Blizz. It's not like there was time / resources used by this.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Lets face it every expansion the realm first max level has gone to the person who spends most of beta looking for a way to exploit (sorry I mean clever use of game mechanics) <br />
<br />
Nope, I have seem countless people beat the BETA testers just because they play better. <br />
I didn't even play beta past level 87, and still got realm first versus people who had played the beta extensively. Im not a special snowflake, but there definitly more than just &quot;duh beta people know content&quot;. <br />
<br />
It's levelling. the content is easy you dont need to know it if you have half a brain you can win.</div></div><hr />

It's a lot of work for Blizz to track down people exploiting, take back their achievements, then find out who legitimately got realm first. Realm first is not content.

<br />
Lol I have never once had people cheer people on that were going for the achievement. As a matter of fact, I've witnessed more hostility than cheering towards people who were close. As I said, it encourages people to basically ignore the content and just race while finding the best exploits.</div></div><hr />

I got realm first 85 and realm first 90 mage doing nothing but questing with a friend of me (2man group). Getting these achievements without exploiting was perfecty doable on most realms. Ofcourse I did proper research on beta what quests/zones to skip.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I wrote above, removing the realm first achievement actually will let me see less of the zones instead of more.<br />
<br />
Going for realm first: 1) Play trough all questzones slowly to figure out all quests, experience the whole story of every zone. 2) Try a few different leveling routes and figure out how much you need to do to reach max lvl. 3) Figure out what routes are most efficient/what quests are worth skipping. 4) Play your optimal route ~2-3 times.<br />
<br />
Not going for realm first: 1) Play trough some questzones at random, skip random quests/zones and miss half of the story.<br />
<br />
So this really is a bad argument.</div></div><hr />

Then why don't we cry about not getting an achievement for cheering those people on too? It's the experience that matters in the end, right?<br />
So here's a thought, why not, for once, enjoy the experience of rushing through and ignoring all of the launch content instead of just spamming your achievement nobody cares about in Trade or whatever it is the World First crowd does?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right, they're not content. They're dangling carrots that encourage people to exploit like crazy. I think about half the people who got realm first profession achievements on my server for Cata used some sort of exploit to max their professions in 15 minutes. <br />
<br />
So yeah, I guess people enjoyed doing them if they enjoyed exploiting. Which is against TOS. So off it goes, and good riddance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Going for realm first: 1) Play trough all questzones slowly to figure out all quests, experience the whole story of every zone. 2) Try a few different leveling routes and figure out how much you need to do to reach max lvl. 3) Figure out what routes are most efficient/what quests are worth skipping. 4) Play your optimal route ~2-3 times.<br />
<br />
Not going for realm first: 1) Play trough some questzones at random, skip random quests/zones and miss half of the story.<br />
<br />
So this really is a bad argument.<br />
<br />
Same here, it might seem backward logic for some. But claiming removig the achievement will make people &quot;enjoy the content&quot; more is just wrong. People will speed level regardless of the achievement.<br />
<br />
Speed/marathon leveling is the closest thing to the propper hardcore progression raiding experience most people have an opertunity to get. that its removed really sucks =(<br />

<br />
Preparing for the leveling process by playing the beta actually made me enjoy the questing experience allot. I managed to take a good look at all the quests multiple times while figuring out the fastest lvling path. Now they removed the achievement there is no point in actualyl checking out all the quests and I'll just rush trough it randomly after release.<br />
<br />
Silly thinking, acting like a realm first achievement is actually 'content' and creating 'content' for only 1-3 people is bad design makes no sense at all. I'm sure hundreds of people per server are going for realm first and it motivates many players to dive into the expansion the moment it gets released, which is an awesome experience for many.<br />
<br />
With no raids released the first week, and no realm first achievements available, what are you actually going to do the first week? Level to 90 day 1, get all dungeon gear day 2-3 and log off day 4-7?<br />

When I achieved realm first 80 DK when Wrath was released, the only exploit I did was my ability to power through needing sleep. Other than that, I just powered through quests. And then, I wasn't even trying for realm first. Guild first, yes. Then when I realized I was leading the realm, I ballsed up. Although I remember a couple of Horde on my server for MoP that I believe exploited their way to realm first 90.<br />

<br />
I've never attempted, or wanted to attempt, getting a realm first leveling achievement. But that doesn't mean I don't understand the enjoyment that people get out of em. Once every two years you get to compete against possibly hundreds of people on your realm for an achievement. <br />
<br />
In the end does the achievement mean anything? No. But then again nothing we do in this game actually means anything.<br />
<br />
It's a fun thing to have in the game that doesn't negatively affect anyone else. Billy Bob on my server rushing to get Realm First Level 100 Druid doesn't take away from my leveling experience. Same goes with crafting. I couldn't care less if he beats me to max JC. It doesn't hurt my feelings.<br />
<br />
If people want to be competitive then let them. It doesn't hurt you.</div></div><hr />

It isn't a bad argument. You're just an exception, .. not the rule. The way you level, it seems, is all about the numbers .. not the content. You find which quests give the most XP, which routes allow for quicker succession of said quests, and which allow more choice of questing experience. In that sense, all you're doing is looking at your XP bar and counting how fast it rises with how fast you can run.<br />
<br />
But not going for realm first? You are allowed to play as you see fit. You don't have to randomly go through quest zones. You don't have to skip random quests. You don't have to miss the story. That is entirely up to you. Without a realm first achievement you are still completely in control of both your body and mind. If you want to go through beta to try to find the most successful route? Guess what. You can still do that! And you can even read the quest dialogue instead of skipping to the, &quot;Kill 10 Spore Bats&quot; and then counting how much XP doing so gave you.<br />
<br />
Me? I tried the entire speed leveling thing. Don't enjoy it. I miss out on so much just being able to go through at my own pace. I knock out lower quest zones, move on up to higher, and I go through each line. I don't have to worry about going JUST from the starter zone and worrying about which branch I'll go to next. I can do BOTH before heading to the next tier up. Because I'm not racing. <br />

I only really care for the leveling FOS, but back in cata I did JC realm first on Ravencrest-EU since it was the only proff you could get it and had to spend 4 days on (only like 10 min aday though)<br />
<br />
And also the guild got 3 or 4 serverfirst professions back then, none of them were done with any exploits. I know there was a LW exploit where you could get cata leather from lowlevel mobs before cata launch (I reported this bug, but dunno if it got fixed) so we didnt go for that. Rest was just gotten through good coordination between guildies. (we got realm first &quot;working as a team&quot;). <br />
<br />
As for levling exploits, your highly overestimating how many use this. Most people that exploit get rolled back (sometimes falsely, that sucks I guess). Your argument is along the lines of: &quot;Lets ban all sports cause a few people use illegal enhancement drugs&quot;..<br />

If he cares about the story and quests, he will pay attention to the story and quests. If he is in fact not talking total bull, then the world first rush is chaining him to his desk and forcing him to play through a storyline he simply does not care about, multiple times.</div></div><hr />

okay see that confuses me. IF you are going for realm first its all about speed, not enjoying the game and everything around it. So going for speed wouldn't be grabbing every quest, reading thru every one of them, watching the interaction. It would be grab quest, follow tracker, queue like crazy for dungeons and zerg it all. Whereas if you don't worry about how fast you go to get an achievement you just take your time, explore every spot out there and interact more.</div></div><hr />

Still, it should probably be possible to still get people to compete on their own accord without the achievement (people did so before achievements, after all), but it still kind of sucks, I think.</div></div><hr />

So please explain to us why you feel that doing all of the quests on beta for the sole purpose of blasting to 100 on live as quickly as possible is more preferable to you than doing all of the quests for the enjoyment and experience of actually doing the quests and seeing all of the story.<br />
<br />
Did you even read my post?<br />
<br />
You DONT see the full story when you level to 100. There are way more quests/zones/dungeons available as you need to get to level 100. You do 70% of the quests in one zone, do a random dungeon, do 50% of the quests in the other, skip a zone, do another one for 90%. Nobody who levels to 100 sees the whole story unless you continue questing for a very long time after you hit level 100.<br />
<br />
Is it preferable to have people see content ONCE, while also skipping half of this content because they outllvled it over someone seeing the FULL content, multiple times because he enjoys figuring out a way to get realm first.<br />
<br />
I really cant believe you guys cant see the fun into playing beta to see all the content and prepare for release, then taking some time off to have a LAN party with multiple friends, going to the shop together to buy tasty food and snacks, sleeping a few hours before the release, and then level to 100 as fast as you can with your friends to enjoy all the max level content together before going back to work again. The WoTLK, Cataclysm and MoP release all were memorable experiences and for sure more memorable then most friday/saturday-evenings going to the cinema/drinking a few beers with friends.<br />
<br />

get a life ?<br />

The fact you cant understand how the above is extremely fun is your loss I guess. I really wonder why you're wasting your life posting messages like that in this forum tbh, rather sad.</div></div><hr />

I definitely see the fun in that. I wouldn't want to race to 100 but hanging out with friends is awesome. I personally wouldn't want to thoroughly check out the beta though simply because I want to keep it as a &quot;surprise&quot; for when the game actually hits. But that's me.</div></div><hr />

You're just an exception, .. not the rule. The way you level, it seems, is all about the numbers .. not the content. You find which quests give the most XP, which routes allow for quicker succession of said quests, and which allow more choice of questing experience. In that sense, all you're doing is looking at your XP bar and counting how fast it rises with how fast you can run.<br />
<br />
But not going for realm first? You are allowed to play as you see fit. You don't have to randomly go through quest zones. You don't have to skip random quests. You don't have to miss the story. That is entirely up to you. Without a realm first achievement you are still completely in control of both your body and mind. If you want to go through beta to try to find the most successful route? Guess what. You can still do that! And you can even read the quest dialogue instead of skipping to the, &quot;Kill 10 Spore Bats&quot; and then counting how much XP doing so gave you.<br />
<br />
Me? I tried the entire speed leveling thing. Don't enjoy it. I miss out on so much just being able to go through at my own pace. I knock out lower quest zones, move on up to higher, and I go through each line. I don't have to worry about going JUST from the starter zone and worrying about which branch I'll go to next. I can do BOTH before heading to the next tier up. Because I'm not racing. <br />
<br />
The entire way you choose to play is still your choice. Achievement or not, you can play however you like.<br />
<br />
If I woudnt enjoy it I woudnt do it, simple. While everyone has different reasons to enjoy a game, nobody in this world plays games he doesnt enjoy. The achievement was an incentive for me to check out the whole story and enjoy the whole story. I knew more about the story then anyone who just logs in at expansion release and starts randomly lvling to max lvl (like &gt;90% of the players do). Without this incentive in the form of an achievement to check out the whole content I will have to re-evaluate if I believe its fun enough. And I believe the answer will be negative. I will still take some days off from work to level to max, farm dungeons and be fully prepared for the first raid but I wont spend hours on the beta checking out every single quest out there.</div></div><hr />

If a GM wants to grind some mobs and has a few guildies willing to let him tag them and nuke them down for him that is NOT exploitative behavior. Even though they stripped world first from him like idiots and had to go back and give it back to him and apologize. Yet they're still crying about it. Get over it. You get an achievement for getting a haircut but a fun realm race they freak out over. Btw, realm first isn't &quot;content&quot;, not surprised they have any idea what that word means when they think adding 4 difficulties is &quot;content&quot;.<br />
<br />
One of my favorite parts of the new expac is racing my guildies to max level. I know I won't get a realm first since I'm on a high pop but seeing peoples names pop up in yellow over and over and people in trade/general gratzing them was always awesome to see.

Realm first stuff creates a lot of extra tickets, which are already high the first week of an expansion. The following things I KNOW happened during MoP<br />
<br />
1. A ton of people ticketed because of the grey ´node´ issue caused by the +10 spade/pick. I read of two different people who ´reported´ other players for exploiting because they got world-first mining/herbing while still in Jade Forest.<br />
<br />
2. Guilds reported for exploiting - I read this one a few different places also. Guilds would track down someone who was in the lead and kill quest mobs around that player to prevent them from leveling up, while their guildmate quested somewhere else<br />
<br />
3. All the nonsense with the elite turtles. Again.. a ton of tickets sent in because people who were losing the race considered it an exploit.<br />
<br />
When the devs talk about the amount of work it takes to create ´content´ for 1-3 people per spec/realm. The work they are talking about is not the devs adding achievements.. the work is the work answering all the tickets that the race generates. Players are really stupid, and will send tickets for every little thing when something is as competitive as world-firsts.</div></div><hr />

I got realm first rogue 90 and didn't enjoy levelling that fast really. It was 15-18 hours of stressful levelling. Didn't go for it at first, until I realized that I didn't see other rogues around me as I levelled, and then went berserk, hating the damn panda npcs constantly telling me to &quot;slow doooooown&quot;.<br />
<br />
The realm first guy, on my realm, is usually the same guy that has found what could be described as exploits, which usually means easy to kill mobs, that give way too much xp for their effort. In MoP he stood at the alliance starting area, killing constantly spawning streams of horde mobs for 6-8 hours straight. 2 expansions before that he'd apparently found a cave with those easy to kill with good xp mobs, as well.<br />

Blizzard is trying in many ways to force players into doing content they previously didnt care about. The more content players play, the longer they stick around and the more subscription/expansions they pay for. Giving players incentive to do undervalued content is never a bad thing for the game.</div></div><hr />

No, pretty sure you're misunderstanding something fundamental. DoTs are updated on every tick, not when they wear off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizzard clearly doesn't understand this question. DoT classes will be really boring now that the only thing you're doing is updating dots when they're about to run out and then use fillers between that. As a feral I think the class will be piss easy now, especially with how long they've made the duration of everything.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lamelight</div><div class="date">2014-03-07, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">okay see that confuses me. IF you are going for realm first its all about speed, not enjoying the game and everything around it. So going for speed wouldn't be grabbing every quest, reading thru every one of them, watching the interaction. It would be grab quest, follow tracker, queue like crazy for dungeons and zerg it all. Whereas if you don't worry about how fast you go to get an achievement you just take your time, explore every spot out there and interact more.<br />
<br />
People play this game for ALOT of different reasons, I get that the reason blizz does this is to get people to follow the sory more, But that wount change anything for the people that plan on getting to 100 as fast as possible anyway. People did rush to 70 even if there was no achievement for it. and wowprogress is way more used now than it was back then. Personally I dont really care if the FoS is in the game or not, I think achievements is pointless feature. But with removing the server first some people will actually do alot less of the story. (A better way to give people an insentive to do follow the storyline would be to actually make it the fastest way of levling.)<br />
<br />
I know personally that my shaman is the only charr that did quests in every questing zones (and prettymuch every quest) when Wrath first came out. the reason: I was trying to get server first lvl 80 shaman. And youd be suprised how much of the story I learned. For Cata we did proffs and then some dungeon leveling with guild. was super social (planing all the professions etc.) But the result is I hardly did any quests in Uldum on any charr, and TH and vashj max 50%.<br />
<br />
For MOP again. Didnt have a chance at serverfirst (was on RC-EU so was against FS) + I had no beta access (ofc I could have had if that was really something I felt I needed) + I didnt raid (heroic) on my DK during DS so my gear was pretty crap, on top of that I was stuck on the airship for 3hours... Got to 90 in 21 hours (18 if you dont count the 3 hours on the ship) and my DK is the only charr I leveled that actually did most of the Quest zones.<br />
<br />
For WoD I will probably do the same, quest as fast as possible, get an overall idea of the story then close to 98 just do dungeons (skiping story content) cause it will probably give more higher ilvl gear faster. and for the rest of my charrs, just skip as much of the story as possible.<br />
<br />
People pla this game for different reasons, even if you dont find it fun/chellenging/interesting to speed level doesnt mean someone else will. It's like PvEers that Dont PvP or PvPers that dont PvE, both groups miss out on a large portion of the game. This is like making a PvP item BiS for a PvEer or a PvE trinket BiS for a PvPer. Blizzard is trying to force our hand to experience more story, the porblem is the method they use isnt effective (they should instead make questing more profitable in terms of leveling fast)</div></div><hr />

You're going to play the way mommy and daddy blizzard tells you and thats that. You will NOT level fast or skip content blizzard worked so hard on. (even though we all know it's pretty pointless just like leveling 1-90)<br />
<br />
Now go and level to 100 as slow as humanly possible (right after you paid to skip leveling from 1-90) and make sure you look at every bush and tree blizzard spawned into the game or else!<br />
<br />
Don't make them tell you twice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I ain't never seen a poll or anything on the subject, but as far as I can see it sours the launch experience for far more people than who actually wind up earning the achievements.<br />
Launch only happens once, and the achievements sit there being useless forever.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lamelight</div><div class="date">2014-03-07, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this just comes down to a customer service issue. Realm first stuff creates a lot of extra tickets, which are already high the first week of an expansion. The following things I KNOW happened during MoP<br />
<br />
1. A ton of people ticketed because of the grey ´node´ issue caused by the +10 spade/pick. I read of two different people who ´reported´ other players for exploiting because they got world-first mining/herbing while still in Jade Forest.<br />
<br />
2. Guilds reported for exploiting - I read this one a few different places also. Guilds would track down someone who was in the lead and kill quest mobs around that player to prevent them from leveling up, while their guildmate quested somewhere else<br />
<br />
3. All the nonsense with the elite turtles. Again.. a ton of tickets sent in because people who were losing the race considered it an exploit.<br />
<br />
When the devs talk about the amount of work it takes to create ´content´ for 1-3 people per spec/realm. The work they are talking about is not the devs adding achievements.. the work is the work answering all the tickets that the race generates. Players are really stupid, and will send tickets for every little thing when something is as competitive as world-firsts.<br />
<br />
This is probably the real reason they are removing it! =(</div></div><hr />

While I hear your personal frustration, your logic is a bit dodgy mate. Even if every person defending their realm firsts felt the same way as you (and I doubt most do), it would still represent a very, very small minority of the total WoW population.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can still rush to be the first person on your server to hit 100...you just don't get the e-peen stroking of a server-wide message saying that you've hit max level before anyone else.<br />
<br />
The experience of racing to max level is still there if you aren't desperately seeking some form of in-game physical acknowledgement of leveling superiority (i.e. wanting Blizzard to kneel before you for figuring out the best exploit to level with).</div></div><hr />

While everyone has different reasons to enjoy a game, nobody in this world plays games he doesnt enjoy. The achievement was an incentive for me to check out the whole story and enjoy the whole story. I knew more about the story then anyone who just logs in at expansion release and starts randomly lvling to max lvl (like &gt;90% of the players do). Without this incentive in the form of an achievement to check out the whole content I will have to re-evaluate if I believe its fun enough.<br />
<br />
This is an interesting argument. Basically you are saying you played the game in Beta to experience the content so that you could skip through it once the content goes live.<br />
<br />
While this may be a good incentive for you personally to experience the game, I think it's fair to say it kinda runs contrary to the spirit of the game. The game should be enjoyed once it's live. People competing for realm firsts tend to miss out on a lot, and for most of them it ends up being in vain because there can only be one winner. I had a guildie who went for realm first warrior, and missed out by about 15 minutes. It was a huge let down for the guy, and he spent the next few months not really knowing what the MoP story was, while the rest of us got to really enjoy the expansion and its story a lot more.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I believe the answer will be negative. I will still take some days off from work to level to max, farm dungeons and be fully prepared for the first raid but I wont spend hours on the beta checking out every single quest out there.<br />
<br />
My point exactly. The beta isn't intended to be your gaming experience of the new expansion. It's not meant to be there for you to figure out how to get a special achievement. The fact that a number of people used the beta to get the edge needed to win the race really spoils it for everyone else. IMO it would be a far more meaningful race if everyone in the realm was on the same footing, going into it with no prior information.<br />
<br />
This is one of the primary reasons why I believe they canned the idea. The kind of crap that the world first people pulled off to get it (Athene for Cata and then that FS guy for MoP) just ruined the fun of it. It goes against the spirit of the game, and the mere fact that there were debates about whether it was technically cheating or just a case of clever rules lawyering indicates that it was a broken feature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the best guilds in the world use the PTR to learn the boss mechanics/tactics, how is it any different with them? Neither race(to realm first level X, or to kill X boss) is suited for everyone, only for a groups of people that are really, really interesting in achieving it.</div></div><hr />

I have never competed for it, and I don't particularly desire to see it go away, but I can understand why Blizzard sees it as a negative feature - because I have observed it becoming a toxic event for a lot of people who did choose to compete.</div></div><hr />

The amazing stress, tension, panic etc were not exactly good feelings, specially when nearing the last hours of the leveling. I also never played any beta to max level because I don't want spoilers on new content, and for WoD I would probably need to. So all in all, you should be happy. You can still blast to maximum level however you want and you will NOT &quot;lose&quot;, which is a huge thing. When I felt all that joy and glory when the achievement popped, after getting some sleep I thought about how the other players felt; very close in exp, all that time (14+ hours) only to LOSE in the end. I understand people like to feel the thrill of the race, but well, you got Hardcore Diablo for that! (just kidding)</div></div><hr />

I never said it was a good thing. But I acknowledge that it a necessary evil since a PTR is needed to test out the stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Neither race(to realm first level X, or to kill X boss) is suited for everyone, only for a groups of people that are really, really interesting in achieving it.<br />
<br />
Race for X boss kill takes a lot more commitment than world first level XX. Also, although world first raid kills almost certainly require practice in Beta, most of the work is still done in the actual game. I think the fact that some people spent weeks playing beta to get ready for a leveling race that took less than 24 hours in the actual game is just sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's their very own business. Nobody is holding a gun at someone's head forcing them to compete for realm first. If it's not your thing- good, I'm sure that there are other part of the gameplay of the incoming expansion that concern you, but there are people that enjoy this particular thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So in your opinion its better to not experience the content at all over experiencing it in BETA?<br />
<br />
Without the achievement I wont bother doing all the quests in beta. I will just rush trough a few random zones once the game goes live and get my character geared up as fast as possible for raids. I will miss out a load of content compared to the previous expansions, where I could dream every corner and quest and story of every zone because I prepared for the server first race.<br />
<br />
If you really think that those previously rushing for server first will suddenly slowly read every quest and do every quest in each zone in chronological order and continue questing even after they hit level 100 to experience the full story your delusional. These compatitive players want to get to level 100 and gear themselves up for raids. Thats how they enjoy the game, and theres nothing wrong with this. At least previously the achievement gave these players a reason to check out all the quest content, now this reason is gone.</div></div><hr />

It sends out a message that they want you to rush through the leveling content, which they don't. It might cause demand for customer service as tickets, which means that people with real problems have to wait, and it has balance issues with the new troll racial and heirlooms from Garrosh so it's better not to have it as official achievement.</div></div><hr />

Might as well just let me buy a level 100 and skip the entire leveling process and get to end game where the real game starts for many players.<br />

&quot;We're gonna bring faster expansions and content.&quot; inb4 MoP being longest expansion to date for WoW. I don't think there's any chance the expansion will come out before September or even October. They've been silent since BlizzCon almost, showing us models we don't really need to see now, and posting useless blogs imo. <br />
<br />
If there would've been at least 2 or 3 more features coming with WoD I would understand the delay. But what's the delay for? Models? Garrison? Can't bay anything else, I'm not hyped for either of them, sure models are cool, but I don't look at my character much. And Garrison, meh decent feature but guess it's taking up way to much time. It should've been in with expansion after WoD and bring something less time consuming with WoD.<br />

<br />
To all the haters, grow up. Just because you lack the drive/interest to do it, don't hate on those that do. I busted my ass for my Realm First achievement and was also able to enjoy the story because I actually grew up reading books and don't need my finger to help read like most of the wow base (stay in school.) I can also guarantee that not one person on my server exploited to do so (since I knew most of them.) I'm also willing to bet, aside from the ridiculously overpopulated realms (where a majority of the &quot;pro&quot; players are,) this is the case. <br />

Also, to those that say there's more animosity than good feelings towards those that do; you're probably right. Anytime there's someone striving to be the best there's going to be haters, regardless of what. You think top guilds don't hear people talk shit about them all the time? Of course they do. You think top players don't have people talking shit about them either? It's just like life. You'll have more people hoping you fail than succeed. But I'll never forget when I achieved Realm First and the amount of positive tells I received from both Horde and Alliance players. There are those that appreciate and respect the commitment it takes.<br />
<br />
Professions, I can kind of understand. With Realm First comes the raping of the AH from the people that have ridiculous amounts of gold to buy mats which does nothing but inflate prices at the start (which may and probably still will, end up happening.) This is the reason why I didn't have my professions maxed until I leveled a grinding alt. So I might actually be able to enjoy professions in the beginning.<br />
<br />
But what harm does leveling cause to the other player base?<br />
<br />
We still face the same challenges that the rest of the player base does and other than a few bad apples, we do it legitimately. Hell, end game raiders are still going to fly through leveling regardless so they're ready for the start of raiding. Have to max professions and get they're perks, have to grind dungeons and get the best gear. <br />
<br />
So really, who is this catering to? <br />
<br />
The people who do it, so they can &quot;enjoy the lore?&quot; <br />
<br />
Or to the casuals who don't/can't, because they didn't want to work hard enough to get it?<br />
<br />
Either way, I'm still gonna be one of the firsts to 100 because I'm a raider and want to be fully prepared come raid time. I'll also have a firm grasp on the lore while I do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not everyone is going to be whoring the game none-stop to the level cap. 1 week before raids go live is fine for 90% of the games player base imo</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah. urm. Newsflash. People gonna do that anyways. Removing the achievment will just put a few people off. The exploiters will still exploit. The rushers will still rush</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont think everyone here is so selfish as to care only when it affects them. People are not that miserable... not yet.</div></div><hr />

Just because you tried once a realm first and failed and thought &quot;!!this is BS, how can anyone level faster than me &gt;=(!!&quot; , doesnt mean everyone is exploiting.<br />
<br />
On my mid/high population realm i got realm first Blacksmith on MoP and maybe missed realm first 90 by like 2 hours. And i didnt participate in the beta, or read any info whatsoever. And i wasnt even trying to level fast, i just quest fast i guess.<br />
<br />
Blizzard removing them is just another way to cater to those people that feel discouraged because they cant get some achievements, and its a wrong move imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I am saying is that something that was meant to a bit of fun for the community got spoiled because some people chose to turn it something far more serious.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nobody is holding a gun at someone's head forcing them to compete for realm first. If it's not your thing- good, I'm sure that there are other part of the gameplay of the incoming expansion that concern you, but there are people that enjoy this particular thing.<br />
<br />
I believe there are a lot of people who enjoyed a fair and honest race. World first level cap has been neither fair nor honest for some time now because of the very small minority who have decided that they enjoy &quot;winning&quot; at all costs.<br />
<br />
When Athene went and &quot;won&quot; the race the level 85 I was mildly intrigued to see how he did it. Once I saw what he did, my first thought was that he had been pretty clever. But it very soon dawned on me that he had just killed all the fun for the vast majority of the WoW playerbase.<br />
<br />
So your attitude about how it's fun for a few, and the majority must go away is actually pretty abhorrent. When the cost of &quot;fun&quot; for a small minority comes at the cost of fun for the vast majority, there is something very, very wrong and Blizzard have recognised that.</div></div><hr />

Ive always loved expansion releases with a passion. In MoP I managed to get realm first Paladin on Grim Batol. I had played to 90 in the beta but had not really paid attention to any specific route or doing any research. That Realm First achievements makes people enjoy the game less is complete bullshit. Every expansion this game have had Ive been sitting on voice com with several friends, talking and playing for a day nonstop. <br />
<br />
The Realm First achivement is something alot of people enjoy vastly. Not only the ones who actually have a shot at getting the achivement will enjoy it. I was second of my class in Cata and I still enjoyed the hell out of the leveling. In my experience is does nothing but bring people togheter and give you motivation for wanting to play alot during the first day of release. Saying that its mostly people that abuses game flaws to get the achivements is just bullshit, the majority of people that get it deserves it, the people who gets it through abuse of game mechanics is the minority!<br />
<br />
EDIT: <br />
I had planned to sub again just to gear up for the expansion release to get the leveling experience again and perhaps keep playing if it felt good again, but I having seen that they've removed this small part of the game that cost them nothing, I lost so much of the passion that had started up within me again. <br />
This is a bullshit move from Blizzard. I dont understand why they cant see that they absolutely need top players to make casuals more motivated. Having players to look up to is just a good thing. While not everyone will agree that they ever looked up to a player, I atleast definitely used to do that and strived to become a better player before I got into the very high end of the game.</div></div><hr />
