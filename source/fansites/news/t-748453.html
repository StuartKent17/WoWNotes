Epic crafted items in Cataclysm - Updated 
The first batch of crafted epic items was released when the NDA was lifted, due to some technical issues it was ... difficult to get the new ones. This is now fixed and I should have a couple of interesting previews for you in the next few days. (or you can spoil my fun and lurk on the latest additions but not everything is listed there)

Alchemy<br />
Apparently, Alchemists will finally get another epic stone in Cataclysm. That's also where you realize how useful Mastery Bonus is, the item is just great for everyone. <br />

Additional raids before Cataclysm<br />
There are no plans for any additional raids before Cataclysm ships. With that said, there will be at least one major patch leading up to Cataclysm with a lot of core features and framework being added for the new expansion for players to explore. There will also be various limited-time events to set the tone for the release of Cataclysm. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435455975/running-icc-for-possibly-2-3-more-months/))<br />

Making Soul Shards &quot;exciting&quot;<br />
That is still the goal, but we don't think just hooking up a big +damage buff or spell is going to feel that way. It will just be done on cooldown without some kind of situational requirement for doing so. We haven't given up on the idea at all, but it's not a trivial one to resolve.

<br />
3 Prismatic gems ATM give 102 AGI, that's 42 more than non-JC's.<br />
<br />
The new gems only give 67 agi each, that's still only 201 AGI total. About 140 more than using WoTLK's normal blue gems. <br />
<br />
Engineers get TWO 132 of the same stat weight (like mastery and hit)<br />

<br />
EDIT: Well if you click on the item itself, the stats are still the old ones, but the tooltips when you just hover them are actually cataclysm stats (w/o spellpower).<br />
So that got me confused a bit.</div></div><hr />

I think I read somewhere that the ores/bars from that quest were being changed to different ones and not being shared with that. I forget the names, though. The new ore has &quot;ingot&quot; in its name, which I'm sure clears it up a lot.</div></div><hr />

I really hate all these simplified stats. I really liked it when the average chest piece has so many different stats, like stamina, strength, dodge, defense, parry, expertise, etc. Sometimes fewer, sometimes more. Now it's just stamina+strength+dodge, and if you're lucky it has hit or mastery too.</div></div><hr />

Ah, but don't forget about reforging. Sure, it's not huge, but if you want a whole bunch of different stats, you can mix some things around to get an extra one. The possibilities for customization is actually quite large.<br />

<br />
3 Prismatic gems ATM give 102 AGI, that's 42 more than non-JC's.<br />
<br />
The new gems only give 67 agi each, that's still only 201 AGI total. About 140 more than using WoTLK's normal blue gems. <br />
<br />
Engineers get TWO 132 of the same stat weight (like mastery and hit)<br />
<br />
Seems like these are normal epic gems and not JC only gems<br />
<br />
That's a good observation. Generally, Cata stats are 250% the size of WotLK stats. Blue gems which gave 16 stats in wotlk will have their equivalents give 40 stats (16x2.5 = 40) and so on. This goes across the board and makes sense also in that the starting epic iLevel used to be 200 in WotLK and seems to be 359 in Cata, an increase of roughly 160 iLevels is in the same ballpark of meaning &quot;stats are about 2.5 times bigger&quot;.<br />
<br />
In that logic, the new JC only epic gems &quot;should&quot; be 2.5 times 34 (=85) (the stats of the Dragon's Eye gems), but they turn out to be only 67. We can expect the &quot;normal&quot; epic gems to be 2.5x20 = 50, so the total JC bonus in Cata seems to end up, for 3 Chimera Eye JC only gems:<br />
<br />
3 x (67 - 50) = 51<br />
<br />
Which is only marginally smaller than the current 42. Certainly not the expected 2.5 x 42 = 105 that we would have expected if JC bonus grew proportinally to alkl other stats.s</div></div><hr />

A little, but half the reason that an epic was Epic was that less people had them. If they're just as common as greens then that's just not Epic.<br />
<br />
After WotLK I don't think blizzard can ever go back to that model but we may just have to accept that. Epics will be Epic for the first tier but once the second tier of raiding comes out that'll be over.</div></div><hr />

It's never been about the text color of an item but how rare it is or how difficult it is to get. This isn't the same for everyone but personally an item feels far less Epic to me if it was easy to get or if everyone can get it. I've no problem with people looking cool in WoW but if there's no exclusively-awesome items to aim for I get bored with content quicker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the color and/or looks of an item were the two easy ways to tell if someone was epic.<br />
<br />
If all the gear is the same text color, and it all looks roughly the same, then no one can really tell he was an epic raider or not. It's just the 10-20 item level difference and heroic tag on loot that shows it; neither of which seems to have hit home with many people.<br />
<br />
I can't blame them too much, because epic... is... well... *ques TotalBiscuit podcast intro* EPPPPPPIIIIIIICCCC!!!<br />
<br />
It's mostly nostalgia, really, but it'd be cool to see it back, since it really shouldn't take much to change color text. (I know, the color actually affects stats, but it can't be that hard to unlink them, or just create new colors that look the same as the previous, with equal modifiers, but with both blue and purple text.)</div></div><hr />

It's a stat that improves your talent bonuses. For example, Beast Mastery Hunters get a bonus that makes their pets do a certain +% more damage. That % is increased through Mastery rating. Or so they say anyway.<br />

They're simply &quot;generic&quot; helms that allow customization through the cogwheel and hydraulic pump.<br />
<br />
Compare the engineering plate helm to the BS plate chest. (There's going to be a difference in stats due to the different slots; but thats ok).<br />
<br />
Both have the same stats (341 STR, 512 STAM) while the BS chest has 228 CRIT and 228 MAST. The engineering helm has a meta (as all helms of that level should) but the extra engineering slots are just to allow engineers to fine-tune the item to their specific needs. It's a little bit more flexibility... but I bet they are giving up rare power when compared to a helm drop of a similar level.<br />
<br />
Also; where is the STR based cloak? :( No love?<br />

I can already see tanks rolling Alchemy, just to get their hands on the Lifebound Alchemist Stone.<br />

There will be better trinkets for tanks; I assume. Though that stone looks downright nasty... 400+ stam and 233 mastery? Seems overkill for entry level...</div></div><hr />

Look at the goggles, now at your helm, now back at the goggles... your helm is not the goggles, but it could smell like the goggles... wait... I mean, the goggles don't have any stats other than str/agi/int and stam, the 132 cogs/hydraulics are NOT 100% added stats, they likely end up being better than the average helm, but not by 264 itemization points... the goggles are basically a blank slate, and the engineering sockets let you customize the extra stats you want, one size fits all.<br />

This goes across the board and makes sense also in that the starting epic iLevel used to be 200 in WotLK and seems to be 359 in Cata, an increase of roughly 160 iLevels is in the same ballpark of meaning &quot;stats are about 2.5 times bigger&quot;.<br />
<br />
In that logic, the new JC only epic gems &quot;should&quot; be 2.5 times 34 (=85) (the stats of the Dragon's Eye gems), but they turn out to be only 67. We can expect the &quot;normal&quot; epic gems to be 2.5x20 = 50, so the total JC bonus in Cata seems to end up, for 3 Chimera Eye JC only gems:<br />
<br />
3 x (67 - 50) = 51<br />
<br />
Which is only marginally smaller than the current 42. Certainly not the expected 2.5 x 42 = 105 that we would have expected if JC bonus grew proportinally to alkl other stats.s<br />
<br />
If you think back to WotLK launch, there were no &quot;regular purple gems&quot; just blues, and purple JC gems.  Later (during Ulduar) when epic regular gems were introduced, JC gems were boosted to compensate (as well as all other professions), it wouldn't surprise me if they did the same thing again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you please stop referring to Cogwheels and Hydralic Pumps as &quot;gems&quot;... it confuses the poor noobs who think they can fit those in normal gem sockets.<br />
<br />
&quot;they are socketable with Cogwheels and Hydralic Pumps, that appear on engineered item speciality sockets.&quot; would be much better wording.<br />
<br />
<br />
The pumps and wheels are meant to allow engineers flexibility in choosing secondary stats for their craftable items.<br />
<br />

It's not Vanilla, or BC, or Wrath anymore. The game changes and the majority of us will adapt and continue to play, no matter what they change. I do like epics feeling...epic to get, but I welcome all changes. If the game was still like vanilla, we'd complain that it's boring and needs some refreshing change. The small details isn't what makes the game fun to me, it's the experience of playing in an evolving world with others. The color of the text of my items doesn't make a difference to me.<br />
<br />
This is coming from someone that just got back from a long break. I came back to see regular flying mounts moving faster, lvl 20 mounts, dungeon finder, the ability to be geared for newest raid through just heroic 5-mans. And many other things that &quot;dumbed&quot; the game down, none of that bothers me one bit. Hardcore players can do their thing with hard modes, removing buff, ect. But casual players (which I am now) can seill see stuff and enjoy it.<br />
<br />
The problem is that people, generally the hardcore players...want to be able to exclude people. They need to see stuff or receive things (titles, gear, mounts) that nobody else can. Otherwise, how will they feel better than everyone? Why do you think so many people complained when a raid that they've had cleared for months (with the buff, most likely) got easier with the buff increase to 30%. The buff is fine, just until it's high enough for you to clear it. &quot;But don't increase the buff further to help anyone else, because I already did it with 15% months ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
The game changed drastically. If you don't like the direction it's going, you're free to leave. It's never going to be your beloved Vanilla again. Change is scary to WoW players, unless that change helps their particular class or their situation. &quot;OMG too hard, give me a dmg buff!&quot;. &quot;OK, I finally got it. No more changes! Stop helping these scrubs!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mean to be an ass, but have you been paying attention at all? This is a huge big thing they've been talking about (and tweaking) for months and months, so explaining it in a simple post will be a tad difficult. Here goes my best attempt:<br />
<br />
When you select a class and spec you get some &quot;Masteries&quot; based off of what class and spec you are chose. So a Fire Mage might get +crit and +fire damage, an Assassination Rogue might get +Poison Damage and +Melee Damage, and Disc Priest might get +Shield bonuses, etc. You can look at the talent calculators to see what the bonus is for each class/spec. I don't really remember them all, and they're all changing as beta progresses. The idea is that Masteries make you better at what you're already good at. <br />
<br />
So for each point that you put into talents in your primary spec (so essentially every other level until 56, I think) your Mastery increases. On top of that, you can increase your Mastery with the &quot;Mastery&quot; gear stat. So if you have, lets say, four Mutilate Rogues: one level 10, one level 56 (or whenever you max out your 31 points in your main spec) and two level 80, it'll work like this: <br />
<br />
The first rogue has, let's say, +10% poison damage because he has chosen Assassination. The second Rogue has, let's say, +20% poison damage because he's maxed out his Assassination talents. The third Rogue has no gear with Mastery on it (he hasn't collected any new gear yet) so he STILL has +20% poison damage. It hasn't changed since he spent his 31st point in Assassination. The fourth Rogue has gathered some mastery gear. He has (I'm completely making these numbers up by the way) 400 Mastery, which gives him a 5% Mastery Bonus. So now he has +25% poison damage.<br />
<br />
The idea here is that Mastery is a stat that Blizzard can put on items, and whatever your character is already good at, he'll do better. So they cut down on some of the &quot;Dammit Blizz, ArP is terrible for Assassination Rogues, why does all the leather in ICC have ArP?&quot; or the converse &quot;Man, ArP is all I want as a Combat Rogue, why can't all the leather in ICC have ArP?&quot; Put Mastery on stuff and everybody likes it, because it helps everyone do what they do. If they design the Mastery bonuses right, it'll be the one stat that every class/spec wants.<br />
<br />
There's a ton stuff in Blue posts, comments, and MMOChamp posts about all of this. What's good, what's bad, who's mastery is OP or sucks. Look around. It's probably the single biggest stat and character development change they've made. I don't know how you missed it.</div></div><hr />

Well i do recall seeing &quot;Don't expect them to be easy to craft.&quot; in the post at least for the blacksmithing epic items, so i can probably assume some of the other epics will not simply be a walk in the park to craft and obtain~ But i do feel WoW will never go back to the accomplishment of Epicness in vanilla though~~</div></div><hr />

I don't mean to be an ass... but pretty sure they scrubbed the &quot;increases with talents&quot; portion of mastery when they decided to do the &quot;select your spec&quot; at level 10. Your master % at level 10 will be the same mastery % until you start getting Mastery rating. It still scales with level, because its a percentage, and that's what percentages do, they scale.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya because grinding for literally weeks to make Robe of the Archmage was sooo much fun, let's go back to that pleas.(/s)<br />
<br />
Blizzard has a habit of over doing things one way or the other(I call them the arrested development team), you know like an emo teenager, the kind that complains about what other people are doing or getting.<br />
<br />
I'm betting it'll be a monstrous pain in the ass requiring many instance/raid runs to get the mats and I'm also betting that your kind will be bitching about that as well.</div></div><hr />

Let's use that junky polearm for example. Remember how fast the titansteel bonecrusher got replaced? That's how fast that junk polearm will get replaced. It'll be replaced, or have something nearly equivalent in a Heroic Dungeon. In fact, the stats are garbage on it as is, and unless there's some other weapon with STR or whatever on it instead, most likely there will be a 2H weapon with proper stats on it in said dungeons to replace it with. Next, tack on that the mat requirements for said weapon will probably be ridiculous, it just doesn't look that attractive.<br />
<br />
They need to give Blacksmiths something special again, not just sockets. They need to have proper BOP weapons/armor. Or, allow them to add a socket onto a few more items. My god is engineering getting a lot of love so far. Not to mention I'm sure they'll have a craftable mount or two again. All that unnecessary bitching paid off for the kids it seems, Blizzard listened.<br />

This looks amazing! im excited<br />
<br />
There it is again, &quot;amazing&quot;. That word has such little value anymore due to overuse on things that do not deserve such IMHO. There's nothing too special here, outside of a few engineering things that look &quot;OK&quot;, it's very run-of-the-mill for an expansion as compared to the past, nothing new. Every single time Blizzard shows off a recolored/recycled model, there's always a few &quot;amazing&quot; people, and they depreciated the value of said word to the point where &quot;amazing = alright&quot;.<br />
<br />
I mean, look at the stuff shown off. Some stuff is poorly itemized already. Most of the stuff is just more recycled thoughts from Wrath. &quot;Highlight item, Copy item, Paste item, multiply stats by 2.5, yep my work for today is done. Time to go look at the new statue we just got in the bathroom.&quot; - Blizzard developer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that trinket comes in a STR flavor it will completely dismantle Greatness for ret paladins.<br />
<br />
Even without strenght; if the mastery conversion ratio is similar to STR than the alchemy trinket may on its own merit be better than greatness anyways. (Pop a STR gem in there. Voila.) Mastery, based on the math, is the single greatest stat for ret paladins due to the scaling nature of holy damage with inquisition. Now. If seals damage is reduced even further than this could change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other than the novelty of seeing such big numbers on the items, this doesn't mean too much considering how everything is scaling in Cata, plus who knows the final values of stats such as &quot;spell power&quot; anymore. Though, it is interesting to see such high numbers sometimes.<br />
<br />
I mean, Shadowmourne, a Legendary item, has 1600 top end dmg, while that junk craftable polearm has 2800. Things just scale like mad every expansion. This time, hopefully people can't do the first raid in T10 gear, and need to gear up appropriately first.</div></div><hr />

For some things it takes weeks. So you're working your butt off to get the crafted and it is called welfare?<br />
<br />
From wiki:<br />
&quot;Welfare or welfare work consists of actions or procedures &#8212; especially on the part of governments and institutions &#8212; striving to promote the basic well-being of individuals in need.&quot;<br />
<br />
People don't sit around and beg for these epics. They are WORKING for them.<br />
<br />
If anything, raid epics are welfare. You have to depend on other people to get them. Read that description from wiki again. You certainly can't solo your way to those epics can you? Most entrepreneurs in the world are individuals or very small groups of people.<br />
<br />
So, there you have it. Epics from raiding are the new welfare epics because you have to depend on others to get them. ;)<br />

<br />
Informative, but unfortunately dead wrong.<br />
<br />
A - Mastery stat has NEVER increased the passive masteries<br />
B - Masteries don't work like that anymore.<br />
<br />
Now, you get a couple certain bonuses for picking a tree (you get this when you put your first point in the tree): I.E. Fire mage gets +crit and +fire damage (I think) for putting their first point in fire at 10.<br />
<br />
Each tree has one unique &quot;mastery&quot; ability to the tree, which will take affect just about when you get the 31st point in the tree. Arms Warrior unique mastery ability is much like the old sword specialization, a percent chance to proc an extra weapon swing. Let's say at base it is 5% chance. Now, with mastery rating, that percentage will increase. Perhaps ~100 mastery rating = 1% better chance to proc the extra swing.<br />
<br />
Some other class/spec unique abilities:<br />
<br />
Ele Shaman get elemental overload (proc a 2nd identical spell) - mastery rating increases the chance to proc<br />
Fire mages get an extra ignite effect - mastery rating increases the amount of spell damage that becomes the dot</div></div><hr />

This is MMO-champion, land of the stubborn. Neither side of the argument will change anyone's minds, it's a cesspool of stupidity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you think about it. This jump in iLVL really isn't that big. a lvl 75 axe has iLVL 162. and that's a green so, 5 levels up and epic (200) = + 38 iLVL'S. not too much.<br />
Considering this is an expansion and the jump is from starting epic to starting epic. an increase of iLVL from 200 &gt; 359 isn't that much. <br />
<br />
The power on random greens in cata at lvl 81 will be astounding</div></div><hr />

Seems pretty big to me. The jump from BC to WotLK was from 115 to 200. Roughly half the jump here.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but they rolled spell hit and melee hit together into one stat a while back. I really hope they aren't making them two stats again /facepalm</div></div><hr />
