Holy Wrath Hotfix<br />
We just deployed a hotfix to modify Holy Wrath so this spell has the same diminishing return mechanics that other player stun spells and abilities currently have. This will prevent Undead creatures that we wish to be susceptible to stun from being permanently stunned if you include enough Paladins in your raid who then rotate their Holy Wrath casts.<br />
<br />
This will affect the difficulty of Anub'arak, but we didn't want the &quot;right way&quot; to defeat this fight to involve bringing five Paladins who glyphed their Holy Wrath spell. <br />
<br />
Trial of the Grand Crusader Difficulty Hotfix<br />
We just hotfixed the following changes to the Trial of the Grand Crusader (aka Heroic mode).<br />
<br />
Northrend Beasts<br />
Fixed a bug where the flag that prevents a creature from gaining attack speed after a parry was inadvertently left off Gormok the Impaler. This bug is fixed in normal mode as well.<br />
Increased the amount of time players have to defeat the encounter before Icehowl berserks.<br />
You have an extra half second to get out of the way of a very angry charging Yeti. Players with high ping rejoice.<br />
Icehowl will become tauntable. (This particular element isn't hotfixed quite yet, but should be shortly).<br />
<br />
Lord Jaraxxus<br />
Infernal Eruption will now spawn an additional Felflame Infernal the instant the eruption occurs.<br />
Nether Portal now summons Mistresses of Pain slightly more often. <br />
<br />
Recent In-Game Fixes - September 2009 - 09/08<br />
09/08/09<br />
<br />
For both 10- and 25-player heroic modes, the Felflame Infernals and Mistresses of Pain will spawn a little quicker in the Lord Jaraxxus encounter.<br />
Gormok the Impaler no longer attacks quickly after a parry in any difficulty.<br />
Icehowl takes a bit longer to enter the arena in 10- and 25-player Heroic modes.<br />
Icehowl takes longer to berserk in both 10- and 25-player Heroic modes.<br />
Relentless Gladiator ranged weapons damage has been adjusted to the appropriate value for their item level.<br />
Holy Wrath now has diminishing returns and shares this with all other stuns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The beserk timer on Icehowl is fairly well tuned, but the nerf to the charge was needed, there was just too little margin for error for an instant &quot;you lose&quot; ability, especially for players who don't have super low ping.</div></div><hr />

K, that's nice and all, but how about we wait more than a week to see how many people can down it. I doubt more than 1% even got to use all their 50 attempts (mine didn't and we raid for 12 hours a week). Nerfing something like Yogg 0 needed to be done, but only after there was plenty of time for people to try to down it.<br />
<br />
A week is hardly enough time to decide if it was overtuned or not.</div></div><hr />

You don't see Paragon using it because Paragon cut off their DPS meter after 15 players.<br />

Beasts isn't hard, it's a gear check, plain and simple. Right now, the only guilds downing it are the ones that've farmed Ulduar hard mode ilvl 239 loot for months. Now the gate's open for the ones that have only had one month instead of 2-3 to farm Ulduar hard.<br />

Personal i would less likely appluad the dude who says &quot; Impossible. We need to farm weeks first&quot; then him who say &quot; ..but what if we try 4 of class x, with specc/glyph y, wouldnt that work on mechanic z?&quot;<br />

<br />
Which is the subtle line between an exploit and a unintended behavior. But most people mash them together. Bliz just wants to avoid any mechanic/behavior that applies a specific raid class comp to win. (aside from teh standard dps/healer/tank ratios)<br />
<br />
The people who tried this did not exploit per say, Bliz just decided it's not how they want it done. No harm no fowl. Just gotta rethink things now.</div></div><hr />

Look, I'm not whining about this nerf (I was expecting it, if not more), but I think that is a weak argument - I thought that the point of having normal and hard modes, 10 and 25 man, was that everyone got to 'see all the content', but that the hardest modes were still there for those who wanted a really good challenge. *</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
At least its just your 2set.. and not your 4set like DKS =(<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow, I love how they hotfix all this new crap and yet the PVP vendor in SW still doesn't sell the low level PVP items.<br />
<br />
<br />
So they hotfix some bosses and holy wrath but they can't hotfix rogue's precision so it applies to axes?<br />
<br />
Listen to yourselves, you whining brats. Blizzard is hotfixing new raid content to address bugs and tune the encounters to the intended difficulty, and so they should be obliged to fix every one of your little problems, too?<br />
<br />
The fact that we have here four different problems that people want hotfixed - none of them directly relevant to the difficulty of raid encounters - should be a good clue as to why Blizzard aren't hotfixing them.<br />
<br />
Now suck it up and wait for the amazingly frequent patches that will probably address your concerns, and be thankful that Blizzard has changed its development philosophy so that you don't have to wait half a year like you might've had to in the past.<br />
<br />
PS The thing with Gormok is to do with increased attack speed after the mob parries. It used to be that parries would reset the boss's swing timer, so the boss might hit a tank, parrying an attack from that tank at the same time, and then hit the tank again pretty much instantly, so if you got unlucky with avoidance you could be eating crazy damage in no time at all. This used to be a major problem with bosses such as Gruul.</div></div><hr />

Are you f*cking kidding me? You know what kind of dps loss ret paladins are looking at for a bugged 2-set bonus? The 2-set was supposed to give Righteous Vengeance a rough 40% crit chance, at the moment it's roughly 4%. And you're telling me that it's hard for them to change ONE value?<br />
<br />
Blizzard sure as hell was quick to fix the insane Reckoning-bomb in vanilla, but to make things work right it for the paladin class, especially retribution, takes them months or even years. You even have any idea how long retribution paladins waited before their PvE was brought up to par with other dps classes?<br />

<br />
<br />
we started off using a 2 tank rotation<br />
and this was a problem, or if a paladin got a monkey. however we were still regularly beating p1<br />
<br />
now we use 3.<br />
each tank takes 2 stacks. taunt to next.<br />
then maybe a drood tank takes 3 at the end with cd's popped.<br />
<br />
then on the transition get the pala tank to BoP himself, then get holy/ret palas to bop the other 2 tanks to clear the debuff heading into p2</div></div><hr />

Beasts isn't hard, it's a gear check, plain and simple. Right now, the only guilds downing it are the ones that've farmed Ulduar hard mode ilvl 239 loot for months. Now the gate's open for the ones that have only had one month instead of 2-3 to farm Ulduar hard.<br />
<br />
Nice to see Jaraxxus getting a bit of a buff, though. Was pretty funny how few guilds there are out there who've downed Beasts but not Jaraxxus.<br />
<br />
I hate to break this to you this but Beasts was being killed by &quot;good&quot; guilds not because of their item level but because of their skill. <br />
<br />
Regarding the nerfs I don't mind at all we killed it last week. The nerfs also suggest that Blizzard didn't think enough guilds had killed the first week so maybe Icecrown is closer than we think.<br />
<br />
<br />

Thats why you make the tanks which arn't tanking stand at the side of the boss. Obviously now not an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hard modes should be hard<br />
Blizzard probably has some kind of strategy like the top 1000 guilds should be able to kill a certain boss by a certain date. Even bosses like Yogg 0 probably have some kind of plan and even after all the nerfs and gear improvments &lt;200 guilds have killed it. Probably they're thinking &quot;Ranked 9000 should be able to kill Hodir by 01/9/2009&quot;, &quot;Ranked 7000 Yogg 4 by 01/9/2009&quot; and nerf the content as required.<br />
<br />
I've learned to accept that giving &quot;free&quot; gear isn't really that bad. Even if they ended up mailing a full set of the new tier set to everyone at each new patch I would have superior gear because I would be enchanting and gemming it correctly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bring the player not the class<br />
<br />
They are not refering to hardmodes with this quote. Easy modes are perfectly viable with any setup. I've been in the best guilds and the worst guilds and its usually purely down to their motivation to succeed at the game. You can't expect Joe Casual to have read up on the tactics, used a spreadsheet on his new item to find out of ArP or Agility gives a greater marginal benefit. They just want their item and they want it now.</div></div><hr />

Set bonuses are not a priority of Blizzard's, especially the T9 stuff, and, I would imagine, especially not at the cost of sorting out the new raid content.<br />
<br />
Does the set bonus being bugged break your class? Are your raid leaders more likely to take some other class because of it? More importantly, does the set bonus bug have any material impact on the execution of the new raid encounters (a la Reckoning Bomb)? Because it's pretty clear to me that was what this round of hotfixing was aimed at dealing with. Not random class complaints such as ret's 2-set or the PvP vendor's stocklist.<br />
<br />
I mean, how would they choose what to do? It's not just changing one value for the ret 2-set, it's fixing those vendors, those rogue talents, that DK 4-set and god knows what else all you whiners want to complain about. But that wasn't what they wanted to achieve at this point; they wanted to fix the way the new raid encounters worked.</div></div><hr />

I intended that some &quot;cool&quot; guy would say that. But we didnt clear the Ulduar Hardmodes with people have &quot;bad connections&quot;. This thought is more than stupid, sorry.<br />
It just kicks people every and every time at (for example) 20 secs after p1 engages. Its from raid day to raid day different whom get kicked... So obviously not a connection problem.</div></div><hr />

When does using a skill become an exploit?<br />
<br />
Stars used 1 lock and 2 stones. Is that an exploit? If Paragon used 1 lock and 15 stones, is that an exploit? Or is it if you use 1 lock and 7 stones? Where's the limit?<br />
<br />
Stars used 5 paladins to chain stun adds. Paragon only had 4, you can't get 100% uptime with that. When does it become an exploit? At 100%? 90%? 50%? Are guilds supposed to simulate DR by overlapping stuns? Not use them at all?</div></div><hr />

I don't know how many times it has to be said. If Blizzard were looking at hotfixing random issues, where do they start? Sure, you want the ret 2-set fixed, rogues want their talent fixed, twinks want their lowbie PvP vendor fixed - everyone wants something!<br />
<br />
So Blizzard has decided its priority is the new raid content (does this actually surprise anyone?), and has hotfixed it to address bugs and tuning issues. Yes, there are a huge number of other tiny problems with the game, but Blizzard has to focus its resources on what it decides is most important. Don't like it? Go and design and implement your own MMO and make sure your paladin 2-set works as intended.</div></div><hr />

Agree with eoy, this hotfix makes p3 hard, really hard... Really looking forward seeing who has true skill needed to defeat Anub without this &quot;bug&quot;... I'm calling it a bug because it's pretty obvious it was in fact a bug (Kidney shot is the only stun not on DR I believe) - If Paragon and Stars claim this is not a bug they are full of bullshit. That being said I don't blame them for using it and I would never catagorize it as an exploit - much worse stuff has been done to secure world firsts in the past :P</div></div><hr />

If that many guilds could do it without that much 258 gear, and gear still leaning towards the 8th tier, then the encounter is fine.<br />
Instead of nerfing the enrage timer let gear push the guilds who can't pull out the dps towards beating the time required to kill icehowl. Since Jaraxxus and Faction champions are a joke compared to beasts I expect whines about Twins soon, closely followed by a nerf.</div></div><hr />

Raid composition should be completely random, and yet should they be able to kill the boss, as long as they have the skills and the gear (and of course the proper talents for their respective role). Blizzard didn't intend using Holy Wrath as THE way of killing the boss, and therefore preventing people from thinking so.</div></div><hr />

If you even have tried Trial of the Grand Crusader on 25man, you'd realize that every boost of dps that you can get your hands on is essential. If the raid dps is not on time, you'll wipe simply because you'll fall behind and i.e Icehowl will hit his enrage timer and wipe the raid. So yes, considering that blizzard is a multi-million-dollar-company who probably earns more money than either of us can think of - I *do* expect them to fix things quicker than they do. They've shown that they can in the past, and frankly I don't get it how they can make obvious mistakes and fix them two months later. <br />
<br />
And don't tell me that &quot;they don't have time&quot; or &quot;those are just trivial&quot; issues. Some issues that have been creeping up for the ret spec for instance have been quite gamebreaking in gameplay for the spec/class. For instance: Righteous Vengeance *still* breaks Repentance when the developers clearly stated that this would be fixed (can't find the source, somewhere on the WoW forums I believe it was). They promised that fix months ago, and still have nothing to show for.<br />

<br />
I still think we're talking at cross-purposes. Let me see if I can be a bit more clear.<br />
<br />
These hotfixes are explicitly to address the way that the new raid content works (and I note that one of these fixes is aimed at Icehowl - is it a coincidence that this is precisely the enrage timer you provide as an example of being especially unforgiving?). Unless Blizzard is balancing the encounters around set bonuses, or the low-level PvP vendors, or rogues using axes, is it any surprise that they haven't hotfixed those issues?<br />
<br />
If Blizzard feels that paladins are not doing enough DPS in raids, do you really think they're going to address it with a set bonus? If that were the case, then yes, I'd agree that they should be hotfixing it if that set bonus was not working as intended, but that is a pretty far-fetched scenario.<br />
<br />
I am not saying that your complaints aren't legitimate - I'm sure it's very frustrating to feel that your class is gimped and isn't getting the attention you feel it deserves. But that's a separate issue to these hotfixed changes, and I do not think that people are justified in stamping their feet about problems with their class because Blizzard is trying to iron out the problems with its new raid encounters.<br />
<br />
And incidentally, I think it's very naive to say that Blizzard chooses to let all the bugs and other issues with the game design go unaddressed, as if they have a simple &quot;shall we fix it or shall we not&quot; decision to make. In order to fix everything that's wrong with the game, Blizzard would need vast resources. They don't have them. There's always pressure to do more with less in any business, and Blizzard is no exception. I bet they have to make painful decisions about the issues that get developer / coding attention. I very much doubt that anyone at Blizzard would choose to let known bugs go unfixed. It's not like they hate paladins or anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what is the only way of obtaining better dps, more survivability, or greater healing for those &quot;good&quot; players who perform flawlessly skill-wise? That`s right... better gear. <br />
<br />
So I don`t see the flaw in the argument of the person you answered to. Gear check fight is still a gear check fight, it requires players to be properly prepared in that regard. It doesn`t take away the skill required. But you can`t just have one and not the other.</div></div><hr />

Week 1 - Northrend Beasts made available for everyone.<br />

Week 3 - Faction Champions made available for everyone.<br />
Week 4 - Twin Val'kyrs made available for everyone.<br />
Week 5 - Anub'arak made available for everyone.<br />
Week 6 - Northrend Beasts (HC) made available for everyone.<br />
Week 7 - ?<br />
Week 8 - ?<br />

<br />
Raid composition should be completely random, and yet should they be able to kill the boss, as long as they have the skills and the gear (and of course the proper talents for their respective role). Blizzard didn't intend using Holy Wrath as THE way of killing the boss, and therefore preventing people from thinking so.<br />
This.<br />
This is what people need to realize.</div></div><hr />

This is the hardmode yeah? Blizzards way of saying &quot;Now when you finally dont have anyone dc'ing on your try, the encounter must be bugged, lets despawn the shit&quot;?<br />

<br />
I mean, if gathering up a whole bunch of paladin for holy wrath spamming to make phase 3 easy was correct, then most guilds who don't have the luxury of getting alot of paladins (Although ever since wotlk, Paladins basically resurfaced in large numbers, so i highly doubt this) or start replacing people in unusual numbers to kill a boss because X class has a clear advantage over Classes Y.<br />
<br />
This doesn't mean that Blizzard is out to destroy the paladin class, they did enough of that during original and Burning Crusade. I am pretty sure they are finally trying to make amends.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malediction</div><div class="date">2009-09-09, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exploiting ? <br />
<br />
When it´s in the game. it´s in the game. That simpel.<br />
This is a game and we all should be laughing at &quot;exploits&quot; and try to use it ! It´s smart and clever.<br />
I don´t see any bad behavior in that.<br />
<br />
It´s not like a god mode or trainer you can install. IT´s in the game !<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
People like you seem to be confusing hack and exploit. A hack is doing something not possible in the game. An exploit it taking advantage of something already there. How can you exploit something that is not in the game? They used a mechanic that obviously wasn't intended by blizzard and it was nerfed. Exploit doesn't always mean cheating, and that's where most people get confused. Its simply taking advantage of the system (with varying degrees of &quot;cheapness&quot;). Blizzard can define whatever they want as an exploit, and take whatever actions they want against it. Usually resulting in a nerf (in this case), and in rare cases even a ban for those involved. It all depends on how &quot;bad&quot; Blizzard perceives the exploit to be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ogemaniac</div><div class="date">2009-09-09, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am surprised they buffed Jaraxxus. At least in tens, we found him by far the hardest of the first four bosses. We spent about 8 tries to down him last week (as opposed to 2, 1 and 2 for the other three bosses before AN), and struggled mightily to down him last night. He seems to remind me of Sarth+3D in tens, where what you really need is 11 people. Jaraxxus does too much damage (and with too many silences and range issues) to consistently handle with two healers, yet only five dps makes it iffy for U25/10hm-geared players to down the portals.<br />
<br />
Why the hell weren't the twins buffed? Having them be such cupcakes in heroic is sickening.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS:) Blizzard, you missed such a GREAT opportunity in the twins heroic fight. If healers could only heal people of the same color, you would have made one of the most unique and exciting healer fights in the game.</div></div><hr />

I hate to break this to you this [sic] but Beasts is a gear check, saying &quot;skill&quot; is needed for beasts is incredibly stupid.<br />
<br />
A) Can you move out of fire? - Check<br />
B) Can you switch to adds (1-2, not 10+)? - Check<br />
C) When you get a debuff can you run to a person in the raid? - Check<br />
D) Can you dodge a boss who clearly states he's running at you? - Check<br />
<br />
Grats on your free loot</div></div><hr />

<br />
* Infernal Eruption will now spawn an additional Felflame Infernal the instant the eruption occurs.<br />
* Nether Portal now summons Mistresses of Pain slightly more often. <br />
<br />
That seems more like a buff there than a nerf<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly. What these rampaging retards don’t understand is these are FIXES.<br />
<br />
Please, by all means present me with threads were scores of Casuals (Who, incase you didn’t know, are the majority and deserve the most attention) demanding nerfs like this or gtfo lame hardcore living in your mums basement. Raiding too easy? Ok show me all your Ulduar achievements kk?</div></div><hr />

That was a bit confusing, I used both American English and British English. Well in the UK we hardly ever use the word basement, more like “Cellar”. I watch too much American TV…<br />
<br />
Anyhow I got another thing to add- Sitting behind a keyboard pressing buttons is not hard work.<br />
You are insulting every single man and woman who gets up every day and contributes to society. Were as you are contributing to a fake, imaginary society called an online game. It's &quot;Hard&quot; within the context of a game, but that doesn't matter for shit.</div></div><hr />
