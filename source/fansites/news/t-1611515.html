<br />
Patch 6.0.2 - Soloing Old Content Hotfix<br />
Earlier today the damage you do in older content was reduced as part of the base health reduction of older creatures. Unfortunately this also means that players are killing old bosses slower than they were on the first day of the patch, and this is intended. <br />
Legacy raid soloing changed drastically over night. Doing roughly 1/3rd the damage I was yesterday. Bug?<br />
Not a bug. It's a change accompanying a large reduction in health to all mobs in that level range. (Watcher (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522805451272888321))<br />
So the net effect is nothing changed?<br />
Net effect is probably somewhat lower damage in practice. Maybe 20% longer kill times, closer to pre-6.0 (Watcher (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522770179617718274))<br />
Festergut 25HC took me ~40seconds last night. I wiped on LK after about 5 minutes and he wasn't even 50%. You sure 20% is right?<br />
The problem is that last night you had the lower multiplier but not yet the lower health pools. Should be sorted out now. (Watcher (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522805451272888321))<br />
Has this been implemented yet? I still seem to only do my normal dmg, no multiplier. The mobs clearly have had their HP reduced, but my damage is the same outside as it is in a legacy raid.<br />
By &quot;outside&quot; do you mean outside in Northrend? Because that's all Wrath content, all gets the same treatment. (Watcher (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522852011201417216))<br />
<br />
Question: was there a hotfix to soloing old content?<br />
Yes, along with health/damage changes to all old mobs. The target was preserving the same pacing as 5.4.8, maybe a bit faster. (Watcher (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522881940223823872))<br />
<br />
Initially lots of fun for tons of people bored with the game and now.. lots of disappointment....again! Why such high priority on getting this &quot;fixed&quot; when there are so many other pressing issues in game now?<br />
It was part of the overall health/damage adjustment which I'd say was absolutely a pressing issue. If you could solo something in 5.4 or earlier, but cannot today, please let us know. (Watcher (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522846503233011714))<br />
I agree with many others, no point in old content being hard to solo, please revert.<br />
I think it'd be fine if no gold dropped and items had no value beyond transmog. But I think that'd bring its own problems. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/522869263405965312))<br />
so are you saying the revert *is* because gold was too easy to obtain?<br />
Not at all. It changed because the goal was preserving 5.4.8 pacing, and we got the numbers wrong at first. (Watcher (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522883296150056960))<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.0.2 Class Balance<br />
It looks like more class balance changes are headed our way, along with the previously mentioned tweaks (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13087818929?page=32#636).<br />
Just to keep everyone updated, we're progressing on the first big round of balance tuning changes. Coming in the new couple days will be adjustments to Assassination, Subtlety, Fury, Protection Warrior, All Death Knights, All Monks, All Mages, All Hunters, Shadow, Protection Paladins, Retribution, Guardian, Feral, Affliction, Demonology. Lots of number changes. To set expectations, our general strategy will be to nerf the couple OP specs (Fire, Fury, Demon), and buff the others to be competitive. Slight correction to that: A few others are coming down a tiny bit too, but those changes were already announced in my beta forum post.<br />
<br />
When re-balancing hunters could you maybe try to do it so the no.1 pet class actually does more damage with a pet than without?<br />
That's actually one of the biggest changes coming for hunters; pets were significantly underperforming, especially non-BM. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/522899321252237313))<br />
<br />
Am I to expect more hunter buffs soon considering what Celestalon said or is the hotfix today literally it?<br />
Today's hotfixes to damage are not it. Much more coming soon (trying for tomorrow but that may be tight). (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/522936822368714752))<br />

Blasted Lands Quest Rewards<br />
If you did the Blasted Lands quests before rewards were hotfixed in, keep being patient, as a solution is on the way!<br />
There is a 'solution' coming for this, folks.<br />

Not at liberty to divulge anything else, but they are working on something.<br />

Patch 6.0.2 Honor Gains<br />
Okay, few updates and some more info:<br />
<br />
At level 100, Skirmishes and Battlegrounds will award Strongboxes as the primary reward mechanic. You'll get some Honor from a win, but the contents of the Strongbox will be what you're really interested in. Those are obviously not available at level 90, which is why PvP gearing feels slow right now.<br />
<br />
That said, we agree that 18 Honor is too low as a base value for a Skirmish win. We're going to bump that up to 36. That amount will still increase based on how long a match goes, starting at 45 honor past 1 minute and increasing from there. Again, keep in mind that we want shorter matches to give more Honor per time spent, so that players don't feel obligated to drag out Skirmishes for better rewards.<br />
<br />
As to why it's not a higher number (&quot;this gear won't matter in a few weeks&quot;), there's a few key points to keep in mind. First off, there's the relationship between Skirmishes and Battlegrounds. Battlegrounds take longer and often have longer queues, which makes them a much larger personal investment to participate in. We want to make sure that extra personal investment feels worthwhile, so we're tuning Skirmish and Battleground rewards so that you earn slightly more Honor per time spent in a Battleground than you would in a Skirmish. If an average Battleground takes 15 minutes, and an average Skirmish only takes 2 or 3, the Battleground should reward significantly more Honor.<br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind that there's no weekly cap on Honor gains. It's okay for a rated Arena match to reward 180 Conquest points, because after you get your 10 wins (or reach your catch-up cap), that's it for the week. You might earn Honor a little slower, but you could earn your entire Honor set in just a few days if you really wanted to.<br />
<br />
Finally, we don't want to set unrealistic expectations for Warlords and level 100 PvP. We're okay with letting players gear a little bit faster right now in preparation for Warlords, but we don't want you to feel like you've had the rug pulled out from under you once the expansion launches and you start gearing at level 100. We want Skirmishes and Battlegrounds to feel rewarding in the interim period, but we don't want them to be some kind of loot piñata either. <br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
I get were not supposed to trust simcraft. But its useful when pointing out talents like Necrotic Plague are a dps loss to take<br />
Yep, absolutely. We do listen to that feedback. I'd just like to caution against taking the SimC spec DPS rankings as gospel. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/521389202022625280))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Is ilvl 700+ PvE gear going to be scaled down in PVP?? I havent heard anything about this at all.<br />
Yes it is scaled down in instance PvP and Ashran to 690. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/521348563201044481))<br />
that ceiling will increase each season (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/521348629106155520))<br />
isn't 690 the ilvl pvp gear increases to in instances as well? If so, pve gear will be bis till full pvp geared<br />
You're assuming people will have full mythic gear before conquest gear? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/521363157710020608))<br />
are there any measures to prevent pve pieces from being bis in pvp, even after full conquest?<br />
I'm primarily concerned about something being extremely better than some min/max BiS list. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/521385737166393344))<br />
if there's a chance someone can get a pair of bracers that gives them a small bit more crit, I'm not concerned. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/521385939470266368))<br />
will pve set bonuses work in pvp settings? And yeah min/max is no biggy if it's small. Just don't want cata again<br />
PvE set bonuses do not work in Arenas or Battlegrounds. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/521388311051374592))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Currently you can buy a 20% XP potion BEFORE building Barracks, which makes you have to farm rares/chests for Garrison Resources.<br />
I could see wanting to do this on my alt, perhaps? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/520371235562086401))<br />

<br />
Especially given that some classes(priests) have it a lot harder than others(dk, druids) anyway. So if it means that DKs may need 20% longer to kill content...it means as well that shadows are going to wipe 3 tiers lower in content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't want to or mean to sound like an elitist but COME ON. Its three weeks until everything changes, why is anyone crying about level 90 class/spec weighting... smh<br />
<br />
And people whining about solo stuff when they know full well in three weeks time and the extra 10 lvls are there it will be even easier... i don't even... hell maybe they don't know. But the fact that it even has to be addressed is mind boggling...</div></div><hr />

So could u please change that back aswell so i dont enjoy it as much ok, it is so much better for the community when u want other players to help u with jousting instead of doing it yourself ok.</div></div><hr />

Guess his point could be something like although u ofc need tanks for current raid content why would u have to play one to be able to do old content? And for a moment there it looked like blizz was saying &quot;you're right, we agree, all classes should be able to do old content&quot;</div></div><hr />

It's just my personal opinion, as Earthquake almost haven't been used at all until now when it's gotten a bit stronger in 6.0.2.

Only reason that some people playing the AH get extremely rich is because they either have no life and sit on there 24/7, their customers are morons for buying overpriced crap, or a mix of both. Doing old raids have no competition in it. And even if you can't solo, bring along a friend and the gold drops get increased so everyone gets the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all blizz never said they were going to make cata raids super easy to do they only said we would STILL be able to solo old content. The key word being &quot;still&quot; as in if you weren't able to do before you &quot;still&quot; can't do it. If you want to 1-2 shot everything there is always Vanilla / BC raids. <br />
<br />
If soloing cata raids with huge numbers is your thing be patient for a 4-5 weeks more and do your thing at lvl 100 and stop crying.<br />
<br />
P.S.: I am also very sad about the nerf to old raids but I am not crying about it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redecle</div><div class="date">2014-10-17, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Typical..<br />
At the same time Blizzard sort of condemns soloing, very easy soloing at least, but they still understand that it's one more thing to keep people playing the game.<br />
It feels like do just enough changes to keep subs up, but if it gets too easy and enjoyable, instant nerf and hotfix must ensue.<br />
The first impressions were great, the new UBRS as new content past ninety was difficult, but at the same time LK25HC was so easy it was fun to do.<br />
Much like lvl60 Molten Core at lvl80 or 85. But no have to care so much making even soloing harder.<br />
<br />
Well it wasn't that hard after this hotfit, still killed LK25HC in the early morning, but it was much more time consuming than the night before.<br />
Pretty much the only risk of dying was inside the Frostmourne, the exploding spirits can kill you easily, took me to below 5% hp when all the rest of LK's abilities were able to take you to 70% max.<br />
So not that big of a change, but yet for a player who basically came back solely to solo old instances in WoD, it's still a flag of warning.<br />
<br />
Absolutely loved the ability to two shot HC BWD 300 million bosses in the beta with a mage and yet again having the extra difficulty WoD dungeons in comparison.<br />
For new content you'd actually have to be aware and pay attention, a lot, but you could still relax with old content and not be on the nerve 100% of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't you think it would be more usable if it was channelable? <br />
<br />
Maybe they could remove the stun effect and add a slow effect to it instead, since the stun effect would be kind off OP in PvP if it was a channeling ability.<br />
<br />
Maybe they could remove the cooldown on it, and fix so that there can only be one Earthquake up at a time, so that you can adjust to the situation.<br />
<br />
Either way, I dislike the mechanic just because of the long cast and that theres a cooldown on it. (I don't wanna go &quot;Echo&quot; just to have a chance to be able to cast it again)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But this old raid thing. There's a reason I saw almost my entire friend's list having fun looking for transmog gear the past 2 days. :) The gold you make from this, you can make elsewhere as well... old content is essentially a 'free' daily/weekly system for blizz once they aren't current. Aka free time-consuming content for the players. I think it -should- be accessible, both to keep us busy but also because it's fun to have destinations where you don't have to form larger groups. <br />
<br />
This is all assuming you're high level of course, they should be appropriate at the level you're at. Which is the main weirdness going on right now.</div></div><hr />

Oh really? See, it's yet another last-minute change like removing the Thunder King scenario that seems to revolve around gold drops-- they don't care about transmog or mounts, just all of a sudden the amount of gold dropped is this huge problem so no one is allowed to solo stuff.<br />
<br />
Why not leave this content/soloing ability in but reduce the gold drops???</div></div><hr />

<br />
This!<br />
It's not like people are, at least most solo players aren't asking current MoP or Wod group content to be soloable.<br />
Of course there are pro soloers who do stuff like Blood DKs soloing current content, which should be challenging, really challenging. <br />
But not seriously your average players going experiencing old raids which are still blocked by things.<br />
<br />
For example most players were able to solo Vanilla raids in Wotlk gear.<br />
Same thing that elevated to TBC raids in Cata.<br />
But then something happened, for example me who had no problem soloing TBC raids during Cata, has been stone walling anything past Naxx in MoP.<br />
And this is not some specific class or spec, any class. Ulduar has been doable by some classes, but not all not even close and this is in last tier MoP gear.<br />
Thing i've wanted to do all during MoP, that was just now possible after 6.0.2. Hotfix didn't change that too much, WotLK still is possible.<br />
So as i see it, the possibility to solo legacy raids in the 2nd last expansion, which has been a good rule of thumb until MoP.<br />
Which would essentially mean that Cata should be soloable at 100.. That remains to be seen, currently it's not after hotfix, but hopefully in WoD it will be.<br />
Beta at one stage at least suggested it, but it wasn't the final tune done. Even the bosses were still in their original HP, when they are now nerfed to nearly half.</div></div><hr />

Instead I could have done old content on alts, but it got nerfed before I had the chance. And with it back to as before, although it's doable I've done it 5.4 difficulty for a year and not interested in that.<br />
<br />
Granted, I can just wait a couple months until my alts are 100 and in theory they should be easy as before this nerf. But...I haven't preordered and have been on the fence, and each of these things makes me wonder more about wod. I'm a healer and healing doesn't feel real fun now either. I wouldn't even say more difficult (excluding the obvious bugs like fire 2 shotting, just normal healing) seems less interesting than ~5.x at least to me.</div></div><hr />

Not true. Firelands 10 man Normal post damage nerf I was collecting roughly 60-80g per boss, which is about 500g for a few minutes of fun. I would do 25 but even in i581 dps the damage taken is a little too high. This amount was derived from gold dropped + gear and embers that went to the vendor.<br />
<br />
Given that the casual gold income in the future is heavily going to rely on you messing with the Garrisons, these are going to become a standard for those looking to make some easy coin without farting with dozens of dailies per day.<br />
<br />
I could care about the 'mogs' or mounts, I just want something to smash and to collect a decent amount of gold for my trouble. Hanging around the AH all day is not my idea of fun, I'm a multi-millionaire in the game and I still love getting my hands dirty and collecting coin myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, actually... true. 500g fora few minutes of fun? You can easily get more than that from the AH in half the ammount of time it takes to clear FL. Plus, you can only do it once per week. 500g per week doesn't seem like that much of a big deal. Also, regardless of how many people you have in the raid, the gold multiplies. So if you bring a friend, they will ALSO get 60-80g per boss. There's no fix there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MelancholyRose</div><div class="date">2014-10-28, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When they &quot;hotfixed&quot; the problem, I noticed a bit of a change... but I'm still able to full clear Firelands on my tank with no problems. I'm still able to down Ultraxion in no time flat without taking any huge damage. Before 6.0, I was pretty unsuccessful in soloing even part of the raids. I honestly don't care how long it takes me to kill bosses. Soloing old content is fun to do. Besides, I'll be level 100 soon and can go back to it. I don't see why we absolutely have to do it all right this second. I waited this long to solo bosses (and I now can). I can wait a little longer to do it even better.<br />
<br />
Blizzard also mentioned transmog gear as being valuable drops from the raids. I both agree and disagree. It's not like you can sell it. And if you want transmog gear... I don't see how making it easier to get it is such a big deal. It's to make your own gear look like other gear. Why do they make that out to be like it's on par with getting mounts and pets?<br />
<br />
What baffles me most, though, is the whole &quot;staying in 5.4.8.&quot; Um... why? Isn't that patch over? Aren't we about to venture into a new expansion? What the hell do they mean by keeping it in 5.4.8, other than &quot;We want you to struggle really hard for stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Other than those to lackluster excuses for the hotfix, it's really not as extreme as it sounds and/or feels. If you can solo a raid you couldn't before 6.0, you're still better off than you were before. Like myself. I'm just glad I'm able to do it at all.<br />
<br />
Oh and my gear is really not that great, either.</div></div><hr />
