Patch 3.3 Buff/Debuff Management Clarifications<br />
There isn't a hard and fast rule for what goes into the box. We tried to go through the list of everything and make judgement calls. Very spammy things that you are grateful for but don't need to be reminded of constantly (say Replenishment) go in the box. Long-term buffs go into the box with a couple of exceptions. Things with relatively short ranges, like say totems or paladin auras, stay out of the box because you need to know if you move out of range of them. Things that are very core to your class, like Shadowform, paladin seals or warrior stances, stay out of the box. Inner Fire stays out because it has charges. Things like Inspiration and Heroism that might actually alter your behavior stay out. Anything related to a specific encounter will stay out of the box. If in doubt, we left it out.<br />
<br />
The other new option, the castable debuffs, is a way to just see &quot;your stuff&quot; on a target, especially a raid boss. If you want to see your Corruption and CoA and not every lock's dots, it works well for that. It does not work well for debuffs that share the same exclusive category, like say Mangle and Trauma. That functionality is something we'd like to add in the future. If you're a raid leader, it's not going to let you see if all of the critical debuffs are being applied. But if you aren't a raid leader, don't have a lot of fancy mods to monitor such things, and just want to make sure your DK diseases are still up, it's great for that.<br />
<br />
We find both new tools to be really useful, but they default to off, so we wanted to make sure players didn't miss them on the PTR while there was still some time to iterate on the design. <br />

No Quel'delar for Tanks<br />
We don't feel there is a need for it? We aimed to make sure that every class had something to gain from the Quel'Delar series, but that doesn't mean every spec of every class. Could a tank use the one handed dps version of Quel'Delar? Yes, it may give them more threat. Is this ideal for surviving while tanking? No, but there are other items available for that.

Deathbringer Saurfang Issues on PTRs<br />
The dodge and crit issues will be fixed in a new build, the higher values of those are a quirk of a setting we used on him.<br />
<br />
It's just the Blood Beasts that have the AE damage reduction aura, you should be able to damage Saurfang just fine with Whirlwind and similar effects. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/21038226210-deathbringer-saurfang--feedback-nov-12.html))<br />

Emblems of Frost Plate Tanking Chest Bug<br />
If you are talking about a certain badge chest, there is no block on that item. It has bonus armor, expertise and defense. [...] I think in this case it's actually a bug. We create some items by cloning old items and sometimes the old stuff doesn't get correctly removed.

Warlock Threat<br />
There is nothing to warlock spells that make them cause more threat than a similar spell by say a mage. The exception are spells like Searing Pain that specifically state that they generate increased threat. That issue is from a (possibly antiquated) design where the lock might need to pull off of their pet to save its life while soloing.<br />
<br />
In general, it's not a good strategy to compare your spells to other classes. They are different for a reason, which is namely that we want different classes to play differently. One of the first arguments we tune out is &quot;The only class who...&quot;. Our response to that is usually: Good! <br />
<br />
If you feel like you have threat issues, those are totally valid to discuss. I would do so without saying &quot;But this other class has a better spell.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21035173936-warlock-threat-part-2.html))<br />

Heroic Strike<br />
We have become pretty dissatisfied with the on-next swing mechanic. Come Cataclysm, we'd love to get rid of all of them. Obviously that will necessitate some pretty significant changes in how warriors generate threat or do damage (unlike Maul or Rune Strike, Heroic Strike gets a lot of use outside of tanking), which makes it too risky a change for 3.3. We think some of the other ideas like toggling the ability are also risky in the sense that they might require a lot of iteration to feel right, or worse, might mess up threat generation or damage dealt.<br />
<br />
The original design of HS as a tanking tool wasn't that you replace every white swing with a Heroic Strike. You did it when you wanted to burn off rage. These days tanks (and increasingly dps warriors too) are rarely rage starved beyond perhaps the first few seconds of the fight. That turns Heroic Strike into a button you always push.<br />
<br />
A couple of other ideas we have considered, as someone above referenced, were making Heroic Strike do more threat the more rage you have but also spend more rage. Another is that you somehow go into &quot;high rage mode&quot; at which point everything costs double but hits harder. This would work for dps warriors too. Those are just ideas at this point, not announcements. Please don't tell us in a few weeks that you were promised these changes for 3.3. :( (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/21043886521-why-no-heroic-strike-fix.html))</div></div><hr />

Tempest keep's drop - ashes of alar was never removed either.<br />
The difference here, is that you can skip most mobs to get to it, but get only a small 2-3% drop chance.<br />
<br />
With yogg, you need to clear past a good large number of mobs to reach it, and then still only one head drops. Even if it has a 100% chance to do so.</div></div><hr />

I don't believe so. He was bugged in that he was ignoring player expertise (dodging and parrying at inordinate rates) and ignoring player defense (critting tanks above def cap). Those dodges would account for some melee dps loss, at least, but the fight is definitely a free for all zerg. <br />

you get that 100% dmg buff (Essence of the Vampyre Queen) wich you need to spread to another raid-member every 50 seconds or you will get mindcontroled, and if you are mindcontroled you are immune to any form of cc.<br />
this also is the soft-enrage for the encounter, you have to spread the buff to not get mced, but you cant spread it to allready infected raidmembers, so after some time there are no valid targets left and you will become mindcontroled.<br />
<br />
with the 100% buff 12,4k dps is not that big, but yes kurusaki does pull some really good dps ;)</div></div><hr />

Agreed. It is sad to see that they are not even trying anymore.<br />
Same with the tanking enchant.. They did not want tanks to have one tanking enchant everyone chooses so instead they gave us none.<br />

how does one &quot;spread&quot; the buff to another? stand on top of them when it expires?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
when the buff (actually its a debuff) expires you get a new debuff that lasts 10 seconds and you get a new ability (your actionbars fade out and you only have that special ability), you then have to use that ability to &quot;bite&quot; another raidmember. you can also see that in the video at ~2:05. if you dont bite someone in the 10 seconds you get mindcontroled, if you bite someone you and your target get the 100% dmg debuff again for 50 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spoiler (I guess):<br />
<br />
Watching the start of the DeathBringer Saurfang video, I am glad to see that High Overlord Saurfang (Saurfang the Elder) is not dead, he is just strangled and floating in the air. The sound files on YouTube made it sound like he was struck down, but apparently it is him just getting choked. So it will be interesting to see how this plays out and why he is not involved in Cata since Garrosh seems to be in charge. Maybe he goes in exile after his son's passing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The buff players get during the fight and spreading it to each other makes the 63 million seem like much less. 100% more damage kinda helps that.</div></div><hr />

Ok, apparently you don't look at omen enough, The talent that is suppose to reduce threat does not reduce threat, its doesn't work. have you ever watched a Arcane mages threat it is no where near the top ever .... Now, watch a warlock the common spec 0/13/58 every fight i have to ask for a sal, or bop, shatter is already on CD bro, so there for you all should either fix the talent or our 1 AND ONLY threat drop ability, hell make it a 2 min CD for all i care but the way it is, it's stupid. Mage - 2 different ways to save themselves from dieing or getting threat. Hunter - Complete threat drop. DK - dmg reduction. Rouge - Vanish. Paladin - Bubble. Shaman - don't do enough threat. Warriors are one of the only classes with no threat drop, how ever there threat isn't to bad on alot of the fights because of moving purposes. There is my explanation on Destructive Reach and Soul Shatter.</div></div><hr />

No Quel'delar for Tanks<br />
We don't feel there is a need for it? We aimed to make sure that every class had something to gain from the Quel'Delar series, but that doesn't mean every spec of every class. Could a tank use the one handed dps version of Quel'Delar? Yes, it may give them more threat. Is this ideal for surviving while tanking? No, but there are other items available for that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21043886736-queldelar-weapons.html))<br />
<br />
...and the award for dumbest reasoning by a blue poster goes to...<br />
<br />
Seriously that is the worst excuse for not making a tanking weapon and a dagger caster dps weapon I have ever heard.<br />
<br />
IÂ´m so disapointed now. First no dala rings for tanks, now this with quel delar. I did the quest on the PTR today, and it was really entertaining and fun, but itÂ´s useless for a warri or pala tank, or even for a dual wielding dk. Thats really stupid.<br />
<br />
Of course itÂ´s not the only weapon in 3.3. BUT itÂ´s ilvl 251 and you donÂ´t even need to go to ICC. The other classes get this &quot;Boost&quot; but not we as tanks. We need to go to ICC 10man to get an equal ilvl Weapon.<br />
<br />
So damn disappointing . GZ Blizz you did it. :'( :'(</div></div><hr />

i could have understand and ignore that they dont add a tanking weapon because i ll hit ICC25 and ICC25 Hard modes by not having effected with this but their reasoning is one of worst so far. tank with 1 hander dps weapon, just laughed at it. then whats the point of having tank gear anyways just make a full dps set then make tanks able to tank with that gear and get rid of the extra work making the tank gear ;D</div></div><hr />

umm no...<br />
the only worthwhile Tank Weapon in ToC is in ToGc 10 because the one that drops off anub toc10 is just sucks.<br />

How on earth is it an 'unnecessary change' when people are genuinely concerned about developing carpel tunnel from having to mash the same button, pretty much regardless of what else they're doing, for hours on end. It's not well designed, it's not fun and it's not rewarding.<br />
<br />
Christ, it's like you people all think Blizzard genuinely does this shit to piss you off. They're trying to improve a clunky outdated mechanic that went from being a nice rage-dump to being just mashed an entire raid, every raid, week in and week out.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't agree more with you. I think it's BS that they had the nerve to say that. I would say a fire mages spells have similar threat, however, they have many more ways to threat drop than a locks crappy talent (really 10%, come on... most other classes get a 30%-40% reduction) and soul shatter (who's CD is unrealistic for any halfway geared lock). I am a fairly geared lock, however not the most geared, yet in most fights I find myself having to soulshatter, get HoS, and vig, and stopping dps for a few seconds because of the threat issue that apparently doesn't exist or affect warlocks differently than any other class. In hindsight, sure the spells don't cause any more threat than comparable classes, but it's not an issue with the spells themselves, it's with the threat modifiers (talents) that screw locks over.. If Blizz would actually care to open their eyes they would realize it's not just locks that complaint about warlock threat... it's tanks and heals too.</div></div><hr />
