I got so excited about the bosses moving toward a set rotation... that I failed to read that was a 7.3 addition.<br />
<br />
Not sure why that's not just something they can fucking hotfix.</div></div><hr />

Can't be serious Nighthold loot, hopefully just a typo. Heroic Nighthold drops 880/890? Seems like just getting carried through LFR TOS would be more appealing to people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
7.3 will change the way they rotate (probably to a card draw model) which ofc means we will get Nithogg 10 weeks into 7.3 as the last world boss.</div></div><hr />

I would actually pay the devs a few bucks to really tell me what's the deal with not just making a rotation of 3 bosses per week? Their gear is underwhelming already, they aren't updating it and it's simply 860 so what's their reasoning behind this? hard coding? do they want me to fix it for them for free? lol</div></div><hr />

I quite like the update to SC 1, updated to work on modern systems, modern networking, on the BNet launcher. Generally just having it work.<br />
Can't wait for War3 to get the same treatment.</div></div><hr />

I would really love to know why they gave it the green light to begin with. You're going to tell me that NO ONE had the foresight to predict the issue(s) we are seeing? If that is true... no one on that team deserves to stay. I don't have a whole lot of tolerance for stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly, serious lack of vision, it's just driving me nuts trying to understand their way of thinking and I am usually very tolerant towards Blizz's decisions, the change for it code wise is probably one of the most basic ones from randomizing 1 bosses per week to 3, immersion wise it make sense for me to have more bosses out in the world, make it feel alive and full of dangerous creatures (even if you killed it for the week and get no loot anymore, it's just nice to fly around sometimes and see huge threatening bosses, not just the world being filled by trash weak mobs), it's clearly a design decision that they won't give a green light to make a change quickly and for the life of me I can't understand why.<br />
<br />
And as you said, let's say they lack vision and missed it, fine whatever stupid mistake, but why can't they give a proper solution that it's not just me, I have seen their twitter flooded with such suggestions like my own, usually yeah I understand their stance of not listening to playerbase regarding advise and feedback because there are many opinions and people love different things, but this one is definitely a no brainer.</div></div><hr />

Na'zak seems to be an RNG mid-week spawn boss. I don't think he has ever spawn on a weekly rotation cycle. I've only seen him spawn twice since launch.</div></div><hr />

if you have starcraft 2 ( i think it requires HotS at least) you can search for starcraft mass recall, a starcraft remake for starcraft 2</div></div><hr />

<br />
This, although to be honest I never really cared for them to remaster SC and SCbw. But that was 100% entirely due to the fact that the folks over on hive workshop had already created such a fantastically done remake in the SC2 editor (Seriously, they brought in the briefings, sounds, hell even the friggen cinematics, called MassRecall for any interested in looking into it). But I like this as well.<br />
<br />
Definitely eager for them to remaster wc3 as well; though I'll admit I'd be more than a little salty if they didn't remaster wc1 and 2 first.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Annnnnd didn't see the guy above me mentioned mass recall already- sorry lol. quick note though: They did a massive update adding all kinds of stuff after LotV launched- so need that now rather than hots.</div></div><hr />
