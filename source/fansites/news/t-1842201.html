Dev Interviews<br />
Game Guide (http://wow.game-guide.fr/21410-gamescom-2015-interview-wow) interviewed the developers and learned some more new details about Legion.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Pre-Expansion Invasion Event<br />
<br />
The invasion hits all of Azeroth, so we will see invasions in many different zones throughout the world. <br />
We are seeing new demons and engines of war that we have never seen before.<br />
There will be some period of time over weeks that Azeorth is being invaded and the various factions will decide how they are going to handle it. <br />
Players will have demon invasions they need to fight against, all leading up to the launch of the expansion. <br />
The Broken Shore will be part of this launch event.<br />
<br />
The developers can't talk about their favorite feature of Legion yet. They are still working on lots of super cool secret stuff!<br />
The team would love to do something with Karazhan. There is a lot of great lore there. There aren't any plans to announce yet, but the team is discussing what they can do with it.<br />
The team is not talking about doing a player or guild housing system right now.<br />
Having an Artifact weapon makes sense for this expansion. The weapons we have now aren't enough for us to even stand a chance against the invasion.<br />
Flying mounts feel awesome, so as much as the team wants players to explore the world from the ground, there needs to be a way to unlock flying later in the expansion.<br />
There are plans for itemization and having to share Leather loot between classes that the team isn't ready to talk about yet.<br />
Demon Hunters being able to see other players through walls is really cool and fits the class.<br />
The team isn't sure how matchmaking and the Prestige system will interact. They can't completely split people up by Prestige rank, as that would result in very long queue times.<br />
You didn't see more Horde than Alliance in Warlords, you saw more Orcs. Those Orcs were Iron Horde, not Horde. They were the enemy of everyone. We also saw both Horde and Alliance heroes, so there wasn't a huge disparity. Legion will have both Alliance and Horde heroes and stories. <br />

Gamescom Crowd Reaction<br />
Seriously I watched that developer interview.. on sunday and they tried to suggest that the german fans were really excited. I saw the live stream of the Legion reveal. There is no doubt that the gamescom crowd reacted as if they had just seen grass grow. There was no earth stattering roar. There was no Insanely loud reaction that required the developers to wait for the crowd to die down. Nope it was a tepid hmm I have to consider this. It was a we need more factual information to really get excited. And that is the general feeling from wow vets. Blizzard has a lot more to do before folks really get excited about Legion.<br />
Something interesting that I've noticed while at events is that video sometimes doesn't capture the vibe or how loud things really are. An example is BlizzCon. I've seen comments like &quot;why is the crowd so quiet&quot; when in fact it's incredibly loud actually at the event. <br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that not everyone there is a native English speaker (gamescom draws people from all over the world). A lot of people were most likely trying to take in the information and were reading the translated bits on the sides etc. And lastly... different culture = different means of expressing themselves. Don't judge by American standards.<br />
<br />
Yawning in another country means lets party and sneezing means you're hot.<br />
Yawning for people who have been at a large convention all day (remember it was much later in their day than ours) and waiting in large crowds to see a presentation (I think one man said he waited 6 hours) is a sign of being tired (generally speaking). Nothing more. I'm sure we've all yawned even in the midst of having fun. It's a physical response, not a cultural one.<br />
<br />
You don't have to cheer and be loud to be excited for something.<br />
<br />
What about the bored faces of the sweaty nerds? Even half the front row was snoozing.<br />
I already answered that to some extent. It was a long day at gamescom for them and what you may interpret as &quot;boredom&quot; may not be so. Unless you're in their heads, I don't think you can define their state of mind or even physical or psychological exhaustion.<br />
<br />
I think overall, people are reading way more into the crowd than they should be. How you personally feel about the expansion announcement shouldn't need to be reinforced by a crowd of strangers at a convention. Either you like what you saw and are personally excited, or you're apprehensive, or you just don't care. That's all an individual choice you get to make based on your own thoughts and experiences. <br />
<br />
I often think of the Monty Python scene where the character tells everyone they are all individuals and they parrot back, &quot;yes, we're all individuals.&quot; Ultimately, your enjoyment and excitement of the game comes down to you and your own personal choices. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/383189-gamescom-crowd-reaction-spoke-volumes/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18596061285?page=5#85))<br />

PvP Gear in Legion<br />
Honestly, there is a lot of information we are going to need to share on all of the upcoming changes and systems for Legion. We're just not ready right now to get any deeper in to the details. We are, however, keeping a close eye on questions and concerns people have on this and a variety of other things. I wouldn't worry too much though.<br />
<br />
Will the information be ready by Blizzcon?<br />
If I answer this one way or another, people will try to guess at dates. I know a trap when I see one!<br />
<br />
Ah wow, thank you for the reply! I'll be optimistic then, since you said not to worry :P (Now if only some of those no-longer-available PvP pieces would find their way back in, heheheh... Wishful thinking.)<br />
I'm not guaranteeing anything, but we like when people get specific about the items they think are missing and should be added. It helps us with identifying those items and making a choice as to whether they should be there or not.

Developer Communication<br />
well yall quit being so vague with info and give the players what they want and they wouldnt have to rage so hard<br />
We just announced a new expansion in development. And all people want to know is EVERYTHING.<br />
And if anything about what we've said changes at any point in the future = our heads on pikes. (CM_Zarhym (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/631261200823644164))<br />
well yalls track record on delivering is not the greatest<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Can you confirm whether or not the Corrupted Nest Guardian is always personal loot, even on Master Looter? Some confusion...<br />
It drops in accordance with whatever loot setting your group is using, but can be bonus rolled. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/629074654448095232))<br />
<br />
Can the felblood fish from tanaan have a level requirement? low level twinks are using them<br />
Yes! This will be fixed in 6.2.2. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/629076330546532352))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
I'm a game designer because I love making things for people to play and enjoy. It's the only reason I do it. Excited to share what's next. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/628792887862374400))<br />
The harsh reality being that the vast majority did not enjoy what you contributed, wonder when conclusions will be drawn?<br />
I will continue to do what I have done my whole life when things don't work out as well as I'd like. Learn and try again. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/628794746861785089))<br />
<br />
is this intended? being able to rid alliance mounts as horde in mercenary mode? http://t.co/xt80jLYBSM<br />
It's an outstanding bug (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/629081471433601024))<br />
<br />
hope random BG honor gearing will still be possible, I only BG &amp; quest/legacy content <br />
I think you'll be pleased (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/629327368419610626))<br />
<br />
Do artifacts work in pvp?<br />
Yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/629331791451566080))<br />
<br />
These are ideas for talents. Nothing final. Just ideas. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/629339943224131586))<br />
will these talents make EMFH finally not as strong. It appeared to show trinket for everyone at first tier<br />
I saw that too. Hmmmmm. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/629342101726232576))<br />
<br />
Do you see more PvE-oriented players (like myself!) finding it easier to slip into PvP with this system?<br />
Yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/629392720432205828))<br />
<br />
Talked to at blizzcon. He made a good point. To make PvP better the community needs to play ptr/beta more and give feedback!<br />
We are REALLY going to need people this time. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/629376909286187009))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
honest question: Do U think 1 year expansions R really worth it? So many missed opportunities in wod cause of this 1 year timeline<br />
Like many things, it's one of those &quot;is it worth it to provide a whole new world&quot; in what would previously have been an X.2 (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/629176244538445824))<br />
Lots, and lots, and lots of questions and feedback to be gained, hope if we ever get there, you will share w/us (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/629176381985796096))<br />
<br />
Could you ever see path of the titans coming back?<br />
An AA scheme isn't a bad idea, but it can't feel like 1% gains, needs to be focused. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/629178661015453697))<br />
<br />
Look at MoP, no one asked for that and MoP was amazing, wasnt a big fan on the asian influences but yeah<br />
MOP is a curious case, solid staying power through patches, dislike during it, love after it, much to reflect (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/629143287589289984))<br />
<br />
leveling wod wins. Overall feel... Wotlk wins<br />
Levelling WOD was amazing IMO, need to retain that bar. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/629160890718248960))<br />

You up all night to.. refresh MMO-Champ threads?<br />

This. What the actual fuck. There was almost zero customization. Yeah, you could choose where to place your buildings, up or down the hill..., put few ugly statues and choose your guards (and of course there was no &quot;guards from every race&quot;-option). I don't count those as a real customization. More like what colour of socks you use today?</div></div><hr />

I think they mean the actual feel of owning a piece of land and being a commander worked out well. I also think it felt cool. The actual max level gameplay and hollowness of the Garrison did not, and I think they aren't referring to that part.</div></div><hr />

I personally can't think i'm &quot;owning&quot; the land when someone just build stupid fountain there. Or did not level the hills. Aargh! I can't even live in a tower, my personal quarters are just some crappy room. It does not feel like i'm the owner, more like i've rented it... <br />
<br />

<br />
Atleast stop lying to yourselves please. <br />
<br />
<br />
Flying mounts feel awesome, so as much as the team wants players to explore the world from the ground, there needs to be a way to unlock flying later in the expansion.<br />
<br />
Also, not very happy about that being released later. Blizzard sure wants to extend flying ban for as long as they can.</div></div><hr />

As I said, the actual feel of it was good until players started to see how hollow it was. Why do you think many were so blinded with the awesomeness until they started too see through the cracks? I'm not saying it worked out well in the end, but that was after the facade came down.</div></div><hr />

It did worked out well. If you listened to the interview he said that they learned that it was very anti-social and broke profs but the owning-my-own-place thingie worked out pretty well. I think most of us kinda liked Garrisons first month or two. They dont mean Garrison were 100% well made but owning the place felt good. Class halls looks much better and it seems youll go there to pick up class-specific quest which sends you out to the world. Good stuff IMO.</div></div><hr />

While it's stupid that people latch onto this as some kind of proof that Legion looks bad, claiming European culture is like 'too polite' to cheer like us uncouth Americans is a terrible rebuttal.<br />

It did worked out well. If you listened to the interview he said that they learned that it was very anti-social and broke profs but the owning-my-own-place thingie worked out pretty well. I think most of us kinda liked Garrisons first month or two. They dont mean Garrison were 100% well made but owning the place felt good. Class halls looks much better and it seems youll go there to pick up class-specific quest which sends you out to the world. Good stuff IMO.<br />

<br />
I really don't understand why they have to be so single minded. What's wrong with players getting an Explore Broken Isles Achievement plus Isles Loremaster and then being given access to flying? They would've surely explored the Isles by that point and they would be able to fly by the end of it. It effectively kills two birds with one stone and meets both the team and players expectations. Heck if they really have to they could do a thing like Heavensward but instead of finding Aether Currents, we blown up some legion cannons, kill some harpies and take down Sea Witchs and Shamans that are causing storms in the zones preventing us from flying. Hell go even further and make it a serverwide effort like Isle of Thunder and players work through leveling and for a short while at Max level to unlock flying for all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just another example:<br />
I used to work for an international company and we had yearly employee surveys. A fixture in that was the question: &quot;Are you proud to work for &lt;company&gt;?&quot; Our American colleagues would invariably tick the &quot;yes, very&quot; box. In Europe the majority said 'No&quot;. If there was a box &quot;What are you f*ck*ng kidding me, it's a job&quot; we would have ticked that.<br />
<br />
The employees were humored and the European managers very frustrated when the company told them their bonus target was getting that score up in Europe. We're just not wired that way. A job is just that: a job.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2015-08-12, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About gamescom and &quot;excitement&quot; and people being bored. You have to understand that europeans are largely different in behaviour than americans. We don't get as easily excited in general and don't scream and shout like there's no tomorrow. <br />
<br />
We will, in general, smile, nod an approvement and keep listening. There are exceptions and all but that's pretty much how it is.<br />
<br />
I myself, while watching the stream, did just that, smiled, nodded and kept listening while thinking to myself &quot;fucking awesome!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Reminds me of a guy I used to work with, who left and went to go work for a company owned by Nestle, and had to do a big presentation to the Nestle bigwigs in Switzerland. Said he sweated the whole thing, nobody said a word in the room, no smiles, nods, nothing. Got through it all, and it was total silence. Then they all started tapping the table with their knuckles. <br />
<br />
Which is how they applaud there, in the corporate environment. I'm told it's an scientific/educational setting thing, too. <br />
<br />
It's the same thing as when rock bands first started going over to Japan, they didn't go nuts, they stayed seated during the songs, and politely clapped afterwards. It's not like that anymore, but in the 70's, it was a thing. I'm sure if Blizzard did a big reveal like this in Tokyo, the vibe would be completely different, too. <br />
<br />
I think the whole issue is silly, anyway, and even more silly that the CM is defending it as much as she is. It just highlights it more, there are better topics she could be responding to.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I really don't understand why they have to be so single minded.<br />
<br />
Developer ego. Pure and simple. They won't design with flying enabled. Ion made comments about how they had to learn to change their minds there, back in the Q&amp;A, I think the devs are a bunch of prima donnas who don't like being told what to do, and are incredibly pig headed when it comes to their decisions. <br />
<br />
Look at Holinka's comments today. Does that sound like someone who A. cares about what players think (I screwed up? Eh. I'll just keep plowing forward), and B. is capable of learning anything from experiences? <br />
<br />
The reveal shows some good stuff. But the more the devs talk, the more I feel we're getting more of the same that made WoD a pile of crap. They don't sound like they've learned anything, taken anything to heart, and are pig headedly driving into design decisions that will not be popular. They're holding up a bunch of nice shinies, but their statements are giving them away. <br />
<br />
In the last two days, they've already set the stage for another Tanaan, another form of the garrison, and a janky, messed up pvp game. <br />
<br />
Is it really so hard to find devs who listen to their customers and say &quot;That sounds like fun! Lets do it!&quot;, instead of a constant litany of &quot;It's too hard, it will take too long, we disagree, WE think&quot;, etc...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Talked to at blizzcon. He made a good point. To make PvP better the community needs to play ptr/beta more and give feedback!<br />
We are REALLY going to need people this time. (holinka)&quot;<br />

Likely 7.1 at least.

They're setting themselves up for another riot, another round of constant forum posts, and people quitting. They learned NOTHING from the flying debacle this year. Not a fucking thing. It's not a game breaker to announce NOW what they plan on doing, like &quot;We'll do it like WoD, we'll make flying enabled after the last raid tier, so everyone has played the content the way we want them too&quot;, but no, they're going to play games and be all cute and coy about when it's coming, and the anger from the first fuck up over flying hasn't even dissipated yet! <br />
<br />
I love it. This is the best free entertainment going. They're publicly taking aim at their own foot with a shotgun. <br />
<br />
There is NO reason to not tell people how it will work now. None. It can't be up for debate anymore internally, that's what got them into trouble this year, already. The on;y reason I can fathom is they don't want to admit it will come after the last raid tier, because they know they'll lose a lot of subs over that - and the only reason it's that way is because some of the devs are prima donnas who are clinging to some idiotic ideal for game design. <br />
<br />
Seriously, J. Allen Brack needs to start putting the fear of god into some of these devs. It's just a game. You're not saving lives. You get paid if flying is enabled from the start, or at the end. It's just embarrassing they're digging their heels in on this issue AGAIN, and setting up for the exact same response.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, the D3 crowd suffered several months (at least, I'm a bit fuzzy on actual timescale) of Trials while pretty much the entire community was screaming to get rid of them.

How is delaying flight till later in the Expansion playing it safe after WoD?</div></div><hr />

People take one quote from Blizzard and EAT IT ALIVE. Watch the fucking interview PLEEEEEASE. The &quot;garrison worked out well&quot; line is taken WAAAAAY out of context. They even refer to the anti-social aspect it gave and basically admitted it was an overall failure. <br />
<br />
On the flying bit, they said they were keeping the template of WoD which is basically a compromise to both sides of the argument (I'm personally on the no flying side)...there will be a middle ground. I can almost guarantee you they won't hold unlocking it until the end of the expansion, they know what backlash that got in WoD so I'd honestly expect it in 7.1, just an expectation of course. There's nothing wrong with doing the content in 7.0 (because at 110 you still got shit to do) and then unlocking it at the next major content patch. You guys will be fine. Eat a cookie.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jabilesblack</div><div class="date">2015-08-12, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of points to make, <br />
1: Stop taking everything literally, the garrison as a whole FAILED but being able to have your own piece of land, while very limited was cool &quot;at first&quot; thats what they meant by the idea behind it worked, <br />
<br />
2: The HUGE uproar about flying was IN FACT after they said flying was removed and never coming in NOT when they said it would be delayed, when draenor was launched and they said 6.1 noone had a problem with that then 6.1 came and it got pushed back to 6.2 then to 6.2.1 that was the problem not that we couldn't get it at first was that it was delayed and delayed then CANCELED then delayed again and will finally be added sometime in the next month, I'd bet my account that flying will be in on 7.1 after you've done all the content. <br />
<br />
3: This expansion if they deliver on all they have said at this announement, will be the BIGGEST amount of FAN requested items ever, people have wanted Artifact type weapons, Class Halls, Demon Hunters, Legion invasion Queen Azshara, Emerald Dream/Nightmare, and the Artifact leveling System AKA a rehashed path of the titans(or whatever the cut WOTLK advanced glyph system was called), I canceled my sub for the first time in 9 years in WoD and was utterly disappointed in WoD and everything blizzard did but renewed my sub after this announcement.<br />
<br />
4: The amount of people that are complaining about them not announcing or being more specific about stuff is understandable but at the same time I get it, THEY don't want to have a WoD 2.0 they don't want to announce the tons and tons of shit they WANT to work on then realize they can't do it or simply don't want to spend the time on it, and i get that point as well, be patient they had gameplay of almost 90% of the features they announced which is already better than the WoD announcement.<br />
<br />
So if you wanna keep bitching, its a free country, and it's the internet so do as you please but if you calm down and look at it from an outside point of view, wait till Blizzcon/BETA start, whichever comes first, then i guarantee you will get some definite facts.<br />
<br />
And before anyone jumps down my throat for this post, yes I'm a fan of blizzard have been for 16 years, so maybe I'm biased but ehh my biased wasn't enough to keep me in Garrisonville, and the fact that 9/10 Blizzard Employee's who do interviews admit that the garrison MECHANICS were an utter failure I have faith!</div></div><hr />

Also, not very happy about that being released later. Blizzard sure wants to extend flying ban for as long as they can.<br />
<br />
I agree.<br />
They should let us complete the achievement to unlock flying in 7.0 and not any later.<br />
<br />
Sure, the achievement can (and maybe should, even) be a lot of work to complete (but NO reputation grinding!), but it needs to be there at the beginning of the expansion.<br />
<br />
I get the whole idea of not being able to fly during levelling in order not to trivialize the content and the exploration, but there's no reason to ban flying up until it doesn't matter anymore (as it will be in WoD).<br />
<br />
An achievement that requires the following, would be reasonable:<br />
<br />
Fully explore all the maps<br />
Fully complete the zones (i.e. all the levelling and story quests)<br />
Fully complete all the bonus objectives<br />
Discover a reasonable amount of treasures<br />
Kill a reasonable amount of rares in each zone<br />
<br />
<br />
That should be fair and enough to grant us flying mounts.</div></div><hr />

Sounds great, that is a setup that requires completing basically everything that is ground based, thus achieving their goal. While at the same time being ENTIRELY user restricted. It is technically doable in 1 day, but depends on the effort put forward, without gating behind reputations or events they can intentionally slow down to draw it out.<br />
<br />
Too bad the entire plan is to draw things out, and that's why it isn't designed like that.</div></div><hr />

That's weird, cause I was at this announcement and the crowd seemed very excited. Mind you, the crowd stretched from the Blizzard stage all the way to the very end of Hall 7, which is quite big.<br />

A lot of people did seem somewhat tired including me. It's been a long day, it was VERY hot in Cologne that day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they were nicely integrated into the leveling process, the quests and achievements to unlock and upgrade buildings etc. For example the 'Inn' quests each day were fun and gave you a reason to run the dungeons for some nice rewards, the stables dailies rewarded you with a bunch of mounts, the barn allowed a nice income of bloods etc and the going round the world obtaining followers, leveling them up and unlocking further missions worked well. I like having my own space with the buildings I chose and my followers walking around saluting me every time I walk past.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, what didn't work out well was making them the ONLY source of end game content. If the Garrison was as is but complimented with other things out in the world, maybe gave you more reasons to run dungeons and do other outdoor content they would be regarded as a resounding success.</div></div><hr />

Also, 'Awesome!' is not the stop word over here that it is in the US. The level of excitement and loudness that Americans seem to show for every little thing, is only reached by Europeans when it concerns football/soccer and it serves as an outlet to keep calm and rational the rest of the time. I watched the stream and felt that the audience reacted exactly as I would, intently listening to what was said while gazing at the big screens with the awesome art.

<br />
While I agree that there is a good chance that young Germans react the same way to free stuff, a presentation is not necessarily what we react to in that way. I remember seeing the FFXV preview gameplay. The crowd wasn't going crazy, it was applauding. That's it.<br />
<br />
I kind of get why the community is angry, but I also get why Blizzard has choosen to keep a bite more on the quiet end of things until Blizzcon. It wouldn't be surprising if some of the features are still in major testing. After all we aren't even in Beta yet. Considering that Blizzard probably moved the timeline for an annoucnement to Gamescom away from Blizzcon to counter the subscription falling down, it's not surprising that some of the stuff isn't exactly finished yet. Announcing something now and then not delivering it could be more devastating to the game than waiting it out two or three more months until Blizzcon and talk about the safe stuff.<br />
<br />
I also think the comment about Garrison's was taken out of context. I think that Blizzard knows how much of a failure they were during the end of WoD. Yeah, they were nice at first, but slowly fell apart.<br />
<br />
During the &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; they talked about that anti-social aspect of the Garrison and how it was one of the downsides to the whole thing. Which is why the class halls will be a community feature and people will share the class hall. We will also get a new major city (although new here isn't quite right since an old one will return as a reworked and updated thing) to spend time at. It isn't the answer to all our problems. But it's a step on a long road into the right direction.<br />
<br />
I'm quite undecided where I am on this whole flying thing though. I'm an old school player and anti-flying. But I get the frustration by some players wo aren't used to doing everything on the ground. They should activate flying in 7.1. Not activating it at all could be fatal. But earning it shouldn't be that much of a problem.<br />
<br />
Otherwise I will look at Legion with a curios but careful attitude and wait for Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

MOP is a curious case ... dislike during it, love after it<br />

It may not be another literal garrison, but they always telegraph things like that. Like saying Tanaan was successful and cool and awesome and all that - to me that means they're designing more of the same.<br />

Exactly which is why all the fun factor of the abilities will have the fun sucked out of them. Someone(s) will complain that it's overpowered/unfair and Blizz will gladly remove them or heavily modify them without a second thought. Don't expect either of them to be in the game long. Also keep an eye on their overall mobility during the course of the beta. It will just be slowly chipped away.</div></div><hr />

What's wrong with players getting an Explore Broken Isles Achievement plus Isles Loremaster and then being given access to flying? They would've surely explored the Isles by that point and they would be able to fly by the end of it. It effectively kills two birds with one stone and meets both the team and players expectations. Heck if they really have to they could do a thing like Heavensward but instead of finding Aether Currents, we blown up some legion cannons, kill some harpies and take down Sea Witchs and Shamans that are causing storms in the zones preventing us from flying. Hell go even further and make it a serverwide effort like Isle of Thunder and players work through leveling and for a short while at Max level to unlock flying for all.<br />
<br />
Probably because I'd imagine, even when you hit max level, there'll be some ongoing quests that unlock over the weeks and such that would be trivialised by flying. I'd imagine completeing all those quests and properly completeing the content would be requirements of the achievement, same way the doing the campaign in Tanaan was part of it.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping its something that kind of goes patch by patch, so you complete the content in 7.0 and get the achieve then when the next content patch comes out flying is enabled (if you have the achieve) for all the old 7.0 stuff, but probably still restricted in whatever new zone was added with that patch. Then you can unlock flying in that new zone by completing all the content there, until the next content patch, etc. Would be a good compromise and a happy middle ground I reckon, not waiting too long for flying, but giving the content enough time to live and breathe before it gets trivialised.<br />

<br />
All that's saying is that people liked it while they were discovering the features. The first month or two was basically about getting your garrison to level 3, getting your buildings to level 3 through the achievement gates, doing the garrison campaign, filling your follower ranks and leveling them. That's all the garrison had to offer. One or two months of gameplay.<br />
<br />
Owning a piece of land was a successful idea, but it didn't exactly work out. How many times have people complained about the complete lack of customization? How many Horde character complained about the location of their piece of land? Frostfire Ridge sucks. It didn't feel good at all to own that Garrison. It's the only place on the whole continent that looks like a wasteland, and we're stuck there because that's the isolated home of Thrall's alternate-universe parents... <br />
<br />
Worst of all, we're stuck with some rudimentary Orc architecture. Apparently, the biting cold wasn't a good enough reason to have walls on most of the buildings. In Warspear, there are a lot of huts for different professions that retain the Orcish look while having a lot of influence from specific races. The Jewelcrafting place has lots of crystal decorations, red and gold banners, carpets and furniture that makes it obviously Elven. There are leathery huts with totems that makes it obviously Tauren. Dark, skull adorned ones with purple banners that are obviously Forsaken. Ones with tiki masks and shrunken heads to make them Trollish. Yet none of those made it to the garrison. Hell, they even went with a &quot;Spirit lodge&quot; instead of a Blood Elf mage tower for the portal hub.<br />
<br />
I have not played an Alliance character at all during WoD, so maybe their garrison is amazing. I can tell you that the Horde one does not feel good to own, though. It was a huge letdown on many aspects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Owning a piece of Draenor that you could customize worked out well. (The Garrison)&quot; Wut? Do they have their heads stuck so far up their asses they can say this? Don't they read any of the feedback? Don't get me wrong, I wholeheartedly agree that the technology and the idea was truly awesome, but how it was handled totally sucked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The team is not talking about doing a player or guild housing system right now.&quot; Huh? Isn't that what Garrisons basically are? Can't it be tweaked and made a side thing for players who want it with more and more customization added over time?<br />
<br />
&quot;Flying mounts feel awesome, so as much as the team wants players to explore the world from the ground, there needs to be a way to unlock flying later in the expansion.&quot; What the hell? That don't have a way of doing that yet? I thought it was going to follow WoD's pattern (which I'm cool with, expect the rep grinding. They could leave that out and my feelings wouldn't be hurt.). They're sounding wishy-washy like they did in WoD and I'm very concerned about that.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm overthinking this and jumping the gun here, but my trust in blizzard is at an all time low and I'm jaded. But I'm still going to hang on with a little faith, follow things and give it a chance (at this point in time anyway).</div></div><hr />

The Alliance garrison is much easier to look at and in a better landscape in SMV. All the buildings are human buildings, so it is kind of like Stormwind light. It also kind of seems smaller, I don't know if it actually is, but it seems that way. Less entrances too.

tbh, never seen such behavior in US cinemas. What I have seen though is Germans clapping when their flight lands...<br />
<br />
That's a European thing, congratulating the captain for a safe flight. Yeah, it's called being polite ;)<br />
However it's usually custom when crossing longer distances only - it is getting on my nerves when done in a 45 minutes trip from one city to another (thank the goddess this behavior happens rarely)</div></div><hr />

I also think it felt cool. The actual max level gameplay and hollowness of the Garrison did not, and I think they aren't referring to that part.<br />
<br />
But it didn't feel at all like ownership, or being a commander. The whole thing was fake and empty, a bunch of nobody NPCs calling me commander doesn't make it actually true, or fit the story. The idea that they think garrisons &quot;worked well&quot; is just pushing me further and further into the &quot;no buy&quot; column.</div></div><hr />

Well yawning just means your brain is lacking fresh air - and as far as I know you don't get much of that inside the venue ;)<br />

Demon Hunters being able to see other players through walls is really cool and fits the class.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And this is why seeing players through walls and double jumping will be either removed entirely or nerfed to near uselessness. I've played this game for six years and one thing I've learned about the churn of development and balance is whenever something is really cool or fun it will be taken away. That's why so many people claim Blizz is against fun. That's what they do.<br />
<br />
Or it'll last 10 secs and is on a 2 or 3 min. cooldown.</div></div><hr />

The garrison is the only reason I regretted faction switching my only Alliance character.<br />
I have not played a Horde character, so I'm only going by screenshots/video/streams I have seen of the Horde garrison. But I would agree that the Alliance garrison is much, much better. There are two things that the Horde garrison has better from what I've seen: one, the town hall is much smaller, which, yes, is a good thing. In the Horde garrison, it looks like you just walk up the steps and you're at the mission table. For the Alliance garrison, you have to go through two small pointless lobby rooms and then across a big room to reach the mission table. It's dumb.<br />
The second thing is that Frostfire Ridge has times of day. SMV is always nighttime. Which is cool for a bit, but it gets really gloomy after awhile. I'm quite tired of it. Of course, everyone is tired of their garrison in general, so that's not saying much.</div></div><hr />

You have to understand that europeans are largely different in behaviour than americans. We don't get as easily excited in general and don't scream and shout like there's no tomorrow. <br />
<br />
We will, in general, smile, nod an approvement and keep listening. There are exceptions and all but that's pretty much how it is.<br />
<br />
I myself, while watching the stream, did just that, smiled, nodded and kept listening while thinking to myself &quot;fucking awesome!&quot;.<br />
<br />
As an American I feel embarrassed that I have to correct this ridiculous statement. Europeans are THE most &quot;easily excited&quot; groups of people that have ever existed on this planet. Just crack open a history book for further information.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nairesha</div><div class="date">2015-08-13, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">4: The amount of people that are complaining about them not announcing or being more specific about stuff is understandable but at the same time I get it, THEY don't want to have a WoD 2.0 they don't want to announce the tons and tons of shit they WANT to work on then realize they can't do it or simply don't want to spend the time on it, and i get that point as well, be patient they had gameplay of almost 90% of the features they announced which is already better than the WoD announcement.<br />
<br />
This is btw. the American way. I've been working in the Gaming Industry for 10 years now, extremely close with US partners and can only groan whenever we have to discuss the way and timing of announcing stuff. Americans - even if you do not work in said industry - loves to be loud. The issue here is exactly this, always: promise first, sell hype like crazy and if you cannot hold - apologize.<br />
<br />
For the first time Blizzard, being Americans and used to this strategy get the finger - not only from the EU bit everyone. I so hope they really do it as you've written it: the EU way. Announcing and &quot;promising&quot; only &quot;set in stone&quot; stuff or giving mediocre glimpse. <br />
Of course it does not HYPE anyone as it usually does. On the other hand it will not blind anyone either and disappoint them in the end. I for one am happy with the announcement, will watch closely and reinstate my account with legion - w/o being overly hyped a.k.a disappointed.</div></div><hr />
