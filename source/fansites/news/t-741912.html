Muffins Presents Cataclysm Part 1: Kalimdor<br />
Muffins released a pretty nice video of the Beta servers and this should give you a pretty good idea of how things changed in Kalimdor after the Cataclysm. <br />

Increased HP on Cataclysm creatures<br />
The speed at which a green geared level 80 coming out of Northrend kills creatures in these zones is more in line with what we expect for and from combat times. Raid geared level 80s will still kill level 80 NPCs in under 10 seconds, but at least they will be able to fire off a few abilities before the creature is killed.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, upon completion of the first series of quests in Hyjal or Vashj'ir, quest geared level 80 from Northrend should see a significant jump in power due to quest reward itemization. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262766074/upcoming-level-and-zone-changes/))<br />
<br />
Optional and Situational Talents<br />
Exactly. This is the kind of thing a lot of players are going to have to get used to, and frankly, it's a paradigm shift we are still adjusting too as well. We want there to be some talents where you say &quot;Hmmm. I'm not sure I want that.&quot; The &quot;Hmmm&quot; is key. :) If everyone can instantly can dismiss a given talent as garbage, then it's not a decision. It's also not a decision if you are comparing say Selfless Healer to a +10% self damage talent on a primary ability. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262866202/ret-pally-build-12604-feedback/))<br />
<br />
[...] There are going to be non-negotiable talents. We don't really want to make the Prot spec that skips Hammer of the Righteous to be competitive. We don't want every talent to feel like that though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262866202/ret-pally-build-12604-feedback/))<br />
<br />
Glyphs on Beta<br />
You'd be better off just ignoring glyphs completely at this point. Trying to view the talent changes through the lens of old glyphs is just going to lead to strange feedback. This is true of every class. We have turned off some glyphs in beta that really change gameplay to the extent that it will mess up feedback. Perhaps we should just turn them all off until we work on glyphs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262866202/ret-pally-build-12604-feedback/))<br />
<br />
Tanks Stamina curves<br />
Since I am sure it will be asked based on that info, paladins and warriors have the same Stamina curves now. A naked warrior and paladin of the same race will have the same health at 85. Both Protection trees get the same amount of Stamina as a passive. That number will likely be something like 10 or 15% Stamina depending on tuning. (In our current build it is 15%.) In similar gear, their health should be very similar. We'll provide the differences in their cooldowns and how they tank. DKs and druids are likely to have different amounts of health as well.<br />
<br />
Again, this could change. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227683121/thoughts-on-the-current-prot-pally-tree/))<br />
<br />
Shield and Tanking Weapons Itemization<br />
We are making two kinds of shield (healer and tank) and one-handed tanking weapons. We are trying to make all of the tanking weapons about the same speed (no slow vs. fast). With all of the changes, using a one-handed Str weapon might be a reasonable substitute in many cases. We might eventually decide to no longer make tanking weapons (since druids and DKs don't really have them) but we're still doing it for now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227683121/thoughts-on-the-current-prot-pally-tree/))<br />

Crusader Strike<br />
We have been trying Crusader Strike out at both 3 seconds and 4 seconds to see what fits the best. At the moment it is 3 sec (talented) for Ret and 4 sec for Prot and Holy. It all depends on how many other things are going on that you have to juggle. Inquisition, Zealotry and Exorcism and Divine Purpose procs in addition to the basics of CS, TV and Judgement with Holy Wrath filling in any holes can add up to a lot.<br />
<br />
While we definitely want Ret to have an actual rotation in the sense that you aren't just hitting things when they come off of cooldown, we don't want to make it more complex than the other dps specs in the game. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262866202/ret-pally-build-12604-feedback/))<br />
<br />
Haste effect on Seal of Vengeance and Judgement of the Wise<br />
Excellent question. It isn't a talent, but Seal of Truth (Seal of Vengeance) will tick faster with haste and Judgement of the Wise's periodic mana energize will tick faster with haste. A Ret paladin with enough haste might have enough mana to throw out the occasional Consecration, while a fresh 85 might not be able to afford it often. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262866202/ret-pally-build-12604-feedback/))<br />
<br />
Divine Guardian / Divine Protection<br />
Divine Guardian doesn't affect the paladin. Otherwise we feared it would just get used as another tank cooldown instead of for the raid utility for which it was intended.<br />
<br />
We're strongly considering changing Divine Protection into a short cooldown. It is currently a clone of Shield Wall. Considering the paladin 85 also offers strong emergency damage reduction, we thought they could use a short cooldown ability (say 30-60 sec). Shield Block for warriors is being repositioned more as a short cooldown ability. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227683121/thoughts-on-the-current-prot-pally-tree/))<br />
<br />
Avenger's Shield<br />
Avenger's Shield silences as a baseline effect. It no longer dazes, since all that seemed to accomplish was making pulling take longer. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227683121/thoughts-on-the-current-prot-pally-tree/))<br />
<br />
Righteous Fury<br />
Righteous Fury now affects all threat. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227683121/thoughts-on-the-current-prot-pally-tree/))<br />
<br />
Holy Shield and Glyph of Salvation<br />
I'm not optimistic that we'll keep the Salv glyph, but we'll see. As to Holy Shield, it is going through rapid iteration. Our current implementation has it providing 5% block per stack of Holy Power, up to a max of 15%. So you can use Holy Power for threat, healing or mitigation depending on current circumstances. You should be able to keep the 15% block up all the time with a very small amount of effort.<br />
<br />
Warriors get 15% block baseline, so this means the paladin has to work harder for it. Seeing as how the paladin doesn't have to maintain Demo Shout or Thunderclap's debuff, this doesn't seem too great a burden. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227683121/thoughts-on-the-current-prot-pally-tree/))<br />
<br />
Let Holy Wrath apply Vindication<br />
This is, in fact, exactly what we did. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227683121/thoughts-on-the-current-prot-pally-tree/))<br />
<br />
Is Paladin getting too complicated?<br />
As a response to some of the sky falling rhetoric in this thread (not specifically the post I quoted, which was worded quite reasonably) and others like it, allow me to offer the following:<br />
<br />
We have said many times in the past several months that we don't think paladins have enough going on. Now that we're starting to deliver on that, it doesn't surprise me at all to see some concern that things are changing. I'm sure there are some players out there that just really liked the 6969 rotation, but in a game as large as WoW, there are some players who like anything. We need to do what we think is right for the game, and that includes adding some depth to the paladin class. Our goal is to make the class more fun. We don't expect every forum poster is going to 100% agree that we're going about that in the same way they would. We think in the end though that the class will be more fun. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227683121/thoughts-on-the-current-prot-pally-tree/))<br />
<br />
Holy Power: Will this get a new UI element similar to the Warlock shards or Rogue combo points? <br />
Yes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227683121/thoughts-on-the-current-prot-pally-tree/))<br />
<br />
Touched by the Light<br />
Prot paladins get it as a passive. It converts Str to spell power but does not affect healing. Part of what we're trying to do is get paladins to specialize more and be less capable of doing everything with one spec. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227683121/thoughts-on-the-current-prot-pally-tree/))<br />
<br />
Word of Glory and Inquisition<br />
All paladins can use the heal (Word of Glory) and the self-buff (Inquisition). Prot paladins have a talent to allow them to get a defensive use (Holy Shield). Proper use of Holy Power will distinguish a good paladin from a bad, but the system is far more forgiving than combo points. Consider that if you totally ignored Holy Shield you'd be giving up 15% block. Decent, but not life-threatening.

If your account has been compromised you should be emailing/phoning Blizzard's support, not posting about it and hoping someone from Blizzard sees. (Unless you're talking about support from people, in which case I'm sure there are stickies repeating the same things people fail to do to keep their accounts secure.)</div></div><hr />

A lot of adults in Europe don't have a credit card, will. Everyone having one is an American thing. (A lot of British adults do but by no means all and considerably less do in many other European countries)<br />

OK, lets make this easy as pie...<br />
REMOVE the non-negociable talents from the talent trees, and add them as mandatory spells/abilities that you gain as you level up.<br />
<br />
It's like saying 'heres 31 points, you can use as many of them as you like on hese talents, except the 20 that are needed for your spec to be even a little comepetitive'.<br />

Why give us 31 points, if 20 of them are mandatory? boggles the mind...<br />

If you are one of the .1% of people without any sort of credit/debit card, get a prepaid card or give someone $7 and let them purchase it. PROFIT!</div></div><hr />

a) you can get that authenticator for free if you have an iphone or look at ej's forum<br />
b) there are tons of ways to get a free &amp; legal cc in europe<br />

Usually when people get hacked and have another authenticator put on their account, they can still post on the official forums for advice etc if need be. Blizzard just effectively cut off a few people from support, surely?<br />

Blizzard's loss then. I agree with you. When I went to the US (and even Iceland) everyone had a card. Not so common here. The easiest thing to get here is probably a Visa Debit and (in the UK specifically) a lot of people don't bother - cash is still a perfectly good payment method. But despite this I still strongly urge you to try and get one :) Perhaps some friends, family or even neighbours may be willing to order in one for you?<br />
<br />
Authenticator for the forums - To be honest I don't see how this is necessary because it means I'd have to carry my authenticator everywhere I go. I know that's not a hard thing to do but it's quite frustrating when I forget it by accident and want to harmlessly check the forums from work or something.<br />
<br />
Aside from those faults they did say it's periodic (only, we don't know how long these periods are) and authenticating doesn't take long.</div></div><hr />

No..obviously a lot of people are to &quot;uninformed&quot; to keep their accounts safe. Blizzard then offers authenticators. Not good enough eh?

(Unless you're talking about support from people, in which case I'm sure there are stickies repeating the same things people fail to do to keep their accounts secure.)<br />
<br />
<br />
a) even if you get hacked while having an auth attached to your account the stealer cant detach it without having access to your stuff to proove he is you and so cant put another auth on.<br />
b) the forums are not there to qq about being hacked...<br />
<br />
I was hacked before and had an authenticator put on. What would have taken hours by calling tech support (Yes I did, for 5 hours and I never got through) I solved in a much shorter time by giving up on calling, going on the forums, and doing what they have a thread suggesting you do: Make/post in a thread about getting an unauthorized authenticator removed. I got an email stating it was removed and prompting me to change my password about an hour later.<br />
<br />
Sure, people with problems like these are probably in the majority but I was just proving a point that the forums do help with this situation, plus all that is necessary is saying something like &quot;An authenticator was put on my account without my permission.&quot; so any &quot;QQing&quot; that may occur depends on the person.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm all for putting an authenticator in the retail box. Seeing as they're Blizzard, they can probably spare the slight profit loss from the extra authenticator being free with the game. (They can't cost that much to make, based on the cost of them in the Blizzard store)<br />
<br />
On topic: I'm happy with most of the paladin changes, though I'm not so sure with turning Divine Protection into Shield Block rather than Shield Wall. I don't see why they don't turn Holy Shield into Shield Block, since they're playing around with it so much. I'm also really happy they removed the daze from Avenger's Shield, since it seemed to do exactly what they said. The silence part of the shield was good for pulling in casters, but the daze part made it so they only moved about 2 feet before the silence faded and they started casting again. Lastly, the fact that the Judgements of the Wise mana restore ticks faster just relieved my mana concerns for Ret, but still not for Prot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Credit cards market penetration is highly country-dependent, I'm afraid you're guilty of making assumptions. For example, mobile-phone based billing is very popular in several (specifically Nordic, but rapidly spreading East) European countries, rather than credit cards and WAP/i-mode is important in Japan as well. Germany has ELV and gyropay as popular options (and a mere 4 million issued credit cards!).<br />
<br />
dadou131988 - Again, debit cards being accepted issued as VISA/Mastercard is far from universal - In the UK Solo (which is being phased out, but will still be around for a few years yet) and Electron can't, for example. Then there's Laser in Ireland, Carte Bleue Nationale in France (you have to pay extra for VISA/Mastercard, and a lot of people don't), etc. etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, in the Middle East and America, you can assume most gamers have access to a VISA or Mastercard-branded card. But in Europe and Asia, this is simply a bad assumption. The very least Blizzard could do is accepting Paypal and more debit card types!</div></div><hr />

<br />
thus meaning your point is probably inaccurate, fact is you dont know how it works yet, you dont know if all the decitions will be as clean cut as your making it out to be. They mentioned youll have to take one mandetory talent for example tanking, that might only be a 3 point talent, so what makes you think they meant the majority of the talents. With the example they gave would suggest 3 - 5 being mandetory and the 28 - 26 left over being your own decition. <br />

I could be wrong, but thats my point noone knows. so sop jumping to conclutions. this is the beta, things will and have changed.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure why all the rage. The blue post just said &quot;players who utilize authenticators on their account will now be asked to enter it upon their first time logging into the forums&quot;. So, it only applies IF you already use an authenticator. They are not making it mandatory (yet).<br />
<br />
As far as I know you can get a free app for at least the iPhone if not lots of other smartphones by now to act as an authenticator direct from Blizzard.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of real world stores to buy pre-paid credit cards in the UK or you could register for a virtual credit card online with the big credit card companies and pay however you want (its free).</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all I'm 28 years, a parent myself with two kids and I'm from germany.<br />
<br />
Usually we don't use credit cards here - only around 20% of all ppl actually have a credit card. Here, or better said in europe you got a debit card - similar working - you can choose a &quot;credit ammount&quot; you can use (something like 1000€ more then you actually have) BUT the ammont will be booked almost instantly off your account. Not like a credit card and the monthly charge. And if the limits gone .. well .. :)<br />
<br />
Credit cards are not to common here, because you can't pay at the most &quot;everyday&quot; stores with them, they charge you a nice monthly usage fee and the additional charge for transaction kicks in too. Ok, some banks offer you a free card or something like this, but then you have some other restrictions. We just don't need a credit card here. If I want to buy something online I use my direct debit, pay upfront, use paypal or - like I pay the wow fee - I just do it over the phone bill.<br />
<br />
The App won't work too, because I don't have a comp. mobile / cell phone / handy. An option would be a usual store, but actually they can't buy / get an auth from blizzard, I already tried that.<br />
<br />
It would be the best I could use the same payment options in the store like I do when I pay my woe fee. And no, I don't want to get a CC here, because you have to fill out a fuckload of stuff for it and they want to know where you work, how much you get etc. pp.<br />

he's talking about how account hackers put authenticators on accounts that they hack in order to stop the account holder from being able to change the password if they happen to interuppt their pillaging of the account. it's very common these day's, and more than likely the reason why authenticators are sold out quickly after they go back on sale in the blizzard store.</div></div><hr />

Some people just don't get the same access like we do and there are usually some very good security/financial/political reason why they have such differences.<br />
<br />
That being said, I wonder if the reason the Blizzard store doesn't have more options being more of a legal.tax issue rather than a technical one. Even with as open as world trade is, there are tons of laws and rules. Then there is the regulations and taxes, because everyone wants a piece of the pie.<br />
<br />
Not sure why they can't ship them to certain retail stores, but I wonder if it has to do with their manufacturing process for activating them or such. But that's not my field so any insight would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Just curious, how do you pay your monthly subscription fee for WoW? I can't imagine mailing them a check each month &gt;&lt;. <br />
<br />
anyway, your best option is going to be to get a friend with a card to just buy the authenticator for you. It's not that expensive, pay them in cash and get them a beer for their trouble.</div></div><hr />

Also, needing a creditcard for stuff is very annoying, since 100% of the adult population having one does indeed seem to be a very anglo/american thing, and living on credit is not so common in mainland Europe. On that note, enjoy the financial crisis.</div></div><hr />

There's only been one country where I ran into a few minor problems using my Visa, and that's Poland, but they've got ATM's on every corner so no biggie. I've been to London, no problems at all. I've been to Germany, no problems at all, didn't encounter any problems in Spain either. I live in Norway, so being a regular customer in Sweden and Denmark is a standard, and I've never been denied using my Visa. So maybe you should stop including Europe in your crusade against credit cards. Everyone I know owns a Visa.<br />
<br />
I can't use money that I don't have. Visa doesn't work like that. If I don't have money, I can't use my credit card. Mastercard on the other hand, that's the devils work. I don't like being able to spend what I don't have either, so I cut it in pieces the second I got it. (I was given a mastercard with my Visa)<br />
<br />
I don't know if you're not able to get a Visa in your country, and if that is the case, then this post isn't directed towards you.</div></div><hr />

Some of our customers cracked it as they used to be invoiced until that point (although to be fair to us, just before the change our unpaid invoices were reaching about 30%). Anyway, the big line I got the most was &quot;I don't believe in credit cards&quot;. Now, I was good at making other arrangements, get them to place their garage sale ad at the newsagent and have them pay cash, whatever, but I was always thinking, you know, I don't believe in Leonardo DiCaprio but it doesn't make him go away.<br />
<br />
The other thing I heard a lot was &quot;I'm old, I don't have a credit card&quot;. Say what? I really hope I don't disconnect with society that much when I'm older, people seem to form this belief of &quot;these things are for young people so I can't/don't have to bother&quot;. I'm 28 mind you, aware of my mortality but young enough to still be horrified at this thought process...I mean, I knew this guy in his early 70s who went from &quot;learning computers&quot; to putting them together for friends, and I thought that was awesome.<br />
<br />
Oh wait that was a complete tangent! ANYWAY.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I don't think I've ever owed more than $50 on my card, I use it purely for online purchases/places where CC is required, then transfer the money back to cover the difference. I don't think I've ever been charged interest. This thread makes me realise I probably should get a Visa debit! (although having two seperate withdrawal limits came in handy recently).</div></div><hr />

If a low percentage of Europeans have credit cards, it clearly shows that the way of thinking in Europe is that Credit cards are not needed or even that useful. I personally don`t know why anyone would get a credit card.</div></div><hr />

I know it can be harsh to have to use it to post some comment but see above. Those voices about reducing number of users using forums are kinda overreacting this time, its not like RealID, this is to improve security - or better put to make it same level everywhere. I agree with such change.<br />
<br />
Also as someone mentioned - sending auth. with retail box would do Blizz a great job, even if they charge you for that (game + auth.). There are yet some people who cant use it tho, like myself due to many different reasons (minor living at different place i live at - sending code over net kinda beats the idea of auth.)<br />
<br />
Also whats with the credit card disscusion ? I remember not having one five years ago and getting one mostly becouse of paying WoW. Ever heard of different countries being different ? You dont have to bash them for not using same tool you do. That is just being ignorant.</div></div><hr />

Which i gues, im not the only one...Did Blizard even think of that...Why is the blizzard store the only place where you need a creditcard anyway? Why can i spend 100 dollar/euro, to a sex/server/race/name change with Ideal, or Blizards own paying method on one place, but must i have a creditcard, on the other place...<br />

You can't spend what you don't have so can't get in debt with it, but it's accepted wherever a credit card is. There are some fees, but they tend to be small and only when you purchase the card or when you're buying something (mine for ezample charges around 30p for every £10 spent). I've been using one for over a year and I've never had a problem buying anything from Blizzard, or anywhere else for that matter. I know you can get them in the UK, but more than likely they're available in other parts of Europe too.<br />

I actually came here though to quote this as no one seems to have picked up on it:<br />

Anyone who orders the event will also receive this year's BlizzCon-exclusive World of Warcraft in-game item. In addition, for the first time, BlizzCon 2010 Virtual Ticket holders will have access to exclusive BlizzCon merchandise.<br />

And is it my fault that people are retarded enough to give the same name to different things? And no, I'm not even from the US, and even our crappy debit cards can be used online.<br />
<br />
Please look up credit and debit card on wikipedia, two whole different systems. On a debit card the ammount gets charged right after the sale, the credit card does one huge charge per month. Then - the CC I had so far - had a montly fee I don't want to pay (after all I only need a debit card here to buy something at the store or get money), you were charged a HIGH fee for getting money at the cash terminal and even some transactions had a fee.<br />
<br />
WHEN I buy something online, I use my debit card - no need for a CC (usually). And I only buy things in the EU, not overseas, so I don't need a CC there either.<br />
<br />
And btw. I NEVER said I can't pay with it online - works fine in any EU land - it's just not a credit card, it's a different bank system in the EU.<br />

And the friend thing won't work, because of all ppl I know here (nope, not a social standalone ;)) NOBODY got a CC.<br />

<br />
As I said before, you don't need a CC here and I don't want to get one for just one payment. You have to give a fuckload of information to you CC giver and I don't want to pay the monthly fee etc.<br />
<br />
Would you get a CC, give all the information away, pay the transaction and monthly fees etc. pp. if you just wanna buy an auth for 6.99 &#8364;? (Remember, you don't need a CC in the european union)<br />
<br />
<br />
I find it strange that not more people have credit cards nowadays. [..] I live in Norway, so being a regular customer in Sweden and Denmark is a standard, and I've never been denied using my Visa. So maybe you should stop including Europe in your crusade against credit cards. Everyone I know owns a Visa.<br />
<br />
You got me wrong there - I NEVER said CC sucks or something like that. CC are fine and you can use them in the european union, but you DON'T need them here. Everyone in the EU got a debit card and can pay with it online and in other states of the EU. The best is - it's charged directly of your account and usually no monthly / transaction fee. And it's accepted almost everywhere. So WHY should I get a credit card with all of it's downsites (in respect to the debit card I already have - has upsides too, no flame here :))?<br />
<br />
And may I remember you that Norway is NOT a part of the european union and so not in our banking system? Guess you can't buy anything in sweden or denmark with your debit card. That's why your country uses credit cards (world wide system) and should have a way better conditions to get one.<br />
<br />
I NEVER said anything aginst credit cards, I was complaining about their lack of payment options - it's just blizzard and their stupid shop. I can pay my monthly fee by direct debit off my account, wire transfer, paypal, per phone bill etc. - why can't I use those options in their shop?

<br />
1 - they're taking away the daze from Avenger's Shield, which I LOVE for PvE, but I really hope they add a Glyph to add the daze affect back. I like to PvP from time to time as Prot and that daze has been quite helpful there :)<br />
<br />
2 - I don't really understand the design decision with block, comparing Warriors to Paladins. The post said Warriors would get 15% passive, but Paladins need to generate 3 charges of Holy Power and use Holy Shield to get that. Didn't they say Paladins would be blocking more often, and Warriors would be blocking more at a time (allbeit randomly)? Would have thought the 2 classes would be at least on par with each other on block, if not Paladins having more than Warriors.</div></div><hr />

The statement &quot;you need a credit card to order an authenticator&quot; is WRONG. It's not a valid starting point for a discussion.<br />
<br />
You need a card, debit or credit, marked &quot;VISA&quot; or &quot;MasterCard&quot;. Now, in Europe credit cards are not common. DEBIT cards with one of those options are VERY common. I know some countries, mainly UK, got fooled by your banks into getting a domestic variant which nobody else is using but that situation is being rectified. In Sweden however, debit cards with VISA or MC attached are used by a good 90% of the population. Among my friends, the number is 100%. Everyone I know has at least one card which can be used to buy an authenticator (or order other stuff online).<br />
<br />
And, Norwegians with a VISA debit card can use that in 97% of shops in Sweden, so foogy is correct.</div></div><hr />

First of all, you misunderstood me - if there is a VISA or Mastercard logo on it, it goes with the international credit card insitutes by that name. Of course he can buy something with that. I meant with his national debit card system without the visa/mastercard (if there even is one).<br />
<br />
I'm talking (mostly) about germany here - we got a national debit card system called &quot;electonic cash&quot; with an additional Maestro system so we can pay something outside germany. This is the standard here, because it's cheaper and your not charged for transactions and in most cases you don't have a monthly fee to pay. I can pay with it online over the &quot;lastschrift&quot; system (direct debit?) or some other ways. But it's not a credit card or has that function. That should be the same within the EU (at least I know for france and austria).<br />
<br />
My main problem is, that even with a prepaid CC I have to give some info away, are bound to a contract for at least one year, have to pay a yearly/monthly fee for it and they charge the transactions I do. (cheapest I found was 25 € / year).<br />
<br />
So for one auth. for 6.99€ I have to pay the damn fee etc.? Actually I don't need a credit card here anyway, so that's why I'm so pissed about it. Tell me WHY they offer tons of payment options for the montly wow fee but only the cards in their shop? I WANT to use one, but there is just no other way to get one next to the damn store.</div></div><hr />

The trouble is, that many / all hacked accounts nowadays are done by the hacker putting a fake authenticator on the account. This prevents the actual account holder from accessing the account, thus allowing the hacker to clear everything out, un-interrupted. Preventing people from posting on the support forums, then, is a pretty bad idea. <br />
