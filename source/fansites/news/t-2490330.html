If the Blizzard store accepts Blizzard Balance (and I think it does), then yes. If not, no.<br />
<br />
I bought both of them as soon as they were on sale. They will have a place of honor on my desk.</div></div><hr />

Nope, anything on the 'gear store' does not use Bnet balance which is a shame.</div></div><hr />

Imagine someone who then feels the need to comment on such a thing. :p And then the person who has to reply to the person who comments on such a thing, and then the person who replies to that person...<br />

I'm 50/50 on adding them to my collection, but they are nice.<br />

Really annoying how the 15th edition CE is constantly sold out. But they apparently have millions of these things.<br />
<br />
I don't think the CE sold out as quickly as the internet is making it out, i managed to get it from Blizzard hours after it went live.<br />
<br />
That said, they are two different production processes and it's easier to print out action figures and these than the rag one and everything in it.<br />
<br />
TBH, i 100% expect they'll &quot;find&quot; a 2nd wave of the CE sooner or later this summer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They did. I saw the email for it 10 minutes after i got it. Already sold out. What pisses me off, is that I finally have the money to actually buy something like that, and can't cause something that hasnt even shipped yet to people is &quot;sold out&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
these are far easier to make then the CE<br />
also the CE will be sending out another one soon, these are FAAAAR less detailed.<br />

<br />
<br />
Those shoulders on the Alliance shoulder... /facepalm. Sure, you can argue that it's always been that way, but it doesn't make it any less stupid.<br />
<br />
well then why have you been playing wow for 15 years if you dont liek its over the top artstyle?<br />

they can only make so many to get out in time, also they will have more waves.<br />
<br />

good, don't buy them. In the future, hold your tongue unless the thing you have to say actually matters.<br />

I mean for the size its pretty fair price compared to other stuff of the same calibur.</div></div><hr />
