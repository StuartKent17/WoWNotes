A new feat of strength with an associated title, &quot;the Camel-Hoarder&quot;, has been added for players that have bested Dormus (http://www.wowpedia.org/Dormus_the_Camel-Hoarder) and obtained the Reins of the Grey Riding Camel -- because there must always be a Camel-Hoarder.<br />

Unholy<br />
<br />
Desecration (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/55667/desecration/) no longer triggers when an applicable strike hits a snare-immune target. This is primarily to avoid unnecessary spell effect clutter during boss encounters.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / 3.3.5 Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?mage#,,12213) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=.9uf.mage) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1669-Mage-Cataclysm))<br />

<br />
<br />
Frost<br />
<br />
Fingers of Frost (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/83074/fingers-of-frost/) bonus damage applied to Ice Lance has been increased to 25%, up from 15%.<br />

<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / 3.3.5 Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?shaman#,,12213) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=.9uf.shaman) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1124-Shaman-Cataclysm))<br />
Enhancement<br />
<br />
Improved Fire Nova has been redesigned and replaced by a talent called Seasoned Winds (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/16544/seasoned-winds/). When an enemy spell cast is successfully prevented with Wind Shear (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/57994/wind-shear/), the shaman gains magical resistance (in an amount equal to what a protection totem/aura would grant, stacking with such buffs) to the spell school(s) of the interrupted spell (except for Holy spells), lasting 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
Dire Maul North (http://www.wowpedia.org/Dire_maul)<br />
<br />
The Gordok Courtyard Key (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/18266/gordok-courtyard-key/) in Fengus's Chest is now replenished after several seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Mechanar (http://www.wowpedia.org/Mechanar)<br />
<br />
The Cache of the Legion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/30438/cache-of-the-legion-key/) now unlocks when Gatewatcher Gyro-kill is gyro-killed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stratholme (http://www.wowpedia.org/Stratholm)<br />
<br />
Postboxes no longer require keys to open, because really, who locks their postboxes anymore when they're all undead? It's just people sending coupons for brains anyway.<br />
The Postmaster now spawns when 3 of any postbox are opened.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uldaman (http://www.wowpedia.org/Uldaman)<br />
<br />
The Staff of Prehistoria (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/7733/staff-of-prehistoria/) is no longer required to open the door in the Map Room.<br />
Baelog's chest has been given new loot. If it's grey it's good, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
Zul'Farrak (http://www.wowpedia.org/Zul%27Farrak)<br />
<br />
Troll Cages no longer require the Executioner's Key (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/8444/executioners-key/) to open.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guilds<br />
<br />
The amount of guild experience rewarded for rated Battleground guild group wins has been dramatically increased.<br />
Players are now rewarded guild experience for Honorable Kills in the field.<br />
Players are now rewarded guild experience for Battleground wins in Battleground brackets up to level 80.<br />

Items<br />
<br />
All trade goods available for purchase with Honor or Justice Points from the associated commodities vendors have had their prices reduced by 50%.<br />
Maelstrom Crystals (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52722/maelstrom-crystal/) are now available for purchase with Honor or Justice Points from the associated commodities vendors.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Arenas<br />
<br />
The Ring of Valor (http://www.wowpedia.org/Ring_of_Valor) has returned! It should now be playable again in the Arena map rotation.<br />
New starting areas have been added for Ring of Valor. Players will no longer enter the Arena on the elevator. It's been removed. Instead players will start in a room at opposite ends of the Arena.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests &amp; Creatures<br />
<br />
Loot from the creatures Garr (http://www.wowpedia.org/Garr), Julak-Doom (http://www.wowpedia.org/Julak-Doom), Mobus (http://www.wowpedia.org/Mobus), and Poseidus (http://www.wowpedia.org/Poseidus) has been adjusted to be commensurate to their rarity and invested effort.<br />
<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
<br />
The Guild Finder has been implemented! While we are continuing to add final polish to this feature, we welcome all focused testers to give it a go. Feedback can be provided here.</div></div><hr />

Yeah... So.. I targeted it.. took me forever to find it.. I even did a double look at the MODEL of the rare.. and was all like &quot;weird.. a whale shark. Now that's just weird to make an easy elite at 85 look like a whale shark.&quot; aaaaaaaand then I noticed it's HP and about wet my pants because I was milimeters away from pulling it. But I must admit the death wouldve been funny.<br />

So I looked up what loot it dropped and it seemed that.. for having to get a raid group to down him.. it just doesnt seem like worth the time for somethin you'll replace quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Besides sub rogues, Frost mages are dead last in pve raids. In PVE raiding, they use frostbolt a lot. In PVP, they really don´t use frostbolt that much. I am explaining it.. I still think it buffs them slightly in pvp, which I don´t think they need. The other thing is if you read the pvp questions, and this I agree with, frost mages really aren´t overpowered in battlegrounds, it is mostly arena where they can control too much. In battlegrouds, it is much easier to kill them because they can´t control 5 people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You guys know in more arena comps, keeping a frost mages damage down isnt really that difficult, dispels are all thats needed.<br />
<br />
its just being out in the open, with a frost mage anywhere near you is stupid. dont do it.<br />

Frost Mage damage is an issue in both PvE and PvP. I know you want to try and tell yourself that it's not because they Nova/RoF/CoC/etc you and it's annoying, but it is. It's obvious in PvE (Which both changes primarily address), and in PvP against opponents that have a higher IQ than their age, it hard affects anything because Mages are NOT casting Frostbolt, ever. On top of that, all it takes is someone with the ability to dispel, and you just completely shut the Frost Mage down. Dispels are our hard counter, and unlike most classes encompasses an entire role, not just one class. And don't even get me started on their damage, it's a tickle in proper PvP gear. If you're complaining about our damage, you're trolling.<br />
<br />
<br />
More like 35-40k on my 3k5 resil rogue. 15k + 20k while deepfreezed sounds balanced to me... Oh wait... <br />
<br />
You act like nobody else plays this game to know you are lying. You might get numbers like that *if* they are wearing PvE trinkets with equip procs, and currently active or have zerker active. I'm also excluding (for your sake) that numbers like that require at the very least, a Deep Freeze (30s cooldown), and no dispel class in sight. read: setup. While melee classes (as an example) can just run up to us with very short cooldowns and global us for just as much, if not more.<br />
<br />
Just to recap both posts, assuming your team isn't a bunch of tunneling idiots in the 1500 bracket, Frost Mages are hardly an issue anymore.</div></div><hr />

* Desecration no longer triggers when an applicable strike hits a snare-immune target. This is primarily to avoid unnecessary spell effect clutter during boss encounters.<br />
<br />
This adds to the uselessness of Desecration in PvE. If you want to use it as a snare on an encounter it requires tabbing from the boss to trigger and is only usable if there is a snareable target. Desecration is already a weak snare that is mostly used as a back up on some bosses and is not worth it to track and keep up with this change on the few bosses it can be useful.</div></div><hr />

completely what this guy says. All that QQ 'bout frostmages being OP has became rediciously overhiped. Yeah ofc deepfreeze shatter combo's hurt.. but wouild you EVER be so stupid to get that on your ass? That's like letting a rogue do a full shadow dance on you.. That hits a lot more:) <br />
<br />
And yes, they have good control. Bring one dispeller and you're done. Keep pressure on the mage, he just has a limited amount of blinks. When their shields are gone(purge/dispell/ 1/2hits) they are brittle as hell.<br />
<br />
Still think the dmg buff wasn't really necessary, but it's not the end of the world:)<br />

I can still post you some screenshots, yeah, i like to have fun taking screenshot when i see big shinny numbers on my screen while wearing my full PvP gear (3k5 resil). Come on, don't tell us that mages NEVER cast frostbolt, they cast it whenever you are rooted, deepfreezed (wow, 30sec, such a looooong cooldown... not) or out of melee, yeah, mages cast icelance a lot, that's a reality. This kind of setup is not hard to get, at all. Sheep your healer, oops, no more dispell in sight. On use PvE trinket ? No, on use PvP trinkets can do that too. *sigh* just have to die in the deepfreeze while my partner is still sheeped, and silenced at the end of the sheep. Don't say that mages are fine, you are ridiculous to the rest of the wow community and classes.</div></div><hr />

Balance druids will never be buffed :S<br />
<br />
- In a PvE environment, with all the buffs, insect swarm and moonfire normal ticks are hitting 3-4k each. Every other class with dots deal 5-7k<br />
- After the nerf to starsurge (-20%) the spell is hitting a bit more than a starfire and it has 15 sec coolodwn. (core nuke learned with the specialization)<br />
Hunters got the same nerf to Aimed Shot but in exchange they received a buff to Aspect of the Hawk. Where is the compensation for druids ?<br />
- Wrath damages while not in solar eclipse are lower than melee dps' white swings.<br />
- Starfire damages for a 2.5 cast spell are not coherent in Pvp. It's about time to make it a channeled spell.<br />
- What about the instant roots for balance ?<br />
- What about a buff to typhoon ridicolous damages ?<br />
- What about a buff to treants ? they deal the same damages as in WoTLK and they can easylly stoped with a frost nova, they don't attack from ranged like mirror images, and they are a TALENT SPELL...not baseline like Mirror Image....<br />
- What about a buff to healing received while in moonkin form ?<br />
- What about the clunky root breaking mechanic ?<br />
<br />
<br />
We have received only nerfs during this expansion and every buff has been nullified with a nerf the week later...this just sucks.<br />
-50% +50% - 50% damages done by insect swarm and moonfire. At the end of the story those 2 dots are the worst one in the game<br />
moonfury 25% -&gt; 15%<br />
+4% damage on eclipse ? -&gt; -5% damage to everything, moonfury from 15%-&gt; 10%<br />
-20% damage from starsurge<br />
<br />
<br />
what's next ? +15% damage wrath and -0.3 sec starfire just to reed a week later -50% damage from direct damage portion of moonfire ?</div></div><hr />

Step 1: Log into PTR and see the cost for yourself. It is still not a cost effective way to get the crystals.<br />
<br />
Step 2: Enchanters were able to make plenty of money selling mats and enchanting scrolls and it was so fucking easy to get these things it's not even funny. So no you'll still be making plenty of gold.</div></div><hr />

&quot; For starters, we need to make instant spells less powerful. The fact that they are instant should be the big thing those spells have going for them, because immunity from interruption and the ability to shoot and scoot are gigantic advantages. Those spells don’t need anything else to be attractive.&quot;<br />

Hunters got the same nerf to Aimed Shot but in exchange they received a buff to Aspect of the Hawk. Where is the compensation for druids ?<br />
- Wrath damages while not in solar eclipse are lower than melee dps' white swings.<br />
- Starfire damages for a 2.5 cast spell are not coherent in Pvp. It's about time to make it a channeled spell.<br />
- What about the instant roots for balance ?<br />
- What about a buff to typhoon ridicolous damages ?<br />
- What about a buff to treants ? they deal the same damages as in WoTLK and they can easylly stoped with a frost nova, they don't attack from ranged like mirror images, and they are a TALENT SPELL...not baseline like Mirror Image....<br />
- What about a buff to healing received while in moonkin form ?<br />
- What about the clunky root breaking mechanic ?<br />
<br />
I agree, my boomkin is my main and even in PVE I feel completely useless. Pallies and Hunters can bring the same buffs as me and hunters at least can do better damage, DK's are getting our bres, Roots is our only viable CC and it's pretty awful considering most of the mobs that really need to be CC'd anywhere are casters, UH DK's, locks, and mut rogues bring the spell damage buff...I mean, it seems like all I really have left that cant be brought by a class with the same or better DPS is my haste aura. :\ I dont raid hardcore or anything though so I may be missing out on how well they're doing in heroic mode raids etc but to me boomkins just seem really mediocre right now.<br />
<br />
Looks like we at least do really well on 10 man magmaw...lol</div></div><hr />

And the buff to Frostbolt is to help pve mages. Mages cast frostbolt 1 time each 30s (on deepfrezee combo for a litle burst) IF deepfrezze is not dispell by healer, pet or trinket so this will not affect you in pvp. Maybe if the buff on icelance proc also affect frostbolt mages do more hardcasts. Hard to happen because any hardcast you do probably will be interrup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok I assume all of you are PvP players saying this. Let me put it this way, if you are a good pvper you would not let, in arena, a frost mage cast more than 2 (max) frostbolts in a row before CCing them / putting the pressure on them.<br />
<br />
This is to make it more viable in PvE and has almost nothing to do with PvP, stop being bratty PvP-centric players, mages in frost spec are not overpowered if you know how to deal with them at high level arena, most mages at that level don't have the time to spam cast frostbolt because the people they are playing aganist can actually control them long enough to make spam frostbolt unable. The problem lies with you people crying, not blizzard and not the mages..</div></div><hr />

Unless forst mage dont use frost bolt in pvp which I doubt, this is a straight PvP buff as well. <br />
I dont think anyone will have nothing better to do than interrupting frost bolts, unless the healer is dead. <br />

<br />
Forst mage cast no more than 2 frostbolt in a row, is usually because they have to poly-morph or freeze someone.<br />
Again they maybe get CCed from time to time because of their awesome CC, but I dont think mage is a kill priority right now. Mage is not those &quot;sitting duck&quot; class that dks and warriors can just melee zerg it.<br />
<br />
I dont even understand the priority of making a dps spec of a dps class with 3 dps trees viable, while some hybrid dps class is struggling behind fire mages .</div></div><hr />

I play a Giraffe Jedi Counsellar. Hit me!<br />
<br />
The Frosbolt damage I can understand and the Icy Barrier scaling I can also understand, the thing though in the Q and A where they were talking about other spells not being dispellable I shall presume against my better judgement they mean the self buffs and possibly expanding from the Chains of Ice glyph or talent that roots the target for a couple of seconds and isn't dispellable magic anymore. The thing that makes me think here is how much they should apply change here in this regard; things like Pain Suppression and Barkskin are no longer dispellable already, so will other self buffs get the same deal, or will it be limited. Will existing non dispellable effects be made so that they can be taken away by purge and dispel?<br />
<br />
Normally in world situations you'll get a lot of different annoying class and spec combinations which make life difficult - currently I am working on Tol Barad rep with my Priest - but this is part of the variety in the game.

Blizzard is just becoming unreasonable!!! It is hypocritical to make blog posts about pvp balance and then give more advantage to yet overpowered classes !!!<br />

And to one above who CC's/ pressures the mage in arena: Dude, he won't be alone there, ffs. You stun him, he blinks, you stun him again or whatever, he trinkets, you press him he cc's you, you manage to stun him or whatever, guess what, he just fucking blinks again.

In PVE raiding, they use frostbolt a lot. In PVP, they really don´t use frostbolt that much. I am explaining it.. I still think it buffs them slightly in pvp, which I don´t think they need. The other thing is if you read the pvp questions, and this I agree with, frost mages really aren´t overpowered in battlegrounds, it is mostly arena where they can control too much. In battlegrouds, it is much easier to kill them because they can´t control 5 people.<br />
<br />
They cannot balance Arcane or Fire for PvE, why in the living hell are they trying to balance Frost for PvE? They are trying to do way too much with way too little. The current mentality of the developers is abysmal. They made my decision to stop playing WoW and moving to Rift look more and more genius like every move they make.</div></div><hr />

This is a joke...right? More deeps buffs to mages again? Holy cow someone has a mage as main on the dev team.<br />

the answer isnt someone, its everyone on the devteam obviously<br />

Also, to those complaining about the Maelstrom Crystal change: You knew (or ought to have known) this was coming. Right now the crystal is too pricey -- or hard to obtain, since you have to hope no one wants a purple item drop -- for the average player.

No reason for frost mage buffs while other classes that could kill them (ahem druids) are getting the nerfbat over and over.<br />

Ghostcrawler and whoever is doing this, you're doing a horrible job. I can't believe the development and design teams come to agreement on this garbage. My only wish right now, and this is a stretch, is that someone higher up in the company will see this nonsense and hire some people to run pvp who actually pvp instead of looking at pve numbers on spreadsheets.<br />

Dmg on frostbolt and icelance was surely needed,up until now it hit like 25-30k shatter combo.Most classes global more then that.<br />
<br />
You must be terribly geared if that's all your shatter combo hits for. Try 35-40k with both critting at entry level pvp gear.</div></div><hr />

You do realize this one was a MASSIVE rng fest right? It had nothing to do with skill and with the nerf to premades down to 5 person limit it was......impossible to plan for. Same with some other achis. Hello AV perfection, the perfect storm etc. They need to bring back full premades vs pugs or you will NEVER get those. That is part of the reason i stoped playing, 50 EOTS matches and neither side got CLOSE to getting The perfect storm. I realized that achi was all about dumb luck which essansialy became the last nail in my wow coffin. 4 years of this and i am glad i left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I normally play a balance druid for rated bg's but decided to bring up my mage to 85. It is faceroll easy in scrub gear.<br />
<br />
In battlegrounds and starter gear, I am seriously messing people up. The control is over the top, and shatter combos do so much damage that the opponent typically can't recover from it. Then just kite around. And yes, you do cast Frostbolt if the target is frozen immediately followed by ice lance or throw out Frostfire if the instant cast proc is up.<br />
<br />
@people saying just dispel: In arena yes, you're more likely to have a dispeller at your beck and call. In battlegrounds, that may not always be the case.</div></div><hr />

Holy Paladin buff - probably an attempt to finally fix them PvP wise, aka bring them on the same level as other healers. I dont think that this will do it.<br />
<br />
Maelstorm Crystals - you stupid whiners dont realise that they are about to release 2 new 5mans you can chain queue all day every day with epic loot? If anything these dungeons will totally destroy price of the Crystals, not 1 crystal per 2000JP or how much they will cost.

These days the thing all cool kids do is griefing by *leaving* immediately after they happen to loot the key.

Probably because mages have never had it bad throughout the entire history of wow, theyve pretty much always been op in some respect or other. <br />

These things have to be changed because of griefing. People dropping group, afking or porting out with the key and going &quot;lulz i haz the key! Pay me and ill come back!&quot; <br />

In PVE raiding, they use frostbolt a lot. In PVP, they really don´t use frostbolt that much. I am explaining it.. I still think it buffs them slightly in pvp, which I don´t think they need. The other thing is if you read the pvp questions, and this I agree with, frost mages really aren´t overpowered in battlegrounds, it is mostly arena where they can control too much. In battlegrouds, it is much easier to kill them because they can´t control 5 people.<br />
<br />
Which class can control and should control 5 player in a battelground - what is this for a &quot;excuse&quot; for the PvP buff ?<br />

It means that all the stuff you could by for justice points, like savage leather and elementium ores only costs half of what they used to cost. This does not apply to the justice point gear.</div></div><hr />

You play in a dead server you'll get a f-ed economy. The servers that aren't dieing have people doing raids weekly and DEing most crap now that they've geared up. I played in Silvermoon until two weeks ago and Maelstroms were going for 1k I imagine they're sub-1k now.<br />
<br />
These changes are welcome but laughable. With the new heroics giving epic items left and right the shards would become easily obtainable...<br />
<br />
Also, they're reducing the trade goods prices by 50% on the honor/justice vendors? Just two months too late, when they were on PTR everyone said they were too expensive... good to know Blizzard hears their customers. :P<br />

Yes, only 20k. And for that we NEED you to be in nova and have FoF. Do you think that we have them up all the time? Other classes are &quot;OP&quot; too, but the lamest thing atm is that you can't solo a healer. It's fucking annoying and &quot;unfair.&quot; He can't kill you either but still.</div></div><hr />

If you lose to a mage with 4.1k resi as a DK you suck. No offense. AMS, Grip, Icebound forti, trinket to DF, DR on roots, we need FoF to get ice lance to do damage... You can strangulate us for 5sec, you got mind freeze to interrupt frostbolt, you can heal yourself with your pet if you have talented it (should have?) you can DoT us and run, mage can't run while doing damage etc etc etc.<br />

Rift is nothing like Warhammer or Aion. The only downside to Rift IMO is how clunky the combat seems, it's not as smooth as the combat in WoW. Speaking of game clones...WoW copied almost everything from EQ when it was first launched.</div></div><hr />

IT was the same, back in the days when rogues were the love child of blizzard and insanity, and were able to keep you stunned for like 1 min, much much more than they need to kill you.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is just becoming unreasonable!!! It is hypocritical to make blog posts about pvp balance and then give more advantage to yet overpowered classes !!!<br />
<br />
And to one above who CC's/ pressures the mage in arena: Dude, he won't be alone there, ffs. You stun him, he blinks, you stun him again or whatever, he trinkets, you press him he cc's you, you manage to stun him or whatever, guess what, he just fucking blinks again. If you are not already dead somewhere in between , you will be very soon. If you are a melee class you die like 98/100 encounters vs frost mage<br />

Maelstroms have been far too high in price considering what the enchants that require them offer over the next best enchant.

<br />
Ah finally. On the 4th day after release Julak-Doom was in my way of finishing up TH quests so I called on my guild to gank him. A while later we killed him and a blue dagger dropped. Pretty sure it went to a lvl 83 because our lvl 85's already had better weapons from quests and heroics.<br />
Considering we needed about 20 people back then to take him down and only 4 days after release people already had better stuff I'd say that dagger was rather underwhelming.<br />
<br />
Still fun though, first raid kill in the expansion for us.</div></div><hr />

Nope just the trade goods, Leather/enchanting mats/cloth and the like. The gear should stay at the same price.</div></div><hr />

The main complaints against frost mages are from PvE geared toons who get rocked by them in random BGs. Glad to see that blizzard understands this and isn't falling for the knee jerking QQ. <br />

Your reading comprehension is wrong. He said 1/120th of your health MORE, meaning the difference between 10000 and 11000, which is 1000, which is 1/120th of your health.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melodi</div><div class="date">2011-03-23, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PvP wise, frost mages probably didn't need a buff. However, on the PVE side of things they were getting curb stomped by Fire, and since they are bringing up arcane mages to be more in line, then it was necessary to balance frost mage damage as well. At least that's how I took it.<br />
<br />
Now on to more important matters: YAY! Maelstrom crystals will be able to be bought with justice points. :)</div></div><hr />

Explaining why he is wrong would make you more credible, but it doesn't matter, because he is right.</div></div><hr />
