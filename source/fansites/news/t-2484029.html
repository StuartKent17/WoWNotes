With weekly resets in each region, we’re making the following adjustments to three raid encounters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle of Dazar’alor<br />
<br />
Lady Jaina Proudmoore<br />
<br />
The random Bombard locations in stage one are now less likely to light a Zandalari Ballista on fire when players are not nearby.<br />
Chilling Touch now begins when Arcane Barrage is interrupted (previously was when Nathanos is freed).<br />
Prismatic Images now spawn closer to Jaina (was centered on the middle of the area).<br />
Icefall is timed to no longer coincide with full power Gathering Blizzard in Mythic difficulty.<br />
Gathering Blizzard and Freezing Blood should now be more responsive in Mythic difficulty.<br />
Jaina’s health has been reduced by 5% in Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Crucible of Storms<br />
<br />
The Restless Cabal<br />
<br />
Void Crash and Crushing Doubt now prefer ranged targets.<br />
Witness the End duration reduced to 7 seconds (was 9 seconds) in Mythic difficulty.<br />
Zaxasj the Speaker and Fa’thuul the Feared health reduced by 5% in Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
Uu’nat, Harbinger of the Void<br />
<br />
Void Crash now prefers ranged targets.<br />
Insatiable Torment now prefers damage dealers.<br />
Piercing Gaze of N’Zoth duration reduced to 4 seconds (was 5 seconds) in Mythic difficulty.<br />
Undying Guardians health reduced by 17% in Mythic difficulty.<br />
The number of players targeted with Unstable Resonance has been reduced to 12 per cast (was 18) and now prefers ranged targets on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Uu’nat’s health reduced by 5% in Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In Crucible of Storms, along with slightly reducing the overall difficulty of its encounters on Mythic difficulty, these changes are aimed at encouraging more diverse raid compositions, as well as making the encounters more accessible to guilds with melee-heavy rosters.<br />
<br />
Again, these changes should go live with resets in each region.<br />
<br />
<br />
Recruit-A-Friend Is Going on Hiatus<br />
Recruit-A-Friend (RAF) is heading into the workshop! The longstanding RAF program is going on hiatus while we construct something new that makes it even more rewarding to introduce your friends to World of Warcraft. As of June 11, 2019, the current program will come to an end, and you’ll no longer be able to send new RAF invitations. Don’t worry though—the program will be back in its new form before you know it.<br />
<br />
To take advantage of the current RAF program, your friend will need to link a qualifying WoW account to yours before June 11, and will have 90 days to purchase game time to trigger any rewards.* Check out the RAF web page (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/recruit-a-friend) for the details on the current program and the available rewards.<br />
<br />
We look forward to sharing the details of the new RAF program with you in the future!<br />
<br />
*Recruited friends must not already have a World of Warcraft account, or their account must be fewer than 30 days old. Link period lasts for 90 days after your friend's account was first created.</div></div><hr />

This isn’t the first time they have paused it to update the system. It’s unlikely it has any thing to do with the xp boost.<br />

This is the quickest after changing it they've ever had to change it, 50% with no stacking was a mistake and it bit them in the Ass 100% guarantee.<br />

It’s only been shut down once before, It was added in 2008 and changed in 2013 so 5 years. It’s then been 6 years since then so it’s still a longer gap.</div></div><hr />

Watch some top guilds during any kind of realm first race. Check how many melees they usually bring. That's how &quot;melee friendly&quot; most encounters are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a melee player who has to watch Ranged fuck up mechanics and I can't do a thing about it but watch the wipe, I'd love to have the mechanics. The fact that melee get to do nothing but sit and hit a boss isn't actually fun for us either. It's crap design to have fights that only engage a quarter of your raid group. So, no it's not melee being braindead, Blizzard just can't seem to design raid mechanics that are melee friendly and aren't any more engaging than &quot;stack on this side of boss, now swap to other side.&quot; or &quot;spread loosely 5yds around boss' ass to avoid spreading the bad.&quot; or &quot;k swap to a different target, DK plz grip it into cleave range.&quot;</div></div><hr />

But for average guilds it just becomes mythrax 2.0 where you just stack as much melee as possible because they didn't get any mechanics after the nerfs.</div></div><hr />

Probably.<br />
<br />
Any decent source of XP got nerfed these days just so they can claim their revamped levelling experience is a &quot;success&quot;.<br />
<br />
RAF did actually get nerfed to 50% down from 200 and Heirlooms couldn't stack with it.</div></div><hr />

Of course not. But it'll give them an opportunity to gain more players next expansion.<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt this expansion is having a high influx of new players so why not take it down now instead of later?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They already nerfed it to pointlessness. They sold a lot of base game copies plus 2 months game time with it and now they don't, mostly to people wanting to level alts and who were never going to buy boosts.<br />
<br />
If they nerf it anymore they may as well leave it removed forever.</div></div><hr />

They really need more bosses like the end boss of Mogu'Shan Vaults.<br />

They start to do attacks in different directions or in a short radius around themselves. Dodge them all and you get a one-use ability to do lots of damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You’re on the right track, I think. The issue with raid mechanics is that they are a huge DPS loss for melee as it can reduce boss uptime drastically, so something that would be fun to do would just make your DPS dip so low that the disparity between Ranged and Melee in “meta” comps would be even larger.<br />
<br />
What would be cool is if Melee got some legit fun mechanics to do, break the monotony a bit from tunneling a boss, and in return for doing the mechanic gain a DPS boost in some form or another. That way they stay competitive on meters while actually being engaged in the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no that doesn't make any sense as last time they reworked it they also shut it down and boost didn't exist then.</div></div><hr />

Only if you're one of those salty world 1st contenders--not saying you are--which is nothing a pipedream anyway.<br />

<br />
What's funny is you bring up &quot;melee-heavy rosters&quot; but no one bitches when everything is easier for ranged heavy rosters, like it almost ALWAYS has been. You should be able to kill a boss with any balanced roster.<br />

Only difference between this expansion and the last ones is the level of gear you can get WITHOUT raiding which is the only sad part, raids always get nerfed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because just changing it will not get any attention. Taking it away and then reintroducing it is much better. That's why you see &quot;re-openings&quot; of everything instead of &quot;well, we just painted the walls. Not much to see.&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I brought up &quot;melee heavy rosters&quot; as an example of the anathema that is killing this game. Have you considered reading slower so you can take the full point in?<br />
<br />
<br />
but no one bitches when everything is easier for ranged heavy rosters, like it almost ALWAYS has been. You should be able to kill a boss with any balanced roster.<br />
Balance is subjective, but I agree with the first part. Many other MMORPGs far outweigh WoW in this regard. Hell, even real life does Ranged DPS better; unsub and try an archery social club for great &quot;fun&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Not really, balance is pretty much objective. <br />
<br />
Balance in terms of a group makeup in this regard is not leaning heavily towards melee or ranged but an equal, or close to equal number of both. WoW raids have always leaned more towards a Ranged Heavy raid make up.<br />
<br />
And it's not raid balance that's killing the game, honestly, at all. Raids have been nerfed so more people can do them for most of the games life.<br />
<br />
In fact there has been bosses that were never killed till after nerfs started, like LK and the first 5% nerf. If you want to get technical almost ever recent end boss has had to have some sort of balancing nerf prior to being killed.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. People will happily pay a sub if the quality of the game is equivalent to the sub cost.<br />

So what can we make no comparisons at all to leveling raf or any thing else before wod because of boost? <br />
<br />
Before mop we still had granted levels and the 200% xp boost, leveling also took a lot longer in mop then it does now. They would have had every reason to not shut it down in mop if money was the only reason for the shut down.</div></div><hr />

Your definition of balance is when melee = ranged in any raid environment. I'm not even going to get into how horribad that would be, but I will point out that, to some people, balance simply means &quot;I can down bosses with relative ease even if my raid is made up of 20 partially dead BR hunters.&quot; Hence, balance is subjective.<br />
<br />
<br />

Accessibility is what keeps killing this game. Try to keep up. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not horribad... what's horribad is raid groups only wanting 1-2 melee because any more means they will have harder time.<br />
<br />
It's like that almost every boss for the last 10+ years.<br />
<br />
And you're the one who said allowing raids that are heavy melee to have a chance to kill the boss is part of what's ruining the game, no, no it's not. What's ruining the game is WF/TF, removal of master loot, the shitty state of classes, etc. Raiding is mostly the one steady thing.<br />
<br />
And no balance is not at all subjective, just because someone BELIEVES that balance is &quot;I can down bosses with relative ease even if my raid is made up of 20 partially dead BR hunters.&quot; doesn't mean that's ACTUAL balance. Balance in wow can never actually exist without making every class the same, but they could do 100x better job of attempting to balance things like top spec not pulling 20%+ more then the bottom spec and melee and ranged balance in raid environments.</div></div><hr />

&quot;In game design, balance is the concept and the practice of tuning a game's rules, usually with the goal of preventing any of its component systems from being ineffective or otherwise undesirable when compared to their peers. An unbalanced system represents wasted development resources at the very least, and at worst can undermine the game's entire ruleset by making important roles or tasks impossible to perform.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's pretty cut and dry actuall, black and white. Having a system where it is more desirable to be melee or ranged heavy is UNBALANCED, having a spec that is not taken because another outperforms it is also a state of UNBALANCE.<br />
<br />
Right now there is a good 13 or so specs that are in an extreme state of unbalance in M+.</div></div><hr />

If Y spec is not desired for raids, then it's likely good at something else. That's balance, or so I say.</div></div><hr />

It'll never be either, that would be a death sentence for the game, both models are usually horrendous when it comes to actual functionality.<br />

Either they go p2w and piss people off, or go cosmetic only and don't make enough money. <br />

Since you DON'T know the true reasons for their shutdowns, only what they told us as the reasons, your argument falls flat. <br />
<br />
However, this time having boosts, removing an obsolete feature, like this nerfed RAF, won't be such a huge financial loss, because THERE ARE boosts. There's also an alternative for players, albeit more expensive.<br />
<br />
Comparing the above with a fully buffed RAF is nonsensical.</div></div><hr />

The won't drop it until it is finished but they will have a sub like EA Access to gain access to ALL their games fully both Activision and Blizzard games including WoW covered under one fee. I would be surprised if they don't announce that at Blizzcon this year. Or they could drop the fee and put a season pass for free shit in-game.</div></div><hr />

If Blizzard do any of those 2 crappy things then I'm done with them for good.<br />

Only one of their games right now requires a sub to play. I don't want to have to pay a sub to play the other soon to be 9 (Warcraft 3 remaster).</div></div><hr />

You don’t know the reason any more then I do. the difference is I can draw parallels to what they have done in the past while you have nothing. <br />
<br />
Boost don’t change every thing like you seem to think they do as wow had granted levels massive xp boost and even a level 80 boost in cata for returning players.</div></div><hr />
