We’ll have our next stress test for WoW Classic on 2019-06-19T21:00:00Z. This stress test will be accessible to anyone with an active World of Warcraft game account in the Americas &amp; Oceania region. For players who have not yet tested World of Warcraft Classic, the game will become available for download late tomorrow, June 18.<br />
<br />
For this stress test, all races and classes will be available for creation, and the maximum character level will be capped at 15. In addition to the open world, there will be instanced content available at that level. This will include Warsong Gulch for PvP as well as Ragefire Chasm, Wailing Caverns, and Deadmines. Of course, Deadmines will be a challenge for players to complete at this level.<br />
<br />
Please focus as much play as possible during the first three hours of the stress test. During this time, we’ll be looking for more issues to address under initial launch conditions. The stress test realm will remain available for 48 hours.<br />
<br />
If you encounter any issues during the test, please let us know by using the in-game bug reporting tool. If there is anything you’d like to discuss further, feel free to post here in the Classic Discussion forum.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much!</div></div><hr />

As a EU citizen I feel really offended by this /s.<br />
<br />
Honestly I'm glad I'm not invited. Wasted so much time on the first two stress test's and I'm just not able to not participate but honestly I should just save myself for the release. It's just around the corner and spoiling myself in the stress test is just such a waste at this point. Still I would do it if I got invited, like with the previous two...</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately its the latter. Devs are in US, it would make sense for them to test in US time zone and with smallest possible latency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know it sucks to feel left out, and it still seems limiting, but they are letting in a ton more people than have been in yet. I wouldn't be surprised if other zones get tested soon. They'll want to test the latency at some point</div></div><hr />

<br />
It simulates launch conditions quite effectively(just 10x-50x less people logging in at the same time). There aren't many people who will try to connect to NA from EU during launch.</div></div><hr />

To be honest it wasnt too bad.<br />
the utter pain is the mob spawns each quest taking 4-5 hours even when groups are formed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Means ur in the stress test now. You can play on the above dates.<br />
If you can play it right now, you're also in the beta.<br />
<br />
It's the same client, but getting Stress test doesn't mean you get beta also.<br />
<br />
<br />
Servers are going to crash and burn.... they couldn't handle the limited amount of people in the LAST stress test that was even lower than the first because people gave up on it.<br />
<br />
God forbid that was the purpose of a stress test, to stress test servers...<br />
<br />
Clearly they think their current solution will fix it, why else you think there's a ST again?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They stress tested something alright, but it wasn't what they intended to test. And pretty sure this test was scheduled already, so that is the entire reason there is another stress test.<br />
<br />
Honestly IDC about how bad they are, it's just funny, but I really hope they don't take these tests as a sign and open too many servers....</div></div><hr />

I envy those who never played Vanilla, but probably for a different reason then you lol... it wasn't a very good version of the game IMO, TBC and Wrath were miles better but I'll still do classic to show support so we can get TBC and Wrath servers.</div></div><hr />

amazing how rose tinted people can be about wotlk,it was by far the worst expac,yes even worse than wod,as everything in wrath besides a few ulduar hardmodes and lk pre nerf was a complete joke,cathup gear was insane strong,there was nothing to do outside raids and pvp,dungeons were easier than they have ever been,i swear people remember it fondly because arthas or because they started in wrath,there is no logical reason to ever prefer wrath over any other xpac</div></div><hr />

No, it's not rose tinted glasses... i litterally just played through it all again on the &quot;naughty servers&quot;. I don't care if you think something is &quot;easy&quot; it doesn't have to be hard to be fun to me.<br />

Class design was reaching a peak at that point, it peaked in mop and everything has been shit since then.</div></div><hr />

Wrath wasn’t even close to being as bad as WoD - Wrath is still one of the best expansions. TBC was one of the worse ones, even now it’s still horrendous to go to (which thanks to level scaling I don’t). Compared to expansions now, sure, maybe it doesn’t look as good, but that can be said about any product that’s over 10 years old.</div></div><hr />

It's almost as if they needed to test what happens when they stress their servers. Odd.</div></div><hr />

If you're going to play Classic come August, I'd just wait. I have access to Classic beta and I've been playing really slow, not even 30 yet lol (24) because I don't want to burn out and do too much. I have really enjoyed what I have played so far tho but I'm glad they aren't bumping the level cap for beta up (fingers crossed) because I'd prefer to wait for release.</div></div><hr />

In comparison to every expansion we’ve got it wasn’t the best. The questing was the same Classic, the story they screwed up (which they admitted and learned from) and the raiding was middle. It’s not *the* worst, but it’s down there.</div></div><hr />
