Every now and then, people mail me to ask if there is any information on the Dance Studio promised in the early days of Wrath of the Lich King and the answer is simple: no. Of course it doesn't mean that I can't dig through the files to see if there is anything interesting here.

Every now and then, people mail me to ask if there is any information on the Dance Studio promised in the early days of Wrath of the Lich King and the answer is simple: no. Of course it doesn't mean that I can't dig through the files to see if there is anything interesting here. <br />

Dance Moves<br />
A few dance moves were added to the game files a few months ago and have been here since then. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/august/dancemoves_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/august/dancemoves.jpg)<br />
<br />
According to this file, players should be able to customize their dance with a few options :<br />
<br />
Race / Gender specific moves - in this case we can see 10 variations for the Blood Elf Female's dance.<br />
Special Effects - The &quot;ALL - FX - Frost Nova&quot; effect is called &quot;Icy Finale&quot;, we can assume that players will be able to include shiny visual effects to their dances. <br />
Modifiers - A few options like &quot;Hold for four seconds&quot; or &quot;Repeat for ten seconds&quot; are here<br />
Emotes - Apparently you will have the option to include some of the in-game emotes to your dance. <br />
<br />
By digging a little more in the game files, we can also find a few command / error messages related to the dance studio. <br />
<br />
ERR_DANCE_CREATE_DUPLICATE<br />
ERR_DANCE_SAVE_FAILED<br />
ERR_DANCE_DELETE_FAILED<br />
PlayDance<br />
WARNING! Cannot start a new dance while one is in progress<br />
Unknown dance move (ID: %u)!<br />
Dance Loaded:<br />
Dance no longer exists<br />
You haven't created a dance with that name<br />
Usage: PlayDance(&quot;dance name&quot;)<br />
dancecache.wdb<br />
ERROR! danceMovesDB does not have record id %d<br />
DBFilesClient\DanceMoves.dbc<br />
<br />
Again, keep in mind that this isn't official for the moment but if I had to draw conclusions based on what we have in the game files, I'd say that the Dance Studio will let players create custom dances by combining different moves, effects, and modifiers. Once they are happy with their dance, it looks like they will be able to name it and share it with other players (it would explain the dancecache.wdb to store them clientside). The PlayDance(&quot;dance name&quot;) command most likely means that players will be able to save multiple dances on a character and pick one depending on their mood. <br />
<br />
That's it, I know it's not much but I thought it might be interesting to share what I already know about this even if some of this info could already be outdated. Blizzard doesn't update these files regularly and we will only know how it works when we see if on the official site or the test server. <br />

Yes, but dedicating a team to work on the dance studio obviously takes away resources from other stuff.<br />

Duh. But they are still manhours spent on flavor crap that could be spent on worthwhile things. I dont care if they have 300 people in their Modeling and Animation department, if 5 of them are working on dances and another 5 working on pets, that's 400 manhours a week spent on stupid crap. <br />

Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean others don't.<br />
It's a fairly slow storyline, but still interesting to read.<br />
<br />
There &quot;are&quot; however dozens of other wow comics out there, which all deserve some front page time so and then, imo.<br />
<br />
Cru the dwarf (http://www.drunkduck.com/Cru_The_DwarF/) is awesome.<br />
And Beyond the tree (http://beyondthetree.wordpress.com/) should certainly be put in a visible location some time as well. It's very well made.<br />

I think it's one of those things that.. if you haven't been reading it for a while (a long while) you don't get it. Atleast the art is good. <br />

<br />
I find the complaints about the delay interesting. Yeah they said it was coming, but it obviously wasn't up to Blizzard's standard. If it had come out &quot;on time&quot; and it was crap, everyone would've run it into the ground even harder. Patience is good, if this turns out to be true, I can't wait.</div></div><hr />

Lets get rid of mounts also and just have +100% run speed buff! Lets remove amazing wordly scenery and cool spell effects.

What I meant was, there was a lot of custom animations and stuff used in the April Fool's Joke trailer, and that spreadsheet could be leftover from that.<br />
<br />
My theory is not likely, just go with Boub, he's right, I'm not. lol</div></div><hr />

Then someone expanded that idea: &quot;Well, now that we are doing the animations anyways, why not make them available to all races?&quot; - and they finally agreed on an entire dance studio, just to take the idea to the extremes. <br />
Don't get the wrong though, I'm very excited about it and I have some pretty high hopes for it. I just hope they'll have it ready for 3.3, so we don't have to wait until Cata:)</div></div><hr />

You say it like raiding content isn't actually enjoyable. Admittedly, it doesn't get challenging until you get to Hard Modes or Heroic (ToC-10 heroic is an awesome challenge, i must say), but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable. Yes, Naxx was reused. Yes, onyxia will be reused (although that's a special case).<br />
<br />
You could do a better job with designing New and Interesting boss mechanics when they've already exhausted so much i take it? You're qualified in the same fields as the designers then?<br />
<br />
No? Well then, STFU.<br />
<br />
It's the same with &quot;Content is too easy&quot; theory. You know why that started? Because Ensidia cleared all the 25-man content within 3 days. 75% of that content, they'd done back at 60, so knew the tactics, and were the top guild at that point.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont recall making any points that you argued against. Raiding content is very enjoyable. That's why I want more of it. I understand some ppl will have fun scripting dances, but I personally wont. No I'm not a designer, when did i say I was? I pay them to design for me. Do you claim to be as good as anyone you pay to do something for you? You know the telecom system better than the people you pay your cellphone bill to? If you are going to try to argue with me then argue the point I made instead of ranting about something else.</div></div><hr />

I dont care if they have 300 people in their Modeling and Animation department, if 5 of them are working on dances and another 5 working on pets, that's 400 manhours a week spent on stupid crap. <br />

<br />
<br />
This is just your opinion. What you call stupid, many others find meaningful. And, obviously, so do many of the people responsible for the creation of this game and the direction in which to take it. Despite what your mother may have told you, the world does not revolve around you and what you want, not even the World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IT'S A GAME!<br />
<br />
So, there are some things to be considerated about it, like:<br />
-Things doesnt't need to make sense all the time. <br />
-Things don't need to be useful, as this is a game, if you want something with a purpose, get a job or go do some charity work, the objective of this damn thing is to be fun, don't take it serious.<br />
-You're not the only one playing the damn game, if you don't like a thing or two, who cares? I don't enjoy a lot of things as well, doesn't mean anything.<br />
<br />
Ye ye, bugs, whatever, they could do this and that, ok. But if you can't understand the revamping of onyx and if you don't even celebrate your own bday, that's not blizz problem, they do it, and what you call old, they, as many others call classic. Even if you wasn't around by that time.<br />
But above all things, if this is really something and is being developed at this damn slow speed, what makes you think that they got an entire team working on it every day of a week? Even if it was faster than this, that's not how things are usually developed, tell me you only work on one project at time, ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No new models for bosses.<br />
A two room instance.<br />
Armor models shared between multiple classes.<br />
<br />
Then after that you have to do the same instance again on a harder difficulty and gather each tier item three seperate times. Whatever your opinion on whether or not the dance studio is a good use of developer time you have to admit that there is pretty much not much new to see in that instance for raiders.<br />
<br />
Maybe the next raid instance will offer something new ... oh wait ... it's Onyxia's Lair.<br />
<br />
You might be able to forgive them if there was a lot of new raid content already in WotLK but the first raid was Naxxramus revamped. Ulduar is basically the only new raid instance in WotLK so far. Two one room, one boss instances and a two room instance with no new boss models other than that.<br />
<br />
TBC had Karazhan, TK, SSC, ZA, BT and MH all new instances, new boss models, new graphics everywhere at this stage (if you equate Sunwell to Icecrown as the final instance) as well as having the one boss instances in Magtheridon and Gruul. That is six entirely new, large, multiboss instances for TBC (not counting sunwell) contrasted to one new, one recycled and one tiny instance in WotLK.<br />
<br />
It is no wonder the raiders are bored. The promise from Blizzard was that by going to the 10/25 dual size instance structure they would be able to add more raid content faster for all players. The reality is that for whatever reason they have not been able to deliver on that promise. Coming close to the end of the expansion there is, even counting TotC, two new multiboss raid instances in the game, compared to the six new raid instances that had been added at this point in TBC.<br />
<br />
While I love the game and still enjoy playing it, you have to wonder exactly what the raiders are supposed to be doing all the time. Ulduar is still the only significant endgame instance. TotC can be cleared in 40 minutes or less (while heroic is harder I am sure it gets cleared almost as quickly by some guilds). <br />
<br />
In short, the 10 / 25 man, easy / hard and now normal / heroic model that was supposed to allow blizzard to deliver so much more raid content has not worked from that regard. It has allowed more guilds to experience the content but it has, if anything, slowed the pace at which Blizzard are delivering instances.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not everything is about blowing your mind away and making something so new in fresh that your eyes literally explode. Sometimes its about the story, and the lore, and thematic indulgences. The sharing of armor models is a thematic thing regarding the Argent Crusade, they're &quot;uniforms&quot; in a sense. And once again people treat this like its suddenly Blizzard's new standard whilst having no evidence to that effect.<br />
<br />
Onyxia's Lair is NOT the &quot;next raid instance&quot;. May I remind you that its coming in Patch 3.2.2...a MINOR patch. These patches usually bring about a couple bug fixes and balance changes. Instead you get a whole raid instance, granted its a classic one, but who cares? The point is, if Onyxia's Lair WASN'T coming in 3.2.2, you wouldn't be getting Icecrown in its place.<br />
<br />
And Blizzard has already stated that there wasn't enough raiding in Wrath, and are doing a buttload to fix it in Cataclysm, so people can stop complaining about it now, its in the past.<br />
<br />
Again, not every patch/raid instance/whatever is gonna blow your freaking mind. Do you people honestly think Blizzard employees sit there and say &quot;OK guys, lets create the most uncreative instance we've ever done, with no new models on bosses OR gear&quot;<br />
<br />
OR...<br />
<br />
Could it be something along the lines of, &quot;Hey here's an idea for an instance that could tie in very well with the current lore; it may not be the MOST creative thing ever in terms of new models, etc. but its still a good instance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seriously, TotC is fun. The bosses are interesting, and challenging enough, and all you can say is that it sucks because they used models again?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, imagine if Blizzard did take the time to create brand new models for every boss, or even half the bosses...we'd be waiting EVEN LONGER for content than we do now. And frankly, the game probably wouldn't even make it to its 3rd expansion, they'd run out of ideas way before then.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grocalis</div><div class="date">2009-09-21, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think most people have been spoiled these days. WoW has recycled models for raid bosses since the game was released (most of Molten Core, lots of Blackwing Lair), even Kara was pretty much all recycled models (Satyr, Human, Forsaken, Worgen, etc..) and even the last boss was a recycle of the same Eredar models you beat up multiple times in Outland.<br />
<br />
They made a few good ones with totally unique models, like Naxxramas (Which 2% of players saw), Black Temple, and Sunwell, and now people seem to expect them to make unique bosses all the time. That is just not going to happen. That is why some bosses like Felmyst have to be a Frost Wyrm with some green particles instead of blue, and why the Illidari Council is just a bunch of Blood Elves. Sometimes you have to make cuts.<br />
<br />
Frankly, as a person that uses the Barbershop once a month because I like variety, and openly searches out for cosmetic pets, I think a dance studio would be great.</div></div><hr />

I think spoiled is the best word possible to describe it. Blizzard gives us a great game, it has its issues, sure, any game would. But its a great game, they're getting a &quot;free&quot; instance where there wouldn't otherwise be one, and all people can do is complain and say we want, even DESERVE, more...<br />
<br />
Yep, that about sums up &quot;spoiled&quot;.<br />

<br />
<br />
Well, Blizzard has said that the dance studio is delayed a lot because it ties up the animators, making new animations take a lot of time. Chances are, something that's 100% frill, it's probably low priority and definitely explains why this expansion is nearing an end and we still don't have this. But then again what new animations have they put into the game lately? Besides new mob types that come at the expansion (vrykul, varguls, valkyr...uh...) you usually don't see new animations in content patches.<br />
<br />
On topic, I think Blizzard is getting a little too ambitious with this. I would have been satisfied with being able to select a new dance or select multiples like /dance1 or /dance2.<br />
<br />
When they removed the pulp fiction twist female/male duo from BE's I was pissed. Napolean Dynamite is great and all, but the new dances feature had me hoping they'd have room to put it back in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't seen anyone suggest it was a standard. But lets be straight here, a new tier model requires a head and shoulder model. The time taken for that is at most a couple of days work for an experienced moddeler. The Blizz tier sets are low polygon count, simple models. Making an extra couple isn't hard.<br />

And of course, Blizzard will be more than happy to charge us for that content again. Nobody denies that Blizzard are capable of producing great content, the problem is that they have really dropped the ball with regards raid content this year, saying &quot;it won't suck next year&quot; is hardly a reassuring thought. Remember when wrath was coming out and it was going to include more and better raid content than ever. It is not unreasonable to point out that Blizz have very much failed to deliver on that promise. <br />
<br />
At best you can count TotC as being equivalent to a Zul'Aman type raid. A small raid to fill a gap. But in doing so you are left with Ulduar being the only substantial raid added to the game since Wrath released. There is also no evidence to suggest that Blizz ever planned any more raid content for the Wrath cycle. <br />

Blizzard can't have it both ways, if they want us to believe they are capable of producing more raids then they need to be doing it. <br />

You are making the same tired old straw man argument. Raiders DO love the game and DO love Blizzard as a company but that does not mean they are not entitled to make fair criticism.

<br />
<br />
But why would they make those models if they don't WANT to for thematic reasons. Again, its not that they cut corners for the sake of saving money or time. They had a theme they were going for, if it so happens that said theme is easier and cheaper, so be it.<br />
<br />
Onyxia is not a placeholder or tiding anything over, its a freebie, its not taking the place of anything. It is a raid instance where there would be nothing. Its a celebration, not a shortcut.<br />
<br />
Its number 2, they can and they have made great content. They made a mistake this year, no question. That they are aware of it, and are making a conscious effort to fix it.<br />
<br />
I'm confused about your judgement here, because you say ToC is insubstantial. But that its fun and fits. So which is it? Is it good or bad? And the majority of people haven't finished ToGC yet so its not like its already by the wayside.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haxxored</div><div class="date">2009-09-21, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Staying out of the &quot;There isn't enough raid content&quot; argument for the most part however while I think ToC is a testament to lazy design (crummy armor textures, recycled boss models, mildly interesting fight mechanist, only two rooms, and lore you literally laugh at) the hard modes have filled in the difficulty gap that many upper but not top 50 guilds seek. The only complaint I have is that Uldar hard modes are still harder than ToC heroic and that there needs to be a gear incentive to do Uldar hard modes other than the proto drake achieve.<br />
<br />
Example uldar 10 normal 219 ilvl gear uldar 10 hard mode 238 ilvl gear, Uldar 25 223 ilvl gear hard mode 245 ilvl. Then ToC normal 10 man 223 ilvl 245 heroic and ToC 25 man 238 ilvl normal 258 heroic. That way normal ToC / Uldar players still get gear but heroic gear is even better and players working on the next tier of content still may want to go back to the previous tier hard modes to gear up. Right now Uldar 25 is only worth doing for Valinar shards and doing hard modes in ToC 25 normal gear is lame since a bunch of the stuff is gonna get DEed anyways.<br />
<br />
Took much longer talking bout that than I wanted, anyways what I intended to aks is:<br />
<br />
1) IF the new dance studio is implemented can all races do all other races dances (troll picking pieces of tauren or orc dance or human doing NE dance?) or are we just stuck using emotes and animations already inherit to our starting race?<br />
<br />
2) The save feature is sharable if you use someone's saved dance profile can you go in and edit that in the studio or once saved is the profile &quot;dance only&quot; and not open to individual edits (eg get a dance from a friend but don’t like all the /train steps can I remove them but keep the rest of the dance in tact or do i need to write it all up from scratch?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But you don't know the circumstances. You can't say its &quot;lazy&quot; if you don't know the circumstances of the design.<br />
<br />
1. Blizzard says, we need a raid instance and we need it fast, lets do fewer models, a small instance, and make no new models.<br />
<br />
2. Blizzard says, we have a cool idea for a raid instance. Its not quite as much work as some instances have been, but we like the idea and we're behind it.<br />
<br />
Could the first one be the case? Sure.<br />
<br />
Could the second be the case? Absolutely.<br />
<br />
Long story short is, we don't know any more than what Blizzard says. So there's no way you can make the judgement that its lazy. I like the lore going on in ToC, I like the simplicity of it. I don't like the armor sets, but in my eyes that's a small complaint.</div></div><hr />

But they are still manhours spent on flavor crap that could be spent on worthwhile things. I dont care if they have 300 people in their Modeling and Animation department, if 5 of them are working on dances and another 5 working on pets, that's 400 manhours a week spent on stupid crap. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, a new dance system will last longer than your tier 9, and you're gonna care more about the new dances than your tier 9.</div></div><hr />

Horrid grammar aside, it happens all the time. Stuff gets pushed back, its not ready, whatever. Like its been said, the mere existence of the delay suggests that its a low priority feature. It was just an announcement trailer, its not a guarantee.<br />
<br />
Its amusing how often the community claims that Blizzard &quot;promised&quot; something, when all they ACTUALLY said was that they were &quot;working on it&quot; in the hopes of it being out at a given time. I can't remember the last time Blizzard actually &quot;Promised&quot; something.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wadark</div><div class="date">2009-09-21, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, thats it.<br />
We have no guarantee that Cataclysm will have &quot;much more Raid Content&quot; ...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Cat trailer never claimed that there would be &quot;much more&quot;. The much more came from Blizz employees directly.<br />
<br />
Also, there are already 5 known raids in Cat, and it was just announced a month ago.</div></div><hr />

I know I'm gonna spend a lot of time stoned creating the most offensive dances I can. Gnome bj dance ftw. <br />

After a month or two the studio would only be used by few. Still, as an old school RPG fan, anything like this cant be all bad.</div></div><hr />

fag aside, siege vehicles were announced just as much as the new dances <br />
i think instead of adding a new vehicle to every new content they released, they could do something new</div></div><hr />

* no, I'm not a rogue. Just tried to write a commonly known issue.<br />

Actually that would be cooler, or at least better marketing. Who on earth knows/cares about this &quot;vanish bug&quot; anyhow? Except the few people who cry about it on MMO-champ and worldofwarcraft.com forums because they can't break 1,5k rating.</div></div><hr />

Vanish is actually very, very broken. D: No qq, just stating. <br />
<br />
Though, on topic, I can't wait for this to come out Gonna have to agree on making the most offensive dances and what not~ I think it'll be seriously fun to come up with stuff. :3</div></div><hr />

<br />
when will we get them? i mean i understand why it was not released with 3.3 but hey the all serious patches are done, let's get to the fun stuff...<br />
<br />
what freaks me out most is that you ask about dances everyone is just like &quot;dances? oh well you know - look behind you there is a bear!!!&quot; *woshhhh* 'gone'<br />
<br />
there is just plain no info about it... it is like they believe we forget about it if they are silent about it long enough ...<br />
<br />
i was actually surprised not to see them as a feature in the trailer for cata...</div></div><hr />
