Legion - Varian and Vol'jin<br />
We found some interesting references to Varian and Vol'jin. Unfortunately there isn't much more than what is below yet. Keep in mind that this is just a reference in an alpha build of Legion, not something final or officially announced. Spoilers below!<br />

Obvious MMO question,What are your views on RNG systems used as stat progression?Leveling up was progression before loot tabl<br />
There can be an entitlement risk without RNG - it says if you invest enough time, you will be able to get the reward you want. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684049159666536448))<br />

PTR Update<br />
A small build went out to the PTR today, but it didn't make any significant changes, just client fixes. <br />

No really though, It's about time the Horde got a leader with some interesting stuff going on rather than Green Jesus or Evil pig, She isnt black and white which is nice. I just hope they don't pull another Garrosh and lead her down a very obvious spiraling decline. In fact, I'm hoping she will actually be portrayed as the victim of the whole stormheim conflict, which it looks like she will be. The horde needed the chance to be on a moral high horse for once, as did the Alliance to be the aggressor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There can be an entitlement risk without RNG - it says if you invest enough time, you will be able to get the reward you want. <br />
<br />
That's such a bogus line. RNG is exactly the same except that the &quot;time invested&quot; is artificially, in most cases, lengthened substantially. Either way, you deal with &quot;entitlement,&quot; which I know in the USA has been a lovely go-to word in politics and everywhere else as a bad word.<br />
<br />
There's absolutely nothing wrong with desiring control. There's nothing wrong with desiring a finite &quot;end&quot; to your progression. I think part of the reason people are so angry in general about this stuff is that Blizzard keeps dangling everything above the basest level of gear behind RNG walls so that you can never &quot;max&quot; out your toon because, well, now time to try and get random jewel slots/tertiaries/etc.<br />

Killing important figures in lore leaves more space for others stories and maybe other leaders left in a stale state like Tyrande or Baine. If you keep them alive all the time for the sake of it, you just get a lot of Thrall 2.0<br />
<br />
It was about time they start killing characters off, we've been at war with pretty much everything for 10+ years. Wrath would have felt 10x more epic if important charcaters actually DIED instead of &quot;lol arthas we roflstomped ur army with close to none loss, and now we at ur gate&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baine is still quite young in the eyes of the Horde. I have a feeling we are going to see Sylvanas go off the deep end at some point and either get killed herself or pull a Garrosh and break off into a separate faction leaving the Forsaken either without a leader or a new leader to emerge. Remember, Sylvanas was so distraught when Arthas died that she committed suicide (well sort of since she is already dead) and it was the valkyrs that brought her back. She has proven to be very unstable but since she was the leader present when the isle invasion took place she kind of just picked up the reigns and lead. I just hope we dont get garrosh 2.0 where she becomes the end boss of an expansion and we fight her for 18 months.</div></div><hr />

I think we all know Sylvanas isn't someone who should be the leader of the Horde, but that would be awfully terrible writing to have her go the way of Garrosh. Only instead of a potential good Warchief, we already know she's terrible. So unless her role is &quot;bad going good&quot; and not the way Garrosh's story went, I would have to shake my head at her being the &quot;end boss&quot; of an expansion titled &quot;Legion&quot; Maybe a boss, but final boss? That's just stupid and boring. Killed Garrosh, killed all these Warlords, now killing Sylvanas? Meh</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's be honest, Horde is bad at picking Warchiefs.<br />
<br />
Vol'Jin was a known traitor who backstabbed Garrosh without provacation and then whined when he was punished for doing so.<br />
<br />
His two victories (Echo Isle and SoO) happened not due to his leadership. On the contrary, both of those would have failed if he hadn't been saved, in both cases, multiple times (Echo isle was druids saving him -and- divine intervention. SoO was the Alliance saving him. Twice). <br />
<br />
Even in Pandaria he had to be saved. Multiple times. <br />
<br />
Out of all the leaders of the Horde, he had the absolute least reason to be made Warchief. Out of all the leaders of the game he has proven to be the least capable.<br />

Only instead of a potential good Warchief, we already know she's terrible. So unless her role is &quot;bad going good&quot; and not the way Garrosh's story went, I would have to shake my head at her being the &quot;end boss&quot; of an expansion titled &quot;Legion&quot; Maybe a boss, but final boss? That's just stupid and boring. Killed Garrosh, killed all these Warlords, now killing Sylvanas? Meh<br />
<br />
She has proven to be shitty person, but a decent leader, actually. <br />
<br />
But yes, Lor'Themar or even Baine would make more sense. Saurfang would make the most sense of all, since even the Alliance respects him.</div></div><hr />

It is kind of stupid that Blizz always kills faction leaders/ lore characters from both side at the same time. Beginning of cata they killed Magni and Cairne Bloodhoof, end of MoP they killed Nazgrim then his alliance counter part Admiral Taylor at WoD launch. Now they are killing Vol'jin and Varian. It seems they always kill faction leaders/ major lore characters in pairs so retards won't whine about favoritism. Its a game from which a corporation is making money, I don't understand how can people even think about favoritism.</div></div><hr />

The stuff written about Garrosh, Vol'jin and what happened after Thrall left is really bad. The books, which are not really good either, tell a slightly better story.<br />
The Vol'jin in the books is a military genius, while the ingame Vol'jin isn't even existing in most of the story lines, but the same works for Garrosh, Thrall, Baine, Cairne and all the other major characters.<br />
It totally made sense to make Vol'jin warchief because Cairne died after the treason and he is the only character left who could lead the horde, who is smart and who wants to continue what Thrall achieved. He has the same goals as Thrall and Cairne.<br />
<br />
I know Vol'Jin was in that MoP book, but I dont remember him being anywhere near a military genious in that book. At most he was showing basic competency. Then in the war crimes novel he's outed a treasonous bastard by Baine himself. <br />
<br />
One show of competency in a book where he has to be saved due to his incompetence does not make up for constant failure before and after.</div></div><hr />

There's absolutely nothing wrong with desiring control. There's nothing wrong with desiring a finite &quot;end&quot; to your progression. I think part of the reason people are so angry in general about this stuff is that Blizzard keeps dangling everything above the basest level of gear behind RNG walls so that you can never &quot;max&quot; out your toon because, well, now time to try and get random jewel slots/tertiaries/etc.<br />

Vol'Jin has been a shitty character. The biggest thing is that he's very dishonest.<br />

... So Vol'jin gets one expansion and does pretty much nothing before getting offed. Well, guess that's proof Blizzard hates trolls. Guess that leaves the question if Sylvanas will be an effective warchief or if someone will replace her after Legion (either by force or her willingly stepping down) which could mean Thrall may retake the warchief mantle when Legion ends. Thrall gets injured which results in him giving Doomhammer up and Vol'jin dies leaving Sylvanas in charge. Why keep Thrall alive if he isn't going to retake the warchief mantle? I doubt Blizzard's going to let Baine or Lor'themar step up into that position and the Horde being led by goblins? LOL! That's like the gnomes taking over the Alliance.<br />
<br />
Varian funeral demon attack? That's just ... bizarre. So does that mean Varian comes back as a dreadlord or something? Or is Blizzard using demon in place of bunny this expansion and it's really the trigger for Varian's funeral ... although the attack makes less sense in that case unless demons raid his funeral? Kind of sucks it'll be part of the pre-expansion event in either case. You can potentially only see it once and never again. I honestly hate one time events since I sometimes want to go back later on and do them again.<br />
<br />
Rather irritating Blizzard would pretty much do the 5.1 patch largely dedicated (alliance side anyway) to Varian's development as king only to have him do nothing in WoD and then kill him. Starting to wonder what's the point to get invested in characters anymore. Find one I like or start to like and they either get forgotten, become something I hate, or get killed off. Good way to make me lose interest is to kill off characters I like. Legion's already made me skeptical. It's rare if I see a series pull off killing major characters. If anything, it's often the death knell for the show. While The Walking Dead pulls it off, that's the nature of the genre. Game of Thrones is also an oddity. Most series can't pull off killing a major part of their cast without massive backlash and lost interest. Guess Blizzard's catering to the crowd who cares nothing for the lore or the characters. They won't care if someone dies and gets replaced with someone else because they likely never read the quests, etc anyway. Meanwhile, those of us that do care are likely in the minority and Blizzard won't care if we get pissed and leave.<br />
<br />
The felsaber looks terrible. And seeing it only reaffirms the idea that is uses the same skeleton/animations as the demonsaber which explains why the demonsaber looks like it has a spine issue or a brain injury. Also rather stupid that demon hunters are effectively getting two of the same mount. Only difference is model. They haven't done that since vanilla with paladins and warlocks. I would have preferred a ground mount and a flying mount, not two ground mounts.</div></div><hr />

They actually never finished Varians questline in MoP, it just kinda ends. Either they didnt have time (likely since 5.3 was cut content: the patch), or they were responding to the negative response it was receiving at the time (Varian was being made up as better than everyone). <br />
<br />
Vol'Jin though likely isnt dead. He has a history of running away when danger rears its ugly head.<br />

I hope that we find out that Sylvanas has betrayed everyone, she did have a legion pit demon as an advisor back in the first 3 expansions.<br />
<br />
Varian is Lo'gosh's champion as stated in Wolfheart, and Vol'jin has no other troll that would be taking his place for the Darkspear, Vol'jin was the subject of the book 'Shadows of the Horde' the only troll who would convince his own tribe not to side with the Zandalari, who knows what's going to happen there. It makes no sense, if they want to make Anduin into a King Arthur type, it won't work in my POV. i'd rather the two be in a death-like coma until the last part of legion when they awaken to lead their factions to victory over the Legion.<br />

I hope they scrap this like they did when they planned to make Yrel and Maraad as lovers in the Alpha stage of WoD, only for Yrel to lead the Dran after losing her teacher, Prophet Velen in Shadowmoon, and Maraad at the battle of Shattrach, or Vol'jin and Varian come back with the following remark, 'The news about my own death has been known to have been greatly exaggerately.'</div></div><hr />

100% right, the people really think the rest of the Horde and Alliance leaders will say &quot;Sylvanas Warchieft? ok&quot;?? the reaction with Garrosh was negative, Sylvanas must be the same, not &quot;im fine with the queen of the undeads as leader&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why Blizzard is listening to Thrall-haters when the best time of Lore was with Thrall as Warchief and since they tried to take him out everything went to the sewers.<br />
<br />
Clearly, you've rewritten history in your own head, or you've seemed to have forgotten the events of Cataclysm when Thrall earned his nickname, Green Jesus, for being an ever present protagonist. Not only was Thrall the Warchief, but also the make-shift Earth Warden. Everywhere players turned, Thrall was present, taking glory for himself as a well placed Mary Sue would even until Draenor where he stole the revenge on Garrosh from the players in Nagrand. <br />
<br />
The players' frustration with Thrall is justified.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There can be an entitlement risk without RNG - it says if you invest enough time, you will be able to get the reward you want.<br />
<br />
Uh... yes? I think you should get the reward you want if you invest enough time. Maybe RNG would let you get lucky and get it earlier, but there should be a point when you can trade in your points and get a thing.</div></div><hr />

Re-read my post, specially this part &quot;the best time of Lore was with Thrall as Warchief and since they tried to take him out everything went to the sewers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now let's see what you post: &quot;or you've seemed to have forgotten the events of Cataclysm when Thrall earned his nickname, Green Jesus, for being an ever present protagonist&quot;<br />
<br />
Now try to think about it.<br />
<br />
I repeat, the best time of Lore was with Thrall as Warchief, Blizzard needs to stop fooling around and get him back where he belongs, not to a World Shaman, not to a Quest giver, not to a kill stealer, to the place he belongs, WARCHIEF.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is complete BS...<br />
Yeah that's what I meant with my comment :( Shame they didn't do any development on him at all. Wasted potential!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fritters154</div><div class="date">2016-01-07, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But yes, Lor'Themar or even Baine would make more sense. Saurfang would make the most sense of all, since even the Alliance respects him.<br />
<br />
Seriously, why is Saurfang not Warchief yet? He was even at SoO so Blizz could have just given him the appointment back then. He has basically been the Horde's highest military commander since Vanilla and the orcs at least tend to favor military leaders for societal leaders. While Vol'jin wasn't a particularly terrible choice for alleviating tension between the Horde and Alliance after Garrosh happened, the guy who actually led the Might of Kalimdor (combined factions) and led the Horde assault on the scourge (shared enemy) would have been a better choice. The mark against him would be his absence form the actual campaign against the Iron Horde and Legion during WoD and him only taking part as a quest giver. <br />
<br />
Vol'jin as Warchief never really felt like a difference because Blizz changed very little. It should have been a radical change but trolls are still relegated to a corner of Org and there are some guards around Org. Aside from that, we pretty much just got random shadow hunters thrown at us in WoD questing but none had nearly as much build up as questing orcs in the past like Nazgrim or Garrosh (pre-warchief) or both Saurfangs.<br />
<br />
Side note: Where is AU Saurfang? He was active at the same time as Orgrim, Blackhand, Durotan, Grom, etc. in the MU but is just completely absent in the AU?</div></div><hr />

Not because I think Sylvanas is a bad character, but because Vol'jin was hyped so much since Cata going into MoP and after seeing him become Warchief at the end of SOO I was excited to see what he'd do in WoD...which was not very much. So I figured he might get time to shine in Legion; but if he's going to die then I doubt it.<br />

I don't mind Varian dying because he's had character development and a time for players to form a bond with him.</div></div><hr />

I'm honestly just so tired of the Horde Leadership being a revolving door. Thrall was in for Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath, Garrosh for Cata and Mists, and now Vol'jin for Warlords.<br />
<br />
If trends continue Sylvanas won't even last half an expansion before she gets toppled or killed off. She's beyond redemption at this point-once she was shown that her actions would lead to damnation, she chose to prolong damnation instead of choosing a different path.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard makes the same mistake time and time again. They try to do whats cool rather than writing their own narrative. So the plot suffers and has no direction. <br />
<br />
This is the same thing that happened to Garrosh. People bitched about him in WotLk so come by Cata release Blizzard decided to dethrone him rather than flesh out his character. Now its Vol'jin's turn.</div></div><hr />

I think Sylvanas is an interesting character, it could be cool. I don't see her as warchief for the long haul, not that I would mind that, I just don't see Blizzard doing it. I'd like to see the forsaken in the spotlight a bit more with her as the acting leader of the Horde, I think that could be pretty cool and bring some interesting story lines.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't make sense... i mean<br />
<br />
Sylvanas worked with Varian in the trailer and even saved him from the Infernal, why would she kill him after that?</div></div><hr />

He's definitely going to be MIA, hold a funeral for him because they cannot find his body and just assume he is, until potentially later on show up and found a weakness or something that can hinder the Legion's plan to conquer us. As for this 'Varian's funeral demon attack', it sounds like a GoT style of a Red Wedding. If they plan for that, expect a lot more important people perishing.</div></div><hr />

Because I main alliance :rolleyes:<br />

<br />
No really though, It's about time the Horde got a leader with some interesting stuff going on rather than Green Jesus or Evil pig, She isnt black and white which is nice. I just hope they don't pull another Garrosh and lead her down a very obvious spiraling decline. In fact, I'm hoping she will actually be portrayed as the victim of the whole stormheim conflict, which it looks like she will be. The horde needed the chance to be on a moral high horse for once, as did the Alliance to be the aggressor.<br />
<br />
I'm honestly hoping they make her the most successful warchief.</div></div><hr />

Sure this must be the reason why he is overdue with his next books/scripts für GoT - he secretly writes the WoW lore :)<br />
<br />
We need strong female characters in every genre I think - not only in films, music, politics etc. also in games and what not else- with this it would make sense that blizzard hops on the train and bring some &quot;strong&quot; female characters - was that not a reason why the film was rejected somehow beacause of the lack of female main charcters?</div></div><hr />

Blizzard would be bets if they forget the crappy lore they built up in Cataclysm and go back to Thrall as Warchief,<br />
<br />
Garrosh didnt work, Vol'jin didnt work, they stupidly killed Cairne which was the only other tan Thrall that would have worked, Sylvannas as Warchief makes no sense, Baine wouldnt have the support of the people being so young and new, and Lor´themar and galliwyx have as mch sense as Sylvannas, which is none.<br />

Vol'jin is probably not dead, but he should give the Warchief mantle to the true owner of it, so we can have good lore again.</div></div><hr />

MoP lore was good, is true that Garrosh was a bad warchief, but that doesn't make the lore bad, also... we all know that Sylvanas is Warchief, cause... well... WAR, she's the leader with the best military background right now, and Thrall basically said &quot;Fuck it&quot; (still we don't know the details of why Thrall goes like that, i guess we will find out soon(tm))</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sylvannas is the leader with the worst military background. Her military background is going into ICC and leaving her backup behind and sending wave after wave of undead to die under the Gilneas Gates without gaining anything......<br />
<br />
She has no clue about tactics or strategy and has no care about her own troops.<br />
<br />
Don't know where people are getting that Sylvannas is a good war leader. She never won anything.<br />
<br />
And yes, Thrall said &quot;fuck it&quot; without making any sense in an expansion that we are all trying to forget because it destroyed the WoW lore and led us to having terrible lore for years.<br />
<br />
Even Varian knew at the end of MoP that the new Warchief should have been Thrall, it was the only that made any sense, but Blizzard keeps listening to the clueless people that said Thrall was not a good Warchief, when in reality the Thrall stupid lore started when he stopped being one.<br />
<br />
Everything the horde has was earned when Thrall was Warchief, Vol'jin earned nothing, Garrosh lost stuff, and Sylvannas never earned anything (more so, lets not forget that she was an undead part of the scourge because she wouldn't even be able to defend herself or know when to retreat).<br />
<br />
Thrall is the Horde real Warchief, he is my only Warchief, i dont care what the stupid writes Blizzard has since Cataclysm say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The alliance has probably even worser storybackground, there are no traitors anymore or evil alliance faction leaders and humans. Perenolde was back in wc2 and deathwing did not yet exist so it appears it was just a human faction leader turn traitor.<br />
<br />
Instead, we got an overpowered Varian who knows no defeat and never was turned mad, stayed calm especially since cata.<br />
<br />
So yeah, do me a favor and kill them ALL. Bring new characters that are interesting and not so 1 dimensional.</div></div><hr />

Why do you blame Sylvanas for what she did to the worgens?, what options did she have? drop down and die? you know that the Forsaken were forced into that war by Garrosh, because he wanted to have the Forsaken annihilated (reason why he said &quot;NO!&quot; to the plague), i mean... i'm pretty sure there are other things people could blame Sylvanas with, but they always say the same (Gilneas was not her fault, -not like Genn cares or anything- )</div></div><hr />

Not like they had many options, if she retreated, her country would have fallen without much of a problem and that, would have been, treason<br />

She was there too, and didnt stopped Garrosh. Thrall would have stopped him if he went and send his people to die meaningless.<br />

We do know why, because Blizzard writers suck and they listen to stupid people asking Thrall not to be Warchief. And since there is no logical reason why Thrall shouldn't be Warchief, they need him to say &quot;fuck it&quot; as a reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not like they had many options, if she retreated, her country would have fallen without much of a problem and that, would have been, treason<br />
<br />
<br />
She lost it anyway and ended up as part of the enemy army. Sometimes, retreating is the best option.<br />
<br />
Sylvannas was never a good strategist or tactician, and most of the time she wasn't a good leader anyway.<br />
<br />
Again, she went rogue in one of the most powerfull enemy strongholds<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well.... nothing i can say about that, he's your Warchief, but not the Warchief of the Horde anymoe<br />
<br />
He is the Warchief of the horde. No one respected Garrosh as Warchief since it was clearly a joke, and very few people respect Vol'jin as it.<br />
<br />
Now, could you please back up your claims of Sylvannas being a good Warchief? What did she accomplished besides losing battle after battle during her entire story?<br />
<br />
How can her achievements even compare to Thrall's ones?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shambulanced</div><div class="date">2016-01-08, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Thrall was good as an early leader of the Horde, to unite races together, but that eventually he found strands unraveling and the actual business of &quot;ruling&quot; a faction to be challenging at best, impossible at worst. The Horde has always been interesting (and volatile) because so many of its alliances are self-serving/convenient, versus the Alliance which tends to have an &quot;All for one and one for all&quot; mentality. That's why it consistently feels like Horde gets better story--there's more conflict, less hugs and kum-ba-ya circles.<br />
<br />
I think Thrall has lost his will largely because he WAS green Jesus, for years and years (in the WC universe)--and the moment he tries to put other people in his place (Garrosh) it falls apart--which leads him to question his own judgment and leadership ability, and question whether or not the world will ever &quot;be okay&quot; without him. So, he tosses Doomhammer aside, and says; &quot;forget it. Good luck.&quot; Who knows, maybe the elements fail to answer his call because his self-doubt becomes crippling and that's what causes him to turn away. Maybe he dies! We don't know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard makes the same mistake time and time again. They try to do whats cool rather than writing their own narrative. So the plot suffers and has no direction. <br />
<br />
This is the same thing that happened to Garrosh. People bitched about him in WotLk so come by Cata release Blizzard decided to dethrone him rather than flesh out his character. Now its Vol'jin's turn.<br />
<br />
A means to the only end she has, she will take the forsaken into the bitter end, the undead and forsaken can not go away until the Burning Legion is gone, Bolvar knows this and it is why he has dedicated himself to eradicating the Legion now, you are going to see some shit now that he is almost fully awake and that he will not let ANYONE stand in his way of the Legions destruction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that's the thing, its a stupid reaction that someone that was a great leader will never have.<br />
<br />
The only of his old friends that helped him forge the Horde that still remain goes missing (Vol'jin) and instead of taking the matter into his hands and lead the horde into seeking him he says &quot;Fuck it&quot;?????<br />
<br />
Seriously, its like the end of MoP all over again, he knew he was the one that had to lead the horde after Garrosh almost destroying it, and to not go into an all war agaisnt the Alliance, yet he gives Vol'jin, who never led anything more than a tiny troll faction, to lead the horde in its more difficult times?<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to stop forcing stupid stuff just so that Thrall doesnt come back, and Metzen needs to fulfill his promise that we would get our Warchief back, which he hasn't yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that was my point--he was a great liberator and good at forming the Horde, but over time his leadership failed. I think he's an inspirational figure--so a good leader, but to lead multiple factions you also need to be a good manager, which, from appointments to resource allocation etc, he has proven time and time again that he is lacking.<br />
<br />
I don't think he's a great Warchief and I especially don't think he's what the Horde needs, now. <br />

She wasn't, read her short story, when she came back, the invasion already started, and not like she could just deny Garrosh order, because... he was her warchief, is was that, or become an enemy of the Horde too, when she came back, she took the control of the battlefield out of Garrosh hands<br />

I don't knowhat you are talking about. Thrall leadership never failed except one time, when he appointed the stupid Garrosh as Warchief.<br />
<br />
He might made mistakes, but his leadership never failed.<br />
<br />
And seriously, the other leaders have shown more failure than him, lets not forget that Thrall had to save Vol'jin, lets not forget that Sylvannas was in the enemy army because he failed at keeping herself and her people alive, lets not forget that Lor'themar got his capital overrun, Baine is just a kid and Galliwyx... well, i dont think i have to say anything about him.<br />
<br />
Thrall made one mistake as a leader, which was Garrosh, he is by far the most capable leader in the Horde (and in the entire Warcraft lore) and its stupid to have him doing stuff he doesnt need to.<br />
<br />
He doesnt even need to do anything as World Shaman, since he could take enough time to go who knows how much time to an alternate universe without the world ending...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thrall put Gallywix into power, incidentally, so there's a second strike.<br />
<br />
Under his rule he failed to keep tabs on Sylvanas, who in turn failed to keep tabs on Varimathras/Putress, which led to the disaster at Wrathgate.<br />
<br />
He didn't just put Garrosh into power, he continually allowed Garrosh to grow, poorly, into that power. There's an entire thread elsewhere dedicated to defending Garrosh and pinning the blame on Thrall. I don't know where I come down on that debate, but both sides believe they're 100% correct, so.<br />
<br />
In the business/professional world, there's a lot of research and study done on leaders, managers, and what the difference is. In my post I stated that Thrall has been a decent leader, but ultimately fails greatly as a manager.<br />
<br />
To run a faction truly successfully, you need to be both--or you need to at least make appointments that cover your weaknesses. Thrall did neither. I like him as a character but you and I will have to agree to disagree--I don't think he's the Warchief that the Horde needs right now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crashdummy</div><div class="date">2016-01-08, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">She wasn't, read her short story, when she came back, the invasion already started, and not like she could just deny Garrosh order, because... he was her warchief, is was that, or become an enemy of the Horde too, when she came back, she took the control of the battlefield out of Garrosh hands<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, had it being Thrall, he would have taken control of his troops out of Garrosh, i mean, he basically did that when he took his people away from the old horde.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But you're claiming things that did not happen<br />
<br />
<br />
No i'm not, you are the one saying Sylvannas is some kind of war leader without giving any example of her doing something even remotely close to show good leadership, while i gave examples of the contrary.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Retreating and letting your people die? yes... great idea, so... i guess Uther was also a fool, and Bolvar, and and and .... <br />
<br />
<br />
You are trolling, right? Uther was betrayed by Arthas, he never had a chance to retreat with his people alive, and Bolvar got bombarded from a cliff from people he considered being in a truce...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What?... you really didn't play Cataclysm... i mean... many people cried that the Horde (the forsaken) won almost all their battle in Cata and that it was Horde bias!<br />
<br />
Forsaken didn't won any battle, they just spreaded a plague, that's how they gain the little territory they gained in Cata (like Hillsbrad).<br />
<br />
As far as battles go, Sylvannas always failed. And as far as leadership, she went rogue in the enemy stronghold when she should have led.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Thrall put Gallywix into power, incidentally, so there's a second strike.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thrall freed the Goblins in his way to the maelstrom and appointed the only possible candidate because he couldnt stay to do anything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Under his rule he failed to keep tabs on Sylvanas, who in turn failed to keep tabs on Varimathras/Putress, which led to the disaster at Wrathgate.<br />
<br />
<br />
He kept tabs on Sylvanas quite well while he was Warchief, it was Sylvanas the one that failed to keep tabs on her own people, that's not Thralls fault.<br />
Although he, as a leader, took responsability in dealing with it, as it happened in Battle for Undercity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He didn't just put Garrosh into power, he continually allowed Garrosh to grow, poorly, into that power. There's an entire thread elsewhere dedicated to defending Garrosh and pinning the blame on Thrall. I don't know where I come down on that debate, but both sides believe they're 100% correct, so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, Garrosh was his mistake, his only mistake.<br />

<br />
He was running it succesfully, under his leadership the Horde only grew more powerful. If you want to take it to the business world, he is a great leader, manager and CEO. He made one bad human resource decision (and only one, because in trusting Cairne and Vol'jin in W3 he was correct, and so was corect in trusting the Blood Elves when they joined).<br />
<br />
He is the perfect Warchief for the horde right now, one that have balance and that is not an idiot that will want to go against the Alliance or with personal vengeances when we have the Legion threat right in front of us, something that Sylvanas already proved she cant put aside personal vengeances.<br />
<br />
Thrall already proved he is the best leader in the whole Warcraft Lore, the problem is that Blizzard writers cant write even a kids fairy tale.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not like the Forsaken had many allies, remember that they were not trusted thanks to what happened in Wrath Gates (and yes, Sylvanas took the control of her troops out of Garrosh... When she arrived)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No i'm not, you are the one saying Sylvannas is some kind of war leader without giving any example of her doing something even remotely close to show good leadership, while i gave examples of the contrary.<br />
<br />
Examples of what?<br />
<br />
1) She retook Lordaeron<br />
2) She retook Silverspine forest<br />
3) Beat the Alliance out of Andorhal<br />
4) Took control of Hillsbrad Foothills<br />
5) Helped a lot in the fight against the Lich King<br />
and so on...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You are trolling, right? Uther was betrayed by Arthas, he never had a chance to retreat with his people alive, and Bolvar got bombarded from a cliff from people he considered being in a truce...<br />
<br />
<br />
Uther fought Arthas near Terenas grave, and died by his hand...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Forsaken didn't won any battle, they just spreaded a plague, that's how they gain the little territory they gained in Cata (like Hillsbrad).<br />
<br />
<br />
More than what the alliance can say (Not only Hillsbrad as mentioned above)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as battles go, Sylvannas always failed. And as far as leadership, she went rogue in the enemy stronghold when she should have led.<br />
<br />
What do you mean? she went rogue with the Scourge? she was never a faithful servant of the Scourge like Kelthuzad, in the end, that was the point, Arthas even rised her different from the others, he left her with her &quot;humanity&quot; just to make her suffer, just to make her be aware of every hit she gave against her people and so on...<br />

<br />
1) The Blood Elves got in the Horde thanks to the Forsaken (Sylvanas to be more specific)<br />
2) Hey i'm not saying that Thrall is a bad leader, i think he's a better leader than Sylvanas, but right now... they need a war commander.<br />
3) Not like she have anyone else to take vengeance upon :P<br />
4) In Legion, Genn start the battle against the Horde out of vengeance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Serious note...I am thinking these are not &quot;real&quot; funerals ..more just ,&quot; hey we can't find a body and haven't heard from them in a good while SOOOO we are calling them dead so we can get new leadership and carry on..&quot; thing.<br />
I like Voljin as a supporting npc so I would hate to see him Dead...as I would surmise many H side players would as well.<br />
Allie side...I would also hate to see a main npc (no matter if I liked him or not) to die in a &quot;wreck&quot; more or less, to my mind 1st 2nd or 3rd string NPC's deserve a glorious,dramatic death...I think Garrosh's death was ...meh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this is just a reference in an alpha build of Legion, not something final or officially announced.<br />
<br />
The only thing known at this point is that Vol'jin is MIA. As for Varian, there was nothing in the alpha as to his status -- he was still standing in his usual spot in Stormwind, so if there is an event it's most likely phased. We'll just have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bakaokami</div><div class="date">2016-01-09, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously, barring the off-chance that this is a quest with a super misleading name, this absolutely terrible writing. Vol'jin becomes warchief at the very, very end of MoP. In the entirety of WoD, he has essentially two lines where he congratulates you in your garrison. Guy might as well have been absent through the whole expansion.<br />
<br />
Now in Legion, he's dead? Even if he's just assumed dead, he'll probably be gone for the whole expansion and the mantle of warchief will inevitably pass to someone else.<br />
<br />
They took the most important position in the entire horde and made it mean nothing. Hell, we haven't had a warchief that we were supposed to sympathize with and that actually had a presence in the story since WotLK. Not to mention that he's basically the only character with a recognizable name in the entire race of Darkspear trolls. I can't believe that someone writing for the most popular MMO in the world thought that this was a good idea.</div></div><hr />

There is no place of Sylvanas be warchief, no fucking way, most of the races of the Horde is already difficult to be controlled, by their own kind, they NEVER would subordinate to an undead (excluding the passive blood elves)<br />

The problem with Garrosh, is that he made the ORCS stronger, not the Horde also... Sylvanas is most likely a temporal warchief cause Vol'jin is MIA, she's basically the Warchief, cause she's a great war commander... <br />
<br />
(Also... if you don't want your friends to rebel against you, try not to point your sword at them)</div></div><hr />

still there is no way the others races follow her, only if the sky open and thrall come and say to everyone follow her<br />
<br />
1- the orcs still dint have a racial leader, most of the chieftains have their own kind of business, she cant control all by force <br />
<br />
the only racional and right choice is put Saurfang as warchief, or at least racial leader, and the warchief post be empty</div></div><hr />

Well... she may not be the most beloved leader, but i'm pretty sure the other horde races at least appreciate her as a great asset in combat, and right now... that's what they need, remember that they are fighthing the Legion.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean that all her decisions will be fully accepted, there could be many things that are questioned by the other members of the Horde</div></div><hr />

Side note: Where is AU Saurfang? He was active at the same time as Orgrim, Blackhand, Durotan, Grom, etc. in the MU but is just completely absent in the AU?<br />
<br />
In the cut scene at the end of the Garrosh fight in SoO, I was hoping to see him at the big reveal. I love his answer in Warsong hold when original Garrosh asks how Saurfang deals with his memories: &quot;I don't eat pork.&quot; :p<br />
<br />
AU Saurfang is standing in my Garrison as I write this, can't recall if I've seen him elsewhere. Was hoping to see Broxigar too, he's awesomesauce.<br />
<br />
And if they do indeed kill off Vol'jin, I have one question.... who's going to open the ceremonial keg at Brewfest, hmmm? HMMMMMM? :p</div></div><hr />
