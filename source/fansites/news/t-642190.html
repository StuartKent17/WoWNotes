Noblegarden moved to April 26th on PTRs<br />
As announced earlier, the Noblegarden World Event has been rescheduled (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16102341510-noblegarden-rescheduled.html). It looks like the new date is April 26th according to the latest build. The Noblegarden was revamped in patch 3.1 and is now part of the meta-achievement for the Violet Proto-Drake, a lot of achievemvents have been added to the event (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=837) as well. <br />

Blue posts<br />
Blizzard's new MMO<br />
We haven't announced anything on the new project. We probably won't for awhile. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137614841-new-mmo.html))<br />
<br />
Game design teams and forums<br />
1) Kalgan is still here on WoW. We discuss the game design every single day. He is behind all of the changes we make.<br />
2) The design team makes all of our decisions by consensus. It's a slow process, but it means there are no I-told-you-sos down the road. That portion of the team that doesn't post here doesn't get enough credit for all of the enormous contributions that they make. It kind of sucks. <br />
3) The WoW forums have a storied tradition of attacking the messenger when they don't like the message. When Kalgan posted a lot, players attacked him too. Whether it's me or someone else posting here two or whenever years from now, they will become the new most hated person in WoW. <br />
4) We don't let it bother us. You can't in this business. It's important to us to communicate with the players, and the forums are one way to do that. We just ban the players that can't control themselves and like to spew garbage instead of discussing the game. <br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
&quot;What's the point of 10-Man Hard Mode? Almost all the serious raiders are in 25-Man&quot;<br />
We actually don't know if this is true or not. Or more specifically, there were 40 player guilds in vanilla because that's all we offered. Then there were 25 player guilds for BC because that's all we offered. We had a lot of data and feedback that there are a lot of players who would prefer to run with a smaller group of friends even if the content was very challenging. As I said, we will see if 10 player guilds are more casual or if there are a lot of 10 player guilds who are up to hardcore challenges. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137184090-4-years-of-wow.html))<br />
<br />
Naxxramas difficulty<br />
Knowing what we know now, I'd hazard to guess that we would make Naxx 25 (and definitely Sarth 25) more difficult if we could do it over again, as well as dropping less loot per boss. But our model remains that the first tier of raiding should not be a brick wall for the majority of guilds who want to raid. Thaddius, 4H, Saph and KT are a lot more difficult for the average pug than the rest of Naxx. Maybe they should have been the model for all the bosses so that groups weren't surprised when they killed Anub'Rekhan on the first or second attempt. But, again, if you like wiping and wiping before you finally manage the kill, there will be plenty of chances for that in Ulduar and Icecrown. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137184090-4-years-of-wow.html))<br />
<br />
Raid composition in Ulduar<br />
Nah, I think you are looking at two extremes: trivial content vs. raid stacking. The cutting-edge guilds who have tried Ulduar so far had a really good mix of classes. Will there be more complaints (legit and QQ) about Ulduar balance? Absolutely. But we think it is a lot closer than it was in BT or Sunwell. DPS, tanking and healing are all closer and the raid buff design doesn't encourage stacking nearly to the BC degree. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137184090-4-years-of-wow.html))<br />
<br />
Trash Mobs<br />
Strong raiding guilds care about trash. Trash can still wipe you, especially in Ulduar. TK trash was harder than a couple of the bosses. If you clear trash slowly, you might fail a speed run or fail to get one more shot on a boss that night. I can understand how a character who sucks at bosses but excels at trash would not be attractive. But trash matters. If it didn't, we wouldn't include it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137184090-4-years-of-wow.html))<br />
<br />
Multi-boxing in raids<br />
The number of multi-boxers is trivial. If you are a hardcore player you may know several of them, but in the grand scheme there are very few people really doing that.<br />
<br />
If you want to discuss parts of the game that disappoint you, that's something I am interested in. Trying to argue that the metrics by which the business success of WoW is measured are somehow specious is a waste of your time. WoW is doing very well -- better than it ever has. That doesn't mean we can't improve the experience, which is why I'm still here in this thread. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137184090-4-years-of-wow.html))<br />

Tanking nerfed in 3.1<br />
DKs were too good on Sartharion, but that wasn't the intent and we nerfed them. Will they have a slight advantage on some fights? Probably. That will be true of other tanks as well. Do we expect most raids to tank with a DK? No. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137184090-4-years-of-wow.html))<br />

Druid original design<br />
I understand what you're trying to say with that last part, but the truth is our original design was that if druids want to raid, they have to heal. Our BC design was okay, you can try and raid with the other druid specs, but you are going to be inferior to other classes in tanking, casting or melee dps. We heard from plenty of druids who thought that was a terrible design and over time we decided we agreed and changed our vision for how raiding works.

Frost Mage in PvE<br />
We think Frost mage PvE dps is still probably too low. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137184090-4-years-of-wow.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=630) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?rogue))<br />
Backstab Glyph in 3.1<br />
There was a bug that happened between the Backstab glyph and the Dirty Deeds talent. This bug caused all damage, not just Backstab, to do extra damage to stunned targets. This was not the intent.<br />
<br />
However, we had been balancing Subtelty for the last few weeks around damage numbers inflated by this bug. We realized when we fixed the bug that Subtelty dps might drop too much. To try and prevent that from happening, we buffed the bonus damage of Sinister Calling.<br />
<br />
Rogue talents can be pretty complicated on the developer side. Often one talent has to have a special case to handle the effects of another talent. It is sometimes difficult to detect the bugs that are caused by two talents (or glyphs or set bonuses or buffs or whatever) acting in tandem.<br />
<br />
Hope that explains it. <br />
<br />
Are the developers aware that Sub is not the only tree with inflated numbers due to this bug? <br />
<br />
Yeah. That was the problem. We nerfed Mutilate on purpose. This wasn't supposed to &quot;fix&quot; it.<br />
<br />
We didn't attempt to compensate Subtelty for PvE because not many of them should have been running with the Backstab glyph for PvE unless you are really struggling with trash for some reason.<br />
<br />
Some rogues do use Subtelty for PvP. As I've said before, it seems more popular in Europe and Asia than in North America. One article I read suggested that the build is super-dependent on coordination with your team members and tried to make some kind of cultural connection to that playstyle, but I get uncomfortable trying to characterize people that broadly.

OOMcast: Episode 2<br />
I don't post a lot of podcasts but OOMCast (http://www.outofmana.org/oom/) is a new one and looks fairly interesting. I don't usually post that kind of stuff and your feedback would be appreciated on this one, depending on how popular it is I might post that kind of video every now and then. You can also leave your opinion in this thread (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=47378)<br />

We actually don't know if this is true or not. Or more specifically, there were 40 player guilds in vanilla because that's all we offered. Then there were 25 player guilds for BC because that's all we offered. We had a lot of data and feedback that there are a lot of players who would prefer to run with a smaller group of friends even if the content was very challenging. As I said, we will see if 10 player guilds are more casual or if there are a lot of 10 player guilds who are up to hardcore challenges.<br />
<br />
Im sorry but how the hell can BLizzard justify a &quot;hardmode&quot; in a game where a 25 man geard ppl can go and get gear EASIER than what the casuals have to face? WTF is going on....<br />
<br />
SKills ? .... Are you saying that ppl now in 25 man gear are more skilled than those in 10 man gear ? No ! They are not. So why are there higher stats on this gear? So that those ppl can go and do 10 man modes harder to get even better gear ? lol... Are 25 mans more skilled when they get the 10 man hardmodes done ? NO they are not. Still they get the items MORE easy than ANONE else in the game. What the FUCK is BLizzard talking about when they claim they can't give out PVP items in BS cause it does not represent skill ? Now WTH does 10 man hard mode items stand for if not ONLY easy to get items for 25 man raiders....<br />
<br />
And... this is just the beginning. Every person that has the BASIC understanding of RPG building can see where this is leading. The gap between gear for 10 and 25 man will grow and in the end it will be IMPOSSIBLE for 10 man raid to get those hardmodes done while the 25 mans are doing it half a sleep. <br />
<br />
Im sorry but this is where I say no thx BLizzard. Its a disgrace to watch this. Get your RPG rules CLEAR and FARE ! They are not atm. And you know it but simply dont CARE.</div></div><hr />

I hesitate to use the word whining, but most of what they said seemed to be complaints or criticisms, with the &quot;suggestions&quot; just sounding like the millions of others you see every day from armchair designers. Honestly I'm just not sure that there's really a niche for this kinda thing, it's not something that I can see myself looking forward to every week or fortnight or whatever.<br />

Still, the guys seemed likeable, and I watched the whole thing all the way through. If they shifted it to something much more specific and indepth and perhaps defined themselves a little more I'd probably find it more interesting.<br />

<br />
Which is utter stupidity, they seem to be closing the game down, instead of expanding it......<br />
<br />
<br />
How can you say they are closing the game down instead of expanding it when they are offering more content than ever? They haven't done away with 25 mans in anyway, they have only added additional 10 man content. Ulduar has more loot in it than all of TBC combined, clearly they are closing the game down. <br />
<br />
All the 25 man raiding guilds from TBC that loved 25 mans still have the option to do so. All of those who couldn't get 25 together to successfully raid, can now try 10 man raids. And there are even, GASP, some of us that were successful 25 man raiders and still know 25 skilled interested raiders now, but choose to do 10 man raids instead. I have the &quot;skill&quot; for 25 mans, I just got tired of waiting on late players to log-on, playing with kids, dragging along baddies, playing with people I didn't really know very well, etc.<br />

Doing 10-man content is a blast. The same 10 of us work together every single week. We know how to play well together, we know about each others personal lives, we don't have to deal with dkp or any loot drama because its always the same 10 and we trust each other. I could go on and on.<br />
<br />
I am now beating the same dead horse you are, but assuming that people don't really want to 10-man raid and that those who do only do it because we have no other choice (for whatever reason) is folly.<br />
<br />
Silly &quot;sky is falling&quot; players who feel that they understand the 11 million player base better than Blizzard and can run a better game.</div></div><hr />

We value your opinions and appreciate all of your feedback.<br />
<br />
OOMCast looked interesting but at the same time I have no idea who the three guys are, and several things they said just made me think that they don't really have an expert grasp on the game. Really it didn't seem to come down to anything constructive, simply more of the same stuff you see on the forums. I hesitate to use the word whining, but most of what they said seemed to be complaints or criticisms, with the &quot;suggestions&quot; just sounding like the millions of others you see every day from armchair designers. Honestly I'm just not sure that there's really a niche for this kinda thing, it's not something that I can see myself looking forward to every week or fortnight or whatever.<br />
<br />
Still, the guys seemed likeable, and I watched the whole thing all the way through. If they shifted it to something much more specific and indepth and perhaps defined themselves a little more I'd probably find it more interesting.<br />
<br />
Something different's always nice though, certainly not gonna be upset seeing new things on the front page.<br />
This is an extremely valuable insight that is a relatively large oversight on our part. We will put together a bio for each member of the team. Though some information about each of us is currently available in the about section of our website, we do agree that it is a bit inadequate.<br />

There is absolutely nothing to be displeased from the blue posts right now. Nothing.<br />
<br />
As far as the patch goes, why the hell do people always think &quot;it will come right before Noblegarden&quot;? WHY WOULD IT?<br />
<br />
I'd find the decision to release the patch right before it -stupid-. Why? The patch hits, an insane amount of new content is released, but oh no, a lot of people will have to concentrate on a World event instead.<br />
<br />
Releasing it a few weeks before makes much more sense. I'm still fishing for 7th, but 14th would make sense as well. 21th makes no sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Kalgan is behind all the changes&quot; HAHAHA... <br />

I think you misinterpret this, no one in Blizz's team have absolute decisions on anything. He is still a part of the decision making.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-04-05, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No one cares about arena. No one cared about arena in TBC either. The majority of the teams in TBC only played 10 games a week and the only reason they played was for easily obtainable gear (which has long been referred to as &quot;welfare epics&quot; but what is more welfare than joining a pug raid only to die in the first few seconds of every boss fight and still get gear from the boss). <br />
<br />
Now that the gear has moved on so has the players. All that is left is a bunch of players that care more about stroking their WoW epeen then behaving in a mature manner in game and for some reason those players flocked to DKs (probably because if you played one well it was overpowered but yet people play them and are happy to get 1300 dps). <br />
<br />
There is a vacuum left where arena and pvp used to be. Arena and BGs were popular because they were any easy way to get caught up with the next tier of raiding if you lagged behind a bit. Now, there is no easy way to do that. The result is that anyone that lags behind is going to be sitting out until the expansion comes. PvP/arena was FINE in TBC as the spot to get caught up to raid progression with items that didn't rely solely on the RNG. So were badges for that matter. <br />
<br />
In Wrath, if you missed Naxxaramas, the only way you will actually see Uludar is if the raid is so desperate for your class that they are willing to gear you and about the only class that still brings that much power is the shaman. In TBC, it was a lot easier to go spend a week pvping if you missed raiding drops because the items from PvP were actually worth going after. No one likes work without reward and the current pvp system isn't fun. PvP can be fun, just look at WG, but the BGs and the arena are all dominated with the most overpowered class and no one really enjoyed being yanked around by 2-3 different dks when you couldn't do anything to stop them till you were dead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I stopped watching there, what a bunch of idiots :|<br />
<br />
<br />
Idiotic as in true? Plate gear was loaded with stamina for both holy and dps. Its sad when the retribution paladin can easily get 27k unbuffed and still do decent dps with the right gear choices. Rather you like it or not, PvP is about survival, and having that much stamina on your gear greatly increases your chances of survival. However, leather gear has the same amount of stamina (other than casting gear) if not more so and the only ones truly getting screwed are the clothies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't believe the stats for the legendary mace are in the game yet (or just haven't been datamined) which probably means there are other changes coming to the ptr<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't believe so at all. They are ending arena on the 14th which means the patch is probably hitting on the 14th. You guys think that Noblegarden has to be part of this patch when it doesn't. The reason they are pushing back Noblegarden is because it wasn't going to be ready for this patch. They can patch it in 3.1.1 on the date they want it to start.</div></div><hr />

What game are you playing? Between cheep crafted items, easy heroics and PUGable 25 what more do you want? Free gear just because you bothered to level to 80? In TBC you afked in the BG and you had your gear at the end of the week which wasn't right, and I'm pretty happy they changed the arena rewards so you can no longer get 5/5 and weapons with 10 games a week. Itemization is way better than in vanilla, back then you either had to raid hard or even worse play 24/24 to get the honor ranks. <br />
<br />
<br />
Vanilla and TBC had lots of end game content, even at release. WoTLK has next to zero end game content other than 2-3 hours of raiding a week.<br />
<br />
O'rly? Let's see back then it was Ony and MC in the beginning? That's a lot of content to you? TBC had more raids at release which were unbalanced. The content now is easy and even the devs admit it but they can't change it and they don't want to. The only thing you can expect is raids getting harder and harder from now on. So please stop saying that broken mechanics from vanilla and TBC were awesome.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-04-05, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im pretty sure most people would raid in larger groups to be honest. - Guilds comprising of 10 primary raiders are constructed these days because you give them an easy way to see all content. You shouldnt be measuring against what people are actually doing because they will naturally do what you give them. You should be asking yourself, not what people are doing, but what people find FUN.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that more people actually enjoy raiding with 9 people they like instead of 24 people they don't. I think that game play wise, more people enjoy 10 man raids because it requires more of a commitment from the people actually raiding than do 24 man raids. I think the problem is that most people will go where the gear is, and I personally am not doing 10 man because I want 226 not 219. I don't like the concept of getting crap gear just because I could even though 10 man is much more fun for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why are you modelling your game around PUG's?I guarantee you Blizzard, if you make the game have an easy path people can take, then the people will turn their backs on this game and you will lose custom, and you wont be able to get the people back because they will be playing something else.<br />
<br />
<br />
The truth is that this game was always somewhat pug friendly rather you want to admit to it or not and that was for good reason. People don't want to be in a raiding guild just to see content. They want to be in guilds that they actually enjoy being in. Its few and far between that you find a good raiding guild that you will actually enjoy being in. It took me 4 years to find one. Now that I have found one I am enjoying the game much more, but our guild started out as a series of players that came together and pugged content late at night. It grew from that into one of the top raiding guilds on the server. There is nothing wrong with balancing content around pugs and guilds. Guilds are just pugs of people you know where everyone wears the same guild tag.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Guilds will ALWAYS stack in raids to create the strongest team possible (the clever guilds anyway). <br />
<br />
<br />
This is so true. I mean why bring that well geared (when you got them the gear) skilled holy paladin when you need a restoration shaman for another mana tide and heroism. What they meant by saying that they have the balance better is that they REMOVED the reason that guilds stacked in the first place. All buffs in this game can be brought by 5 players. After that 5 its open season. You could say that a good guild then stacks dps, but the majority of dps is on the same page now depending on gear and personal skill. You could say that they stack for healers but the majority of healers are on the same page with some being better at group healing and some being better at main target healing. You could say that they will stack for better tanking and in that case you are probably right. Blizzard is destroying druid and dk tanks so the average raid will probably stack paladin and warrior tanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you purposelly ignore the fact that many people have 2-3 level 80 alts who are kitted out in Ulduar ready gear that they can easily swap between? <br />
<br />
<br />
This game really is set up much more to be a main toon game than a co-op toon game. Trying to keep 2-3 characters geared for content is exhausting. Having your guild tell you which one of those characters you can bring at a certain time then treat you like the red headed step child that dared to bring an alt to their raid even though they asked you to is even worse. The time investment in a single character is more than enough for players to focus on them. Do people have multiple alts geared out to do Uludar now? Yes they do. Why? Because Naxx25 was so easy and the loot was so easy to get from there that the majority of people had everything they needed from there in the first 2 months. After that they had no real reason to play the game at all. They found a reason by playing alts and getting them geared. If Uludar holds focus for a longer time, like Blizzard has said that it will, then there is a much smaller chance that people will take all their alts through Uludar25 and be ready for 3.2.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A final note on this - PLAYERS WOULD RATHER WIPE 2-4 WEEKS AND THEN FEEL THE SATISFCATION OF A GOOD TEAM EFFORT TO KILL SOMETHING THAN CLEAR CONTENT IN ONE WEEK AND THEN FARM IT FOR MONTHS AFTERWARDS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Replace PLAYERS with YOU. You would rather wipe for 2-4 weeks to accomplish something. The AVERAGE player would rather walk into the boss do 2-4 attempts and get their gear at this point. They don't care that its hard or not they just want their gear. Once they get their gear they go play on their alts again. If people enjoy wiping for 3-4 weeks to get content down then please explain to me why only a few select guilds have downed 3 drakes on my server and the reason for that was that the other guilds couldn't get 25 people (although they had 35+ members) to actually log on for OS2d+ attempts. Its because people DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT WON'T GET THEM LOOT!!!!! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
/Agree. Without the challenging PATH to the bosses, the actual value and fun in killing the bosses would diminish.<br />
<br />
<br />
I couldn't disagree more. For a strong raiding guild trash is just a nuisance that they will destroy anyways. In a strong raiding guild trash has never really comprised much of a challenge. Blizzard has a different view of TK trash than I do. The only way that TK trash was harder than some of the bosses was if your raid sucked. If your raid sucked then you were not a hardcore raiding guild. Trash in Naxxaramas (that apparently exists for decoration and the occasional free epic) was done extremely well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The funny thing is that you are actually agreeing (at least it seems to me anyways) with the person you are arguing with. It seemed to me that this persons take was why even bother with 10 man when you are going to give 25 man scrubs better gear. Blizzard has brought up the idea of making 10 man and 25 man content reward the same gear and share a lock out period. I think that is an awesome idea. I think more people would go with 10 man raiding BY CHOICE if they didn't realize that doing so will just mean they get to have inferior gear for doing the same amount of effort (if not more so because realistically a lot of 10 man content was harder than 25 man content so far in this expansion).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-04-05, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cant see how you can possibly think that 10 mans have kept you busy for the last 5 months. Which must mean you are a new player if they have, and if thats true, then you dont really have a qualified opinion.<br />
<br />
And if you have played for the last 5 months and you have been kept busy with 10 man content, then you must be playing less than 2 hours a week.<br />
<br />
<br />
For starters, his opinion is just as valuable as yours rather he has played for 1 week, 5 months or 4 years. You don't get to dictate the value of his opinion. Some people play this game for enjoyment. Our guild still runs Naxx10 once a week for the undying achievement. We still run 10 man Malygos. We still run 10 man OS (working on 2d atm). Some people actually play this game for FUN (imagine that seeing its a game and all) instead of gear. <br />
<br />
Last night we downed Hydross with 6 people (it was quite fun seeing none of us remembered the strat and we thought we could brute strength it when it didn't work out so well). Then we did Doom Lord Kazzak with 6 people (which again was quite fun) followed by Mag follwed by Attunemen. The warlock on Attunement got a doom guard from a curse of doom and proceeded to pull all of Moroe's room and kill himself because he had a doom guard. It was more fun than I have had in this game in a VERY LONG TIME and no loot was to be had by anyone.<br />
<br />
And if thats true, if this game appeals to people who play less than 2 hours a week, then this is also a definite sign of the game closing down.<br />
<br />
You say theyve given the game more than ever before? Nah, i call bull on that statement.<br />
<br />
A successful MMO NEEDS major end game content to KEEP people playing.<br />
Vanilla and TBC had lots of end game content, even at release. WoTLK has next to zero end game content other than 2-3 hours of raiding a week.<br />
<br />
The games success was majorly based on raiding models of Vanilla and TBC. With a raiding model that we have in WotLK, numbers are declining.<br />
<br />
I see less and less and less people logging on during the day, whereas before there used to be alot (and i play on apparently one of the Worlds busiest servers).<br />
<br />
Encouraging smaller raids, little end game content, nothing else to do. Sorry, but just no. They need to give something special in Ulduar or people will simply not log on except for the people that play 2 hours a week.<br />
<br />
And if they are the only people playing, this game is dead.<br />

<br />
<br />
No, that is not at all what I was saying. I was saying that if you miss a tier of content in this expansion there is currently nothing to fill in those gaps like there was in TBC. That means when no one else is even talking about Naxx and Uludar is cleared you won't get raid spots because your gear is no where near the gear of the other members of the raid, you don't have any unique must have abilities that help you find a spot because of your class, and people don't even pug Naxx anymore. That means you will be sidelined until the next expansion because your gear sucks. That wasn't the case when you could craft your way to T5 and fill in the gaps with pvp gear in TBC.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Free gear just because you bothered to level to 80? In TBC you afked in the BG and you had your gear at the end of the week which wasn't right, and I'm pretty happy they changed the arena rewards so you can no longer get 5/5 and weapons with 10 games a week. Itemization is way better than in vanilla, back then you either had to raid hard or even worse play 24/24 to get the honor ranks. <br />
<br />
<br />
No one said that it was right. By the way, I never afked a single BG. I earned my BG gear through hard work and hours PLAYED. I played bgs much more than any raider ever plays for the gear that I got. Yes, the changes to arena have been so successful that even Blizzard realizes that less than 50% of players play arena now when 95% played arenas in TBC. I totally agree that these changes are welcomed as it is obvious by the fact that 45% of the player base STOPPED PLAYING ARENA. That is a sign of a problem not the sign of a solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So please stop saying that broken mechanics from vanilla and TBC were awesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are so right. I mean, hell, the fact that people actually played the game and spent time in the game instead of whining on the forums was the sign that those mechanics were so broken. /sarcasm<br />
<br />
I never said that they were awesome. I said they weren't as broken as now. You try being the person that buys this game 2 months after Uludar is out who makes it to level 80 only to find out no raiding guild (or pug for that matter) wants him/her to raid because they are under geared and the only way they can get better gear is to ride the RNG on Naxx25 gear in the occasional pug (I'm willing to bet it won't even be pugged once a week because the pugs will be focusing on Uludar too). What you don't seem to realize is that yes Naxx25 is easy and yes you can get gear from there but you still can't do it solo and the RNG destroys the ability to gear to get into higher content when you are newer and there is no solution to that problem currently in the game like there was in TBC.</div></div><hr />

I played warrior for as long as I can remember and I lost total faith in this class. Arms is not allowed to burst, not allowed to survive burst, and have to have a pally healer hold our hands around town. This is the most ridiculous blizzard game ever now. Those arena tournament statistics are very depressing when see your class completely off the map of the tournament in both US and Europe. Playing this latest expansion is extremely frustrating to see your main class get shelved in the closet and see your profession go to crap. Blacksmiths are being totally screwed over and over again. We got a BOE weapon that is equal to or less than heroic Colossal Axe. What was the point of suffering to become an armor smith or weapon smith if blizzard won't implement something to for the people who suffer for those specialty. We get two sockets and that is it. Two stupid sockets and that is all that blacksmiths get in the expansion. I am not counting the belt one because it is BOE and other people can get that socket too. Where are the exclusiveness of blacksmith. What is the point of wasting thousands of gold to level it and get two sockets. In conclusion please fix warriors and blacksmith profession. As for the up coming patch for arms warriors, those new moves and new dps looks like utter garbage. Why? More restrictions on Taste for Blood, giving a cool down on that move. This watered down version of the old overpowered is an insult from blizzard. GET NEW ART WORK for the equipment in expansion for the love of god. Every weapon and armor looks exactly the same and punish hackers and cheaters. Make it illegal to multi-box, which I already know your not because of the profit from having multiple accounts and such. Give warriors an identity. Every move blows compared to everyone else that can be a warrior or do what warriors can do. If you think about the warrior moves and skills, every class has our moves or better improvements. This is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

I was saying that if you miss a tier of content in this expansion there is currently nothing to fill in those gaps like there was in TBC. That means when no one else is even talking about Naxx and Uludar is cleared you won't get raid spots because your gear is no where near the gear of the other members of the raid, you don't have any unique must have abilities that help you find a spot because of your class, and people don't even pug Naxx anymore. That means you will be sidelined until the next expansion because your gear sucks. That wasn't the case when you could craft your way to T5 and fill in the gaps with pvp gear in TBC.<br />
<br />
There's currently nothing because there IS no tiers for there to be gaps in. <br />
There's BoE craftables coming in 3.1, there's BoE Ulduar drops, a new season of pvp gear (which always drops the prices/reqs of the previous season), as well as updating Vault of Epics with a new boss. <br />
There's certainly still pugs of Naxx/EoE/Sarth on my server - if anything, pugs have gone up in frequency because people have all gotten bored and leveled alts that need gearing while some guilds have stopped actively raiding altogether.<br />
<br />
BC crafting and pvp gearing were retarded. Blizzard seems to think so too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cant see how they even can be conserned about loot as on off spec man spec, allready in tbc around halfway trugh Black Temple we where on that subject and when Wotlk came we changed it slightley from only rolling main spec.<br />
<br />
since wotlk we never usedthe term off spec / main spec - we did set it up like if you are a warrior u can roll for a dps gear and tank gear ( since we do not need healing kits) for a pally, Druid they could roll for all 3 specs, and it has worked out werry well :) we are not the most harcore raid guild but i could go so far to call us semi hardcore with an 20th place on our server with only 3/4 days of 4 hours rading depending if we not have allready downed the content for the week regardless to mabey new trials.<br />
<br />
Mostley all in the gear got thir 2 or 3 kits with at least ilvl 200+ and up items and our trials even thoug they arent entitteled for a loot in 2 weeks of thir trial they still get almost a 2 - 5 epix pr run due to the rest of the more cored grp allready got thir desired items.<br />
<br />
Why did we do this allready before dual spec ? and before we even did know it would come ?<br />
simply because we found it more useable than trashing half of the loot to shards after a few runs,<br />
it does bennefit us better with a tank to roll to dps or a dps to a healer on the current raid day - insted of takeing eigter pugs or not going to raid cause we miss a player. <br />
<br />
a good tip for not having an off spec / main spec is still thoug to be kind enough to pass a desired item, lets say i want the tank axe from kel'thusad and a dps want it for offspec - this woul mostlikely be the part that would trouble up, we are just kind enough to say, well i could use it as &quot;my second spec&quot; but right now it bennefits you more so ill pass, and they simply mostley got it on next run, we do use dkp still for attending bosses and even with those loot terms we attend to have more dkp that we even can use on our 2 or 3 specs and nothing has been up in a big discussion about a loot term, cause in the end it can only bennefit to make us a stronger raid guild if people are sick, got irl life to take care of or what there else could come in our way for our ingame raids :)<br />
<br />
So iself do not see the problem they are trying to put out :) its just about thinking the best way for us all and not only ourself :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, that explains a lot. It's a classic case of Design by Committee. There might not be I-told-you-sos, but there's also no vision, no boldness, and no quick improvements. They really, really need to find someone smart with a strong vision to lead the team instead of sheltering behind a false sense of security from their consensus while the game is rotting around them.</div></div><hr />

WTF is going on....<br />
<br />
SKills ? .... Are you saying that ppl now in 25 man gear are more skilled than those in 10 man gear ? No ! They are not. So why are there higher stats on this gear? So that those ppl can go and do 10 man modes harder to get even better gear ? lol... Are 25 mans more skilled when they get the 10 man hardmodes done ? NO they are not. Still they get the items MORE easy than ANONE else in the game. What the FUCK is BLizzard talking about when they claim they can't give out PVP items in BS cause it does not represent skill ? Now WTH does 10 man hard mode items stand for if not ONLY easy to get items for 25 man raiders....<br />
<br />
And... this is just the beginning. Every person that has the BASIC understanding of RPG building can see where this is leading. The gap between gear for 10 and 25 man will grow and in the end it will be IMPOSSIBLE for 10 man raid to get those hardmodes done while the 25 mans are doing it half a sleep. <br />
<br />
Im sorry but this is where I say no thx BLizzard. Its a disgrace to watch this. Get your RPG rules CLEAR and FARE ! They are not atm. And you know it but simply dont CARE. <br />
<br />
<br />
Beyond the atrocious spelling/grammar, you're a moron. Go do 25 man raids on your own then, no one's stopping you.<br />
<br />
The point of 10 man hard modes is so the &quot;SKILLED&quot; players who are too bad to get a good 25 man guild going can flex their button mashing muscles and get gear comparable to the people who are in a real guild. Sorry, but 10 mans are easier by default than 25 mans, because you have less people you can't make the encounters as complicated.<br />
<br />
10 man hard modes are fine, no one's FORCING you do do them. Just do 10 man normal mode and then go do 25 man normal mode if you hate 10 man hard modes so much. It's about CHOICE, giving more OPTIONS to players that have 9 friends instead of 24, etc.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirjeize</div><div class="date">2009-04-07, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soooooooo.<br />
<br />
We get a choice to do the same instance multiple ways - <br />
<br />
10 Man Normal<br />
10 Man Hard<br />
<br />
25 Man Normal<br />
25 Man Hard<br />
<br />
Each instance has over 800 items of loot. (LoL)<br />
Each instance will be easy anyway.<br />
<br />
What an awesome way to spend time, i REEEEALLLLYYYY wanted to farm the same instance 4 different ways for months at a time *eyerolls*<br />
<br />
<br />
Now what WOULD of been a good idea is to have given us 4 new raid instances, rather than ONE instance with 4 different mode.<br />
<br />
One ot them could of b33n 10 man easy (lets say Naxxramus)<br />
One of them could of been 10 man hard (lets say a new &quot;Zulaman&quot;, maybe Zuldrakathon)<br />
One of them could of been 25 man easy (lets say Ulduar)<br />
One of them could of been 25 man hard (lets say Grim Batol)<br />
<br />
But nooooooo, thank god we got ONE instance that we can farm multiple ways over multiple months while we wait for the next instance. YAY FOR CHOICE !!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes we get a 10 and 25 manhard and easy mode. NO not each of them wil contain 800 items. The 800 items are added in the ENTIRE patch, wich includes the argent tourment, noblegarden etc. And besides that you realy want 4 new instances ? I'd like this one nailing everting on hard mode then see some more content later on. Altho it would be nice if everything was just &quot;hard mode&quot; so that the real raiders get a challenge again and not every dumbass is able to clear all content with facerolling pugs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RWeber</div><div class="date">2009-04-07, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im just asking the question, Why on EARTH did Blizzard decide to release one raid instance at a time with WoTLK.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because every dollar saved by not creating content is a dollar that goes directly to the bottom line of the company. It takes far more effort to create Kara/Gruul/Maggy/TK/SSC from scratch to launch TBC with than it takes to retune one old raid zone and create two new dragons.<br />
<br />
WoW is past its golden years, now it's just a cash cow that will be milked until Blizzard gets its next MMO out or a serious competitor appears.</div></div><hr />

For example, 3D 10 man was SO MUCH EASIER than 3D 25 man...<br />

Plate gear was loaded with stamina for both holy and dps. Its sad when the retribution paladin can easily get 27k unbuffed and still do decent dps with the right gear choices. Rather you like it or not, PvP is about survival, and having that much stamina on your gear greatly increases your chances of survival. However, leather gear has the same amount of stamina (other than casting gear) if not more so and the only ones truly getting screwed are the clothies.<br />
<br />
<br />
...are you serious? I have 23k unbuffed in full furious (apart from the sets, had to buy weapon first ^^)<br />
<br />
There is no combination of ret gear in the game that is going to net you 27k hp, not unless you fully gem stamina, in which case you'll be hitting like a wet towel..</div></div><hr />
