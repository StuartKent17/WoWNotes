MovePad in a future content patch<br />
I wanted to follow-up with a bit more input into this thread with some information that you may find helpful. Awhile back, UI developer Slouken had developed an addon called “MovePad” http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info5476-MovePad.html which would allow people to use the mouse to move around the world with. This is something we are planning to implement as an option in a future content patch. We would also like to encourage everyone to share any additional small script functions or changes that might help make better addons for disabled gamers so that we could look into the feasibility of adding these into the game as well. <br />

Garrosh Hellscream: Then and Now<br />
Fortified citadels lie in ruins. Once-verdant forests burn brightly in the twilight of the setting sun. And arid stretches of desert, known to have claimed even the hardiest of travelers, now house fertile oases.<br />
<br />
The breaking of Azeroth changed a great many things. While the altered landscapes of the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor may be the most noticeable evidence of Deathwing's violent return, many of Azeroth's heroes have also undergone drastic physical and mental transformations of their own.<br />
<br />
Some have questioned Thrall's decision to set Garrosh Hellscream into the fiery crucible of Horde leadership, but none can doubt that this Mag'har orc from Outland has charted a course for his people that will change the very face of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/april/garrosh_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/april/garrosh.jpg)<br />
<br />
As the son of the orc credited with his people's redemption, Garrosh Hellscream has always carried a bitter mantle of duty to his kind. Before learning of his father's ultimate actions against the Burning Legion, Garrosh had borne the shame of Grom Hellscream's corruption and feared that such weakness might be found within himself. When Thrall arrived in Nagrand and showed Garrosh the truth of his father's martyrdom, the Mag'har was transformed. Filled with a renewed sense of strength and confidence, he returned with the warchief to Azeroth to be his advisor. Soon named overlord of the Warsong offensive, Garrosh displayed a courage, tenacity, and hot-bloodedness that both impressed and worried other members of the Horde. These concerns were only heightened after his appointment as warchief, as Garrosh has paid little heed to opinions originating outside of his race.<br />
<br />
Hellscream's ascension has been applauded by most orcs, who feel that his brash warrior instincts and unwillingness to negotiate for needed resources are more in tune with the true orc way. While Garrosh appreciates public recognition, even relishes the acceptance amongst these green-skinned orcs, he has little time or patience for ostentatious displays of leadership. His attention is now focused on strengthening the walls of Orgrimmar and providing supplies vital to his people: food, lumber, and the other essentials for living, which are growing scarcer in the recent drought. If these can only be gained through the blood of selfish Alliance dogs, so be it.<br />
<br />
Already distrustful of the other branches of the Horde, Garrosh has learned that the various leaders of these factions are more powerful than he had originally estimated. The duel with (and eventual slaying of) High Chieftain Cairne Bloodhoof was costly, as it resulted in a civil war amongst the tauren. The exodus of the Darkspear trolls from Orgrimmar, led by a dissatisfied Vol'jin, has spread the Horde's once-concentrated military mighty thin. And Sylvanas Windrunner, the Dark Lady of the Forsaken, has not been reserved in sharing her low opinion of the new warchief. Garrosh is not one for diplomacy—with the Alliance or even among the members of the Horde—and he is only now realizing the price for this mindset. Whether he sets that at a higher value than his vision for an invigorated, purified Horde is yet to be seen. In the end, some feel that Garrosh Hellscream's ideals will bring about the salvation of the Horde, while others feel he will usher in its downfall.<br />
<br />
We'll be examining other key characters' transformations—including those of Anduin Wrynn and Magni Bronzebeard—in the months ahead, so come back soon.<br />

<br />
<br />
Same reason I would guess that they might want/need an option to play a female character. I would imagine they are only going to apply this change to the demon classes that may have a opposite gender (succubus/incubus and maybe the felguard and doomguard) since I think Voidwalkers or Infernals are genderless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Close but no cigar. Drawing is extremely hard and time consuming. Artists just need a way to make it more....more....interesting! <br />
<br />
<br />
On a more serious note thats partially true. For example, there are these two 3D figures for 3d modeling programs. Ones a male and ones a female. The female has far more addons, clothing, hair, outfits and etc. because a majority of the artists are males and males are just interested in making stuff for that model. There was a big article about all this in a magazine. Interesting read. But it IS evident that most men prefer to work on females in art just by going to a 3d modeling online virtual store and looking at how the female products out number the male products. Its prolly, more fun to conceptualize stuff/easier on the eyes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're really trying to sell him. Most horde (and alli probably) liked Thrall, and tossing a douche like Garrosh into leadership role was a hard sell, and they failed in that. Not to mention he was (partially) responsible for Cairne's death, probably the 2nd most beloved out of all faction leaders on either side, and you have one, giant, red douchebag leading the horde.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what exactly are they &quot;giving in&quot; on? Giving in implies they are losing something or going back on something. Seems to me they just thought it was a good idea.<br />
<br />
I think its pretty snazzy myself.<br />
<br />
My bet is we get a female imp, an incubus, and they grab one of the female demons from outland to replace the Fel Guard. No change in the voidwalker or felhound. Again, just a guess, but that hardly seems like a lot of work, TBH. What exactly is your point again? Blizzard can't release new models without somehow being bad?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Here's how I see it happening:<br />
<br />
Imp: no distinct change. Maybe a different color fire.<br />
voidwalker: probably no change at all.<br />
Succubus: Male satyr-ish looking thing.<br />
Fel Guard: Female blood mistress-looking thing (like the ones lurking in the caves beneath the respective faction settlements in Hellfire Penn.<br />
Fel hound: No change.<br />
<br />
Then again, maybe there is no MODEL change, maybe it'll mostly be a voice thing.</div></div><hr />

The warlock pet change is as simple as acquire 3-5 models, and code a switch to chose between what is available.<br />

Dance studio is find a way to shove many different animations into many different models, none of which were originally designed to work that way, then coding an interface to allow people to browse and choose from the new animations.<br />

yeah but you need devs to create the &quot;choose option&quot; so their time is wasted instead of using it on something useful like real BoA items or achievs sharing with all chars or even damn balance/broken mechanic they spend it on some useless demon pets... way to go blizz, way to go...</div></div><hr />

I think its pretty snazzy myself.<br />
<br />
My bet is we get a female imp, an incubus, and they grab one of the female demons from outland to replace the Fel Guard. No change in the voidwalker or felhound. Again, just a guess, but that hardly seems like a lot of work, TBH. What exactly is your point again? Blizzard can't release new models without somehow being bad?<br />
<br />
I'm not implying anything.... I was just saying that what is wrong with the original models for the Warlocks pets..... they all look awesome....(with the exception of the Voidwalker... thats just a model used over and over) they don't need to have more genders to the pet range.... that is why roleplay was created.

Look, if you ever have gone to the official forums or read any of those &quot;Ask the Devs&quot; you'd see that this is a highly requested addition. MANY people have begged for Incubi for years. Its about time they answered that wish. You may not want or understand why they're doing this, but its painfully obvious that this was regularly requested on the official forums and in every FAQ ever. So yeah. Its only natural they'd answer this request.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't play horde anymore, but as I understood things, by the end of some point (newb zone... level 20? hell I don't know, as I said, this is second hand knowledge to me) Vol'jin softens his attitude to Garrosh, and wishes him well. I could be fully mistaken, but I thought for sure I read about that back when the &quot;Garrosh sucks&quot; bit started.</div></div><hr />

As far as I'm concerned, I already have male and female trees, new model being male and the old &quot;granny&quot; tree being female.<br />
<br />
No matter how many curves you give them, a moonkin won't be hot. I'd rather a new glyph:<br />
<br />
Glyph of Persistent Form<br />
Druid<br />
Minor Glyph<br />
You retain your original shape when activating Moonkin Form, and the shape changing portion of your Tree of Life last for 3 minutes. All other functions of Tree of Life expire as normal (including polymorph immunity) Does not function in arenas or battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
That just about covers druid form complaints as I see it. Read a few posts up for what I feel about gendered bear/cat.</div></div><hr />

If they're lazy they MIGHT do that. Shiverra do have a Bladestorm animation. Or the art team might literally give us female Felguards, prolly would be similar to Valkyr (grounded) with similar helments, and the same skeleton.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easy solution:<br />
- leave existing models in-game and on the creation screen<br />
- add new high-res/revamped model options<br />
- give everyone a free character re-customization.<br />
<br />
They had a monthlong stress test on the beta where every hour, most of the characters for each account on the entire realm would receive re-customizations/race changes. Of course, they did this because they anticipated high demand for paid changes to Goblin/Worgen and the new class/race combinations, but still, the code for enabling free full-realm re-customizations not only exists, it's already been tested.<br />
<br />
This is one area where it would be extremely easy to satisfy everyone if they were so inclined (which they're not - WoW philosophy now = get the same amount of money for a fraction of the effort, but that's another discussion).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dariela</div><div class="date">2011-04-15, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easy solution:<br />
- leave existing models in-game and on the creation screen<br />
- add new high-res/revamped model options<br />
- give everyone a free character re-customization.<br />
<br />
They had a monthlong stress test on the beta where every hour, most of the characters for each account on the entire realm would receive re-customizations/race changes. Of course, they did this because they anticipated high demand for paid changes to Goblin/Worgen and the new class/race combinations, but still, the code for enabling free full-realm re-customizations not only exists, it's already been tested.<br />
<br />
This is one area where it would be extremely easy to satisfy everyone if they were so inclined (which they're not - WoW philosophy now = get the same amount of money for a fraction of the effort, but that's another discussion).<br />
<br />
<br />
In EQ we had it even better, we could chose to use the new models or not on a race/gender basis. It didn't make the new models any easier to stomach.<br />
<br />
The only plus was my Barbarian rogue's buttcheek was finally the right way up if I used the new models. I left the rest of them off.</div></div><hr />

I think Garrosh will indeed change over time. He has been trough alot.<br />
<br />
This, very much. Garrosh is young, younger than Thrall was when he probably took over the Horde, I'd wager. And some quests have shown that he's still easily spooked by things that happen beyond his control (ie, when Goblins give the SI:7 badge to him when they finish their starting area, the confrontation at the end of Stonetalon Mountains). <br />
<br />
He is bound for some hard, fast lessons that will make him realize that the Horde has to occasionally put outright war with the Alliance aside to face bigger problems and recognize internal issues within their own ranks sooner than later.</div></div><hr />

Basically, bigger game companies are usually divided into different sections focusing on different aspects of game development like PR, story/scenario, art design, programming etc.<br />
<br />
New models, areas or anything visual? That's being taken care of by the art design and 3D modeling sections.<br />
Fixing bugs and balancing things in the game? That's the programmer's jobs, which is usually based on feedback from players, which is handled by community represantives(blue posts, in this game, for instance).<br />
<br />
Honestly, the new demon models does sound kinda neat, but I'm with Velossa on this one since there's still no new dances or the dance studio which was advertised in WotLK.<br />
Not to mention the fact that we get two rehashed 5man dungeons in 4.1 not a new 5man and the Firelands raid as planned.<br />
If anything, Blizzard is stalling simply because they're unable to release the new content in time, which would make the chance for optional content to be releases even more slim.<br />
<br />
On a different note, I would describe the comparisons between the different Garrosh models as simply this:<br />
WotLK Garrosh: Durrr.<br />
Cataclysm Garrosh: DURRR!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like what? Putting handle bar tassels on your favorite mount? I'm certain that's far more important than something that's been requested for years and years, much akin to the new druid skins that came in 3.2 and got very similar whining to yours.<br />

You just haven't been looking hard enough. More customization for demons are asked for more often then new druid forms ever were.<br />

Most of the time, druids are asking for moonkin to be optional or to bring back full time ToL.</div></div><hr />

&quot;This is something we would dearly love to do. We agree that melee specs get to see their weapons a lot more often in combat while it's easy for casters to forget about them. It's definitely on the list, but understand that we have so many races now (and two sexes for all existing races) that the animations get expensive to produce.&quot;<br />

<br />
Do you realize we are talking about like 50-60 animations? You can't just write one animation and plug it into every model. The skeletons are different. That means we need an animation for each weapon type, for each race, and each gender of each race. Not to mention moonkins, trees, any any other model I might be forgetting.<br />
<br />
When you compare that to what will likely be a voidwalker reskin, and grabbing a few outland demon models, the bang-for-buck factor grossly favors new demons.<br />
<br />
Fancy cast animations? Please. Do they really matter? Are you watching your animations in a raid? Damn, maybe thats why the puggers suck so bad. Keep your eyes on the ball...</div></div><hr />

Even though someone with a bit more insight might have posted it: a female Succubus is called Incubus. And it's not &quot;lol&quot;, it's just not as far known due to us &quot;males&quot; being far more openly &quot;sexist&quot; than females are ;)<br />

Its actually very sad ... I mean seriously blizzard has HUNDREDS of employee's and when one group try and give players more customization options some DPS obsessed mad-man screams to stop wasting time on &quot;Trash&quot; and worry about their class. I'd take customization over class balance. :/ There are 3 trees and just because the tree YOU LIKE isn't as good as others doesn't mean it is unplayable, NOR does it mean all three trees have to work perfectly. Stop worrying about top of the charts and worry about what you enjoy. I haven't been able to do decent DPS in the BM tree since BC because they nerfed it into the dirt but its still playable so I still USE it.</div></div><hr />

Garrosh is young, younger than Thrall was when he probably took over the Horde, I'd wager. And some quests have shown that he's still easily spooked by things that happen beyond his control (ie, when Goblins give the SI:7 badge to him when they finish their starting area, the confrontation at the end of Stonetalon Mountains). <br />
<br />
He is bound for some hard, fast lessons that will make him realize that the Horde has to occasionally put outright war with the Alliance aside to face bigger problems and recognize internal issues within their own ranks sooner than later.<br />

lol Garrosh is older than Thrall, so he is way older than when Thrall became Warchief. Youth is not an excuse for incompetence.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I'm going to wait and see if this ever eventuates. I just hope they make it that you can select the gender of your demon - my warlock would want to keep her succubus.<br />

(Oh, and a male succubus is an incubus. Succubus means (roughly) &quot;that which lies below&quot;, Incubus means &quot;that which lies above&quot;. Very sexist, but ancient so I guess it's excusable.)</div></div><hr />

they've kind of shot themselves in the foot with this announcement, because they've now created an expectation that all the demons are getting reskinned, when realistically, only the succu, felguard, and imp even make sense.

Also, I'm a little baffled that Blizzard is giving us male and female lock minions. WTH would a girl imp look like? I would rather have other options in coloring than to pick their gender. Its just...weird.<br />

<br />
yeah I'm thinking so too, Thrall isnt going to be warchief again, he will probably spend the rest of his life trying to restore the planet. I wouldnt say its going to be getting the spirit of his father, but he will probably get a visit from Grom's spirit in a dream or something, or somebody from the past who remembers how Grom was will come to him and tell him hes a disgrace to the Hellscream name or something like that. Garrosh is always going to have this attitude of being a jerk, but a visit from someone in his past or his father's past will likely change his attitude towards the rest of the horde at least a little bit. Sorry to tell all you naysayers who think Garrosh is just temporarily sitting in for Thrall as warchief, he's not, Blizz already said on their website that the change of power is permanent now. If he doesnt change how he treats everyone else, the other factions of the horde are going to turn on him and then he will be fighting the entire alliance and more than half of the horde at the same time, which will definitely be bad news.<br />

Why does Sylvanas hate wearing pants?!<br />

<br />
The new verisons of warlock pets?! kinda surprising<br />
Incubus - would like to see something like a gimp suit or at least something with a mask that has full head coverage. LMAO at the bieber version<br />
Female Fel guard - that artwork in the post from Duniah looked pretty amazing also -<br />
female voidwalker - lol<br />
felhound -&gt; felbitch<br />
Infernal - ???:confused:<br />
imp - easy enough to do does this mean I get to chose the sex of my imp in a ball?<br />
<br />
Garrosh before &amp; after model - looks like he's got quite a burden on his shoulders literally &amp; figuratively<br />
<br />
Fan art - <br />
Deathwing - just when they are abt to fix those towers in front of SW he comes and messes it up again. time to put that scaffolding back up.<br />
Sylvanas - hot :D<br />
Jaina - Wondering if she'll ever see some Thrall action again<br />
Malfurion - nice work!</div></div><hr />

I'm rolling tank for 4.1 if any lock brings a incubus it's instant kick or if that won't work, I'll just sit down n won't pull until the lock leaves.<br />
<br />
This is BS Blizzard...just update the models, most players are not female so scrap the incubus n demon gender crap because most of us don't want this change!<br />
<br />
For voidwalker it should be easy, just update the voidwalker to the Burning Crusade model!<br />
