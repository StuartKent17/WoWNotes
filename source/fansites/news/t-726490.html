Reforging<br />
First, we looked at the recipes for Cataclysm professions and decided we had plenty of content already.<br />
<br />
Second, we were concerned about making players feel at all dependent on reforging for income. Reforging is an unusual feature because it's never going to make a best-in-slot item. If we linked it to crafting professions, players would then rightly expect to make some kind of profit off reforging and in turn we might feel pressured to prop it up into a bigger part of the game than we really think it should play.<br />
<br />
Third, the idea behind reforging is largely as a convenience feature to players. Forcing them to go to the AH or use trade chat or find a friend or roll an alt to get a specific item reforged would have added at least one more step to a process that is supposed to be pretty quick. Consider that you already have to enchant and gem most end-game pieces of armor. We didn't want reforging to over-complicate that process even more.

More Badges in 25-Man Cataclysm Raids<br />
We're still messing around with the numbers because we want a system that works not only at launch but once there are multiple raid tiers and perhaps weekly raid quests and the whole nine yards. A very general idea (meaning it could end up being different) is that a group that can clear a 25-player raid can earn all of their points that way, while a 10-player group may need to supplement that income with more Dungeon Finder runs. We also recognize that badges are attractive early in a tier but that they lose their luster once you've earned a few pieces, so they can't be the only incentive.

25/10 Man Raid Achievements<br />
Will there be a single achievement for killing a boss or will it be divided into 10/25 achievements? It'll really suck if it's the latter and you can't run both weekly.<br />
Single achievement. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />

25/10 Man Raid Drops<br />
I think this is one of those cases where it's not going to be possible to please everyone. Setting aside some of the folks in this thread who want to run both 10s and 25s every week to maximize reward potential, most players either prefer 10s and have no use for the 25s or want to run 25s and don't want to feel like they are being inefficient for doing so. In other words, half (I don't know if it's really half, but it makes the sentence easier to read) the community wants an incentive to run 10s and no incentive to run 25s and half the community wants the opposite. On the other hand, we feel like we need to offer both raid sizes in order to make raiding attractive to a broad swath of the community. As a result, I think it's likely that no matter what we do, proponents of each raid size will feel like we're not being fair enough to their side. It's going to be one of those hybrid vs. pure or PvE vs. PvP ongoing debates that never really get resolved because each party wants virtually the opposite of the other.

<br />
Maximum income (gear) per week and shared 10/25 raid ID<br />
We balance around the maximum income possible per week because we know plenty of players will strive to achieve the max per week. The solution in our minds then is to not design a model where you can raid the same content that much. ToC was particularly troublesome because it had four independent lockouts. Yuck. We went to two lockouts for Icecrown based on that experience and are now eager to go down to one. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
[...] Some of you guys are coming from the angle that players should take responsibility for not playing more than they want to. I agree with that of course, but I also think the game design should not be something that puts that kind of pressure on you. We don't want to make a game full of traps or temptations that you should have to resist. It's more fun, I think, if what the game asks of you is reasonable. Killing the same boss twice or four times (as in ToC) or an unlimited number of times (as in the &quot;no loot&quot; model) doesn't seem reasonable. Neither does having to play Alterac Valley hundreds of times in a weekend to get a prestigious PvP rank. Neither does having to grind for consumables for hours every week before raid night. All of those things are theoretically &quot;features&quot; that players could have shown some common sense and opted out of, but realistically they were just boneheaded design decisions that we needed to fix.

<br />
10-Man Difficulty<br />
Remember that in LK the 10s were specifically designed to be easier (with a couple of exceptions where we messed up) and many players ran them with the loot they earned from their 25s, further exacerbating the problem. Given the complexities of some encounters, realistically it's probably not possible for every single battle to be of exactly the same difficulty in both 10 and 25, but we have a lot of room to bring them closer together.

<br />
My GM, who when the news of the new raid design first popped up said we'd keep running 25's, has now changed to saying that it sounds like 10 mans will be the most efficient way to play and gear up and that if 25's aren't worth running that he will probably quit the game altogether which will in turn probably bring most of the guild to also quit.<br />

25man raids will die if there is no distinction between persons raiding 25man and 10man. Even if content is balanced, 25man is harder because you need to find 25man skilled players and solve organisational problems of completely different level.<br />
<br />
IMO fail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, let's look at some current content where they admit to messing up and see just how hard 10 vs. 25 can be.<br />
<br />
The first thing that comes to mind is unbound plague. In 10 man, unbound plague is amazingly difficult to control because 1 minute across 10 people requires nearly everyone to participate. In 25 man, this isn't the case, with many guilds opting to just let it bounce around in melee for over half its duration. By contrast on the same fight, malleable goo is much harder to deal with in 25 man as well as the two oozes each needing individual attackers. Putricide is the perfect example of a fight which is balanced for difficulty for both 10 and 25 man raids, short of the obvious DPS requirement differences that exist because of how raiding is supposed to work now.<br />
<br />
Let's look at blood queen. 10 vs. 25 may seem like 10 man is easier at first, and you're probably right. You have much more room to spread out across the room for the air phase splash damage, there is less a chanse at dropping the &quot;purple poop&quot; on other players and you only need to link 2 people. The air phases are two minutes apart instead of 1.5 minutes, allowing WotF, Lichborne, PvP trinkets, EMFH and fear wards to be used much more easily.<br />
<br />
So what could happen in 10 man to make it more difficult? Howabout 3 air phases instead of 2 in order to make biting more dangerous? What about still having 3 people link instead of two, causing more motion to be necessary? Two people with the &quot;purple poop&quot; to fill up that space that would otherwise be occupied by 25 people? An added ability? 10 man could just as easily have been upped in difficulty, and in a few cases without really adjusting the fight mechanics.<br />
<br />
But then you will say, 25 vs. 10... why do 25 at all? Well, the reward will be greater in some way, but not so much that you are theoretically &quot;obligated&quot; to do 25s over 10s. The feel will be much more epic. The encounters will be slightly different.<br />
<br />
And even if nobody does 25 mans anymore, can you really be upset about that? Can you really blame people for doing the size of content they want to do? And besides... if there are more people out there like you and I who want to do the 25 instead of the 10, you're damn well sure that we'll not only find the people to make it happen, but we'll have fun doing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There will not be greater rewards, Blizzard have stated that explicitly. Everything is (supposedly) the same: difficulty, bosses, instances, achievement, drops, drops per player, etc. etc. They said 25 mans might drop a few more badges, but it's irrelevant since the maximum badges per week will be capped and people who don't do 25 mans can still reach that cap - and it's not like people care about badges after the first month or so.<br />
<br />
The 10/25 system is already a bore, the slight change of encounters does not make 25 mans any more &quot;epic&quot; than 10 mans.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And even if nobody does 25 mans anymore, can you really be upset about that? Can you really blame people for doing the size of content they want to do? And besides... if there are more people out there like you and I who want to do the 25 instead of the 10, you're damn well sure that we'll not only find the people to make it happen, but we'll have fun doing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's some twisted logic, first you make 25 mans obsolete, observe that everyone does 10 mans and then conclude that it's because people want to do 10 mans instead of 25 mans. No, the reason everyone does 10 mans is because you made 25 mans obsolete, NOT because people want to do 10 mans. They could just as well make 10 mans obsolete by having them drop no useful gear, then observe that everyone does 25 mans instead and then say that obviously everyone wants to do 25 mans and not 10 mans.<br />
<br />
If the system goes live in its current state I'd expect the server top 25 man guild (or two) to do 25 man raids, but I suspect that most of the &quot;medium&quot; level 25 man guilds will change to 10 man guilds. Eventually even the few 25 man guilds will die out due to lack of recruits and lack of motivation. Furthermore, I suspect that since the number of competent raid leaders will not increase (will probably decrease) while the number of 10 man guilds will increase, there will be a huge churn of 10 man fail-guilds and raiding as a whole will get significantly worse for the average raider - as a response Blizzard will nerf all the content to the ground.<br />
<br />
I believe the system will be a mess and practically kill 25 man raiding from the game. It would be far better if Blizzard designed completely separate 10 and 25 man raids (e.g., Kara/ZA vs. SSC/TK). Blizzard has made many great 25 man fights and many great 10 man fights. They have not made a single fight that great in both 10 mand and 25 man mode.</div></div><hr />

The encounters will be slightly different.<br />
<br />
<br />
How will the rewards be greater without having anyone from 10 mans QQ? 2 extra badges isn't going to cut it and even then the 10 man people would go back to the &quot;we deserve the same things as everyone else give us our 2 badges&quot;. Fact is it will have to be more then just extra badges/honor or whatever they will be calling it, i have 652 frost badges rotting away as it is, having them rotting faster isn't a big incentive to raid 25's.<br />
<br />
Only reason people raid 25 is because of the bigger epeen for doing so, a top tier guild is not primarily about making friends (nobody in a 25 man guild loves everyone in the guild). The raid leader of a guild like paragon would Gkick his grandmother if she stood in too much sh*t. To them It's about killing stuff faster then anyone else, why wouldnt they just do it in 10 man if everything is equal?<br />
<br />
Will next expansion just be 10 mans? May as well take the &quot;MM&quot; out of &quot;MMORPG&quot; and just call it an Online Role Playing Game....lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to raid 25's, raid 25's. If the difficulty is the same, then there isn't going to be any incentive not to. There's no reason to break up your entire guild to run smaller dungeons.<br />
<br />
If raiding with a whole lot of people really was that bloody awesome, don't you think 25's would survive just on the virtue of more people?<br />

The truth is that raiding is flawed to the core - people seem to opt for having less people in the dungeon and every mob seems stupid as a rock despite being a celestial mathematical genius or something. (Hi Alcalon having an aggrotable)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I see it, if you like 25-mans, you do those; if you like 10-mans, you do those; if you like min/maxing, you do whatever is best for min/maxing, in the same since you will swap out guildies under the same reasoning.<br />
<br />
So, you THINK you might be forced to do 10-mans; again, but no one is forcing you, you're just doing it because that's how you like to play the game, you like to min/max.<br />
<br />
As mentioned in the post, if blizzard makes one of the 2 choices have more incentive, then BLIZZARD THEMSELVES will be forcing the choice on players.<br />
<br />
Blizzard wont be forcing you to go to 25-mans or 10-mans, the only thing forcing you is your own playstyle, or your mindset that is saying &quot;I must do what is the most optimal and efficient thing! That's why I like playing this game!&quot;.<br />

<br />
I heard that 1/10 players making a mistake has a larger impact on your raiding team than 1/25 players making the same mistake, because losing ~1/5th of your total DPS as opposed to ~1/15 is completely equivalent.

There, you just showed me what I was trying to tell you.<br />
<br />
YOU play this game for the thrill of figuring the most optimal thing out, and doing it!<br />
<br />
Get it?<br />
<br />
PS: I'm guessing you don't, so I'll just say this:<br />
<br />
Blizzard wants to player to decided what kind of raid they find fun, and let them do that, instead of telling them &quot;You need to raid 25-man else you're a scrub and can never get the best gear/titles and shall forever be called a noob!&quot;<br />
<br />
If you like 25-mans, you can raid that and not feel like you'll never have the prestige of 10-man raiders.<br />
<br />
If you like 10-mans, you can raid that and not feel like you'll never have the prestige of 25-man raiders.<br />
<br />
If you like min/maxing (like yourself), you can figure out what raids are easier on 10-man or 25-man, and play that raid!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The answer is the reason 25-man raiding is expected to die when the motivation of &quot;better gear&quot; is gone. Enjoyment only carries leaders so far before they realize it will be less than half as stressful with less than half the people.<br />
<br />
As I already said I prefer 25-man raids over 10-man raids because I enjoy them more. It's just more fun for me (leading or being part of). I hope I'll be able to find an entire guild that agrees with this but I honestly don't expect to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, you THINK you might be forced to do 10-mans; again, but no one is forcing you, you're just doing it because that's how you like to play the game, you like to min/max.<br />
<br />
<br />
They're not forcing anything. They're simply changing the model in a way that makes 25 man raiding undesirable when compared to 10 man raiding. The result will be that 25 mans will eventually die out.</div></div><hr />

Okay, one thing. Remember sarth? Yeah, was 10-man, or 25-man easier? Of the nightfall or Twilight Vanquisher? That easily shows a point where &quot;Hey, 10-mans might not be easier than 25-mans!&quot; This will most likely happen a lot more in Cata though, since they are actually trying to make 10s on par with 25.<br />
<br />
I'll say it again, and this will be the last time.<br />
<br />
You like to figure out the most optimal way to play, and play that way. You like finding out what gear is best; you like finding out optimal rotations and perfecting them; you like figuring out, and executing, efficiency; you have, by all means, the big-time achiever attitude.<br />
<br />
Not EVERYONE is like that though, so when you say &quot;10-mans are more optimal, so everyone will do those.&quot; Did you ever think that &quot;Hey, some 25-man fights MIGHT actually be easier like sarth.&quot; Or, &quot;Hey, maybe I like to just raid with a lot of other people!&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean, It's like saying Rated BGs are stupid because Arenas are more efficient due to you only needing 1 other person do do them with; plus, they're typically shorter in duration. But guess what, they are adding BGs back for competitive PvP because some people just LIKE playing with a lot of other people.<br />
<br />
It's not that hard to understand. :P</div></div><hr />

10-mans are easier to organize and run than 25-mans. If you had an infinite number of people playing World of Warcraft, all of whom wanted to raid, this would still be true.<br />
Why? Because 10 is a smaller number than 25.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kryss</div><div class="date">2010-06-16, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Retards that stand in random stuff, that's the problem. It's simpe math really. You got either 10 or 25 people for raiding. Try and find 25 good players, and try do the same for 10. Wonder what will go easier...<br />
<br />
It depends : <br />
<br />
- if your guild is already able to gather 25 skillfull players for raid and those like 25-man raids, I don't see what the Cataclysm changes will change… <br />
- if your guild has 10-12 really good players but wants to do 25-man raids for the loots/status/whatever and recruited less-than-average skilled players to complete its roster, then you have a problem. Cataclysm can help you resolve it (&quot;either improve or leave the top 10-man crew&quot;) <br />
- if your guild has 10 really good players and likes to run 10-man raids and push them to their best, it is currenlty stupid not to reward them with top notch stuff only because Blizzard wants you to be a 25-man guild…<br />
<br />
In the new system, the choice to do 10 or 25-man content belongs to the guildies. For guilds currently struggling to mantain 25-man teams throughout the week, the choice is either cancel raids, complete with pickup or recruit less than average skilled players to ensure 25 raidable players each raid day. The 25-man requirement for best gear limits a huge chunk of guilds by lowering their standards when recruiting or slowing their progression (raids cancelled or bad pickups).<br />
<br />
&quot;it is difficult to gather 25 skilled players so 25 man raids should be more rewarding&quot; is the proof that the current system is flawed. Why bother running 25-mans with bad players instead of 10-mans with a good players ? Only the loot. <br />
<br />
And what about beating hard content ? It has nothing to do in this kind of reasoning… True hard core raiders won't change their raid size to accomodate the new system unless 10-man or 25-man is really unbalanced for those min/maxing at all costs…</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not that hard to understand. :P<br />
<br />
Remember that Sarth 10 is on Blizz list of &quot;we messed up&quot;?<br />
<br />
When even Blizzard says that they won't be able to make 10 and 25 on par, but rewarding the same stuff (even achievements), then... even if you love 25 mans, you'll need to find 24 other players that love that too, that won't miss raids (since you can't resize 10 back to 25, if you do resize 25 to 10 because you don't have 25 online, you're in fact beeing forced to raid 10man that week instead of the 25 you love), etc... remember that most of the &quot;I play 25s&quot; players today run that because it's better rewarding than 10.<br />
<br />
If you give only one achievement for both, even the top 25man raid guilds would prefer to run smaller groups to acomplish the realm's 1sts, etc... you know that the other guilds racing against you for 1st kills will probably be running more efficient 10s instead of harder 25s for the feat of strenghts!<br />
<br />
In the end, R.I.P. 25 man raiding.<br />
<br />
One step closer to 5 man &quot;raiding&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure how this really helps to solve the problem. The people who want to do 25-man raiding now cannot do 25-man raiding. This appears to force them into 10-man raiding, or am I missing something here?</div></div><hr />

Therefore all guild will raid 10-mans!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, induction doesn't always work like that.<br />
<br />
I get what you are saying, it's easier to find 9 smart people than it is to find 24 smart people.<br />
<br />
But what I'm saying is not everyone plays this game to &quot;Be the best!&quot; or &quot;Catch um all!&quot; or just min/max. Some people just play the game the way they like to play, blizzard is simply trying to open the options a little, make it so you can raid in 10-mans or 25-mans without having huge disparities between them.<br />
<br />
You can still raid the way you want to. In all honestly, the top guilds will most likely stick with 25-mans by your logic, because they already have 25 elite raiders; they have no slackers, they have no stupid people; why would they ever switch to 10-man? I mean, if they start 25-man, and a boss ends up being easier on 10-man, they can always switch, right? They have choice that you wouldn't have, 10-man guilds may get stuck with some bitch ass fights that are tough on 10-man, you can't really say whether it will be easier right now.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Oh, and here is some food for thought. It may be easier to find 10 smart players, but unlike a 25-man, more responsibility will be placed upon those 10 players compared to 25-mans, where the distribution of responsibility can be further divided amongst people. In other words, you have MORE people that CAN pick up slack in 25-mans than 10-mans; you have more shoulders to lean on.<br />
<br />
What made sarth so hard is that you had less people in the 10-man to deal with the same amount of problems that were present in the 25-man, you had less shoulders that could keep you up. If blizzard is serious about throwing the same amount of problems at you in 10-mans as you get thrown in 25-mans, we will either be seeing some sarth-afided 10-mans, or some really dumbed down 25-mans.</div></div><hr />

You don't get what I'm saying. I said that I had an infinite number of people, although did I assume that they were all smart enough to raid. If they are all of the same intelligence 10 will, in almost every case, be easier to organize than 25. As previously stated, this is the reason that 25-man raiding is expected to die in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
<br />
But what I'm saying is not everyone plays this game to &quot;Be the best!&quot; or &quot;Catch um all!&quot; or just min/max. Some people just play the game the way they like to play, blizzard is simply trying to open the options a little, make it so you can raid in 10-mans or 25-mans without having huge disparities between them.<br />
<br />
You can still raid the way you want to. <br />
<br />
If, and only if, you can find enough people who enjoy 25-man raiding despite the additional organizational issues. As previously stated, this is the minority of the raiding player base now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, in all honestly, the top guilds will most likely stick with 25-mans by your logic, because they already have 25 elite raiders; they have no slackers, they have no stupid people; why would they ever switch to 10-man?<br />
Because eventually those players will, for a variety of reasons, be unable to continue raiding with their guild and there will be less players who want to join them (&quot;Why should I join a 25-man raiding guild? I can do everything I want on 10-mans.&quot;).<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and here is some food for thought. It may be easier to find 10 smart players, but unlike a 25-man, more responsibility will be placed upon those 10 players compared to 25-mans, where the distribution of responsibility can be further divided amongst people. In other words, you HAVE more people that CAN pick up slack in 25-mans than 10-mans; you have more shoulders to lean on.<br />
With the current system this is true. However, the system is changing in Cataclysm...<br />
<br />
<br />
What made sarth so hard is that you had less people to deal with the same amount of problems, less shoulders that could keep you up. If blizzard is serious about throwing the same amount of problems at you in 10-mans as you get thrown in 25-mans, we will either be seeing some sarth-afided 10-mans, or some really dumbed down 25-mans.<br />
I was under the impression that what made Sarth so hard on 10-man was that the damage was mis-tuned.<br />

Fun is subjective amongst people. Like I said before, some people like to min/max, others just like to play with a small group of friends, and some like playing with a bunch of people.<br />
<br />
You seem to be pushing people into extremes, as if someone who likes to be competitive, has to be a full on min/maxer. To be honest though, I'm guessing most people are a mix. They like to butt heads at times, but they're not necessarily going to be doing every minor thing they can do to maximize there efficiency, because in the end, they like playing to game to relax a bit.<br />
<br />
These are people who would like this change. They aren't going to get all angry about the 10-man version of this boss being slightly easier then the 25-man version, and vice versa; but they still want to be somewhat competitive on their server.<br />
<br />
Just remember though, there isn't much you can say right now that can prove that 10-mans will be easier than 25-mans. We literally have no idea what the differences are going to be between the two modes.<br />
<br />
All I can say is that you should expect there to be pushover fights for both 10 and 25-man; sometimes having the extra players in a 25-man for additional slows could help you with one bosses adds, or the additional tank in a 25 might help with that extra add that you might not have an effective way of dealing with in 10-man. Really, we have no one of telling right now.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
@TobiasX: Most of what you are saying is based off of the assumption that every player is against raiding a 25-man, and that 10-mans WILL be easier come cataclysm; both which can't be proved. And as for the &quot;Food for thought&quot; response, that's what I'm saying here, things will change, it's hard to prove either one of us is right, I'm just trying to show people things by saying the opposite of &quot;25-man is doomed!&quot;, because we really have no one of knowing if it is, do we?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the system goes live in its current state I'd expect the server top 25 man guild (or two) to do 25 man raids, but I suspect that most of the &quot;medium&quot; level 25 man guilds will change to 10 man guilds. Eventually even the few 25 man guilds will die out due to lack of recruits and lack of motivation. Furthermore, I suspect that since the number of competent raid leaders will not increase (will probably decrease) while the number of 10 man guilds will increase, there will be a huge churn of 10 man fail-guilds and raiding as a whole will get significantly worse for the average raider - as a response Blizzard will nerf all the content to the ground.<br />
<br />
I believe the system will be a mess and practically kill 25 man raiding from the game. It would be far better if Blizzard designed completely separate 10 and 25 man raids (e.g., Kara/ZA vs. SSC/TK). Blizzard has made many great 25 man fights and many great 10 man fights. They have not made a single fight that great in both 10 mand and 25 man mode.<br />
<br />
And of course you know all of this because you built your own MMO and this happened. No wait you're a psychic? No wait...<br />
<br />
Why does every viable raiding guild have to be 25man for WoW to be considered success? We heard this same bs right before BC.<br />
<br />
People that like 25mans will still do 25mans. And those that want a similar experience with same loot drops will do 10's because they're tired of sitting in 25mans that have 10 competent players.</div></div><hr />

10 mans don't get the same bonuses as 25 mans, thats what they seem to think is wrong. The government should put Blizzard in charge maybe they can balance the world and make it an equal place for all...lol<br />

I don't know if Blizzard lives in Disneyland or something but life isn't fair, most people struggle and live through it anyway and the rest kill themselves.

How did the game go from 0 to 10+ million players when it was hard to even get into a raid and now it needs to be so easy that everyone can do it with almost no effort at all?<br />

<br />
Currently, I have some friends I've been wanting to play with.<br />
<br />
Most of them just like to play with our small group of friends, and a 10-man would fit perfectly for that. Sadly, some of them hate the fact that 10-mans are basically loot-giveaways; you can't really raid 10-mans seriously, you miss out on plenty of things, including the tougher content that my friends want to compete with against others.<br />
<br />
There, Cataclysm just made me much happier due to this change, and it's nice seeing them look forward to it.<br />
<br />
Now, what's wrong with cataclysms system in your eyes? It's seems that people are viewing the &quot;death&quot; of 25-mans as a &quot;bad thing&quot;. I'm wondering why.<br />
<br />
I can only really speculate that it's because deep down, they like 25-man raiding, but are still willing to sacrifice what they like (specing the optimal spec for their class, even if they don't like it, for instance) to get ahead of everyone. In the end, they feel bad about the change, and therefore despise it for &quot;forcing them&quot; to raid in a way they don't want to.<br />
<br />
When in reality, blizzard is trying to allow for both 10-man and 25-man raids to coincide with each other. The &quot;forcing them&quot; part, is just their &quot;worse case scenario&quot; being played out of what &quot;might&quot; happen.<br />
<br />
Feels like a glass is half empty situation to me. :) Not to mention they are filling in a lot of missing gaps with their own preconceptions, which will only make things worse if you are seeing Cataclysm in a pessimistic view.</div></div><hr />

No.<br />
<br />
both which can't be proved. And as for the &quot;Food for thought&quot; response, that's what I'm saying here, things will change, it's hard to prove either one of us is right, I'm just trying to show people things by saying the opposite of &quot;25-man is doomed!&quot;, because we really have no one of knowing if it is, do we?<br />
Again, you've misunderstood what I've said. 25-man raids are easier to organize and run than 10-man raids for 1 simple, undeniable fact: There are less people to organize and keep track of. The part you seem to always miss is &quot;keep track of&quot; and this is not going to change in Cataclysm. Keeping 24 players organized, motivated and &quot;on the ball&quot; is more difficult as keeping 9 players organized, motivated and &quot;on the ball&quot; because there are more people present in the raid. There will be less people prepared to lead 25-man raids when they can get exactly the same reward with less than half the stress if they only go with 9 rather than 24 other people.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with 10-man raiders having access to the same stuff as 25-man raiders, but I prefer 25-man raids and would like to continue doing them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, I get it.<br />
<br />
But that's not so much a blizzard issue, as it is a issue with the guild, is it not?<br />
<br />
If most of your guild is cool with just saying &quot;No one can ever show up, let's just do 10-mans.&quot; Then that's of course what's going to happen.<br />
<br />
The 25-mans are there for people who like to a 25-man, if people aren't willing to show up for 25-mans, they obviously don't want to do 25-mans.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is now giving players the choice to raid with 9 other people, or 24 other people; if all of those 9 or 24 people aren't on board and pumped for raids, it's not going to happen.<br />
<br />
Heck, last raid night we were missing about half of the raid because no one cares for ICC anymore. Even if it was only a 10 person guild, if only half of the raid cares (5 people), we still aren't going.<br />
<br />
25-man guilds will have the upper-hand here, because if only half of the raid comes, you can still go via 10-man, where is the lose here? I only see win for both 25-man and 10-man groups. 25-mans have a viable fallback plan if people don't show, and 10-man guilds can raid competitively.<br />
<br />
This kind of organization has nothing to do with which (10-man or 25-man) will be more difficult, which is what the min/maxing, or efficiency is about. Nor does this show that 25-mans will be less viable than 10-mans, it's all on your guilds preference. Note how I say guild, yes, everyone needs to be wanting to same thing (10 or 25-man) or it's not going to happen; a house divided anyone?<br />
<br />
As a last added note: If you real feel that passionate about raiding in a 25-man guild, you should most likely try and find one that is staying as a 25-man guild. If you would rather min/max, you will have to wait and find out whether the 10-man or 25-man version of the raid will be easier.<br />

The problem is, I quote: &quot;Single achievement&quot;. It won't be possible to tell if some guild did 10 or 25man. Some people would raid 25man just to show others that they are good and that it's possible to kill sth on 25. But now noone will even notice. And this is fail.</div></div><hr />

First, we looked at the recipes for Cataclysm professions and decided we had plenty of content already.<br />
<br />
Third, the idea behind reforging is largely as a convenience feature to players. Forcing them to go to the AH or use trade chat or find a friend or roll an alt to get a specific item reforged would have added at least one more step to a process that is supposed to be pretty quick. Consider that you already have to enchant and gem most end-game pieces of armor. We didn't want reforging to over-complicate that process even more. 1. Yeah, because more content would be bad, eh? Wtf are they thinking?<br />
<br />
2. Well, nobody wants players to have to collaborate. After all, this isn´t an MMO...oh, wait.<br />

Because this is an MMO. MASSIVE MULTIPLAYER. Why stop at 10 players? Shouldn´t 5 friends be able to experience the same? Or three? Or two? Or everyone on his own? At some point you have to look at what this game is designed for. It used to be four playing together with others. But since 2 years it becomes more and more of a singleplayer game. Dalaran isn´t much more than a lobby to find other random and faceless people via the LFG-tool.</div></div><hr />

I think this is one of those cases where it's not going to be possible to please everyone. Setting aside some of the folks in this thread who want to run both 10s and 25s every week to maximize reward potential, most players either prefer 10s and have no use for the 25s or want to run 25s and don't want to feel like they are being inefficient for doing so. In other words, half (I don't know if it's really half, but it makes the sentence easier to read) the community wants an incentive to run 10s and no incentive to run 25s and half the community wants the opposite. On the other hand, we feel like we need to offer both raid sizes in order to make raiding attractive to a broad swath of the community. As a result, I think it's likely that no matter what we do, proponents of each raid size will feel like we're not being fair enough to their side. It's going to be one of those hybrid vs. pure or PvE vs. PvP ongoing debates that never really get resolved because each party wants virtually the opposite of the other. (Source)<br />
<br />

I thought I did but you seem to have lost your way...<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard is now giving players the choice to raid with 9 other people, or 24 other people; if all of those 9 or 24 people aren't on board and pumped for raids, it's not going to happen.<br />
The choice is there already with existing system is it not?<br />
<br />
<br />
...some of them hate the fact that 10-mans are basically loot-giveaways; you can't really raid 10-mans seriously, you miss out on plenty of things, including the tougher content that my friends want to compete with against others.<br />
Well, I'll go out on a limb here and assume your group is running with a lot of gear from 25mans? The option is there for your group to be strict 10man to provide the extra challenge if that is how you want to play. Why did you not take it?<br />
Is it not then a little nieve to think people wont take the easier (to organise) option and go 10man over 25man. Enough people do this and it removes the option from those left over to go 25man.<br />
<br />
I myself was initially all for these changes but I tend to flip-flop between for and against now. Regardless my options are being reduced not increased with these changes, and the biggest concern is that by the time it can be determined *if* this was a bad change it would be to late to reverse it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc71ba9fbd24</div><div class="date">2010-06-16, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is BS. Excuse for being lazy. Let the 10s lovers get 10s drops, and 25s lovers get 25s drops, how hard is that? Does blizzard want their entry-level employee paid with manager-level salary?<br />
<br />
To use your employees analogy: There would be 2 companies, one with a workforce of 10 and another with a workforce of 25. Are you saying that all 25 of the latter company should be paid the manager-level salary because the Manager of that company manages a company of 15 more people (more than likely with help from 1 or 2 additional people)?<br />
<br />
Sure, in the real world the manager of the 25 man company will likely be paid more than the manager of the 10 man company, but the &quot;grunts&quot; will be paid about the same, regardless of how large the company is.<br />
<br />
To move back to the actual issue at hand, all Blizzard is doing here is offering a choice for you to decide which route you would prefer to take, 10 or 25 man raiding. At the moment, people have to be in 25 man raids if they want access to the best gear but with this change it all now comes down to personal preference. If you prefer 25 man raiding then stick with it! From the sound of this discussion it looks to me like there will still be plenty of people willing to do 25 man raids because that is what they prefer to do.</div></div><hr />

Wow, more people to manage, no way, go with 9.<br />
Wow, pay attention to where you are (hi Lanathel air phase), no way, go with 9 and spread for the whole room.<br />
Wow, more bomb abilities like Sindra's Ice Tomb, no way, go with 9 and deal with only two tombs.<br />
Now Blizzard can say, we balance 10 and 25 man to be the same difficult, but that's just a lie. Those two points i made above are good points because 10 is easier to organize.<br />
It's the same for the ICC Buff, you have the option to disable it, but your guild would?<br />
And with the choice over 10 and 25 man, most people will choose the easier path, and nothing will tell if you are a 25man raider or 10man raider. Same titles, same achievements, same rewards (gear and probably mounts).<br />

Try healing for once in 10 or 25s. I did both and can tell you, you have alot more flexibility and margin for error in 25 the in 10s. It's freakin' frustrating the amount of stress you get in 10man (not even counting the extra combat resses and soulstones in 25s).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blatant support of 25-man over 10-mans. There is no reason to think 10-mans will be entry-level employees where as 25-mans are manager-level.<br />
<br />
Though, I will agree with Rryn on separate achievements, because no matter how close blizzard balances them, some bosses will just be easier in one over the other, and having separate achievements would be good shows of who beat the boss in the harder version.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why is it a bad thing? Because this is an MMO. MASSIVE MULTIPLAYER. Why stop at 10 players? Shouldn´t 5 friends be able to experience the same? Or three? Or two? Or everyone on his own?

<br />
They aren't taking away 25-mans, they are just giving the choice for you to do either 25 or 10. If your guild is having trouble getting people together for a 25-man, then you should most likely have a meeting on what everyone is willing to do come cataclysm. If people aren't willing to group up for 25-man (or don't have any urge to do so), and are fine settling with a couple 10-mans, that's something your guild needs to figure out.<br />
<br />
<br />
The whole &quot;in 25man raids the individual players can slack more than in 10man raids&quot; is just plain BS, there just is no room for slacking for anyone when you are working on 25man hardmodes such as Mimiron, Yogg+0, Freya+3, Algalon or LK, Putri, Sindra, Deathwhisper (Especially without any massive zone-wide buff). <br />
And just one player death can really make the difference between a kill and a wipe, really.<br />
<br />
Technically, it's true though. Each dps in a 10-man contributes 15% to 20% of the total damage in the raid. Each dps in a 25-man contributes 6% to 6.5% of the total damage in the raid. Beyond numbers, in 25-mans, you have more snares/stuns that can be utilized, more healers and dps'ers that can be divided more easily.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that 25-mans are going to be slack-fests, but as I said before, IF blizzard is truly planning on bringing 10-mans up to 25-man standard, you are going to see many more sarth issues appearing, where you don't have enough tanks to deal with adds, or you don't have enough utility such as snares and stuns to deal with things like LK valks, or as many CDs that could be chained on tanks, etc.<br />
<br />
These are things that in a 25-man raid, you wouldn't have to worry about as much; but in 10-man, becomes a much more obvious issue, and the one thing that I think blizzard would be able to work with to make 10-mans on par with 25-mans to make up for the lack of coordination required in 10-mans.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I'll go out on a limb here and assume your group is running with a lot of gear from 25mans? The option is there for your group to be strict 10man to provide the extra challenge if that is how you want to play. Why did you not take it?<br />
Is it not then a little nieve to think people wont take the easier (to organise) option and go 10man over 25man. Enough people do this and it removes the option from those left over to go 25man.<br />
<br />
Again, we have no clue if the easier coordination required in 10-mans will actually make them easy. We have no content to test that assumption on, remember.<br />
<br />
It's like having a stick, but missing an object to poke with that stick. We don't know what the stick will do to an object if it were to poke it, since we have no object.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why does every viable raiding guild have to be 25man for WoW to be considered success? We heard this same bs right before BC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do you ask questions that are in no way related to what I wrote?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
People that like 25mans will still do 25mans. And those that want a similar experience with same loot drops will do 10's because they're tired of sitting in 25mans that have 10 competent players.<br />
<br />
People don't pick raids based on the number of people they want in the raid. There is a million things that go into that decision such as what rewards it offers and how much organizational work is required. All things considered to me it seems 25 man raiding is becoming obsolete in Cata.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, im not a level 1 guy playing a female toon on an RP server who dances on the mailbox with nothing on to try and get penis pictures from 15yr olds.<br />

I always played to get in the highest instances and kill the hardest bosses before most people and get the best items possible so i could get to the next instance and kill the next hardest bosses before most people.<br />

But you are talking about how 10-mans are great super uber... And how is super that noone force you anywhere. But are you now forced to do 25-man? Only you force yourself. Becouse you want it.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micutu</div><div class="date">2010-06-16, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All this &quot;different options&quot; approach will only lead to &quot;easier path&quot;. Let's see: 10man vs 25man<br />
Wow, more people to manage, no way, go with 9.<br />
Wow, pay attention to where you are (hi Lanathel air phase), no way, go with 9 and spread for the whole room.<br />
Wow, more bomb abilities like Sindra's Ice Tomb, no way, go with 9 and deal with only two tombs.<br />
Now Blizzard can say, we balance 10 and 25 man to be the same difficult, but that's just a lie. Those two points i made above are good points because 10 is easier to organize.<br />
It's the same for the ICC Buff, you have the option to disable it, but your guild would?<br />
And with the choice over 10 and 25 man, most people will choose the easier path, and nothing will tell if you are a 25man raider or 10man raider. Same titles, same achievements, same rewards (gear and probably mounts).<br />
I just hope i find a pretty hardcore 25man guild if my guild and friends decide to go 10man.... the horror...<br />
<br />
All the examples above can be solved easy for balancing in more then one way. I can give you one right now: increase the range of the ability for 10man so people have to spread out more and calculate number of tombs / player based on 10 / 25s. <br />
The only advantage of 10s is the easier to manage and easier to resolve conflicts (loot wise and stuff), but 25s give you more flexibility and possibility for recovery in case of bad stuff. If difficulty is the same, would it matter if you're 10s or 25s ? Probably minimal difference in tactics and from most perspectives the same shit you have to do just with more people around.<br />
<br />
And the &quot;path&quot; or whatever many will call won't be 10s vs 25s , it will be 1st boss easier on 25s, second on 10s , third on 10s, fourth on 25s etc. and the difference will be minor and probably more visible at more &quot;hard&quot; levels and to perfectionist guilds made up by professional gamers (or very skilled ones).</div></div><hr />

Micutu does a good job of showing what I was trying to before about making 10-mans up to 25-man level. People are looking at it on too much of a straight-forward &quot;black and white&quot; situation. &quot;10-man will be more efficient on every fight due to easier organization&quot;. Where someone gets this assumption, I'm not really sure, since blizzard can do whatever they want between 10 and 25-man modes to even out the fights difficulty; and there is a lot more they can do that just change a couple health pools or mob spawn quantities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TL;DR: nurture players to become good instead of leaving them to do literally whatever they want with their character including gemming agility as a paladin, and be careful with numbing down content without giving players real motivation to actively improve upon their characters in both leveling and raid environment.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't believe people are bad or good by nature in a game. It's the way the game teaches them that will either make good or bad players. Right now you do need a lot of external sources to even come close to the maximum potential your character has. And not just stats - then there's fight mechanics and learning to be effective in fights, including CC, kiting, lifetapping, interrupting, stuff like that.<br />
<br />
I'm on a very lowpopulated, dying realm so the amount of people, recruits and even guilds are on a minimum. I don't have time any longer for hardcore 7/7 raiding so I joined a guild that raids 4 days a week - one of the 2 active 25man guilds on our server. I have in the past raided hardcore and spent weeks if not months progressing on single encounters. However, what I notice amongst our new recruits is that the vast majority of the people we get are average skilled, are unsure how to improve, but moreover, have no idea what progress means. When we hit Lich King with a lot of new people, I noticed how many just didn't understand or realize that spending weeks if not months on an encounter like this was exactly why a progress guild exists, because it's fun. I never had such a difficult time keeping the raid going and motivated. After one night of progress (and really good progress if you ask me, considering it was LK), people were completely depressed and never thought we could ever kill it. After two wipes people were already saying it was a lost cause. Why would we be able to kill it in a week, or in a month, if the first night went so terrible? People didn't realize that skill comes after practice.<br />
<br />
What I mean to say is that a lot of players I have encountered really have no idea what raiding is all about anymore. They haven't been challenged in forever. They're used to facerolling bosses where it really doesn't matter if you gemmed spellpower or gemmed strength as a elemental shaman - doing it right is just bonus. It doesn't matter if you die of fire either because whether you live or die really isn't crucial to most encounters. Players are made to be soft and not motivated to put more effort than needed in their toon simply because the encounters don't require you to. For example, most hunters we trialed didn't know how to kite, even though 'hunter' once used to be as good as synonym to 'kiting'. Even skills like that - kiting, CC, when to AoE appropriately - are no longer nurtured in players because the content is not challenging at all and that is how, in my theory, they end up to be mediocre players that could do so much better. The leveling experience is too rapid and not demanding. Learning to pull carefully in instances is no longer needed. Most mages stare at you blankly when you ask for a sheeppull. You don't notice most elites are elites until they're dead and you wonder why they took a bit longer to die. When you finally reach endgame, the encounters offered in both 5s and raids, simply are not demanding enough for players to wonder &quot;why do I have such difficulties doing X? Maybe I should..&quot;. I know there are some exceptions where fights really are tough (Sarth3D, LK, Sindra is another fight I know a lot of casual guilds are stuck on), but in general I think it is safe to say that the current state of WoW is that it's a complete pushover even for 'casuals'.<br />
<br />
And what's really offending is that Blizzard seems to think &quot;casuals&quot;, or players who aren't exceptionally skillful (the players you'll see in most 25 man pugs), need to be helped even more. This has become apparent in the development of WOTLK and now the announcement for changes in Cataclysm. In my opinion however, it is exactly this excessive numbing down of difficulty that makes a player a bad player. What a game that wants to be good really does is find a balance between making it not too hard, so most players can at least attempt the content, but all the while keeping enough challanges so players can keep developing and learn something new every time they enter a new instance or quest. This in my opinion is the essence of a game, of any game. Make it too easy, and people faceroll it and that's the end of it. Make it balanced, and people can have a chance at killing stuff but also a likely chance to fail, and as such be given opportunities to learn the class and the game mechanics more and more. The latter isn't possible or even needed if you're twohitting everything.<br />
<br />
On my very first toon, a mage, I literally saw myself develop after every quest and instance I did. I wasn't a good player by any means because WoW was the first real time RPG I attempted, and made mistakes in every area, including keyboardturning, clicking, not chaincasting, but gradually I learned and developed that my methods were clearly not the best because the content I did while leveling really motivated and even forced me to do better. I certainly did not feel raped by Blizzard even if a Gnomeregan run took 3 hours because it was long, difficult and very wipealicious; I felt challenged and excited and tried to overcome problems, either by asking help or just trying different things. Nowadays, this challenge seems completely cut in both regular world mobs/quest and instances or even raids. Gnomeregan was never so easy as it is now. Nobody even remotely cares about alarm bots, if they are even aware of what they do - doesn't matter, it's more experience anyway. Yesterday, I had a random BRD and we actually went to Emperor and ! killed it with ! 0 wipes, not a single one, in a 2 hour long run with toons that were arguably of too low level. We AoE'd everything with two enh shamans, a ret, a protadin and a priest. Not long after TBC's release, I remember taking 5 hours for that same run with wipes and long and difficult (sheep)pulls. It was the most amazing run I ever had. I have so many screenshots, it was absolutely epic and cool, educative, and just really awesome because of those challenges (though yes, it definitely was too long).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess i'm just among the people that do something to try and win and people like me believe that 10 mans will be the easiest way to win (AKA.get server firsts and get as high as you can in the US and world)<br />
<br />
There aren't any server first titles for 10 mans at the moment because everyone knows 25 is whats harder. 25 mans will always be harder, you have 25 people who can screw up by stepping in something and blowing up the raid instead of only 10.<br />
<br />
Nobody is forcing anybody to do anything as it is, if people feel like they need to do 25 mans to be better then they will also feel like they have to do 10 mans come cata.<br />
<br />
Without separate achievements for 10 and 25 mans, with the same drops whats the point?<br />
At least leave separate achievements and heck if accomplishing something in 25 man rewards you a mount then sure give the 10's man the same mount but change the color or whatever like they did for the Ulduar drakes, at least make something different. <br />
<br />
I feel like blizzard are creating their own problems now by trying to balance everything out for everyone. When i started playing 4yrs ago i wasn't able to raid but i thought to myself that maybe someday i'd have the time, i never thought &quot;i wish they'd take stuff away from the people that have time and give it to me too&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bradyznz</div><div class="date">2010-06-16, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To move back to the actual issue at hand, all Blizzard is doing here is offering a choice for you to decide which route you would prefer to take, 10 or 25 man raiding.<br />
<br />
No they're not, that choice already exists with being able to go to either 10 or 25 or even both. That choice is effectively being removed for a lot of players because majority will take the easier option leaving little choice for many others but to follow.<br />
<br />
I prefer 10man to 25, but I still enjoy them and would feel short changed if 25mans weren't really an option any more.<br />
<br />
These changes only look like they will reverse the situation by making 10man the norm, and 25's being there for the die-hards/elitists/etc, and many people feeling forced into 10man to see progress or due to lack of 25man groups available.<br />
The problem with this is that this *could* indeed kill off 25mans on a lot of realms, removing the option/choice, whereas current system leaves people doing 10man feeling 2nd rate but isn't preventing them from their preferred choice/option of raid.</div></div><hr />

I'm using the assumption that Blizz will be successful in balancing 10man content with 25man in terms of difficulty. Therefore the difference will be in organising them.<br />
Perhaps the answer then is to make 25mans a little easier, to 'balance' (in the broader sense) the two formats. Though this would put the 10man only at a disadvantage when considering the top tier of guilds, and round in circles we go....</div></div><hr />

Blatant support of 25-man over 10-mans. There is no reason to think 10-mans will be entry-level employees where as 25-mans are manager-level.<br />
<br />
Though, I will agree with Rryn on separate achievements, because no matter how close blizzard balances them, some bosses will just be easier in one over the other, and having separate achievements would be good shows of who beat the boss in the harder version.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Disagree there. Player matters not the raid compositions or anything else. It is way easier to find 10 good players than 25 (also undeniably the very reason for certain ppl favor 10s over 25s). That said, 10s is easier than 25s, especially when it comes to heroic bosses. Lots of guilds attempts 10s HM before they attempt 25s HM. So, generally speaking, 10s is the entry point, and 25s is what really counts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I actually feel really bad for you that you feel that WoW = life. Really.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did they just remove REFORGING? O.o<br />
<br />
No, they just took it from it being a side-feature of player professions; NPCs now provide the service.<br />
Lots of guilds attempts 10s HM before they attempt 25s HM. So, generally speaking, 10s is the entry point, and 25s is what really counts.<br />
<br />
The very fact that guilds do that with new encounters is proof that these changes are necessary; the guilds are not doing this because it's easier, they're doing this to learn fight mechanics and get their 25-man server/battlegroup/world first kill, because at this time 25-man kills are what gets the press. <br />
<br />
For this end, this is done only as an extra 50 attempts to learn the fight. If people would make a bigger deal about the world first kills from 10-mans, then you would see them testing out the limited-attempt encounters on 25-man first -- it's nothing to do with being &quot;entry-level&quot; or &quot;easier&quot;.<br />
<br />
read: the 10/25 man versions of raids were never supposed to serve as a learning mode for the other, but as a choice for guilds of different sizes to get as many as their people in and participating in raids. Hence these system changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My GM, who when the news of the new raid design first popped up said we'd keep running 25's, has now changed to saying that it sounds like 10 mans will be the most efficient way to play and gear up and that if 25's aren't worth running that he will probably quit the game altogether which will in turn probably bring most of the guild to also quit.<br />

I like to drink Tequila every once in a while but i can't afford a $500 bottle of patron so i drink the $30 stuff. Why does blizzard have to bring the exclusive stuff down to the lowest level possible?? People who can do stuff that others can't should be able to get the benefits and the others will still buy and drink the $30 stuff just as they have been for the last 5yrs.<br />
<br />
So are you suggesting you want to pay additional $$$$ to be able to access harder content above and beyond what the average subscriber pays? Good idea. :)<br />

10/25 will be far easier to balance and in fact 10 will probably be harder because of the limitation of classes for some encounters. Right now 10m is a joke only because you can pug 25m gear and then roll through 10m. If you've received a drop from voa25 you're already overgearing what it's tuned for. If you have a DBW or a 264 weapon you're overgearing it. If you have 245/258 gear from TOC/TOGC25 you're overgearing ICC10m. Yet people still fail. :) <br />
<br />
With gear being the same the difficulty can be balanced based on current loot tables instead of 10m or 25m.</div></div><hr />

You can't say everyone is finishing them with ease now. I'm sure most casual players don't see more than the first few bosses in ICC.<br />
Well I for one am a casual player and I can go as far as the group I am in can handle I have literally learned ever fight in ICC on the fly (actually every fight ever on the fly), its not rocket science. I for one am glad they make 10 mans harder than they are now becasue ts a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a pretty good post, but I have two things:<br />
<br />
1. People need to have a chance to practice to get better. To use your examples, you mentioned people being depressed after several wipes on a particularly hard boss. I think that's good (except for the depression part) because it shows that there are bosses that will still kill inexperienced raiders despite the claim that they are &quot;too easy&quot; and &quot;faceroll&quot; and such. This learning has to come from somewhere, and prohibiting people from getting a chance to experience this &quot;real&quot; raiding and learn from it will not help the situation. It doesn't help that so many outspoken &quot;pro&quot; raiders are quick to discredit any WotLK raiding achievements as such, barring a few encounters that are &quot;imbalanced&quot; because they in particular have trouble on them.<br />
<br />
2. Making completely seperate 10 and 25 and whatever arbituary raids doesn't work for the very reason above. One WILL be discredited as inferior to the other when 90% of the time the only thing holding back one group from doing the other raid is logistical difficulty rather than gameplay difficulty (at least after practice). And unfortunately, sometimes they are, despite the fact that those 10 people in a 10 man, for example, are much more important individuals in a fight than any one person in 25s. This should not be a problem but it has been for most of the expansion. No matter what has been done by a 10 man guild in WotLK, it's never good enough, because a 25s guild with the same fights in 25s man is *always* a &quot;superior person&quot; somehow, due to the fights not being properly balanced as they should. That should not be the case, yet Blizzard has made that clear for most of WoW's lifetime by rewarding lower man raids with lower quality items and lower difficulty on most encounters, reenforcing that bullheaded mindset.<br />
<br />
That being said, I think it is absolutely terrible that they are killing all real 25 incentive with so many crippling blows at once. I am highly critical of people who do what I consider to be QQing and even I am worried here. Some of them implemented would be perfectly acceptable imo, but not so many, especially when they aren't synergizing well with each other. There should be a higher loot % drop for 25s to reward 25 people getting together, because even though I said eariler logisical difficulty should not be a barrier to raid progress, there should still be a reward for overcoming that difficulty. The achievements should absolutely not be the same, because achievements do not affect gameplay and will not give 25 mans a gameplay edge over a 10 man group, but will still be a reward. In addition, limiting the amount of badge collections per week yet making the only 25 reward more gold and badges, and making absolutely every piece of gear and every epic quest obtainable in both 10s and 25s, is taking it way too far in the opposite direction imo. On this we can agree.</div></div><hr />

Eventually even the few 25 man guilds will die out due to lack of recruits and lack of motivation. Furthermore, I suspect that since the number of competent raid leaders will not increase (will probably decrease) while the number of 10 man guilds will increase, there will be a huge churn of 10 man fail-guilds and raiding as a whole will get significantly worse for the average raider - as a response Blizzard will nerf all the content to the ground.<br />
<br />
I believe the system will be a mess and practically kill 25 man raiding from the game. It would be far better if Blizzard designed completely separate 10 and 25 man raids (e.g., Kara/ZA vs. SSC/TK). Blizzard has made many great 25 man fights and many great 10 man fights. They have not made a single fight that great in both 10 mand and 25 man mode.<br />
<br />
I like how this posts reek fo stupidity, read the bold part.... If the system goes live in its current state... problem is. WE. DONT. KNOW. SHIT. ABOUT. THE NEW SYSTEM. <br />
I'll tell you what the current system you fear that will go live: It's the frikkin End-Of-The-World Conspiracies about dying 25mans... That's the system you think.<br />
<br />
Protip: Blizzard probably knows about that, and they're working their ass off.<br />
<br />
Their new design motto is: &quot;25mans will get more. Not better&quot; . Yes &quot;More&quot; can be considered as &quot;greater loot&quot; as in Greater amount, not greater stats.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xObserveRx</div><div class="date">2010-06-16, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two things:<br />
<br />
First, most of what I'm seeing here is QQ.<br />
<br />
People keep complaining about 25 mans going away because 10 mans will be easier. There's definitely some logic there. If organizing and relying on 24 other people for a win is too much work, it's only logical that if the same rewards are offered for relying on 9 other people instead, you'll do so. But when you sit back and take a look at the system now, how logical is it that you should have to rely on 24 other people, wipe over and over due to uninformed, lazy, or incompetent people simply because you want a better reward? That doesn't make you a &quot;better&quot; player than others. It does however, make you persistent. So I guess if that is the case, your achievements should all say &quot;I've dealt with morons for hours and hours and look! I finally got it!&quot; I totally agree that there needs to remain an epeen factor for those hardcore players willing to work at a more difficult (or possibly in the future, a more difficult version of an) encounter and achievements seem like a reasonable way to accomplish this. The bottom line is that in today's system, gear and gearscore are everything. People are willing to put up with shit they shouldn't have to just to have that (or get a chance at having that) higher GS. That's broken IMO. If you are willing to continue doing so in Cataclysm, the option is still there. This might not be a satisfying fix for everyone, but for some, it's definitely a bit of relief.<br />
<br />
The other thing is about blizzard forcing you into something. Some comments regarding this issue have been pretty reasonable and others are just ignorant. I'm just gonna throw my two cents in on it. First of all, no one, and I mean NO ONE is forcing you to do anything in this game. IF you feel that way, it's simply your subconscious need for better gear/ epeen factor motivating you to do so. You feel the need to deal with idiocy and failure to &quot;be the best&quot;. And if you've ever sat back and thought about it, how many people do you know are &quot;fail&quot; and have been &quot;carried&quot; through content only to receive rewards you KNOW they didn't/ don't deserve? Are they &quot;the best&quot; because they were carried through some tough content and reaped rewards you were unable to? Definitely not. However, you still feel the need to earn those same rewards. The only deciding factor in what you do (or in some cases put up with) in this game is you. I don't see how anyone would read this and think otherwise.<br />
<br />
P.S: I agree that a broken system (IE. Gearscore meaning everything) helps motivate your personal drive to &quot;be the best&quot; through persistence, but the single deciding factor still remains the individual player and his/her aspirations. The changes in Cataclysm may (notice how I say may) change this slightly, even if not done in the way most people had hoped for.</div></div><hr />

I honesty don't have the patience with those people that refuse to learn quickly any longer. <br />
<br />
Now if legendary weapons were 25m only. I would be inclined to run 25 instead of 10.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just want to bring a few things to the attention of all the &quot;hardcore&quot; 25 man raiders. <br />
<br />
You &quot;hardcores&quot; are the minority in this game. Casuals are the majority.<br />
<br />
WoW is a business. In a business, you need to make money.<br />
<br />
It makes perfect sense to me why all these changes are geared to improve the casual players experience. They are paying the bills, not you.<br />
<br />
Blizzard sold out, long ago. I'm sorry if this is news to you.<br />
<br />
Just to be clear, I've been playing this game since preBC when raiding 7 days a week was common place, and it saddens me to see how the game is in its current state. <br />
<br />
Luckily for me, I have many friends that still play and we've been playing together for almost 4 years now. So this game still holds my interest for the most part because of them. After years of playing together in a 25 man setting, we will be switching to 10 and Im actually looking forward to it. Mainly because it will be with those same people Ive been playing with for years.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Change with the times, or get left in the past. Crying about it wont change anything.<br />
<br />
Edit: Typo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malthurius</div><div class="date">2010-06-16, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To the people saying that 25-mans will die, and everyone will go to 10-mans because they are easier are forgetting that more gear PER PERSON will drop from the 25-man raids making them more attractive if you can get the people. What this means is that, say you get 1 piece of gear per 5 people per boss. This equates to 2 pieces of gear in the 10-man, and 5 pieces of gear in the 25-man, which means more gear and a greater chance of your must have item to drop from said boss in the 25-man.<br />
<br />
Now about the difficulty, Blizzard has plenty of time to fix balance. Here is an example of one fix:<br />
Say you have a boss that creates void zones, and in the 10 man he makes 1 void zone every 10-20 seconds. A dps stands in it and dies, oh shit, he's dead and we lose a lot of dps because of the smaller group, this is so much harder than 25-man could ever be. Here is how they fix something like this.<br />
<br />
In 25-man, instead of 1 void zone every 10-20 seconds, we get 3 every 15 or so seconds, making the risk about the same almost. However you are rewarded for getting the extra 15 people as stated before.<br />
<br />
Also, the addition of being able to split your 25-man raid into a 10-man will keep 10-mans somewhat active as well. Say you and your guild's core 25-man raid group start on the Skywall raid Tuesday. You get to Monday the next week and we still got 1 boss left, but people aren't showing up but there are some people that absolutely need the awesome weapon or awesome trinket that drops from this boss. So you convert the 25-man to a 10-man so you can down the boss, and still have a chance for your epic loots, since the loot will be the same for 10 and 25-mans.</div></div><hr />

If you aren't the raid leader then you put in no additional effort by doing a 25 man. Stop bitching because you will be exposed for the shit player you are when you can't carry your weight in a 10 man. The only people who deserve better gear are people who do hard modes. So you get carried in 25 man, not fuckin impressed. If 25 mans die, then they were ment to die and I'll be happy to see them go. But either way, wrath system or cat system, I don't care. I'm just tired of some of you fools acting like 25 mans should get better gear because you &quot;earn&quot; it. You don't. Tell the truth and say you want to be carried. It's cool, no one things highly of you anyway.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">powerstuck</div><div class="date">2010-06-16, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you say there are ppl who played this game only for fun. Why ppl who want to be best. In gear, in progress etc. Why they have to suffer? And I ask again!! What is wrong on current system?? Tell me. Its becouse ppl in 25-man recieve better gear? No you just said. They play for fun, they play for content but what for they need best gear?<br />
<br />
Edit: And one thing I dont have kingslayer title yet. Why? Becouse i am casual. I dont have time for it. But if I had time so I wanted to be the best. This is about feelings. And feel be differen epic. Is best motivation in this game... But no more..<br />
<br />
We all play this game for entertainement, that's true. All this tho, has been made by players. By us. Its a player caused Cataclysm...just think about the following. What was your gear score when you first succesfully did Naxx ? 1000 ? 2000 ? Not much higher. Ulduar ? 3000 at most. ToC ? 4000... When we all did Naxx, it took about 3 nights to clear it for my guild, who only run 10mans and had an estimate average of gearscore at about 1700-1800. It took your guild who runs 25mans 3 hours to clear it with the average of 2200-2300 gearscore. To me, it was fine. I didn't care spending 3x more time than you in Naxx. Nor did you spending 3x less than me.<br />
<br />
But now, when I'm asked for a 5000+ gearscore to do Naxx Weekly, there ain't no fun. You can say as many times as you want you don't judge by gearscore, but the first occassion you have you do it, by instinct. I know what I am speaking of...I do it too. <br />
<br />
The reality is, 25mans pugs that enter the raid and kill everything in it are rare breed...even more rare than 10/25m LK kills. Why, because in a pug, there is always someone who has to leave, can't raid for 5 hours, thinks everybody else is bad, etc. My guild is still working on our first LK 10m kill, but we raid 10mans, we try and individually pug 25mans...do 4 bosses collect 9 emblems then leave. We will get there, eventually, but we don't care, we just enjoy being with those people. <br />
<br />
Even if 25mans were easier than 10mans...we would still only do 10mans, just because. So for us, to get the same gear as people that will/can run 25mans is a good thing, because all this gearscore chapter will be obsolete. Because you won't be able to claim you're better than I am by doing the same instance with more or less people than me. Just think about what Blizzard always says, it seems to you and me that there is about 10 million forum posters out of 11 mil subscribers...but in fact its more like the other way around. So...what can the million of us voting yes or no do about what the whole group of 11 millions think of or do...not much.</div></div><hr />

I read all of that, and I agree with you. I some times feel that Blizzard has forgoten that challanges are fun too, and with out failure, there are no challanges.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spaceshaman</div><div class="date">2010-06-16, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, let's look at some current content where they admit to messing up and see just how hard 10 vs. 25 can be.<br />
<br />
The first thing that comes to mind is unbound plague. In 10 man, unbound plague is amazingly difficult to control because 1 minute across 10 people requires nearly everyone to participate. In 25 man, this isn't the case, with many guilds opting to just let it bounce around in melee for over half its duration. By contrast on the same fight, malleable goo is much harder to deal with in 25 man as well as the two oozes each needing individual attackers. Putricide is the perfect example of a fight which is balanced for difficulty for both 10 and 25 man raids, short of the obvious DPS requirement differences that exist because of how raiding is supposed to work now.<br />
<br />
Let's look at blood queen. 10 vs. 25 may seem like 10 man is easier at first, and you're probably right. You have much more room to spread out across the room for the air phase splash damage, there is less a chanse at dropping the &quot;purple poop&quot; on other players and you only need to link 2 people. The air phases are two minutes apart instead of 1.5 minutes, allowing WotF, Lichborne, PvP trinkets, EMFH and fear wards to be used much more easily.<br />
<br />
So what could happen in 10 man to make it more difficult? Howabout 3 air phases instead of 2 in order to make biting more dangerous? What about still having 3 people link instead of two, causing more motion to be necessary? Two people with the &quot;purple poop&quot; to fill up that space that would otherwise be occupied by 25 people? An added ability? 10 man could just as easily have been upped in difficulty, and in a few cases without really adjusting the fight mechanics.<br />
<br />
But then you will say, 25 vs. 10... why do 25 at all? Well, the reward will be greater in some way, but not so much that you are theoretically &quot;obligated&quot; to do 25s over 10s. The feel will be much more epic. The encounters will be slightly different.<br />
<br />
And even if nobody does 25 mans anymore, can you really be upset about that? Can you really blame people for doing the size of content they want to do? And besides... if there are more people out there like you and I who want to do the 25 instead of the 10, you're damn well sure that we'll not only find the people to make it happen, but we'll have fun doing it.<br />
<br />
25s will not happen. They (Blizz) just don't want to shutdown anything that players tag as fun. It's a recent trend of Blizz but I think a good one. So, 25s won't be cut out, but they definetely won't be mainstream anymore.<br />
<br />
You mentioned BQL encounter. Yes it's easy, if you gear your raid from 25s in 264/277 gear. If you run exclusively 10s you won't cut down BQL in 251 so easy. (From melee (I play one) perspective for example there's no 10 man trinket that holds a feint candle to DBW, even normal one.)<br />
<br />
Anyway 10 mans are fun. Karazhan was a major success right after the classic's 40s hegemony. Peeps enjoyed Kara even in the T6 tier. I for one welcome our new 10 mans overlords. :D With that said I'm in a guild that is after server firsts in this expansion, so if enough of us want to continue as 25 man raiding guild I will happily stay. ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that's not so much a blizzard issue, as it is a issue with the guild, is it not?<br />
<br />
If most of your guild is cool with just saying &quot;No one can ever show up, let's just do 10-mans.&quot; Then that's of course what's going to happen.<br />
<br />
The 25-mans are there for people who like to a 25-man, if people aren't willing to show up for 25-mans, they obviously don't want to do 25-mans.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is now giving players the choice to raid with 9 other people, or 24 other people; if all of those 9 or 24 people aren't on board and pumped for raids, it's not going to happen.<br />
<br />
Heck, last raid night we were missing about half of the raid because no one cares for ICC anymore. Even if it was only a 10 person guild, if only half of the raid cares (5 people), we still aren't going.<br />
<br />
25-man guilds will have the upper-hand here, because if only half of the raid comes, you can still go via 10-man, where is the lose here? I only see win for both 25-man and 10-man groups. 25-mans have a viable fallback plan if people don't show, and 10-man guilds can raid competitively.<br />
<br />
This kind of organization has nothing to do with which (10-man or 25-man) will be more difficult, which is what the min/maxing, or efficiency is about. Nor does this show that 25-mans will be less viable than 10-mans, it's all on your guilds preference. Note how I say guild, yes, everyone needs to be wanting to same thing (10 or 25-man) or it's not going to happen; a house divided anyone?<br />
<br />
As a last added note: If you real feel that passionate about raiding in a 25-man guild, you should most likely try and find one that is staying as a 25-man guild. If you would rather min/max, you will have to wait and find out whether the 10-man or 25-man version of the raid will be easier.<br />
<br />
(please tell me someone gets what I'm talking about, right? lol)<br />
<br />
Finally, some wisdom.<br />
<br />
---------- Post added 06-16-2010 at 10:26 PM ----------<br />
<br />
<br />
It's because I have this thing called a &quot;brain&quot; capable of reasoning and analyzing things. I don't need to get stabbed in the face to know that getting stabbed in the face would hurt...<br />
<br />
Why do you ask questions that are in no way related to what I wrote?<br />
<br />
People don't pick raids based on the number of people they want in the raid. There is a million things that go into that decision such as what rewards it offers and how much organizational work is required. All things considered to me it seems 25 man raiding is becoming obsolete in Cata.<br />
<br />
On the same token, just because you say it repeatedly, page after page, doesn't make you right either. Your opinion is uninformed or if it's not, give us some data.<br />
<br />
The questions seemed unrelated because you're set in your viewpoint and unwilling to consider Blizzard may be on to something.<br />
<br />
If I concede your point about rewards and organizational work, then again you prove the point out. The amount of loot and some other things (I can't remember the details (gold? points?)) may be greater in 25man than 10man. The organizational work for 25man will still be there. Ergo, if someone wants to make decisions on rewards and org work, they can STILL CHOOSE 25man over 10man. ZOMG. But based upon your shrieking, I assume you'll do 10mans because 25s are &quot;dead&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think the difference in our opinion lies in that I don't believe Blizzard would make a change like this without a LOT of thought and hard data.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ogemaniac</div><div class="date">2010-06-16, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think everyone understands that Blizzard intends to make 10s and 25s equally difficult. What is unclear to me, however, is which difficulties they intend to chose. Currently we have four different levels of difficulty:<br />
<br />
10: mouth-breathing face-roll easy to moderate, mostly the former<br />
25: pretty easy to moderately hard, mostly the former<br />
10H: moderate to very hard<br />
25H: hard to extremely hard<br />
<br />
Once we drop to two difficulty levels, which two will it be? Is there going to be a wider span of difficulties as one progresses through each raid tier, such that some bosses will indeed be faceroll easy, and some pretty tough (in regular mode), while in heroic, bosses in the same tier will start moderately hard and get crazy by the end? Or can we expect nothing but faceroll for the first couple of tiers?</div></div><hr />

I can give you one right now: increase the range of the ability for 10man so people have to spread out more and calculate number of tombs / player based on 10 / 25s./facepalm<br />
<br />
There are just a ton of mechanics that simply cannot be balanced to be equally challenging for 10 and 25 players. Only some examples (and something that YOU didn´t think of...):<br />
<br />
Spreading out a 10-player raid like a 25-player raid means having some people NOT in healing range since you only got 2 or 3 healers instead of 6 or 7 and they can´t cover the same space.<br />
In fights with a lot of adds+AoEing them (e.h. Anub'arak heroic) it is completely easy with up to two adds for every tank. As soon as there are more, you must have a hunter and/or rogue.<br />
You can´t tune the fights as close. Anub'arak heroic was nearly impossible to kill with 226er Gear for a Caster-Group until you started gearing up, but it was a walk in the park for every melee-zerg. A fight like Vezax would be the opposite: way easier with a lot of ranged rather than melees.<br />
10-man is just much more critical setup-wise. Arthas is basically impossible without a (disc-)priest. Sartharion3D (10 man) was impossible with Warrior/Paladin + Druid/Shaman healer while a DK as an MT was &quot;win&quot; (Druid was okay) and Priest/Paladin could heal it (and had CDs for the MT).<br />
<br />
<br />
In order to make them equally &quot;difficult&quot; you will have to make them more simple and they will be easier. And this doesn´t even take into account that it is always harder to<br />
find<br />
organize<br />
coordinate<br />
10 good players than to do it with 25.<br />
<br />
And stop the BS about &quot;people do what they like best, so let them if they prefer 10-mans&quot;. People LOVE the 2-year old heroics, do they? Ah, thats why everybody runs them endlessly. People LOVE to only see the first 4 bosses of ICC, right? Thats why they are farming them in PUGs. 99% of the people do what is most efficient...because it would be stupid not to.<br />
<br />
Also, there WON´T be more loot. They already said that. There will perhaps be more badges (that have a weekly cap that is probably wihtin reach even for 10-man raiders since there should be no advantages for people just playing &quot;more&quot; than others...most likely &quot;weekly + 10 man + dailies = cap&quot;) and more gold. Wtf? Who needs gold?</div></div><hr />

To the people saying that 25-mans will die, and everyone will go to 10-mans because they are easier are forgetting that more gear PER PERSON will drop from the 25-man raids making them more attractive if you can get the people. <br />
<br />
Amount of gear in 10/25-Man Raids<br />
The amount of gear in the 25 person raids will be roughly equivalent on per-person basis to the 10 person raids. <br />
<br />
So basically there will be no real incentive (gear-wise at least) to run 25 man raids.<br />
There are rewards like badges/gold for the additional coordination involved, but we are trying to avoid having gear be the reason that one style is better than the other.<br />
<br />
So no, people won't get more gear for 25 mans, they might get a few extra badges that are useless after a couple of months (i have almost 600 frost badges rotting away) and maybe some extra gold (which i already have over 250k of)</div></div><hr />

I, as a guild mater, put lots of time managing my guild. I know many of my guild members are great players however many join and continue to stay largely because of the glory of being the best guild on our server, and the exclusive chance to BiS items. Now, Blizzard is trying to remove both distinguishing factors, and I am deeply concerned.<br />
<br />
Of course I am going to do everything to keep them doing 25man raids. However, if the majority opt to 10man, or even if a few core raiders just want to run instances with each other, my guild will face serious issues, so does lots of other guilds. What I can foresee is lots of guild/server hopping (Reminder: to discourage guild hopping is the very excuse Blizzard use to remove the guild leveling tree.). This is quite disrespectful to people who put in real efforts managing their guilds. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, lets forget about those guilds that are farming Heroic ICC, they are good at the game but they don't bring more revenue to Blizzard than average players, including those who run 10s and pugs. Since it will be easier for average players to run 10s, a reasonable assumption is that each of those 10s team will require 2 tanks and 2-3 healers. Now comes the problem: do tanks and healers constitute 40-50% of the WoW population? Very unlikely. So, how many people will lose their only chance per week to those Cata raids? What would they do after they level to 85 only to find that NO RAID WANT THEM? Frustrating. Then probably followed by massive subscription cancellation.<br />
<br />
Lots of posts above that favor 10s are self-centered. They may be capable players but they just want to pick the fruits without spending time to cultivate. During my career as a guild master, I have met many different people. What I found out is that if you put in time, no one is &quot;FUBAR&quot;. To me, depriving someone's chance to grow is selfish.<br />
<br />
As a tank/healer, I am not worried about myself. I can pick raids. But I am worried for those who cannot get easy raid invites. Having single lockout and equal loot in 10s and 25s is not necessarily good news to you. It could mean no chance to raid, therefore no loot to roll on. Think twice.</div></div><hr />

Call me stupid or whatever, but isn't what you're describing just BC raiding, with a 10 man option? <br />
<br />
On the same note, BC raiding was either very good to you or very bad. Many players were locked out of t5 and above content simply based on the problem of finding people competent enough to complete the content (whether it was because of server, raid times, classes available, etc)and therefore got to play only about 30% of the raid content available in that expansion. I know some people will look at this and say &quot;well that just separated the good people from the bads&quot;. Having more patience (and hence more time to work through content) does not make you better.<br />
<br />
Moving on, I don't see why you should worry if you continue to be &quot;the best guild on the server&quot;. What does that have to do with doing 10s or 25s? You'll still have people with the same skill level, still have people who have BiS gear and still have the prestige of clearing the highest level of content. How're you no longer the best guild on the server?<br />
<br />
Lastly, if you believe that people who play this game aren't selfish, you're sincerely naive. I'm not saying everyone is a greedy prick/whore, but you play this game for YOUR benefit, first and foremost. You're working with other people toward a common goal, yes, but you're still looking to better your toon, not other people's. How many times do you hear of people complaining about how guilds (25s mostly) deal with loot and loot distribution. This is the core of selfishness in this game: everyone wants the best loot for themselves, regardless of whether or not giving it to someone else would help the guild more and therefore cause more boss kills (and loot) in the future. If you have found 24 other people who do not feel this way on any level, you deserve a medal my friend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because getting 10 people to do something right always takes less time then getting 25 people to do so. So if you still want to be the best on the server (considering the game will only have 1 achievement for it) you will do 10 man's.<br />

You are very right, no matter what people say being different and special is what everyone strives for and thus, that will come in 10 mans in an overwhelmingly large portion of the time. Sure maybe guilds like Paragon and a few others that are light years ahead of everyone else can still beat a good 10 man group to achievements, but a lot of the realm titles will end up going to 10 man groups in most cases.<br />
<br />
Every guild has loot drama every once in a while, but for the top guilds it's not a big issue because if someone quits you usually have a large list of people applying to get in, where it hurts is in the world 5000 ranked guilds that have trouble finding people that are even close to being competent without the &quot;i'll show up to raids after things are easily farmed&quot; and &quot;once i have the items i want i'll mysteriously disappear till the next tier is out&quot; mentalities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways in case you haven't noticed 25 man raid progression is not very good in Wrath, if you don't have a friend in a more elite guild or you don't kiss enough a$$ to get into one of those guilds you're not getting far into 25 mans.<br />

In fact I'd bet hard cash that most of you people complaining are delusional and don't even realize your 25 man raid progression has not been very good at all.</div></div><hr />

I love the fact that blizzard is making it possible for 10man raids to get the same gear as 25man. Hopefully 10mans will drop the same legendarys as well. <br />
The thing you guys dont think about is back in the days where epics were really hard to get because we had 40man rolling for items, lets say 30ppl of those actually played (if even that).<br />
And now see what this made to wow? Alot of people are playing the game!<br />
Atm I killed LK 25 HC and LK 10 HC and I'm not in one of those 25man guilds that has 5-10 retards in the raid anymore but alot of guilds do have those issues. If blizzard was tuning LK10HC to be done with ICC25HC-gear and not Icc10-gear the encounter would be as hard as 25man.<br />
I did &quot;of the Nightfall&quot; with naxxgear and the 25man version, and no I didnt zerg it. And imo the 10man was alot harder.<br />
Imo stop the whining and get your IRL friends back online and have some fun doing everything the game has to offer with the people you like. (and not group 4-5, who fails)<br />
<br />
And to all you world first guys out there. 25man will still be there for you, and people will count 10man world first and 25man world first, instead of just 25. <br />
<br />
Good luck raiding 10mans and remember again - Raiding with 10 cool awesome friends is alot more fun then having to wait for the dude who needs to help his grandma every 10mins (imo)</div></div><hr />

No you're wrong about the badge thing, it's not really an incentive to run 25 mans since there is going to be a badge cap per week which anyone can reach via running heroics and on the other hand people don't understand what they're doing with gear at all.<br />
<br />
Lets simplify things: 10 and 25 man raids will drop gear of around the same item level (NOTE THEY DIDN'T EVEN SAY THEY HAVE THE EXACT SAME LOOT TABLES), but 25 man raids will drop more gear per boss.<br />

I don't think you could be more right with this quote and the current situation with 10/25 man raids. This isn't like vanilla WoW where boss strategies were hard to come by and people couldn't find threads and threads of how to play their class. Getting gear is a joke with the current badge system and finding 24 &quot;good&quot; players to sit down and raid ICC isn't as difficult as people make it seem. Watch a vid, farm badge gear, get it done. Easy as that. With this current change, why will I want to run 25 man's when I get everything else from 10 mans with less coordination, less dps, less skill, and most importantly, less bragging rights? For a few extra badges for gear that's completely irrelevant because everyone else and their grandma's can get the same thing? Having better gear shows others that you are good. Otherwise, everyone will be walking in tier whatever because content is so easy.</div></div><hr />

All the guilds that are carrying 5 or more people will die, why does that even matter? 25 will be much more productive, and if you are talking about switching to a 10man guild than you probably should because you have people not carrying their weight in 25Man raids. Ghostcrawler even said in his interview that guilds aiming for world/server firsts will be aiming to stick with 25man raids. 10man hard modes will be available for the skilled the players that want to raid 10mans, so they can get equal loot without having to facepalm themselves with the force of a category 5 tornado when morons wipe raids in 25mans. 25man guilds will probably dwindle in numbers, but the ones that stay alive are the only ones that matter. If you really want the loot, the e-peen and or if you just like raiding 25mans you will take the time to find players that are skilled, that you get along with and have fun raiding with. 25mans will provide more loot, at a quicker pace, thus making progression easier. 25mans will reduce wasting loot that nobody needs due to the large loot tables and low amount of drops in 10mans. The casuals are happy, the hardcore players that want to the best are happy, the hardcore players with aching backs from carrying bad players are happy. I don't see what is wrong.</div></div><hr />

(Same argument goes for healers. For tanks it doesn't matter - you'll wipe either way)<br />
<br />
Confirm/deny?<br />
Can be both. The dps requirement for each player is not as high in 10man as it is in 25man due to bosses have such a vast difference in hp. Also it's a lesser chance that accidents caused by spreading happening due to fewer players spreading over the same area as in 25. Also the general damage you raid members take from abilities are lower in 10man as well so they are able to make more minor mistakes before a death might happen.<br />
<br />
The kind of class &amp; spec of the player that dies also have in impact. Say a feral druid die in both a 10man and a 25man. In 10man maybe 3 melee gets affected by that from the loss of the lotp buff, while in 25man maybe 7 melee gets affected by it. But in 25man you might have a warrior in a spec that can cover the same buff, so it really depends on raid setups as well.<br />
<br />
There are lots of more scenarios you can compare what the loss actually means for your raid. You can't just look at it from a black/white perspective of 1/5 of your dps or a 10% of your raid is lost because someone dies in a 10man compared to like 1/15 of the dps or a 4% of your raid in 25man.<br />
<br />
All in all I still think that balancing 10man to be just as challenging as 25man is not possible because there are to many factors in play.</div></div><hr />

Yes, i play to be the best i can be. I also carry a score card when i play golf. I do everything in life to be as good as i can, even if i'm bad at something i try to get better.<br />
<br />
We'll see where the game ends up in 6 months when the expansion comes out, they've already changed most of the things they talked about at blizzcon last year, so there is still plenty of time for them to hopefully make more changes.<br />
<br />
If you follow the thread a bit further and do some research you will find that a few pages later that Bornakk admitted that the current plan as he was hearing it was that 25 man raids would get a little more loot (6 items off of each boss in 25's and 2 in 10's is what he referenced) so he contradicted his own statement later on in the very same thread.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">winzi</div><div class="date">2010-06-17, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And yes, there is still gear reasons to do 25-mans. More badges = more gear. More gear drops per-person = more chances to get the weapon you want. And not everyone has that much gold or that many badges, and if you're going to use your own situations to defend your side, you're a little bit self-centered imo.<br />
Yes, more gear drops per-person does give a higher chance in seeing the item you want drop that's for sure. But at the same time the competition for that item is higher as well because there are probably more players in the raid that want that said item as well.<br />
<br />
Look at most guild runs from the beginning of ICC for example. You knew what items you wanted due to the PTR revealing the loot tables, those BiS items. As a result you had half of all the drops disenchanted because the stats on them, or the worthless procs made them subpar from what could potentially drop so no one wanted to spend dkp on a bad item. Especially with the weapons, most of them were even downgrades to items from the previous instance due to the lack of stats replaced by useless procs.<br />
There will always be BiS items no matter what Blizzard decides to do. Even with reforging there will still be that 1 item that will stand out from the rest making it BiS. <br />
Reforging will just add that one more step to achieve it, a bit more time before people figure out which item that will be after a reforge.</div></div><hr />

OMG. Start thinking befpore you post, please.<br />
<br />
The probability of players &quot;failing&quot; ist also 2,5 times higher in 25-man raids than in 10-mans. And if 2 or 3 players fail there, the &quot;percentage&quot; is the same as 1 player failing in 10-mans.</div></div><hr />
