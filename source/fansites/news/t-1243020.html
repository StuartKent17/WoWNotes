Patch 5.2 - No New Dungeons<br />
Zarhym has confirmed (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/282622614143381504) that there are no new 5 player dungeons planned for Patch 5.2.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvE<br />
Whose idea was it to remove &quot;Random Normals&quot; at max level?, and could you fire them?<br />
Not many players ran them. Most jumped into heroics as soon as they could. Why did you like them? Gearing up for heroic? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277532313682849793))<br />
<br />
LFR loot system is beyond terrible.Such a way extending content artificially by making no loot to drop.Pathetic..Just pathetic<br />
The drop rate is the same as it was in 4.3. Just a different mechanic. Gearing is intended to take some time and effort. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277537459200475137)<br />
<br />
Suggestion: For raid lockouts, just lock out rolls for loot, let people run as many raids as they want otherwise.<br />
Here's our concern: &quot;Main tank, I know you won't get loot but can you run the raid with us for the third time this week?&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276857874154672128))<br />
<br />
Do the devs think all offtanks really want to dps? I die a little inside with every new 1 tank fight.<br />
We offer mostly 2 tank fights, but with so many bosses in the game, it's going to get repetitive if they all must be. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277124757659455489))<br />
<br />
Is the plan in Mists to have raiders go through each raid and let the new ones pile up or use LFR to leapfrog tiers?<br />
Want to err on the side of the former. If you want to do 5.2 raid, you can gear up in 5.0 LFR. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276745143908966400))<br />
<br />
Any thoughts to being able to pass the ability to receive loot in LFR if you don't want/need to give others a chance at a roll<br />
That gets around the point of it being personal. Now players could beg you again. Begging was super awkward. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276509796667113472))<br />
<br />
Are you happy with tank balance in challenge modes? Most groups seem to strongly prefer a DK tank.<br />
Death Grip is really good. Shockwave is too though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276504626524737538))<br />
<br />
any reason why every weapon in terrace but Regail's Crackling Dagger (http://www.wowdb.com/search?search=crackling+dagger) is sha touched? <br />
The dagger is intended to be hard to get. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278618351314538496))<br />
<br />
Do you think shamans could get CD reset on reincarnation on raid wipes? Or at least shorter cd? QoL changes? :P<br />
Not sure we like the idea of shaman being able to die on every single attempt. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278617398318350337))<br />
<br />
In ramping up the difficulty on 10N, you now have some guilds used to clearing it for 4 years that now can't. That is not fun.<br />
You're saying that the current raid tier feels too hard on 10 normal? What bosses are problematic for your group? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278571430847868928))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Alliance get 25% buff when they control the tower in dominance offensive, but horde only get 1%. It is ridiculous.<br />
That is based on the H:A ratio of your particular server. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277213561841922051))<br />
<br />
on a general note if you can`t burst down a healer and you can`t oom a healer what are you supposed to do?<br />
You should be able to oom a healer. Our plan remains to nerf PvP healing once we feel like burst is solved. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277202796955172864))<br />
<br />
I hope you arent planning on leaving war/mage nerfs till 5.2 after hotfixing demo... would be incredibly annoying<br />
We are concerned that trinket nerfs were not sufficient in curbing mage and warrior burst. Discussing options. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277198774483439616))<br />
The nerf to PvP trinkets was pointless. You just nerfed those that didn't need it and kept burst still OP for those who did.<br />
A trinket with 5000 stats can be 20% dps during the window. That is probably too high for anyone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277203505167609856))<br />
This was quiet dumb, 10% cooldown? Lets just go get a pve trinket. Also, you only shaved 2 - 3k off damage that still globals.<br />
You lose a lot of PvP Power (5% DPS maybe) to get the PvE trinkets, but we will take steps if those show up in PvP a lot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277225497933533184))<br />
<br />
Just your fault for genius scaling. Why would you grants stats still anyway? Whats pvp power for?<br />
PvP trinks designed years ago back when 1-2 classes had timers. Now everyone does. Burst trinkets are fine. Numbers just too high (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277213375849705472))<br />
Doesn't make sense, fine but &quot;to high&quot;. Fine is how they were before. Just admit you didnt want to effect pve.<br />
The concept of clicky trinkets in PvP is fine. The tuning of PvP trinkets giving 5000 stats is not. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277224018472468480))<br />
<br />
Seeing mixed feedback about whether all PvP damage is too high or just a few overpowered spec or abilities still. Discuss if interested. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276485425424658433))<br />
I'm not sure how to fix it...but hey, I bet I could if I was getting paid for it!<br />
Fixing it is easy. Fixing it in the right way is not. It's really unfun in our opinions when you can't kill anyone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277536101793677312))<br />
<br />
PVP Power is only marginally better than regular main stats. Thats why it wont stop PVE trinkets in this case.<br />
But look at the PvE trinkets. Your'e giving up passive PvP Power for expertise. Or you can have clicky secondaries. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277238950421221376))<br />
<br />
Another Xpac which Casters R extremely dominant + warriors. They hv bttr cc, surv, damage vs. dks/rogues/rets. Caster &gt; melee<br />
In PvP? Most complaints these days are mage and warrior. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277124877465575424))<br />
<br />
Honestly though, why do you feel like mages/locks should have both blanket+interrupt in one ability? Makes no sense at all.<br />
Those two abilities are on our list as well. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276508060682424320))<br />
I'm getting slightly interested in that list. If you can post a blog on some primary PvP balance concerns, awesome!<br />
Yeah, probably good water cooler fodder. I still owe y'all one on alts as well. So busy... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276510306451193857))<br />
<br />
The problem is blanket silences. With the amount of burst and silences, you die before you can cast anything.<br />
Let's break that down more. Counterspell? Spell Lock? Silence? Anything else? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277538620531937280))<br />
<br />
i was wondering how you feel about removing Hard CC from the game completely.. Would it cause balance issues?<br />
We think it would cause fun issues. Knowing when to use the right CC feels smart. (Yes you can take it to extremes.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276754841597009920))<br />
<br />
What if CC worked so that there is a cast time for targets at range, but targets within melee brings it down to instant cast?<br />
We'd like to shift more CCs to cast time overall. Instant anything should be rare and we've let it get too common. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277534449212723200))<br />
<br />
Don't you think removing PVP Power would address many issues players have? Like burst and huge gap in gear between players?<br />
Players would just use the PvE weapons which have about the same DPS potential. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276775550452920321))<br />
<br />
I saw Blizzard apologise this morning. You guys need to read more ^^<br />
Yep. I'll apologize right now that we have overpowered specs in PvP when MoP launched. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276381790464262144))<br />
Mistakes happen; but beta feedback was ignored. You're still not even acting on PvP balance concerns!<br />
Sure we are. We nerfed Chaos Wave just the other day. Look at the 5.1 patch notes, and I'd bet most of them are PvP nerfs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276501119964966914))<br />
<br />
Community is even making surveys for you ! Just make abilities do diff in PvP/PvE game fixed<br />
Never understood the laser focus on this. Abilities do work differently between PvE and PvP -- just look at CC durations. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276380538640670720))<br />
<br />
Please admit removing skrimish was a mistake as well and bring it back soonish :&gt;<br />
I do wish we had not removed it. As I said, not many players used it, but it's clear those players miss it dearly. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276382850385838081))<br />
<br />
That's the PVE way of thinking. No serious PVPer will ever say that it should be gear=skill let alone gear&gt;skill.<br />
WoW is an RPG and rewards that improve your character are an RPG staple. Gear is normalized for tournaments where it makes sense. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276384867883814912))<br />
<br />
Twitter: PVP is ^%^ - No, it doesn't. Forums: &lt;well written arguments&gt; - no response. Seems you tweet, because you cant forum.<br />
Not sure my posting in the forums worked. Players expected a detailed analysis of any passionate post and I don't have that time (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276385307937603584))<br />
<br />
hey there you ever going to do anything about the bots in pvp. oh wait you might avoid this question or give us the usual BS<br />
It's something we take seriously, but the solutions aren't simple. Do you have suggestions of how to catch more of them? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278574109024210945))<br />
<br />
what are your honest quick thoughts of why people think Disc pvp is weak? <br />
Because they see mostly Resto shaman. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278571556249165825))<br />
<br />
Upgradeable gear is okay for honor gear, but it shouldn't be for Conquest, as it'll take months to catch up. Thoughts?<br />
Problem with catch up (PvE or PvP) is it encourages everyone to play less. We like playing more to feel like it's worth it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277878539150315520))<br />

Blizzard Christmas Gift and 20 Year Gift<br />
Nick Carpenter (https://twitter.com/FubarNick/) recently shared pictures of this year's Christmas gift (Treasure Goblin Statue) and 20 year service gift (Crown / Mask) on Twitter. There is a short writeup about the 20 year gift on Weta's site (http://www.wetanz.com/crowning-glory-for-blizzard-veterans/). <br />

<br />
I don't see why you would. It was a horrible model. When the HoT heroics came out, suddenly to get the best loot you had to spam heroics. It was a joke that HoT loots were better than previous raid gears, especially with how insanely EASY they were.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because I liked the dungeons? If loot is a problem, give them bad loot. I didn't run them only because of the loot, I loved the ICC and Cataclysm/CoT 5-mans.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Somebody</div><div class="date">2012-12-27, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So as long as they stick to this progression model for raids, we won't see new 5-mans?

<br />
Afaik, they want you to gear up through every tier of raiding so that they don't suddenly become forgotten. As in Cataclysm, once FL came out, T11 was hardly ever touched again, besides those few who thought it necessary to get the best possible gear. Then HoTs came out with DS and neither Cata heroics now the revamped ZA/ZG were very much seen again let alone BWD, T4W, or BoT. I think they want to see their content being seen by everyone no matter at what point of the game a player started raiding.<br />
<br />
That's not to say that there won't be VP gear available that will be on par or barely sub-par the current tier. Even fresh 90's should be able to work on the rep along side veterans to open their opportunity to buy the best gear. The only problem I see with this is that the original factions might not see as much attention when the gear they offer becomes obsolete.<br />
<br />
They are also going to continually come out with new scenarios as seen with 5.1. If you're looking for fun content to run with other people, that's where it would be. If your looking for something challenging to run with a group of 5, you might want to go for gold in all challenge modes - also think about challenge mode achievements being changed/added if new 5-mans came out. Would it be fun to just have 1-3 new challenge modes that award a whole new set of xmog gear, mounts and titles; would it be fair to add those requirements to the current achievements, especially to those just on the verge of all gold; would it be compelling enough to add new 5 man dungeons that didn't even have a challenge mode? There are too many people to please and just as many people who would be displeased on the flip side of a decision.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey man, don't get me wrong. I thought the lore parts of the ICC and HoT heroics was great. They were pretty fun. Most of the time, it was 3 people working at it and 2 moochers just getting free stuff. Why? Because it was okay to do that.<br />
<br />
I wish &quot;give them bad loot&quot; but I don't think you understand the shit storm of the bitching casuals that would ensue. &quot;why should I do this and get bad loot?&quot; &quot;Why don't I get legendaries from the new 'heroics' QQ&quot;</div></div><hr />

There is no way you could possibly know that and there are no past events to back up any reasoning. We'll just have to wait and see if it works.</div></div><hr />

No it wasn't.. maybe if you have down syndrome you might think they were horrible ideas, but it gave people who couldn't put the time into the game, a way to gear up. Also it wasn't like Dragon soul on normal OR heroic was even hard to begin with. I quit raiding little over a year now, and i would like to see ways to get gear, other than using Looking For Rage. Also the gear people acquired through the HoT heroics was on par with normal Firelands gear, and if you're clearing normal mode raids, gearing for heroics, what does it matter to you anyway? you're previous raid gear will now be replaced by better raid and tier gear. This argument is like the gay marriage argument, It doesn't effect your gameplay, it doesn't cause you any mental or physical harm, so why do you even care if some casual is getting some epics that mean nothing to you in the first place?

No, it is nothing like the gay marriage argument. Stop using straw man arguments. It discounts anything you say. And how do you know seeing the game I have played for a long time being dumbed down for casuals doesn't cause me pain? If you don't have the time to put into an RPG, then don't play one. <br />
<br />
What you want is to be able to KEEP UP with people who play more than you. You want as many purples as hardcore players in much less time, and that is bullshit. Did you do H DS? You call it easy, but also imply you only have time to use the LFR. Yes, its harder than the LFR.<br />
<br />
You are also probably the same guy that bitches about not getting purples fast enough, then later, typing with a yawn complain about how you have &quot;nothing to do.&quot; If you have less time to play, then you should live with getting less for less time. It was a horrible idea. You could easily hit 85, put some cheap BOE pvp gear in your bags, then just spam run HoT heroics, being a little leech on your group mates. THAT is another way it would affect me.</div></div><hr />

Well first off, don't assume i am one of those players who does not understand this game, I have been raiding for 7-8 years. I know what I have accomplished in this game, I have been in some pretty decent guilds, and co-lead a good group of raiders into heroic content. And yes, i do agree with you, I think it is bull shit that people can put items into their bags to just get ilvl to get an entry way into HoTs, but they have made it so where people can't get around just having an item in their bags. And no, it isn't about the number of epics someone has that you should care about. It is the item level of the gear. Also i wasn't implying i am one of the people who only has time to do LFR, i have time to raid if i felt like it, but i don't because I have lost interest in this game for the most part (Don't try to turn that sentence around by saying &quot;oh well you lost interest, and now you think you deserve purples&quot; because you would just be a moron, like you have been in your previous comments) <br />
<br />
And what the hell are you talking about with &quot;straw man arguments&quot;, i was making a comparison between how gay marriage doesn't harm anyone, but people get angry over stupid shit, like you getting angry at 5man heroics with epic quality gear, even though you partake in raids with a higher item level than the 5man heroics. Also if someone isn't meeting up to your standards for a heroic, then vote kick them. <br />
<br />
Btw, i used to be just like you. I absolutely hated the fact blizzard would let casuals have epics through 5 mans, I thought it was a cheap and fast way someone can acquire gear, meanwhile i work my ass off leading 24 people into hours of heroic bosses. But you need to step back from your self appointed throne and realize that you, and your rag tag team of raiders, aren't the only people that play this game.<br />
<br />
Also I have ran LFR right when it was available, 11 weeks + sha and galleon kills, sha every reset and galleon if the virgins didn't kill him while i was sleeping. And i have a total of 4 epics. Everything else has been bags of gold. And that gets annoying, especially when you use a coin to only get the same piece of gear, or a bag of gold. And that is when i finally had enough of the bullshit and just stopped bothering with LFR.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durandro</div><div class="date">2012-12-27, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Huh. So they don't give us new 5 mans, something the game is seriously lacking now (seriously, leveling in MoP with only two dungeons over and over again? Not fun), because of raid progression? So don't make them heroic only, and don't give them better gear! Simple!<br />
<br />
Not everything new needs to be at max level or progression.<br />
<br />
Yet we get more scenerios, that are generally worth doing once. And then never again. Makes sense...?<br />
<br />
Honestly scenerios are a waste of resources. They could all easily have been turned into 5 man dungeons.<br />
<br />
What gets me most though, scenerios are max level only. That boggles my mind. They rarely give loot, give a small amount of gold, no reputation, and no experience. So what's the point in them beyond the lore, which is only worth a single runthrough?<br />
<br />
Here's an easy fix. Real easy. Would improve the game MASSIVELY. Retune all low-level dungeons as scenerios, then add in max-level heroic versions. Then no-one needs to level up as a healer or tank (which are honestly rarely needed in dungeons as it is now!), queue times are faster and we get something to do at max level.<br />
<br />
And before you say low level dungeons help people learn how to tank and heal... Not really. Things change drastically at max level. And you need a healer just as often during a scenerio (tough luck if you don't have someone able to do off-heals)!</div></div><hr />

Removing the end-cap normal mode dungeons was fine, as GC said, nobody really did them. But they should have made more of the dungeons into leveling dungeons. For people who didn´t like to quest, they literally had to do each dungeon about 15-20 times. I believe there is only 4 of them.<br />
<br />

<br />
Because I liked the dungeons? If loot is a problem, give them bad loot. I didn't run them only because of the loot, I loved the ICC and Cataclysm/CoT 5-mans.<br />
<br />
I think they are just moving everything towards scenarios. It is one of the hallmarks of the WOW devs.. when they get a new technology, they abuse the crap out of it ( vehicle fights in wotlk, phasing in Cata etc). For MoP, they added the tech for scenarios and for increasing ilvls of items.. expect to see it everywhere.<br />
<br />
I am with you on more heroics. Not sure why they couldn´t do heroics with ilvl of gear around 473 - 483. A newer player would either do the new 5-mans for most of their gear, or run the 5.0 LFR for tier sets. Players who have been doing 5.0 LFR and reps wouldn´t get many, if any upgrades, but at least we could run semi-challenging heroics for our 80 VP.<br />
<br />
Current heroics are a joke. As a bear tank, I can almost solo all of them (with just LFR and rep gear). Already, many dps are figuring it out and are semi-afk through most of them. Almost every heroic I did this week, I had double the DPS of all of the dps ( usually like 60k for me, 30k for them). The really interesting part is the availablility of the Call-to-Arms satchels is increasing. I only queue when it is up, and it is almost always up for tanks. Another round of gear, and all the heroics will be down to about 8 mins to finish. that is not bad if you still need some of the rare mounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So let me guess...you leave your recount set to overall damage throughout the whole dungeon and pull multiple packs of trash and and act like the dps is bad or afk because they can't compete with your aoe dps. Game has changed. Blizzard wanted tank damage to be a factor. At the beginning of the expansion tanks were topping WoL on many fights because dps needed the gear to scale past vengeance. Fresh 90s probably won't beat you in overall damage, especially not on trash pulls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New dungeons are implemented as a means for either catchup gear or for something extra to do. Dire Maul was a late release, and it offered Tribute runs for extra challenge. ZA was released and had bears for those who were pounding away at Tier 6, and Sunwell's only instance was just a means to offer more storyline. Wrath offered the Tourney AFTER Ulduar as a means to offer a little catchup gear and break the monotony of Wrath Heroics (which you could not queue for at that point). Cataclysm offered no new dungeons until the final raid, just a retooling of outdated content. From Wrath through Cata, you could get your catchup gear quickly from badges. I know this had to cause problems with their subscriptions, as people were no longer tasked with actually raiding and staying active to stay current. With the implementation of LFR (especially staggered release), a person can now have consistent access to catchup gear and content. <br />
<br />
I think it's time everyone realizes that they are going to go with the model that worked for them and for most players - content should stay relevant for the entire expansion, requiring those with mains and alts to progress through the game like everyone else before them, and not just unsub every 3-5 months and await the next tier to come out and pound the previous tier through nerfs and spend a weekend getting the latest catchup gear in heroics. This Wrath experiment lead to the only people consistently staying engaged in the game being the high end raiders and PvPers, and that's just bad community design. Will be fun when 5.2 arrives.</div></div><hr />

We'll just have to wait and see if it works.<br />
<br />
Alright call me the oracle then. Most of the population will be on their mains and alts they've already geared, they'll be off doing the 5.2 lfr. The only people that will be queuing for 5.0 lfr are people new to the game/coming back, or newly created alts. That's not going to be a lot. You have all those people spread out over 7 days queuing. So any given time you're probably looking at 2 or 3 hours, maybe more before you'll get a group. When the group forms you're gonna have a lot of undergeared impatient pissed off people who more than likely put on some pvp pieces or bought some tank trinkets to gimp the system to get into it. You won't have raid geared superstars in there anymore carrying the baddies. One wipe and all those pissed off people are going to start a drop and kick fest. It will all just be toilet paper raiders, one wipe and they're done. Good chance the raid will fall apart and back to a 3 hour queue you go. How long do you think people will put up with that? They'll give up, making it even less people queuing.<br />
<br />
This will be a learning experience for Blizzard. They'll look back on this as an example of why they can't have raid tier progression. They'll have to make some new 5 man dungeons asap and just eat crow. I'm looking forward to reading all the QQ threads though.</div></div><hr />

No, its a straw man because those two things (raiding and gay marriage) have insanely little to do with each other. Its a bad comparison. ANYONE would say &quot;Oh gosh, marriage equality is a good thing&quot; so bringing it up in a debate about WoW is totally insane.<br />
<br />
It also doesn't irk me that 5 mans can give epic loot. Last bosses in heroics in BC dropped epics, but sorry kids, that was way harder than HoT heroics, and WAAAAAAY less purples. Even in Vanilla some bosses could possibly drop purples. HoT was a joke of set of heroics. Anyone who says otherwise is just lying to justify howw easy of a time it was. This is just becoming way too casual friendly. I fear the day when you start getting gear just for logging in 2 days in a row!<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for judging and assuming on your general attitude presented, but that sort of attitude is what I got out of it. Casuals want to &quot;keep up&quot; with hardcores even though they spend less time in the game, but that is wrong. What should happen is casuals should be ABLE to catch up if they planned to play more. Less barriers. I understand the BC problem. That was the too many barriers part. If I had joined around the time SSC was being raided, it would take way too much time for me to catch up. But in Cata, if I joined around the time HoT heroic came out, I would be in mostly purples in a very short amount of time, and thats a joke.</div></div><hr />

Content should stay relevant for the entire expansion, requiring those with mains and alts to progress through the game like everyone else before them, and not just unsub every 3-5 months and await the next tier to come out and pound the previous tier through nerfs and spend a weekend getting the latest catchup gear in heroics.<br />
<br />
Feel free to link your profile, so that we can see that you're finished Sha Heroic and ready to unsub - and on your alts as well.</div></div><hr />

It's easy to whine like a little spoiled kid, but at least have the decency to whine about actual pertinent stuff.. wow<br />
<br />
I wasnt whining at all, i havent commented on any change or spell, in this thread. I was just amazed that he didnt feel the need to name all the blanket silences in the game. Also he wasnt talking about just mage/warlocks bc silence is a spriest spell...<br />
<br />
Its easy to be an arrogant know it all little punk, but at least have the decency to actually know wtf ur talking about.....burned.</div></div><hr />
