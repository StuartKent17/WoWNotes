We wanted to remind everyone that Arena season 4 is coming to a close. During next Wednesday's maintenance on November 12th, all arena teams, as well as ratings, will be wiped and arena charter NPCs disabled.

Thus, Arena points will be rewarded for rated games played this week and players will be able to purchase Arena items that do not require a team" />

We wanted to remind everyone that Arena season 4 is coming to a close. During next Wednesday's maintenance on November 12th, all arena teams, as well as ratings, will be wiped and arena charter NPCs disabled. However, arena points will persist until the beginning of the next arena season, or until a player reaches level 71. Thus, Arena points will be rewarded for rated games played this week and players will be able to purchase Arena items that do not require a team or personal rating. Upon the close of Arena season 4, players at level 70 will continue to be able to play skirmish Arena matches against other level 70 opponents even after Wrath of the Lich King launches<br />
<br />
Arena season 5 is currently scheduled to begin on December 17th, and once that happens players who have reached level 80 will be able to compete in rated arena matches where they can gain arena points which can be used to purchase level 80 arena gear, as well as compete for end-of-season rewards. Players who remain at level 70 after Season 5 begins will only have access to play skirmish arena matches against other level 70 players. However, two new skirmish brackets will be made available (71-75, 76-80) for players who wish to hone their arena skills while leveling in Northrend.</div></div><hr />

Certainly since hateful and deadly gladiator chest, leggings and gloves allready drops in WG, and is IMO much easier obtainable for people within pve guilds..<br />

So, buying it for a lot of honor + a few arena points, or a little honor + a lot of arena points works fine tbh.<br />
<br />
It's the weapons that are primarily interesting, sadly they do require rating... sigh.</div></div><hr />

If you think that's bad it really isn't though. At 80 honor is piss easy to farm. My DK has 60k honor and I barely do anything beyond the daily pvp. Never spent more than an hour pvping in 1 day.</div></div><hr />

QQ more, getting 200 arena points isn't hard.</div></div><hr />

Probably that it's just a heads up that the date given in the blue is fast approaching.</div></div><hr />

If I hit level 80 AFTER arena season 5 starts, will I be able to participate in ranked matches and earn level 80 pvp rewards? Or will I only be able to join skirmish matches until the next season starts?</div></div><hr />

You will be able to participate as long as you are level 80 it does not matter if you hit 80 either before or after the beginning</div></div><hr />

<br />
Upon the release of S5, S4 prices will surely get lower....what happens to s3 and s2 ? Do they remove s2 completely and put S3 in the honor system like they did with S2 when S1 was removed?</div></div><hr />

Why would you want level 70 gear at 80?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tripp</div><div class="date">2008-12-04, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question hopefully one of you guys can help me out. <br />
<br />
I have stopped doing arena, will I be able to purchase good PvP gear at all with just getting honor? I used to do a lot of arena but have cut back on my WoW playing and was curious If it was still possible to get something. Thank you.</div></div><hr />

S4 gear is worse than blue S5.<br />
<br />
For priest set only without bonus/gems/etc :<br />
S4 : 145+35 resilience rating +344 stamina<br />
S5 (blue) : 227+50 resilience rating + 396 stamina<br />
S5 (top epics) : 271+50 resilience rating + 515 stamina <br />
<br />
<br />

No more, you NEED to arena (at least a minimum) to buy base pvp gear (set + weapon). Around 300 AR / item<br />
<br />
And if you wanna purple set/weapon, you need to achieve 1650-1800 for the first level (hatefull) and 1900-2200 for the top level (deadly)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ouch. Pretty unlikely I will be doing Arena at all though. Is there at least an set with resilience I can get no matter the quality? Not having any resil at 80 is going to be very painful.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">perera</div><div class="date">2008-12-04, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Tripp, crafters (tailoing, leatherworking, blacksmithing) can curently make level 80 gear with resillience.<br />
