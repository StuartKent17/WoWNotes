The Armor Showroom has been updated with Dungeon Sets 3. <br />
As I said in a forum post, I had to block people who used a mail from mail.ru to register an account, this is because of spambots mostly using this mail provider.<br />
<br />
<br />
Addons<br />
Considering the popularity of the latest addon-related post, I guess I can talk about them more often. <br />
Today won't be a compilation, but an addon, one of the best I ever used : Engbags (http://www-en.curse-gaming.com/downloads/details/3280/). <br />
<br />
This is probably the best bag mod you can get, it will split your items into multiple categories automatically, will let you set up new categories and move any item or any category to another part of the bag (and merge them as well). <br />
<br />
One of the latest feature is a search box at the bottom of the bag that let you search any item, and of course it works in your bank as well. The only real problem is the resource consumption which is a bit high but it shouldn't lower your framerate that much. <br />

<br />
Onebank/onebagg ftw.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-07-06, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't like baggins because it's not as intiuitive as Engbags, I didn't go too far into the settings but Baggins got a few annoying things. First the empty slot doesn't stay here when you move an item, if you get an item in your bank or at the AH, the whole layout will change instantly. (This has been fixed, Kirkburn (http://www.wowwiki.com/User:Kirkburn) is great and I suck.)<br />
<br />
Also, I hate having the same item both on the screen :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-07-06, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried it a few months ago (when wowinsider (http://www.wowinsider.com) made a post about it) and didn't like it. I don't remember why exactly but I switched back to Engbags :p</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyrican</div><div class="date">2007-07-06, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as i said. there is an ace addon called ArkInventory, give it a try, so i dont have to test which one is better :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alexoko</div><div class="date">2007-07-06, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i loved engbags also, but now i use only ace 2 addons, :-* so here you see arkinventory, (has the same features as engbags i think) and hey you save a bit of your access memory :P<br />

Other then that, I Love it.</div></div><hr />
