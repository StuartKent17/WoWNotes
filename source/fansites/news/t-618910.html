----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It's been a long time since my last compilation of patch changes on homepage ... and here it comes for Patch 3.0.2 ! It is now officialy confirmed on the european server alert &quot;This Wednesday there will be an extended maintenance to apply patch 3.0.2. Please note that all European realms will be offline from 02:00 until 14:00, Paris time (CEST).&quot;. As a reminder the downtime for US servers will begin at 2:00 AM PDT and end at approximately 2:00 PM PDT.<br />

If you've got any question or if you think something else is worth mentionning, post in comments or join us on <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch notes<br />
Final patch notes are available ! Check them out here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=818). Please note that they are the notes provided with the patch and it doesn't necessarily means that they're accurate, Blizzard already released content patches with unaccurate patch notes in the past and you might want to check in game before complaining about anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Existing content changes<br />
Before any question, please read the Patch 3.0.2 FAQ on official forums (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=6178530502&amp;sid=1)<br />
<br />
Once this patch is deployed, the following content will be disabled or removed :<br />
The Atiesh quest-chain will not be completable anymore.<br />
The Bear Mount from Zul'aman will no longer drop.<br />
The Onyxia quest-chain has been removed from the game.<br />
Naxxramas is &quot;removed&quot; from the game and moved to Dragonblight. (Unreachable until WotLK, obviously)<br />
The ability to get titles related to Tier 4 or Tier 5 content is being removed. Of course, players who got them before the patch keep them. (Hand of A'dal, Champion of the Naaru)<br />
<br />
Also, a few things are being changed or added :<br />
Barbershops are now available in capital cities !<br />
Achievements are being added to the game !<br />
The amount of experience needed to level from 60 to 70 has been lowered.<br />
New graphical effects are being added to the game, including the new shadow engine<br />
The Stormwind Harbor will be available, but you won't be able to travel to Northrend until the release of WotLK. However it does have a working boat travelling between Auberdine and Stormwind.<br />
The Caverns of Time have been slightly modified to add an entrance for CoT: Stratholme. The instance itself won't be available before WotLK, only the entrance is being added.<br />
Mounts and Vanity Pets are now trainable spells and the old items will be used to teach you these spells. Once a mount or pet is learned you can access it through the Character Panel. <br />
Various tokens like Badges of Justice or Honor Points are all merged in the new Token Interface. It will also remove the Badges of Justice and PvP Tokens from your bags to free up even more space !<br />
The in-game Calendar used to schedule raids or events between your friends and guildmate will be available by typing /calendar<br />
<br />
Item changes<br />
+Healing and +Spell damage stats are being merged into a single +Spell power stat. Healers' talents and spells have been updated accordingly to compensate this change.<br />
Items with magic school-specific damage like +shadow or +nature have been converted to +spell power as well. This include most of the TBC items except for some enchantments like Sunfire or Soulfrost.<br />
Protection Paladin and Tanking Warrior sets to reflect changes on the new mechanics. A lot of non set items are also being changed. See this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=15318.0). <br />
<br />
Raid changes<br />
Raids buffs, debuffs, and auras stacking have been revamped, please check this post (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/5640524782--changes-to-debuffs-buffs-and-raid-stacking.html) for more information and our raid composition simulation tool (http://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com) to see how it works now.<br />
All TBC raid monsters will have their health reduced by about 30%. (see this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=18788.0))<br />
The standard melee damage output will be reduced as well.<br />
Boss abilities remain unchanged, except for Illidan who won't use Shear anymore.<br />
To coincide with the upcoming new talents and mechanic changes for classes in the next patch, we are making some adjustments in existing raid content to provide a smooth transition when the upcoming patch is released. The creatures and bosses in raid dungeons that were introduced in The Burning Crusade will have their health reduced, and most will have their standard melee damage output reduced as well, but their spell and ability damage are not being changed. These changes are being made in all raid dungeons from Karazhan to Sunwell Plateau as well as the outdoor encounters of Doom Lord Kazzak and Doomwalker. On top of this Illidan is also doing his part and will stop casting Shear on players. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Class changes<br />
Of course, most of the classes spells and talents have been reworked, official patch notes aren't available yet and the latest PTR 3.0.2 Patch Notes haven't been updated in weeks and aren't accurate anymore. Right now your best chance is to check the updated skills and talents list for your class, you can also check the talent calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/).<br />

PvP<br />
End of Season 4<br />
We’re currently planning to end the fourth Arena season on October 14, 2008, and as always -- this date could easily change. This Arena Season is only ending in respect to the ladder, meaning we'll be taking a snapshot of the season's ladder and then go through our normal process to determine who is eligible for the end-of-season rewards. This process should take approximately one week. It's very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for the arena-specific title and/or Armored Nether Drake to refrain from transferring their character to another realm between the date outlined above, and when the end-of-season rewards are physically awarded.<br />
<br />
Upon the end of this Arena Season, teams and ratings will not be wiped, and will carry forward allowing players to earn points each week and purchase gear until the launch of the expansion (November 13, 2008). <br />
<br />
<br />
New Arenas<br />
Two new arenas are being added to the game, the Dalaran Arena and the Orgrimmar Arena.<br />
<br />
Dalaran Arena<br />
The main feature of the Sewers is a huge pillar of water at the center of the main platform of the arena. The water is activated periodically and will knockback anyone in its way. As long as it's activated you will be able to fight very close to it but you will get knockbacked again as soon as you touch it. Players starts in pipes above the level of the room, to prevent people from staying in these pipes players are automatically &quot;pushed&quot; out of these pipes at the beginning of the match. <br />
<br />

<br />
Short video preview (http://files.filefront.com/dalaranarenawmv/;11829470;/fileinfo.html)<br />
<br />
Orgrimmar Arena<br />
Orgrimmar Arena also has a bunch of interesting mechanics. The first one are elevated platform in various places of the arena, they will go up and down on a non-random timer and will let players fight on higher grounds than their enemies. Also, a strip of fire will be periodically activated at the sides of the arena and will debuff anyone going through it with a DOT inflicting 10% HP damage each tick, lasts 3 ticks. If you ever get crowd controlled in the fire you won't get chain dotted and the dot won't reinitialize itself after the first 3 ticks. Also, please note that teams are starting very close to each other in this map : teams enter the arena by using the two elevators at the center. <br />

Honor Rewards<br />

<br />
Please note that your honor points or battlegrounds marks are NOT being reset with the patch or even WotLK. <br />
We had hoped that the introduction of some new Honor rewards in the upcoming patch would give players a great opportunity to spend any of their remaining Honor. However, many players would still be surprised by an Honor and token reset as it isn’t something we’ve done in the past. As such, we've decided to not reset Honor or tokens upon the release of Wrath of the Lich King. Players who save their Honor will be able to spend it on level 80 rewards, although those rewards will be significantly more expensive than their level 70 counterparts. <br />

Achievements<br />
Achievements are here ! We've got a list of all achievements available for all categories, but if you want to go in depths I guess you can always check Wowhead. Note that Feats of Strength aren't real achievements (they won't reward any Achievement point or title / tabard) and are only here to reward your for your past success ! <br />
<br />
Most of the achievements completed will award Achievement Points, they are only used as ranking purposes and you're probably going to spend a lot of your free time completing all of them just to have more points than your guildmates. <br />

Inscription<br />
A new profession is being introduced to the game, the Inscription. they can of course create the class glyphs used to improve the spells of all classes (see below), but there are also a few more things they can do.<br />
<br />
They can create Vellums (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?search=Vellum) used by enchanters to store their enchantments for later use. Basically, this is the item used to sell enchantments at the Auction House.<br />
Inscribers can also make Stats enhancement scrolls (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?items=0.4) like the Scroll of Strength IV (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=10310) or any other scroll. They can also create Scroll of Recall (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=37118) but its use will be restricted to other inscribers. <br />
And well, Class Glyphs, obviously. <br />
For more information check the full list of inscription recipes<br />
<br />
To create most of their items, Inscribers will need a parchment (bought from NPC vendors) and Inks. The inks are created with pigments obtained by milling herbs gathered by herbalists. (It works the same way as prospecting for jewelcrafters)<br />
<br />
Alabaster Pigment (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=39151) - Peacebloom, Silverleaf, Earthroot<br />
Dusky Pigment (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=39334) / Verdant Pigment (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=43103) - Mageroyal, Briarthorn, Swiftthistle, Bruiseweed, Stranglekelp<br />
Golden Pigment (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=39338) / Burnt Pigment (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=43104) - Wild Steelbloom, Grave Moss, Kingsbloom, Liferoot<br />
Emerald Pigment (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=39339) / Indigo Pigment (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=43105) - Fadeleaf, Goldthorn, Khadgar's Wiskher, Wintersbite<br />
Violet Pigment (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=39340) / Ruby Pigment (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=43106) - Firebloom, Purple Lotus, Arthas' Tears, Sungrass, Blindweed, Ghost Mushroom, Gromsbloom<br />
Silvery Pigment (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=39341) / Sapphire Pigment (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=43107) - Golden Sansam, Dreamfoil, Mountain Silversage, Plaguebloom, Icecap<br />
Nether Pigment (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=39342) / Ebon Pigment (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=43108) - Outland herbs<br />
Azure Pigment (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=39343) / Icy Pigment (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=43109) - Northrend herbs<br />
<br />
Again, for more information check the full list of inscription recipes. If you're in need of a leveling guide I guess you can always check this one (http://epicbewts.googlepages.com/inscription.html) or this one (http://www.elsprofessions.com/inscription/leveling.html) or even this one (http://almostgaming.com/wowguides/wow-inscription-guide).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Glyphs<br />
Class Glyphs are a new type of items created through the new Inscription profession, they allow you to change the stats or mechanics of your spells by slightly modifying their stats.<br />
<br />
In your spell book, you will find the new Glyphs interface allowing you to access 6 Glyphs :<br />
<br />
3 Major Glyphs - Major Glyphs will most of the time modify your spell with powerful upgrades like a damage or range increase, or even additional effects to your existing spells. <br />
3 Minor Glyphs - Minor Glyphs will mostly provide cost reductions for spells (Mana or Reagents) and also a few cosmetic changes. <br />
<br />
After buying your Glyph at the Auction House or from an inscriber, you will have to be near a Lexicon of Power to use it (this is a forge-like item available near most of the Inscriptions trainer).<br />
<br />
When you use a Glyph on a slot, the Glyph is destroyed and the effect added to this slot. You can also overwrite old inscriptions and replace your old effect with a new one whenever you want.<br />
<br />
Glyphs are unlocked through leveling and if the Live 3.0.2 version match the Beta one, you should be able to use 2 Major Glyphs and 3 Minor Glyphs at level 70 on live servers, this is still unconfirmed though :<br />
<br />
Level 15 : 1 Major / 1 Minor<br />
Level 30 : 2 Major / 1 Minor<br />
Level 50 : 2 Major / 2 Minor<br />
Level 70 : 2 Major / 3 Minor<br />
Level 80 : 3 Major / 3 Minor<br />
<br />
Below is a list of class glyphs sorted by class : <br />

Already a few mirrors up on a.wirebrain from the looks of it.<br />
<br />
The glyphs seem very lacking still, but blizzard has already stated more will be added.<br />
A 4th glyph slot right now would simply make room to add the 4th major glyph, which is already the 4th choice, so not likely to have a huge impact in power.<br />
<br />
I wonder if all the professions are done yet, as the talents certainly aren't.<br />

I'm installing the 3.0.1 to 3.0.2 update now. I'm curious what build we're gonna end up with (last PTR build or a future build no one has seen before with yet more unannounced changes).<br />
<br />
Yes, the patch notes listed while it installs are way out of date. Several of the mage listings are old, at least.<br />

Edit: Okay, done installing 3.0.2 patch. It's build 9056! Beta's 9061 so this could be *slightly* older and be missing a few changes. Will have to see what differences there are, if any, when people start datamining.</div></div><hr />

GC posted in the DK forums. http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10971913982-are-dks-done--for-now-at-least.html sooo.. i think it means he wants the most recent beta build talents to be implemented. all speculation though. he never really outright said it was. but the way he implied it.. ahhh. lol.<br />
<br />
So it seems official PATCH NOTES are up... and I was right: these are the OLD patch notes from the FIRST PTR BUILD. Damn I hate Blizzard sometimes. Look at that, under Hunter notes: &quot;Aspect of the Viper - The hunter takes on the aspect of the viper, instantly regenerating mana equal to 100% of the damage done by any ranged attack or ability, but reduces your total damage done by 50%. Only one Aspect can be active at a time&quot;. WRONG... This is now changed and mana regen is based on weapon SPEED, not DAMAGE. Baaaaaah!<br />

Meh, it's better this way really- it let's the majority of the player base figure out the specs they want to level with, get used to the new abilities, and gives some feedback testing on a massive scale before the release of the X-pac. It's just a month. It'll be alright, I promise.</div></div><hr />

yes..... The thing is, that hardly any of theese have a trainer on them, and then only the ones taught in dalaran/howling fjord.

I could be wrong on this, but I believe that it is major glyphs that are trainable and the minor glyphs are discovered by doing the research. At least that is how I remember it from PTR when i was toying with the idea of going inscription, which I will be doing this afternoon after I take care of the necesssary speccing isues and getting my mounts and pets out of my bags and bank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep. Achievements. Which will almost certainly keep things going for a few weeks, as we may see loads of old-content raids etc. You know, for fun? Plus, there's probably an opening event sometime in the next few weeks. The TBC one involved Kruul stomping through Ironforge, and killing demons at the dark portal. I'm hoping for a re-run of the Naxx opening event, or something just like it. PEWPEW!! AOE!!<br />

Where before it was special, as it was the only mount that worked both inside AQ40 and everywhere else. All other AQ40 mounts didn't work outside AQ40, and all other normal mounts didn't work inside AQ40 beyond the first boss.<br />

this is mostly as a result of the mount storage thing, they'd want all mounts to do the same thing i guess</div></div><hr />

You are confused. The link you have is for discovering Major Inscriptions that require Northrend mats, which is not the ones that were on the PTR.</div></div><hr />

I think its funny all the new comments about stuff, but to be suspected. I guess in all reality, this patch is just making the PTR live. Really nothing else. This whole patching process sucks though.....<br />
<br />
<br />
What is a better way to get these content updates out? Do you want a CD to come in the mail? I agree that the time it takes to patch and the process is kind of a pain. However, think about how amazing it is that they can these updates out rather seamlessly. I have been updating all the patches since they started releasing them two weeks ago and when I get home from work today I'll be able to log right in. There are lots of sites hosting the patches separately if you don't want to use the blizzard tool. You can even use your own torrent client for their patches if you want, you just won't get the http direct download that was boosting my download by 100k/s this morning on my dsl line.</div></div><hr />

waitwut? explain plx.<br />
<br />
<br />
I actually took the time to register to answer this comment...<br />
<br />
Anyway. When the Beta/PTR was launched... Scarab Lords (Holders of the Black Qiraji Resonating Crystal) were amazed to find out that when their bug was taken to Outland or Northrend, it changed its appearance to become a flying mount! (Looked like The Marsh Stingers in ZM) Many speculate that it was supposed to be to promote the status of the Legendary Mount, and get more use from the players who spent their time getting it.<br />
<br />
While many screenshots were produced during these builds, it has been reverted back to just being a bug. They hinted at maybe changing in in the future, but nothing was finalized.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, if you only have to buy the riding skill at that level for ONE character. If you're doing it for 4-5, on the other hand, the price discount matters a little more. ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are mistaken. That is good news. There's 1 month of 70 left before WotLK hits, we will survive not being balanced for that period. <br />
<br />
Balancing for 70 for something that will be an 80's game shortly is not a good idea. When the pre-TBC patch hit, hunters were op in BG's due to the low health of players in Vanilla wow and the lack of resilience. So multi shot and arcane shot was nerfed across the boards, as we were 2-3 shotting players in BG's without a problem. <br />
<br />
So we were nerfed to fit with level 60 complaints on abilities meant for lvl 70, and lo' and behold - when TBC hit and hunters reached 70 - arcane and multi shot barely made a dent in what had gone from 2.5-3k health players to 10k+ health players, with resilience to boot. <br />
<br />
Now, you may not be a hunter. But whatever your class is, you really don't want your class to be balanced for 70 for what is going to be an 80's game.</div></div><hr />

Some realms keep going from recommended to locked and back again. It's like watching the Press Your Luck board flash. But I guess it's because you have those people who can't stand to wait for their realm to come up rolling and lagging out other servers. ._.</div></div><hr />

You're reading old patch notes. Latest &quot;real&quot; patch notes are updated and reflect the latest PTR build... so we should have everything supposed to be in for levels 1-&gt;70.

While I can agree with your reasoning, if Blizzard would just admit that things are broken, I'm sure people would stop with as much QQ.. Instead.. they went live.. and things broke.. horribly. The mount/pet tab &quot;disappeared&quot; after logout.. I found myself mounted on my ROFLcopter, with no roflcopter to mount. Was pure epic.<br />
<br />
It's just a sign that shows that the PTR really does nothing to bugfixes and troubleshooting.. well. &quot;nothing&quot;.<br />
<br />
Alt+clicking items should provide feedback ON LIVE realms too.<br />
<br />
I also wonder how much of this is pure manufactured fail on Blizzards behalf to show Vivendi/Activision that PRODUCT IS NOT READY FOR LAUNCH.</div></div><hr />

What's wrong with Inscribers? Verb from inscription is to inscribe, so the noun that comes from that is inscriber (ie someone who inscribes or performs the art of inscription).</div></div><hr />

<br />
then servers go up.....then &quot;Ok afterall X thing isnt working. bring them down again and fix it&quot;. i think it works like this.<br />
<br />
ofc i might be wrong. anyway i bet that by tonight everything wil be 99,9% working.<br />

i was hoping the oposite, that they just keep ve as always was,<br />
and dots increased with crit when you dont have any crit from talents and your gear is spelldmg based is a ****<br />

I don't mean the WotLK changes to shadow priests, I mean the 'upcoming shadow changes' (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/11224022301-upcoming-shadow-changes.html) post that bibi linked in the news post. I liked old VE mechanic too, but it didn't fit what they were trying to achieve (with hunters and ret pallies doing the same, they wanted 100% equivalency).</div></div><hr />

<br />
All instance. Did Kara and ZA clears yesterday, it wasn't really fun between our dps increase and the mobs health decrease, they went down like bigger trash mobs :/</div></div><hr />

Bigger *2.4.3* trash mobs, the trash now is even more of a joke than the bosses. As a 1600 armor Warlock, *I* can tank trash, as long as the healers see that I have aggro.<br />
<br />
Everything's just AOEed down now.<br />

<br />
