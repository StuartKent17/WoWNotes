<br />
Nothing about Sylvanas' life as a High Elf mattered beyond what we already knew, and she's been a major character since her introduction with no downtime that wasn't explained/explored. What possibly more can we learn about her?<br />
<br />
Similarly for Jaina. The only thing they could possibly do is explain wtf she was doing for all of Legion beyond a sentence of, &quot;Off fighting Demons.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah well at least Azshara will be interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game should have a healthy balance. I'm happy more female characters of prominence are being created or expanded/refocused for BfA, but there seems to be no actual male character of importance in the story. Anduin is the closest you could get and he's absent outside of the introduction event and a single quest wayyyyyyyyyyyyy later on at the end of 8.0.<br />
<br />
I'm down with Talanji and Katherine Proudmoore, and I've always liked Jaina, but it would be nice to have just one male character that mattered. I guess you could count Rokhan, but that's really just for one zone of one faction.</div></div><hr />

SHouldn't you be all triggered and bitchy over them being sexualized and scantily clad? Or do you change your feminist methodology to suit the internet stranger you want to try and attack on a personal level as the need arises? <br />
<br />
Go to your safe space. I'm gay, sweetheart, so your manchild insecurity comment has ZERO power with me. I wanna see some scantily clad MEN with some power for a change. One that isn't green with tusks.</div></div><hr />

Calm down captain butthurt, I'm not bitchy about anything. Honestly couldn't give half a fuck about how women dress or what gender main characters are. It's no secret however that people overreact as all holy hell in here as soon as a female character gets a leading role / stronger role because &quot;SJW&quot; and &quot;political correctness&quot;.</div></div><hr />

But why can’t we get something to show saurfangs struggle ? Maybe focus on other leader of the horde , filled up with sylvanas since legion . Or what happend to wrathion x anduin.

<br />

<br />
He shouldn't be the High King of the Alliance in the first place. High King wasn't an inheritable position from wielder to heir, it was a title that was given to serve as Grand Commander of the Alliance's military forces by all the other leaders. Every other leader has far more experience commanding armies than Anduin does.</div></div><hr />

You really don't. They never tell you why Zul and Talanji are in the Stockades. Just that they are, somehow Sylvanas knew about it, and so you have to rescue them to get the Zandalari fleet.</div></div><hr />

But Azshara though, I want to see her's because that's stuff we've never really seen before. We know her and her people are going underwater and a whisper makes a deal with her to save her people and we know 1000's of yeas later that they're naga, but I think it would be really cool if they explore how they become naga and whatever else happens to them down there.<br />
<br />
Jaina's imo, is just 'meh'. Don't care for her and her recent regret in helping the Horde fight her father. it'll probably be more bs of why she didn't help us fight the Legion.</div></div><hr />

I for one love strong female characters taking lead, but it does seem suspicious that it went from mostly male leadership to mostly female in such a short time. I like all the horde allied race leaders, individually, but when you pull back and see they're all female... idk, makes ya wonder.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HighlordJohnstone</div><div class="date">2018-07-16, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What the hell else can we possibly learn about Sylvanas or Jaina.<br />
<br />
Nothing about Sylvanas' life as a High Elf mattered beyond what we already knew, and she's been a major character since her introduction with no downtime that wasn't explained/explored. What possibly more can we learn about her?<br />
<br />
Similarly for Jaina. The only thing they could possibly do is explain wtf she was doing for all of Legion beyond a sentence of, &quot;Off fighting Demons.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah well at least Azshara will be interesting.<br />
<br />
It's to show that &quot;THESE WOMEN HAVE GONE THROUGH A LOT IN WAR! HOWEVER, THAT ONLY BUILT THEM UP, BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL STRONG, INDEPENDENT WOMEN!&quot;<br />
<br />
Even though 1's a servant of the Old Gods, therefore she's pure fucking Evil. The other one wants to protect the Horde from the Alliance, even though the Alliance has NEVER shown any signs of aggression yet (Oh, and during the whole Stormheim BS, she tried controlling a fucking Val'kyr under the rule of an Evil, twirling mustache, Disney-esc Death Goddess). And the other one's been crying in a fucking corner throughout most of Legion. <br />
<br />
...MEANWHILE, I want to see more of Anduin, and how he's starting to put on the fucking Armor to go to War. Maybe give him a short story of his dilemma with Sylvanas, and shit. Maybe have him train underneath Genn or something like that for a bit. Maybe give him a reason to fear War, only to have a pep-talk with Genn/Velen about leadership, and taking up the mantle as a High-General of War. <br />
<br />
Ya know, something that DEVELOPS THE CHARACTER!<br />
<br />
Similar thing's occurred with Khadgar. You saw him go to Karazhan, trying to find the answer in stopping the Legion. You saw him face off against a Dreadlord who was trying to manipulate Khadgar. You saw Khadgar giving reasons why he didn't want to be the Guardian of Azeroth. You saw him find the answer to everything.<br />
<br />
Hell, Harbinger's at least had the benefit of the doubt in giving us certain Character's story-arcs. <br />
<br />
We knew NOTHING of AU Gul'dan's past, and how he came to be with the Legion and shit. Nor did we know much about Illidan's missions with the Illidari. So, when we finally got to them, it was such a breath of fresh air, since...well...we finally knew more about these Characters.<br />
<br />
But, here, we're getting none of that. I mean, Sylvanas' shit in Warbringer's is basically told in WC3. Jaina's shit is basically going through what the Comic already told us. And, with Azshara, we already knew about what happened to her in the WoTA trilogy. (Though, finally seeing HOW it happened is...well...quite a neat little thing to experience, don't ya agree)<br />
<br />
So here, unlike with LoTC and Harbingers, we don't feel as intrigued with these characters as we should be. And that's mostly because we've already known about their Story-lines from WAY beforehand. With LoTC and Harbingers, they gave us backround info about Characters we don't really know about (In terms of AU, or in terms of their lack of info from way back then). <br />
<br />
So, with Khadgar, Gul'dan, and Illidan, you never saw these things about them. So, when you finally got backround info on them, you actually felt intrigued cause...well...it's new. <br />
<br />
And with the LoTC trilogy, you felt as if you needed to know more about these Warlords. You were in Varian's footsteps throughout most of the Animated Series. You wanted to know more about them. You needed to know more about them. You had to know just how their past experiences forged them into great leaders. Cause, you actually never knew about their past beforehand. However, here in Warbringers, you do. It's all just a recap, basically. And that's where I think the short story series is going to fail, MISERABLY! <br />
<br />
It's because, well, we've already gone through this before. It's been told plenty of times beforehand.</div></div><hr />

High King wasn't an inheritable position from wielder to heir, it was a title that was given to serve as Grand Commander of the Alliance's military forces by all the other leaders. Every other leader has far more experience commanding armies than Anduin does.<br />
<br />
And this is why we need a Warbringer's about him. It's because we NEED to show Anduin's dilemma as a High King. We need to see him grow. We need to give him a reason to fight in that Armor he's got on in BFA. <br />
<br />
But, without any reason for as to why he's High King. And without any growth into Anduin's character, then everything here just seems rather &quot;forced&quot;.<br />

<br />
I struggle to think of what the shorts will have to say. We know Sylvanas's story inside and out by now. Defend Quel'thalas, get Frostmourne'd, become despot, descend into villainy, the beats are known. Same with Jaina's emotional rollercoaster of hating, loving or being indifferent towards the Horde that day depending on what the dice rolls. <br />
<br />
The Azshara one will probably be the most interesting as it will offer her perspective, villainous as it is. So I expect it to be the best just like Gul'dan's was for Harbingers, where the Dadgar one was decent and the Illidan one was just a series of catch phrases with cool art.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The legion ones aren't as bad as the WoD ones, but they are still pretty wasted. We had no reason to be reintroduced to Gul'dan and Khadgar, they are pretty much short stories stating the already known, that Khadgar will join in the fight against the Legion and that Gul'dan is evil and hateful. The illidan kinda helps understand the good side of him, since Blizz remade his character for Legion, but it was still at kinda replaceable by the DH starting zone.<br />
<br />
The short stories gives Blizzard the ability to explain character thought, development and evolution, that they could not do in-game, yet they waste them on either setting up fake characters(characters that aren't like that in-game(watch the Kargath short)) or stating the obvious.</div></div><hr />

Yes? He's clearly telling the Alliance when not to, and when to do shit. And he's also trying to keep Sylvanas/The Horde under check, so that he could make a Peace offering with them. <br />
<br />
However, Sylvanas sees War as the only way, and thinks that the MOST unquestionable situation= TREASON AKA KILL ALL! <br />
<br />
Hell, if I were in the Horde, and I saw that as &quot;treason&quot;, I wouldn't instantly kill them. I'd lock em up, banish them, or ask for a fucking explanation before anything else.<br />

Maybe the last patch it will be indeed the old gods expansion but yeah who knows maybe they will do the end of WoD and Legion approach where at the end of BfA we get a entry raid for the old gods kinda like an intro then the next expansion is entirely focus on the old gods/void lords stuff.</div></div><hr />

I think 9.0 will be either &quot;Black Empire&quot; or Scourge 2.0. Imo more likely is Scourge, I can't see any class that would fit Old Gods expac, since we already have Shadow Priest. <br />
<br />
Also it would be cool if N'zoth would get proper build up (and some victories) over next few expansions, BfA should end with total defeat (decimation of Horde and Ally armies).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anduin has no backstory? He has been around since I started playing in WOTLK. He had a decent story arc in MOP.

I agree with you but Anduin tbh during vanilla, TBC and Wotlk was just in the background doing nothing special at all. It was until pre Cataclysm the shattering novel Christie started to give him some developments and stuff.</div></div><hr />

Granted, Sylvanas looks like it's basically a retelling of her WC3 campaign, but after everything so far Blizzard still hasn't conveyed her moral ambiguity, so maybe this will finally give us a reason to root for her.<br />
<br />
Jaina is more important to the war effort in Kul Tiras, anyway, at least presently, and we could use clarification on what she's been up to.<br />
<br />
Azshara is obviously there for the foreshadowing of 8.1+.<br />
<br />
Plus, I think they're obviously going for a certain theme here, three dangerous women shaped by war.</div></div><hr />

Jaina went from a pacifist to genocidal ideation.<br />
Azshara was forced into a pact with an old God that left her a monster.<br />
Sylvanas has been raised from the dead, forced to act against her will and then after regaining her freedom has turned into what she claimed to loath.<br />

That seems pretty varying levels of broken, even if they're still limping along.</div></div><hr />

Do you remember the ones for Warlords? The ones that set the different warlords out to be cool, full of personality and zeal, yet the game showed nothing of that? This is proberly gonna be the same thing again O.o<br />
<br />
I hate that they make these, because it hypes people up for some characters, who are not that deep in game and which only gets a shallow apperance compared to what the shorts show.... God, i hate this fake theatre of character bloating.<br />
<br />
Yeah Jaina, Sylvanas and Azshara are definitely &quot;not that deep in the game&quot;. <br />

Azshara, about time she gets screentime, one of the most fabled characters ever.<br />

Genn with his relations to Anduin (Father that lost son-Son that lost father). They used to create strong characters that lasts through the expansions (Arthas, Illidan etc.) even after their deaths/inprions/banish. Now it's a clearly fanservice and no more. Instead of good storytelling, you've become monster that cares nothing more but fr the profits. When you focused so much on profit - you're losing your playerbase -&gt; losing profits. Basically they took an ak and shot their legs</div></div><hr />

I guess, but you could also say that they were made &quot;warbringers&quot; instead of broken (Like Thrall, that literally became a broken man in Legion or maybe Saurfang with what have been happening -basically letting himself root in prison)</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's still a garbage and empty shell story wise compared to either of them. You're not gonna tell me his daddy died story and suddenly he's leading the alliance and all before that matches up to Sylvanas - Arthas story which was complex, dark and extremely rich in lore.<br />

The Azshara part is quite sad, especially if she's that strong, she should be the end tier boss and Nzoth should be the mythic only boss to follow it.</div></div><hr />

There's just no way they would ever make such a massive character as N'zoth, one of the few Old Gods on Azeroth, an exclusive boss available only to a percentage of the player base.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you mean like sinestra the only consort of deathwing to survive mating in his maddened form only available to heroic raiders (now mythic), or ra-den being only available to heroic (now mythic) quality players, or most recently illidan in demon form as part of the gul'dan encounter only available to mythic players, there's precedent for it and it's not something blizz are afraid to do but with the way things are now it's unlikely cos LFR hero mcgee over there will flood the forums whining about not being able to experience it all.</div></div><hr />

My friend, very few characters are deep in the game. Most characters in the game are glorified questgivers and does not act at all like they put them forward in short stories, novels and other media versions. This is what i mean will proberly happend with Sylvanas and Jaina, where they will proberly do a few active things in the first patch, but are then gonna be delegated to be faction statues for the rest of the expansion except the last patch, with us doing everything else in between and not seeing a fucking shadow of them.<br />
