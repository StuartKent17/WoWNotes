<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simca</div><div class="date">2019-02-06, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rekills aren't relevant in WF race and never have been. It's happened more than once in the past where the first guild got 2 kills before anyone else killed it once and nobody ever questioned the 'world second' guild status before this. That's not even mentioning how it would chain down the line - the top 100 kills would be almost entirely the same guilds on some of the harder end bosses. You might have 5 guilds out of the first 10 kills or something.<br />
<br />
If Method actually made a new guild and had their whole team join that new guild and then killed her, then it'd be technically relevant. I think some Method members joked about doing this but didn't actually do it in the end.</div></div><hr />

World third jokes aside, stop being so toxic. Limit helped tremendously this tier in pushing Method to push even harder for their World First so that's always a good thing for competition and for people observing said competition.</div></div><hr />

Anything for people with poor sportsmanship to try to degrade NA. It's tradition apparently. :) <br />

Obviously rekills don't count in the WF race. They never have before. It's just salt. :)</div></div><hr />

You mean, aside from the people posting here? The thousands of people watching Method's streams? The tens/hundreds of thousands of people following the WF race?<br />

Method.......bunch of punk asses. Seriously, who cares<br />
<br />
I loved to see a World First guild raiding. So I care. Thousands of people watched the streams so I guess they also care. <br />
<br />
The whole teenage thing with &quot;whatever..&quot;, &quot;who cares..&quot;, &quot;no one is bothered..&quot;, &quot;you're boring...&quot; is just pathetic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems this is a bit of a grey area Method didn't<br />
technically just do a reclear they had a different raid comp, it was not there original 'main' group, so in my mind they definitely did get 2nd aswell</div></div><hr />

Using ad hominem to try and refute someone's argument is a logical fallacy. But using ridicule to make the point that someone is being a dick isn't ad hominem.<br />

We all get that &quot;technically&quot; it's the 3rd kill. But what exactly is the point of such pedantry?<br />

100% correct wording would be:<br />

limits kill was:<br />
From Jaina POV: World 3rd kill of Jaina mythic encounter (because she actually was killed twice already before (both from Method))<br />
From Guild POV: World 2nd guild that was able to kill Jaina mythic</div></div><hr />

In that situation should we be counting every kill guild does and add those to the real ranks cause in that case a world rank guild 20 is actually a rank.... 40, or 50.<br />

As I interpret &quot;kill&quot; in this case is killing a boss for the first time in a raid. There are kills and rekills and you differentiate the two.</div></div><hr />

Just a question of time till not just europe will have more to offer...but China and India as well. Relax, if someone rises, someone has to fall...and that's most likely you. ;-)<br />

Uh.. no idea to be honest. I always disliked spending gold on heirloom upgrades. I had bought almost all heirlooms in Wrath/Cata besides the tank ones but upgrades for gold? Nah. Using timewalking currec always seemed the better option has I had a fuckton of those :D</div></div><hr />

Since the first time the 2nd guild got beaten by a rekill ? Not really method's fault if Limit is that bad...</div></div><hr />

<br />
So why in previous tiers theres no Method few times in ranking when they killed boss multiple times before other guilds? Also in Uldir? Does this apply only to second place? If yes, why?</div></div><hr />

Cause like any sports/race nobody gives a fuck about who's 17th ? You're new to real life ?</div></div><hr />

But again why before it was never like that and now should be. Be more specific.</div></div><hr />
