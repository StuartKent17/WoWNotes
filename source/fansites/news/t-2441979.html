Blizzard Collectible Pins<br />
The Series 5 pin packs will feature one of 10 new character designs: D.Va, Reaper, McCree, Zarya, Jaina Proudmoore, Saurfang, Mecha Tyrael, Ghost Kerrigan, Crusader, and Ava. Each character has a sculpted gold variant, meaning there’s a total of 20 new pins to collect.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
No time for trading? We’re introducing the complete Blizzard Series 5 Pin Set. This limited-edition box set features one of every standard Series 5 pin (sculpted gold pins not included), along with a Prime Evil Diablo Merchy pin exclusive to the Pin Set.<br />
<br />

Blizzard Badges<br />
Did you visit us at BlizzCon last year? You may want to save some luggage space for your BlizzCon backpack, because the official Blizzard badges are back! <br />
<br />
You’ll find the following new designs in the Series 2 Badge Packs.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
This year, the Capsule Toy Machines in the Darkmoon Faire are becoming Capsule Badge Machines! Same machines; same prizes; new badges to collect.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
What if you don’t have the backpack from last year? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. BlizzCon Badge Starter Kits and a new Blizzard Badge Snapback Hat will be available for new and returning collectors.<br />
<br />
Also, if you make a purchase at the Darkmoon Faire and you’ll receive this exclusive new badge.<br />

<br />
<br />
Trading Time<br />
You’ve got pins. You’ve got badges. It’s time to trade! <br />
<br />
We’ve expanded the open trading area in the Darkmoon Faire into a Blizzard Bazaar of tables, barrels, and helpful “blue shirts” to assist attendees in trading any Blizzard collectibles.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pin and Badge Trading Booth<br />
Last year’s Pin Trading Booth is doing double duty this year. On one side of the booth, you can queue for pin trading, with badge trading being featured on the other side.<br />
<br />
Rules for the Pin and Badge Trading Booth:<br />
<br />
<br />
Collectors can trade up to two different badges/pins at a time.<br />
Trades are one badge/pin for one badge/pin, respectively.<br />
A gold pin can only be traded for another gold pin.<br />
The pin board will accept any Series 5 pins.<br />
The badge board will accept Series 2 Badge Pack badges and Capsule Toy Badges.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A Trip Through the Timeways<br />
The Timewalkers’ Trading Post returns to the Darkmoon Faire, and its enigmatic proprietors have procured a brand-new item: the Timewalkers’ Treasure Chest, a mystery box full of items from BlizzCons past and present. <br />
<br />
Good luck, have fun, and we’ll see you at BlizzCon!<br />

I mean of course Blizzcon has changed in focus. It's not 2005 anymore. Some people love doing this pin stuff. I've heard those people are slightly crazy, but that's fine. Blizz want their money as much as they want anyone else's.<br />
<br />
AS for the lore, c'mon my guy. WoW's lore has always been a mess, because at Blizzard it's &quot;gameplay first&quot;. The point of WoW is not to tell a story. It's to deliver you a supply of loot.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lawlhero</div><div class="date">2018-10-21, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">xD I guess the rumors that no matter what they post people will complain is true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pin trading is extremely popular at conventions. PAX really kicked off the craze.<br />
<br />
I'm not really surprised if you're not familiar with it, but it has become a pretty big hobby amongst people who do the convention circuit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hobbies are a wide arrange of things. <br />
<br />
It is incredibly stupid to decline collecting as a hobby.</div></div><hr />

I just tried attempting their preview system and looks like their website preview of your character doesn't recognize even WoD stuff. All my characters there onward are nudies.</div></div><hr />

Last I heard they haven't been able to process orders properly since last year and they don't support WoD models, Allied races or 3D objects on armor. They also seem to get confused on which armor set you're wearing. My main is wearing the Mythic chosen set, but their preview shows the normal one sans all the 3D assets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah. Good times.<br />
<br />
remember when blizz wasnt a greedy giant multi billion dollar company, without autogenerating gear, scenarios and island expeditions, simplified classes, easier made balancing and so called QoL changes that are used to lower development costs? remenber before they started prioritize quarter numbers, share holder revenues and profit profit profit ? from a blizzard managers point of view: bad times :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm with this 100%. They really doubled-down on them, as well. Pitiful.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Yeah it doesn't look like they've been updated in a really long time. I actually have one, it's ok quality for back then but I think you could do much more detail with a 3D printer now. It's made of this odd kind of sandy material, would probably be much cheaper to use plastic. I bought a fully posable 3D robot for about $20 on etsy.<br />
<br />
And edit - I like the pins, as someone said pin collecting and trading is a big thing, I used to do it sometimes at Disneyland. Unfortunately I don't have any interest in Overwatch or Hearthstone so that's like... most of the pins. I have a Malfurion pin I got a couple years ago that I love.</div></div><hr />
