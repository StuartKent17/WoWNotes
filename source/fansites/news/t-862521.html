<br />
Firelands raid will not be in Patch 4.1 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2198-Firelands-raid-will-not-be-in-Patch-4.1)<br />
<br />
<br />
By now you’ve seen that the redesigned Heroic five-player dungeon versions of Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub are on the PTR, featuring all-new boss mechanics, updated epic-level loot, and some rare mounts for players to try to tame.<br />
<br />
You may be asking, &quot;where's Firelands?”<br />
<br />
Our goal with each major patch release, and especially with each expansion, is to learn from the past and use that knowledge to improve the game as we move forward. One of our biggest regrets in the pacing of Wrath of the Lich King was the Crusaders' Coliseum. The Trial of the Champion 10- and 25-player raid was released while many raiders were still busy with Ulduar, which meant a premature end to Ulduar raiding -- and a lot of players didn't get a chance to experience all of Ulduar's content during the normal expansion progression.<br />
<br />
Having learned that lesson in pacing from Wrath of the Lich King, we don’t feel Cataclysm needs a new raid tier just yet. We’re close, though, and Firelands will be part of patch 4.2, which is expected to hit the PTR very soon after 4.1 goes live.<br />
<br />
One of our long-standing development goals has been to release more regular content updates for you to enjoy. Our plan is to package features like raids, dungeons, and daily quest hubs into smaller content updates and release them as soon as possible, rather than wait and release them as large but infrequent updates. Our first significant step in this direction will be Cataclysm patch 4.1, and we hope the rest of our content updates moving forward follow this model.<br />
<br />
This new flexible approach to updates allows us to release content like Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub so that you'll have more challenges to overcome while we make the flames of Sulfuron even fierier and this second showdown with the Firelord even more climactic.<br />
<br />
While we know that some raiders feel prepared to smack down the Firelord once again, releasing an epic raid dungeon before its time would, in the words of Ragnaros himself, be &quot;too soon!&quot;<br />
<br />
If firelands isn't being released why are people finding all of this content?<br />
<br />
A good amount of development progress had already been made on Firelands by the time we decided it would be better to release it in the following patch. Because of that, a lot of information about what is now considered 4.2 content was already in the game files for the initial 4.1 PTR build. This just reinforces what Bashiok said about 4.2 being scheduled for release on the PTR shortly after 4.1 goes live.<br />
<br />
Development for both patches is currently well in progress. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, i just don't trust it'll be a short break. If Blizz is serious, I'd love them to commit to having 4.1 or whatever this ZA/ZG patch will be called out within 3 weeks, since it is two dungeons and a daily quest hub. If Blizz is serious about giving us smaller bits of content, that's fine, but I want it tested and out the door faster then.</div></div><hr />

So I guess 1.12 was... which tier?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterHamster</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm frankly amazed that people complain about this. Like, think back.<br />
Wrath of the Lich King progressed too fast, had too many separate lockouts, some people got geared in a couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
Now, Blizzard is trying to mix WotLK with Vanilla. Everything isn't served on a plate, but is more available anyway. The only reason raids lasted so long in vanilla wasn't mainly due to &quot;difficulty&quot;, it was because of what was needed of a guild in order to progress. Resistance gear, endless faction grinds, no real items outside of raids. You could get a couple of suitable epics if you spent a couple hundred hours farming mobs. Getting exalted with Argent Dawn, ah what a pleasure. 40 people needed the Onyxia Scale Cloak just for BWL. Attunements everywhere. Even when Naxx had been out for a while, you'd still start in Stratholme and LBRS. Level 57 blues.<br />
<br />
If you think Blizzard is stretching out current raids, do consider the guilds who did MC for a year and a half.<br />
<br />
Oh, how fun it was.</div></div><hr />

Gonna be at least 4.4 until we see Deathwing, with this more consistant patching it may be 4.5</div></div><hr />

Not to beat a dead horse, but Rift is looking more and more appealing to people each and every day. By no means am i saying Rift will beat wow, but people are migrating there. They believe people are shitting themselves over ZA and ZG commin back, but to what i have seen, most people arent. Even if most people arent ready for Firelands, we would still like the option, right? Its only 2 dungeons to hold us over for god knows how long, may be 1 month, may be 4. But still, i would like to see Firelands be open just to show that they are attempting to put out major content. <br />
<br />
Like has been said before, alot of individual raids with different themes would be nice, but i cant see them doing this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not how it worked in Vanilla at all though. Maraudon was a 1.X.0 patch, for example. Certainly not a raid, nor remotely important.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archermit</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While it is nice to see that they made raid content challenging enough to stop to many farming 12/12, 4.1 brings with it 2 5 man dungeons that drop 353 gear, this will open teh door for a lot more people to get into the raids since some of the earlier bosses will be more or less nerfed since those people will now have gear that is 7 item levels higher than what the bosses require. <br />
<br />
On the plus side at least now my guild has a chance to maybe try to get some HC kills since we plan on getting al'ikir and nef down in the next 2 weeks. must kinda suck for those people. Well at least they didnt add a icc buff to BoT / BWD to get more people clearing it before fire lands</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that's pretty much my opinion. If this means more content in smaller chunks, i'll take that. I just don't want Wrath-like content dispersal - 6 months between raids, nothing significant in between.</div></div><hr />

More frequent patches seems to be in the opposite direction, aka the direction they've been going in for the last 7-8 months which has netted us a lot of issues.</div></div><hr />

What? That's what they learned from ToC? No. People were burnt out on Ulduar then, and ToC was a failure of a raid in a box which included bad art, thus nobody was happy. What happened to blizzard?

<br />
I am pretty sure they have the numerical data to back up and refute any silly idea you think you have about the game. There were still a vast majority of guilds working on clearing all of the hardmodes in Ulduar, unlocking Algalon and finishing their first Val'nyr. We finished our Val'nyr maybe 5 weeks after ToC was released... and the gating of ToC, was that really needed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with this. I know most people weren't done with Ulduar (think my guild killed Yogg 0 Watchers 2nd week into Toc Normal - and we were around 150ish worldwide back then) when Toc came out and so didn't get to fully experience all the really fun hardmodes how they should have been done. I know not everyone has the time to raid 5 times a week and many of those who do need a little longer to achieve the same results as those who progress quicker. That is all well and good. <br />
<br />
However like the guy I quoted, I think there does need to be a line in the sand somewhere. If the time between 4.0 and 4.1 (if it comes out in a few weeks time, say 4 weeks) and the time between 4.1 and 4.2 are the same then that would be completely stupid considering the lack of real endgame content in 4.1. I am sure? / hope this won't be the case but we shall see.<br />
<br />
My guild is currently at 11/13 hc and there are a lot of others also in the same kinda area, another 4-5 months of the opening tier or more? No thankyou.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rennadrel</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 04:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So this basically means 4.1 will probably go live end of this month or early April and 4.2 will probably drop in June or July. A 6 month period between raid tiers I think should be sufficient, and at the rate guilds are starting to go with heroic progression, you will start seeing more guilds wind up 13/13 in the next couple of months. I see people who are struggling with a fight like Nefarian or Cho'gall, and they really aren't hard on normal, the tuning level especially as you progress and obtain more gear, is a joke for 25 man raids in my opinion. Doing hard modes now though, some of the encounters are tuned pretty well and are fairly difficult for the average raider. Having managed 2 heroic mode boss kills this week, I'd say that once you know the strategies and the mechanics, it's all a matter of putting it all together and getting flawless kills. If the Firelands raid does not drop until June, that would be fine I think, as the average guild is still somewhere around 4/13 in heroic content.<br />
<br />
But, on the same token, what's the point in adding these new dungeons in now? It does nothing for the dedicated raider, pretty much everyone who is clearing each instance every week has their 4 set tier and a lot already have off set items, hell Valor BoE items have significantly dropped in price. No point in releasing new content if players don't need to run it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xtki</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like this. Pacing was a major problem in wotlk. The first year of wotlk had 3 tiers of content, with a significant part of it being spent on naxx and ToC. They were both pretty underwhelming considering naxx was way undertuned and ToC only had 5 bosses (Onyxia was just a loot pinata) The second year had 1 tier of content (ICC) which went on for FAR too long. I'm glad that they're trying to spread things out better this time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiro</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 04:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am pretty sure they have the numerical data to back up and refute any silly idea you think you have about the game. There were still a vast majority of guilds working on clearing all of the hardmodes in Ulduar, unlocking Algalon and finishing their first Val'nyr. We finished our Val'nyr maybe 5 weeks after ToC was released... and the gating of ToC, was that really needed?<br />
<br />
Hardmodes and legendaries are optional, not a measuring stick to how people are going through the content. Once people get 12/12, the majority of lore is finished for that segment, and thus the story must go on. Legendaries and &quot;heroic items&quot; bring nothing to the table to extend content, they are optional bragging rights. So think to yourself about calling someone silly before you come out and look the fool yourself.<br />
<br />
If you want to throw out numbers, look how many people didn't finish ICC, let alone hardmodes there, hell, didn't do vanilla raids... guess we should be trodging through that yet too. Blizzard is trying to cheap out here, they're falling behind because they've allotted too much resources to their other franchises, thus they're stalling. We were supposed to get content FASTER. Their definition of faster is now &quot;part of the patch now, throttled segment of raid later, a lil more yet, a lil more&quot; all in said time. I'm curious to see if they'll get the content as a whole out in time tables compared to before.<br />
<br />
Take the blinders off sheeple, i've never seen such blind love, and it's deteriorating the quality of the game all around. I was a &quot;sheeple&quot; at one time, I didn't see what was happening during TBC until late of that segment. Going into Wrath I didn't have a blind eye and began to see their shift away from quality and caring about their consumer. That's what happens when people never call them out, it's like someone staying with somebody who cheated on them because they're afraid that they don't know anything else anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, nice work indeed. Keep in mind during ICC people had the same train of thought that you're applauding, and THATs a large part of the reason it took forever to get new content. It's absolutely stunning to me that people still can't see this...</div></div><hr />

My guild isnt even 12/12 normal 10man yet (we just re-structured our core group) and with a new raid coming out so soon feels like we would be missing alot, like Heroic modes and acheivments. Im actually really happy blizzard, good work :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
This would be my biggest concern. With the new raid tier it would mean even those who don't need gear would run the new dungeons for the valor points, but as it is we are still going to be looking at useless valor points since they will be gone come 4.2. I'm not finished with this tier by any means, but I'm still to the point of rarely running any daily heroics and don't usually max out my points each week anymore. I'll probably run the new dungeons a couple times because they are new, but then will be quickly back to having no point until 4.2 when valor points become useful again. I'm afraid the popularity of them will drop very quickly, as in within days, and that is very sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because not everyone is a serious raider? It seems pretty obvious to me. Our guild is already bored silly. We aren't really geared enough to raid; we are the kind of guild who does not really raid to raid, we raid for a easy enjoyable experience. Not the 'hey lets spend 10x wiping on this boss'. We are really hoping for the valor to JP conversion so we can actually start raiding. But i guess that's another 3 months off. No problem. 3 months of Rift is fine.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ogemaniac</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Expansions come about every 18 months, with three major raid patches each. The proper spacing, in my opinion, should be 6 months for the opening tier, followed by 4 months for the remaining three. The first tier should last longer, obviously, because it contains leveling and heroic sub-tiers, which I think Blizzard did a much better job of this time than in WotLK. I like to take my time leveling, and see most of the leveling zones and dungeons WHILE LEVELING, rather than filling it all in after I hit max level on boring Saturday nights. Even in cata, I still felt we leveled a little too fast. TBC was better.<br />
<br />
And when I hit max level, I like having what feels like a full half-tier or so of heroics/rep/crafted gear that I need to obtain before I go to the first raid. This is fun, and chews up a month. Only then should we go raiding, with about for months until new raids are released. Having smaller patches interspersed with the raid patches, dealing with quest hubs, 5mans, and 1-boss raids, are also cool.<br />
<br />
WotLK was kind of a failure in my opinion. Level 80 came too fast, and I had three Naxx epics within four hours of dinging 80. The whole heroic/rep/crafted portion of the game was essentially skippable, and turned into more late-Saturday-night backfill.</div></div><hr />

Not to beat a dead horse, but Rift is looking more and more appealing to people each and every day. By no means am i saying Rift will beat wow, but people are migrating there. They believe people are shitting themselves over ZA and ZG commin back, but to what i have seen, most people arent. Even if most people arent ready for Firelands, we would still like the option, right? Its only 2 dungeons to hold us over for god knows how long, may be 1 month, may be 4. But still, i would like to see Firelands be open just to show that they are attempting to put out major content. <br />
<br />
Like has been said before, alot of individual raids with different themes would be nice, but i cant see them doing this.<br />
<br />
Nice post ;)<br />
I'm a RIFT convert and I'm not going to say one is better than the other, but the reason RIFT is 'good' is because it's new and while it borrows ideas from WoW, Warhammer Online, EQ, LotRO, etc, it's fresh. I'm not worried about end game yet and it may suck but I know if I went back to WoW in patch 4.4 it will still be the same.<br />
<br />
Yes Deathwing may of shattered Azeroth and I appreciate the devs spent years working on it but it still old Azeroth and more than ever this xpac feels like 'Grindaclysm' and to rehash ZG and ZA was kinda the last straw for me.<br />
With the way things are shaping up I'm guessing the next xpac will be that Illidian hasn't really died and we get to fight him in some new form and the xpac after that Bolvar does go nuts and we revisit Northrend.<br />
You need fresh new ideas and your setting yourself up to showcase an old game, with some 'spit and polish on old content.<br />
<br />
That's my 2c enjoy it with a grain of salt :confused:<br />

Wastey :D</div></div><hr />

This is just sheer laziness all around honestly, what a hobbled shell of a company anymore... Sucks as this game used to get the vast majority of my free time. Now on the other hand, I'm playing more games since I'm playing only twice a week in WoW now because the content is beat.<br />

Thanks blizzard fanboys for allowing the game to end up the way it has now by patting them on the back for every time they mess up or screw the fanbase over. You are responsible for this, and I hope you're happy... :(<br />
<br />
It's funny how true raiders' opinions change to the needed one to QQ correctly. For the last 1½ all I've heard was that 3.2 came too early and it sucked that Ulduar only lasted 4 months. Now it's the other way round?<br />

BiS /= &quot;done&quot;. Same boss, more HP, new ability aka HM, is still the same boss overall, and thus /= done. 12/12 = done though, like it or not. We've been done now for a couple weeks, people are not signing on anymore to do heroics, we're all bored and having a blast playing Rift. 4.1 maybe will be done in a month, maybe. Firelands won't be done for 2-3months after 4.1. Blizzard is failing here, and starving us of our content. What happened to &quot;new content faster?!&quot;. Probably right next to the player housing, new animations, and dances. Thanks sheeple, thanks a lot for ruining my favorite game.<br />

Nope, it's not the other way around quit making stuff up, maybe that was the sheeple once again talking &quot;if&quot; anyone said that. If anything, it meant the quality of Ulduar v. ToC. No need to defend blizz here, they're big boys now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not 12/12. I am only halfway through this raid tier and I admit that I am already bored. Guildies are no longer even logging in to the game if it not raid time. I am burned out on Tol Barad dailies. I have two 85s and I can't yet bring myself to level up my other 80s because 80-85 is so mind-numbingly linear. It was awesome the first trip, ok the 2nd trip, but I tried it on a 3rd alt and he quickly got shelved. I hope in time I can revisit my 80s.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm feels flat. WotLK had major issues, but even in Wrath I didn't get bored so quickly. I don't know if it is Cataclysm or it is the fact that Azeroth has been around for over 6 years now.<br />
<br />
I'd fully support monthly (or every 2 months) patches that added one dungeon or new daily quest hub or anything to help keep things fresh.</div></div><hr />

If that's actually true that's unacceptable, I follow the simple rule that any period longer than 6 months after a major content patch (and no 2 5-mans is NOT a major content patch, it's slightly less than Ruby Sanctum). Admitedly I'm not even done the normals yet, (partially because we lost 60% of our raiding division and weather crushed us a fair bit as well) and I am getting bored of normal mode content (I've never considered heroic modes the same fight).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anybody who is completely ready/geared for a new raiding tier needs to find something else to do with their life. They especially need to separate raiding tiers since they cheaped out and took out half of the gearing opportunities by being lazy and sharing 10 and 25-man raid lockouts. Not to mention that with the harder transitions from regular dungeons to heroic dungeons then raids it has certainly slowed down some of the less obsessed players from needlessly rushing through content.</div></div><hr />

It was either a dungeon(Mara, DM) / raid(ZG, BWL, AQ20+40, Naxx) or a new system(pvp, Battlegrounds, Xrealm BGs).<br />
In Wrath blizz implemented a new major patch every 6 months. It was allways a raid+75% of the times new dungeon(s).<br />
<br />
Now its gonna be: 4 months for 2 dungeons.<br />
2 more months for a raid instance.<br />
<br />
Seems to me its still the same amount of content.</div></div><hr />

If they are coming back to their old ideals as in Vanilla and they are finally getting around to it, then I welcome it gladly, vanilla has hmm 12 content patches released before TBC? Correct me if I'm wrong but 12 patches of content are better than 3-4 (TBC &amp; WOTLK major patches). <br />
<br />
So they are bringing ZA and ZG in this content patch and since they are being tested already, they should be out within 3-4 weeks easily, any info we find on Firelands or elsewhere is what is already being worked on but won't be out yet. If they keep this model and PTR of 4.2 on realms in 1-2 weeks time, release of Firelands would be less than 2 months since all they would need to do is finish up what they need to put in, test and do any class balences. This also means classes can be addressed a lot sooner than before (which is good).<br />
<br />
In reality guys, we could be seeing a lot more dungeons etc before we see Deathwing, and 4.3 will not be Deathwing now and he could be faced anywhere. I'm sure no one wants to farm him for up to a year before the next expansion, I see this as good news. As a personal note, this allows me personally to hopefully get to Sinestra before Firelands and do something else in-game like trying to get new mounts of achievements or something to keep me happy instead logging in 3 days a week to raid and being on max 1 hour a day between.</div></div><hr />

Wrath of the Lich King progressed too fast, had too many separate lockouts, some people got geared in a couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
Now, Blizzard is trying to mix WotLK with Vanilla. Everything isn't served on a plate, but is more available anyway. The only reason raids lasted so long in vanilla wasn't mainly due to &quot;difficulty&quot;, it was because of what was needed of a guild in order to progress. Resistance gear, endless faction grinds, no real items outside of raids. You could get a couple of suitable epics if you spent a couple hundred hours farming mobs. Getting exalted with Argent Dawn, ah what a pleasure. 40 people needed the Onyxia Scale Cloak just for BWL. Attunements everywhere. Even when Naxx had been out for a while, you'd still start in Stratholme and LBRS. Level 57 blues.<br />
<br />
If you think Blizzard is stretching out current raids, do consider the guilds who did MC for a year and a half.<br />
<br />
Oh, how fun it was.<br />
<br />
Epics were Epics in vanilla... there is not such &quot;no real itens outside of raids&quot;, ZG for example gave you mostly blues. Blues were what 359 epics are today.<br />
<br />
They could wait a lot more before releasing new stuff because the raids were really harder. Not only by itself, but also because the game were way less friendly that it's now (no &quot;kill skull target&quot; anyone + 40 ppl?). Of course, all the other reasons you've stated with that (resistance gear, attunements...).<br />

They were killing themselves to let all the content on PTR &quot;too soon&quot;, lol. Now they can keep with the 6 month cycle, but not letting the &quot;rushers&quot; (players who clear everything in a week or too, sometimes thanks to beta/PTR) go away.<br />

What? That's what they learned from ToC? No. People were burnt out on Ulduar then, and ToC was a failure of a raid in a box which included bad art, thus nobody was happy. What happened to blizzard? It's like they just don't care anymore. This is just sheer laziness all around honestly, what a hobbled shell of a company anymore... Sucks as this game used to get the vast majority of my free time. Now on the other hand, I'm playing more games since I'm playing only twice a week in WoW now because the content is beat.<br />
<br />
Thanks blizzard fanboys for allowing the game to end up the way it has now by patting them on the back for every time they mess up or screw the fanbase over. You are responsible for this, and I hope you're happy... :(<br />

Nope, it's not the other way around quit making stuff up, maybe that was the sheeple once again talking &quot;if&quot; anyone said that. If anything, it meant the quality of Ulduar v. ToC. No need to defend blizz here, they're big boys now.<br />
<br />
Just because you can't do hardmodes (so, 12/13 for you, since there is a extra boss, so no content finished for you), does'nt mean that it's all done. Sorry. You're having a blast with Rift because it's more easy content for you.<br />
<br />
And sorry, again, nobody really care if you're leaving to play Rift. Good/Bad for you. Nobody will try to &quot;change your mind to make you stay&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. It came out six months after Wrath of the Lich King came out. That was indeed 3.1<br />
<br />
Guess how many months it's been since Cataclysm came out before they started patch 4.1 testing?<br />
<br />
3.<br />
<br />
December, January, February. It's not even half the time it took for 3.1 yet people are complaining as if we've been waiting for years.<br />
<br />
Unless math suddenly became broken as heck, I'm pretty sure there's a massive amount of exaggeration here, mostly due to personal disappointment, not facts.<br />
<br />
The Math breaks when 3.1 ppl were really tired of killing EVERYTHING since 1st week of WotLK launch and now they're tired of killing Magmaw and a few others for 3 months instead of 13/13 alread. So their math says that it's alread time for some new easy bosses to compensate the lack of 13/13 alread like it was in WotLK (yes, i'm putting Sarth3D in the same place as Sinestra, I shouldn't, but it's easier to compare this way, lol).</div></div><hr />

The Trial of the Champion 10- and 25-player raid was released while many raiders were still busy with Ulduar, which meant a premature end to Ulduar raiding<br />
<br />
IIRC Coliseum released with gating system and limited attempts in heroic mode. Guild raiding Ulduar were still going back even after release of Coliseum. I though they will regret that place, troll raid in Zul'Drak or Nerubian empire would be much more cooler raid then this crap they made.</div></div><hr />

If 4.1 will take 2 more months and then another 2-3 months for 4.2 even my raid-2-days-a-week group will have all hardmodes done.<br />
<br />
Although it's nice to have a bit more time, 4 months will be too long I think. Even 3 will be pushing it a bit.<br />
<br />
If you're at 4/13 hard modes you're in the top 5% or so of the player base. <br />
<br />
Look at wowprogress. Remember it measures only guilds that are &quot;raiding,&quot; that is they've killed at least one raid boss. That's not even the entire player base. <br />
<br />
17% of guilds have killed Nefarian in 10 or 25 normal, 25% on Al-Akir, and 33% chogall. <br />
<br />
The highest heroic mode kill is Halfus, with only 14%, most heroic below that? the next highest heroic kill is Chimeron at 8%, and then Maloriak at 4%.<br />
<br />
Although I agree to a certain extent that Blizz is probably waiting for something that won't happen. Most of the players that haven't seen end-game content by this point won't have a lot more progress this tier.</div></div><hr />

However I dont understand why it has to be called 4.1, couldnt it just simply be 4.0.9 or something? As said before I definitaly agree about WoW not needing a new raid tier so soon but I dont feel it is justified to have 4.1 that doesnt bring much and then immediately 4.2 bringing us a raid.

Think about this and read this carefully please.<br />
<br />
Its not too soon, doesnt matter where you are in progression. Your guild could be 1/13 and it still wouldnt be to soon. More content is better, regardless of how far 99% of the player base is, that will just give them even more to do.<br />
<br />
So, lets say your main &quot;point&quot; is that then people wont see all the content we have now!! Aka they just go where the better loot is and they dont really care for the &quot;content&quot; anyway. People like that can just replace the word content with loot and be done with it. Nothing is stopping you from still doing all the old content. Lets say your guild stops you, or that would be an issue for allot of players, here is a very simple solution. BLIZZARD PUTS IN A QUEST TO KILL NEFARIAN BEFORE YOU CAN ENTER THE NEXT RAID, when they have their decent number they seem to want that have done the content, remove the attunement. <br />
<br />
Thing is guys, with this, who loses? The casual players dont lose, cause they are still progressing, maybe they even have more inspiration to clear the current content faster, making them progress at a decent pace. The hardcore guilds get new content too, which everyone will see later. I just do not see a downside. <br />
<br />
Now this is purely speculation, but its solid speculation: Blizzard, a multi billion $ company cant even finish enough content for their player base and they are pushing stuff back. The blue post almost confirms it, just in a sneaky way, giving people some content and making it sound &quot;better&quot;. They are dropping the ball, that blue post was like a fluff piece.<br />
<br />
They knew the news will split the community into a hardcore/casual debate where one side keeps flaming the other, dropping our focus from the real problem, blizzard themselves.<br />
<br />
Think about this, with my suggestion, does anyone actually lose out on content? Does it negatively effect any part of the player base?</div></div><hr />

Blizzard finally learned their lesson from TBC and WotLK. Naxx, Ulduar and TOC were out for 4-5 months when Blizzard released the next tier. That meant that ICC lasted an entire year. Sunwell lasted for 8-9 months. There's no reason to rush the first few content patches out and have the final content patch last too long.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sillinoob</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you just say sunwell lasted 8-9 months?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anjerith</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Putting out content before enough of the playerbase has seen current content is damaging to the game. Look at Sunwell, look at Ulduar. In both of those cases only a very small percentage of the playerbase saw the content at lvl, in both cases those raids were followed by what was largely considered inferior content that was released simply to please those larger, less hardcore players.<br />
<br />
It is much better, both from a game developer and player perspective, to filter the content like this *because* it gives more people time to appreciate content. The idea that raids should just be pushed out of Blizzards ass asap is the same sort of thinking that gave us naxx-redux and ToC.

<br />
Keep the official wow forums style posts over on their forums please. You don't know me, nor my guild, who has all of our drakes and bane title. So just like that your opinion is void and null.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, Putting out content before enough of the playerbase has seen current content is damaging to the game. Look at Sunwell, look at Ulduar. In both of those cases only a very small percentage of the playerbase saw the content at lvl, in both cases those raids were followed by what was largely considered inferior content that was released simply to please those larger, less hardcore players.<br />
<br />
It is much better, both from a game developer and player perspective, to filter the content like this *because* it gives more people time to appreciate content. The idea that raids should just be pushed out of Blizzards ass asap is the same sort of thinking that gave us naxx-redux and ToC. It is the philosophy of quantity over quality and it is damning in a grander scheme of time than the instant gratificationist has the power to understand.<br />
<br />
Please. Just stagger the gear so you have to gear up from the current normal raids before you can enter the new raid, then shortly after, allow the points vendors to sell T11. That way people will still have to do the old content before they move on. If they fail to clear and gear, then they have to wait longer to enter. Period.<br />
<br />
And no, blizzard was doing ToC from the get go knowing how they were going to approach it. It was a poor quality raid because they didn't put effort into it, that's it and that's all. Quality is up to blizzard, not &quot;pressure from the fans&quot;.<br />
<br />
Please people, please take the blinders off before this game is totally destroyed. I put far too much effort and &quot;had&quot; far too much fun with it. Please don't ruin the game for me, and many others.</div></div><hr />

My guild's a pretty good one, we're still half way through the heroic modes with plenty of grinding face left to go. If Firelands were released today, chances are we wouldn't be back to do the remaining heroics until they became comparatively trivial, which would be a real shame. The fact that only 36 guilds (at time of writing) are 13/13 suggests that there's still some life in this tier. I liked the vanilla styles of patching; small - medium sized patches regularly with some content, rather than big ones every half a year.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc64ba3314e0</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, seems some &quot;people&quot; are really missing the point here.<br />
Think about this and read this carefully please.<br />
<br />
Its not too soon, doesnt matter where you are in progression. Your guild could be 1/13 and it still wouldnt be to soon. More content is better, regardless of how far 99% of the player base is, that will just give them even more to do.<br />
<br />
So, lets say your main &quot;point&quot; is that then people wont see all the content we have now!! Aka they just go where the better loot is and they dont really care for the &quot;content&quot; anyway. People like that can just replace the word content with loot and be done with it. Nothing is stopping you from still doing all the old content. Lets say your guild stops you, or that would be an issue for allot of players, here is a very simple solution. BLIZZARD PUTS IN A QUEST TO KILL NEFARIAN BEFORE YOU CAN ENTER THE NEXT RAID, when they have their decent number they seem to want that have done the content, remove the attunement. <br />
<br />
Thing is guys, with this, who loses? The casual players dont lose, cause they are still progressing, maybe they even have more inspiration to clear the current content faster, making them progress at a decent pace. The hardcore guilds get new content too, which everyone will see later. I just do not see a downside. <br />
<br />
Now this is purely speculation, but its solid speculation: Blizzard, a multi billion $ company cant even finish enough content for their player base and they are pushing stuff back. The blue post almost confirms it, just in a sneaky way, giving people some content and making it sound &quot;better&quot;. They are dropping the ball, that blue post was like a fluff piece.<br />
<br />
They knew the news will split the community into a hardcore/casual debate where one side keeps flaming the other, dropping our focus from the real problem, blizzard themselves.<br />
<br />
Think about this, with my suggestion, does anyone actually lose out on content? Does it negatively effect any part of the player base?<br />
<br />
BLIZZARD PUTS IN A QUEST TO KILL NEFARIAN BEFORE YOU CAN ENTER THE NEXT RAID, when they have their decent number they seem to want that have done the content, remove the attunement. &gt;&gt; I totally agree. So no one can skip it and after a few month, say atleast 2, they need to simply remove the restrictions. Everyone is happy - the hardcore player base which enjoys the content and the casual player base that they can see the content even without killing endbosses.<br />
<br />
I liked the idea of BC, where u HAD to go trough maggi,gruul &gt; ssc &gt; fds &gt; hyal &gt; BT. Even tanks had to farm resi gear for ssc (hydross was the boss). Newerdays u don´t need such resistence anymore, got a totem, buff whatever and thats it.<br />
<br />
Don´t know why they don´t do it again, was fun to play and by far enough content for all... this playerbase shit is only an excuse for them to say, hey we get enough money out of it, you still play the game even if we through out only 1 Tier content a year... (what means 1 raidinstance for normal) i mean wtf.. with all that money u could bring 3 Tiers of raidcontent a year, and no ONE would say AHHH thats to much.. we are not done with the first tier... just go like it was in Burning Crusade and all would be fine...<br />
<br />
And to Gearup new players, simply let them get through justice points or &quot;new&quot; 5man Instances the prev raidcontent gearlevel. <br />
F.e: U get released 3 Tier Contents. After 4 Month - 2/3 new Dungeons. After 4 Month - 2/3 new Dungeons, etc etc. So the playerbase can even simply equip new players trough them. Or alts or whatever they do.<br />
<br />
Like now with ZA/ZG ilvl 353, its simply shows that u can get trough that geared for firelands...nHC raids.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sillinoob</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeh exactly, the big downside of TBC was when you recruited new players they hadda go through all the old content to gear up and get attuned again. <br />
Easy way to stop that from happening is to make the attunement requirement only temporary, that would fix everything.<br />
<br />
But yeh, i cannot see how anyone in the right minds wants to say no to more content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
while ill need more time to finish 12/12, and proly will do 10/12 only, i dont see how ZG+ZA constitute for new content... its just an excuse to delay firelands. <br />
<br />
lets just say 4.1 is balancing patch, not content one.</div></div><hr />

People say that there was low content with the release of Cataclysm... Have you even seen the changes made 1-60? 80-85 and endgame raiding ISN'T the whole game, although I guess it is for some folks... Guess what, you don't pay Blizzard's paycheck.<br />
<br />
Here's a really simple thought:<br />
<br />
If you want new content the second you're done with the old, PLAY ANOTHER GAME. Even if Blizzard pushed new content every freaking week, some people who can play 24-7 wouldn't have enough to keep them busy.<br />
<br />
It's not like you can't resubscribe when the new content comes out. Play Rift, play Old Republic, play Monkey Island, who cares. If you're such an avid gamer that you can clear everything you care about in the game faster than 95% of everyone else, then don't put the onus on the game company to keep you occupied. Take a step back and choose who you give your time to. Because it's not even about money, with all the free games there are out there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meteos</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm my thoughts on Blizzard has changed quite a bit with this decision. I'm just glad they are learning from their past mistakes in releasing content. Wrath was just a mess with it from Ulduar to Toc, it just didn't seem right and then ICC for pretty close to a year. Even in BC with releasing almost everything except BT all at once and only giving out a new 10 man then Sunwell. I imagine from here on out the expansions as well as content will be better progressed.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocabe77c30e6</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion it would have been great to roll this out as a current tier 11 dungeon which is slightly more difficult than the existing ones. This new lockout system restricts raiding much more than Wrath did and we need more content sooner rather than later, without the need to forever keep gearing up.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spotnick</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with Ulduar was not that ToC was released too soon, it's that ToC should have been the same tier as ulduar.<br />
<br />
Gear was better so people stopped doing Ulduar hard modes. if you make the hard mode gear from previous tier better than the new tier of the curent regular raid, people won't stop doing the old one.<br />
<br />
Plus Firelands is supposed to be 7 bosses only.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Up to 7 months until new content? Really? Listen, i'm sorry, but blizzard can't, and SHOULDN'T cater to those players who are extreme-casuals that only get to play a very limited amount of time a week, nor those who just can't coordinate enough to get kills. I'm not talking HM kills neither. I'm talking about johnny casual who posts here &quot;good news about them learning! I'm planning on hitting 85 next week and then start gearing up through dungeons and then heroics, then get the raids done&quot;. Those people should never-ever be taken into account for. That said, I don't think that as soon as all HMs are down by a guild that new content is on the way. 4months TOPS for a new raid, period. This will help keep the game fresh, keep the PVPers happy as well, and actually more people will be happy in the end. It's not like they can't go back to old content to check it out.<br />
<br />
If blizzard thinks I'm going to fall for their tricks again, I'm not. Subscription is up in the next few weeks, it WON'T be renewed, I'll put that to RIFT instead. I'm not waiting 4 more months for new content, something we should be getting next month instead. (insert sheeple rage &quot;go on, we won't miss you&quot;). <br />
<br />
I'm still just bewildered that people are so freakin' blind when it comes to blizzard. I always though apple fanboys were the worst, but it's clear that blizzard fanboys are easily the worse, throwing logic out the window, getting bent over all the time, and helping blizzard ruin the game for the other players calling them out by supporting them. Pathetic.</div></div><hr />

All the whiner are like kids<br />
You are SOOooooo used to get candy every same moment that when you receive a NOoooooo you started to whine , cry and roll on the floor like a kids ..<br />
<br />
The point of that is to update content more often than before ...<br />
<br />
I personally think this is a good ideas <br />
If the patch was call 4.0.8 would all of you whine ??? no <br />
The remake of ZA and ZG gonna have new boss and new ability so it`s not basically the same thing<br />
It`s the same place yeahh but not the same encounter ...<br />
<br />
So Deal with it</div></div><hr />

Not to beat a dead horse, but Rift is looking more and more appealing to people each and every day. By no means am i saying Rift will beat wow, but people are migrating there. They believe people are shitting themselves over ZA and ZG commin back, but to what i have seen, most people arent. Even if most people arent ready for Firelands, we would still like the option, right? Its only 2 dungeons to hold us over for god knows how long, may be 1 month, may be 4. But still, i would like to see Firelands be open just to show that they are attempting to put out major content. <br />
<br />
Like has been said before, alot of individual raids with different themes would be nice, but i cant see them doing this.<br />
<br />
Just lie lotro, Warhammer, AOC, Aion and the beat goes on. People leave but the majority return and there is a reason. This is the best mmo out there period like it or not. YOu complain about content and yet Blizzard gives more content than any other mmo /sigh.</div></div><hr />
