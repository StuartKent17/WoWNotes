From what we can currently glean, the Horde helps Princess Talanji and Zul escape from the Stockades, but once they get back to Zandalar, Rastakhan and Zul reach some sort of disagreement (which I assume is the Zandalari allying themselves with the Horde) and a civil war between their respective followers begins.<br />
<br />
But you do have a point... No reason we shouldn't gut him right there and then for all that BS in patches 4.1 and 5.2.</div></div><hr />

Is that a statue of Arthas along with his grave?<br />
<br />
No... i sure hope not...<br />
Putting a flag of the silver hand on his grave would anger any paladin.<br />
<br />
Daelin is more likely; albeit i doubt he was an actual paladin of the silver hand.<br />

Yeah, he did have new ones in Legion. I wonder why they chose to change them again? The Legion ones fit his new model perfectly..</div></div><hr />

My only complaint is that there are too many forsaken in it, I'd also prefer if the Innkeeper was Darkspear. Somehow the look of so many rotting corpses in this glorious place is imo ruining the feel of it :/<br />

A few observation:<br />
<br />
-i want this Boralus kind of darkness implemented in every friggin zone when its night time! <br />
(oh and pls get rid of the sharp shadows on the ground at night aswell)<br />
<br />
-who are these half-giant people in the city? Oo<br />
<br />
-the anchor symbol is not overused enough! i bet you can shove in much more if you really try! multiply it by 3,4 at least! :P</div></div><hr />

At last some culture for the Horde, that fits in with the Horde.<br />
(Weeb Elves dont count)<br />
<br />
So on one side we got: <br />
Filthy hobo pirates, emo landscape, giant fat humans with constipated faces, and the awesome dark irons to save the day.<br />
<br />
While on the other side we got: <br />
Ancient stuff, freakin Aztecs!, blood trolls, and straight-back orcs. <br />

shit i cant decide what i'm gonna play first.</div></div><hr />

The placement of houses on the left side of one of the canals in the screenshot basically shows a flat area with the same house model being placed all over said area. The houses are simply facing different directions; think this was very, very lazy on Blizzard's part. They've shown they're capable of building intriguing pathways with Suramar.<br />

The Zandalari look fine to me. They're as tall as male night elves and are much more muscular/corpusculent than the trolls we currently have available.</div></div><hr />

You forget this is alpha, and they are likely a placeholder for some brand new model. It's a little early to be complaining about stuff like that when it's probably going to look different next week lol.</div></div><hr />

Gotta love the crowd trying to turn &quot;Pandaria vibes&quot; into a negative, when what they're ACTUALLY refering to is 5.2's Zandalari Troll (not Pandaria Mogu) architecture, just with an altered color palette.<br />
<br />
5.2 being the best patch this game has ever seen in my book, I'll take Zandalari &quot;vibes&quot;, thanks.</div></div><hr />

I actually prefer how the Alliance hub looks. The bright golden look, coupled with probably voodoo/witch music, will give me a headache after a few months.<br />
<br />
The Kul Tiras capital actually looks like a grounded fantasy city. Makes me wanna roll a rogue alt and hang around in it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: That Poorly Fed Horse looks pretty buff!</div></div><hr />
