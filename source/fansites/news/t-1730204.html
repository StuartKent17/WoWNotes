6.1 and Monk transmog set from the salvage yard is still broken. Gloves and shoulders can't be used for transmog. Frustrating.<br />
This is the intended functionality for those items as they are &quot;invisible&quot;. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/570402419164602369))<br />
<br />
Seriously, , why change the way the coffee and mining picks worked? Now I'm getting 0 picks, have coffee coming out of my ears<br />
You can obtain a permanent mining speed bonus from a treasure in Spires, and the coffee buff now stacks! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/570719613031313408))<br />
<br />
Can't use my Chauffeured Chopper on my brand new Panda Monk the tool tip says &quot;you are not the right faction for this mount&quot;<br />
Mounts (code-wise) don't support a non-faction, and these mounts are also visually faction-specific. Unlikely to be changed. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/570726624825446400))<br />

why make it so wins in the main event in ashran don't give conquest? alliance can't win side events so now it's impossible<br />
The two factions were avoiding each other in Ashran. We are altering rewards to encourage competition. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/570669277277241346))<br />
how about making a continent wide buff to encourage PvP in ashran<br />
thanks we're on it (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/570679620925825024))<br />

&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/march/hearthstoneIcon.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:-2px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom&quot; /&gt; GDC 2015 - How Blizzard's Warcraft Brought Hearthstone to Life<br />
Gamespot (http://www.gamespot.com/videos/how-blizzard-s-warcraft-brought-hearthstone-to-lif/2300-6423661/) has a nice video of the talk Blizzard gave about creating the Hearthstone UI. Some of the highlights are below:<br />
<br />
Early Concepts<br />
<br />
The initial game that got approved was Warcraft Legends, with a build called Fire and Ice.<br />
One concept had players traveling across the world doing single player quests and content.<br />
The game was initially created entirely in Flash.<br />
The pre-alpha board was complicated and looked boring.<br />
Other ideas that came up were an Adventure Book, 3D Cards, Hologram Cards, a board that was a tree stump <br />
The initial matchmaking screen had an over the top hero selection animation with sound effects, hero voice emotes, and ending with a &quot;Fight&quot; sound. <br />
The next itteration had a box that opened to a map of the world. You then selected your hero, the map ripped in half to reveal a Google Earth like video of Azeorth, zooming in while showing names of players battling. Once your match was found, both player names were displayed and the somewhat familiar Hearthstone board appeared.<br />
The box still exists in a more polished form in the live game. Treys and keys are used in the UI to go along with the box theme.<br />
The box had to sit somewhere, so the team decided it was sitting on a table in a tavern, which you can see in different loading and other screens.<br />
The same idea was fully realized for Blizzcon, with a very nice Hearthstone tavern stage set.<br />
<br />
<br />
Physical UI<br />
<br />
The UI started with a flat parchment style UI, then they decided it should be more 3D. Next they made it more physical, added magic, added some charm, and then made it feel valuable and constructed. <br />
The current trend is building flat UIs, which didn't fit Hearthstone. The team went for a more physical UI, as it fit the game better.<br />
The physical UI made things like keys, card backs, and card packs feel more valuable. <br />
Opening a pack of cards is an important part of the experience. The team tried to replicate the physical experience of opening a card pack with the game's sounds and visuals.<br />
Many parts of the UI bounce or rotate, giving them a more physical feel.<br />
The physical UI worked out well when the team decided to bring the game to mobile devices. The UI already had a lot of nice elements for touch, such as the cards tilting when you moved them around and clicking the board causing dust to fly up.<br />
The game has a lot of over the shoulder appeal, which is important for a collectable card game. Someone walking by and seeing you play it will be interested.<br />
The physical UI is hard to expand. Currently the screen has nine hero slots, but how can it be rearranged for more.<br />
It took a long time and a lot of tries to get the UI right, but it was important because that is a huge part of the game. <br />
The physical UI also is designed for flavor over efficiency, to a certain extent. <br />
<br />
<br />
UI Importance<br />
<br />
Some games come up with mechanics and gameplay and then treat the UI as an afterthought. The Hearthstone team realized that the UI design was as important as the game design. <br />
If the UI was too complicated, it was a signal to design that things may be too complicated. <br />
The board could only fit 7 minions as designed, so rather than scaling them down the team capped it at 7.<br />
Decks were initially 60 cards, with the list on the right scrolling down over three pages. It was too much for new players to keep in their head.<br />
An older concept allowed for chains, where your opponent could play a card, you could play a card in response to that card, and so on. This was a mess visually and complicated to design and play, so it was removed.<br />
The team starts with a feature by some simple wireframing, then iterates on it in 2D until it feels right, and then brings in 3D to make sure it will work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q&amp;A<br />
<br />
There are no plans to allow modification of Hearthstone like addons allow in WoW.<br />
There is a UI group that meets and the other teams are taking note of how the physical UI worked well.<br />
No effects are sacrificed for the mobile versions of Hearthstone, they just optimize them so performance is acceptable.<br />
Hearthstone on phones is pretty far along and looks awesome, so expect to hear more in the next couple of months.<br />
The need for more deck slots is a known issue that is under discussion. <br />

He is still on the pandaren starting turtle mining and picking herbs to level. He hasn't rdf'd or left the turtle to go out into draenor.

How he did that with only 75 herb/39 mining? I know that now we can pick our heirlooms from a screen instead of a mail (and maybe armory is bugged and do not show that he has the 2/2 version that goes to 100), wich helps since we can't get mail until we choose a faction and leaves the place (and armory shows that he got all those heirlooms last week, only one week with it to help do the job???)... <br />
<br />
But how did he get to 100 with gray mobs, 75herb/39mining? Do we have pet battles there (can't remember)???</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mining and herbing (with 75/39) give EXP ALL the way up to 100. It's just damn slow, and he only has the nodes on the turtle to pick from. That's why this is such an achievement. I'm assuming the herbing is 39 because he probably has to drop it and relearn it every time he maxes it out to keep the nodes from turning green/grey and giving less EXP.</div></div><hr />

Regardless, Blizzard just needs to give us the ability to toggle the appearance of shoulders/gloves/boots already.<br />
<br />
Kind of can't believe someone is actually complaining about the coffee/pick change. It is an amazing change and I love it. They items stacked to 5 before, and now you can have up to 20. They also had a 2 min CD, which made it a pain to stack coffee buffs. It was also buggy - the coffee effect stacked on 2 of my characters, but did not on the rest for whatever reason. Now it stacks on everyone with no issue. And now the treasure pick effect stacks and gives practically instant-cast mining, which is great. I regret that I deleted it on my main like 2 days into the expansion. I've tried to go item restore it from the site, but it was too long ago. At least I still have it on one of my alts.<br />
Also, I wonder if that person who has &quot;coffee up to their ears&quot; knows that the coffee effect stacks. Because by using 3 each day I find myself barely maintaining enough coffee for the next day. But if I was only using 1, then I would have a surplus too. They probably aren't taking advantage of the super buff.</div></div><hr />

The primary purpose of the sets is transmogging. They look like the sets from the character creation screen, which are otherwise unobtainable (for most classes). And they weren't 610 in the beginning, but only 483. So yeah, introducting transmog sets that can't be used for transmog is rather stupid (even though I understand the reasoning).</div></div><hr />

Honestly, I wish they would. It would be nice to actually be playable on the Kindle Fire. (Check the reviews for the Hearthstone app on Amazon.) I don't need all the whizzes and bangs. I'm no stranger to text-based games (like MUDs) so I don't see a reason to not make a version of Hearthstone like that - beyond not having the &quot;Blizzard&quot; style. I suppose that's enough of a reason itself if you're looking to attract people in the mobile app eco-system who have never heard of Blizzard Entertainment or don't have experience with Blizzard's properties.<br />
<br />
But I'm already a long-time customer, it'd be nice to have the option. If I'm on my desktop computer, I'm either working or playing WoW or spending an inordinate amount of time cooing at pictures of cats and kittens on the world wide web... not playing Hearthstone. Hearthstone is something I'd really only play on one of my mobile devices, but I can't since there's such a resource load from all the bells and whistles.<br />
<br />
I guess Blizzard is okay with that because they're already making loads of money from Hearthstone. They won't miss me.</div></div><hr />

It's beyond idiotic. It's a waste of development time and effort, so someone with severe OCD on the dev team can relax. &quot;Completion&quot; is a fucking idiotic reason to award things that can't be used, take up space for no reason, and have literally no purpose in the game. It's decisions like this that make me hold contempt for whoever is in charge of things over there - the lead dev over this should have said &quot;No, that's fucking stupid, make it useable, or don't bother.&quot;<br />

I would more likely to question armory, as it shows 0 statistics from other characters in Classic, BC, Cata, Panda raids/dungeons, but shows a loads of WotLK achievemnts and statistics, i guess it's just screwed.</div></div><hr />

No mailbox on panda island though is there? I can't remember since I only did it once to get the panda pet :p</div></div><hr />

Did Blizzard change the way sending mail works? It was my understanding you can't send mail to a neutral character. If that's still the case, Doubleagent could not have gotten the non-heirloom BOAs to boost his item level. <br />
<br />
It clearly states he isn't Horde or Alliance, so obviously he's still neutral. I'm just curious about how he got his item level higher than the items available on the island. And if he has the higher item level BOAs, why isn't he using them?</div></div><hr />

You don't need mailboxes to get Heirloom gear anymore. There is a tab like there is for pets and mounts now.</div></div><hr />
