Ability Squish<br />
We do feel that, at least for some classes, there are a few too many buttons to keep on your action bars. It's an issue we'd ultimately like to solve, but something we have to be very, very careful with.<br />
<br />
It's easy to look at your bar, go &quot;LOOKIT ALL DEM BUTTONS&quot;, and decide that some of them need to go. In fact, we agree. It's much more difficult -- even dangerous -- to decide exactly which abilities to get rid of. Generally speaking, if you have an ability keybound, it's probably at least fairly important to your class. Getting rid of abilities you don't have bound doesn't really fix anything, so that means that, in most cases, we're talking about cutting the important ones.<br />
<br />
That's not to say it can't (or won't) be done, but it does mean it's a fairly large task. Depending on the ability, there could be a lot of rebalancing or restructuring needed to make sure the class is still functional and fun to play. Again, it's something we'd like to do, it's just a very involved process.<br />
<br />
Something you didn't really touch on is how some abilities exist as flavour for the class. The last time this kind of ability trimming occurred, a lot of things we players took for fun and playing about wound up biting the bullet because they were seen as &quot;unnecessary&quot; (i.e. Hunter's Eyes of the Beast). <br />
True, and we want to avoid that. As I mentioned above, removing abilities you don't often use doesn't accomplish much. We often talk about this issue in terms of action bar space, but it's really keybind space that's the problem. One could make an argument that, say, Unending Breath could stand to be cut, but that's not something that's going to free up a keybind for the vast majority of Warlocks. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/281862-i-am-absolutely-begging-for-an-ability-squish/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10673937505?page=5#94))<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4.2 Warrior Changes<br />
We don't feel that Warrior damage output itself is the issue. It's strong, but not out of line compared to other classes. We think the issue lies with mobility, and the Warrior's ability to keep that constant pressure going. That's why we decided to revert the 5.4 Intervene change in 5.4.2 and move the root break back to Safeguard. Once we've had a chance to see how that affects things, we'll be able to decide if any further changes are necessary. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/281844-what-hasnt-warrior-damage-been-nerfed/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10672967231?page=4#64))<br />

Reputation / Questing<br />
Why not take the leap into mounted combat using the tech from quests like The Drakkensryd from back in Wrath?<br />
It would take months of work to feel decent and not hacked in like it was in the (overall awesome) Drakkenryd quest. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403952433182695424))<br />
<br />
Dailies are a grind because being able to use your class is not really a challenge anymore to ANYONE.<br />
I agree that's a problem when you start to overgear the content. Say Isle of Thunder at its launch still had challenging mobs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402548132644261888))<br />
<br />
With the success of the Warlock Green Fire quest chain, are you planning to add quest chains for other classes?<br />
If and when it makes sense. We like the feature overall but don't want it to become formulaic. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403951705634533376))<br />
<br />
Technically questing is trivial. It's not hard and everyone can do it. It's simply a time sink until raiding.<br />
We could make WoW a game only about raiding. I don't think it would be as popular though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403610252920115202))<br />
You know, the &quot;heart and soul&quot; thingie which is played by 5% of your players.<br />
I don't know where that number comes from. Raiding is very popular. But that doesn't mean all players raid. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403638644931428352))<br />
<br />
Not the same as saying &quot;okay but make it trivial for alts&quot;. Just reduce the restrictions since we've already done it all once.<br />
Why? Why is being able to click quest objects without fighting anything a better design than just skipping questing altogether? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403637597685051392))<br />
<br />
Yet at max lvl, we won't be questing (no dailies at max lvl), so no real change from current flying design decision<br />
You will be out in the world doing stuff, more like Timeless Isle than Golden Lotus. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403606941240262656))<br />
But pls give to that T. Isle 2.0. some structure. Killing 2k Yaungols without the pacing/reward that a daily gave is boring.<br />
Yeah, it won't just be Timeless Isle 2.0. That's just an example of content that isn't just &quot;Kill 10 mogu every day.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403633384842215424))<br />
<br />
in WOD will we see more shared mob tagging outside of groups. Really like that in other games. Allow more impromptu grouping<br />
We'd like to improve our tagging rules for sure. Not convinced dot everything to get credit on all is the right design. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403604039591395328))</div></div><hr />

My main was a rogue (I was a hardcore progression raider) during WotLK. I quit for Cata and came back for MoP and all of a sudden I was overwhelmed by buttons... Crimson Tempest, Shadow Blades, all the new stealthed abilities, Smoke Bomb, mut spec adding Rupture to the rotation, Dispatch, making Shiv a more important keybind... and probably much more. Even just the fact that there are like 400 finishers baffles me. Having Envenom, Kidney Shot, Slice and Dice, Rupture, and Crimson Tempest on my bars is really too much on top of everything else.... Rogues aren't the worst class when it comes to ability bloat, but they're certainly &quot;up there&quot; when it comes to important abilities that NEED to be easily accessed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are they kidding...? Since my WoW began stuttering with patch 5.4.1 I've been spending a LOT of time in GW2 now that I can play it at 60 fps thanks to upgraded comp, and that &quot;dot Everything to get credit on all&quot; is working pretty well I'd say...people are not afraid of losing cred, or wasting time fighting a mob they won't get cred for. Timeless Isle has tons of examples where people will run past fellow players in need if that player is fighting (and losing) against a mob that doesn't have shared tag. <br />
<br />
Just get over the old and conflict-causing mechanics already, make it good for players to cooperate and come to the rescue...and yes, as sad as it may be, they won't go out of their way to do that unless they know they get something for it. <br />

Ability Squish is easy to do. I have no idea why blizzard makes such a huge deal about it. Just scale back some of the buttons they have put in over the last two expansions. Do it gradually, take away some buttons from pvp. One Button or 2 Buttons. Then if it works do it for pve. Simple.<br />
<br />
So in your mind, it doesn't also include rebalancing since the game has been balanced for some time around all abilities...?<br />
<br />
It's easy in theory (which is all you got) but there's a bit more to it than just removing buttons from our ability journals.</div></div><hr />

So you would be okay with me dotting up every mob on timeless isle while you guys finish them off and getting just as much credit for it? Those people who run past others who are fighting a mob right now would just tag them and move on. That is far from helping eachother. <br />
Also who is still solo grinding on timeless isle? In a 5 man group you get at least 5x the coins and rep.<br />
<br />
My game was also stuttering after that patch. It was because of an addon, in my case MoveAnything iirc. Did you try turning off your addons yet?<br />
It started stuttering everytime I started doing damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am hoping the change to 20 man ´mythic´ mode can help with this. Like they said, they can now assume that every class is represented, which means there will be a lot less need to give the same ability to 4 different classes. I think a lot of the bloat with abilities is where they felt they needed to add important abilities to more than one class.</div></div><hr />

I never wanted it to be anything but a raid. Scenarios are fucking horrible and most of the time quite stupid.<br />

How does it fail to get trolled by Blizzard and you actually fell for it?<br />
<br />
They didnt troll me and I never fell for anything. I never 100% expect anything from this, but IMHO scenarios are fucking horrible and turning one of the most popular raids of all time into one is just plain out stupid on their end. Especially if this is a pre-launch event...they have a chance to do some amazing things with Kara right now......but turning it into a scenario is utter failure.<br />

Probably not. It's not a new server, it's just an over lay of the existing Kharazan, most likely just phasing.<br />
<br />
If the new name is in fact the final name it will be a scenario.</div></div><hr />

Uh, sir... The NAME is the troll, most likely it was renamed that because of the previous data-mine of that and Blizzard felt the need to mess with us. It is NOT a scenario, all it is so far is a phase. A scenario would involve having its own actual &quot;Map&quot;, but this is just a layout for a existing map, not a new one. Its likely that this won't be a scenario, and it being a phase would make sense in the context of it being a pre-expansion event, which is what mostly everything points towards it being.<br />

I hope Inquisition is one of the first paladin abilities to go. Something that is required for maximal DPS, is not instant cast, and has to be refreshed (now) every 60 seconds? What's the point? Fold it into something else, make it passive, make it baseline, or remove it.<br />
<br />
I hope they don't get rid of it, in my opinion. I already feel as if my rotation is boring and Inquisition is one of the few things that make playing Ret feel unique, I almost prefer when it expired faster, more to do. Then again, considering my feelings on that I guess I am not really the target audience for the ability squish...</div></div><hr />

I quit playing my hunter because they are no longer fun. I actually enjoying feeding my pet to keep him happy, using eye's of the beast in bgs to scope out the flag rooms, to volley just because it looked cool. I hope they aren't doing more of those types of changes, because even though every player might not use said spell, that doesn't mean it doesn't add something fun. Just my opinion, I'm sure others have different feelings. I think reducing the amount of spells would make the game to easy, and thus not as fun. The complexity of the game is just right.</div></div><hr />

Actually, you may be onto something. In addition to WoW's 10th anniversary being in 2014 (which hey, since they haven't done anything for the last several years, perhaps they're laying the groundwork for this in advance?), that year will also be the 20th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise.<br />

You're right. How dare they make Arms PVE viable! The nerve! <br />
Sub-human warrior players shouldn't be allowed to raid unless they tank or go Fury!<br />

That's what you believe, right?</div></div><hr />
