The full Three Sisters comic has been released (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/story/comic/windrunner-three-sisters)! <br />
After returning home to Azeroth, Alleria Windrunner calls upon her estranged siblings—Sylvanas, the warchief of the Horde, and Vereesa, ranger-general of the Silver Covenant—to join her in a quest to retake their ancestral home, Windrunner Spire, from the undead who have overrun the place. On their journey, the three sisters will navigate both the dangers of the present and the ghosts of the past to discover if time and tragedy have divided them irrevocably—or if, despite everything, they are still a family.<br />

Really do hope we won't go through another Siege, or a variation thereof... But don't see Sylvanas coming out well by the end.</div></div><hr />

That common Lovecraftian quote, &quot;Even Death may die&quot;.<br />
<br />
The whispers are always shouting that Sylvanas serves the true enemy, that she seeks to end all possibilities, and they need to kill her before she kills them. The true enemy that the Void is referring to is clear. Death. The Void is trying to fuck with Death, likely intending to kill Death so to speak.</div></div><hr />

The Void is fucking terrified of Sylvanas and sees her as a servant of &quot;the true enemy.&quot; That suggests that Sylvanas may after all have a greater and more important role to play in the war against the Void.<br />
<br />
As to the art, the inking and coloring at least is nice. The backgrounds look to be screenshots that have been drawn over in photoshop (even using the default leaf brushes). The character art itself is okay, but the faces sometimes look weird and the expressions seem incongruent with their personalities and dialogue.</div></div><hr />

In a world where blizzards story writers where actually intelligent probably, unfortunately the bit to take away here is Sylvanas is so evil she plans to kill her sisters raise them as undead and make them her servants. Or basically WoW Garrosh 2.0 continues as planned, at this point I'm guessing the obvious path to take is Sylvanas kills Turaylon, Alleria goes full void and kills her then becomes the next big bad for a future expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which i'm really hoping they dont do, but with the way things are playing out so far that's could be where things are headed. <br />
<br />
Fanservice or not Sylvanas is one of the more interesting characters storywise Horde has left, Gallywix is boring because all he cares about is money, I would say Saurfang but blizz decided to have him leave the horde (I miss my orcish uncle iroh!), Baine is kinda just there, he's not a bad character, he's just kinda there, not even sure who's leading the darkspears at this point Rokhan? which really only leaves Sylvanas with any screentime development since blizz seems to enjoy making us fight and kill characters we have grown up with/ leveled beside like Nazgrim and Garrosh and that's pretty much where Sylvanas is heading unless she gets some crazy redemption thing in BFA before we switch gears and start hunting old golds again.<br />
<br />
Really hope they can come up with something better than Garrosh 2.0.</div></div><hr />

Frankly i think we will end up killing both the void-sister and sylvanas at some point.<br />

It is clear that the void-sister is slowly losing her grip on the void while sylvanas has long lost herself to the craze of undeath.</div></div><hr />

And lorewise... yeah, if Sylvanas wants to just kill her sister just because there's no defending there. She's just flat out evil right now... I mean she hadn't seen Alleria in like a decade and she was still going to off her because reasons.<br />

More like there were two lies. She does not miss being alive, and she is planning to betray her sisters. The only truth was her being proud of being warchief.</div></div><hr />

Not that she didn't have a point regardins Vereesa fucking up everything, but she went to the reunion with thr intent of having her sisters assassinated and now we are supposed to see her in a positive light cause she didn't. Yet. &quot;Imma gonna kill my sisters later&quot;. Oh, what a nice person.<br />
<br />
It was also nice that she didn't want to play by the rules of the game she suggested. Granted the punchline was probably intended to be: &quot;I lied about not betraying you&quot; as the arrows flew, but still. I used to like her as a character and I like the new Trisfal and Silverpine forest. But now I'm starting to hope she does die and we can finally forget about the mess she has become.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taeldorian</div><div class="date">2018-06-05, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it was really good. There’s a clear enemy of the void which is Death, something that wasn’t really thought of before (most people focused on light vs void). So it’s interesting to see the void have such a big fear of death. <br />
<br />
Secondly, while the faces were really derpy I think the lore the comic provided makes up for that. Sylvanas is giving off some major lich king vibes and Death is set up as a new huge enemy for the void. Light vs void vs death is pretty interesting.</div></div><hr />

Those aren't the proportions of a child. They're completely screwed up and look like awkward hobbits.<br />
<br />
Vereesa's face is also a bit screwed up I'd say, her eyes are...I'm not sure if it's a bit too close, or the fact that she has like, an egghead that's throwing it off.<br />
<br />
The story was interesting, and for a free comic I guess you can't expect much, but it's not like you need a fine arts degree to judge this (Which, to be fair, I do have an art degree).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, I doubt that. I can't remember the exact statement, but from the preview of Before the Storm, where she speaks with Nathanos, one could conclude that she likes having an army to serve her goals, but highly dislikes all the political and &quot;honor bound&quot; liabilities she has to make, as a Warchief. I also highly doubt that, the way Sylvanas is portrayed lately, she even could feel something remotely similar to &quot;being proud&quot; of something.</div></div><hr />

I think Sylvanas sparing them was not a sign of humanity. She said she wanted them to cling to their &quot;sorrow-filled lives a bit longer.

She was planning to kill them. The dark rangers were waiting for her signal to attack Alleria and Vereesa. That was the reason Sylvanas wanted to have a reunion. She then said that Alliera and Vereesa will serve her in death, meaning she wants to turn them undead.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. After all, she's the undead with tears permanently stuck on her face.<br />

Still pretty fun comic overall, it was interesting seeing that Sylv would go as far as to almost kill her sisters. Her familiar ties should have been given a longer arc, but whatever, perhaps that's not the end of it. Vereesa being the thirdiest of wheels felt kind of funny:<br />

Second- it was fun to see the other &quot;comical&quot; side of Sylvannas, meaning even if she is dead she still has some &quot;sense of humor&quot; beyond of &quot;i could raise you Lor themar you would be a really atractive corpse&quot;<br />
Third- i hated the end, it loss all the &quot;lore&quot; implications about Sylvannas being the true enemy of the Void, and everything its focused on &quot;se was about to betray their sisters and turning them into Dark Rangers&quot; Lich queen all in the end will serve me, yarada yarada........Blizzard this was actually the last time to redeem in a &quot;sense&quot; way Sylvannas. <br />
<br />
Now to wait that big Warlord of Draenor end cinematic where sylvannas will be at the side of her sisters and say &quot;AZEROTH ITS FREE, WE ARE ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND WE FIGHT FOR THE LIGHT AND BLAH BLAH&quot; because you know, this is how Blizz and CGolden loves to redeem characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the way they wrote the story, it seems like the truth was that she misses being alive and she is proud to be the warchief. She was planning to betray her sisters and her &quot;signal&quot; she talks about was most likely when she would play the game and reveal the lie. She had a change of heart and instead told her sisters she didn't want to play anymore. <br />
<br />
I am probably reading too much into this, but Sylvanas seems to often be putting on an act to avoid dealing with how she truly feels. She has come to embrace the power undeath gives her, but she has always referred to her fate as a curse. I'm sure deep down she would love to be alive again, or at the very least rest in peace and not worry about an eternity of damnation.<br />
<br />
Another example was all the way back in BC. She has an emotional moment when her necklace is returned to her, and immediately goes full Banshee Queen to brush it off. She claims it means nothing, throws it away and sings the Lament of the Highborne, then picks it up once she is done. And now she has a moment of doubt and brushes it off by going full Lich King by claiming she will force her sisters to serve her in death. <br />
<br />
I imagine that she will ultimately either have an emotional breakthrough and try to redeem herself, or will double-down on the insanity and lose it all.</div></div><hr />

Really? Because in the very first page of the book she complains on how she dislikes it very much. <br />
<br />
As for comic - it was so bad and awkward at times it was hilarious. That dance scene, Alleria melting to Tyralyon's hand touch (&quot; wo much human potential!&quot;) Vereesa being jelly that Ally still has her human husband. <br />

It is for sure the two truths and a lie, that is the thing.<br />

because<br />
1. she told i sometimes miss being alive, she has said this in the past<br />

<br />
Now, Sylvanas is a bitch. I really hope we will kill her. <br />
<br />
But what we saw is that Alleria and Sylvanas are basically the same. The only sane one is Alleria. <br />
<br />
One is on the verge of being turned - which will surely happen soon - and the other has already fallen. <br />
<br />
Also Sylvanas is cute thinking she could have kill them that easily.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2018-06-05, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard's doing a lot of emphasis on the Windrunner sisters now. Seems to me it'll either go one of several ways:<br />
1.) Sylvanas dies but so do her sisters.<br />
2.) Sylvanas sacrifices herself to rescue one or both sisters. Maybe even one of her nephews.<br />
3.) The love of Alleria and Veressa save Sylvanas and pulls her back from the brink leading to her redemption.<br />
<br />
While it looks like Sylvanas is taking Garrosh's path, Sylvanas has something Garrosh didn't: family. Sylvanas has 2 sisters, 3 nephews, and technically Nathanos. That will likely play into her ultimate fate. Guess you could say she has Turalyon, too, but chances are he'd sooner run her through than hug her.<br />
<br />
But hey, it's Blizzard. She'll go crazy, try to murder everyone, be beyond redemption, ends up getting killed by the players, and we stick her head on a pike in Stormwind/Orgrimmar while Nathanas replaces her as the leader of the Forsaken.<br />
<br />
But also look at overarching stories. Garrosh's story led from TBC to WotLK to Cata to MoP which then led (and ended) in WoD. Gul'dan then became the thread between WoD and Legion. Now we have Sylvanas's arc in Legion leading into BfA. But what arc will lead to the expansion after? With the introduction of Bolvar's daughter in BfA, that suggests a connection to WotLK. Or rather a WotLK 2.0. Sylvanas's story as well as Jaina's would also lead back to that as would, in a way, Anduin's. Having the four stories converge would make sense. Sylvanas, barring she sees redemption in BfA's finale, could very well become the opposite of Bolvar. Sylvanas could become an undead creature that could use the void, arcane, and perhaps even the light (although not likely on that one) to combat the Scourge. If Sylvanas were to die in BfA, then Blizzard would potentially miss a very interesting plot element and she'd just go down as a female Garrosh.<br />
<br />
Begs the question if Blizzard would really just repeat the same story with different characters ... but since they like to repeat the same crap over and over in different ways (Sunwell T6, T9, WoD LFR tier, and now BfA &quot;tier&quot; being an example), I wouldn't be surprised to see Sylvanas just go nuts and have to be put down with no redemption.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flurryfang</div><div class="date">2018-06-05, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it just me or is there like a huge disconnect with how the sisters are portrayed(especially Sylvanas) and what text is written for them? O.o<br />
<br />
Like especially the last pages: Sylvanas does not look like a person, who is planning to take power and make servants, she is more giving the attitude of feeling warm emotions towards her sisters mixed with sadness. Its like the artist of the comic got told something different about the context of the scenes than what actually ended up being their lines.<br />
<br />
...... Finally, i am again feeling like Blizzard is forcing something on Sylvanas, that her character can not really take. Its like we see 2-3 different Sylvanas character in the comic, all given a few pages then switched around..... Its just messy and confusing. <br />
<br />
This comic was proberly made to make us understand the characters more, but to be honest, this only made things more confusing and up for debate. Sylvanas is both a merciful character, who let her sisters go when she could have killed them and ressed them, but she is also apperantly pure evil and planning to kill all. While 80% of the comic is pretty cool, the main character development is just wasted by going in multiple directions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In this case, she didnt do anything wrong. We're supposed to be ok with Alleria willingly giving in to a far more dangerous power and her open use of it, and Vareesa's lies and backstabbing, but oh no Sylvaanas did a banshee scream and pointed out her sisters bullshit. <br />
<br />

She probably sees their existences as torture, and turning them into undead would be setting them free of their sorrows. So she wants them to suffer a bit more first.<br />
<br />
Plus you don't get a fucking medal for not killing your siblings. Especially if the original plan was to having others do your dirty work.<br />

Using familial connections to make powerful oppositional forces less willing to fight IS her duty. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dr Assbandit</div><div class="date">2018-06-05, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Out of the 3 I thought the &quot;I would never betray you two&quot; would be the lie but she didn't give the signal so that might actually be the truth. She might have planned to but after seeing them I think she changed her mind but she is still beholden to death/undeath. Back in Warcrimes it was shown that she really did still care for Vareesa and was hurt at the end.<br />
<br />
I'm glad they at least added the parts about Vareesa and the one thing I usually hate about Golden's writing is her playing loosely with continuity. That being said I still can't seem to see her as a compelling character and it might as well have just been Alleria and Sylvanas in this comic.<br />
<br />
Lastly I knew Alleria would be hearing whispers but it was good to see that she was questioning the future of her relationship with Turalyon. That the lie was the Void is a gift was a nice touch and I get the feeling she is going to either fall to the Void, fall and get pulled back to sanity, or just constantly struggle but play a big role in the future.<br />
<br />
All in all I think the comic was somewhat decent but Golden is writing based off of story and lore direction given to her by Blizz so as others have noted I think they can't seem to make up their mind the direction Sylvanas should take. She seems like she suffers from dissassociative personality disorder and as it stands I think Blizz is making her irredeemably evil and eventually killed off. They already &quot;used up&quot; a redeemable story arc for Illidan and I sincerely doubt they will do the same for Sylvanas.<br />
<br />
This is just going to end in tragedy which kinda sucks since it seems forced.</div></div><hr />

Not because I think she is purely evil and whatnot but fuck those bitches... Alleria is a fucking hypocrite (oh no, you're a monster for being killed by some human potential fucker and having your soul sucked out of your body and then still managing to make the best out of that fucked up situation... oh yeah I willingly let myself get corrupted by a dark naaru, but it's okay coz I'm like, not completely crazy yet...) and Vereesa is just a coward that turned her back on her sister when she needed her.<br />
<br />
And yeah I think she didn't actually tell any lie there, not really. I mean at first it would seem that she would have betrayed them if not for that apology from Vereesa, and it might have actually been true, but I think she actually still genuinely cares for both of them and won't have the nerve to do it unless things really escalate (like say, they kill nathanos or something, or come directly for her during a conflict and it becomes a fight for survival).</div></div><hr />

Have a REAL conversation. Ugh.<br />
<br />
I wish they'd pick a direction with Sylvanas already as this reads like a plot twist narrative with her coming out as the misunderstood character. Alleria being the aggressor and Vereesa being the neutral party. <br />
<br />
One could make the argument that Sylvanas had her dark rangers for protection from the 2 in case of an assassination attempt. One could also say that though Sylvanas ends with her big scary villain line, she doesn't specifically say she's the one who is going to bring down her sisters, only that she plans to raise them when their paths eventually lead them to their own ruin (Alleria's void, Vereesa's abandonment of Sylvanas).<br />

I think that she will die in the beginning of BFA. I have my theory that the dying elf next to the Sylvanas in front of burning Teldrassil screenshot we have is actually Varseesa and that Sylvanas may actually pull out what she wanted from the beginning which is resurrecting her into the undead ranks. Now we will see what actually happens in regards to the burning of Teldrassil, because things might not be as what they appear to, we should not exclude that something or someone had set up Sylvanas as the culprit to burning of Teldrassil which acted as a catalyst for Alliance attacking Undercity, because after all, Sylvanas wanted to attack Stormwind and not Teldrassil...</div></div><hr />

That common Lovecraftian quote, &quot;Even Death may die&quot;.<br />
<br />
The whispers are always shouting that Sylvanas serves the true enemy, that she seeks to end all possibilities, and they need to kill her before she kills them. The true enemy that the Void is referring to is clear. Death. The Void is trying to fuck with Death, likely intending to kill Death so to speak.<br />
<br />
I got this impression as well. The comic, if the story it tells is reflected at all in-game, seems to be hinting at Sylvanas essentially being the new Illidan- the &quot;chosen one&quot; who is a major threat to the Void. They obviously fear her and want her eliminated, so we have to ask ourselves why.</div></div><hr />

She's not condemned based on her thoughts, but for actually preparing their assassination, as well the line of &quot;No Anya. I will let them cling to their sorrow-filled lives a little longer. In the end they will serve death, they will serve me&quot;. Which means that she did not stop out of the goodness of her heart, she's still planning on going through with it.<br />
<br />
In Warcrimes she invited Vereesa and her two sons (seen in the comic) to live with her in the Undercity, what Vereesa didn't know was that Sylvanas was planning on killing all three of them and raising them as undead. Sylvanas honestly believes they would want this, and that this would be the best thing for them, that's how fucking twisted your mind becomes when you're raised as Undead, you start to rationalize undeath as something good even if you hated it in life.<br />
<br />
Add to that how much she hated Arthas for turning her into a Banshee rather than giving her a clean death, it makes zero sense that she would want others to suffer the same fate she has.</div></div><hr />

In Sylvanas's eyes, how would bringing her sisters to undeath be betraying them?<br />

I think all three of Sylvanas' statements were lies. The non-betrayal obviously was, as she did even betray them in the game they were playing at the time - totally ignoring the Dark Ranger setup and all.<br />
<br />
So if she played by the rules - which she obviously did not - &quot;Proud of the Horde&quot; and &quot;Sometimes wish to still be alive&quot; would need to be true....reading the last panel i have an EXTREMELY hard time believing the latter to be true....and at that point it is just common sense that all three were lies.<br />
<br />
I'm obvioulsy with Saurfang on what being an &quot;Honorable member of the Horde&quot; is like...so i would call her liar on that one right from the start. But seeing how she plays the game just suggests she is lying in all three statements ignoring everything else except the comic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
She never betrayed them. It's implied the signal would have been her answering which of her 3 statements was a lie. Since all the Windrunner sisters aren't dead, she didn't betray them.<br />
<br />
Her being proud of the Horde probably isn't too hard to ascertain, why wouldn't she be proud. Showing her pride isn't in her character but why wouldn't she still be proud. And we know she laments not still being alive at times. But dwelling on the past isn't part of her character so she pushes it aside and you only get to see glimpses of it.<br />
<br />
Sylvanas didn't tell any lies, her not finishing the game thus the signal cemented her &quot;never betraying&quot; her sisters as a truth.</div></div><hr />

It's quite interesting. Vereesa apparently also doesn't know that Sylvanas had planned on killing her if she had stayed with her and to raise her into undeath. A plan she apparently wanted to repeat before changing her mind at the last moment. Sylvanas as a person seems to be deeply broken and to have a huge load of issues to deal with which make her volatile, erratic and highly dangerous. More so than even Alleria who's wrestling with the void. <br />
<br /> the Comic. It's interesting that the void seems to consider death or possibly something lurking behind death it's enemy. So far the &quot;void&quot; was shown as the antagonist beyond all. Yet here it is, being antagonized and infuriated by something, something it considers an actual enemy, a dangerous one. Something that from the voids view is &quot;worse&quot; than itself.</div></div><hr />

I will let them cling to their sorrow-filled lives a little longer. In the end they will serve death, they will serve me&quot;. Which means that she did not stop out of the goodness of her heart, she's still planning on going through with it.<br />
<br />
In Warcrimes she invited Vereesa and her two sons (seen in the comic) to live with her in the Undercity, what Vereesa didn't know was that Sylvanas was planning on killing all three of them and raising them as undead. Sylvanas honestly believes they would want this, and that this would be the best thing for them, that's how fucking twisted your mind becomes when you're raised as Undead, you start to rationalize undeath as something good even if you hated it in life.<br />
<br />
Add to that how much she hated Arthas for turning her into a Banshee rather than giving her a clean death, it makes zero sense that she would want others to suffer the same fate she has.<br />
<br />
She doesn't invite the sons at all. She basically tells Vereesa they are not going to be able to go to undercity which is the main reason Vereesa chickened out of the deal. Hell in War crimes she basically tells Vereesa that Undercity is no place for the living and she was still willing to go. It was when she was told she was going to be seperated from her children is when she changed her mind.</div></div><hr />

Art may be subjective but there's also a general consensus for what does and doesn't look good, and this comic is not up to par with it, hence why everyone is complaining. Honestly I expect much better of official Blizzard releases even if it is just a comic.<br />

You're correct, I apparently misremembered about her children. Not like it matters much though, she probably only wants them to reach adulthood before they are killed off as well so they can be more useful to her.</div></div><hr />

Step off your high horse for a minute. You're calling me arrogant, childish, spoiled and self-entitled when you speak like that, seriously?<br />
<br />
The fact that they are releasing it for free doesn't matter, they have a reputation to uphold and any time a company releases a product which does not live up to the quality that the playerbase have come to expect from them, that reputation takes a hit. I expect more from them because I know they can do much better than this, and I want them to continue to release better things than this. This is far below the standard that we have come to expect, and way worse than even much of the fan-art found on deviantart.</div></div><hr />

Didn't call you that, though I understand where I miscommunicated that fact. My words were more directed at those who were... well, I explain it in my reply to the other guy later down the line.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to counter your point, and I do apologize if I state some obvious fact here or there but I want to be sure I cover my all my bases.<br />
<br />
There is a finite amount of time, resources, and talent to go about when tackling any project. The reason why raising a big fuss over this is not warranted is because we didn't expend any resources acquiring this content. Blizzard likewise did not expend too many resources, possibly because hiring someone better or polishing this further would have detracted from other, more important projects. It told the story it needed to using the resources it needed to. Could it have been better? Of course, always. Anything can be made better with additional effort and resources, but simply put, this was the best that could be done in the allotted time. To compare, look at webcomics. Most webcomics that deal with a wide color palette, complex shapes, and background art release one page every week, MAYBE two if the artists are making a sustainable living off of it which is actually somewhat rare. Ask any artist-writer duo to release 24 pages in a month and they'll call you insane, or they will do exactly what was done with this comic and cut corners. As a personal note, I find the use of in-game assets to help cut down time on the backgrounds to have been a smart move. Sure, original artwork might've been better but again the primary function here is to tell a story.<br />
<br />
Let's assume they 'got it perfect'. The new issue, then, is that the fanbase is simply too big. Art, again, is subjective, so there will always be those who nitpick and exaggerate the little details, robbing away from whatever is good in the work... and this has been demonstrated time and time again in WoW's history. What incentive is there to put effort into something that will offer no reward - not really - vs. expending effort into what will?<br />
<br />
As far as Blizzard's reputation, they are primarily a game company, not a comic publisher. This comic book won't cost their reputation anything significant other than 'oh, their comics suck', or if it does then... well, I honestly have no clue what that says about the fandom. I guess I'll know where its priorities lie in such an event.<br />
<br />
You might look to their Legion pre-release work, but fact is the comics there weren't very good either. The Harbingers videos were a different matter. However, Legion also had more put into it because Blizzard more or less sacrificed whatever potential Warlords of Draenor may have had - cancelling an entire raid tier worth of content, mind - for this massive climactic battle with the Legion. It paid off as a result.<br />
<br />
As for the deviantart bit, it's a bit unfair to compare a 24-page comic that was probably given a week or two deadline - don't quote me on that, I COULD be wrong - versus an independent single-page piece that primarily focuses on visual aesthetics and eye-catching poses without taking other things such as character dynamic, story, speech bubble placement, and other such things into consideration.<br />
<br />
I guess that was what I wanted to really say but I didn't want to use so many words.<br />
<br />

Unlike Emperor, your response is more aggressive than it is defensive, and I wasn't even responding to you in any direct capacity which means you just decided to take it personally... so while I wasn't being high-minded or talking down to anyone before, I sure as shit am going to with you now. But hey, I'll use small words. Just for you. Hope you feel special.<br />
<br />
(That said it ended up being longer than I wanted. Oh, well. S'what happens when you use small words to convey nuance.)<br />
<br />
Amazingly enough, you managed to miss the point whilst boiling away all context. No, you do not need to be an expert to be a critic. However, most of the criticism here was not criticism at all, just mean-spirited trash-talk to artists and authors who will never see it and have no chance to defend their creation. Expertise, credentials, and talent would still not really justify the bad words of the comments but at least they could say 'here, this is how you can improve', which IS criticism. Very harsh criticism, but it gives something to compare the work to.<br />
<br />
Had money been spent on the comic, fine, the anger has something to justify it. But they spent, what, three minutes? Five? A tiny amount of time reading a comic that in no way hurt them, or if it did then that's less on the comic and more on them, really.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, it's not worth the effort.<br />
<br />
This response, though? Worth it. I had fun writing it.</div></div><hr />

Ask any artist-writer duo to release 24 pages in a month and they'll call you insane, or they will do exactly what was done with this comic and cut corners. As a personal note, I find the use of in-game assets to help cut down time on the backgrounds to have been a smart move. Sure, original artwork might've been better but again the primary function here is to tell a story.<br />
<br />
Let's assume they 'got it perfect'. The new issue, then, is that the fanbase is simply too big. Art, again, is subjective, so there will always be those who nitpick and exaggerate the little details, robbing away from whatever is good in the work... and this has been demonstrated time and time again in WoW's history. What incentive is there to put effort into something that will offer no reward - not really - vs. expending effort into what will?<br />
<br />
As far as Blizzard's reputation, they are primarily a game company, not a comic publisher. This comic book won't cost their reputation anything significant other than 'oh, their comics suck', or if it does then... well, I honestly have no clue what that says about the fandom. I guess I'll know where its priorities lie in such an event.<br />
<br />
You might look to their Legion pre-release work, but fact is the comics there weren't very good either. The Harbingers videos were a different matter. However, Legion also had more put into it because Blizzard more or less sacrificed whatever potential Warlords of Draenor may have had - cancelling an entire raid tier worth of content, mind - for this massive climactic battle with the Legion. It paid off as a result.<br />
<br />
As for the deviantart bit, it's a bit unfair to compare a 24-page comic that was probably given a week or two deadline - don't quote me on that, I COULD be wrong - versus an independent single-page piece that primarily focuses on visual aesthetics and eye-catching poses without taking other things such as character dynamic, story, speech bubble placement, and other such things into consideration.<br />
<br />
I guess that was what I wanted to really say but I didn't want to use so many words.<br />
<br />
If they aren't prepared to spend the resources necessary to live up to the quality that they have themselves set over the years, then they shouldn't spend those resources in the first place. A poorly received product may very well be worse than none at all. I'm comparing this not just to the Harbinger of Legion, but also all of these:<br />

Not only are they better drawn, they are partly animated, have voice acting and sound which enhances the experience greatly. These were also all free, and weren't even viewable in-game (which I think is a shame because a lot of players probably missed them). Yes they are a video games company, but they are also well known for their great cinematics, art, music and even books. When they do decide to release something it is expected that it will be well made, something that's really worthwhile and thoroughly enjoyable. If it had been any other company than Blizzard I might not have cared as much.</div></div><hr />

Think we've both made good points, with what information we have. I sure don't have any rebuttal to offer regarding the WoD videos... though it's possible that Blizzard knew that the expansion would suffer and had to pump far more into marketing it. That's pretty much the only thing I can figure, though.<br />
<br />
At least BfA has at this point graduated from the initial response of &quot;lol really that's what you're calling it&quot; to something that can be taken as a serious contender for a good expansion.</div></div><hr />

No, she's not an idiot. She needs others to protect her, and sometimes inspiring loyalty rather than fear is better. Additionally, she's a grade-a asshole, so she likes to watch people suffer before killing them. That's what she's planning for her own sisters before she raises them into servitude under herself.</div></div><hr />

You can hide a knife to take to a meeting to kill someone. But until you pull it out you have not committed a crime, only a rather critical lapse of judgement. Sylvanas is evil, this is not one of those cases.<br />
<br />
<br />
as well the line of &quot;No Anya. I will let them cling to their sorrow-filled lives a little longer. In the end they will serve death, they will serve me&quot;. Which means that she did not stop out of the goodness of her heart, she's still planning on going through with it.<br />
You are not a mind reader. Evidence suggests she did stop because she cares about them, she's always been tsundere about her sisters right from the beginning, remember the necklace in Ghostlands. And what she said is true either way, it doesn't necessarily imply she will kill them but in the end all mortals do die. It's natural. She will obviously want to raise them since she loves them and is a twisted person like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
In Warcrimes she invited Vereesa and her two sons (seen in the comic) to live with her in the Undercity, what Vereesa didn't know was that Sylvanas was planning on killing all three of them and raising them as undead. Sylvanas honestly believes they would want this, and that this would be the best thing for them, that's how fucking twisted your mind becomes when you're raised as Undead, you start to rationalize undeath as something good even if you hated it in life.<br />
Objection, assumption is not supported by evidence. Undeath is a physical condition that, while traumatic, does not affect the mind in any magical or corrupting way. There are undead who have not lost their morality and personality such as Faol or Bartholomew and the many undead in the Argent Crusade. Sylvanas' twisted mind is a product of her torture under Arthas and her obsession for revenge and immortality, not solely on her undeath.</div></div><hr />

Ordering your personal guards to assassinate your sisters upon your command is evil regardless of whether you go through with it or not.<br />

I don't need to be a mind reader, her statement is very clear in that she fully intends on murdering them, along with everyone else for that matter.<br />

<br />
Raising someone as Undead is a magical transition which often leaves the person a shell of their former self, it absolutely affects their mind. That a rare few has managed to maintain some level of morality as well as personality is the exception, not the rule.</div></div><hr />

I don't need to be a mind reader, her statement is very clear in that she fully intends on murdering them, along with everyone else for that matter.And the evidence suggests often what she says about her sisters and what she feels is not exactly the same. Even if she did mean she would kill and raise them later I'll remind you of what you said earlier:<br />
<br />
Sylvanas was planning on killing all three of them and raising them as undead. Sylvanas honestly believes they would want this, and that this would be the best thing for them<br />
Doing what you believe is best for someone else isn't evil. It may be twisted based on what it is, but not evil.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raising someone as Undead is a magical transition which often leaves the person a shell of their former self, it absolutely affects their mind. That a rare few has managed to maintain some level of morality as well as personality is the exception, not the rule.It affects their mind in the form of trauma and shock. Also it's not that few, there are enough for the Desolate Council to threaten control of the Forsaken from sylvanas and enough still have their minds intact to agree to that meeting at Thoradin's Wall, and again enough to join the Argent Crusade. Undeath doesn't corrupt the mind, just reanimates the body with fel magic. Or whatever it is now after the retcons. Sylvanas is just evil because that's who she is, undeath didn't make her that way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scathan</div><div class="date">2018-06-06, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well as time passes it becomes more and more obvious that Sylvanas needs to be put down. Not that she didn't have a point regardins Vereesa fucking up everything, but she went to the reunion with thr intent of having her sisters assassinated and now we are supposed to see her in a positive light cause she didn't. Yet. &quot;Imma gonna kill my sisters later&quot;. Oh, what a nice person.<br />
<br />
It was also nice that she didn't want to play by the rules of the game she suggested. Granted the punchline was probably intended to be: &quot;I lied about not betraying you&quot; as the arrows flew, but still. I used to like her as a character and I like the new Trisfal and Silverpine forest. But now I'm starting to hope she does die and we can finally forget about the mess she has become.<br />
<br />
So I keep seeing that she plans to kill them later, but I don't think that's true, She decided not to kill them now, allowing them to live out their lives. Eventually they will die anyway. I think that is what is meant. <br />
<br />
Second I think it reveals some insight as to what Sylvanas wants with her sisters. I don't think she just wants to murder them. I think they are the only people she has a connection with, and still might feel something for, and so she wants them to be closer to her. It's a twisted sense of love from someone who had their life robbed from them in a horrific fashion. This is further proven by the fact that she DOESN'T actually go through with it.<br />

I agree with a lot of what you said except for this. Sylvanas wasn't evil. Remember she was going to the light when Arthas killed her, but was ripped away when raised as a banshee. She wasn't like this before. Now you can argue that it was the trauma of being turned that turned her bad, and hellbent on revenge. But it doesn't change what the catalyst for change was.<br />

The argument of what makes a person who goes through hardships turn to evil or not is so complex that I'm happy leaving it at &quot;it's debatable&quot; right now, but in the end I was saying sylvanas' current behavior wasn't a product of only undeath but of many things that happened after and during it. The evidence being many others have been afflicted by undeath and decided to become good people instead. That was the point of the highlighted phrase. Sorry if it wasn't clear.</div></div><hr />

Yes, yes, sure. But again we arrive to the same result. The best thing we can say regarding Sylvanas is that she ended up not killing her sisters. Everything else she does is pragmatic at best and horrific at worst. When was the last time she did something that is objectively good?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerisot</div><div class="date">2018-06-06, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It kind of makes sense if you think about it, the void hating the undead...back in WC3, The legion are the ones who created the Lich King in the first place, and minupulated Arthas into creating more undead for them, Mal'ganis had a slight miscalculation in the fact that he for some reason didn't think the Lich King(Ner'zul) would betray them, and lead Arthas to the sword and then to the spire to put on the helm.<br />
<br />
This miscalculation lead by Arthas's hatred for the demons, and now the living, proved to not work in the legions favor, and caused Arthas to betray the legion.<br />
<br />
The Legion's #1 enemy is the void, Sargaras hates the void, he created the legion to counter them, went against everything he believes in just to try and stop them, but I think Sargaras realized that the void hates death, so he planed on raising an army of the dead, to combat them, hence why he took Ner'zul and imprisoned his spirit in order to command the undead for his army, at the time we thought it was to take over Azeroth, but now it is coming into light (no pun intended) that the undead were created to fight the void by any means necessary.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, no, she's pretty much completely evil and there's no way to even jokingly defend it anymore. At this point she's ready to kill her own sisters and raise them to be by her side. She's just another evil Horde leader, probably the worst one we've seen, yet the writing in game makes all the Horde players blindly loyal, ignoring everything she does.</div></div><hr />
