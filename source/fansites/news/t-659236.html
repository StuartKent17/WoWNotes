Patch 3.2 - Where can I get Epic Gems?<br />
The patch will probably hit the live servers very soon and a lot of people ask me the same question : Where can I get the Epic Gems? It shouldn't be hard to answer that, currently there are 4 ways to get them :<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting / Prospecting<br />
You can find epic gems by prospecting Titanium Ore (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36910/titanium-ore/), it's probably not the best way to get it because Titanium is already fairly expensive but if you need as many gems as possible and don't want to wait, go for it. Prospecting Titanium will give you an epic gem 25~30% of the time, the droprate for rare gems seems to be the same, and you will always get an uncommon gem. If you're lucky enough you can even get 2 epics on the same prospect. <br />
<br />
Note: You will also get Titanium Powder (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46849/titanium-powder/) 60% of the time, you can exchange 10 of them for a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/41596/dalaran-jewelcrafters-token/) and get your new recipes even faster. <br />
<br />
Alchemy<br />
New transmutations are available for these gems. (20 Hours cooldown)<br />
<br />
Transmute: Ametrine (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66658/transmute-ametrine/)<br />
Transmute: Cardinal Ruby (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66659/transmute-cardinal-ruby/)<br />
Transmute: Dreadstone (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66662/transmute-dreadstone/)<br />
Transmute: Eye of Zul (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66664/transmute-eye-of-zul/)<br />
Transmute: King's Amber (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66660/transmute-kings-amber/)<br />
Transmute: Majestic Zircon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66663/transmute-majestic-zircon/)<br />
<br />
PvE - Emblems of Heroism<br />
You can buy any of the epic gems for Emblem of Heroism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40752/emblem-of-heroism/). These emblems do not drop anymore in 3.2 and are replaced by Emblems of Conquest in heroic instances / raids dungeons but you can still exchange higher tier emblems. (Emblem of Conquest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/45624/emblem-of-conquest/) -&gt; Emblem of Valor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40753/emblem-of-valor/) &gt; Emblem of Heroism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40752/emblem-of-heroism/).<br />

[color=#A335EE]Ametrine (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36931/ametrine/), [color=#A335EE]Dreadstone (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36928/dreadstone/), [color=#A335EE]Eye of Zul (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36934/eye-of-zul/) can be bought for Emblem of Heroism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40752/emblem-of-heroism/) x 10.<br />
<br />

You can buy any of the epic gems for 10 x Emblem of Heroism.<br />
Last time I checked PTR (2 days ago) Red, Yellow and Blue gems were listed for 20 x Emblem of Heroism.<br />
While Purple, Orange, Green gems were listed for 10 x Emblem of Heroism.<br />
<br />
Honor costs were the same for all 6 colors (10000 honor/gem)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sucks we can't directly trade EoC for EoH since the trade value remains 1=1=1, tho -_-..<br />
<br />
On a side note.. i guess the new Ochre mount for the UDs is found on the UD's mount seller rite?</div></div><hr />

Silly question, are EoH, being converted to EoC? I know that they will no longer drop in 3.2, but as for the ones I already have, they will still remain EoH after patch 3.2 hits, or do they get upgraded? How cool would that be lols.</div></div><hr />

53 dusts, 1 dust from 5 ores so 53x5 = 265 ores<br />

<br />
A lot more then that at first. <br />
<br />
Everyone will need tons of gems to put in their gear, about 10 for a main spec, another 10 if you got a 2nd gear set and even more if you got alts.<br />
<br />
I doubt everyone has stockpiled titanium ore, honor (7.5 gems max with 75k honor) and got that many badges lying around. 20 badges for 1 gem is quite a lot.<br />
<br />
In particular, the red gems (Cardinal Ruby) will most likely fetch 300-400 for a few weeks. The demand will be very high and there will be very few gems at the AH.</div></div><hr />

I would update this and note that this is shared cooldown. Also to get red gem transmute you need to finish quest which require you do 5 transmutes of other color gems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well that's quite disappointing. The original xmutes sounded so nice, then they added shared cooldowns, then they added this silliness. They've all but admitted that red gems are the only worthwhile ones for most of us, but without admitting it.</div></div><hr />

I remember blizzard stating they would give everyone a months heads up to when the patch would probably be released, so that arena people could start finishing up their arenas and get whatever gear that they hadn't gotten. Unless I've missed the news post about when they'll release it. From past patches that have been released around or near blizzcon I'd imagine that they may wait til then or soon after blizzcon this year to release the patch b/c of the pvp tournament there, less they plan on using 3.1 for it while 3.2 is live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no, they only said they would give a month heads up before removing drakes from achievements and if that was going to happen when 3.2 went live. then later they said they weren't removing them at the same time the patch hit, but would still give a month notice if/when they decide to remove them. so you see it was not a month warning for the patch at all. as for arena seasons, its been a standing practice for them to give 2 weeks notice before it ends.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to test this anyway, just to be sure. I guess my confusion is the coding behind it all since the easy thing to code would be to change the loot table of the item itself, not to keep track of each and every Prism and what it already contains.<br />
<br />
Like for instance, Titanium ore. Sure, by itself it's not a &quot;container&quot;, but does that mean current ore from 3.1 can only give 3.1 stuff when prospected, or are the items' &quot;contents&quot; generated at the point of prospecting? Obviously, it would have to be generated on the prospect... otherwise you would need to burn through &quot;3.1 ore&quot; and you wouldn't be able to tell 3.1 ore from 3.2 ore.<br />
<br />
That would be like me selling 3.1 Prisms knowing they have no chance of dropping epic gems (if that happens to be the case) when only the 3.2 Prisms can.</div></div><hr />

kidding aside - battlenet auth has worked flawlessly - I finally coverred mine when this authenticating wait and hang shit started happening last week.. Get off your keister and upgrade your account today! (they should have made a feat of str / pet be a reward from converting acts.<br />
<br />
And my buddy who has been stockpiling his titanium ore has like 600+ just waiting to kill the market :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, I see this as a win for the non-battle.net players. There most likely wouldn't be a need to upgrade and/or fix the authentication server if there wasn't such a massive outcry against battle.net in its current state. There are millions of people out there that won't do it, and the outtage last week proved it. Not only that, but their refusal to join battle.net is what is forcing this fix/upgrade/whatever.<br />
<br />
Multiple 100+ page threads on their forums and most likely huge dropoffs in numbers of players in game and not upgrading prove this. Which means, most likely, they need to fix the normal authentication server, and then fix the unsecured crap that is battle.net.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It makes sense because thats the way it happened in BC, when the level 70 equivalent to the icy prism first came out, it only had blue gems. Later, it was added that epic gems could be looted out of them. But nobody got any epic gems out of ones made before the patch. =-P<br />
<br />
Things like prospecting or milling decide what you get when you use that ability.<br />
Things such as containers are decided upon creation/drop, otherwise if you didn't like the contents you could just not loot and reopen as many times as you want. <br />
And then if you go as far as to say well they could then just save what was in it when you opened... well why not just do that when its made and keep it there permanently anyway.</div></div><hr />

I seem to rememeber a Babaganouch but could have been on a few different servers. Might not even be you.<br />

On topic: So it seems like the easiest way outside of being a JC to get epic gems is to just buy them with marks. I myself have 222 heroism and 198 valor which are currently just rotting in my inventory.</div></div><hr />

Without scouring ~100 posts do we know if they will be trainable normally or is it a Raid drop? <br />

<br />
As with most things in WotLK, we can reference back to BC to see market tendencies.<br />
<br />
And of cource, as with all my posts, no quotes or blue copies, you can just believe me or not :P<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The addition of epic gems will allow top level players that little extra edge on top level gear. They will allow those 'rich' players to buy the best gems possbile. They will allow... well... really anyone who can get their hands on them the ability to do so.<br />
<br />
So how are these gems aquired? Well just as in BC there are a few different ways, granted there are quite a few more way with this round of epic gems.<br />
<br />
But how will this all affect the market? What about blue gems? And what can we expect to see for prices?<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
For this section I will use the base as follows. Bloodstone = 5g, Cut = 7.5g. Scarlet Ruby = 75g, Cut = 100. I dont care if these arn't the real prices, they are just for putting everythign into proportion.<br />
<br />
When the gems hit day one expect to see values up to about 700g for Cardz. Remember that it is very unlikly that wee will see values go over the current values of storm jewles (which hold the same stats). Once in the market and more players get the gems I would expect the gems to fall first to the 500g mark, and then again to the 400g mark. by the time the market has become saturated and the average player has the ability to get the gems on a regular basis I would expect the value to fall to and stay at around 250g. In this the value of blue gems should fall, but should not bottom out comppletly as most players would not place an epic gem into newer gear that will soon be replaces. if the current value of rares that are cut is 100g, I would expect to see thesesfall to about 75g.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pomr</div><div class="date">2009-07-31, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has been stated more than once in this thread that Icy Prisms created after the patch goes live and created on the PTR have a small chance of dropping an Epic gem.<br />
<br />
From the PTR patch notes on the Transmute recipes:<br />
Five new epic gem transmute recipes are available from the Northrend trainer. The recipe for transmuting a Cardinal Ruby can be learned from a quest, given by Linzy Blackbolt in Dalaran.<br />
<br />
All of the above info took about 15-20 seconds for me to 'research'. ^_^</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">filenotfound</div><div class="date">2009-07-31, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">seems people still dont believe that Icy Prism created at 3.1 wont ever have a epic gem ! <br />
<br />
quick way to test this <br />
get a full invent of items .. no gems though .. then open a icy prism .. box will open of whats in it and it will say no room in invent etc etc <br />
<br />
log out log in try again you will see the same contents in that icy prism .. <br />
<br />
so as stated a few times items inside are created at the same time as the prism is actually made and wont change ! <br />
<br />
<br />
anyhoo .. i kinda think markets will be flooded for first week or two and prices wont be that high , ive saved up over 300 stacks of ore and i know a few people who have loads also . this amount of gems hiting the market will mean one thing .. people will be posting more than are being bought and undercuting will be insane. people also wont be rushing to pay 500G + for the 10 gems they need the upgrade isnt that massive .. spell power for instance +4 spl pwr .. x10 = 40 spl power .. most people wont pay 5k+ for a 40 spl pwr upgrade when they know prices will fall in a couple of weeks .. only the hardcore ppl will pay that and tbh the hardcore ppl prolly got a stack load of badges anyway and wont need to buy.</div></div><hr />

1) yes, they will have a chance in icy prism<br />
<br />
2) no, you don't because they're unique.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can't carry more than 1... that's right... <br />
but you can put as much as you want into guild-bank<br />

<br />
There is no predictable relation between the price of storm jewels and epic jewels. Storm jewels are unique, so epics will have higher demand. But epics are crafted, so they will also have higher supply. Who knows how it will come out.</div></div><hr />
