Also, Sanctus who contacted me added a few interesting thoughs in his mail : <br />
The main reason for this email is mostly due to the fact of gaining a unique representation amongst the US servers and EU servers. There are only eight oceanic servers in total and in all progression and new content release cases, oceanic servers is grouped with the US servers as a whole.<br />
<br />
We believe australia and fellow oceanic countries have a strong and commited player base and deserve servers located in the oceanic region so we can have pings equal to those of our competitors around the world. We constantly raid with 400ms, this would be considered 'horrible lag' by those who live in the US that get pings of less then 100.<br />

Farming Skettis trees in 2.2<br />
I was reading this post on the forum, and someone asked if it wouldn't be better to farm the elite trees of Skettis instead of running slave pens to get ancien lichens ? <br />
Good news : It's probably better yes.<br />
Bad news : As far as I know (and according to a mail I received), you can't &quot;gather&quot; these trees anymore in 2.2. <br />
<br />
<br />
Website<br />
Mail server is still down, as well as a few other things, you probably won't notice it most of the time anyway (except if you are trying to reach the site without using the &quot;www.&quot;), hopefully it will be fixed today. <br />

I sincerely hope this is not the case as these elites are basically a herbalists equivalent of the elemental plateau.</div></div><hr />

If i do recall correct our server is in Germany now and i live in sweden and still have a ping of 150 to 200. Was the same to when they where in Paris. I know that some in our guild see 500 ping as normal &gt;_&lt;. But yea its kind of annoying to know uk peeps have like 40 :P</div></div><hr />

I am not sure in Aus and NZ but Southeast Asia (China, Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia, etc.) actually has better and cheaper internet than US.</div></div><hr />

that is true, i personally know Australian internet is crap, i think New Zealand internet is similar to Australia</div></div><hr />

My usual latency is 450ish ms, although on the rare good days it may be as low as 250ms. It gets pretty frustrating in pvp, being hit from 10 yards away, opponents' spell interrupts hitting right on the money etc. I guess its just something we've got to put up with. Makes downing Illidan even more of an achievement IMO, grats and keep it up. I'm on Barthilas, I guess our progression is still a while away.</div></div><hr />

and uk internet is not 40-50ms alot of the time. depending on the provider and the coverage sometimes its pretty dire. only about 60% of the country can get broadband and some of that 60% are so far from the telephone exchange they mayaswell not have broadband.<br />
<br />
not only that but our providers are unusualy strict. got a phone call the other day from BT (british telecom, not black temple xD). &quot;were sorry but uve downloaded &quot;too much&quot; on your &quot;unlimited download limit broadband&quot;&quot; wth man so were going to limit your bandwith for ever. that cocked me up raiding was always over 400ms. not a happy bunny. <br />

I got 1.5mb ADSL (soon to be 20MB :D) and I am always 400+... I have heard that ADSL2 isnt much better because of the international lag :S<br />
<br />
All we want is a few servers in our country that will allow us to play properly. Just yesterday, I was in 2v2 with my bro (so we both had the same issue) and a lock was running right next to me yet I couldnt get a hit because I was out of range... like cmon I have no chance being dotted and not able to know where my target is...<br />
<br />
If blizzard would be nice enough to buy me a house, not even a good house.... I would host and update all the servers... it wouldnt be that hard to restart them once a week and apply a few patches... All testing would be done in the US anyways. Then we could get some Aussie GM's so we can get support tix done while ppl play at 7-10pm rather than 4 in the morning. :X</div></div><hr />

More of an issue is the disconnects, We just recently killed Kael and had 2 people regularly disconnecting and others with at least 1 d/c.<br />
<br />
Arena is even worse, 700ms is extremely common and many nights i've lost a few games and just stopped arena for the day rather than trying to deal with it.<br />
<br />
Other issues facing Oceanic guilds is extremely limited talent; I play on Khaz'goroth (PvE Oceanic) and it is the most populated server of its kind. We're lucky if an applicant even has Molten Core raiding experience. We've pretty much been the top guild since BC came out and in the end we had to merge with another guild to get numbers to even a farming raid :(<br />

Recently i've been levelling an alt paladin and in instances it is rare that more than 1 person has even hit 70 before.<br />
