Another PTR build was pushed recently with no significant changes. This time it was a Test build, while the previous build was a Release Candidate (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2548-PTR-Build-Release-Class-Design-Balance-Q-A-Recap-Blue-Posts-Fan-Art). There is still plenty of time for the patch to go live by the Season 10 end date of November 29.<br />

<br />
Statistics: Achievements and Honor Kills<br />
All of the graphs today allow zooming in both the X and Y direction to allow you to take a closer look at areas of interest. As the US and EU sample sizes were not the same (~3.6 million vs ~2.7 million), the EU results were scaled up to the US sample size, allowing us to directly compare the results.<br />
<br />
The first graph we are looking at today shows you how many characters have an achievement point total in the indicated range of achievement points. For example, the point of 1500 has 103,525 characters for the US. This means that out of the entire sample of the US, 103,525 characters have between 1500 and 1599 achievement points. This type of counting of characters also applies to the other two graphs. <br />
<br />
You can see that US players seem to have more alts or casual players than the EU, but both experience that nice dip right before 9000 achievement points. This is due to the people that are close to It's Over Nine Thousand! (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4496/its-over-nine-thousand/) achievement pushing to finish it. Both the US and EU have two main peaks, likely indicating the population of 85s that has run no dungeons and the part that has run some of the dungeons. This indicates that the majority of the sample does not play enough to get a large amount of achievements on all of their characters.<br />
<br />
Moving on, the second graph has Honor Kills split up by faction, as there was no significant difference between the US and EU. It does appear that at the more casual end of the graph the Horde has a slightly higher amount, but once you get closer to the second half of the graph that gap shrinks to almost nothing. Only part of the range is shown, you can see the entire range (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/november/entireHKGraph.png) is hard to look at. The entire range does show you that the gap of Alliance players is compensated for by the increase at the very low HK level. This indicates that the amount of casual players or alts that are PvPing is significantly higher than the people that play often. <br />
<br />
The final graph breaks down the HKs by realm type, and you can see the players that have less HKs play on the PvE realms, while the players with more play on the PvP realms. Ths gap disappears once you go farther down the graph to the more serious players. The RP realms results look very similar to PvE realms and RPPvP realms look very similar to PvP realms. All of the factions and realms showed a nice bump (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/november/100kHKs.png) around 100k HKs when people were going for the 100000 Honorable Kills (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/870/100000-honorable-kills/) achievement.<br />

Account Security Warning: Steam Compromise<br />
As some of you may know, Valve Software recently announced that certain Steam user account information was compromised by an illegal and unauthorized intrusion into their network. The statement from Valve on these events can be found here:<br />
<br />
http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/index.php<br />
<br />
If you’re a registered account holder with Steam, we encourage you to review the information provided by Valve as soon as possible. We also recommend that you update your Battle.net password via Account Management (https://us.battle.net/account/management) should it be the same as or similar to the one you used for Steam or for the Steam forums. You may also wish to change your registered email address as a further security measure, or to change the password to your email account and other online accounts that might be at risk of compromise. If you are unable to update your Battle.net email address and/or password on your own, please contact our customer support staff for assistance: http://us.blizzard.com/support/webform.xml<br />

Annual Pass with Parental Controls<br />
Blizzard is sending (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2999629980?page=2#25) out an email to people that have purchased the Annual Pass in Europe with Parental Controls enabled to confirm that the parent approves of the free copy of Diablo III due to its rating. If you purchased the Annual Pass and have Parental Controls enabled, you have until November 28 to reply to the email. <br />
<br />
Dear parent or guardian,<br />
<br />
We are writing to you to let you know that the owner of a Battle.net account for which you have registered as the parent or guardian has signed up for the World of Warcraft Annual Pass promotion. This promotion offers a free digital copy of our forthcoming game Diablo III when players commit to a 12-month subscription for World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
However, as Diablo III has been rated as PEGI-16 (USK-16 in Germany), we are writing to you to let you know that this promotion will automatically be removed from the account on November 28, 2011. Once the promotion is removed from the account, the account holder will once again be able to modify their existing World of Warcraft subscription, including removing recurring payments.<br />
<br />
If you instead wish to continue with this promotion and secure a free copy of Diablo III for the account holder when it is launched, please reply to this email before November 28, 2011 stating that you, as the parent or guardian, are happy to continue.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or further requirements, telephone numbers and further help from our Customer Support department can be found at http://eu.blizzard.com/support/.<br />

<br />
Bottom 10% of players have &lt;500 achievement points<br />
Bottom 20% of players have &lt;1000<br />
Bottom 30% have &lt;1500<br />
Bottom 40% have &lt;2000<br />
...<br />
Bottom 95% have &lt;11000<br />
Bottom 99% have &lt;12000<br />
Bottom 99.5% have &lt;13000<br />
<br />
and likewise for HKs - this information doesn't appear reliably anywhere else on the internet as far as I know, so it would be a really interesting and fresh take on studying these statistics for me!</div></div><hr />

Sure alliance has more in the low zone, but also an equal number in the high zones. So technically more alliance have PvPed. Plus more HKs are done on PvE servers. Likely the latter is due to higher population on those, but the Alliance one is surprising given the fact Horde is billed as the PvP faction.The stereotypes are flipping, it would seem.</div></div><hr />

It is not clear if it is only for players that purchased the annual pass or if the question is whether a free copy of Diablo was enough to convince you to buy an annual pass or not.For me, I bought an AP for the beta invite, as well as the fact that I'm confident I'll still be playing a year from now.</div></div><hr />

I did that a while back, see http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2187-Battleground-Horde-Alliance-Win-Ratio-Setup-of-the-Month<br />
<br />
The only thing stopping me from doing it again is the lack of Statistics support in the new Armory API. The developers seem to have abandoned it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My main has 10505, only 2252 others besides me? Hmm. Seems a bit low!<br />
<br />
Only 2,252 have between 10,500 and 10,600 achievement points. There are at least 15k+ that have more than you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and while i remember nowhere in my OP did i use the word retarded<br />
<br />
ie posoning the pve content coz of pvprs<br />
<br />
theres nothing new in that test build and you know it<br />
<br />
they are just posponing it to plz the pvprs for there mmr reset<br />
I don't think there has ever been an instance of Blizzard favoring PVP over PVE. Their concern is making sure everyone is busy enjoying all the new 4.3 stuff when TOR releases on Dec. 20th. November 29th is still going to be a couple of weeks earlier than expected. November 15th would have been ridiculously early; people would already be bored senseless of the new heroics in a month's time.<br />
<br />
There have been a couple of times when the new PVP season has started one or more weeks after the content patch hits for PVE. The new PVP has never started before PVE content and almost certainly never will.<br />
<br />
Raiders will be able to get 397 weapons the first week of 4.3, and if they have a good PVE group they could get 403s from Deathwing with the possibility of 410s from Heroics during the second week. Meanwhile, PVPers will probably have to have earned 7800 Conquest before buying a 397 weapon. This takes:<br />
<br />
6 weeks at 1350 CP/wk (8 arena wins at baseline rating)<br />
5 weeks at 1560 CP/wk (RBGs at baseline rating give 1650)<br />
4 weeks at 1950 CP/wk<br />
3 weeks at 2600 CP/wk<br />
<br />
I don't know what kind of ratings the good players will be at immediately after the MMR reset, but the PVPers with a good PVE group are going to have a large advantage in the first few weeks of Season 11 if they get a weapon. You look at some of the other Dragon Soul drops that are going to be PVP BiS, to say nothing of the damned legendary that will still undoubtedly proc in PVP, and I don't think you'll find a PVPer who feels like they're being favored in the slightest.<br />

I didn't think the question was that hard.<br />
<br />
Did you purchase the Annual Pass?<br />
<br />
No, I purchased Diablo 3 for free (this part of the Annual Pass so that would be a yes)<br />
No, I purchased for the free Beta (that would be part of the Annual Pass so again that is a yes)<br />

None of this nonsense about why you got it; &quot;Did you purchase the Annual Pass?&quot; doesn't even hint at the slightest suggestion of implying that maybe it has even a passing interest in the why, it literally just asks about the what. If you got it for D3, you got it. If you got it for the mount, you got it. If you got it for the beta, you got it. If you got it because all your friends were getting it, you got it. If you got it because you weren't paying attention and were just randomly clicking on the screen, you got it.<br />
<br />
The reason it's poorly worded is: I'm pretty sure you can't purchase something that's free. You're paying for WoW; the pass isn't you paying for something, it's you agreeing to keep paying for WoW.<br />
<br />

The sample clearly did not catch every player in the US or EU. There are 32,885 characters in the sample that have over 100k HKs. I just happened to pick RP vs RPPvP for that graph demonstrating the 100k bump.</div></div><hr />

It's the other way around for me.<br />
I really wanted to give WoW another try, and after resubbing for 1 month I really enjoyed the game, really thought about getting the annual pass.<br />
But after playing the swtor beta this weekend, the annual pass would've been wasted money :)<br />

<br />
Currently the OZ dollar is about $1.04 US (give or take)<br />
I would assume it will stay that way for at least 6 months<br />
by the last payment might be anywhere between $0.90 - $1.10 going by current trends<br />
<br />
$12.99 per month for a 6-month recurring subscription – $155.88 USD<br />
New games in Oz are about 90-110 AUS <br />
Collectors editions are about 150-160 AUS<br />
<br />
(as you can see we Aussies get screwed over games hence why we like Digital downloads and paying for them on overseas accounts :D)<br />
<br />
Lets say I stop playing wow once Diablo 3 comes out (very possible for some players) and lets assume it comes out jan/feb <br />
that means 2 months used. $26<br />
<br />
so if i get the standard Diablo 155.88 - ~100 means im paying - $26 for 2 months access (give or take) = $30 for a mount and closed beta access for mop AND access for a year.<br />
<br />
mounts are about $25 so yes.. i paid $5 for closed beta access totally worth it imo</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with it is that beyond the questing -- which is like the TOR games which is all great and fun -- the game is 100% identical to WoW in every shape and form. There was no innovation done for SWTOR. ZERO. <br />
<br />
Like, if I had to play SWTOR, I'd level up, then get to endgame... then quit. Because at least in WoW I'm already established, geared, and have a great group of friends to spend time with. <br />
<br />
If I stuck with SWTOR, it'd be like hopping off of a bus that was full of your friends to get onto another bus full of all the douchebags that USED to be on your old bus that did nothing but whine that they were bored.... to realize that they're just going to be as whiny in this new bus as they were in the old bus. Then the added bonus that since this bus was never stress-tested before, it'll break down, burst tires, door will get jammed so people can't get on/off the thing and other problems for the first 6 months. <br />
<br />
You may as well get back on the bus you know at least works and has people you know and like in it.</div></div><hr />

Sad thing is the last of my friends that played don't play anymore and it's been boring as of late i'm not even sure why I login everyday just to sit in town and watch the players run by. I guess i'm holding out for something interesting to happen to get my drive back into this game maybe. Planning on getting Swtor but the thing is i'm not a big fan of Starwars. The only thing I liked in Starwars were the original movie and that's about it. Its just that I have family and friends that are and going to be playing it when it comes out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The value of primary stats will move closer to secondary stats, and the value of secondary stats will be brought closer together to make gear choices easier and better.<br />
<br />
The game is getting dumbed down further<br />
<br />
<br />
As a Monk you can heal competitively without ever having to target a friendly player.<br />
<br />
Monks will be the &quot;OP&quot; class for at least the first few patches, purposely, to sell more copies of MoP.<br />
<br />
<br />
New raiding model that gives 8 buffs; Health, Attack Power, Spell Power, Melee Haste, Spell Haste, Crit, Mastery and Primary Stats.<br />
<br />
Content will be progressively nerfed after initial clears by big name guilds. The fight will always be getting easier week to week, regardless of your own efforts.<br />
<br />
IWIN button gets bigger and bigger every expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
But but all the big name guilds say Cata has been the hardest expansion ever and the fights the best ever !<br />
They are <br />
paid sponsors. Paid to tell you what Blizz wants you to hear. Just like a video game site that gives near-perfect reviews for trash games (ahem, MW3)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spike`</div><div class="date">2011-11-14, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some reasons for the people to take the annual pass <br />
<br />
1. they really like the game and will play it over 12 months anyway. <br />
2. they want the mount and access to MoP beta. <br />
3. they were blindly from the &quot;offer&quot; and signed but regret it now. <br />
.... <br />
<br />
I signed but not for the game, not for the mount but for Diablo 3 and MoP beta <br />
<br />
yes i could buy Diablo 3 on release but how economy are i don't have the money the pay all that 60€ upfront, basically i see this like a loan to the bank, pay easily/low with interests (i will play 4.3 for more 3 months, 3,5m, so not much interests vs that months plus the cost of Diablo 3) and then i could see Beta and if the game worth it <br />
<br />
but really i was expecting around 100k signed</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diancecht</div><div class="date">2011-11-14, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its just... nothing impressive. and its WAY too much focus on story to compete in an MMO market. I honestly never once felt like i was playing an MMO, and not in the &quot;oh i was so immersed in it it was awesome&quot; kinda way, but in the &quot;you mean i have to sit through another 40min of run around talk to so and so, talk to so and so, run around, talk to so and so, before i get to actually kill stuff again?&quot;<br />
<br />
If you never felt like you were playing an MMO it makes me wonder if you ever grouped during the beta. I grouped with my wife and some friends for everything from questing to flashpoints. Grouping with others for your questing makes the process 100x more enjoyable and you are rewarded for it with social points. The ability to holocall in to turn in your quest while your away but a group member is talking to a questgiver is really slick. It could be you're just not the target for SWTOR, because I found myself having some of the most fun waiting to see who would win the roll during the conversations and some of the responses led us to wildly different places than i would have ended up. Specifically during the first flashpoint there's at least two branching paths that change which bosses you fight and such by which choice is picked during a conversation. <br />
<br />
Yes, there is a lot of story, but experiencing that story with friends is incredibly enjoyable, rewarding, and a part of the focus of the game. Don't experience the story on your own or you will likely feel like you're playing some single player game and not an mmo, but it will be your own fault.<br />
<br />
Though at least you didn't say it plays like wow, because after this weekend I don't know what those people are talking about. It's both bad and good that it doesn't play like WoW, but if I had a gun to my head and had to say what mmo it played like it is CLEARLY EQ2 with lightsabers. Down to the scale of the zones, the groups of enemies instead of single mobs, and the full voicing. It's EQ2 with lightsabers if anything. . . Which really aint that bad, because a refined EQ2 sounds pretty awesome to me.</div></div><hr />

Yes! I have an idea that I think is pretty cool. Would you consider doing something such as creating graphs of the number and type of specs used in PvP vs. PvE for each class? As an example: 1st graph could compare the total number of warlock specs vs each other 2nd graph could compare the # of warlock specs used PvE 3rd graph could compare the # of warlock specs used in PvP Does this kind of make sense? The other graph idea is items (by type) most used as transmog gear by specific class! For example, the number of rogues who wear Cursed Vision of Sargeras :cool:</div></div><hr />

Their concern is making sure everyone is busy enjoying all the new 4.3 stuff when TOR releases on Dec. 20th. November 29th is still going to be a couple of weeks earlier than expected. November 15th would have been ridiculously early; people would already be bored senseless of the new heroics in a month's time.<br />
<br />
There have been a couple of times when the new PVP season has started one or more weeks after the content patch hits for PVE. The new PVP has never started before PVE content and almost certainly never will.<br />
<br />
Raiders will be able to get 397 weapons the first week of 4.3, and if they have a good PVE group they could get 403s from Deathwing with the possibility of 410s from Heroics during the second week. Meanwhile, PVPers will probably have to have earned 7800 Conquest before buying a 397 weapon. This takes:<br />
<br />
6 weeks at 1350 CP/wk (8 arena wins at baseline rating)<br />
5 weeks at 1560 CP/wk (RBGs at baseline rating give 1650)<br />
4 weeks at 1950 CP/wk<br />
3 weeks at 2600 CP/wk<br />
<br />
I don't know what kind of ratings the good players will be at immediately after the MMR reset, but the PVPers with a good PVE group are going to have a large advantage in the first few weeks of Season 11 if they get a weapon. You look at some of the other Dragon Soul drops that are going to be PVP BiS, to say nothing of the damned legendary that will still undoubtedly proc in PVP, and I don't think you'll find a PVPer who feels like they're being favored in the slightest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again I spend far too long replying to a guy who probably can't/won't read/understand what I say.<br />
<br />
oh i understand u alright but i realy belive blizz would be that incompitant i think it may work like icc if blizz are anyuhing to go with i assume theyd put some gating inplace like icc and toc (i dono how often the gating will ne unlocked) but remember icc lasted a year (5 monts of that was due to gating) icc wouldnt have lasted half the time it did if it wasnt for the gating dont denie it<br />
<br />
i just dont/ddint think blizz are that stupid<br />
<br />
and correct me if im wrong but wouldnt a MMR reset put all players bck to 0 or 1500</div></div><hr />

I mean, short of people being stupid and signing up just to sign up what other reasons could you be unhappy with?<br />
<br />
The way I see it, if you signed up for the annual pass without wanting Diablo 3 then you made a bad decision and have expendable income for mounts/beta keys so it shouldn't matter anyway. If you did sign up because you wanted Diablo 3 you essentially you got 6 months of WoW free. (Because buying Diablo would of cost you 6 monthsish of WoW sub) If you're complaining because now you've decided that Blizzard has detroyed all that is holy with their introduction of Pandas (/mindboggle) then what else do you have to lose? <br />
<br />
And we all know 99% of these people complaining will buy the expansion, which means you would have resubscribed after so even if you would have quit between now and then you're not really out anything.<br />
<br />
I love the offer, as far as I'm concerned it is Blizzard giving me a free mount, beta key and game for doing what I would have done the next year anyway.. been subscribed to WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes because we all know that everyone that signed up for the annual pass are bored with the game /sarcasm.<br />
<br />
I bought it cause it was a good deal for me I already planned on getting Diablo 3 and was planning on staying with WoW for a long period of time because of what I had seen in 4.3 and what is coming up in MoP. Plus in my opinion Blizzard makes some top notch games so that's why I'm going to stay as well. I'm not one of those people that jump from the new flavor of the month MMO (aka SWToR next up GW2) then back to WoW.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thurizas</div><div class="date">2011-11-14, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice statistics. One thing I'd really like to see is a breakdown by percentile, something like this:<br />
<br />
Bottom 10% of players have &lt;500 achievement points<br />
Bottom 20% of players have &lt;1000<br />
Bottom 30% have &lt;1500<br />
Bottom 40% have &lt;2000<br />
...<br />
Bottom 95% have &lt;11000<br />
Bottom 99% have &lt;12000<br />
Bottom 99.5% have &lt;13000<br />
<br />
and likewise for HKs - this information doesn't appear reliably anywhere else on the internet as far as I know, so it would be a really interesting and fresh take on studying these statistics for me!<br />
<br />
This is easy, although tedious, to get. If you mouse over the graph you can get the actual numbers in each interval, just do this for the entire graph, enter the data in a spread sheet and go to town. For example, being bored, I did this for acheivement points (and assuming I made no error in data entry), the numbers are:<br />

Would you consider doing something such as creating graphs of the number and type of specs used in PvP vs. PvE for each class? As an example: 1st graph could compare the total number of warlock specs vs each other 2nd graph could compare the # of warlock specs used PvE 3rd graph could compare the # of warlock specs used in PvP Does this kind of make sense? The other graph idea is items (by type) most used as transmog gear by specific class! For example, the number of rogues who wear Cursed Vision of Sargeras :cool:<br />
<br />
No way to tell which spec is used for which activity, but we will do transmog gear popularity rankings if possible.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">F-Minus</div><div class="date">2011-11-14, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can someone please explain to me why there are people complaining about the Annual Pass? I mean, short of people being stupid and signing up just to sign up what other reasons could you be unhappy with?<br />
<br />
The way I see it, if you signed up for the annual pass without wanting Diablo 3 then you made a bad decision and have expendable income for mounts/beta keys so it shouldn't matter anyway. If you did sign up because you wanted Diablo 3 you essentially you got 6 months of WoW free. (Because buying Diablo would of cost you 6 monthsish of WoW sub) If you're complaining because now you've decided that Blizzard has detroyed all that is holy with their introduction of Pandas (/mindboggle) then what else do you have to lose? <br />
<br />
And we all know 99% of these people complaining will buy the expansion, which means you would have resubscribed after so even if you would have quit between now and then you're not really out anything.<br />
<br />
I love the offer, as far as I'm concerned it is Blizzard giving me a free mount, beta key and game for doing what I would have done the next year anyway.. been subscribed to WoW.<br />
<br />
It's really simple, people who complain are those who don't have a credit card (and parent wont give theirs considering it's a 1 year contract) or those that aren't eligible to this offer. It's mostly jealousy in other words. <br />
<br />
I signed up, cause I'll &quot;play&quot; for a year anyway, thanks to the automated guild leader change imposed by Blizzard in the next patch. Even tho I once took monthly breaks, I still probably paid for about 10 months a year anyway, so this is no drama for me to fork 12x12EUR. Diablo 3 is a nice addition, tho I will play it for sure, I don't think I will invest heavily into it. Beta access is also nice, it'll get some use (don't want to spoil myself before the actuall x-pac release) and the mount I don't care about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I'm just old fashioned, but there's no way in -hell- I'm committing to a hobby.<br />
<br />
When you sign up for the annual pass you aren't really committing to anything.. You can stop paying any time you want, you'll just lose your extra privileges like the Diablo 3 license, the mount, and the beta key.. it's not like you are signing a contract and Blizzard will sue you if you don't pay...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koloss</div><div class="date">2011-11-14, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if you don't do heroic raids just normal modes and no meta-achievments, so simply if you're playing by not caring about achievments you will have about 2k if you're PvPing and PvE-ing too from the beginning of the game i guess. It's maybe not that accurare i have much more, just saying that achievments doesn't mean that you've been playing for not long ago, also i think people don't care about their alts' achievment and alts are in majority of the character-population in the game imo.</div></div><hr />

Where does it say this? When I signed up for it, it said that the terms cannot be cancelled. Not sure what part it mentioned what you just did.</div></div><hr />

The only thing stopping me from doing it again is the lack of Statistics support in the new Armory API. The developers seem to have abandoned it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Only 2,252 have between 10,500 and 10,600 achievement points. There are at least 15k+ that have more than you.<br />
<br />
I remember the last bg breakdown. The problem was that queues didn't work properly until 4.2 released, the game was broken for the first half of Cataclysm. What I would like to see is exclusively data of bg's (and maybe also rated bg breakdowns if possible?) since 4.2 fixed the queue system. Anyhow, thanks for the stats that you do put up, they are all interesting and fun to read about.</div></div><hr />

Why scale EU when you could have ploted a % of total player base vs achieve points, and had comparable numbers from the get go. Scaling never makes things comparable.<br />
<br />
As I do not plan on purchasing DIII there is no reason to spend more on a years subscription than necessary. 6 months is $77 and change, a year is double that $154- The years subscription with DII was $180 I believe. So what are you gaining if you do not plan on purchasing DIII, just a $27 mount. <br />
<br />
I am sticking with the 6 month sub, it makes wow a little cheaper.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frott</div><div class="date">2011-11-15, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a mixed list: Yes, No, I no Longer Play, Account isn't eligible. <br />
<br />
Yes and No are the only real poll options, either you did or you didn't. You could &quot;no longer play&quot; and have purchased it, I am one of those people. So I should be able to choose Yes AND I no longer play. Account isn't eligible is a subset of no, and you're going to get mixed results. You'll get people who choose no because their account isn't eligible, you'll get those who choose account isn't eligible. <br />
<br />
<br />
In the future it would be interesting if you broke out YES / NO with corollary WHY followups: <br />
1. Yes, free diablo III and I'm not quitting wow as far as I can tell <br />
2. Yes, free diablo III though I might not continue playing wow I can afford it. <br />
3. Yes, I don't play wow now but might start again <br />
4. No, my account isn't eligible <br />
5. No, I quit wow for now. <br />
6. No, I might quit wow soon. <br />
7. No, don't care about this deal.<br />
<br />
Is a far better poll than what you've presented. This mixed list just annoys me as one of the people who doesn't currently play wow but might return when the expansion comes out and is not effected by the cost. If the goal of this poll is to show the details, it fails. If it is meant to create fairly useless generalizations I guess it works.</div></div><hr />

51k people got an annual pass already, just amongst the mmo-champ readers.51k is more than the total playerbase of some active mmo's out there, and there is a _lot_ of wow players who don't even know what mmo-champ is.So much for the &quot;wow is dying&quot; crap ;p<br />

Actually, you could choose to pay for the Annual sub however you liked, as 1/3/6 month segments, just like a normal sub. So you could have paid for 2 6 month sub chunks just like your example, and still get all the freebies...</div></div><hr />

People do it for a multitude of reasons: For some, it's fun. Others want to bring awareness to the fact that PollDaddy is bad, etc.<br />
<br />
PD is probably the largest of small scale survey websites, where as Survey Monkey is generally for more &quot;important&quot; surveys since they provide statistical analysis, etc.<br />
<br />
A lot of radio stations and local organizations use PD for simple give a ways and contests --- these scripts are used to force a certain winner. For some reason, some people took it upon themselves to use it on this poll.</div></div><hr />

Their concern is making sure everyone is busy enjoying all the new 4.3 stuff when TOR releases on Dec. 20th. November 29th is still going to be a couple of weeks earlier than expected. November 15th would have been ridiculously early; people would already be bored senseless of the new heroics in a month's time.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
I don't know what kind of ratings the good players will be at immediately after the MMR reset, but the PVPers with a good PVE group are going to have a large advantage in the first few weeks of Season 11 if they get a weapon. You look at some of the other Dragon Soul drops that are going to be PVP BiS, to say nothing of the damned legendary that will still undoubtedly proc in PVP, and I don't think you'll find a PVPer who feels like they're being favored in the slightest.<br />
<br />
What an excellent post. I could not say any better. The numbers show that many of casual players (3-5k points) have a significant number of Hk's. Why so? They cannot raid much or cannot raid at all.<br />
<br />
I could only raid on weekends and it took me to stay awake till 4am. As someone who got something else beyond WoW I could not keep the pace as much as I wanted. So I turned to PvP. After hundreds and thousands of AVs/ABs/WSGs and nearly same rewards I quit the game and went to dying Warhammer. They have what I wanted - non-instanced neverending war with plenty of perks to work for. I am soooo pissed with rigid-minded GS and Kalgan who put us in a fixed bracket of &quot;Raid is a top priority&quot;. It was so bloody simple to create a few World-PvP zones but they reluctantly refused doing that. Arena and raids - nothing else. And I was wondering what a rogue, ele shammy, frost mage and holy pal could do at arena? There were no team for four, our setup didn't look like a best win, and none of us was tempted to do arenas - we spent most of the time at BGs and WGs doing mass-pvp. Now all of us left the game. But we will go to Swtor.<br />
<br />
The number tell us that even if the game is pve-oriented there is a huge demand for pvp and this should not be overlooked.<br />
<br />
For those wondering why so many people answered &quot;I don't WoW anymore&quot; the answer is simple - we still love the game and wait forit to change and meet our demands.</div></div><hr />
