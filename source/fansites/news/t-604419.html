If you read my news carefully you probably saw the screenshot of Sunwell loots I posted a few days ago and I probably was the first to publicly claim &quot;LOL FAKE !&quot;. <br />
<br />
However, it looked real, too real to not be checked and I spent the week trying to gather information in a few places, and it became very interesting. I can now say that these loots are most likely real, and you will probably see most of them in Sunwell Plateau. (95% chance to see them, I'll keep the 5% chance that they're fake just to feel secure) There is obviously no official source to confirm this, but most of you know that I wouldn't post this without a good reason. <br />
<br />
Items seems to be ilvl 154~155<br />
At least one of them is ilvl 164 (Apolyon, the Soul-render), we can assume it's a loot from Kil'jaeden. I didn't try to get the ilvl for all items, maybe there are more loots from KJ. <br />
Even if they're legit, these stats are probably from early beta servers and could be changed/removed once the 2.4 patch is released on PTR. <br />
The feral staff is with the caster weapons, I know, I'm not redoing the screenshot just because of that. :/<br />
Nothing is confirmed by Blizzard, trust it at your own risks. <br />
(Bonus) It seems that the Arena Season 4 sets will be named &quot;Brutal Gladiator&quot;. This one is still fairly unconfirmed though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All these items are from the old screenshot posted a few days ago, I did a clean version to make it more readable. Here you go (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwell_loots.jpg) ! <br />
<br />
Obviously, that's not all the Sunwell loots, there are many more that we'll be able to discover once the PTR patch is released ... soon ?<br />

There's grammatical and spelling mistakes in more than a few items, coupled alongside the fact that there is no way for this to be released right now. Leaked items come from data-mining on PTRs for the most part, the latest PTR was for a minor patch and there is no chance of Blizzard just &quot;accidentally&quot; slipping in a ton of Sunwell loot. Also, if these screenshots were taken in-game, there would be a background behind the text.<br />

The original screenshot has many of the same grammatical errors. Blizzard almost never puts an item in-game with an error in it's text, much less multiple ones at the same time. The original also has the backgrounds, however they are not from any new area so that doesn't add any credibility.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siedre</div><div class="date">2008-01-22, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed, I was just looking at the Druid staff to make a determination. The item developers finally normalized Druid weapons to consistently match the DPS of same-level &quot;human&quot; weapons. All you have to do is follow this equation: DPS = (Feral weapon AP / 14) + 55, then compare it to any same-level weapon.<br />
<br />
You can check it out yourself by comparing gladiator feral weapons with gladiator 2H sword, axe, etc. Season 3 weapons match at ~134 DPS. If the DPS from this Sunwell staff were equal to Apolyon then I'd put some credence to these items. But the feral staff is off by 8 DPS at 140.5. Apolyon shows 148.7. Since the devs went to such a huge effort to normalize feral weapons, I couldn't fathom them messing up now.</div></div><hr />

The Apolyon weapon has a warrior adjusted dps of ~173. In comparison, a s2 2hander is ~140, a s3 is ~150, and the current highest 2h in the game is Cataclysm at ~156. This puts the Apolyon a full 2 seasons ahead of our current one. Either these stats are incorrect, or Blizzard intends to put s5 weapons in competition against s3 wielding non-raiders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Along the same lines as what Boubouille said with AQ stuff getting leaked, I remember a ring from AQ (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21836#comments), with a spelling error. Also, this is internal testing, things get changed. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out though.</div></div><hr />

Correct me if I'm wrong but they're all new icons in the original picture. Here look:<br />
<br />
(I had to zoom in Microsoft Picture Manager to see them all well. Save them so you can too.)<br />
The one on the left looks like a dagger, the othere two look like staffs.<br />
http://i215.photobucket.com/albums/cc8/dattebury/sunwellfakestaff.jpg<br />
<br />
Bottom left looks like a sunwell type sheild, middle right a dagger, top right a sword.<br />
http://i215.photobucket.com/albums/cc8/dattebury/sunwellfakesheild.jpg<br />
<br />
Top icon looks like a staff, second from bottom (orange and dark brown)<br />
looks too dark to tell, but seems new.<br />
http://i215.photobucket.com/albums/cc8/dattebury/sunwellfakestaff2.jpg<br />
<br />
Purple crystal and grey sheild.<br />
http://i215.photobucket.com/albums/cc8/dattebury/sunwellfakestone.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
However, the shoulders look like T3 shaman on a human recolored. <br />
Blizzard said they would reuse T3...but only in Naxx. So I have my doubts there.<br />

<br />
Although, I wuoldn't say the shoulders are recolored shaman t3 - the 'ball' is different and it seems that those shoulders only seem to have three spikes whereas the shaman t3 ones had 6 (and those were slightly different, I think?). Check this (http://www.wowhead.com/?screenshot=view&amp;3.22467#565) screen for a close up look at the shaman t3.</div></div><hr />

That kinda makes sense... but didn't Blizz say that the welfare epics from Magister's Terrace will only be Upper Kara quality? That mace is ridiculously amazing if it drops from there.<br />

Some testing will always go over any item, and nothing it perfect at first creation.<br />
<br />
Even if they were real, the chance is pretty big that Blizz will throw some stats around and change the names, just because it was out already. <br />

I'm pretty sure Blizz has said that they'll rehash T3 for WotLK's Naxx, so it'd be kinda weird for them to use those models now. They're gonna make a different set of models for Sunwell, so they'll probably use those for S4.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghrim</div><div class="date">2008-01-22, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually i don't know whre you get the information that these items are ilvl 154/164 (which the real ones probably will be).<br />
<br />
You just have to compare some of them with the existing ones (or just calculate the ilvl but the first approach is more &quot;visible&quot;).<br />
<br />
Take the Healer staff (Golden Staff of the Sin'dorei) and compare it to Apostle of Argus (ilvl 151, max at this time). The new Healer staff should get a maximum increase of 13 ilvl (if Blizz stays with the system, new &quot;normal&quot; bosses 3 lvls above last tiers &quot;end&quot;boss. New endboss 10 lvls higher). What it actualy gets is:<br />
<br />
- 2 sta<br />
- 5 int<br />
~- 1 spi (23 mp5 is about 58 Spi in itempoints)<br />
+ 64 heal (biggest increase up to date on a healer weapon from one tier to another, should get less actually for higher tiers as stacking one stat on a item increases the actual itempoints the stat contributes (because of ((itemstat1*itempoints1)^1.5 +(itemstat2*itempoints2)^1.5 +(itemstat2*itempoints2)^1.5 +.. )^2/3<br />
+ 32 haste<br />
+ 3 sockets (!)<br />
<br />
so with just blue socketing you can for example get a 118 plus on heal from only this item (along with increased haste rating)<br />
<br />
The calculated itemlvl is nowhere near 154 or even 164. It's about 20 points higher in the 180 region.<br />
Only seen from the increase in the stats (which is as said overall higher than between lower tiers, whereas it should be lower due to the calculation of the ilvl) you see, that some of these items are way too good. The ilvl increase on this weapon (from Archi to sunwell normal boss or endboss) ranges as high as the increase from normal kara boss item to Kael/Vashj loot.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its the last TBC instance, with the little info we have on WotLK we can expect another arena season before the next expansion. SW being the final instance that TBC has to offer allows them to make some items bette then they should be, because in all fairness, people wont be using them very long. Remember naxx? Same concept.<br />
Keep in mind that even if SW gets released bosses will still have to be unlocked by doing daily's serverwide.<br />
This will take some time aswell due to players not being able to speed it up as was done with AQ40 gates.<br />
With 2.4 not being on the ptr now, or in the near future, it could take a while before people can even start to begin to practise on KJ. <br />
They can make the loot as imba as they want, because by the time players will have reached lvl75 they have replaced it by some random questgreen.</div></div><hr />

The Warglaives will be outdated, as the weapons above allready are. But currently they are still made of win, due to the haste bonus.Clearly, pre-BC Legendaries being replaced by BC Epics compares well with lv70 Legendaries being replaced by lv70 Epics.</div></div><hr />

Did you just not get to raid naxx? <br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Maybe you're just lying to try and prove a point..<br />
<br />
But a good 90% of my Naxx gear didn't get replaced till I got into 70 instances. Some lasted me into Lower Spire in Kara. <br />
<br />
So before you go off saying that Last Instance pre-xpac will be replaced halfway to 80.. try to think a little.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The subject is the warglaives, not SW loot.<br />
BT/HY will no longer be the top notch loot, SW stuff will be better, so if you compare it instancewhise SW will become your Naxx and BT/HY will be BWL/AQ40.<br />
BWL/AQ40 stuff got replaced sooner while lvling up then naxx gear ofc, hell i know plenty of players that used T3 while starting lvl70 raids, just like you said.<br />
<br />
Will the warglaives be usefull while lvling to 80? Sure, but that doesnt mean they wont be replaced at all, just because of &quot;lore&quot; reasons or them being legendary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I somehow doubth very strongly, that the warglaives will find a replacer before Naxxramas 2.0 <br />
According to Blizzard, SW loot will be like AQ loot. Kinda &quot;offsets&quot; special designed towards offspecs , so tanks and healers can easier level in wotlk.<br />
As druid, I strongly doubth that there will be gear (not weapons), better than Tier6, due to the setbonuses.<br />
<br />
<br />
If it was a type he would have said that in his response, not a defense to the point that I made.<br />
<br />
Secondly Blizzard has stated the gear would be better than tier 6 but not a tier 7. That doesn't mean it is just for offsets, they said this because like in AQ there will not be unique armor for each class rather than armor types. And as for resto druids unless the SW set bonuses are horrible then it will have to be an upgrade with them, for feral it would be hard to top.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fyske</div><div class="date">2008-01-23, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personaly find this funny how so many people just jump and scream fake before they even check in question the items properly.<br />
<br />
Most items are slightly higher level than 151 (probably 154), which fits the idea that the instance's difficulty will be toward T6 geared people. I have no idea why people think the Two-Hand Axe has a way too high DPS. It seems logical, as it would drop from the last boss of the Sunwell, it will probably have the same kind of &quot;OMFG&quot; type of feeling when you met a top geared warrior smashing your face with Might of Menethil.<br />
<br />
The damage range is definately not off, check Cataclysm's Edge, Blizzard just intended to limit it's use so that it doesn't goes overcrazy. So that they normalize the S3 weapon damage to 580 max. (Check all the S3 weapons, they are at 580 top damage, the Edge is at 580, Jin'rohk is at 570, the other random two-hand weapons are also usually limited to 580 top damage.)<br />
<br />
The trinkets are pretty much on par with what you'd expect at ilvl 151+, just check out Memento of Tyrande, Skull of Gul'dan or the Band of the Eternal Restorer. If it's not some crazy jewelry, I don't know what is it.<br />
<br />
And who remember people screaming fake when Ahn'quiraj or Naxxramas gear got linked? So much people screamed fake.. At that time, when we saw the first screenshots of the Dark Edge of Insanity, everyone screamed fake because most people were completely sure there's no way in hell a two-hand axe should hit this hard. (To remind people, the Axe's damage went from 256 - 385 damage to 242 - 364.)<br />
<br />
A lots of this gear might end up becoming the next &quot;rare&quot; piece people would love to obtain in WOTLK because it scaled pretty well, but can't because most people won't do Sunwell over and over anymore at 80. If you remember at all, the screenshot even contained the entry of a Gryphon flying mount for TBC.<br />
<br />
Oh and, no, Blizzard never do any typos, ever. Ritssyn's Ring of Choas, for best know item. :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Yea im gona like go crazy i mean come on an epic dagger with more dps then legendary swords? it wasnt like that at sixty days :\.<br />
Just because a epic weapon has more DPS than a Legendary doesn't mean it's going to output more DPS. What make Legendaries are also their procs or special bonuses. Such as Thunderfury, Atiesh or... Warglaives (Haste Proc.) I can guarantee you that you won't go as high as high as a Rogue using Warglaive. The haste proc will make sure of that.<br />
<br />
The only thing that feel weird is that the items are so powerful they almost make the Tempest Keep encounter's item legendary weapons like &quot;slightly better than epics&quot; with a extreme proc.</div></div><hr />

Well, i don't think so. In pre-TBC there were 3 armor tiers, in TBC there are 3 armor tiers. Arena armor is based on tears (the looks are based on armor tiers).<br />
And since Sunwell will not bring to us another armor tier - chances to see arena season 4 are very little.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People know how to create good fake items and good fake patch notes. People also know item levels and how to create them, so apart from small glitches, they should look real. <br />

The reason I'm sceptical is quite simple, really: <br />
<br />
Vial of Sunwell - collects 100 HOLY energy...<br />
<br />
Read this:<br />
<br />
<br />
The well's potent ARCANE magic fed and strengthened all high elves on Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Sunwell has nothing to do with holy or divine magic in general. It is firmly an arcane well, similar to Well of Eternity on Mt. Hyjal, except slightly less potent. During the Third War, a portion of that magic escaped, while the remainder was corrupted by Kel'Thuzad's awakening. Kael wanted to reignite the energies of Sunwell using Netherstorm's stored supplies (that was the whole purpose of manaforges). So even if Sunwell was reignited, we'd be talking about an arcane well with a mix of fel in it. Besides, Blood Elves (and High Elves before them) placed main emphasis on arcane energies, suggesting Sunwell's energies would primarily be used by &quot;primary casters&quot;, such as mages and warlocks. Holy magic does not corrupt, Arcane does. Sunwell was arcane, hence High/Blood Elven addiction to magic. It's the core of lore of the elven race. IF those notes are correct, they're waaaaaaay out of line of Warcraft's story.</div></div><hr />

If you don't know that then you probably don't know the lore as well.<br />
As for S4, I doubt there would be such thing before WotLK because it should be a T7 equivalent.</div></div><hr />

The MH-sword is better than anything currently in the game aside from the Warglaives.<br />
The OH-sword is at its current state (for my combat rogue) slightly less dps than Blade of Savagery, mainly due to the weapon-speed of BoS, but still has great stats. Granted dthe 1.5 speed Sword has too much Stamina for my taste and would be great for our MT, but nevertheless a great sword for dps too.<br />
<br />
The Warglaives SET will still be BY FAR the best melee weapons currently in game, even after Sunwell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has nothing to do with &quot;following the lore&quot;. Metzen himself stated that arcane and holy can on their core do the very same deeds, except in a slightly different way. This means arcane can also mend wounds, it's just usually not used that way. If Blizzard wanted to, they could easily keep &quot;Mending the wounds&quot;, all it would be different is the school of magic (arcane instead of holy). As I said, this isn't some backwater demon race you could change to your liking into &quot;holy demons&quot;. The arcane source of Sunwell, the corruption caused by it to elves, the restoration efforts, though, are the heart and soul of not just Burning Crusade, but Frozen Throne as well. Hell, the whole freaking Netherstorm -&gt; Tempest Keep storyline deals with it! Even Illidan story is bound to that same corruption. Sure Blizzard could use that trinket, it's just extremely unlikely, imo. In essence, what I'm saying is, it's possible. I'm just sceptical.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note: from those icons, I recognize Bastion of Light (purple shield). I remember the top left sword (where there are two same ones next to eachother) from somewhere too, just can't place it right now.</div></div><hr />

Why doesn't that cause Holy Damage? <br />
<br />
My point is, it CAN be done. It's just usually NOT done that way. If an item lore-wise suggests something, then it's likely to be used in that way. The only real exception to this was Atiesh and even then we've had several versions of it for each corresponding class.<br />

Offcourse they could've been 'shopped in the screenshot, but that's not very likely.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tufy</div><div class="date">2008-01-23, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zonderpardon, making a new icon for the game is a joke. Hell, even making a new model is perfectly possible, people just can't be arsed. WoW works on a similar principle as previous Blizzard's games, with mpq files serving as &quot;libraries&quot; (akin to zip files) for m2 (models) and blp (skins, icons). To change the icon, you only need to change the corresponding blp file. There's loads of tools floating around to do this. It doesn't even take much time, so one who would want to fake it, would only need to change a few icons with random stuff from god knows where and put it to item objects he changed. Piece of cake to do, especially on a private server.<br />
<br />
As I said, I don't have the explanation for most icons, but that sword looks awfully familiar, no idea from where, though. May be just my mind playing tricks on me and I might be waaay off and this is actually real, of course. :p We won't know until we see the actual PTR or at least confirmed screenie (which won't happen, so PTR it is). Shouldn't take too long anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good thing Illidan's Warblades aren't legendary because they were taken from a mere idiot guard demon.<br />
Oh wait...<br />
<br />
They're Illidan's blades, carried by the Betrayer, the symbol of Demon Hunters (though he technically never was one of them). Hence legendary. Tbh, Gorehowl should be legendary too, Hellscream is a legend.<br />
<br />
Oh, btw., Azzinoth was a doomguard commander, not just some &quot;mere guard demon&quot;. You know, kinda like Kazzak is &quot;a mere guard demon&quot;?</div></div><hr />

For all we know this can be a quest reward for turning in KJ head, say the quest line has the Naaru (holy beings) purify the Sunwell, there is a likely explanation. See the fact stands that you have no clue what happens once we clear the instancec therefore you can not guess at what the lore justifies or not.</div></div><hr />

lmao, lore is good. but I would bet 80-90% (or more) of the people that have a WoW account (even raiders) couldn't answer the simplest question about lore relating to things established in the earlier games.<br />
<br />
Just because I successfully raid and enjoy Wow doesn't mean I know the slightest bit about the lore. I never played any of the earlier games. mostly because I absolutely hate RTS games and never could get into the originals. there are way too many people that assume a &quot;veteran&quot; WoW player memorized all the lore pertaining to it.<br />
<br />
I know how to play my classes, I know what to do with those classes on the various boss fights, I know the math behind the stats I need to stack and where to balance them. but I personally could care less about the lore. wand while some people do enjoy the lore (and thats fine) the lore isn't why I play this game and I know i'm not in the minority about this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. Illidan has legendary glaves that were looted from a doomguard. That's the whole point. It's glaves of Illidan, the symbol of Demon Hunters. As you said, there's plenty of demon hunters around. Who's to say they don't have equally powerful weapons on them? But neither of all those demon hunters is Illidan. You don't get it? Take a look at Sulfuras, the Hand of Ragnaros. Why is that mace so famous? Not because it's powerful. An average green dagger today has more dps. But none of those daggers is the Hand of Ragnaros. Or, let's take an example of Atiesh, the Staff of Medivh:<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22589<br />
<br />
Pretty cool staff, isn't it? Compare to this:<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32374<br />
<br />
Atiesh is legendary, because it was the staff of the Guardian. Yet dps-wise, it can't even hope to compare with some nameless epic from Illidan. So, if the Guardian was obviously more powerful than Illidan, why doesn't the staff reflect it?<br />
<br />
That's my point - the Twin Glaves of Azzinoth will sooner or later be replaced. But even with those tens of new and powerful epics, none of them will be Illidan's glaves. None of them will be spoken of in legends. None of them will be... legendary.<br />
<br />
Yaja:<br />
<br />
You know, it kinda pains me when I see people go &quot;oh, that's orange, NEED!&quot; It's kinda funny. There's a green sword in Halaa sold by a vendor for 8g. Small price, easy to get, best 2h sword before level 70 for retri palas. Yet very few palas get it. Why? &quot;pft, green, that's crap&quot;. That's the actual attitude of people in game. They don't think, they just look at the loot's color and judge everything by that. It's true, Windcape, most people (including you, it seems) don't give a shit about lore. Hell, 99% of my raid doesn't give a shit about lore. Then you go to official forums and see stuff like &quot;gief Drow race!&quot; or something. You know why I started playing this game? Because Blood Mages in Frozen Throne kicked ass. I wanted a high or blood elf mage. There was no High Elves and no elf mages in retail WoW. So I picked a human, believing that one day they would be added. And they were, just on the horde side. And there were people all surprised. &quot;omg, you can't give good elves to evil side!&quot;. To me, it made all the sense in the world even then. Blood Elves were betrayed by Garithos in TFT, then spied on by Night Elves and Dwarves in Burning Crusade. They wanted out, Alliance was out of the question, so Horde was the only logical choice. It made sense. But I wouldn't know this, if I didn't follow the story. You know, see what the hell the Night Elves are doing around, dispose of a certain dwarf, act as an emissary of Silvermoon to Thrall, etc. People go into Netherstorm and grab blues, then they go into Tempest Keep instances and grab epix, then they raid the Eye and eventually, they'll go to Sunwell and grab more epix. In 1 year, what will that help? Those epix will long since be obsolete, their time spent on something passing. This is where story comes in. I walked my Draenei from the crash on Azuremyst, observed the horrors caused by those addicted Blood Elves, saw the race being connected to the Man'ari, walked into Outland and saw the destruction caused by Orcs. Entered Netherstorm, observed the horrors caused by Kael and eventually helped my friends down him. But the story is not done yet, one more chapter is to be written, at Sunwell. On this path, gear is but means to an end.<br />
<br />
In a way, both you and me are playing for fun, but for different reasons. What you are claiming, though, is that my fun doesn't matter, as long as yours gets served. Sadly, my friend, that I have to strongly object. My fun is just as important as yours. Story matters just as much as loot. Without the background, WoW is just another MMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
and I know i'm not in the minority about this.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be so sure. Wow was the largest MMO ever published, the first MMO by Blizzard. For a HUGE number of people, it's the first MMO they ever played. Why? Because WoW would be superior to any game out there? I highly doubt that, I've played a lot of excellent games. WoW has what it takes to make a good game: great story, background, community and gameplay.</div></div><hr />

I understand that Illidan's Warglaves are... well Illidan's. And I'm not sure if it'll surprise you that he's my top fav character in War3 ever since I first saw him and his glaves. But I assure you that this was NOT my point. It all started with that stupid trinket and I was saying was that YES it can be made out of holy energies. I don't know why it's so hard to understand that there can BE one trinket in the sunwell that uses holy!! The Sunwell doesn't impact items, it impacts ppl.</div></div><hr />

In a way, you're right. But, we're talking of a Vial of Sunwell, which was made of a vial of Well of Eternity, which in turn is the very source of arcane on Azeroth. That's why I have a hard time linking that vial to holy energy, that's all there is to it.<br />

Anyway, according to worldofraids, the pic seems semi-confirmed as well, so I guess I'm almost proven wrong.</div></div><hr />

Epics get more item points per item level than greens and blues. Just because your items item level was higher didn't mean it was better.<br />
