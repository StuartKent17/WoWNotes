Theramore's Fall, the first of many Scenarios coming to World of Warcraft, is a story-changing event that will be available to level-85 characters for one week only -- the week leading up to the launch of Mists of Pandaria on September 25.<br />
<br />
For the duration of the week of September 17-24, level-85 characters will be able to queue up for and participate in the Alliance and Horde versions of this new Scenario with two friends. (Please note: if friends are not available to you at the time, two will be provided. Batteries not included. Subject to change. Void where prohibited.)<br />
<br />
After the lifting of the mists, Theramore's Fall will join all other Scenarios as level-90-only content, and everyone -- including players who missed it at level 85 -- will be able to play through the event. Upon completing the Scenario for the first time, players will see the aftermath of the battle whenever visiting Theramore in Dustwallow Marsh. Theramore will eventually be changed permanently to its post-battle state in a future patch, sometime after the launch of Mists of Pandaria, whether or not players have completed the Scenario.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it has been posted yet but does anyone no exactly when the scenario will become available <br />
<br />
Will it be tuesday 12am? like a world event or will it be after maintenance so Wednesday morning in my timezone ...<br />
For US servers it will be unlocked today in the afternoon.</div></div><hr />

This is not a launch event. It's a scenario. They specifically said they chose not to do a launch event for mists because it always ends up being a waste of time just for a week or so worth of content. The theramore scenario gets scaled up so it doesn't become irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

Well, slightly underwhelming, but I did really enjoying kill all those Orc pigs and yelling ''FOR THE ALLIANCE!'', as well as planting Exodar banner on their dead bodies (and then after, Theramore banner). I even got an epic mail helm from the box. Not bad!<br />
<br />
Now, time to make an Alliance raid on my realm, go kill Garrosh and plant the banner on his dead body. FOR THE ALLIANCE! FOR THERAMORE!</div></div><hr />

I get that scenarios are meant to be short, but are they really meant to be so face roll easy that you can ignore the mechanics and succeed using only auto attack?

It's just after 2PM EST here. The Theramore scenario is also locked to my main and gives the &quot;you do not meet the requirements.&quot; My main is level 85 and in a mix of DS 10-man normal and heroic gear. So either they just haven't activated it yet, or it's bugged.</div></div><hr />

Is it really that difficult to realize that scenarios are the replacement for the old &quot;group quest&quot; model? It's not a dungeon. It's meant to be completed by a combo of any 3 characters that join.</div></div><hr />

Let's put this in perspective...<br />
Anyone remember the wrathgate and battle for the undercity chain quest?<br />
How freakin awesome it was, and how everyone thought it was the best thing ever?<br />
Did anyone whine that you could stand by and watch thrall kick the NPCs around, while autoattacking and winning?<br />
Nah, didn't think so, cause people did it to watch the story unfurl.<br />
<br />
Well, the scenarios are meant to recreate that &quot;epic quest that lets you live the story while it happens&quot;. And that's exactly what it does.</div></div><hr />

Loot is random to the point you can sometimes not get any, at all (my first run I just got a couple fireworks).<br />

<br />
Wich does not mean that by giving a scenario meant for lvl 90, as a lvl 85 one for one week isn't the pre-launch event that got in place instead of creating one like the naval battle.<br />
<br />
Just face it. It was crystal clear when they said it. Instead of creating a unique event for pre-launch, they &quot;created&quot; the level 85 version of a scenario that they would use later at 90 for it instead.</div></div><hr />

I would like to point out the fact that this is semantic bullshit.<br />
<br />
It is an event according to the dictionary: noun a thing that happens, especially one of importance according to http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/event.<br />
<br />
The point is that is a &quot;thing&quot; (called the fuck you want it) that happens that changes the things (we just lost an ENTIRE ALLIANCE NATION) around. It introduces us to the story and the occuring changes for our upcoming future.<br />
<br />
Now call it what you want, the truth is it fails at everything it supposed to do.<br />
<br />
It is not epic.<br />
It does not give jack shit worth of lore.<br />
It's not fun.<br />
It's not challenging.<br />
It's pretty much not worth your time.<br />
<br />
So its not an event. Alright. Then even as a scenario its pathetic.</div></div><hr />

Loot is random to the point you can sometimes not get any, at all (my first run I just got a couple fireworks).<br />
<br />
Still, very weak scenario. Was really hoping we'd get to play a bigger role in the battle (as described in ToW). Blizzard, I am disapoint.<br />

Our part as described in &quot;ToW&quot; is sneaking in, sabotating their air support and freeing Thalen. It's 4-5 lines.</div></div><hr />

Yea, at least the Horde group's role does appear in the book (the infiltration party that freed the elf dude), the alliance actually goes against the events described in the book. Was really hoping for something a tad better, like participating in the siege or something. Oh well..</div></div><hr />

So its not an event. Alright. Then even as a scenario its pathetic.<br />
&quot; It's not epic &quot;<br />
It's a scenario, designed for 3 people. <br />
<br />
&quot; No lore &quot;<br />
What instance has ever contained a lot of lore? Go on name 5 in the entire time you've been playing WoW. Unless you count like 8 words in a quest text &quot; great lore &quot; then I doubt you'll be able to come up with 5 examples of instances full of great lore. Maybe some minor lore, but great? I doubt it. I can admit it would of been better to have something but I doubt some 5 minute scenario could tell a convincing story. <br />
<br />
&quot; It's not fun &quot; <br />
This I can agree with. It was some what fun the first time, boring as hell the second time. <br />
<br />
&quot; It's not challenging &quot;<br />
What do you expect? It's a bloody scenario, no where did Blizzard ever say Scenario's were going to be super difficult. How can you make something difficult for 3 people in a game which is dependant upon the holy trinity?<br />
<br />
But as I said it's only a scenario just calm down and deal with it. I never had high hopes for something that's designed for 3 people. Could a world event of been better? Yes it really could, however Blizzard said recently that they considered a two week naval battle leading into mists but opted to use that time to work further on mists. If it makes mists better overall not to have a world event then fine I can accept this.</div></div><hr />

I get that scenarios are meant to be short, but are they really meant to be so face roll easy that you can ignore the mechanics and succeed using only auto attack? I just hope that this has been deliberately under tuned for level 85 and that the level 90 versions will actually be a bit more difficult.<br />

It sounds rather like those seasonal bosses - in difficulty and the lack of a lock out. But with those, I think they limited the rewards. I guess they want to help people gear up for MoP now.</div></div><hr />

I know that's what they were meant to be, but this scenario is so easy that even low level solo quests offer more of a challenge. Back in the day group quests, especially elite group quests were actually hard if done at the intended level. So this scenario is in no way an adequate replacement for group quests.

I rather like the look of the tabard, but unfortunately I am horde and get the little bomb thing. Tradesies? <br />

But really, why not give alliance and horde both the tabard and mini bomb? Say that the alliance found a scrap piece of the bomb in the aftermath and say horde stole the tabard off the body of a guard.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, maybe if you were soloing them, though quite a few classes were capable of soloing elite group quests at or below level.<br />

I'm not fine with it being the pre-launch event (I know it's not officially an event yada yada. Get real. People were expecting to see one, and this is all we get). <br />
<br />
I'm also totally not fine (at least from horde perspective) that I took such a passive role in destroying Theramore. I rigged some barrels, killed few people that I did not know or care, rigged some tanks and helped a dude escape, and sat back and watched a meh quality cinematic that destroyed theramore <br />

This is an online game, and I want to feel like what I do matters. I'm not paying to see a movie, I'm paying to play in a fantasy world. I'm very disappointed with this, sadly. I hope MoP turns out to be better than this.</div></div><hr />

It's a scenario, designed for 3 people. <br />
<br />
&quot; No lore &quot;<br />
What instance has ever contained a lot of lore? Go on name 5 in the entire time you've been playing WoW. Unless you count like 8 words in a quest text &quot; great lore &quot; then I doubt you'll be able to come up with 5 examples of instances full of great lore. Maybe some minor lore, but great? I doubt it. I can admit it would of been better to have something but I doubt some 5 minute scenario could tell a convincing story. <br />
<br />
&quot; It's not fun &quot; <br />
This I can agree with. It was some what fun the first time, boring as hell the second time. <br />
<br />
&quot; It's not challenging &quot;<br />
What do you expect? It's a bloody scenario, no where did Blizzard ever say Scenario's were going to be super difficult. How can you make something difficult for 3 people in a game which is dependant upon the holy trinity?<br />
<br />
But as I said it's only a scenario just calm down and deal with it. I never had high hopes for something that's designed for 3 people. Could a world event of been better? Yes it really could, however Blizzard said recently that they considered a two week naval battle leading into mists but opted to use that time to work further on mists. If it makes mists better overall not to have a world event then fine I can accept this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Instances with more lore in them...<br />
<br />
Halls of Stone (The history of the curse of flesh)<br />
<br />
Halls of Lightning (The story of Loken)<br />
<br />
Shadowfang Keep (Arugal story)<br />
<br />
Pit of Saron and Frozen Halls ICC instances with the Arthas role.<br />
<br />
There you go five instances off the top of my head with more lore in them.<br />
<br />
Whatever. Im done arguing about this.<br />
<br />

Two of the three events were abysmal at best and tuned similarly but just not the &quot;new&quot; scenario. This scenario may be boring. But aside from Tenris and zombies in sanctuary areas, I just didn't find wotlk event that great either. I personally didn't mind the zombie attack, hell I wish they would bring back random world boss attacks as well.<br />
<br />
I wish people would just list the great moments from the Wrath event they LOVED so much that did not involve someone else's grief. Instead of just saying &quot;worst ever&quot;. I am not saying there are none. There should be plenty (if not an overflowing cornucopia) of stories judging by the responses in here. Take those stories and say here Blizz this is the type of thing I really wanted for &quot;one week only&quot; before every expansion.<br />
<br />
Face it, the unexpected things that came out of the Wrath event is what made it cool. As long as you were hearing funny stories from OTHER people being griefed (or doing the griefing) then users were cool with it. Didn't bother me. Zombies running around a city is not normal. Yes, it was cool. But challenging, rewarding, lore-filled?<br />
<br />
Would you prefer the grind for tokens for crap gear method? Just like dailies. The Lich out in the world for the wrath event had plenty of lil tokens for ya? My guess is give players something just to pass the time until MOP comes out. <br />
<br />
Having said all that I do think Blizz made a bit of a mistake releasing this before MOP. It was IMO, a &quot;Well, we gotta give them something&quot; deal.</div></div><hr />

You get Loot (in your bag under Theramore stash) &amp; JP also works on your team building skills, and your own personal survivability depending on group configuration etc. Gives you a bit of a personal feel whilst doing the scenario, adds a little lore (: I quite like it, it's something to do.</div></div><hr />

MoP focuses more in the environment, this is what the scenario is for. A short blast, where you have a chance to get a purple out of without the need of much complications as forming a full group. So a scenario is more like short even bosses like the hallow's boss without a tank or healer. Theramore is going to change, is going to be a world battlefield hub.

<br />
It isn't WoW that died, more the certain people playing it who are now brain dead to the point they misinform others due to their own stupidity of not being able to understand simple concepts (such as the ones stated constantly on difficulty and length of Scenarios). It is due to the people who think they are above the developers intelligence-wise that WoW was losing subscribers due to those 'elitists' (if you can even call them that) bad-mouthing the game. <br />
<br />
Notice I say was losing subscribers, as I have faith in the fact that Blizzard, compromised of brilliant storytellers, great business strategists, and some of the best game designers in gaming, will have learnt from their past mistakes and will continue to excel in the making of one of, if not the, best video games ever created. I also have faith that the WoW Gamer base will be able to in time stop constantly complaining about every new content patch that arrives, although this can be attributed to the fact that WoW started out so great and has been getting better at such a great pace that people have become spoilt by the great quality that Blizzard has been producing over the years, and the slightest slip up to this fast increasing game quality has caused people to pout and whine over a slight (and by slight I mean very minuscule) leveling out of that ascending quality of the game. <br />
<br />
Blizzard know what happened with Cataclysm and they know why people weren't as satisfied with the content, and that is why for Mists of Pandaria they shall be capitalizing on their previous errors and shall resume that previous ascension of great game quality, and from the looks of it, they'll be doing it at a much faster pace. I am extremely excited for the next couple of years as I now know that Blizzard are much more aware and careful of what decisions they choose to make, and how to execute them. The games itself has never gone down in quality, its just the players are demanding a much greater amount of it, and once again, it can be safely said that Blizzard are aware of this, and will be delivering just that for this coming expansion and those to come.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lvlark</div><div class="date">2012-09-17, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I knew it was going to be easy, I mean all 3 of us were 390+ ilvl AND it's meant to be quite doable without tank/healer. But this is a bit undertuned still tbh. No need to look for who's where, which mob is the strongest or anything cos they go down as soon as you look at them.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to the main problem: It's just all so short! The story doesn't come alive or anything, nor is there enough dialogue.<br />
I'd very much like the idea of a scenario where you needn't worry about how well you perform, but where you can just indulge in the story. Theramore is the first, but not the second. And its extreme ease makes that even worse.<br />
<br />
If it's a good story, told in a decent fashion, I'll keep coming back to it. I spammed the ICC 5mans months after I was done with collecting gear, just because they were so awesome, especially... I digress.<br />
<br />
What I'm trying to say is: Blizz should make Scenario's like those dungeons, but easier (there's a place and time for easy content just as well as challenging content). Bosses could have so much health that they take 5 minutes to kill, as long as they don't do alot of damage. Then they would really have something, Theramore right now is just.. meh.</div></div><hr />

Even better, if you are one of the few players with an ilvl between 353 - 360 you are bound to be paired with two 390-410 players, and therefore will be carried anyway.<br />
<br />
Why not design this event for ilvl 393 and reach the majority of players instead? If I remember correctly there were epic 420 weapons for lvl 85 and it was assumed they will accompany the modified Theramore event. Something might have changed their minds and I wonder what.</div></div><hr />

No, they ARE just queueable group quests! They are mainly for story progression. A blue described them like this:<br />

Except that for my taste, they're too fast cos of ease (as I said, stuff needs to live longer, but no need for stuff to do much damage), and, partly because of that, there isn't enough story to take away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is my biggest gripe - I turned my sound and music on just for the scenario, I think the only thing I heard was the elf at the end when I was handing it in - if they're going for scenarios being story delivery, I think a bit more dialogue is needed - even if it's not voiced.<br />
<br />
I entered and got no dialogue - just a quest to blow some ships up.<br />
I told a goblin I had done that.<br />
I then told a blood elf that I wasn't going to free him, was surprised and entertained to get an amusing retort, then freed him - got some more nice dialogue and a sweet cutscene.<br />
<br />
A voiced intro or some periodic dialogue, text or voice between objectives would have added a lot.</div></div><hr />

I just wanted an awesome story-driven &quot;instance&quot;.<br />
With small cutscenes, characters that I knew going around being nice.<br />
The story was shit on Horde side, anyway... I really did not get a clue of why/how the Horde had suddenly got hold of the Theramore docks... There was 1 Horde ship and 6(?) Alliance ships...<br />
I also wonder what the Theramore army was doing, until the ships blew up.<br />
&quot;Oh well, it's game-mechanics!&quot;, oh well, it's boring then. I wanted something simulating war! I didn't get that, I don't know why I expected it... (Wet dreams)<br />

<br />
1. It's not a World &quot;event&quot;, as we used to have them before.. btw. I remember very very well the bitching orgy about how lame the Cata events have been.. <br />
This time we don't have any event.<br />
<br />
2. What we got is nothing but a sneak peek into a new feature, which we get to do more once MOP comes out. And once that's the case we will have more satisfaction from the scenarios, given we do them at the appropriate time of the progress they are meant for.<br />
<br />
3. Challenging.. NEVER was any of the launch events challenging, nor ever was any of the holiday bosses, with which it can be compared best. <br />
For challenges we getting challenge modes, and those will always be challenging, even when we outgear them, because they do scaling and brings us down to an approriate level of gear. <br />
<br />
Take it for exactly that. A sneak peek.... Not more, not less.<br />
<br />
The question whether we would have wanted a different kind of &quot;launch event&quot; is a whole other story.</div></div><hr />

What you got was a sample taste of scenarios, i.e instanced 3man quests, and to witness the first event leading to the war in Pandaria.<br />
That's it. Oh, and a nice way to cap Justice. And get some misc items.<br />
<br />
The 85 version lasts merely a week, so it's just a little bonus while we wait for the 25th.<br />

People need to calm the hell down and realize that Theramore is in no way shape or form comparable to the disruptive zombie event, because it's not even trying to be.</div></div><hr />

I have forgiven the terrible lazy TOC patch, i have forgiven the (again) lazy Dragon Soul patch, but i'm surely completely worn out of content that comes out and i just say &quot;meh...&quot;<br />

This was again another example of what lazyness is going on in blizzard for a long long time. What wrong with you, realy? the lore has amazing potential, your graphical engine (while dated) is capable of much more grandious things, then why such lame things come out ? <br />

I think the issue is that they (or at least the theramore one) deliver as much (if not less) story than even a standard quest. Blizzard have said they were going to be story telling mechanics, which I like - but they said that about archaeology - both seem to have failed in that regard.<br />
<br />
I don't mind them being trivial and requiring no effort, but I'd like to get SOMETHING out of them - and they're not delivering in the story department.</div></div><hr />

I have forgiven the terrible lazy TOC patch, i have forgiven the (again) lazy Dragon Soul patch, but i'm surely completely worn out of content that comes out and i just say &quot;meh...&quot;<br />
<br />
This was again another example of what lazyness is going on in blizzard for a long long time. What wrong with you, realy? the lore has amazing potential, your graphical engine (while dated) is capable of much more grandious things, then why such lame things come out ? <br />
<br />
Honestly, sigh for you blizzard!<br />
<br />
AMEN ! <br />
<br />
Could not agree more with you !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Halls of Lightning (The story of Loken)<br />
<br />
Shadowfang Keep (Arugal story)<br />
<br />
Pit of Saron and Frozen Halls ICC instances with the Arthas role.<br />
<br />
There you go five instances off the top of my head with more lore in them.<br />
<br />
Whatever. Im done arguing about this.<br />
<br />
It was cheap and shit. And the &quot;they invested resources in Panda&quot; crap is bollocks. Think what you want. Point is this is crap and cheap. <br />
Except those dungeons never told the story, they merely gave us the chance to kill them. The true story was told throughout the zones you quested through. <br />
<br />
Halls of Stone and Lokens story began in Howling Fjord and continued in Grizzly Hills and Finally Storm Peaks.<br />
<br />
Arugals was told in Silverpine forest, though not very good as vanilla storytelling wasn't at it's greatest.<br />
<br />
The IC 5 Mans? Yeah right, Arthas showed up in one, what story did that tell us? Nothing that those of who played WC3 and read novels didn't already know. Or how about? Thou must vanquish him upon the throne! Clearly not overused right?<br />
<br />
Seriously just calm the fuck down it's a game, you're acting as if someone came and beat the crap out of you irl. I'm sure there's a lot of people who are disappointed (I am) but there's also a lot of people who are taking this wayyyyyyyyy to serious, you are one of those people along with the others who cannot remove their heads from their backsides and realise this was -NOT- a pre mop event. And for the record you cannot disprove what ghostcrawler said about investing the resources into mists, you're simply on an emo rampage.<br />
<br />
Which would make it a colossal waste of time trying to reason with you. I'll come back when you're out of this RAWRRRR SMASH attitude of yours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do you think on the Diablo BETA you could only play up to the Skeleton King?<br />
Why do you think that they didn't put this on the PTR?<br />
<br />
The answer is that because the player base would see how shitty it is and actually start to look at other products. Blizzard has been able to feed us mindless bullshit for the past 4-5years because of the lack of overall choice in a MMO. While no other MMO will be able to overtake WoW. Each one is doing a small dent, and over the course of time those dents are going to, and starting to, add up. If they want to fix those dents they need to be putting out content that is quality and at a faster rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't really blame em though they have legitimate reasons. This scenario is garbage, plain and simple. <br />
<br />
Why have they even bothered adding the new scenario feature if they are going to be that bad? it's just making the game worse adding mediocre features that aren't enjoyable. I get they aren't dungeons or even supposed to be challenging that doesn't mean they can't actually be good, they are showing a new MoP feature while also promoting the new expansion and this is what we get? underwhelmed is a polite way of putting it.</div></div><hr />

Its not and they spesificly stated they are not making anything special this time its just a way to get a FoS and a item. Just keeping on with the tradition of giving players something before a exp pack goes live.</div></div><hr />

Wait, you got 3 bits? I'm jealous.<br />
<br />
It's not that it's a bad pre-launch event.<br />
<br />
It's just bad.<br />
<br />
It fails to deliver lore, which was it's prime objective. Even without looking at it as an opening event, it still doesn't stand if it can't deliver on the one thing it was made to do.<br />
<br />
I can only hope the other scenarios have some dialogue / lore in them somewhere and this is the black sheep of the bunch.</div></div><hr />
