Venturebeat (https://venturebeat.com/) sat down with J. Allen Brack to discuss Blizzard, WoW over the past 15 years, and the future. Here is a summary, and be sure to read the full interview here (https://venturebeat.com/2019/05/14/blizzard-boss-j-allen-brack-world-of-warcrafts-past-future-and-his-hectic-start/)<br />

<br />
<br />
J. Allen Brack has played all Blizzard franchises and is a true fan of everything the company does, and Warcraft is close to his heart because it is the franchise he has worked the longest on and played the most.<br />
When World of Warcraft launched, the company had 300 employees. Today they have 4,300.<br />
World of Warcraft's success allowed the company to do many different and amazing things and it's hard to imagine the size and scope and scale of some of their games without World of Warcraft.<br />
The team started discussing what to do for the 15th anniversary about 2 yeard ago and wanted to do something broader than the 10th anniversary statue.<br />
Brack sees classic as part of the World of Warcraft pillar and not its own new pillar.<br />
J. Allen Brack's transition into president of Blizzard has been challenging, but the most important piece is what the teams are working on and the future of the franchises. The company currently has more games being worked on now than at any other time in Blizzard's history, and they believe in the future of their franchises.<br />
There isn't a requirement that every game created by Blizzard work and speak to every single player. Their goal is to get you to try new things and give them a chance while still providing a good, authentic Blizzard experience.<br />
Blizzard loved working on Diablo III for the switch and think both Nintendo and the console are great.<br />
It's not ridiculous to assume that Blizzard could work with Nintendo on other projects.<br />
Some of Brack's best WoW experiences are beating Ragnaros and Kael'thas as a guild for the first time, or completing the Undying achievement from Naxxramas 10-man.<br />
Creating the Legion expansion was one of his favorite highlights working on WoW. Bringing back Illidan and having diffrent artifact weapons and the world quest system and playing it after it was done is an awesome memory.<br />
Brack agrees that Mists of Pandaria was one of the most misunderstood expansions that now is looked back on fondly. <br />
The team for a long time wanted to have a class or a race where you chose whether you went Horde or Alliance, and it was cool to be able to do that in Mists of Pandaria.<br />
Brack believes people will have their favorite expansion depending on when they joined, who their friends were at the time, and what different content they experienced.<br />
The team believes the two-year expansion cycle with three major content patches is the right thing right now.<br />
The big inflection this year is going to be Classic. It's a huge piece that's going to be midway through the cycle. <br />
The team is always open to thinking about different things that they could have done or could do, and what is the right thing from a development standpoint.<br />
The team did think about making Argus its own expansion, but think the way that they ended up doing it turned out pretty good.<br />

actually doing the daily i didn't mind because after 1 month it was all over but i hated the fact that they nerfed it and made it easier later in the expansion and all my work/grind was for nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah I didnt mind the dailies either. The shado-pan stuff with an ally you could choose was more interesting than looting nuts for the 15th time with a world quest and the end goal was more clear rather than endless RNG with the paragon cache</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually such factors have a huge impact on how enjoyable a game is for many people. Having a good friendly guild can make or break any expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For many people it wasn't the fact there was a month long grind, it was that if you wanted to be somewhat competitive you were forced to grind every faction's dailys every day until you had all the things you needed. So for raiders you were forced to basically login and do 2-3 hours of dailys every single day, before you could do anything else and for many people that was the only time they had to play so they basically logged in to a new expansion and did dailys for the first month or so and none of the other new content.<br />
<br />
Though I do agree about the paragon cache, they need a change for badluck protection or outright removed. It's healthy to finish things, unending grinds become unrewarding and unsatisfying.</div></div><hr />

It's always the little things that makes things more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This 100%, hit the nail on the head, it's part of the reason i quit shortly after ToT came out it was not fun to be forced to login every day to do your round of dailies just to be able to raid with some of the BiS pre raid gear being locked behind exalted rep status on a few factions was moronic, and if you were going for a server first you were forced to also do it all on alts too in order to negate the sweeping nerfs and changes blizz made in the first 'balance' pass they made shortly before Christmas that year.<br />
<br />
I agree wholeheartedly that they need to stop adding endless grind shite to the game and have content that has a stopping point, part of the reason the 'original' paragon trait in the artifact weapons was so good (relative to what was added later) was because once you had grinded your way to 52 traits you were done, and any excess AP gains could be used on off spec weapons to get them to the same point and once finished you could then choose what content you wanted to play and weren't forced into one single form of content that you may not have enjoyed doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
..... Such a pointless comment. I wonder if you realize this game has millions of players with millions of different opinions (most of which don't waste their time on forums bitching about said game).<br />
<br />
<br />
You may not have enjoyed Expansion X but I guarantee you there are hundreds of thousands that did/currently do enjoy it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Me personally, I think BfA is fantastic. My main class (monk) is good, all 3 specs are fun to play. My survival hunter alt is fun. My shaman is fun. Azerite gear is in a great spot right now. The content I personally care about (End game PvE) is as good as it has ever been. Plus there is 8.2 coming soon which looks incredible.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course thats just my opinion. Your free to hate the game if you wish. However, don't pretend like the game &quot;isn't enjoyable&quot; to everyone.</div></div><hr />

I think Brack is even in same hate level like EA CEO ATM. I know he is only Blizz president, but ya know what i mean. Also i start to feel that his. &quot;You think you do, but you don't&quot; stops working, seeing how beta classic was recieved by fans. But it is still long road, before we can say it is success or not.<br />
<br />
Also Brack instead of puting out current fires in all blizz games, is adding it more. Vulpine Familiar mount was one of those fires.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But on the other hand, its hard to have friends or a guild to play with when everyone quits because the content is boring and repetitive. We had our local guild burnout towards the end of WoD, only a skeleton crew returned for Legion but enough to have fun with keystones, and pretty much everyone skipped BFA. It's hard to justify the monthly cost/gold grind when you're just waiting for timers constantly, and 6 months between content is a long time.</div></div><hr />

Hey moron, 4300 people working on 8 IPs and upcoming projects, a lot more PR, CS, Esports. Sure they all most have worked on BFA. Who can take this kind of logic serious?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally didn’t like MoP but hear it was good. I didn’t stick around for it, I didn’t enjoy the theme of pandaland and I wouldn’t have raided my own capital. Team garrosh. <br />
<br />
Diehard wow fan; I’ve driven 3000 miles twice to blizzcon (05 and 09) but I don’t think the right people are in place at the company. It seems to have become more corporate and less gamer friendly over the years and there’s no turning that ship around<br />

This is the biggest issue I have with current WoW, a slave to a timetable guarantees that we end up with sub par expansions.<br />

<br />
My last &quot;I quit&quot; was because of MoP. Looking back, that was a terrible decision, because all facts point in one direction: PvP (which is my focus) was great, and so was PvE apparently.<br />
<br />
Personally, while I kept my opinion to myself, pandas just feel off for the World of Warcraft. And frankly, they still do. I am saying this having spent the majority of Season 1 BFA maining a Pandaren Warrior.<br />
<br />
That said, as I leveled my monk during Legion and discovered the Monk class hall and other tidbits from MoP, I realized that whoever was on the art team back then, really did, 100% enjoy their job—creating a Chinese culture-influenced world. Just look at the Monk Class Hall. It's gigantic and full of flavor!<br />
<br />
But yeah, this is simply me giving you an idea of the why and who.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fairness, they were once aiming for an expansion a year, which would have been too much.<br />
<br />
Though, when I played BFA I was left with the opinion that they should have done another content patch or two in Legion and pushed BFA back. I also disagree about Argus and think they should have made it its own expansion that the artifact weapons carried over into. <br />
<br />
I think my thoughts can be summarized as Legion was so good that while BFA isn't terrible, it just doesn't hit the same bar that Legion did.</div></div><hr />

No it definitely factors in. <br />
A lot of people who started in cata loved it personally i think it was garbage since most of dev time was put into remaking the world instead of making end game content. But to each their own.<br />
Playing a mmo by yourself is definitely not the greatest experience. Might as well be playing a actual single player focused game instead. Looking at wow its not hard to think of reasons why that might be the case... &gt;_&lt; outside of the fact its depressing.</div></div><hr />

5-6 months between major content patches has been the norm since forever. Even in Legion. The only difference in Legion was that they had the patches and raids on a different cycle, ie. the raid was delayed from the patch launch.<br />
<br />
But in recent years this isn't &quot;enough&quot; anymore, apparently, while everyone praises the old expansions where this was just standard.</div></div><hr />

I've always said Blizzard is too slow with content releases from day one. Its the MO. They always seem to have these huge patches and can't release anything major in between.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. This is one of the biggest mistakes WoW has ever made. Turning the finale of the Burning Legion, something that had been built up for well over a decade into 3 Blades Edge style zones was worse than anything that came from WoD.</div></div><hr />

And yet if you look at 3/4 of the posts in the classic forum it's all about how classic should be changed. Many of those from people who were pushing for Classic before the announcement. Not to mention complaints about things in beta which Blizzard had to put out multiple &quot;These are not bugs.&quot; posts is showing for many that the line is extremely accurate.</div></div><hr />

He should have phrased that better. It wasn’t even that he was wrong, it’s how horribly he communicated the message.<br />
<br />
<br />
(And for those thinking he WAS wrong, I urge you to read ANY classic thread and count the amount of comments asking for classic-specific expansions, or other things that are literally the opposite of classic. “I want vanilla however I don’t want vanilla, I want wow to restart at vanilla and then abandon it for new content after a year” is NOT wanting vanilla.)</div></div><hr />

If you have a game that has a bad perception, then the meta for a lot of people becomes &quot;play something else.&quot; When people are playing something else, there is a lot less of a chance that old group of friends will decide to spend time in the game, ect.<br />
<br />
We can't really tell if any game is good or bad because these things come down to individual opinion. My opinion is that BFA is the worst xpak, and Legion is the best.<br />
<br />
However, it is the marketing teams responsibility to react to the audience and ensure that the perception of the game is as positive as possible. This is the reality of gaas.<br />
<br />
For years, you may have heard some developers talk about how you don't want what you think you want, ect. They may talk about not listening to fans and how that helps the overall game.<br />
<br />
These things are all pretty true on a single player game. However, gaas games need developer feedback. The community needs to feel as though they are partners with the developers, not at odds with them. They need to be catered to. That is the ugliness of modern gaas, and WoW is not immune.<br />
<br />
I think it is too late for BFA, but in the next Xpak Blizzard should look more into damage control, especially early on. They should fight for their audience, and speak for them, instead of providing insightful and well thought out reasons for why they are wrong. Give them what they want.<br />

What about turning the Emerald Dream into a forgettable launch raid. That was my dream xpak!<br />

That said, despite it all, Legion is about a million times better than BFA.</div></div><hr />

No raid pre no lights Yogg was tough. Especially by todays standard. Put any and all normal mode boss in Vanilla and people would end up screaming because they wouldn't be able to handle the mechanics back then. Let alone heroic or Mythic.</div></div><hr />

This is the most common bullshit I hear :D I bet you didn't even play on Vanila. Just heard some stuff from Youtube :D <br />
Nonetheless, I love when people compare the difficulty purely on the mechanics perspective, ignoring the idea that people had no clue how to play this game back then, which is crucial to fairly assess it's difficulty.</div></div><hr />

Just like BFA.<br />

<br />
But on the other hand, its hard to have friends or a guild to play with when everyone quits because the content is boring and repetitive. We had our local guild burnout towards the end of WoD, only a skeleton crew returned for Legion but enough to have fun with keystones, and pretty much everyone skipped BFA. It's hard to justify the monthly cost/gold grind when you're just waiting for timers constantly, and 6 months between content is a long time.<br />
<br />
If you find RPGs boring and repetitive, Fortnite might be more your speed.<br />

<br />
Given that World of Warcraft was made with 300 employees and this expansion with... 4,300... I know time is a factor... but like... wow...<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I'd be super excited if Blizzard and Nintendo revisited some of the old Blizzard IPs from that era. I'd so be down for a modern Lost Vikings, Rock n' roll racing or Blackthorne.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can tell school is out for summer when you see comments like this.<br />
<br />
Blizzard makes more games than WoW. BFA was not made by 4,300 people.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
In fairness, they were once aiming for an expansion a year, which would have been too much.<br />
<br />
Though, when I played BFA I was left with the opinion that they should have done another content patch or two in Legion and pushed BFA back. I also disagree about Argus and think they should have made it its own expansion that the artifact weapons carried over into. <br />
<br />
I think my thoughts can be summarized as Legion was so good that while BFA isn't terrible, it just doesn't hit the same bar that Legion did.<br />
<br />
To be fair, the people complaining about the 6 month patch schedule are doing so because they do LFR once and then have nothing to do for the next 5 months.<br />
<br />
Upsetting these players is fine. We're all better off when they go back to playing Fortnite.<br />

<br />
Relative toughness is the only metric that matters. Sure, all the old bosses are too easy today and all the new bosses would be too hard back then... but that's because a.) we've built up tools like DBM and WA that we didn't have back then (or the ability to accurately measure damage, even) and b.) because people have learned when X do Y type patterns that were entirely new back then and c.) class homogenization means most classes have most of the tools so you can have stuff like a raid-wide damage burst. In classic this just would have killed 2/3rds of the raid who had no way of reducing it, for example.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure he deleted it because he couldn't use both trinkets, so instead of farming for another he's rerolling. You know, like people did in Legion for legendaries.</div></div><hr />

Wait what? I'm not going to be a dick but re-read what you just typed. If you're really looking to use your brain you should play a moba or like...become a game developer and fix this alleged issue for Blizzard. I don't think a tedious grind requires wit.</div></div><hr />
