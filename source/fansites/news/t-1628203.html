Opening Ceremony<br />
<br />
Overwatch confirmed as new IP, playable at Blizzcon and &quot;sooner than you think&quot;. Team shooter set in the future on earth. 12 Heroes now, many more coming in the future.<br />
New Hearthstone expansion - Goblins and Gnomes<br />
Heroes of the Storm closed beta begins January 13, 2015<br />
SC2: Legacy of the Void was announced, along with Archon mode, Allied Commanders mode, automated tournaments, and more.<br />
The spacegoat pet (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/august/spacegoatLiterallyASpacegoat.jpg?1) will be sold starting in December (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/348546-coming-soon-adopt-a-pet-for-charity/) to support the Red Cross's Ebola relief efforts.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/july/wowmini.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:-2px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom&quot; /&gt; World of Warcraft<br />
<br />
Warcraft Movie Presentation (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4485-Warcraft-Movie-Presentation)<br />
<br />
People actually at Blizzcon saw a short teaser trailer, but the video won't be released online (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/530887786233348096).<br />
The movie will follow heroes on both factions, &quot;50% Alliance, 50% Horde&quot;.<br />
The visual effects are very realistic. Motion capture was used, the team worked with ILM to make it feel as much like live action as possible.<br />
Effects are Avatar and Lord of the Rings at the same time.<br />
Very detailed sets were built, such as part of Stormwind's main street.<br />
A partial list of the cast was released.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft - Items, Class Changes, and More (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4486-World-of-Warcraft-Items-Class-Changes-and-More)<br />
<br />
A recap of Warlords changes.<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Cinematic Intro Panel (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4493-Warlords-of-Draenor-Cinematic-Intro-Panel)<br />
<br />
Blizzard has a new group called The Forge that will be focused on telling stories in the Blizzard universe.<br />
In one cinematic idea, Chromie could have a vision of what is happening in Draenor as a flashback.<br />
The team uses live video references to create the cinematic shots.<br />
The silhouette of the Warlords was mostly done by using existing assets, as the models of the Warlords models weren't done.<br />
Sin City was the original art style reference for Lords of War.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Q + A Panel (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4496-World-of-Warcraft-Q-A-Panel) - (Notes have been cleaned up from the live recap)<br />
<br />
Farahlon may or may not make it into a content patch. The team isn't sure yet, which is why it was removed from the map. At one point they considered using it as a separate area for boosted players, but Tanaan Jungle for everyone felt like the better choice.<br />
The team can make one click milling and prospecting if it is something players want.<br />
Social content like AQ gates opening is great, but it crashed the servers. One person being a hero and representing the server is something cool that can be done.<br />
New armor designs and silhouettes is something the team is talking about. They are drawing it up and coming with ideas. No solid release date yet.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: Looking for Group Documentary (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4497-World-of-Warcraft-Looking-for-Group-Documentary)<br />
<br />
If you are interested in WoW, you should watch this. A recap won't do it justice (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1627920-World-of-Warcraft-Looking-for-Group-Documentary?p=30505860&amp;viewfull=1#post30505860). <br />

<br />
Overwatch Unveiled (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4481-Overwatch-Unveiled)<br />
<br />
Chris Metzen is only doing one voice in this game.<br />
The game will be accessible and have options other than putting a crosshair over someone.<br />
You should die less frequently than in current modern military shooters.<br />
Initially only on PC.<br />
No pricing model yet.<br />
<br />
Overwatch Press Kit (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4482-Overwatch-Press-Kit)<br />
<br />
Cinematic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqnKB22pOC0&amp;feature=player_embedded) and Gameplay (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dushZybUYnM&amp;feature=player_embedded) trailers released, along with videos of each hero's skills on the website (http://us.battle.net/overwatch/en/).<br />
Lots of art and screenshots.<br />
<br />
Overwatch - Origins (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4491-Overwatch-Origins)<br />
<br />
Overwatch uses a new engine with new technology.<br />
Warcraft started out very simple and then added in new characters, story, and art over time. Overwatch is starting from the same place, a simple beginning and lots of potential for the future in terms of story and characters.<br />
The team wanted Tracer to be the centerpiece hero, as everyone on the team loved her.<br />
No real answer to if there will be collectable hats.<br />
The game has some similarities to TF2, but it is still a very different game. TF2 has a limited number of roles with some more customization through weapon choices. Overwatch also has some more mobility, with some heroes that can fly or use grapple hooks. Overwatch is more about hero abilities than it is about putting a crosshair over the other heroes. <br />

<br />
Hearthstone: Fireside Chat (http://www.hearthpwn.com/news/675-blizzcon-2014-new-expansion-announced-goblins-vs)<br />
<br />
The Goblins and Gnomes expansion is launching December 2014. It has 120 cards and spectator mode for friends.<br />
A portion of the new cards have been released and are on Hearthpwn (http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards?display=3&amp;filter-set=101&amp;filter-unreleased=1).<br />
The Goblins vs Gnomes trailer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijyMZPIsj5E) was released.<br />
The expansion comes with a new game board (http://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/attachments/6/728/goblins_vs_gnomes_gameboard.png).<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/october/hotsIcon.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:-2px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom&quot; /&gt; Heroes of the Storm<br />
<br />
Heroes of the Storm Overview (http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1238-blizzcon-2014-heroes-panel-live-update)<br />
<br />
Draft mode is coming, with no duplicate heroes and no bans.<br />
Ranked play is coming with two leagues: Hero league (any size group queue) and Team league (fixed size teams only). There are seasons, points, and a separate skill rank. <br />
Leavers - If you leave games too often, you will only be matched with other people that leave games too often. You can undo this by not leaving games.<br />
<br />
Sound of the Nexus (http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1239-blizzcon-2014-sound-of-the-nexus-panel-recap)<br />
<br />
Back in Warcraft III, the average lines a unit spoke was just 20. For Heroes, its 300! <br />
Chain Lightning was created with fireworks, and a tape measure.<br />
<br />
Heroes of the Storm Deep Dive (http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1240-blizzcon-2014-heroes-of-the-storm-deep-dive)<br />
<br />
There should be a core, awesome mechanic for each battleground. Changes the flow of gameplay.<br />
Sky Temple takes place in a brand new universe, never before seen in another Blizzard game.<br />
Tomb of the Spider Queen takes place in the save universe as sky temple. Is an interior battleground, the first one! It's spooky.<br />
<br />
Heroes Developer Interview (http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1241-blizzcon-heroes-developer-interview-with-kaeo)<br />
<br />
Lost Vikings are the first Insane Difficulty hero.<br />
Bounties, part of the kill streak system, are still on the list of things to do.<br />
No current plans for any story mode stuff like Starcraft campaigns.<br />
The Heroes development team is Team 1, the same team which creates Starcraft II. They're currently working on Legacy of the Void and Heroes at the same time.<br />
Both games have dedicated content designers, and artists, but share some systems people. People move around a bunch, but there's normally 100 people working on Heroes.<br />
<br />

BlizzCon Costume Contest Winner<br />
If you were watching the amazing costumes on the stream last night, you may have noticed that the winner never appeared during the contest. GeekyRed (https://twitter.com/GeekyRed) shared a picture of the complete costume that won.<br />

Overwatch Cosplay<br />
Even though Overwatch was a secret, Blizzard had some costumes ready ahead of time and took a fun 360 degree picture with them.<br />

Coming Soon: Adopt a Pet for Charity<br />
A new pet to support Ebola relief efforts is coming next month.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/august/thumb/spacegoatLiterallyASpacegoat.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/august/spacegoatLiterallyASpacegoat.jpg) <br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/mvbar900.jpg<br />
<br />
Introducing the next World of Warcraft companion up soon for adoption in the Battle.net Shop: Argi! This impossibly cute little creature will jump into your heart and nibble at your Blue Woolen Socks. She’s ready to help guide you through the savage lands of Draenor, climbing, swimming, and running wherever you go. Argi will be ready for a home this December, right in time for Winter Veil—just don’t get too upset if she chomps through the wrapping paper.<br />
<br />
For every Argi pet purchased between December 3 and December 31, 100% of the adoption fee ($10 in the U.S.; pricing varies by region) will be donated in support of the American Red Cross (http://www.redcross.org/) to assist in Ebola relief efforts (http://www.redcross.org/ebolaoutbreak), helping enable the Red Cross to provide assistance to those in need.<br />

I'm curious how anyone knows, when any game company releases a brand new game in a brand new IP, how successful it will be or if it will be a decent game. Or is this strictly a Blizzard thing? Inquiring minds. My guess is that it will be quite successful. The rest depends on how you define 'decent game'.</div></div><hr />

Tournaments were available on official free streams anyway, didnt know this before blizzcon. For everything else there was enough free coverage on the internet, without stream i didnt have to watch the nerds scream all the time when metzen says something.<br />
And there werent that much real news... ok Hearthstone is Blizzards license to print money so we get new cards and Xpacs every 6 Months because this way people spend even more money on it. Overwatch is there to get a foot into FPS-Genre, i personally am quite disappointed as i dont either like Pixar graphics nor FPS. SC2 gets a new Xpac but not really a lot of love. Nothing about WoW (because WoD will be out next week).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If people had honestly expected to see movie teasers, wow expansions or even a lot of WoW news with WoD coming in 4 days they were out of their minds. <br />
<br />
We got three new game announcements, more tourneys than ever, an amazing group performing their legendary music and all the usual stuff. How was this any less than what we usually get? <br />
<br />
Poeple seem to forget that it is BLIZZcon, not WOWcon. <br />
<br />
My two cents. I enjoyed it. Looking forward to thursday! :D</div></div><hr />

As for Outcast, what a way to reward your players who have stuck with you for 20 years, and 10 years on wow, to announce a new ip on the anniversary of your money maker, one that will just go on the slush pile of shooters. Warcraft 4 is what your fans/paying customers want, it would out sell diablo, but no, you have to pander to Metzen. I hope Outcast will be a success for you as a blizzard fan, but I see it being a fad where people will try it and move on.<br />
Blizzard don't just drop the ball, they lost it. As for the film debacle, blizzard should have not screened anything, that was within their power. Blizzcon was a huge opportunity wasted. No matter what, I won't be buying another VT again.</div></div><hr />

care to explain how would you watch &quot;free&quot; stream if the guy streaming would not pay for it? its promotion of theirs product what did you expect to be it? and its blizzcon and as such it cannot be focused on only one blizzard game. and what did you expect about wow? xpac is due in few days</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, the most people i know buying it (including me) is mainly for the Virtual Goodies... there was never any other real insensitive any year since all announcements/trailers where released withing short time on any news page including mmo-champ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the stream to me is free, nothing has came from my own pocket. Willing to bet the guy didn't even pay with his cash prob some stolen account info or card to pay. <br />
<br />
Just yeah its junk i can't see how they can charge you for it. Just slap a few adverts on screen every 20mins or something and make it free. Made me laugh they even tried to sell rubbish during a paid stream and pulled in adverts from other companies. Pure greed that is.<br />
<br />
Guess some people wanted just the pet so thats fair enough i guess but for those who don't want some rubbish pet it is a slap in the face if a loyal customer. <br />
<br />
Been playing a long time with never a drop in my sub and still they wish to charge people like me to watch them advertise there next game to me.</div></div><hr />

Yeah very true even though the movie is a Blizz IP, it seems that it is the movie company calling the shots on who gets to see it first..<br />
<br />
And well it is a Blizzcon not a Warcraftcon, Starcraftcon, Diablocon or even a Overwatchcon it is a time for everyone to get to see everything that Blizz are doing at the time and well when you look at it they are as far as I know the only game development company that bothers to hold its own event..</div></div><hr />

And well it is a Blizzcon not a Warcraftcon, Starcraftcon, Diablocon or even a Overwatchcon it is a time for everyone to get to see everything that Blizz are doing at the time and well when you look at it they are as far as I know the only game development company that bothers to hold its own event..<br />
<br />
I wholeheartedly agree that it's Blizzcon not for any specific game, and I was more than satisfied with the VT given it's the first time I've actually bought one.<br />
<br />
I just had to point out that CCP runs its own event for EVE Online every year in Iceland.</div></div><hr />

Awesome movie presentation (yeah we didn't get to see any footage but so what, its not the end of the world), great news about Overwatch looks like a great game, great news about Hearthstone I'm really happy with the speed and efficiency they're achieving with it, 2 Cool panels about WoW (cinamatics &amp; Q&amp;A), great Documentary, contests weren't anything special and an awesome closing with Metallica. Oh and the Hearthstone Tournament was awesome. Also the ingame stuff you get from the Virtual Ticket make it even better :) I'd say 9/10.</div></div><hr />

&quot;we&quot; ? I assure you, I'm quite tired of only having Diablo, Starcraft and Warcraft games from Blizzard. I do not believe you speak for the public at large, so you'd be well advised to speak solely for yourself.<br />

The rumours of Warcraft revamps are exciting, but it seems it's not far enough along for them to even mention yet. I was disappointed in this too.<br />
<br />
Overwatch looks insanely fun though so I'm pretty excited about that. A new IP is a pretty big deal for Blizzard, whether it appeals to you or not.<br />

It was good, a typical Metallica set with nothing too special which fits perfectly for blizzcon. Kirk messed up on a few of his solos and improvised parts of some others, just had a rusty sort of feel to them. James' (new?) custom ESP guitars are awesome.<br />

Not to mention it was the WRONG SLIDES half the time, like during the Warcraft panel. That might have been the panel's fault for going out of order, but it was still a horrible mess.

Yeah, I find myself agreeing with this. Unless something major happened that was outside of the contestants control, part of cosplay is making a costume that stays together. If it's too fragile to be worn then it's purely art and not cosplay.<br />

It just means it didnt cater to you and since you didnt pay it, thats just fine then. The expansion is less than a handful of days away, its literally this week. What news were you expecting? They're not going to seriously reveal future stuff thats very liable to drasticly change RIGHT on the toes of a new expansion. Thats content for future blizzcons.<br />
<br />
But most people go to blizzcon for blizzard stuff. We got the new starcraft expansion, movie review for those at the con, discussion panels for all the games, the documentary, a 10 year anniversary party at a nearby venue, a BRAND NEW IP (which blizzard has not done in what, 9 or 17 WHOLE YEARS?!)<br />

Willing to bet the guy didn't even pay with his cash prob some stolen account info or card to pay. <br />
<br />
Just yeah its junk i can't see how they can charge you for it. Just slap a few adverts on screen every 20mins or something and make it free. Made me laugh they even tried to sell rubbish during a paid stream and pulled in adverts from other companies. Pure greed that is.<br />
<br />
Guess some people wanted just the pet so thats fair enough i guess but for those who don't want some rubbish pet it is a slap in the face if a loyal customer. <br />
<br />
Been playing a long time with never a drop in my sub and still they wish to charge people like me to watch them advertise there next game to me.<br />
<br />
I find it rather funny, that you speak about being a loyal customer, yet you watch copyrighted content from the company you are so loyal to, for free and absolutely against the copyright rules.<br />
<br />
Regarding buying for a Virtual Ticket, BlizzCon have always been about their upcoming releases, new works in progress and other general announcements. Only exception this year, an exception many already knew (if not by common sense, then by watching the schedule), is that this years BlizzCon was not centered on WoW. Blizzard is the company behind WoW, and many other games (did you not know already), and BlizzCon is a convent for the fans and followers of the company - in all aspects, not just WoW.<br />
<br />
If you feel let down by this BlizzCon it's no one but your own fault. BlizzCon was absolutely everything I expected it to be, not just this year, but every year. You are able to see the schedule prior to buying your ticket, and you could by then decide whether or not the content was of your liking.<br />
<br />
After all, it's a company. They do this to earn money, and that's the main object of this, and any other company in the world. If you want their product, pay. If not.... You know where the door is. They try to accomplish joy to their customers, but they cannot do so on behalf of their income. Yes, they make money on their product, but who doesn't? Windows charge customers, apple charge customers, adobe charge customers, everyone charge customers. And they charge you for the quality of what you get.<br />

It's the 10th anniversary, can you blame people for expecting more for that than a 1h documentary and a dumb Q&amp;A session ?<br />
<br />
Go to your in-game. Check your calender. Celebrate for a whole month anniversary in-game. What more do you expect? BlizzCon is not WoW based, it's a company carrying many games. WoW is indeed their bestseller, but they had nothing to talk about regarding the new expansion. Everything is released. Had they spend hours recapping WoD, you would be annoyed as well - I bet.</div></div><hr />

Not much has come out of Blizzcon this year, particularly in regards to WoW. Also I'd like to add that even though the winning costume was very good it's not really fair to award them first place if by the time the show was on it was broken and it couldn't be displayed. Just my opinion. I mean imagine any other show, ( Miss World, a dog pageant whatever ) would they give you first prize if you didn't actually turn up?<br />
<br />
It was not broken. One of the legs broke earlier but they fixed it. She hurt her ankle getting up the 2nd ramp to the stage. And as Chaud said, the judging completely takes place way before the stage presentation. The stage presentation is just to show off to the fans.</div></div><hr />

Unless something major happened that was outside of the contestants control, part of cosplay is making a costume that stays together. If it's too fragile to be worn then it's purely art and not cosplay.<br />
<br />
Still wondering where the SC2 recap is...<br />
<br />
She fell and hurt herself as well as breaking the costume on her way onto the stage. This was explained during the con but not made very clear for people who are confused. <br />
<br />
Also, these costumes are technically judged prior to us seeing them on stage. They pre-screen the whole thing. What you're seeing as the &quot;contest&quot; is nothing more than an exhibition. Which is why you saw Blizz toss Tracer, Widowmaker, &amp; Reaper in there. Contest was over with.</div></div><hr />

She fell backstage and seriously injured her foot and had to be carried away. That's why she wasn't on the stage. It wasn't her costume that broke.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't broken. She did a small photo shoot the next day in the costume. She posted the whole story on her facebook page. She broke a leg earlier before judging (her foot got caught on the carpet and she tripped), she fixed it. For the stage presentation when trying to go up the ramps to the stage the weight of the costume pulled her off her stilts and hurt her ankle. The costume was fine, she just could not walk in it.</div></div><hr />

Probably not Blizzard's decision at all, and probably has a TON to do with copyright and licensing.<br />

This is coming from myself, who is a professional and deals with copyright within the music industry on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
Example... Songwriter writes a song, records it, and record label publishes it. The rights for someone else to perform that song do NOT belong to the songwriter, they belong to the publishing company.<br />
<br />
I would love to know for 100% certainty, but through my experience, I would bet on the fact that Blizz would have LOVED to stream the trailer, and they were not allowed to by suits in a different location.</div></div><hr />

Sadly most of what you listed was available for free. I really began to wonder what I paid for when I found out that they were making most of it available for free, and the one thing I really wanted to see wasn't shown via virtual ticket (the movie).</div></div><hr />

Even though I was at the show I was so happy they had the VT included as I watched some of the finals as I was moving around the convention, and was able to catch panels that I could not attend. On a side note I loved Overwatch and cannot wait until beta starts; which I do really hope that I am accepted. Many people are saying its just tf2 reshipped, well I hate tf2 and Overwatch in no way feels like it. The fact you are focusing on class based abilities to provide more mobility on the map instead of just shooting someone had me hooked. I mainly was mercy as support, and I loved how mobile they made her as a support character, especially since support gets screwed sometimes on being able to get out of firefights with their lower healthpool ect.

Except the judgements had already been made a while back with her in her full suit and the audience/stage part was just presenting the winners. Which she WAS frikkin present for despite being in tears and having a badly injured ankle. <br />
<br />
Shit logic like yours is &quot;hey this guy wasnt present for taking the emmy due to an actual physical injury just before coming on the stage, lets just hand it to anyone&quot;.<br />
<br />
your sort of callous heartless attitude disgusts me.</div></div><hr />

The costumes had been judged and the winners already selected by the time this happened.<br />
Telling her to get lost because she was injured while trying to get on the stage would be ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

All of these things! It was a fantastic blizzcon. I've attended them all and this was easily my favorite, despite being light on world of warcraft content. It's BLIZZcon, not WOWcon though and if you are a fan of the company and not just one game, there was a lot to do and see. Overwatch, Goblins vs Gnomes, Legacy of the Void, Heroes matches and heroes, D3 goblins, awesome tournaments, movie panel, movie trailer!! and Metallica - which was so very much better than blink 182 its not even funny. <br />
<br />
Almost too much for just 2 days. Without the virtual ticket I would have missed a lot of it. It's a great deal unless you literally just care about new world of warcraft stuff i guess and in that case, at least you still got some pets and other digital goodies. There's a new expansion in 3 days, anniversary content a week after that. It wasn't wow's time to shine and the con was all the better for it, I think.</div></div><hr />

Did they warn the virtual ticket holders that it would not be shown to them? Because if not and they know they are still in the wrong for not disclaiming that. <br />
<br />
I still personally think it wasn't solely Legendary. The preview would have leaked anyway. I think it was an agreed upon decision by both parties.<br />

<br />
<br />
Maybe some news on a general direction they plan on taking this expansion other than stating the final raid will be Grom and will involve the Legion somehow?<br />
<br />
All we've gotten so far from them is that, and the fact that they don't know what they're going to do for patches. We might get 3 tiers, we might get 2. They're aiming for yearly expansions. Grom is the end boss. Farahlon might make it but probably won't and they don't seem to know how they would implement it anyway. They don't really seem to know anything about this expansion beyond the launch, so it would have been nice to get a little encouragement from them that they actually have somekind of plan that doesn't end with another year long content gap after the final raid, or at this point a year long content gap after launch before the raid. They just don't seem to know enough to even say anything about it at Blizzcon other than repeat changes that have already been implemented for 3 weeks and reiterate things they've said in blue posts and Q&amp;A for the past year.<br />
<br />
It's discomforting whether Warlords hits in a few days or not. Maybe it will be more fun than I anticipate and we will all be so super duper entertained with our Garrisons and Ashran that we won't notice 6 months of no new content other than the implementation of High Maul and raid finder. Who knows, but it doesn't seem promising at this point.<br />
<br />
That's my distaste with them not talking about it at Blizzcon, and yes I would have also liked some confirmation or a teaser about this Azshara trademark as well. It wouldn't have killed my desire to play Warlords to have found out about a distant expansion, even if just the confirmation of the title and general plot or some sample concept art. I can't help it if somebody else is simple-minded enough to completely lose sight of the launch of Warlords because they know somewhere at somepoint down the line there will be another expansion and we actually know what it is.<br />

Yeah, the costumes were amazing this year. And I get that she had difficulty with her costume and all, but perhaps she should have taken some of that into account when she made it? Or had plenty of back-up/help with her to help her on stage. <br />
<br />
A dude showed up as a tank with somebody helping him and I'm pretty sure he was in a wheel chair. The abomination dude had difficulty and had somebody helping him. <br />
<br />
I just feel like there were so many great ones up there that they just chose this one girl to win because she was having a bad day, but the pictures on mmo may not be the best to go by. (The costume looks kind of simple in terms of exterior construction as opposed to some of the others that had shiny metallic/plastic/led lights and all other things adding that extra bit of detail.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
They had a party, limited edition foil label bottles of beer, a documentary, and have a new expansion with unique anniversary content coming in less than a week along with new content in their warcraft themed card game, and two new wow heroes for their brawler, a great panel about the cinematic and the lords of war shorts. . Warcraft had its 10 year anniversary moment there. <br />
<br />
They chose to make room for a brand new game that people have been clamoring for info about for years and the other very successful games they have. They CANNOT be just the world of warcraft company. <br />
<br />
As an attendee who has played wow for 10 years, played warcraft for 20 years i felt it was represented well all things considered. It's a 2 day show and they had a completely brand new franchise to talk about. Something had to give and there's no reason to spend 2 days going on and on about content past the stuff we havent even really seen yet.<br />
<br />

The judging was earlier in the day, as stated many times by people on this thread and across the internet to quell this phantom controversy. Walking across the stage for everyone is simply pagentry. She won fairly. The end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TLDR - Some people who only care about world of warcraft felt disappointed at the lack of focus on the game in light of the anniversary. However, as Blizzcon is BLIZZcon and not WOWcon, it was an excellent showing for the company as a whole with some very cool stuff coming out of the con, such as a brand new game and setting, new expansions, updated maps and heroes, movie news, as well as a great closing concert and since it either cost you nothing to watch the streams and read the news here, or very little to subscribe to the event and see all the tournaments, panels, and get some digital goodies, saying it was a &quot;waste&quot; of money is a silly judgement call to make.</div></div><hr />
