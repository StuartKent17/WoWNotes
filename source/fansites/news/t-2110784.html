Missed the stream. A bit confused by this. Am I reading this right that already dropped legendaries will remain ilvl 895 come tuesday?<br />

They are getting bumped to 910. When they add more legendarys they will already be at max level so you wont have to upgrade them through nighthold drops.</div></div><hr />

Ion really isn't the person you would ask this question to. The best answer he is going to give is, &quot;it is something we'd lie to see in the future.&quot; Or He won't answer a lore question. Wrong person to ask about all this as those portions of the game he probably has the least interaction with and probably only gets a general update on them when work is currently being done. More than likely a solidly generic answer would have been what he gave.</div></div><hr />

Well, I know I would definitely level mine up from 100 if they reverted the changes they made going into Legion. It was one of the most rewarding specs in the game. It felt so smooth and you felt like you were in control of what happened to your character. Sure guard could use some slight nerfs and the healing could be a bit less to be in line with their vision of tank healing in Legion. But it feels like your just there taking damage and thats it. Demonhunters got their healing and prot warriors got guard (ignore pain). <br />
Played it in prepatch and haven't touched it since so things might have changed but this is the impression I get from friends which have a brewmaster tank alt, it's probably strong but it feels terrible compared to how it used to be.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they should reconsider making DK damage more viable without wrists in first place?<br />
Also, make the core rotation stronger then, cause I doubt they even know current dk situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Secondly: The Ashbringer hidden artifact questline was NOT FUN IN ANY WAY WHAT SO EVER. I prefer grinding a single boss every day with a % chance of a 'hidden' drop over that cancerous questline. <br />
By far the worst experience I've ever had in a video game with the amount of sleep deprivation I had to suffer to wait for that fucking cunt of a slime to spawn.<br />

I even skipped college on the day I finally got it. If I hadn't I'd have lost my best chance at getting that fucking thing by 30 minutes. Having to have three to four screens open just so I could camp several servers for it was horrific.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what they are having a hard time figuring out. If a spec is good and no one wants to play it that means its either not as good as they think it is, or the spec is not much fun to play and no one wants to play it. From everything I've read, it's just not a ton of fun to play and with an expansion that can take so much effort on one character, if that spec isn't fun then no one is going to waste time on it.</div></div><hr />

what the fuck are you talking about?<br />
the arms one just had never spawned, do you have proof it was broken?<br />
and what about the frost one? its allways been in the game, just the world boss it hasent spawned yet, since i read the lore of the hidden skin, and read the lore of the saoultakers, it was pretty fucking odvious it would drop from them</div></div><hr />

Are they high on amphetamine? Several days of farming the AV (before the fix), then several days of camping the mob, then several days/weeks of fishing is considered fun? With the current system, you had much more chance and fun and less time of getting the hidden protection or holy artifact skin, then grinding the 100 WQ/dungeons/1000 player kills with that artifact and then getting the same color of Ashbringer unlocked (because the color slots are linked between all specs). Unless you really want that green Corrupted Ashbringer.</div></div><hr />

If a spec is good and no one wants to play it that means its either not as good as they think it is, or the spec is not much fun to play and no one wants to play it. From everything I've read, it's just not a ton of fun to play and with an expansion that can take so much effort on one character, if that spec isn't fun then no one is going to waste time on it.<br />
<br />
I guess it's as I've said when joking around with friends: class fantasy&gt;gameplay. Just make expel harm a glass of beer you drink to heal, guard a big keg you smash over your head to have around you as a shield and keep the spec as it was mechanically, and BAM you have all the class fantasy you could want and a fun functioning spec that lots of people will play again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Balance is anything, but far from underpowered. Maybe not as strong as Fire Mages - but a big part of their AE gets nerfed with the legendary wrists nerf. Balance has strong utility for raids and mythic+ (BR, treants, Innervate, ability to off tank/taunt) on top of competitive AE and ST damage as proven by WarcraftLogs rankings.</div></div><hr />

Coming from somone playing Paladin and Mage, I prefer camping a spawn to having to rely on a daily roll for the sheep staff. The sheep staff is NOT fun.

IDK about all that. 9 months at the longest would be my guess.<br />
<br />
considering they want to push out 7.2 while we're in nighthold still, I doubt 7.3 will be the last patch.<br />
<br />
If they follow schedule the next xpac is due for fall of 2018 at this rate.<br />
<br />
And if they keep the pace they've been keeping so far, I'd say even 7.5 is a possibility tbh.<br />
<br />
Even if Argus ends the burning legion for now, there is still the old god themes creeping up everywhere in legion. There is room for more, and the way Ian was smirking at blizzcon, I think there is more.</div></div><hr />

I think it's pretty safe to say that Argus will be the last raid; not necessarily the last patch, of course, but the last raid instance. If we allow for, let's say, 8 months of that (to avoid a repeat of the 12+ month debacle that was DS, SoO, and HFC) that would put Argus release around JAN/FEB 2018. This in turn would leave about 12 months from Nighthold release to allow for Tomb of Sargeras - that is quite a stretch. I doubt that 6 months NH 6 months Tomb is what people would really appreciate. It's possible they'll bridge it with yet another mini-raid or two, which would be something like 4 months NH 2 months mini1 + 4 months Tomb 2 months mini2. Now that sounds a lot more realistic.

With the speed that they have on releasing content, if the new expansion is gonna hit in 2018, then they will proberly have an extrx raid tier ready or atleast something like ToV. I think that we will see a max of 6-7 months of wait between each content drop, whether it is expansion or big patch.<br />

Before, we always had people talk with spin, not admitting fault or problems within the game. Now we have a guy, who openly talks about the many mistakes they have made and how they are working on fixing it. Ofcourse, he can not talk about everything, but it is a good sign, that WoW is in great hands :D</div></div><hr />

The Corrupted Ashbringer quest chain was absolutely awesome. Until I got to the slime and had to sit and do nothing for 3 days before I could get a tag. Then over a week (2537 casts, fishing skill from 73 to 766) of RNG fishing nightmares before the damn thing dropped. It had by far the highest potential and best material to be great. It wound up being 40 minutes of breadcrumbs (I got really lucky with both books. I would gladly have traded that for lucky fishing...) followed by 2 weeks of sitting on my ass in a vanilla zone killing a plague bear (poor bastard, he got the brunt of everyone's hate) and collecting thousands of useless fish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That question has nothing to do with your comment... The AP issue is a completely different story to the actual balance of the class. Blizzard has already stated that Brewmaster is strong, but because no one is giving it a try due to the skill cap, it's not being played. How do you fix this problem? You can't buff Brewmaster otherwise they will end up broken and faceroll, and they would have to nerf it again.<br />
<br />
Also, if you're level 30 on your Fire artifact right now, you should have no difficulties getting your Frost weapon up due to Artifact Knowledge. Maybe not to level 30, but to level 20 at least. That's completely fine.</div></div><hr />

Except that's pure bullshit.<br />
<br />
Every single top end guild have BrM players. If the specs was as good as blizzard state it is you would see BrM everywhere. You don't because they aren't at the level where warrior/druid and even paladin (for different reason) are.<br />
<br />
BrM is a capable tank, no doubt. But far from the &quot;itz a secret OP spec that just nobody plays&quot; bullshit they keep trying to feed us.<br />
<br />
And I have no hate. Legion as a whole is amazing. But on the balance side blizzard looks completely out of touch, more than ever before. PVE balance is bad, PVP balance is plain garbage. Can't understand how they can't see this and some decision that make no sense like buffing mage's specs when other are waaaaay more in need. (No shit ele sucks, why buff mages first ?

They said at the blizzcon panel that Balance was one of the classes that has a good rotation but the numbers need to be tweaked as they felt to low.<br />
<br />
The problem with Balance utility is that other classes bring the same thing or something better.<br />
<br />
They only have strong AE and ST if they have the right legendary. That being said, EN is very Balance friendly. Seeing HoV made boomkin show its downsides. Boomkin has very poor mobility and they don't have the rest of a toolkit to make up for it.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't be opposed to themed BG's of the same style. Temple, for instance, is very balanced -- having different themes for it would at least make it feel less boring.<br />
<br />
Although I'm very much a fan of the perfectly balanced BG's like Temple and less of a fan of the more awkward ones like IoC or AV. I like IoC and AV but I don't like what I perceive to be imbalance. I like to KNOW I've won due to fairness so they have no excuse or I have no excuse for my loss.<br />

I mean even significant theming for holidays would be neat.<br />

In fact I'd even be OK with a &quot;BG of the cycle&quot; where a cycle is a week or three and random prefers that over others, if all is random. This way people can get good at a specific map.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I'm rambling at this point I feel</div></div><hr />

Tanks and healers instantly lose their bonus items, the group loses some of it's dmg/healing buffs. We encourage you to group with your guildies but we're going to take away some of your rewards if you do. If i'm tanking or healing and doing it for a bonus bag and someone joins thanks to the new quick join feature i'll just get grumpy. Likewise i'll feel bad telling someone &quot;sorry, no, i'll lose my bonus&quot;</div></div><hr />

The sheep staff is NOT fun. It has some fun aspects to it, but then it's totally ruined by ridiculous drawn out gated RNG. The RNG for Ashbringer you can at least grind out at your own pace - ridiculous as it is.<br />
<br />
Yeah, both the Arcane and the Frost Artifact skins for mages are gated by a secret roll that happens once a day when you enter the class hall for the 1st time that day. There's no way to speed it up by player efforts, and that's kind of shitty to say the least. I actually snorted when I read them call the Ret and Arcane artifact chains &quot;fun&quot;...Maybe fun for them to make up, but not fun for the players dealing with the RNG devil.</div></div><hr />

Getting harder and harder to trust Blizzard, especially when they lied to us about the Arms warrior hidden appearance and Frost one as well.<br />
<br />
Karazhan is best 5 man they put in since like burning crusade. This gave me precisely the same feeling as 10 man karazhan in burning crusade when you weren't overgeared.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If everyone of those groups were really full ones, that would be 1,500,000 characters. Of course many players have alts which will run kara too. And group on group finder list does not mean it will be filled. Anyway we could say one million players were doing kara globally. How many players wow has atm? 5-10 million? So it's 10-20% of players? Again, i really would like to know how many actually runs these mythic only dungeons. Because future dungeons (tomb of sargeras patch 5-man) will have heroic mode too, from the start (though not sure of that, as they just said in the blizzcon that it will have heroic mode too, so it could as well come later)</div></div><hr />

YESSSS keep going nerf Fire mages because they make awesome dmg but wait simcrafst says warriors priests warlocks and rogues top4 ? Hmm so where we can find Fire mages. Let waste mlns ap on Fire spec and let them just them all reroll to frost like in WoD or Arcane like all Contents... <br />
Last 2 months prepaid and retaired to next expansion because mage was unplayable on all specs just arcane (arcane blast, arcane blast, arcane blast, arcane blast, arcane missiles ,arcane barrage and keep going) 1 mln's dps . Cry me a river.</div></div><hr />

That's ridiculous. The whole reason we play the game and are hooked (or enjoying the game over a long period of time) is RNG.</div></div><hr />

Is there any thread anywhere discussing this, or is it all on Discord nowadays?</div></div><hr />

It also is a case on participating on the previous week and not overall participation on something that is still optional content not intended to be the endgame for everyone. Expect the same people who made up BS numbers the past month to take the comment out of context as overall number of players who participated in mythic content as a whole. Lets also not forget the complaints of those who said it was not worth it to run in the first place who would of otherwise.</div></div><hr />

We're already second to last in the collected parses, but our legendary is a PROBLEM?!?! I guess people are still crying about DKs from the Wrath launch Death Knights. We're the LEAST mobile, we trail far behind when running with just about any group, and our dps is so undertuned that it is painful, yet WE'RE the problem... You can't make this stuff up folks. Good to see mages and fury warriors near the top again, that hasn't happened since... Um, hmm... last expansion, and the one before that, and before that... and before that</div></div><hr />

It's just stupid to nerf the BIS that's actually makes viable the spec, there are many people trying to get that item (which is super low droprate) because they enjoy playing DK and now gets a nerf, thats no sense at all tbh..<br />
<br />
And, keep in mind that nobody actually wants a DK in party, we are at the bottom of pve/dps/spec, and the &quot;NEED RDPS&quot; in queue is high nowadays.<br />
<br />
Dear Blizzard, don't screw it up, u gonna ruin this char.</div></div><hr />
