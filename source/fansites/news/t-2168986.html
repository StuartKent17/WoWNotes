PvP Feedback<br />
To give some more context on the comment I made earlier about Rogue/Mage: we think it's fine if RMx comps work well. We don't think it's fine if RMx comps are the only ones that work well. To put it another way: we wouldn't want to nerf Rogue/Mage to the point that no one wants to play it any more, but we wouldn't want to let it be grossly overpowered, either.<br />
<br />
I don't have any specific changes to share at this time but wanted to let you all know that we're actively discussing it, and that the feedback we've gotten through this thread (and other areas as well) has been very helpful in isolating exactly what your concerns are. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/798325-pvp-discussion-with-the-devs/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17614933267?page=7#124))<br />
<br />
Class Balance and Player Perception<br />
It really sucks that Blizzard left feral terrible for aoe, and weak overall, and hence bad for mythics for so long. It both makes for regular unpleasant interactions based entirely on preconceived notions rather than performance. It also makes it really hard to get into groups for challenging content as a feral. <br />
I mean sure, but I find it's best to distance yourself from those folks if you have issue with it.<br />
<br />
You're a part of this community, too. You have you say in these things as much as they do. Show them what you're worth and make them talk. <br />
<br />
If it's a recurring problem, find a casual group of friends or guild to play with. That will help your experience a ton.<br />
<br />
I expect this kind of response form a small minority of ignorant players but not from a blue.<br />
<br />
The point is that its not about what you can do ... its about spec's being poor enough for long enough that a reputation precludes opportunities for performance ... and just playing with good friends isn't a solution and you should know it. SO 90% of the community can just queue up for content with strangers, but because your spec sucks you can only play with close friends? <br />
<br />
For a lark I just checked the 90th % for my ilvl for normal nighthold - feral is dead last. <br />
https://www.warcraftlogs.com/statistics/11#dataset=90&amp;difficulty=3&amp;sample=7&amp;bracket=17<br />
<br />
I can do what I can as an individual to competently play, and flask, and food buff, and pot, but its a small ripple in the ocean when Bliz doesn't bother to properly balance things.<br />
I understand what you're trying to say... but then the top and bottom of the log you are showing me are ~10 points apart. That seems rather normal, and not much of a swing to really try to claim that those players deserve to be sidelined or kicked (especially when talking about the 90th percentile).<br />
<br />
I get that balance will always be a concern (and we're still working on it!), and, yes, there will always be a class in &quot;last&quot;, but a lot of the response to these things are community constructions around players treating other players as if nothing but DPS meters and &quot;flavor of the month&quot; specs matter. It's our job as members of the community to correct that kind of attitude when we see it, as it seems we generally agree it's not constructive.<br />
<br />
If OP finds a group of people who don't focus on the minutia (ie., non-hardcore/elite/etc players), he'll have an easier time avoiding &quot;insults&quot; over his spec choice, and that's what he seems to want.<br />
<br />
Is your argument to underpreforming specs seriously &quot;join a casual guild&quot; since no top guild would want one? lol<br />
Nope! My argument is that the community has poorly built, ingrained expectations based on perceptions of class balance that should be reformed.<br />
<br />
Joining a casual guild is an easy one-off solution, I guess. The bigger solution is us continuing work on class balance while engaging in conversations like these.<br />
<br />
Edit: For clarification, it's fine for high expectations to exist for harder content, just as it is for expectations to exist that content should be able to be cleared with any spec/class in tow. I just disagree that the scrutiny placed on folks who aim to be more casual or just going about their day is well-placed.<br />
<br />
Joining a casual guild is an easy one-off solution, I guess. The bigger solution is us continuing work on class balance while engaging in conversations like these.<br />
I'm not trying to hardball or anything, but the truth is there's zero reason to bring a feral druid or an unholy dk right now.<br />
<br />
Sure people can have fun and play the spec they want, but the reality is when unholy is literally behind frost by 150k, no one in their right mind would recruit an unholy dk when frost is just preforming so much better.<br />
<br />
As for Feral, the game has 4 classes, 7 specs that all wear leather. Feral Druid brings nothing extra to the table. Windwalker brings raid wide move speed aura. Rogues and Demon Hunters bring huge damage, Boomkins bring versatility of being a strong cleave ranged with decent single target. Feral has no single target and low AoE and no utility worth mentioning.[/i]Like I said, and it was a bit vague there, but I agree insofar that balance isn't necessarily where it needs to be - and again, because these things run off numbers, there /will/ always be a &quot;bottom&quot; of the barrel. In that note, if you are running an operation based off that alone, then sure - but the vast, vast majority of our playerbase would never be in a situation where that is warranted, and is instead a community machination.<br />
<br />
I personally always thought the better solution was diversification, with classes bringing more than just DPS to the table, and their DPS adjusted because of that. But I'm not a class designer. <br />
<br />
Like . . . you guys can't change human nature. Some of your responses Ornyx are asking for the entire community to up and change their behavior in a pretty significant way. <br />
<br />
It's one thing to work towards less toxic behavior in terms of aggression/name calling and such, but expecting people to fundamentally change ingrained human behavior is kind of a bit much don't you think?<br />
<br />
Also, just to point out, 10% difference between top and bottom isn't bad per se, but when you're measuring dps by the hundreds of thousands that 10% is pretty alarming when you see it in game.<br />
<br />
And not to put too fine a point on it, but you (blizzard) are the ones who design the content. If you eliminated any and all dps checks, then you would see the playerbase soften their attitudes. You guys are the ones putting stuff like Krosus, Tichondrius, enrage timers, immediate threat adds, etc in the game. As long as these exist, people will default to &quot;only top performing specs are good&quot; mentality.I don't really think that's true. The behavior here is very much learned, and didn't exist before folks were staring at damage meters and 'gear score' to try to gain leverage over others. It's a bit much to ask that we divulge from that entire path, as its very much a part of WoW these days, but I don't think its much to understand that low DPS may not be the players fault, and that they don't necessarily deserve the blame or treatment they may get.<br />
<br />
But yes, we (Blizzard) as designers also have an obligation and a hand in on the bargain here. Again, feedback is being sent along relative to this. Most of the watched discussion on balance topics now it happening on the Class Development forum so I suggest chiming in there if you get a chance.

<br />
For one, the undead female was a very poor example since I imagine those animations are probably not hooked up properly yet.<br />
<br />
Human male has them all how I imagine they're supposed to look since animations have largely been normalized except for one per spec usually (e.g. frost strike, bloodthirst, etc...)<br />
<br />
It was also missing things:<br />
<br />
Death Coil AND Howling Blast now use the same cast animation, but DC didn't get new particles.<br />
Casting Remorseless Winter, Blood Boil, and two other spells also has a new animation.<br />
Apocalypse for Unholy now uses the &quot;execute&quot; animation that Arms uses - the same one Soul Reaper currently uses.<br />
Casting death and decay also uses a new animation, but the video doesn't show it very well.<br />
<br />
I also think I recall a tweet or something saying that DnD is too hard to see and they're going to make it pop a little more.<br />
<br />
Remorseless Winter has slightly more obnoxious particles now as well.<br />
<br />
Those are all I can think of, but I tested pretty much everything on a couple of races, and the only one with all of those changes was human male so if you can, I'd find a video with that - it definitely shows some more impressive cast animations.<br />
<br />
Lastly, oddly absent from this patch is a change to casting Scourge Strike while in Death and Decay to do the &quot;sweeping&quot; animation that Heart Strike uses (frost strike and cleave also use this) when you're cleaving with it, still just uses the regular ol' vertical swing.<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of - there's a thread about this on our forum (DK class forum here, that is) and I listed every change I found somewhere in it.</div></div><hr />

You do realise that in the analogy you've provided , the mother is right by feeding you hummus or a banana, instead of nuggets or something ?<br />
<br />
And back to the feral thing , if anyone was being a wall - it was the guy the blue was talking to . There's plenty of ferals out there doing content, raids and dungeons. They may not be topping the meters , but they sure as hell qualify to enter groups. The guy just kept screaming &quot; no no , they won't take me anywhere , it's your fault blizzard &quot; - may be he's just a shitty players .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. because it shows that its just too much this Expansion for the People who wanna go for Worldfirst with the AP Grind on top of 15h+ Raiding.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind them updating effects but particularly for ones as great and iconic as those they should just be recreating the existing ones in higher fidelity, much like they did with the T20 sets resembling T6. Death grip and DnD are definitely not effects that could ever benefit from being reinvented.</div></div><hr />

And back to the feral thing , if anyone was being a wall - it was the guy the blue was talking to . There's plenty of ferals out there doing content, raids and dungeons. They may not be topping the meters , but they sure as hell qualify to enter groups. The guy just kept screaming &quot; no no , they won't take me anywhere , it's your fault blizzard &quot; - may be he's just a shitty players .<br />
<br />
Unfortunately that's not the reality. My friend has the same problem as that guy. He queues for the mythic groups in group finder and almost all of the groups reject him for being feral.<br />
<br />
He links all the achievements they ask for and yet, receives a &quot;sorry, but no&quot; most of the time just for being a feral druid.</div></div><hr />

I really love seeing all the people. I've always thought cities in WoW (and MMOs in general) would look better with more people. Population should vary based on time of day; during the day there should be more people at the Auction House (work hours). At night, we'd see less. I really think Stormwind would be great with flocks of people around. It's not as if you can't just run through them, but if it actually seemed POPULATED I think it'd be awesome. I wonder why they don't do that. Think of the main city (I forget the name) in FFXV; it's not swarming with an absurd number of NPCs, but it absolutely feels more &quot;alive&quot; than Stormwind does.</div></div><hr />

that happens to any other class that is not good in m+ or raid, why bring a disc priest when you can bring a resto druid. The issue is more with the community and i don't think it fixable since every player has their own perception of every class and specc (what is the best to bring to the content they are doing like m+, raids, pvp, etc). Some issues i still i think are balancing issues like with disc priests healing being worse (or not on par with other healers) and that they should be doing dmg to heal is just dumb, holy palas do more dmg than a disc priest.<br />

Some new DK animations are worst than old ones.<br />
Howlingt Blast jump ? kek<br />
Otherwise, im not seen for example a Wraith Walk revamp, visually and fixed.<br />
<br />
If this are the all changes, someone at Blizz are just trolling the DK class.<br />
<br />
the jump part is probably not coded to be for their new animations (look at human dks in ptr, they hold up their swords towards the target when casting HB), dumb decision to take undead female to show new animation. But i agree i don't like any of the new animations at all, they should have just made the old ones HD.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking the same thing watching the video. Having all those citizens walking around would add to immersion. They did it with Garrisons, I don't know why they couldn't add it to the capital cities. What would be really cool, is at night seeing people stumble around drunk leaving one of the pubs!</div></div><hr />

&quot;I'm not trying to hardball or anything, but the truth is there's zero reason to bring a feral druid or an unholy dk right now.<br />
<br />
Sure people can have fun and play the spec they want, but the reality is when unholy is literally behind frost by 150k, no one in their right mind would recruit an unholy dk when frost is just preforming so much better.<br />
<br />
As for Feral, the game has 4 classes, 7 specs that all wear leather. Feral Druid brings nothing extra to the table. Windwalker brings raid wide move speed aura. Rogues and Demon Hunters bring huge damage, Boomkins bring versatility of being a strong cleave ranged with decent single target. Feral has no single target and low AoE and no utility worth mentioning.&quot; <br />
<br />
This part is in blue but no one from blizzard said this.<br />
<br />
The formatting is messed up on that part. There's an unmatched [/i] in the paragraph.<br />

I had to laugh - Ornyx is brave to take on this issue, but he only had the same useless bandaids to offer, like here - &quot;Avoid those people&quot;, &quot;join a guild&quot;, etc. They know the problem exists - and have no solution, because seemingly, the devs won't change their design to reflect it and fight it (That sounds like a typical Celestalon attitude - he's not gonna let anyone bully him around!). He can try to make it sound like only the high end groups have this issue, but it's trickled down into all of the content, and has since Wrath - it would be happening in LFR if these players had control over the group makeup. Everyone wants to be carried or to have flawless runs, every time. Granted, the grind aspect of the current game helps create that. <br />
<br />
So, there's an impasse here - the players refuse to change how they act, and the devs refuse to make corrections or changes to make up for the shortcomings of the players - which they acknowledge exist. <br />
<br />
The deal is, with a community like WOW's where everyone demands the best in everything from other players, so they have the least risk and the most efficient runs possible, you can't have the disparity in classes that exist right now. You just can't. <br />
<br />
Then he says I personally always thought the better solution was diversification, with classes bringing more than just DPS to the table, and their DPS adjusted because of that. But I'm not a class designer.<br />
<br />
And I agree with that, that's more in tune with vanilla/TBC raiding. But what we have now is the devs shaving off any utility they can find in classes for Legion, and making everything DPS, and designing the content to need DPS - and Ornyx is blaming it on damage meters? Whoa. Okay there, hoss. To be fair, my recollection of pugs is that everything has the DPS hammer applied to it - the bosses of previous LFRs or pugs that were clearly not DPS checks or dps races were played like they were, resulting in wipes. Thus, again - both sides are at fault here. <br />
<br />
What will break the impasse? I wouldn't bet on players changing. <br />
<br />
Me? I'd be a dick and put gear caps on content, so they can't be over-geared. And then sit back and drink up the delicious tears of rage.</div></div><hr />

Someone who makes these videos likes themselves some ud females. Other races wouldn't do the flip, don't worry. Still, feels like a placeholder that characters would use that basic animation at all. Here's to hoping.<br />
<br />
D&amp;d looks cool, but needs a clearer delineation.</div></div><hr />

Planet Coaster came out in November - I watched a couple guys play with the beta on Youtube, it looks like a great game, if you're into building games. Some of the stuff people have built already is pretty amazing. I'm avoiding it, because I know it will suck me in and never let go. :)</div></div><hr />
