Most of the Ruby Sanctum have been pushed in this patch and it looks like I have enough data in my hands for a small preview. As usual keep in mind that:<br />
This is only a preview based on game files, I could be wrong on a few things.<br />
Ruby Sanctum isn't even scheduled for release for Patch 3.3.3, it will be added with Patch 3.3.5 and a LOT of things can change in so much time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Official Description<br />
As we prepare for the public testing phase of minor content patch 3.3.3, some players might come across information regarding upcoming content that isn't yet available. To avoid any confusion, we'd like to tell you about an exciting new raid dungeon we are working on for content patch 3.3.5.<br />
<br />
The Ruby Sanctum<br />
<br />
A powerful war party of the Black Dragonflight, led by the fearsome Twilight dragon, Halion, have launched an assault upon the Ruby Sanctum beneath Wyrmrest Temple. By destroying the sanctum, the Black Dragonflight look to crush those that would stand in the way of their master&#8217;s reemergence into Azeroth and to ultimately shatter the Wyrmrest Accord &#8211; the sacred bond that unites the dragonflights.<br />
<br />
The battle that is to come will surely deal a crippling blow to the Red Dragonflight, however, it is up to you to stop this unprecedented offensive and defend the Ruby Sanctum. First you must face the assault of Halion's servants, Saviana Ragefire, Baltharus the Warborn, and General Zarithrian, before squaring off against Halion the Twilight Destroyer, a new and deadly force in this realm.<br />
<br />
The Ruby Sanctum will feature 10- and 25-player content, Heroic difficulties and all-new rewards! Stay tuned for more information as we get closer to its release. <br />
<br />
<br />
More Details on the instance / Loot Table by Zarhym<br />
<br />
Number 2. The lieutenants are sub-bosses which will each drop an Emblem of Frost (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49426/emblem-of-frost/). Halion is the main boss. While the activation of Heroic difficulty is different from the Obsidian Sanctum, the overall raid format for the Ruby Sanctum is very comparable. <br />
You're likely to find some random pieces of armor on par with Lich King loot, similar to the items Onyxia dropped while Trial of the Crusader was the top-tier raid. You can also expect to see some more trinkets and things of that nature. <br />
This raid will not only provide a bit of additional content to pair with the current content of patch 3.3, it will be the beginning of an advancement in the storyline for Cataclysm. <br />
The plan is to have a normal mode and a heroic mode just like Icecrown Citadel, so far there is no plan for a Sartharion +1/+2/+3-like encounter.<br />

<br />
<br />
Halion Supposed Skills<br />
These abilities are probably used by Halion. There isn't any way to confirm that before Patch 3.3.5 is deployed on live or PTR servers but they seem to be the only skills with hard mode versions. Assuming that you won't be able to activate the heroic mode on the mini-bosses, these skills are most likely used by Halion. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this is only a theory based on the game files. <br />

&lt;td style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Builds Marks of Combustion on an enemy target. When Combustion fades or is dispelled, it creates an explosion and a patch of fire proportional in size to the number of Combustion charges present at the time.

&lt;td style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Inflicts 39375 to 50625 Shadow damage to enemies in a cone in front of the caster. 45 yds. 2 sec cast&lt;/td&gt;<br />

&lt;td&gt;Soul Consumption (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74792/soul-consumption/)&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;td style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Engulfs an enemy target in flame, dealing 4000 Shadow damage every 2.0 sec. Every time Soul Consumption deals damage, it generates a Mark of Consumption charge on the target. When Consumption fades or is dispelled, it unleashes a dark explosion proportional to the number of charges present at the time. Either curse or magic removal may cleanse this affliction.&lt;/td&gt;<br />

&lt;td style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;An aura of twilight energy emanates from the caster, causing nearby enemies to suffer 6000 Shadow damage every 2.0 sec.&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;/tr&gt;<br />

&lt;td&gt;Corporeality (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74826/corporeality/)&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;td style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; I do not have a lot of details on Corporeality for the moment, but it looks like the % of Corporeality of Halion will vary during the fight. Corporeality increases damage dealt and damage taken apparently, ranging from 20~30% to 200% depending on the version of the buff. I guess it could be used by players as well, especially if Dusk Shroud (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75486/dusk-shroud/) is running throughout the fight.&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;/table&gt;<br />
&lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
Mini-Boss Supposed Skills<br />
The remaining skills only come in two versions most of the time, it means no hard modes and they are most likely the skills used during the fight against the 3 mini bosses. There is no way to link skills to a specific mini-boss and I will just keep them together.<br />

Transcripts<br />
Last but not least, here is a transcript of the dialogue with Xerestrasza of the Red Dragonflight.<br />
<br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Yell01.wav - Help! I am trapped within this tree! I require aid!<br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Yell02.wav - Thank you! I could have not held out for much longer. A terrible thing has happened here.<br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say01.wav - We believed that the Sanctum was well fortified, but we were not prepareted for the nature of this assault. <br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say02.wav - The Black Dragonkin materialized from thin air, and set upon us before we could react. <br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say03.wav - We did not stand a chance. As my brethren perished around me, I managed to retreat hear and bar the entrance. <br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say04.wav - They slaughtered us with cold efficiency, but the true focus of their interest seemed to be the eggs kept here in the sanctum. <br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say05.wav - The commander of the forces on the ground here is a cruel brute named Zarithrian. But I fear there are greater powers at work. <br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say06.wav - In their initial assault I caught a glimpse of their true leader, a fearsome full-grown Twilight Dragon.<br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say07.wav - I know not the extent of their plans heroes, but I know this: they cannot be allowed to succeed!<br />
<br />
Halion also has a couple of interesting lines. <br />
<br />
RS_Halion_Aggro01.wav - Your world teeters on the brink of annihilation. You will all bear witness to the coming of a new age of destruction!<br />
RS_Halion_Beserk01.wav - Not good enough!<br />
RS_Halion_Death01.wav - Relish this victory mortals, for it will be your last. This world will burn with the Master's return!<br />
RS_Halion_Phase2.wav - You will find only suffering within the realm of Twilight. Enter if you dare. <br />
RS_Halion_Phase3.wav - I am the light AND the darkness! Cower mortals before the Herald of Deathwing!<br />
RS_Halion_Slay01.wav - Another hero falls.<br />
RS_Halion_Slay02.wav - Ha Ha Ha!<br />
RS_Halion_Spawn01.wav - Meddlesome insects, you're too late! The Ruby Sanctum is lost.<br />
RS_Halion_Special01.wav - The heavens burn!<br />
RS_Halion_Special02.wav - Beware the shadow! <br />

Ruby Sanctum Questline<br />
A couple of quests will be added to the game to introduce the Ruby Sanctum. If you do not know who are the dragons mentioned in the quest descriptions, you might want to check the Dargonax (http://www.wowwiki.com/Dargonax) / Sinestra (http://www.wowwiki.com/Sinestra) articles on WoWWiki.<br />
<br />
Quest - Trouble at Wyrmrest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/26012/trouble-at-wyrmrest/)<br />
Objective - Speak with Krasus at Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight.<br />
Description<br />
My old friend Krasus sends word of dire happenings at Wyrmrest, in Dragonblight. His missive was brief, but it seems that there has been some sort of attack on the Ruby Sanctum beneath the Temple.<br />
<br />
Pressing business here in Dalaran keeps me from attending to the matter personally, but I have heard word of your exploits in the Lich King's Citadel and you are doubtless up to the task -- perhaps you could assist Krasus in my stead? <br />
<br />
Quest - Assault on the Sanctum (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/26013/assault-on-the-sanctum/)<br />
Objective - Investigate the Ruby Sanctum beneath Wyrmrest Temple.<br />
Description<br />
&lt;race&gt;, something terrible has transpired within the Ruby Sanctum beneath the Temple. The entry to the Sanctum is in ruins, and its guardians violently slain. We sent scouts to investigate, but they have not returned. I cannot help but fear the worst.<br />
<br />
Enter the Ruby Sanctum and discover what has befallen the home of my flight. Once we have more information, we can plan our next steps accordingly. <br />
<br />
Quest - The Twilight Destroyer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/26034/the-twilight-destroyer/)<br />
Objective - Defeat Halion and repel the invasion of the Ruby Sanctum.<br />
Rewards - Emblem of Frost (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49426/emblem-of-frost/) x 5<br />
Description<br />
This was no reckless attack, but rather a carefully orchestrated strike against the heart of the Red Dragonflight. Zarithrian, on the bluff over there, is overseeing the assault, but the true leader of this force is a brash and powerful Twilight dragon named Halion. Not since Dargonax has a full-grown spawn of Sinestra's twisted experiments been seen.<br />
<br />
Slay him, &lt;name&gt;, and then when the invasion has been fully repelled, report to Krasus regarding all you have seen here.</div></div><hr />

Let's be fair; the original model for Lord Marrowgar for a few weeks on PTR was just a random huge skeleton general, just like the ones that are activated by traps in the first hall of ICC. It's kind of early to assume the models and designs in the raid right now are the same as they'll be in 3.3.5...especially considering the patch on the PTR right now is, if I'm correct, just 3.3.3.<br />
<br />
However, I just want to say right now that I'm GLAD they're using the same design as the Ruby Dragonshrine. I always loved that place.</div></div><hr />

Makes you wonder how quickly after 3.3.3 leaves the ptr we'll see 3.3.4 or 3.3.5 enter the PTR. As for the twighlight dragon it would be nice to see them touch it up a little more, add some new scale patterns to differensate it from the diffrent flights. Still looks cool though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Knowing Deathwing, he probably excelerated the growth rate of the twilite dragons to reach maturity faster. If i'm correct in thinking, normaly it takes like 100 years+ or something for a dragon to grow that size, and concidering how fast the origniel twilite dragon (Dargonax from Night of the Dragon) grew to full size in about afew days...<br />
<br />
Plus concidering how many twilight dragons we are going to kill in Cat, he's going to need them to grow fast to repopulate them.</div></div><hr />

...you mean the Ruby Dragonshrine? Both areas belong to the red flight, it makes sense :) Just like OS is like the Obsidian Dragonshrine.<br />

They could just be planting the seeds for his return to the minds of people...that would explain the doom cults popping up in Stormwind and Orgrimmar, at least if the datamining says it. That's probably just me being far-fetched at 4 in the morning.<br />
<br />
Of course, it's probably referring to Lady Sinesta, the only mate to survive Deathwing's...uh...mating after his transformation. Because she's the dragon that's forming the Twilight Dragonflight, and she knows that Deathwing is still alive, I would assume the Twilight Dragons know about Deathwing's return, as well, and are probably avidly preparing for it.<br />
Actually, if WoW Wiki is a good source to this, the Obsidian Sanctum was used as a place for the twilight eggs that Sinesta was working on...and Deathwing himself had a hand in this. So if this is true, that means that we actually have a bit more motive to go into the Ruby Sanctum than you'd think...they're trying to strike back at us for killing their eggs by attacking the only flight that really has a hand in our future; the Reds. So trying to take out the Red Dragonflight would make Deathwing's return incredibly destructive.<br />
<br />
Actually, this might make the Twilight Dragonflight a sort of Vrykul for Cataclysm...the biggest new part of the Big Bad's armies that has the most potential for fleshing out in this expansion. I can also bet that Sinesta will be either a raid boss or very close to one in Cataclysm, probably in the Deathwing raid or a final raid boss in her own right. She's the mother of Onyxia and Netharian, after all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW what's up with the terrible voice acting.. is it just me?<br />
<br />
<br />
It &quot;pains you&quot;? What does that mean? <br />
Top guilds are like top athletes or top students or top anything. They are dedicated and passionate about what they do AND it pays off in terms of how fast they can down a boss. <br />
Imagine a boss that took like a month for the top guilds to kill, now imagine how many million wipes and how many millions keyboards got broken from more casual guilds beating their head against that same boss, that in the end, only 3% manage to kill. How fun is that? <br />
Its great for all the fanatics that live in wow more than in IRL (theres alot of them sadly) but for the rest, it sucks. <br />
<br />
There needs to be a balance between pugability and total dedication. In the past, total dedication, slavery to blizzard and wow was the only way to come even close to a decent raidgroup. <br />
Wow has become more and more individualistic and less group-oriented wich is good. Now you can pug ICC/toC, even though it still fails 9 times out of 10, atleast you have a shot at it. A little taste of epicness. <br />
<br />
The thing is, the human mind will always find a way to overcome a game mechanics, organization makes perfect in wow and the most organized, yet very few top guilds manage to kill the bosses very fast. If organization and dedication wouldnt pay off, then whats the use of even beeing in a top guild? <br />
<br />
The reason bosses go down so fast i PTR, top guilds can practise to perfection even before the encounter is live! <br />
Remove PTR is the best way to get back to the challenge. period.</div></div><hr />

But aren't those Doom cults BEFORE Halion? D: They were found for 3.3.3 with the retaking of gnomer/Echo Isles. Perhaps They are all working really closely with their master/boss/leader wtfever he is, sounds like they are trying to gather followers and weaken any form of &quot;resistance&quot; aka the reds before Deathwing makes his profound entrance that devastates the world.

She died shortly after that point. She was collecting the eggs to make the twilights and in the end it killed her. :&lt; I think it was in night of the dragon or whatever that book was titled. I never got it myself. It's on wowwiki though.<br />

He said a surprise for Azeroth. So he was probably talking in a Role Playing way.<br />
Seems like an interesting Raid, though I am afraid that the Hard Mode will be something like the TotGC Beasts encounter (aka, limited time to defeat the bosses). However, they might be able to make it more interesting than that.</div></div><hr />

How about the Twilight Dragonflight (http://www.wowwiki.com/File:Twilightdragonflight.JPG) then.<br />

Meh voiceacting overall... sounds really &quot;read-off&quot; to me... ah well, we'll have to wait and see how it comes across in a raid setting.<br />
<br />
And finally, a boss all Paladins can relate to, ;D Why purple? Why not that cool crystalline blue the twilight drakes in OS/the 25man 3D-mount are? It says he is a Twilight Dragon, but his model is clearly of the chromatic flight. How is that consistent?</div></div><hr />

Twilight dragonflight is purple &amp; is a creation of the black dragonflight. Halion &amp; his 3 lesser brethren are examples of that flight. Deathwing continued the expirement of his fallen consort Sinestra.<br />

lolwhat? The one in Searing Gorge, and the one in the cave are black...because they're Black Dragonflight, not Twilight. Only Twilight dragons currently in the game are the ones in OS, and they're shades of dark purples, blues, and reds.</div></div><hr />

* RS_Xerestrasza_Say06.wav - In their initial assault I caught a glimpse of their true leader, a fearsome full-grown Twilight Dragon.<br />

no shit... its the ruby sanctum after all.. and you cant expect them to come up with brand new models atleast they did one new model^^</div></div><hr />

That's probably just me being far-fetched at 4 in the morning.<br />
<br />
Of course, it's probably referring to Lady Sinesta, the only mate to survive Deathwing's...uh...mating after his transformation. Because she's the dragon that's forming the Twilight Dragonflight, and she knows that Deathwing is still alive, I would assume the Twilight Dragons know about Deathwing's return, as well, and are probably avidly preparing for it.<br />
Actually, if WoW Wiki is a good source to this, the Obsidian Sanctum was used as a place for the twilight eggs that Sinesta was working on...and Deathwing himself had a hand in this. So if this is true, that means that we actually have a bit more motive to go into the Ruby Sanctum than you'd think...they're trying to strike back at us for killing their eggs by attacking the only flight that really has a hand in our future; the Reds. So trying to take out the Red Dragonflight would make Deathwing's return incredibly destructive.<br />
<br />
Actually, this might make the Twilight Dragonflight a sort of Vrykul for Cataclysm...the biggest new part of the Big Bad's armies that has the most potential for fleshing out in this expansion. I can also bet that Sinesta will be either a raid boss or very close to one in Cataclysm, probably in the Deathwing raid or a final raid boss in her own right. She's the mother of Onyxia and Netharian, after all.<br />
<br />
<br />
aside from the fact that sinestra got killed by her own creation because the first twilight dragon was unstable and if recall correctly it devoured her or atleast drained her life force.</div></div><hr />

lol It's so true, Personally I don't mind the model reuses, and I don't think the Voice acting is that bad, as it's not actually meant to be listened to in a straight shot like it was. People need to complain less IMO, the Interwebs has turned to many people into whiny bitches.</div></div><hr />

Yes. She is. She died in the book, Night of the Dragon.<br />
<br />
The events of Night of the Dragon (basically introducing us the concept of the Twilight Dragonflight) happen after the Burning Crusade arc.<br />

When Sinestra visited Overlord Mor'ghor, it was BEFORE the events of NotD.<br />

I definitely agree with you, Drawz. Mmo-champion.com has always been my source of all information that is WoW. BB and his mmo-champion.com team have been pretty accurate for the most part when it comes to news and stories that involves WoW. I would like to see anyone website, besides the actual WoW website, that is this accurate when it comes to leaked information. They have hit alot of the stuff in the head with a nail. Granted this is leaked information and sometimes alot of it isn't 100% accurate at first. But, at least it is within the realm of what the later released news news is. My compliments to BB and the mmo-champion.com staff. Keep up the great work!</div></div><hr />

but i dont understand the whole qq over halions model(so what hes purple), blizzard made him look like a DRAGON. and his head and all his features are unique(horns, scales, teeth, wings, tail). <br />

<br />
<br />
Agreed. I'm REALLY hoping that the Ruby Sanctum isn't all we're getting out of the Chamber of Aspects though. Would be really great if they opened up the Bronze, Azure, and Emerald Sanctums as well and used each of those as a starting point for all the cataclysmic changes in the... um... Cataclysm lol. <br />
<br />
Besides, we have Nalice, Consort of the Black Dragonflight for Queen Alexstrasza (or however the hell its spelled) sitting up top there with a dialogue box that tells us &quot;feel nervous in the presence of the Black dragonflight? Well you should be. The others are fools for not attacking me here.&quot; Or something along those lines, I'm not quoting it word for word here lol. That bit of dialogue and all the Black/Twilight Flight activity going on int he sanctums always made me think that they were all going to open up as we got closer to Deathwing's return and that Nalice would be our last enemy before heading back to Azeroth and dealing with the new threats.<br />
<br />
Would also be a cool twist if Queen Alextrasza actually did end up getting killed in the last Sanctum to open, which would make Deathwing's return all the more dangerous and intense as his biggest opposition among the Dragonflights will be out of the way.<br />
<br />
But that is all wishful thinking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wouldn't. She is the GUARDIAN of all life on Azeroth. When the titans were done/satisfied with Azeroth they empowered five dragons to be stewards of the world, to guard Azeroth and protect the Titan's creations. So her death, which would suck as she is the greatest ally of the mortal races and the queen of all the flights, would not cause everyone and everything to die.<br />
<br />
Kind of like how Malygos was the guardian of magic and hidden arcanum. His death didn't turn every class in melee.<br />
<br />
All that aside, with the Cataclysm previews I see that she clearly isn't dying anytime soon lol. But to be fair my original post was well before all that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's to hoping that doesn't happen...<br />

BTW what's up with the terrible voice acting.. is it just me?<br />

So for every HoT tick, this would AoE heal and additional 356?</div></div><hr />

They're still going to need them... They'll be 2ndd best in slot. And I'm sure still best in slot for people who don't use ArP effectively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If my memory doesnt fail me, even the fel orcs from shadowmoon valley had some comunication with no other than sinestra herself and also knew something about Deathwings return. As the inteligent dragon aspect he is, i dont belive that he will just decide to pump out of the ground in cataclysm, his followers will be ready to receive him. They were allrdy preparing themself in BC as you can see. Deathwings return is a huge &quot;behind stage&quot; campaign that has been prepared for a looong time and Halions attack, as a sign of this, is not an exception.</div></div><hr />
