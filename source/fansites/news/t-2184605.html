Oh god, this is hilarious. They nerfed the worst new trait for Affliction. Thank god Destro seems the way to go in Tomb. These developers are monkeys.</div></div><hr />

I'm confused. Does Vivify now affect 3 secondary targets or not?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, the new changes to the Mistweaver legendary feet make Vivify hit an extra target, as such they had to increase the target cap for Vivify from 3 to 4.</div></div><hr />

You're right! I missed that. Thanks!<br />
<br />
A bit of a letdown, to be honest... Mistweavers could use some baseline love, even though the Legendary sounds quite good. I'm still waiting for them to give MW's some utility or a niche to make them more wanted.</div></div><hr />

Can't please em all, what would make you come back would probably run just as many people off.</div></div><hr />

Better itemization would be a big draw for me. Tossing crit as a 3rd stat on sub-par warrior legendaries isn't better. Oh well. At this point, I'll have to wait and see how 8.0 works out I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that should be 'increased' not 'reduced'. Either that or DHC just got the hardest nerf of any legendary to date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems like a fair tradeoff, 35% armor nerf for a 10% flat damage reduction buff :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
You realize he's talking about the intake of magic damage as a whole on warriors right? adding 20% to something that's on a 25 second cd isn't doing much for them on bosses that only trucks out spell damage the entire fight, on top of on the offchance there is a chance something hits you during that time that you can reflect, you lose the entire reduction of damage altogether.<br />
<br />
&quot;before i hear the QQ ignore pain op should work&quot; it really doesn't do much for you in mythics on said bosses where other tanks gets % reduction most of the time, warriors get flat reductions most of the time. aside from being god tanks against physicals and garbage to magic, you have every other tank which are decent at both and 1 tank that's god of both. which is the one i'm playing. Druids op</div></div><hr />
