The fight against the Lich King<br />
There isn't many details on this fight, I'm not really holding back any information it's just that most of the elements aren't implemented yet. <br />
<br />
The last screenshot of the Frozen Throne I posted was on the first day of PTR and showed a very early version of the Throne (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/icecrownraid_03.jpg). The model was eventually updated and this is how it looked in later PTR builds: <br />

<br />
I'm not sure if this is the final model, but it looks better than what I posted a few months ago. The fight will also most likely feature the &quot;Frostmourne&quot; room of the citadel, it was also slightly modified since the last time I posted. (The video is the early version, the screenshots are from PTR builds released a few weeks later)<br />
<br />

<br />
The only thing we know about the fight is from the Blizzcon where it was revealed that a part of the Frozen Throne will collapse after each phase. The screenshots below shows the throne before / after the 4 external parts collapsed. <br />
<br />

<br />
And that's it for the fight, we'll probably have to wait for the patch before we get more information on that. <br />
<br />
<br />
The death of the Lich King<br />
Yup. Sorry. The Lich King is going to die. Blizzard didn't have any problem killing Kael'thas, Illidan, Kael'thas, Lady Vashj, or even Kael'thas and it won't be any different for our old friend Arthas. <br />
<br />
It doesn't mean that the Frozen Throne will stay empty, Arthas will be replaced and a new character will take his place ... <br />
<br />
HR_Uther_Alliance06 - There is... something else that you should know about the Lich King. Control over the scourge must never be lost. Even if you were to strike down the Lich King, another would have to take its place. For without the control of its master, the scourge would run rampant across the world, destroying all living things.<br />
HR_Uther_Alliance07 - A grand sacrifice by a noble soul.<br />
HR_Uther_Alliance08 - I do not know, Jaina. I suspect that the piece of Arthas that might be left inside the Lich King is all that holds the scourge from annihilating Azeroth.<br />
<br />
There isn't any official information about that, it is commonly admitted that Bolvar Fordragon will step up and become the new Lich King to prevent the destruction of Azeroth by the Scourge. <br />
<br />
The rumor first appeared when Blizzard pushed a new model named &quot;Lavaman&quot; in the PTR files, showing a character identified by many users as Bolvar Fordragon (the Immolated Champion in the Yogg-Saron event of Ulduar)<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/december/bolvarlavaman_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/december/bolvarlavaman.jpg)<br />
<br />
Blizzard eventually &quot;removed&quot; the model from later PTR builds by patching the files to make them blank (= 0 Byte). <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
It's time for another wave of people insulting me! If you're still reading this news I will assume that you do not care about spoilers. <br />
<br />
Yes, Bolvar is the new Lich King.<br />
Patch 3.3.x (most likely 3.3.2) should be released before the end of January, it will also include the cinematic cutscene (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/patch-3-3-cutscene-blue-posts/) mentioned earlier and the ending of Icecrown Citadel will be spoiled at this point.<br />
This patch will also include the Season 8 Gear, if Season 7 lasts 17~18 weeks like the 3 previous seasons you can expect the patch mid-january<br />
Blizzard usually starts their Arena Season a few weeks before the last tier of PvE content is unlocked. Expect to fight Arthas in early/mid February<br />
<br />
Once again, there is nothing official here and I could be wrong and I'm sure it will eventually happen at some point. Hopefully I'll get lucky once again.<br />
<br />
Also please refrain from discussing this on the official forums to not spoil the event for people who want to discover things by themselves. <br />
<br />
Small reminder, Invincible's Reins (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4625/invincibles-reins/) will most likely drop from the Lich King. (Heroic Mode, probably) <br />

how can an unorganized mob be more dangerous than a highly trained army led by powerful and skilled generals (or king)?<br />

<br />
When you first walk into ICC, there's a dialogue between Bolvar and the Lich King. The Lich King is yelling at Bolvar to give up, and Bolvar refuses to give in to the Lich King. That's what wowwiki is referring to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think any of us with half a brain figured Bolvar is taking over as the new LK (even though I threw out some crazy ideas for conversation's sake). This will be a very epic moment in lore and the implications have the potential to be huge. Hopefully Blizz doesn't jsut write it off as.....<br />
<br />
/Lich King Dies to 10 scrubs<br />
<br />
/Bolvar appears.<br />
<br />
Bolvar: Lawl, I got on fire, I iz Lich King Naow!<br />
<br />
If Bolvar still has his soul and his strong will AND he is leading the Scourge then there is a lot of potential to drastically change the world of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another thought I had is that maybe this vision of Uther is potential (yeah I realise i use that word a lot) forshadowing. Maybe after being freed from Frostmourne he could be a questgiver (in ghost form of course) or something in a new Cata Alliance city. To even it out and avoid QQ maybe... a cleansed Ner'zhul (or Draenosh Saurfang, but thats really not as epic) or something could do the same thing at a Horde city.<br />
<br />
I'm just spouting pure speculation here, but that's how my brain works. I prefer to talk about lore and imagine possible story lines, as opposed to crying about nerfs or game mechanics.</div></div><hr />

yeah. considering there are 5 rabid dogs or 5 trained dog (with the single goal to kill me), i guess i would go with matti</div></div><hr />

Not going to happen. Sorry.<br />
<br />
1) Ner'zhul is DEAD. Vanished. Pwned. Arthas destroyed him when he became the LK. He does not exist in any form any more.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Even if his soul was around, and he wasa 'cleansed', he would STILL be an evil bastard. Even before he was LK, NEr'zhul was an A-hole.</div></div><hr />

i know what wowwiki is referring to. <br />
but a: i dont think arthas is trying to break his will to make him become new lich king.<br />
and b: i dont think bolvar is resisting for so long just to meet jaina and uther saying : hey dude, you wanna be new lich king ?</div></div><hr />

You know that a trained dog is going to kill you....or attempt to. An untrained dog, with no control, but the same instinct can attack at any time, randomly, when you least expect it.<br />
<br />
Additionally, ask anyone that runs a team of people. Chaos is the most destructive force. Chaos is hard to rectify. Chaos is unpredictable. Unpredictability is the hardest thing to deal with.</div></div><hr />

After the goblin / worgen spoilers i wouldn't dare to distrust you :p<br />
<br />
I am alittle &quot;sad&quot; that Arthas will die...he was kinda the biggest evil in my mind, having only started in wc3<br />
Was hopping we would see some lore about him getting back his mind, dealing with what he done...trow in a twist of his sister maybe.<br />
<br />
And yea, i know most people say its only arthas controlling the LK and that he can see everything clear - but he cant, since the frostmourne corrupted his mind long before he become Lich King.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, i would kinda rather have the scourge come charging for us - I say LET THEM COME! <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
i think the correct example would be to say<br />
<br />
10 rabid vs 1 trained. <br />
<br />
as i understand it, the lich king doesn't use all of hes army, if we kill him, they all go rampart. <br />
taking on some random or a few scourge from time to time sure, but all of them at the same time?</div></div><hr />

You are right. I just couldn't think of anyone on Horde side thatt is of equal awesomenss to Uther and is was killed or related to Frostmourne. Suarfang Jr. as cool as he was for like five seconds doesn't come close to the Lightbringer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess lich kings lewt table will be like illidans with a few extra ..<br />
<br />
Staff / shield / 2 handed sword / caster mace / some kind of bow or gun or crossbow / some trinket specific to arthas like skull of guldan was to illidan.<br />
<br />
Since they wont give the masses a frostmourne i would love to see something arthas specific to drop like maybe his skull belt or sheepskin skull plated leggings or something.</div></div><hr />

Surprised no one stated this instead of going in on rabid dog analogies, but as Uther stated; the &quot;real&quot; Arthas is a dwindling presence in the back of the Lich King's head. Not strong enough to take over, but it's what's keeping him from unleashing full force and destroying Azeroth.<br />

The way I see it is with Arthas leading it is &quot;controlled chaos&quot; but with out his rule... well it would be like 28 Days Later. All the undead would go totally chaotic. All the undeads we run into would no longer patrol. They'd just run about killing everything.</div></div><hr />

By the way, it's never been said, that Bolvar will start war with anyone, even though it's likely he will support horde/alliance in Cataclysm against Deathwing.<br />

Of course not, it's ridiculous how you can imagine that Oo Arthas tries to break Bolvar to get another strong general for the scourge. Bolvar will very likely offer himself to be the new LK, what should he do else being a lava man?</div></div><hr />

Maybe there's still gonna be the spirit of the old Lich King somewhere in the helm or whatever, so he'll have some problems doing anything other than just keeping a clear head. That'd pretty much explain it.</div></div><hr />

But that's just my opinion (and why do the &quot;noble&quot; people with a &quot;strong heart&quot; have to be Alliance and was Saurfang Jr. so easily broken..?)<br />

Sure hes planning something, but for now, the world is safe, without a master the Scourge would be unleashed upon the world.<br />
<br />
Also, if/when Bolvar becomes the Lich king he wont go all nicey nicey on everyone, he'd just be adding his own personality into the Being that is the lich king, becoming the third of the bunch.<br />
I bet that the second he becomes the Lich King hed go all quiet, walk up to the throne, sit down and tell everyone to leave, then he'd just sit there pondering for years, Hiding the Immense internal struggle between the three of them. <br />
<br />
The world wont be safe, but at least the scourge would be contained once again.<br />
Im betting they'll make a cameon in Cata to help the united forces of Azeroth somehow, Seeing how saving the world seems like something they'd agree on. Just my guess anyway.</div></div><hr />

That was one of the only parts NOT confirmed by Blizzard, hence Thrall might not become what Boubou thought.<br />

<br />
If you go to the dungeons and raids tab, and go to the Fall of the Lich King section, you'll see that there are many counters for boss &quot;kills&quot;. Sindragosa Kills, and Putricide Kills. So you're probably saying, &quot;So what Dart? They have that for every other boss too&quot;. That would be right, except it's not true for the Lich King. Instead of &quot;kills&quot;, it says &quot;Victories over the Lich King&quot;.<br />
<br />
Obviously I'm just going out on a whim here, but I'm not so sure we kill the Lich King entirely.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elementium</div><div class="date">2009-12-27, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there's plenty of evidence as to other new lich kings as well, the DK chain suggests Darion has a big part to play, that and Tirion is also incredibly noble (and old) so I have no doubt that a expansion with his focus in the forefront would end with him making that sacrifice (remember he has no family and was a hermit for a long time).<br />
<br />
Aside from a shiny (although on fire) new model for Bolvar I'm not convinced he's the new lich king. He just spent the entire expansion being tortured so he wouldnt become a death knight, he's now infused with the red dragons flames (which give life remember?). <br />
<br />
We'll see but I think the chances for someone else to become the new lich king is pretty high. Plus does blizzard ever do the obvious? well yeah.. I guess they do.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darealhybrid</div><div class="date">2009-12-27, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would you compare Dead and Living to trained or Rabid dogs? They're not the same thing. If a rabid dog killed a trained dog the trained dog would be dead. Not converted into a rabid dog.<br />
<br />
If there were 1,000,000 scourge going against a battalion of 1,000,000 foot soldiers, the battalion would retreat. Logically, if you were in the battalion you'd be fully aware that if you die you'd be fighting your friends/family. If your friends/family die, you'd be fighting them. That's how the scourge works. The only thing that would keep the foot soldiers fighting would be knowing that if they don't fight they'd die, and so could their families. They know full well of the dangers of becoming a scourge.<br />
<br />
Now if the 1,000,000 foot soldiers had supplies to keep them going for a few months they could effectively hold off the scourge for awhile. Fatigue would screw them over because the scourge don't sleep or need to eat, do they eat? Yes, but they don't need food to survive, they eat to regenerate. Where the soldiers need food and rest. In a military setting if you're faced with this problem against a strong force of weak unrelenting enemies you'd have 1/4 of your army active at all times. Which puts the battalion at a bigger disadvantage but they'd be able to drag the battle on longer because only half of the army would be resting while 1/4 is fighting and the other 1/4 is preparing, instead of 100% fighting getting fatigued then the scourge just over running them while they retreat.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm aware the only ones immune to being killed by the scourge and not coming back are Paladins. And Bolvar wasn't killed by the scourge. He was killed by a biologically enhanced weapon made by the Forsaken, which was designed to kill both the living and the undead. So in essence Bolvar is still able to be tortured by Frostmourne because Bolvar was ripped from his Light Blessed body and wasn't retrieved by the Naaru(The Light). Which would negate any Yin/Yang forces of the Light for Body and Soul(Pretty sure Yin and Yang means Body and Soul but I'm using it in terms of good and evil). If any of us could speak Draconic we could possibly be able to figure out why exactly Alexstrasza burned his body. I think it was because she knew that Bolvar's spirit was no longer contained in that body and it could be turned against us. She didn't burn Saurfang's body to a crisp.<br />
<br />
As for Bolvar becoming the new Lich King. I don't want to believe it. My reasoning being that he's not really suited for the job. Yeah he was a military commander for the Alliance, but he's not a scourge(yet). Bolvar would have to do something pretty unholy to be corrupted by the taint of the scourge. Like kill his own father. Which I'm not too good on the Ashbringer lore but didn't Darion kill his father? And Arthas killed his father. They're the only two Paladins I know of that were converted into scourge besides the 4th Horseman.<br />
<br />
If anything I think Alexstrasza will just destroy the Undead control and have the rest of the the Red Dragon flight on cleanup duty. She is the Life Binder after all. Maybe even have a cut scene of her saying goodbye to Bolvar, before she turns him into like a tree or something.</div></div><hr />

I don't know. Occam's Razor: The simplest explanation is usually right. <br />
<br />
Blizzard is usually pretty good about throwing little hints that we often just overlook. I'm not saying we won't &quot;kill&quot; the body, but I'm not so sure the spirit of the Lich King will be defeated completely.</div></div><hr />

But I didn't think on what would happen with the scourage when that was done.<br />
<br />
I also think honestly that Mal'ganis will play SOME part somewhere along the line of the Final battle with &quot;The Lich King&quot; Be it like Akama in BT Illidan fight, (doubtfull) or like Maiev (more likely)<br />
<br />
As we never truely defeat Mal'ganis be it COS or anywhere else in WOTLk at this time.<br />
<br />
As for Bovar or Thrall becoming the new LK, I am of two minds. Blizz never gave us 100% on what will become of Thrall, and we have yet to see what became of Bolvar beyond him screaming in the start of ICC.<br />
I was truley shocked that we killed Saurfang the Younger, for once I learned he was a boss in ICC I assumed we would somehow free him, or lift a 'curse', even as an alliance killing such a name/hardcore npc was a shock...</div></div><hr />

If you do the quest chain in IceCrown you will run into him again :) (Dunno if its considered a spoiler so I wont post it)<br />
Unless I am truely mistaken (Ive only done it three times..) and it is another &quot;image of the past&quot; to me it seemed that it was not, that it was the here and now.</div></div><hr />

No, you're right, and by his exit dialogue, I would expect him to be back in some way:<br />
<br />

No, there were two Mograine brothers, Darion and Renault, Darion is the leader of the Death Knights, Renault is the Morgraine you find in Scarlet Monastery, he is the one who betrayed and killed his father, Darion was the brother who saved his father by sacrificing his own soul by piercing his own heart with the Ashbringer (who of course was then pwned by Kel'thuzad by being made into the undead) &gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It all makes sense. Introduced in this expansion for one purpose: To be the new Lich King.<br />
(Upon doing the Death knight starting area quests) You learn that Arthas has a vendetta to kill Tirion. Why? Thoughts about his future? Kill him now and save his job later? Exactly.<br />
With Tirion at the helm (or should I say, wearing the helm?) his mind can fight the darkness of Frostmourne, remaining uncorrupted by it, using the light in an eternal battle. Sure, it holds the scourge at bay, There won't be any super serious threat spawned by them in the future, and this chapter of the game is closed. <br />
<br />
Tirion Fordring for the new Lich King!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Bolvar will have his own Quel'Delar quest to fix the blade, don't worry.<br />
<br />
BTW, people who still believe that an organised Scourge is worse than a disorganised scourge....can we just look back at the Zombie event from pre-Wrath and see that the chaos that ensued from that one time event was a clear demonstration of how powerful a disorganised Scourge can be.<br />
<br />
However, the organised force versus a disorganised force of equal size is a very valid arguement, but the scourge is significantly larger than that of the unliving. Plus, they don't have a subscription fee.<br />

Granted its just his speculation but isn't that what this entire thread is and ontop of that its something blizzard wrote so I'm more inclined to believe their speculation to be the accurate one.<br />
<br />
Anyway LK with a wee bit of good Arthas inside keeping the army from washing over the world in a wave of bone and steel vs LK dead and that bit of Arthas dead with him and scourge running amok through azeroth in unrestrained fury.<br />
<br />
I'd say the latter is much worse and that the scourge does indeed need a leader to prevent said event from happening. I'm curious to see what would come of the scourge later though however. If it remains a force of neccesary evil under bolvar where would he get his minions I doubt neither the Horde or Alliance would be too thrilled about him reanimating their soldiers. Also it is a giant army of undead just how long can they remain under control? World of Warcraft: Bolvar is Pissed, Featuring the new Hero Class Dark Rangers? Hell if it means I get a hunter class minus the pet I'll take it thats for sure.</div></div><hr />

He's been in the Eastern Plaguelands where very few people knew about him. Kill a few animals, find him a few things. Yeah, definitely a riveting, groundbreaking storyline.

1) Ner'zhul is DEAD. Vanished. Pwned. Arthas destroyed him when he became the LK. He does not exist in any form any more.<br />

2) Even if his soul was around, and he wasa 'cleansed', he would STILL be an evil bastard. Even before he was LK, NEr'zhul was an A-hole.<br />

I don't know who will be the new Lich King, but whoever it is, I think they are going to be so weak that they can't completely control the scourge.<br />
They'd just let them continue what they are doing now, and only keep them from making any big moves, destroying all living and such.</div></div><hr />

2 things, first, I asked you to define &quot;introduce&quot; for a reason. The literal interpretation was that he wasn't in the game world before.<br />

I think what you've just demonstrated is just how poor storytelling was in vanilla, rather than the actual substance of the story. The bulk of the storytelling in vanilla involved reading the quest log, and the occasional speach. Not very involving for the player. Admittedly, the Tirion questline went beyond this, which explains why I am being a bit irksome to your reply when you simply could've said &quot;introduced as a figurehead character within the lore&quot;, but no, instead you demonstrate a lack of knowledge and the inability to be civil.

<br />
I wasn't being uncivil to you, I was bashing the storyline. While it did tell a story, and give you something that was supposedly &quot;greater&quot; than the usual quests that were in Vanilla, I don't think that alone made him a figurehead. Most people didn't even know he existed there, because they were either already level 60 before EPL and never bothered, or never went up there during exploration to find him. He wasn't as widely known as some of the other characters. <br />

There's been hardly a whisper of Bolvar since he died. I don't think the Yogg-Saron vision was meant to show anymore than the fact that he's been torturing the spirits of Saurfang/Bolvar. <br />
<br />
I really don't think Bolvar has had enough presence since the Wrathgate for him becoming the Lich King to be anything more than a random cop-out that ignores all of the build-up in other directions. So suddenly Bolvar becomes a noble being capable of controlling legions of undead when the summary of his job in WoW so far has been to stand in Stormwind just because he's afraid that someone's going to kill/kidnap the young king, and when daddy shows back up his job becomes so meaningless that he's sent to the Wrathgate where he dies?<br />
<br />
Tirion would be a much better choice; his entire Wrath presence (in which you did quest lines/missions for him) is centered solely around stopping the Lich King. He's one of the first five Paladins and right now in the WoW world is the Paladin standard. Lorewise to me nothing represents a Paladin more than sacrifice, and what's a greater sacrifice than taking on the burden of having to maintain the Scourge for eternity?<br />
<br />
Either way, the whole situation smacks of the Tal Rasha story from Diablo/Diablo 2 to me and doesn't exactly seem original.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad Arthas is dead (even though I don't believe Illidan actually died, as you never loot a body part of his and he still has the last vial of water from the Well of Eternity).<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Arthas exists just as much as Ner'zhul does. When they merged, both Arthas and Ner'zhul ceased to be. They became The Lich King. We're fighting The Lich King. &quot;Arthas&quot; and &quot;The Lich King&quot; despite popular belief are not interchangeable terms.<br />
<br />
And you can see the models of The Lich King's loot in the modelviewer. I didn't look much, but I do know that he drops a dagger.</div></div><hr />

Bad ending is if you kill the Lich King in normal heroic mode, all you get is him getting killed, Fordring telling you &quot;There must be something missing, oh by the way,hard mode unlocked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Great ending (you see who becomes the next lich king) is if you kill Lich King in hard mode and explore 200.6% of the castle.</div></div><hr />

He's got too much emotion tied up in fighting the Lich King/Arthas and the Scourge. He couldn't see himself as controlling what he's been fighting for so long. He'd go mad, than then we'd have a brand new Lich King, one that knew how to use an army.<br />
<br />
While Bolvar is a trained soldier, he's now seen what the Scourge does - from the inside. While he's more aligned with the Aliiance than the Horde, he sees them as a rival, and not an enemy. The banter he trades with Saurfang in the Wrathgate cutscene is proof of this. He respects his opponents on the battlefield. He's not a huge player for any faction, unlike Jaina, Sylvanas, and Tirion.<br />
<br />
As to the broken Frostmourne - it's a weapon that Ner'zul used to draw Arthas to him. It's not a part of the Lich King. And if it's broken or shattered, then it can't draw anyone else - or be used by the Lich King.<br />
<br />
My guess - Bolvar shatters Frostmourne, so that he's not tempted to use it.</div></div><hr />

No.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What if we see more than one Lich King before it settles on the next long term one? Say, phase 1 and 2 are against Arthas, who then dies. Phase 3 would then be against the next person who takes up the helm and is easily corrupted. We kill them (easy way to get rid of a lore character they don't want hanging around in Cataclysm), then the cutscene plays, leaving us with the ending for the expansion and the new permanent Lich King.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because obviously Blizzard loves Arthas so much to have the grand boss of the expansion to die and be replaced in one fight? And after he dies, Sergeant Jenkins runs out of the army, grabs the helm, then jams it on his head? Players casually punt him off the Frozen Throne?<br />
<br />
Anyway, area looks cool and all, but there's nothing really ground breaking with this update. Also, I think its...unwise to say that Bolvar is the new Lich King. Personally, I think he will be, but there is no concrete evidence to proclaim such a thing as fact.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deployed</div><div class="date">2009-12-27, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is any of what I said a &quot;lack of knowledge&quot; ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Because of my interpretation of this:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He's been in the Eastern Plaguelands where very few people knew about him. Kill a few animals, find him a few things. Yeah, definitely a riveting, groundbreaking storyline. <br />
<br />
Very important thing when writting to contest something, be thorough and full with your reply as you allow people to take what you said, without taking it out of context, and then use it to demonstrate contradictions.<br />
<br />
You clearly wrote what he calls for the player to do, and you left out the significant parts of his story (infact, you're dismissive of the reasoning behind the 'fetch' quests). Now, just as I was unable to determine your knowledge of the game's lore when you said &quot;introduced&quot;, likewise I would not know what you do or do not know regarding Tirion's story in Vanilla when you leave out the key facts. In fact, I view it as strategic avoidance to make your opinion carry more weight than if you were to include it, but that's my personal interpretation and not a literal translation.<br />
<br />
Again, as per my previous reply, how you present yourself is very important in getting people to understand your perspective. Your comment about how few people know about him was spot on, for example. Very few people did know about him, just like very few people (re: alliance players) knew about the quests within the buildings in WPL before the exclaimation marks appeared on the minimap. As mentioned, storytelling in vanilla was poor. Very poor. It was detached and very uninvolved, but it was there. Dismissing it for these reasons or because &quot;hardly anyone knew he was even there&quot; is not a strong defense for your reasoning.<br />
<br />
The best way to explain your point of view is to maybe explain that someone this focal, this central to the Wrath story would HAVE to be at least slightly involved in the Cataclysm story. It would be tough to explain why someone this active would either do nothing in Cata, or would care less, because frankly, Tirion being any considerable factor in Cata would be lazy. Thrall and Varian are different because they're off to the side.<br />
<br />
Now, about the theory that Tirion will be the next Lich King, based on the opinion that &quot;he was introduced {as a figurehead] in this expansion for a reason&quot;, not strong enough. He's being used a reason to get the Horde and the Alliance to work together. The Horde respect Tirion, as too do the Alliance, and it's actually the Alliance that has more reason to dispute his reputation as he &quot;betrayed&quot; the Allaince by helping Eitrigg. As well as being the longest standing wielder of the the Light that's still alive (and not AFK, like Turalyon is), he was the only valid choice to cleanse the Ashbringer (mentioned as Frostmourne vs Ashbringer is obviously a key moment in the fight).<br />
<br />
The only reason I would support the idea of Tirion being the next LK is the same reason why I value the Bolvar theory. A noble soul that puts the importance of his peoples' survival above that of a discrimative feud. Both Tirion and Bolvar are accepting of the Horde. The only reason why Darion, the other contender for the LK's helm is due to the fact that he has already existed as a wholey corrupted soul and simply would not be able to withstand the lure of evil when directly exposed again.<br />
<br />
Bolvar and Tirion are almost on equal footing, except for two things. Tirion is vengeful. Bolvar is resisting direct corruption from the LK himself.</div></div><hr />

Spoilers are relative. Images that show players fighting within Frostmourne are going to be spoilers to people that don't want to know that event occurs. Spoilers does not mean learning something new, it's about revealing important events. Especially those that are not currently in-game.<br />
<br />
And considering the comments I've made about Vanilla's poor, uninvolved storytelling, I have to say, yes, it's you. Not JUST you, mind, but I can confirm that your opinion is not felt by all.</div></div><hr />

It's called LAVAMAN , it's body is clearly almost exploding.Deathwing has metal plates attached to his body to keep himself from going kaboom from all the power he can contain.His human form couldn't be a cute old man.<br />
Also how did Bolvar become LAVAMAN tortured by the lich king???Wouldn't , you know , make SENSE for him to be a undead abomination of some kind?<br />
I am 100% sure that is Deathwing , they removed it cause it was ment for the expa pre-event for cataclysm when Deathwing will &quot;visit&quot; and destroy some areas.<br />
Again I am convinced and know for SURE Lavaman is Deathwing.<br />
<br />
Edit: tell me ONE reason why that guy can be Bolvar?Because he's called immolated champion in Ulduar?Seriously?<br />
The lich king is known for ripping his enemies apart and putting their parts togheter to form beast aka Thaddius.Mutating them , turning them into evil dks.What I wanna say is that if he could make lava men you would have seen a undead lava guy , mob whatever by now</div></div><hr />

Who would the Immolated Champion in one of YS's brain rooms be then, according to you?<br />

Umm.. this cannot happen. For one there must always be a Lich King. There will always be scourge. Cool.. you destroyed the ones in Icecrown. What about all the others? There are still tons left in the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor.</div></div><hr />

The immolated champion is Bolvar that doesn't mean Bolvar's skin turn to lava and now has fire coming from his skull.In the worst case Bolvar is either severly injured or dead.No way Arthas would make him some kind of super hero if he will oppose him.You believe what you want ( same with boub) but just remmember me when the truth comes and I'm right :)</div></div><hr />

Yes sure.<br />
Just one more thing.So , after your theory , Bolvar got poisoned by the plague ( the same that killed thousand of warriors at wrath gate), burned alive by the entire red dragonflight , tortured by the lich king and somehow survived and became Super sayan Bolvar?I just don't buy that sorry.</div></div><hr />

Once again, there is nothing official here and I could be wrong and I'm sure it will eventually happen at some point. Hopefully I'll get lucky once again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There's no point saying that you're right or wrong, we won't know for sure until it's actually on live Realms. Nothing official has been noted yet, Before Black Temple's release I read everywhere that Illidan was supposedly going to escape while you helped yourself to a loot cache, yet he is killable. <br />
<br />
As for Lavaman, I doubt it would be Deathwing, for one why would the Lich King be torturing him in Yogg Saron's dream? And as it's been noted many times I'll say it again, the Belt and leggings of Lavaman very closely resemble Bolvar's. <br />
<br />
All we can do is wait and speculate until it's actually released. Hell for all we know Hogger could be the new Lich King!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would his human form suddenly be fiery and lava-y now when it wasn't before (Daval Prestor)?<br />
Back then he had already had the metal plates attached to his dragon form afaik.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tferr</div><div class="date">2009-12-27, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm, as I see it and from what I can imagine based on the Screenshots...<br />
<br />
First the raid enters the throne room with the LK sitting on this throne, looking all cool 'n stuff.<br />
He rises from his throne, maybe shows us Bolvar being tortured or something. Then there is a fight where a player tanks him. When he reaches a certain % he does some ability which kills everyone and sucks their soul into Frostmourne. While inside Frostmourne there are adds (evil spirits or something) that have to be tanked while the raid's dps finishes off some stationary thing to break the seal on the blade.<br />
<br />
When this thing is destroyed everyone are ported back into their bodies, but stunned for a brief intermission where Sylvanas/Jaina + Saurfang and Tirion and Darion come to your aid. LK is still tanked by a player (as a prot warrior, I really really want to be able to tank him) and the whole raid and the gang of leaders are fighting him. During this battle parts of the room is destroyed and eventually The Lich King falls to the ground, dead.<br />
<br />
Now a huuuuge horde of undead zerg out from where you came/start climbing up the sides of the citadel/out of the sky. Bolvar, who now is freed, rushes up to the fallen LK and pick up the helmet. Tirion/Darion go like &quot;WTF R U DOING!?&quot; and Bolvar goes like &quot;This is the only way the world will survive&quot; and puts on the helmet.<br />
<br />
Immediately all the attacking undead stop (who had been held off by Saurfang and Sylvanas) and begin to walk away while Bolvar is still kneeling with the helmet on his head. Tirion/Darion goes forward, but Bolvar rises and walks up to the throne, telling everyone to help themselves to some treasure chest or something, and sits down on the throne. Then he encases it in a block of ice. Tirion goes like &quot;noble sacrifice, blah blah blah.&quot; and maybe Uther's ghost comes back.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then we collect your loot and wait for the weekly reset or go try the heroic version.</div></div><hr />

So in cataclsym New Lich King and His scourge fight against Deathwing with Alliance and Horde?<br />
<br />
<br />
makes sense, so that Death Knights will continue to start at 55 under the new lich king perhaps. It would be weird if Arthas was still in the death knight starter area in control as the Lich King after you killed him. Of course I could be wrong and the quests will remain the same, which would be odd but keep the lore aspect of things intact.</div></div><hr />

I think the current Lich King wants to Conquer the world, yes, but the little piece of Arthas that remains is all the is keeping the the Lich King and scourge from totally obliterating Azeroth, like Uther said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. Taking over power is a lot more difficult than just eradicating all life. Think about the world right now, many countries have the nuclear capacity to destroy the entire earth, but they won't because that is potential power they are destroying and making their own life and goals gone. Kind of a bad example if you assume Arthas is more evil than the world leaders of today, but if is very evident Arthas would rather bring his own control and order to the world, using the scourge as a tool, rather than just ravage all life on azeroth, for example, he lets our characters go constantly because his final plan is to strengthen us before controlling us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, look at all the story beats introduced in the latest donjons.<br />
Jaina has beein dying to find her lover back &amp; give him redemption. Also, she's been hinted as guilty reg. what happened to Arthas in previous &quot;episodes&quot;. <br />
<br />
She really looks more like the perfect candidate for a sacrifice than this Bolvar guy that nobody cared about a few weeks ago. <br />
Personally, drama wise, it would be stronger if the sacrifice Uther talks about came from Jaina rather than from Bolvar (btw... Bolvar is already dead so it's not like a huge sacrifice :)<br />
<br />
I personally think Bolvar is just going to help us beat the Lich King at the very end. I see Bolvar bitting his new master when the later thought he had total control over him (a la Star Wars episode 6)<br />
<br />
Also, yes, it's alsmot sure Frostmourne is going to be destroyed. After all, it's the real evil. The one that sucked away thousand of souls, that lead Arthas north, that summoned Sindragosa. It's the tool without which the Lich King can't do anything. <br />
<br />
So, Wotlk ending looks like this to me:<br />
- Bolvar free himself from LK control &amp; help us with defeating the LK, not by killing him but by breaking Frostmourne<br />
- Frostmourne is broken. All captured souls are freed (as foreseen in the 3.3 trailer video). This includes Bolvar being freed<br />
- Jaina gives Arthas his redemption &amp; free his noble soul by replacing him on the Frozen Throne duty<br />
- The Frozen Throne is left behind as an eternal prison for the LK under Jaina soul control (which - a prison - is what it was in the beginning when Kil Jaeden jailed Ner Zul here)<br />
<br />
Of course these are only pure speculations (or BS as you prefer)</div></div><hr />

The uncontrolled Scourge would have no concern in this regard and would rather just revert to what we can only assume is the very standard &quot;zombie&quot; mindset of killing and feeding off the living.<br />
<br />
Bolvar becoming the new Lich King is definitely an interesting approach. However, I think we can expect the &quot;new&quot; Lich King to be written lore-wise as maybe a neutral entity, rather than the malevolent personality that exists within/united with Arthas. <br />
<br />
The &quot;Lavaman&quot; model makes me believe that the Life-Binder has a role to play as fire is seen as the &quot;cleansing&quot; of the corruption of the Scourge (see Wrathgate Event). This leads me to believe that the Bolvar as the Lich King will somehow retain some of his human virtues. <br />
<br />
The interesting part of this lore will be the interaction between the new Scourge and the Forsaken. I sincerely hope that come Cataclysm that Blizzard just doesn't write that the Forsaken and Scourge are now united or some crap and leave it at that.<br />
<br />
Definitely looking forward to seeing how Blizzard plays this all out and *hopefully* ties it together to better understand the events of Cataclysm. (i.e. no spaceships!)</div></div><hr />

Blizzard said this will be the end of the Lich King story. The Lich King can make scourge appear out of no where. I'm sure there's a way he ports them in. Look at the wrathgate trailer, he just thinks it and they come out of the ground.</div></div><hr />

The Forsaken, known in World of Warcraft as undead, are a race and faction of undead who broke away from the Scourge<br />
<br />
It's quite amusing that there has been twelve pages of speculating and no-one actually came up with these chances. I'm not saying here that every single one of Scrouge could break free from his (Lich King's) grasp, but it has happened and it most definitely is possible depending on the state of the LK (and will).</div></div><hr />

I wasn't being uncivil to you, I was bashing the storyline. While it did tell a story, and give you something that was supposedly &quot;greater&quot; than the usual quests that were in Vanilla, I don't think that alone made him a figurehead. Most people didn't even know he existed there, because they were either already level 60 before EPL and never bothered, or never went up there during exploration to find him. He wasn't as widely known as some of the other characters. <br />
<br />
How is any of what I said a &quot;lack of knowledge&quot; ?<br />

It's good that you claim how wrong you are, I should quote you and put it in my sig so that everyone can see how wrong people are that defy the boubouille. <br />
<br />
Alas, there are too many ridiculous people that have no real knowledge on lore speaking on how they believe Tirion will be the new Lich King.<br />
<br />
That itself is enough reason to not believe Tirion is the new lich king. Plus, I still follow the words of this guy on the PTR that I assumed to be a blizz employee that said &quot;Right as Tirion is about to put on the helmet, one we once thought dead will take one for the team&quot;</div></div><hr />

What the fuck is the point of killing the lich king, if we're just going to end up with another one? Wasn't the whole point to wipe out the scourge and END the lich king story line? But instead we get another one, who's just going to chill out and continue being evil? <br />

He suffers an irrevocable loss to his humanity after the Wrathgate but after clinging so long to his noble ways and his very soul he becomes the perfect person to take up the crown. The man who must make the sacrifice because no one else can. The man who will never have Night Elf, Human, Draenei and even the few Gnome and Dwarf babes there are ever again. The man who gives up single handedly dishing out justice and long corpse runs to any Horde raid foolish enough to try and kill him.

Bolded the part that I think will change lore-wise when Blizzard produces the end of this expansion / lore phase. I think we will see Bolvar retain some of his humanity and persona when he becomes the next Lich King, possibly through the powers of the Life-Binder (which would explain why he is Lavaman and not Iceman). At least I sincerely hope they address it, haha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It always amazes me how much debate is spawned from news like this, on topics such as lore. The fact of the matter is, the folks at Blizzard are the sole creators of the entire Warcraft story line. Regardless of any past events in their story, World of Warcraft is currently writing a new chapter in the Warcraft saga. What does this mean? Absolutely anything is possible. If they told us tommorow that the new Lich King was going to be a purple unicorn, then thats what will be written in the lore. People get hung up on previous events, sure characters like Arthas, Illidan, Lady Vashj, Kaelthas, etc are important and have a deep root in the lore of the game, but that does not mean that they should not eventually be killed off or otherwise, only to be replaced by new enemies who will write their own tale in that same story. It seems as if some people want to constantly experience one section of the game over and over, and are completely against change/updates. I for one look forward to any and all changes to the games lore. It is expanding at a brisk pace, and there is so much more to be explored.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Killala</div><div class="date">2009-12-28, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bolded the part that I think will change lore-wise when Blizzard produces the end of this expansion / lore phase.

<br />
<br />
The idea of having a lich king that's not evil seems completely ridiculous to me. If he retains goodness, why keep the scourge around at all? I guess the part I'm not getting past is why they can't be wiped out entirely - other than &quot;it would mess up too many quests&quot;. <br />
<br />
This is speculation obviously, but suppose that during the fight when Arthas' body dies, the part of the original lich king's 'soul' would be freed and wouldn't have a host, and would need to latch onto something - I think they HAVE to split during the fight, since really Arthas' body is merely a host for the LK's powers. If there's a split, we could see some sort of 'redemption' of Arthas the man right before he dies. The LK would realize that his host is about to get demolished, and seek out a different one. So say Bolvar somehow breaks free and comes to help kill Arthas, the freed soul could latch onto him, thus making them merge and crowning him the new LK. If that happened, regardless of his character he would still be evil because of the overwhelming power of the &quot;LK soul&quot;. You could take that even further and suggest that with Arthas the LK has only grown stronger, making it that much more difficult to resist corrpution if he's in your head. So the ultimate sacrifice then would be to give up your mind to invasion, or Bolvar giving up himself.<br />
<br />
Unless the original LK and Arthas are now so intertwined that they're only one being, and killing Arthas would kill them both - leaving the throne completely open and uncorrupted. That seems like the only logical way where Bolvar could retain his humanity and perhaps take the scourge in a Forsaken-like direction... but I still think the first is more likely, even if it does make the whole crusade to get rid of the lich king kind of pointless. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
It's not a matter of wanting to relive past lore, but a desire to see new lore that's consistent with the past. Throwing in new elements out of nowhere that completely ignore past events and mess with previously established lore is not only extremely frustrating, but unbelievably bad writing. Sure Blizz can do what they want, but they'd be out several billions of dollars if a purple unicorn took Arthas' place. Just sayin.</div></div><hr />

I understand what your saying, though i feel at one point or another writing new lore that is consistent with that of the past will become increasingly more difficult, and some compromises should be made. I'm sure Blizzard will try their best to please their fans as they have for so long and that we should all stay open minded.<br />

Hopefully no purple unicorns will plague Azeroth in the foreseeable future :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
the only reason why the lich king is not launching an all out attack on azeroth is because the good part of arthas inside the lk is refraining him from doing so - plus the fact that the lk lost part of his power/scourge control when illidan summoned a spell to shatter the frozen throne, but was stopped by malfurion (the same event that let sylvanas freed from the lk because of his diminishing power)</div></div><hr />

As you can see at the wrathgate when Alexstrasza is talking to the other dragon, she says something in [Draconic] and the translate is ( They must not discover the fate of the young paladin. Not yet ), Is he a human ? Dragon like Onyxia ? maybe he is still resisting the LK because he is not a human. am not sure but I think blizzard is planning to announce the fact about bolvar at the fight and maybe this is why he is gonna be the next LK because he is not human and he may be a dragon with a power that allows him to control the scourge.<br />
<br />
<br />
one more thing is that Ner`Zhul`s soul has been divided as two part , one in the armor and one in the sword as it says in the lore when KJ punished him and for that when the Frostmurne is broken it will hold Ner`zhul for a long time because the sword is his power source. I think that after Cataclysm Blizzard will return the LK assuming that he found another way to collect souls and regain his power like they did with Nefarian after we assumed that he is dead. as you can see the LK will still whisper the one who will hold Shadowmurne the new legendary axe which means that his spirit is still alive, only arthas is dead. Blizzard will do the same thing as it did with Ashbringer but most likly in different way.<br />

at the end we know nothing about the fight and how its really gonna be. Blizzard said it will be EPIC fight that no one will forget ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
By this point, I think Arthas realizes he's made a mistake; it's the Lich King, that is, the Ner'zhul (you know, the guy who made a deal with the Burning Legion to get infinite power?; yeah, him) portion, that's wreaking havoc on the world. Arthas is keeping that part in check, realizing somewhere along the way that, maybe, he's made a mistake. Maybe, in fact, he's doing it so that there's a chance to destroy Ner'zhul once and for all - especially if he's seen what Ner'zhul/the Lich King has done in his past to gain the power he has now. <br />
<br />
It takes both the helmet and Frostmourne together to be all of Ner'zhul; if the helmet portion passes to the new Lich King and the Frostmourne portion carries on in Shadowmourne, the two halves aren't as powerful as the whole. Until Arthas put on the helmet, he retained his identity and his freewill (had he not, however, he would have died, as I remember), though he had already been corrupted by his acts that he believed would 'save' his kingdom (see the RP section of Culling of Stratholme/Mission 6, human campaign WC3; and even in his early days as a death knight, he still believes he's doing the best for his kingdom - see the start of the WC3 undead campaign). If someone who wasn't that corrupted were to take up half of the spirit of Ner'zhul, they'd probably be able to manage to continue being themselves... and if Bolvar's the kind of paragon he's supposed to be, he probably can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone please explain why Arthas would hold back. Did he not want death, destruction, and total control over Azeroth. It seems its not the might of the Horde and Alliance that the Lich King is beaten, but just that Arthas is letting them come.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arthas knew in the split second before he freed the lich king that he had made a mistake, if you look at the ending cinematic in The Frozen Throne, he roars before, probably in regret, and anyway, that's probably why he's holding them back.</div></div><hr />

He has absolutely no use in conquering the world. BTW....how do the scourge sustain themselves? it's off the living...I'm pretty sure they are like zombies and just feed off the living's flesh...once everything is scourge then they pretty much have nothing to sustain themselves so they all die..the lich kings just wants everything destroyed...he has no use for control over the world lol<br />

It IS possible to kill the lichking. Hell the horde/alliance can go and kill him and leave if they wanted to. The fact of the matter is if they kill him and leave the throne empty , the scourge will be uncontrolled and go feral. So he can and will be destroyed , but he must also be replaced.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I think Darion Mograine to be a better LK candidate for a variety of reasons, the primary one being that as a former member of the Scourge, he has an intrinsic understanding the Scourge's organizational structures, as well as the meta-things at play (i.e.- the &quot;physics&quot; of Scourge magic/necromancy, the Scourge's Burning Legion origins, the mind of Frostmourne, etc.), that Bolvar has had little or no exposure to.

Blizzard isn't happy by the lack of hype surrounding fighting death wing im sure and realized having some sort of humanoid to fight is always more exciting and better for the lore.<br />

I remember actually even reading someplace that the story surrounding the lich king will blend into cataclysm. <br />
<br />
I don't know though maybe he will just be on our side, but that'd be bullshit if that pussy has a stronger will than arthas. hopefully we'll have to fight him in cataclysm and it will take until cataclysm to be able to figure out how to destroy frostmourne and the lich king.</div></div><hr />

I think that Blizzard screwed up (please hold back your surprise) in regards to the Lich King. Despite the fact that Ner'zhul was the pre-merger Lich King and his claim &quot;now we are one&quot; in the Frozen Throne, the novel had Arthas consume Ner'zhul's spirit or personality. But the question still remains as to Ner'zhul and Arthas's roles in the composition of the Lich King. This is further convoluted by most PCs addressing the Lich King as Arthas, though I would suspect that most would not know of the Lich King's true origins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I don't like this story, and it is full of fail.<br />
<br />
So the whole time it was a good thing for Arthas to be the Lich King? If it wasn't for him the scourge would destroy Azeroth? If that is the case why kill him in the first place? Since he is the check that prevents Azeroth from being destroyed.<br />
<br />
If the scourge needs their master to keep them in check, why kill their master? It just makes the Lich King looks like a fail title and a terrible enemy. If people say they want to put a &quot;puppet&quot; in place, isn't Arthas a puppet because a little side of him doesn't want to destory Azeroth?<br />

As someone else said, Arthas has always being a ass even before becoming the Lich King. Looks like Blizzard is getting desperate for storylines.</div></div><hr />

what is so hard for people to understand? yes obviously ppl are more effective with a leader. but the lich king holds back. he never lets the scourge just go all out and try to conquer the world which is exactly what would happen if he was gone. the lich king is the only thing stopping the scourge from annihilating azeroth</div></div><hr />

After the goblin / worgen spoilers i wouldn't dare to distrust you :p<br />
<br />
I am alittle &quot;sad&quot; that Arthas will die...he was kinda the biggest evil in my mind, having only started in wc3<br />
Was hopping we would see some lore about him getting back his mind, dealing with what he done...trow in a twist of his sister maybe.<br />
<br />
And yea, i know most people say its only arthas controlling the LK and that he can see everything clear - but he cant, since the frostmourne corrupted his mind long before he become Lich King.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, i would kinda rather have the scourge come charging for us - I say LET THEM COME! <br />
<br />
Nice first post - your right ^^<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty much how I feel.<br />
<br />
But, as an artist I can say that anything past WC3 or the original WoW does not count (or even TBC).<br />
<br />
So Arthas in my mind won't be dead because the saga would have never been offically finished... a bit like how so many refuse to accept the Matrix sequals. In WOTLK the complexity of Arthas just went down the toilet, lets face it.<br />
<br />
The original WC3 level where he kills the people of strat was purposely crafted to mimic WW2 legend (or truth, I'm unsure whether it was true or not). Yet play the old Strat instance in WOTLK and it purposely makes Arthas out to be the bad guy, making him say awful things which he just didn't in WC3.<br />
<br />
Very sad, I really didn't care less about space goats, but changing an interesting character to make him pure evil (INSTEAD of evil because the road was paved with good intentions, since Arthas did only ever want to save his people until he got in too deep) seriously pisses me off.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monkeydude</div><div class="date">2009-12-31, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, how about just Uther being wrong about a Lich King is needed, and Arthas dies? Would be the simplest (simpler is always better, right?) For what I know, when an undead's master dies, the undead dies aswell. My argument for this is that Tirion says that there is no part of Arthas left (the heart of Arthas quests), but Uther implies that there is a part restraining the LK. Obviously, one of them is wrong. True, Uther has been inside Frostmourne, but is that really a good source of information, being inside a blade?<br />
<br />
Of course, this is probably all wrong, but a good suggestion, I'd say. If so, Darion would be the best LK imo. He's undead already, and hasn't really any other spot than messing with the Scourge. Also, he was a paladin, and is prolly able to sacrifice himself for the greater good. About power, Arthas wasn't THAT powerful. A skilled paladin, yes, but not much compared to a lot others. Just thought I should mention it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why hastn´t anyone put the obvious at hand? <br />
<br />
What i mean? Well, IF Uther says that...there must be a lich king blabla...for what?<br />
<br />
Story please: <br />
<br />
We/i/you whatever have beaten everything from the tundra/fjord up the icc itself. everything. there is no scourge anymore, in that process we even killed an aspect (i hate you blizzard) and an old god..*sigh*...<br />
<br />
there is no scourge anymore, his army is beaten to the ground. No need for a &quot;new&quot; lich king. <br />
<br />
There would be only one plausible option, when Uther makes his pretty speech, show the possible army(!) under the ice crown in the nerubian kingdom hiding.a far strecht, but better than nothing.<br />
<br />
This only, if not it´s just a sorry excuse for a new lich king for &quot;the play&quot;, dumb as it has been with Illidan.</div></div><hr />

AS for the lore, there is still loads of more badass thingies out there, take f'eks Azhara (Donno if she's stronger than Arthas, but wouldn't surprise me), Deathwing, a pair of Old Gods and Elemental Lords and so on. There is after all coming a whole new expansion.<br />

Blizzard has made it clear several times that Arthas is not in control. When Arthas merged with Ner'zhul they became a new being entirely. Arthas is only one of many presences inside the lich king. Whatever was left of Arthas is keeping 4 of the 5 trained dogs from destroying azeroth. All 5 go rabid without a lich king killing everything. Also in reply to the story of Arthas being butchered, his descent into madness is pretty obvious and an insane Arthas is an easy target for a being requiring a host.<br />

He was easy for the previous lich king to break and make into a Death Knight, he's &quot;young&quot; even though he's dead, and reckless. Arthas' remaining love for his kingdom after all that happened to him is enough to stop the scourge from destroying azeroth, now imagine what a patriotic champion like bolvar could do, especially since the lich king can't even manage to break him like he did to Arthas</div></div><hr />

For one; he had way too many appearances in instances and his dialogue was way to detailed and lengthy. Compare him to a boss like C'Thun, his quotes and lack of speech gave him a powerful yet creepy feel. The Arthas in WoW seems to be a cocky man in an armoured suit. Another thing that ruined Arthas' presence in the game for me was when he and Sylvanas were fighting in the Halls of Reflection. His HP was too low. It made it seem like a player trying to solo a 5 man quest boss, trying and trying 'till they finally down him. Arthas has a look of fraitality in WoW. Then again maybe Blizzard did this on purpose to show that his death via 10 or 25 players is viable.<br />

I think a better example would be a punch in the face from someone who is insane just punching you to hurt you, or someone with something holding him back, like he doesn't entirely want to hurt you, he just has to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Saurfang the Younger's body was also at the Wrathgate when everything was immolated but he didn't turn up charred like the lava-man. <br />
<br />
I'd also like to think of Darion as the new Lich King...I think he'd fit the bill a little better at least.<br />
<br />
Bolvar IS deathwing. Guess why he will be so pissed in Cataclysm? Because every noob farms in for loot in ICC because he is the new lich king.<br />
<br />
no this wasn't meant seriously, but there is no reason blizzard would put deathwings &lt;new&gt; human form (the old exists at least since yogg saron) in the game now</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's already stated that the last tiny bit of paladin-arthas is keeping the scourge some what in control.<br />
So... when we kill Arthas (no comment on the word kill, its not the point) and Bolvar (again, no comment on him) will take over.. what's the use?<br />
<br />
To me it looks a little like, OK lets kill this LK, let him be replaced by somebody else who might do a beter job at controling. And then maybe, oh noes Bolvar fails, lets kill him again and lets give it another shot with a new LK...<br />
<br />
On a sidenote, similairities between lavaman and bolvar and the naked human? Sorry but it's just a plain male human model, could be any male...<br />
<br />
And then again, the thoughts about Bolvar being too much on the alliance side is seriously a good one. I'd say, Tirion is quite neutral (look at TOC where he litteraly stands between the horde and alliance) and I can't think of anyone else being so extremely filled with holy and light and all that, and his will to stop the scourge isnt bigger in anyone else.<br />
<br />
I'd say, Tirion for new LK!<br />
Destroy Frostmourne and let the Ashbringer become the new LK weapon... (since it kinda has the same story where it binds to a person blabla)</div></div><hr />

-how many arena teams win because they avoid teamwork altogether?<br />
-how many countries have won wars because they decided to attack random targets instead of having a gameplan?<br />
<br />
why are people saying they think the scourge will be MORE effective without arthas? oh well, i could care less about lore tbh, just a few thoughts<br />
<br />
<br />
Couple of things:<br />
<br />
1) Note that this entire argument is one-sided. You have a one-liner from Uther and then torrents of geeking over why it's wrong. There's no counterpoint, here, so we just don't know.<br />
<br />
2) &quot;Effective&quot; is a misleading word to use. Swarms of locusts aren't &quot;effective&quot; as individuals, and in the long-run they run out of energy and die. But the devastation that they leave behind is astounding. Without the Lich King throwing scourge ineffectively at wastelands like Tanaris and empty landscapes like Azshara and Winterspring, the Scourge would lash out with some purpose (they're not all mindless) and some randomness. They'd destroy a city or two and kill thousands, but in the end they'd probably be contained. That might be considered a higher price to pay than just installing a new Lich King who can keep them permanently at bay in Northrend....</div></div><hr />

<br />
With forsaken at hand she tends to be evil(and i'm not talking about the wrathgate/putress event or quests that demon put us on). With the hole scourge she will get out of hand fast, not to mention it is in her voice that she can't see herself as the new lich (from the HoR speech)</div></div><hr />

Maybe Deathwing breaks loose right around the time we are going to kill Arthas and takes his powers. Currently Deathwing is not any more powerful than any of the other dragon aspects so why couldn't they just take him out themselves since we will obviously have to help. He is going to need a way to one up the other side (us) so stealing the Lich kings power would seem to be a good way to do that. After all Deathwing is a fan of stealing powers.</div></div><hr />

Deathwing's had a human form, Lord Prestor, and it wasn't all lava, fire and brimstone. Nevermind Bolvar's called the 'Immolated Champion'. But fanboy however you see fit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok before i start let me say that you defenetly won the award for most random post xD<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok so. I red the post on MMO Champion...i go the link...i found out they wrote nothing more that i allreadz kinda figured out and the only new thing i found out is what the Throne was gonna look like.<br />
<br />
Now i am hudge Warcraft Lore fan....i only know the lore from Warcraft 3 but i also read a lot iof stuff on WoW wikki (i look up something i need in wow....start reading...folowing links and suddenlz i;m dissconected from the server and i spent adleast a hour and a half redin Warcraft Lore (even the one before the games even came out).<br />
<br />
NOW I WOULD LIKE TO ASK ALL OF YOU WHO ARE INTERESTED TO PLEASE READ THIS AND THEN COMMENT. DON'T JUST READ HALF WAY AND START FLAMING AND CRITISIZING! (and i knwo my spelling might not be perfect but tought...i'm born in a English speaking county).<br />
<br />
The first thing i would like to point out are the &quot;Lava Man&quot; screenshots. I would say that even if they do resemble Bolavar they still don't mean anything....heck i could make a character in WoW Model Viewer with the same face and stuff and say thats him.<br />
But like it or not we still don't know if he will take the the role as LK or no.<br />
<br />
The candidates i could pin out are the next and i will also explain my point of view why:<br />
- Tirion Fordring: All those who love WC lore and did the DK quests all know that in the battle of Lights Hope...Darions father Alexandros apears and tell him (or it was a past memory....i have to look in to it) told him taht ONE day...he will wield the ashbringer....but that day is not today. NOW. Imagine that Tirion is killed in battle or is badly woundet.....and in order to survive...he takes Frostmourne after the battle is finished. The Ashbringer returned to Darrion and with its powers he returns to his normal state....human...after all he did sacrifice himself to save the thousands of souls that are hidden under Lights Hope Chappel - if anyone dont know what was hidden there now you know - and if Bolvar Fordragon is still human he just continues his life on in Cataclysm...(or if he is undead he is somehow returned to normal)<br />
- Darion Mograine: Darion was a noble paladin himself and son to the original Ashbringer, Alexandros Mograine, who was also once a deathknight (that is actualy how the ashbringer became cirrupt in the first place, because Alexandros was betrayed and killed with his own sword, left in the Plaguelands for Kel'Thuzad to take and convert to a Death Knight....as he did with Darion; but that is Lore that we can leave for a nother time. Anyway. Darion allready being a Death Knight. To release himself oh his burden or to py for his past sins, Blizzard might have chosen him to be the new LK (since he originaly had Ashbringer and he dosent have it anymore he is just a minor character in the back). Yes there isn't much to talk about him rather and i know i could but i can't remember all the deild about him from the 4 Issue comig serries so i apologise to anyone who might be a big fan of him and is ofendet now.<br />
- Muradin Bronzebeard: Now before you freak otu and go: WHAT....A DWARF BE THE LICH KING!?!? Are you mentaly retardet or .........and so on, lets get to the Lore of Warcraft to tell you why i chose him as a candidate (allthou i doubt that will happen but istill read): Muradin was originaly sent to northerend in search of Frostmourne, to defeat the Scourge. As Arthas came to Northerend he was the one who told him aboutthe blade and leed him to it. Durning Arhases time before they went to search for Frostmourne, Muradin saw arthas do some thing that werent apropriate and should have spopped him, but he didnt. As they reached Frostmourne, Muradin told Arhas that the blade is Cursed and that they must go. But Arthas did not care, and while taking Forstmourne, he apparently killed / sacrificed Muradin, or that what we tought untill WotLK came out and all those who did the Dragonblight and Icecrown quests found out that he....somehow...survived. Now muradinw as also a noble warrior and as a dwarf he also has his pride and he might......just might in the end sacrifise himself to correct the mistake that cause all this terror in the first place (wich was tell Arthas about Frostmorne and lead him to it).<br />
- Bolvar Fordragon: From what i've read and seen...he is most likely the candidate that Blizzard chose to take over as the LK. He is a noble soul, a respected paladin and we all see that even Arthas (in Icecronw) agrees taht he has had a hard time breaking his will (and is still trying to). Now Bolvar apparently died (i don't know if he is actualy dead) in frond of the Wrath gate when WotLK came out and apparently Arthas has been braking his will since that (WoTLK -&gt; Ulduar -&gt; Building the Argent Coloseum -&gt; Argent Tournament (+5 extra weeks to unlock all the bosses) -&gt; Icecrown Citadel (28 days as even Muradin said to brake the first gate and 3 extra weeks to unlock the rest)...i mean hello...normal people woul rather submit willingly...and it might have been almost a year for us and in the time in WoW was probably a lot shorter but that is still a lot of time. A nother reason that makes you wonder is this: when Bolvar dies and Alextraza stands in front of the Wrath Gate after the Cinematic is done and you have finished the quests, she speaks with the other dragon next toher in draconic and according to to WoW Wikki and the WoW Forums she and the dragon are talking about: It is too early to tell the mortals about the paladins true faith.<br />
I mean that has got to mean that he has some purpose and after the Halls Of Reflection and Hearing his voive in IC it kind of got me wondering. Also we do not know if he is allive or allready a Undead but still has his own will. We don't know taht yet so i cant realy say...but both are possible.<br />
<br />
NOW:I did not include Sylvanas or Jaina in the Candidate list because to be honest...i jsut cant imagine them. Jaina is and will be Jaina. And i'm not being sexest but i just can't imagine her doing it....all thou we never know.<br />
<br />
Sylvanas is a totaly diferent subject. Yes she is allready a undead, and yes the has control over the Forsaken. But eversince she died, her aditude and point of view have changet since she was a High elf ranger. Nontheless the has become cruel, dark heaterd (and to beat anyone to it yes i knwo taht it is also a chance that she dosent have a heart anyomore or it might not be working....sine she is dead in a way). But over the years while thinking and planing of revenge she is not what she ussed to be, in time even if she would take the role as the Lich Queen she would eventualy be overtaken by the Power or even Frostmourne itsel...who knows what will happen to Ner'zhul's soul after arthas is dead; mabie it will jsut be surpressed and locked away in Frostmourne or mabie it will die along with Arthas. I don't know and that is something i can't predict.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So i hope that you enjoyed this &quot;litle&quot; response.<br />
And before some retared people star commenting (and i knwo there are some among you that might or want to do it just for the sake of spam) i want to clarify that i am not a 32 year old fat virgin with no life tht just sits at his computer and has no life and crapy job. I am a 18 year old High school senior who is going to graduate this year and go off to colege to study multimedia. I'm not fat (i was but that was LOOONG before i played WoW or before it even came out), participate in school sports and has a social life.<br />

The major characters that &quot;should&quot; play a role in the killing of the Lich King are-<br />
Sylvanas, Jaina, Tirion, Darion, and maybe Muradin(but who cares about this dwarf)<br />
Ok so I'm gonna go blind say and tell you that the war in Cataclysm has emerged again, which means there should be some event to it.It's also stated that Thrall is no longer the leader of the Horde, but rather the Guardian of Tirisfal. Ok so to start off with Jaina and Sylvanas.. Jaina is obsessed with the idea of saving her benevolent Arthas, and Sylvanas wants to murder him. So if we for a second think that we're in a movie, we could say that Jaina jumps infront of Sylvanas finishing arrow and dies instead of him. So the Horde Main character kills an Allince one =&gt; there is a perfect reason for a new emerged war + Thrall Loves Jaina, there is a reason for him to leave the Horde.<br />
On the other hand Tirion and Darion have to finish what they started at Light's hope chapel so, &quot;I'm just sayin&quot; that maybe Tirion is going to attack with Ashbringer, but since he is &quot;no longer on holy ground&quot; gonna get pawned, and since we all know the Dk finishing story alexandros saying &quot;its not ur time yet&quot;, maybe tirion will throw back(and die after that) the Ashbringer to Darion(aka now is his time) and then Darion tears the Lich king Into pieces :d.<br />
<br />
About who becomes the new Lich king, I see only two characters eligible - <br />
Darion<br />
Bolvar<br />
<br />
Darion is a Death Knight, done alot for the fight against the lich king + bla bla bla<br />
Bolvar ( I don't see what's so specific about him, he's not a &quot;huge&quot; lore character, he's just been soloing my onyxia raid quest when i was 60, that's all )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arthas Fight should go something like this. <br />
<br />
Phase 1: Convoluted tank and spank followed and or preceded by cut seen(assuming they dont cause lag...then an in game script) Arthas does super move taking everyone to 1hp and incompasitated aka dead but not really followed by the intervention of the Green Dragon Valithiria....BOOM! Raid-wide rez animation followed by a uber hot that ticks for remaining and start of...<br />
<br />
Phase 2: Preceded or followed by Intro of Tirion, Mograine and some other OP NPC's who cannot solo Lich King. Don't worry the hot is uber but so are the waves of Scourge you must fight. Necromancers, Aboms, Skele Giants, Skeles maybe even some Deathwyrms. Kill 10 waves then you are over whelmed. Maybe 5 waves spawn at once with some super scourge Arthas has been saving. (Arthas is a master tactician imo...beat Illidan when they both were on the same level). Arthas monologs about how we are all doomed and that no Dragon power, Holy Light not even the mighty Tirion can save you. A seemingly overwhelmed Tirion makes the righteous statement like &quot;Tirion is no more.....there is only THE ASHBRINGER!&quot; At this point you see for the first and only time Tirion use the signiture pally move ............WINGS! Tirion cuts thru all remaining scourge except those fighting NPC's <br />
<br />
Phase 3: Arthas and Tirion engage in singles combat(somewhat). Both at full power Arthas is still edging us all out summoning random uber elites that must be tanked or they'll also attack Tirion. DPS RACE! Adds must be tanked while we help Tirion kill Arthas. Arthas will every ?secs target a player and yes ..I'm so sorry but 1 shot you, taking your soul. Making him more powerfull and summoning another add. I failed to mention that all players while Tirion is in exalted mode ASHBRINGER! will have a buff increasing all players armor to the cap(maybe w/ an additional bloodlust effect). Yes everyone can tank at this moment. The spawned adds will do enough damged to everyone tanking one that if not healed they will die .....again feeding Arthas and spawning another add. Aggro is perm unless you die. However Tirion in singles combat will be effected by debuff making him take dangerously high +damage from spawned adds only. At this point with proper dps Arthas will fall.........BUT not from you players nor from Tirion. As Tirion begans to strike the fatal blow, he's halted by Bolvar. Bolvar says something like no my brother(not brother brother but brother in battle) He (the lich king) can only be destroyed by that which has made him......and only by He that will take his place. Picking up Frostmourne he turns to the defeated Arthas....(ally King Varian present and contesting&quot;Bolvar NO...WAIT!) Plunges Frostmourne into Arthas killing him. Arthas's corpse fully collapsed and his helmet rolls off ....Bolvar picks it up and puts it on.....beginning to breath the cold breath....eyes glowing...they flash....signaling to the Scourge Force to fall back. continuing his monolog says &quot;There must always be a Lich King.&quot; He then turns from his commrades and walks off to the Frozen Throne.....sits and freezes.....or maybe not.....dunno.<br />
<br />
I posted this on World of Warcraft Head but was down graded and greyed into oblivion. Maybe a possability that Tirion tries to fight Arthas earlier in the fight but is struck down to near death and then saved by the lesser Mograine who then is the one making the statement....&quot;there is only the Ashbringer!!&quot; Cleansed and instantly Winged but still not able to solo Arthas....incoming Phase 3:</div></div><hr />

Arthas monologs about how we are all doomed and that no Dragon power, Holy Light not even the mighty Tirion can save you. A seemingly overwhelmed Tirion makes the righteous statement like &quot;Tirion is no more.....there is only THE ASHBRINGER!&quot; At this point you see for the first and only time Tirion use the signiture pally move ............WINGS! Tirion cuts thru all remaining scourge except those fighting NPC's <br />
<br />
Phase 3: Arthas and Tirion engage in singles combat(somewhat). Both at full power Arthas is still edging us all out summoning random uber elites that must be tanked or they'll also attack Tirion. DPS RACE! Adds must be tanked while we help Tirion kill Arthas. Arthas will every ?secs target a player and yes ..I'm so sorry but 1 shot you, taking your soul. Making him more powerfull and summoning another add. I failed to mention that all players while Tirion is in exalted mode ASHBRINGER! will have a buff increasing all players armor to the cap(maybe w/ an additional bloodlust effect). Yes everyone can tank at this moment. The spawned adds will do enough damged to everyone tanking one that if not healed they will die .....again feeding Arthas and spawning another add. Aggro is perm unless you die. However Tirion in singles combat will be effected by debuff making him take dangerously high +damage from spawned adds only. At this point with proper dps Arthas will fall.........BUT not from you players nor from Tirion. As Tirion begans to strike the fatal blow, he's halted by Bolvar. Bolvar says something like no my brother(not brother brother but brother in battle) He (the lich king) can only be destroyed by that which has made him......and only by He that will take his place. Picking up Frostmourne he turns to the defeated Arthas....(ally King Varian present and contesting&quot;Bolvar NO...WAIT!) Plunges Frostmourne into Arthas killing him. Arthas's corpse fully collapsed and his helmet rolls off ....Bolvar picks it up and puts it on.....beginning to breath the cold breath....eyes glowing...they flash....signaling to the Scourge Force to fall back. continuing his monolog says &quot;There must always be a Lich King.&quot; He then turns from his commrades and walks off to the Frozen Throne.....sits and freezes.....or maybe not.....dunno.<br />
<br />
I posted this on World of Warcraft Head but was down graded and greyed into oblivion. Maybe a possability that Tirion tries to fight Arthas earlier in the fight but is struck down to near death and then saved by the lesser Mograine who then is the one making the statement....&quot;there is only the Ashbringer!!&quot; Cleansed and instantly Winged but still not able to solo Arthas....incoming Phase 3:<br />
<br />
<br />
hm yea.........seem kind of possible :) I wonder if it is like this that blizzard will change it now ;D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exclusive</div><div class="date">2010-01-21, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's quite obvious that some important NPC's will assist us in the fight with LK, just like Maiev on Illidan.<br />
<br />
But you're talking all about summons and adds and blabla... While it sure makes sense, I mean, Arthas kinda ressurected entire northrend to fight for him and he's all about raising dead as scourge... Have you take a look at the room we're supposed to fight LK in?<br />
It's so small! To me it looks like the same size of Rotface/Festergut, maybe a tad larger.<br />
Well I'm sorry but I would never ever want to fight hordes of scourge in that room.. that would be a complete chaos, you wouldn't be able to see anything. If it happends like you say, we'll need a room of at least Marrowgare size or just Illidan's big platform in BT.<br />
<br />
It's also possible that, for example, we start to fight single LK in the small room, at the throne. Then, Tirion (or some other uber NPC but I'd say Tirion) does some uber spell and just destroys the entire spiral, we all fall down to a larger room, maybe saved by some Jaina mass slow fall spell. And then in that larger area we can encounter all the summoned scourge..<br />
<br />
Just a thought :)<br />
<br />
and for your post, I'm not surprised that it got greyed into oblivion, it's a serious hell to read through it.. <br />
<br />
edit:<br />
Oh and I'm not so very sure that the dragonflights will help us in that fight to be honest. Yes, the reds helped us out at the warthgate scene.. but they got their &quot;hands&quot; full of the coming cataclysm and the war with Malygos' blues (yes we killed him but just for the idea) And to be honest, I wouldn't like the dragons helping us out.. I mean, with all the questing and scripted events in instances, we've been so close for example, Tirion, Muradin, Jaina, Wrynn (and horde counter-npc's, Sylvanas/Garrosh) I would seriously be disappointed if they put in dragons and put these key NPC's on a smaller importance.<br />
Anyway, I'm not sure if it was a blue post or scripted ingame text or quest text, but I've read what I said before (the dragonflights being too busy to worry about LK) so besides my personal preference I highly doubt there will be any dragons involved. <br />
Except frostwyrms of course ;)</div></div><hr />
