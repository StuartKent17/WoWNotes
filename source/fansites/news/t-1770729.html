Patch 6.2 - Night Elf Female Running Animation Update<br />
You may remember that Patch 6.1 removed some of the spring in the step of the new Night Elf male character model's run animation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA_Mqxi_uTo). Patch 6.2 does the same thing for the Night Elf female model.<br />

This Month in World of Warcraft History<br />
World of Warcraft turned 10 last November, and we’re well on our way into year eleven! A lot has happened since the game’s launch, and we thought we’d look back on one of the game’s most memorable bits of May-based history with you.<br />
<br />
May 2007—Patch 2.1 introduced The Black Temple, one of the most iconic raids in The Burning Crusade expansion. Players entered the Temple to test out whether Illidan was right when he said they were “NOT PREPARED!”<br />
<br />

Video in the Launcher<br />
The dude was voted the #1 PvP streamer on Twitch as well.<br />
<br />
Yup, he won the recent Blizzard-sponsored voting. It's more of a &quot;community spotlight&quot; type video than an advertisement.<br />
Correct! When and where we can we like spotlighting members of our community who have a positive impact on their peers and create compelling content. Hopefully it's something we can continue to do.<br />
<br />
I don't pay you to<br />
I don't think this is ever the start of a constructive statement in any context.<br />
<br />
<br />
We want to promote members of the community who create compelling content and are positive influences to those around them. That's all. <br />
<br />
We just think some in the community could benefit from being exposed to the creativity of others out there. If we have additional opportunities to inform and entertain the community with content from their peers, we think that's a good thing.<br />
<br />
If this doesn't apply to you or you're not interested in being a part of it, we're certainly not forcing you to click on anything in the launcher -- and never have -- to play the game, other than the button to launch the game of course!<br />
<br />
Videos of WoW players shouldn't be on the bnet app.<br />
That's absolutely a valid opinion with which we happen to disagree.<br />
<br />
If you must put videos on the launcher, then I would rather see you guys highlight the dev team, the art team, the music team, the CM team, the quest team, etc. Those are the true content creators.<br />
That's understandable. And we do that every chance we get, though those teams are obviously filled with very busy people. And some weekends we might like to show what others in the community are doing. This is one of those weekends.

Community Spotlight: Jandice Barov by TamplierPainter<br />
This week’s Community Spotlight is on TamplierPainter, who recently created this excellent piece called “Jandice Barov”. We asked the artist to tell us more about it.<br />
<br />
Q: What was your impetus for the design of this piece?<br />
A: I really like the old instances and raids in WoW. You could say that I'm a big fan of the classics, and that’s one of the reasons that I decided to portray this character. Most players’ attention goes to new content, but I would very much like to draw the attention of players to old dungeons and bosses, some of which have been long forgotten.<br />
<br />
Q: How long does it take you to create something like this?<br />
A: This is affected by many factors, from my workload to the complexity of art. If I’m very lucky, I can finish it in a week. If not, a picture like this can take up to six months. But this one only took about a week. <br />
<br />
Q: What other works inspire you?<br />
A: I love the creativity of Wei Wang. For me, he remains the undisputed authority going back years. He just has amazing technique and command of anatomy, light, and detail. His piece &quot;Darkness Falls, Heroes Rise&quot; took my attention for a very long time. I was also delighted by his &quot;Warchief Garrosh Hellscream”. He is like a teacher to me, and I hope to get to meet him personally someday.<br />
I also really like the work of Andree Wallin and Mariusz Kozik. They are great masters of their craft.<br />
<br />
Q: How did this one tie back to the game?<br />
A: Most of all I love the Warcraft story and the world itself. I love the characters and heroes. I remember, as a kid I played Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans, and most days of my life since, I’ve continued to play games from this universe. Playing WoW, I usually spend most of my time in PvP. I would like to fully complete the PvE content, but that wouldn’t work with the amount of time I have to spend on my art.<br />
<br />
Q: If you could add one thing to the game, artistically, what would it be? <br />
A: I don’t really know. In artistic terms, the game is so harmonious and efficient that I may not have anything to add. Okay – I wouldn’t mind updating the old battleground loading screens! I like how the the new battlegrounds (Kotmogu, Mines ) have very nice loading screens by comparison.<br />

I think it's better looking becuase it resembles vanilla run, though I agree thare should be more motion in mid-section.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also wanted to say that troll females got new run animation too! <br />

<br />
My personal list of Fixes i still want to see are:<br />
<br />
- Wrong Lipstick Colors<br />
- Missing Falling Animation<br />
- Bugged Sheathed 1H Animation<br />
- Cheeks and Nose clipping thru Facemask/Helmets<br />
<br />
But i doubt that will ever happen, since they alter stuff that's not even broken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Wrong Lipstick Colors<br />
<br />
<br />
My biggest gripe.<br />
<br />
My nelf went from neutral colored lips to green ones. I really don't understand how that went through.</div></div><hr />

Nah it proves that they are making money off of it, also it's forced on you as they normally don't dress like that as the twitch people were obviously painted with make-up with the funds from Blizzard department to look well-endowed and much more better than they normally look. <br />

I don't like e-celebs but it shouldn't be the main focus of WOW either it proves Wow doesn't have any worthwhile content and they have no focus whatsoever, I don't mind if it's like off the screen of the bnet app on a little square (similar to Xbox Live) but not on the massive big one, that should be focus of new content and new information upcoming on WOW.</div></div><hr />
