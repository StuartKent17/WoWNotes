While many of our attunements in the Burning Crusade have been good progression checks, a few of the attunements have turned out to cause unnecessary stress on guilds either doing the content or attempting to do the content. With Black Temple and Battle for Mount Hyjal thriving, we want to encourage (rather than prevent) new guilds and raid groups to attempt Serpentshrine and TK. We are going to leave the current attunement quests in the game so that players can still engage in the challenge and the lore of those quests should they choose to. At a later point, we are considering adding a final reward step to those quests as well (that way those who have already completed them would not miss out on a *new* reward).<br />
<br />
We’re listening to feedback from you guys constantly and your opinions are important to us. We want this game to be the best possible MMO experience for our players.<br />

Enjoy Serpentshrine and Tempest Keep =)<br />

Probably a result of S2 gear not matching up with the average guild's raiding progress. Ah well. Can't say it makes a real difference.

Since they are own their own and no &quot;attunment&quot; is linked to them anymore, maybe Blizzard can take heroics in another direction in terms of difficulty and rewards.<br />
You know, since pretty much every blue item in heroics suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Attunements restrict people based on their guilds progress. At least before TBC you could join a higher raiding guild and worry only about a simple quest to get attuned to an instance, now however you are held back by your own guilds progress.<br />
<br />
Overall though this is good news for guilds like mine where we have serious hardcore players and also complete and utter 1 day a week slackers (we are desperate for healers). Now we can go into TK and get void reaver loot.</div></div><hr />

If you guys really want to fix something how about you make it so a 3.5 sec cast aim shot hits for more than 1k, when my arcane and multishots which are instant and .5 sec cast hit for over 2-3k. Its not a gear factor either im wearing 4/5 tier 4. Especially when a 3 sec fireball cast on a well geared mage is guarenteed to hit for 3-5k.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaPoets</div><div class="date">2007-06-19, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sure that many guilds like mine were feeling the frustration from having guildmates that don't play that often but are dearly needed. This cuts some of the time out so that when they are available, the guild can move ahead as a group, instead of spending weeks and months trying to get some key people attuned for this and that. <br />
<br />
Now if a guild isn't properly geared and runs up into TK / SSC then they will be spanked and come to realize that they need to spend more time doing heroics and Kara. Just because a door is open, doesn't mean at all that guilds will be able to walk on through and clear the place. The guilds that put in the hard work are the ones that are clearing these instances and will consider this a moot point. My guild is small, and this will help cut the needed time to get to do SSC &amp; The Eye, but we won't step foot in there until we feel we are ready as a group.<br />

There have been attunement since onyxia, by removing them from one day to another is just gonna cause more trouble with noob players than it solves. <br />
<br />
Yes attunement is anoying and yes it might be a time sink, but at least it divide people eager to progress from people who just plays for free epics. The last have nothing to do in a raiding guild, they can do pvp in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MC: 1 BRD run (u don't even have to complete it)<br />
BWL: 1 UBRS run<br />
TAQ: No attunement<br />
Naxx: Resources which takes no skill but some grind.<br />
<br />
Heck, you can walk in Gruul's Lair/Magtheridon at lv 65, I don't see nobody complain about that.<br />
<br />
And suddenly hard attunement quest chain = everything wow stand for?<br />
<br />
Game content are made so people can play them (btw just a reminder casuals pay just as much as you hardcores do), not for those of you who lack a reality check to flex your epeen and feel good about yourself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Desespoir</div><div class="date">2007-06-20, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my main concern will be the 5 or 6 corpse runs needed in order to enter SSC with 10 ally guilds in front of it, nice waste of time.<br />
<br />
Moreover, we already faced some problems with SSC because of mob data loading, we may now discover that 20 instances running at the same time will greatly affect the server performance (being on a first generation european server is often a problem :( ).<br />
<br />
Concerning the free access, Blizzard finally realized that Arena2 weapons were totally unbalanced with the pve advancement of most guilds. Of course opening the gate will not mean getting the lovely purplz for all these new guilds, but thanks to this Blizzard cannot be charged with &quot;unbalanced pve/pvp weapon itemization&quot;.<br />
<br />
Best wishes to all fresh guilds going to SSC this week, but if you don't actually have gruul or even magtheridon on farms status, please don't complain on SSC difficulty.</div></div><hr />

nobody cried when naxx was released that the attunement needed was a) grinding 2 days (NO brain at all required) or b) buying chinagold and AHing the stuff (NO brain needed at all). <br />
<br />
Why do you all think that a thousand guilds not capable of clearing SH heroic will beat the shit out of hydross (ok, perhaps out of VR...)... <br />
<br />
My guild wanted to start TE coming weekend because we HAD (after weeks of struggling) ~30 ppl attuned to the eye. Again, the nerf wave is faster than we are... But this is nothing to complain about. heroics arent easy and forge players that play their classes better then before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What bothers me is there will be complete yogerts trying the instances then moaning and complaining that &quot;its to hard, theres to much trash, my %^£* isnt big enough, WEAH WEAH WEAH.<br />
<br />
So blizzard may take away the challange at some point, going to be annoying to see EVERY dam hunter waring T5 sholders tho. then again, its not like every guild is going to be able to walk in there and have a fully focused raid group.<br />
<br />
The lag concerns me tho, i dont usually lag, ubnless there is something wrong with the server its self, but others will.</div></div><hr />

You forget the two most ridicilous prequest of the old wow, the one for onyxia + the key for ubrs and a number of other key quest. These were never removed not even after TBC, i hope in someway that blizzard will now when they have given in go back and remove them. Yes i agree the prequest for TK was maybe too troublesome, not because of the difficult, but because of the time it took. But instead of just removing them they could have made it mandatory to kill Magtheridon, and the prequest for SSC was just fine IMO.</div></div><hr />

You are right. He didn't bump it, he necro'd it. Big difference.<br />
