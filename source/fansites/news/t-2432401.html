First thing I noticed too... I'm sure it's effing horde only, continuing on from when Bwonsamdi finds out Vol'jin spirit is gone. Which also means Lich King is ruled out as the boss that Bwonsamdi scared of.</div></div><hr />

In Teldrassil's Shadow - Complete the Tyrande's Ascension storyline. Reward: 'Night Warrior' Night Elf Customization<br />
Night elf heritage armor? More customization options? Either way, very interested where it's going. I wonder what kind of ascension it's referring to, though.<br />
<br />
edit: Apparently it's the Night Warrior, one of Elune's aspects (probably of combat).<br />

<br />
I can't see them going the entire &quot;literally referencing all the troll lore every&quot; expansion without bringing Hakkar up at all, but you'd have thought a raid in Zandalar would be where it would happen - after this I don't think we'll be focusing as much on our current continents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Elune is the primary goddess of the night elves. She is associated with the larger of the two moons, the White Lady. While she is a goddess of peace, she is not a pacifist. One of her aspects is the Night Warrior, who takes the valiant among the dead and sets them riding across the sky as stars.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, I get they want world quests to be relevant, but they should make some currency to counter RNG. Something like 15 paragon boxes = 1 new mount, no matter what.<br />

You won't see any class cosmetic stuff this expansion. It's all about Horde/Alliance and individual races.</div></div><hr />

^This. I'm still waiting to get the Stormheim dragon mount from Legion. I've re-earned Exalted with that faction a dozen times over. Any other xpac and those mounts would be purchasable upon hitting exalted the first time, but NRG gods demand their sacrifices! What a fun feature.</div></div><hr />

It kind of makes sense though, all those things for gaining rep, like missions and world quests, without paragon rep those suddenly become 100% useless, and Blizz wants to keep that stuff relevant for the entire expansion, so a-grinding we will go.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I got last mount literally final day of 7.3.5. And only because I had 12 classes doing mission table for rep once a day - after few months all get exalted and I could send BoA tokens to my main. This time we don't even have this - rep is auto gained.</div></div><hr />

The ultimate defeat against Paragon mounts.<br />
<br />
Honestly I like Paragon system as a whole since it gives me a goal to focus on sans raiding days. But I do feel like they should improve it. One thing is make mounts, toys, etc a universal pool for each paragon chest. Eliminates the feeling of frustration when down to the last reps and they just won't be the featured emissary.</div></div><hr />

In order to get ID you have to grind the rep in 7th legion then go through a scenario and then do MOTHERLOAD, thats just <br />
for the privilege of having the race, then on top of that, level from 20-120 and then on top of that got to do<br />
Ulduar.<br />

<br />
I don't really think it's about hating them. It's just another reason to keep you subbed to the game in hopes of getting a mount. For instance, in Legion it took me until the end of the expansion to get a mount gated behind rep. Which I personally think should have been purchasable once you hit exalted. Mounts have always been this way for EVERY expansion. If they added some sort of bad luck protection to getting mounts from these, i'd be okay with it. I just can't be arsed to do Nightfallen WQs to get the last rep mount from legion. It was a dumb change to the game and i'm glad that we were able to buy them in BfA. I did the Legion dailies everyday as well, I spent hours farming rep, only to be disappointed with every single cache. Opinions will be different from everyone, but I feel like the paragon system was just bad the way they had it.</div></div><hr />

In order to get ID you have to grind the rep in 7th legion then go through a scenario and then do MOTHERLOAD, thats just <br />

Ulduar.<br />

Never have any race required so much dungeons and rep etc in order to get to have them.<br />

Are you sure it's the one for Dark Iron Dwarves? Seems to me it's referring to regular Dwarves, same way Night Elves and Blood Elves seem to get herritage armor in the new scenarios.</div></div><hr />

It seems to be some sort of customization option as result of the Tyrande scenario.<br />

<br />
The model is literally called Tyrande. It's her new model, there's no questions about it. The eyes aren't unfinished either, that's just the result of the Night Warrior ascension, it may or may not be missing a glow effect but even if she is, the glow likely won't be silver but also black or another dark colour. No idea where the &quot;Night Elves have no eyes in model viewer&quot; thing comes from, they all have normal eyes under the glow, the only thing that doesn't get loaded is the glow itself which is only the case sometimes. Tyrande had normal eyes under the glow with the old model aswell, now her normal eyes are just really dark blue, almost black.<br />

You're confusing Dark Iron Dwarf with Dwarf. Ulduar scenario is the Dwarf Heritage Armor, Motherlode/7th Legion is Dark Iron Heritage Armor.</div></div><hr />

Night Elves aren't getting Heritage armor in 8.1. They get new customization options and the Darkshore Warfront armor has the Nelf/Forsaken theme, but the only 2 races getting heritage armor in 8.1 are Blood Elves and Dwarves as Ion announced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They seem to be going large and fast in development so we'll just have to see. I think they just updated some effects on him as a start before giving him the hd-makeover. I wouldn't hold them to it depending on how much they intend to use him. The old model was never bad, just a bit crude and nonetheless it'll still be authentic with the nicer effects. Among the nice new models you can really tell how much the game has evolved looking at him. The contrast is staggering but you don't really notice unless you zoom or focus on the detail in-game.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't sound like he's a big fan of her in the latest transcripts, though. He could be lying, sure, but as questing through Nazmir has shown Bwonsamdi isn't too keen on sharing the souls of the dead with others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that bad luck protection would be a nice improvement. However...<br />
<br />
Do you honestly think someone would stay subbed just to get some mounts? If nothing else is keeping them in the game, why grind out some mounts to just unsub after you get them? And if the lure of a few mounts is enough to flip you from unsubbing to staying subbed... well there are other things you may want to reflect upon about yourself rather than complain that adding a few mounts is a lure.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, the solution here is super easy, just don't chase paragon rewards, or stop chasing them once it gets annoying to you. Just because it's in the game doesn't mean you have to do it.<br />
<br />
And yes, others have literally expressed hatred of the paragon system.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, what about the REAL expansion? Will they release it or have they decided to make the actual joke one continue? The words massive failure are coming very fast, exactly as i said the very day they announced that scam expansion.<br />
<br />
Sorry you don't like the expansion. Much less sorry that you can't manage to communicate that without acting like your opinion is objective reality.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you, if you don't enjoy it, don't do it. Mounts are not the reason I play, they are just there as a nice addition, However, they have always been obtainable after a certain amount of time. Let's take TBC for example, (I did the farming post TBC) I was able to put in work to hit exalted with them to get the mounts. I didn't have to deal with any RNG bs to get those mounts. With Legion it took months to get a mount that should have been purchasable at exalted. That's my 2 cents on the subject. No matter how much time you put in with the paragon system, you can still be out of luck for months. Again, mounts are not the reason I play the game, I still enjoy raiding and all that jazz. I just don't like all the slot machines blizz is adding to the game, and I know i'm definitely not the only one who feels this way. I just prefer things that I can grind out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the storytelling who make absolutly no sense at all, who is not believable at all, even by Wow's standards.<br />
The allied races who have nothing to do in the game and are a big mistake, and the biggest proof that Wow devs are throwing their shit everywhere. <br />
<br />
The Void Elves and the Nightborne more precisely: the first have no sense and are a pseudo race directly pulled from the ass with no coherence. The second joining the Horde makes no sense, objectively they would have be better in the Alliance, but for real, they should never have been playable in the first place: they have been saved by both factions, and are healing from the Legion invasion and are in dire need to rebuild their civilization; they can't seriously take part in a war who is not and has never been theirs.<br />
<br />
Jaina is still alive and kicking in Kul'Tiras, while she is actualy and objectively a traitor and a regicide, she should have been executed on spot the moment she set foot in Kul'Tiras. Even without that, she abandonned the world when the Legion invaded it, and when she was needed the most, but she is still accepted back by the Alliance?<br />
<br />
A bunch of new characters who have no charisma and no use as been added to the game, but i'll let that slip: it is an habit from Blizzard, so ok.<br />
<br />
Yrel and the AU draenei are writen as light fanatics who chase and murder the orcs in the AU: that's bullshit and ridiculous beyond redemption, and this again show that Blizzard is not even knowing how to write their own races coherently, especially the draenei, but after Wod and them destroying the draenei lore with those insults who are maraad and the sargerai, i should not be surprised.<br />
<br />
We already know for sure and without a single doubt possible that the war will end with a sudden peace between the factions, and that EVERY single thing committed by the Horde (and the Horde ONLY, because the Horde is the only one to commit crimes, trying to pass the Alliance as morally at the same level as the Horde is utterly ridiculous and a flat out lie) will be forgiven, and will not have any consequence for the future of the game, EXACTLY the same thing who happened at the end of Mop after Garrosh's defeat; oh yes, because BFA is a remake of MOP, it was evident from the very first day when they announced that joke expansion, because yes, BFA is a joke, there isn't other words to describe that crap.<br />
So, the Horde will have committed crimes beyond redemption against the Alliance TWO times, everytime betraying the peace, everytime attacking first (and don't try to use that fake argument about Genn attacking in Torheim, as he is not the Alliance and he acted all by himself, going as far as faking orders from Anduin, and i said from the beginning he and Rogers should have been executed for high treason); but...Somehow, those litteral monsters will be let in peace instead of being exterminated by the Alliance because that's the only reasonable thing to do to beings who are constantly betraying and trying to kill you, and have proven multiple times they were not &quot;morally grey&quot;, but utterly and for ever purely evil (notably the Orcs and the Forsaken).<br />
So, how many times will we have that bullshit story whose end will bring no consequence at all? Two? Three? Ten? Because you know it like me: there won't be any consequence, because the only true consequence possible is the complete and definitive annihilation of the Horde, which mean it's removal from the game, and of course, Blizzard won't do that because it would sign the end of the game; and yes: the Alliance will win, it is not doubtfull at all, military and power wise, the Alliance is akin to the USA while the Horde is akin to Germany; and even lorewise: the bad guy (in that case Sylvanas) must die for the story to end, especially in a setting were your business model is to provide regular sequels.<br />
<br />
Lore aside, i can also tell you about the class balance who is horrible, the design who is clunky and stupid, the multiple bugs everywhere, including some who were reported since the alpha; Legion also had multiple bugs who were not corrected, i especially remember the class hall bug, who was present since the alpha, and was not corrected until a hotfix during the 7.2, right after that bug gone mad and triggered almost constantly; to be honest, the bugs are not linked to BFA, but more to the pathetic and utter ineptitude of the devs since Wod: the quality of the game and the bug fixes has dramaticaly decreased since then.<br />
<br />
The content poorly and badly designed: island expeditions, who are already abandonned, because they are bland, uninteresting, do not reward anything valuable.<br />
The world quests who are obnoxious and too repetitive, even more than Legion, most of them being completely stupid and seem designed only to make people loose time.<br />
The warfronts are crap and their way of functionning leads to a faction imbalance and an unfair treatment for the players.<br />
<br />
The mythic + who is still present in the game, while it is one of the worst features ever implemented, under the false pretense is is the only way to make dungeons relevant for all the expansion, while in the precedent Xpac, Mop for example, they had already designed the perfect system: the valor points. That concept should have been kept and expanded: use valor points to upgrade your stuff, use valor points to reforge your stuff, use valor points to add a gem slot to your stuff, use valor points to buy a weekly buff, etc etc; instead we have diablo 3 system which is ridiculous and is even more retarded than Legion: bugs, bad tuning, the affixes are poorly designed and create only frustration.<br />
<br />
They kept the warforged and titanforged crap, which is the very thing who is destroying the interest to do mythic raids.<br />
<br />
They removed set tiers, which was a dick move and completely injustified.<br />
<br />
The azerite armors are a poorly system made to replace the tier sets and Legion legendaries, but are unrewarding, bland, and are clearly the work of some lazy designed with no imagination.<br />
<br />
<br />
No yeah, but no, i'm sorry, BFA is by far the worst expansion ever, even beating Wod by a fair margin, in fact, from the very moment BFA was announced, i predicted it would flop and that it would be the worst expansion ever, and seing what happening right now as the expansion is only 6 weeks lengh, i was completely right, and the expansion will end in a massive failure, in fact, it is already a massive failure and a big mistake from Blizzard who thought people had forgotten Wod and that they could do it again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not being delusional =/= blind support. I've been plenty critical of Blizzard, especially as of late.<br />
I simply oppose the hyperbole, the sheer stupidity, of the crowd pretending that Blizzard's &quot;giving the middle finger&quot; or that they somehow have authority on what constitutes an actual expansion. <br />
<br />
What you mean by &quot;WoD didn't serve you well apparently&quot;, I'm not even going to ask, can't expect someone such as yourself to contribute a coherent argument free from an inflated sense of self-importance. <br />
<br />
At least one can quickly dismiss the people trying to argue that BfA is &quot;literally worse than WoD&quot;, so thanks for that. Makes things easier on these forums when people put their intellectually dishonest nonsense on display.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the people not from WC3 here's a quick reminder of that that tree is about :<br />
<br />
&quot;The Tree of Life is a mighty enchanted sapling of the World Tree, Nordrassil, from which the night elves draw their life energies. This mysterious ancient is the key to the night elves' immortality and harmonious coexistence with nature. Nordrassil's energy, channeled through the tree of life, allows the night elves to benefit from its powers regardless of the vast distances that might separate them.&quot;<br />
<br />
That thing is really, REALLY interesting lorewise. For the longest time Blizz told us that the NE sacrificed their immortality when they blew up the tree at the end of WC3, but as we know in wow, the tree is perfectly fine, so there's no reason for the NE to have lost that immortality, and now that the Tree of Life is FINALLY present in wow, that seem to confirm that point. The Night Elves are once again immortals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is literally so much of truth :D I had hopes for BfA, but it was actually the first Blizzcon that didn't hype me so much when they announced this xpac.<br />
The thing I always repeat, is that their storytelling owadays really troubles me - it's some kind of poor copy of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;? That backstage plotting and the endless statements of devs like &quot;You will see the true intentions of characters later...&quot; brings me to tears. I want it now, not tomorrow. I want to know the threat - otherwise the fight feels pointless and not really much of a fun at all. The whole concept of war is basically wrong. I have a feeling they tried to make it more believable and human with things like scorched-earth policy with Undercity. But it feels so wrong :(<br />
<br />
All those systems aren't interweaved well. Instead, one comes from another - and for example the whole system of Azerite feels mandatory, thus all that is conntected to this systems oblige me to repeat it (like Island Expeditions).<br />
<br />
And the worst thing of all. WoW lost the deifference between casual and hardcore - the line is so blurred nowadays. People have no time or willigness to be better and stronger? That's why they get the gear from warfront, mythic+ and all the other stuff. Like Uncle said: mythic raids feels pointless beside the wowprogress and achievements. I remmeber the days, when the good loot came from the raids. Now I can much better loot from some super-uber titanforge and with that stupid system people easily sold the joy of hard progression for some brief moment of happiness when they drop 395 gear from world quests or warfronts. It's simply wrong.<br />
<br />
And that's why I agree with Uncle. And basically it's an objective truth. The game's difficulty drops so hard, it became very casual and lost the sense of being rewarded for being skilled. Even heritage armor is just a matter of a questline. Why didn't they spent those graphic desing resources to make a gear on some challenging stuff like Mage Towers (but this time with fixed ilvl, so it will stay meaningful for the rest of xpac)? It all starts when some universal standards; some basic rules are broken - just like blurring the line between casual and harcore. I have a strong feeling that now the game is all about the time-commitment, not a skill at all. <br />
<br />
And I say it all as a noob and casual with 358 ilvl, with only Atal'Dazar 6+ done...<br />
<br />
When people DEMAND and Blizzard listen to those demands and carry it out, it all collapses. Blizzard needs to understand that not everything what people demand is healthy for their game. But on the other hand I think it might be hard for the to understand as long as they have many delusional supporters of EVERYTHING, and they lost the passion and turned it mainly for a profit :( - proof? The best mounts comes from shop? Those with unique models, not the recolors. All you get from game are 10 recolors of the same horse :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I believe that Blizzard did really good job with zones aesthetics and music - and that would be all. 6 weeks and the game is dying :(</div></div><hr />

It wasn't (http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/06/11/02tyrandewhisperwindjpg-98f713_765w.jpg) very good, but now it's just &quot;new elf female model&quot;-degree awful. Yikes.<br />
<br />
--- Edit ---<br />
Also sabers looks dirty because of wool art, which isn't smoothly merge with each other forming a neatly homogeneous beautiful coating, but covered in pieces/clods of thick lines drawing. Friend was right (https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17620542280?page=2#post-25), they'll never learn how to draw proper hair/fur/wool. If they really wanted to depict something, they could use barely perceptible (https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GELB2Wq4oC0/maxresdefault.jpg) thin lines (https://i1077.photobucket.com/albums/w470/Kiana_Lacy/explanation.png), but these are just agglutinated fur (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2446176-Goblin-and-worgen-models?p=50418674&amp;viewfull=1#post50418674) pieces (by the way stag is more or less decent in this sense, but &quot;GorillaBoss&quot; isn't :p).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lichbane</div><div class="date">2018-09-23, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, the string of either Baine or someone else saying that sylvanas led us to victory against the legion. She was there for selfish reasons and to enslave the Valkyr, failed, poof she's gone.<br />
<br />
Yeah. That gave me a good chuckle.<br />
<br />
I'm actually surprised there is not more debate about that string of quotes. It's clearly revealed that Voljin did not REALLY give his consent for Sylvanas to be warchief and that he was manipulated. Sylvanas' rule as Warchief is based on a lie.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorejira</div><div class="date">2018-09-24, 04:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As much as I am sad that Kultiras humans druid moonkin isnt a wickerman, I am also happy, cause now I won't care about playing that spec (never been a fan of moonkin and would have been compelled to play moonkin just so I could have wickerman look lol)<br />
<br />
I am starting to feel like Zand druids are getting a lot of favortism though. Yes, Kultiras druids are really awesome (and I do like their feral/guardian forms better than the Zand forms personally), but that aqua travel form. Dammit, I want a shark with tusks :&lt;<br />
<br />
Kultiras druids need some hammerhead boney/wicker creature thing or something to top that. Actually, just let me be a hammerhead or greatwhite and we will be good Blizz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yet, she is not a boss in it.</div></div><hr />
