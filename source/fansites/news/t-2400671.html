<br />
For the first one we're going to try one focused on Mythic+! We want to hear everything you guys have on this feature we introduced in Legion. What you think it does well, what you think it doesn't, ways you'd like to see it go, how did it work throughout the course of the expansion, etc. <br />
<br />
Also a friendly note that just because you see it here doesn't mean it will be changed or added - and this topic is not an indication of future feature development.</div></div><hr />

Increase required % or make some trash unskippable (by increasing density or fix pathway bugs like in Everbloom, Triumvirate, Azshara), that's ridiculous that there are dungeons where people are trying to avoid packs with a 50% chance of failure in PUGs.<br />
That's boring as fuck, but everyone seems to think it is mandatory. Hell, I'm even asked to use an invisibility pot to avoid the first packs in BRH in sub-10 keys. People don't even know you can actually kill those mobs anymore.<br />
<br />
- If Mythic+ Dungeons are going to be the reference for PvE content, put more solutions to repair in game (like repair NPC like in Karazhan, or allow mounting areas in all dungeons). Wiping a lot of times can happen especially in PUGs, but usually if that happens in DHT or Arcway, your group will disband as soon as someone has to repair, unless you have an engineer or a warlock.<br />
<br />
- The fact that Mythic Plus are only based on timers... Yuck. If your class is not top-tier DPS, you'll be benched (unless you are 20 ilvl higher than anyone else). Change that. Make controls mandatory. Make survivability mandatory. Make something else mandatory.<br />
Give other criteria for Mythic+ success. Full run without death. Full run with less than X amount of damage taken. Full run without taking damage from X ability (like Ready for Raiding achievements).</div></div><hr />

I second that.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that I did gold challenge runs in Pandaria and high Mithic+ in Legion, I never really enjoyed the speed runs and did it only for the achievements and rewards. Would like to see it changed into something that is not always go, go, go.</div></div><hr />

But then they &quot;ruined it&quot; by removing the depleted key mechanic.<br />
<br />
Instead, you get a lower key to a random (yeah, what else) dungeon. This makes it incredibly hard to practice specific dungeons/affix combos at higher keys within the timelimit of the weekly reset, you have to grind lower dungeons like mad and hope the lottery gives you the same key again (which it probably won't), and then deliberately fail higher keys that are not for the dungeon that you wanted to practice. It feels bad man.<br />
<br />
This made M+ yet another &quot;let's see how long we can keep them logged in for MAU reports&quot;-feature. And Legion had so many of these, I just felt like I was a row in their quarterly excel sheet, instead of playing a great MMO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omedon</div><div class="date">2018-05-30, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think M+’s very existence tainted the approachability of dungeons on all difficulties... but... I appreciate that they were implemented and developed at the same time as other options in on-demand PVE to take their place for those that will never be interested in the culture grown by the presence of “dungeon NASCAR” that is the MDI.<br />
<br />
If we didn’t have world quests, and weren’t getting islands and warfronts, I’d personally be further annoyed by what such high ambition and pressure in the 5-man PVE sphere has done to specifically the PUG space. Tanking and healing is positioned to become as unapproachable as it’s been in a long time... but there are role-agnostic options present and incoming, so that’s all much less offensive.<br />
<br />
All I’d ask in conclusion is that if dungeons in general are all seemingly meant to lead to “M+ ambitions,” that they continue to be taken out of the “mandatory” main thoroughfare of story delivery. Indeed a singular, impersonal LFR run as a mandatory story step is more attractive than a story-mandatory 5-man in the current climate. Keep them optional, let us explore all the other avenues that WoW has to offer, and let us continue to safely avoid 5-man content if it’s all just going to be a farm system for an Esport.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MAU stands for Monthly Active Users. It doesn't matter whether you play for 1 minute or for 400 hours. So really I don't see why people insist on perpetuating this myth about Blizzard forcing us to spend longer hours in the game against our will. <br />
<br />
Blizzard want us to stay subscribed as long as possible, which means their interests are best served if they don't burn their players out. <br />
<br />
So, no, the removal depleted keys was not some insidious plot to manipulate us into spending longer hours jumping through unnecessary hoops. It was done because depleted keys felt like a punishment when you failed. <br />
<br />
Also, there is a good reason behind the idea of keys being tied to random dungeons: It's to ensure a bit of variety. Remember in the early days of M+ when you had people running Maw 50 times a week? That's what happens when you give players too many choices: They converge to a single solution. Keeping the keys random ensures that we get a decent variety in our diet of M+ consumption.<br />
<br />
<br />
And Legion had so many of these, I just felt like I was a row in their quarterly excel sheet, instead of playing a great MMO.<br />
<br />
When you go into something with a pre-conceived notion about how it is going to be, it tends to bias how you actually experience it. So if you want to convince yourself that you're &quot;just a row in a spreadsheet&quot;, odds are that's how you're going to feel. <br />

The Main Issue is Class Balancing. You will see always the Same Tanks/Healers in the very High Keys. <br />

<br />
Yeah - there should be a way of getting a challenging 'to finish' M+ key without having to worry about the timer to get there.<br />
<br />
I'd love to try doing a complete on a M+20, but that just isn't going to happen as I have no access to a a M+20 key.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Willeena</div><div class="date">2018-05-30, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly I LOVE mm+, more than Raids, less boring (yeah, even MM Raids are boring , from a tank pov anyway).<br />
<br />
However I hate the &quot;run against the clock let us zerg and cheat as much as possible&quot; idea behind the mm+ idea ...<br />
Under 20+ it is still ok to find intelligent groups, however over that threshold you only get people flamming you if you don't skip a pack, or cheat, or invisi pot, etc etc...<br />
<br />
Should MM+ become the highlights in PvE then Blizzard should take away the timer and add objectives like :<br />
- control x mobs.<br />
- do an overall damage of &quot;xxxx&quot; during the dungeon (critters and boss excluded)<br />
- do not res more than x times<br />
- control x mobs for a overall duration of &quot;x&quot; minutes<br />
- defeat named specific trash semi-boss under &quot;x&quot; minutes. (one timer for one named and not for the entirety of the dungeon)<br />
- etc.<br />
<br />
Thing that require discipline and that is in a way not linked to an iLvl.<br />
<br />
And for the haters, blizz could still maintain a timer race in other events or something like that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cface</div><div class="date">2018-05-30, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's up with the timer panic? It's really nice as it is now, just plow through mobs one pack at a time, and even with a few wipes you can still do it. And so what if it runs out? You still get loot and credits for doing that key towards weekly. <br />
<br />
M+ is brutal for pugs, and a lifesaver for a guy like me that only wants to play with irl friends, and still feel progression. If we struggle on a boss on tyrannical, and a 5th member leaves, we just stay there to get the feel of it. Absolutely the best thing about legion. Only thing I don't like is certain affixes which just seems lazy and not fun.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HuxNeva</div><div class="date">2018-05-30, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">M+ was the star of the expansion. I loved it.<br />
<br />
I understand that the open ended difficulty will eventually always favor some classes over others as you push the limits of what is possible. Still, balance could be improved. I think M+ should be the focus of the class/spec balancing rather than raid dps.<br />
<br />
For squishier classes like Mage, the survivability legendaries (Prydaz/Beovir's) became an important part of the toolkit as keys were pushed higher. How will this be compensated in BfA?<br />
<br />
Swapping out gearsets and Legendaries during runs was a major thing. With the lgendary effects moving to talents for some specs/classes that can not be swapped mid run, how will this be compensated as some classes are fine with AoE/ST in the same config, while others are extremely polarized and need different setups to not be complete wet noodle floggers one way or the other?<br />
<br />
Just get rid of the 'Explosive' affix. All the rest are fine.<br />
<br />
I hope the rewards will be more significant in BfA. The capped base ilvl at 940 and the low TF proc % made running high M+ definitely unrewarding given the investment and difficulty. Lose the 'weekly chest' and up the end of instance loot, either by increasing TF proc % or by relaxing the base ilvl cap (e.g. to what would be 965 equivalent for a +20).<br />
<br />
Reintroduce key depletion, but allow to re-roll a depleted key to a random undepleted key -1 level. Also, allow arbitrary downleveling of a key.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alduin</div><div class="date">2018-05-30, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all: I did play some m+ keys but did not enjoy this content particularly often (2 chars per week +15 for the chest). Even with affixes the dungeons become somewhat repetitive and boring (especially if you focus on loot upgrades).<br />
<br />
What I loved is the possibility to run dungeons even after heroic items to get improvements and the scaling of the items provided. You atleast got some rewards (while running Heroic raids can result in weeks of waiting for your set boni). Also the complementing 2-item boni added some nice flavour. You can easily upgrade a &quot;fresh&quot; (item level 880) character to 920 within a week. As catch up mechanic - good. As min-max mechanic - horrific (the rewards at higher keystones were neglectable to the effort put in so you stop at your weekly +15).<br />
<br />
The biggest issue I had here is the &quot;group requirement&quot; to get into a m+ group (aka you run a dungeon giving you itemlevel 900 and the groups require 930). So often you are running lower keystones (atleast with randoms).<br />
<br />
What I did not like is the &quot;must have 3 chests&quot; mentality of most groups. This is a result of mixing the Challenge mode timers with &quot;more loot the faster you are&quot;. There are multiple ways of how to reduce this (e.g. by guaranteeing every member a certain itemlevel for a certain keystone level achieved and increasing those baseline by 5/10/15 itemlevel for every timer bet).<br />
<br />
Also: Class balance within itself was very struggling during Legion as some classes needed different itemsets and legendaries for SingleTarget/AOE whilst others were good to go by design (comparing moonkin versus demon hunter). Some legendaries however where must have to dish out a certain amount of damage required (e.g. Raddon's Cascading Eyes as Demon Hunter). <br />
<br />
What I am unsure about is the ability of decently gear tanks to run m+ solo (Mionee with +22 CoS is exceptional) due to their selfheal. 1 Tank + 4 DPS was (and still is) a decent strategy for most mythic plus dungeons. This can be fun to watch during MDI and might reduce the need for heal but is that still WoW and not Diablo?<br />
<br />
Some things Blizzard should consider in the future:<br />
a) Some affix combinations where really hard while some where considerable easier.<br />
b) Class balance (e.g. does Blizzard balance classes on M+, raids or PVP) - now that BfA gets some unique class boni back, Blizzard should really take a look at the MDI class distribution regarding overall performance and cheese strategies (e.g. Court of Stars event with Demon Hunter).<br />
c) Loot - in Legion you knew with dungeons you want to run for titanforged item upgrades and which for upgrading your key (I only had to run 3 dungeons for items over and over again). I guess that this will get worse with the Azerite upgrades (as you might only run dungeons for Helm, Shoulder, Chest improvements). This does not mean that Blizzard should redistribute all the loot and increase chances of &quot;unwanted&quot;/&quot;dead&quot; loot in every dungeon but rather define a rewarding systeme e.g. like the Titan Essences or Antorus upgrade stones (e.g. you get an item that upgrades your gear by 5 itemlevel and you only get one from each different m+ )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry to tell you but Blizz changed from reporting active users to reporting &quot;time played&quot; when they noticed the active players are going down. Sure they would prefer to have more paying players but since they can't get those it's fine for them to report &quot;increased time played&quot; to their shareholders. To reach that goal they definitely increased the number of grindy time sinks in the game(guess why you need to play the allied races starting at low levels to get the heritage armor. There is no reason for it aside from time sink). You think Blizz cares if you run something 50 times in a row? Nope not really, they have countless stuff that you got to repeat over and over again. If you need to do 50 runs of something(to get whatever reward) and you do them in 12 hours instead of 30 hours, that's what matters to them. I quit due to the ever increasing number of time sinks a couple of months ago and I don't see myself comming back(except maybe to turn my millions of gold into blizz-cash).<br />
<br />
As a shadow I can say that M+ never really matteder to me. Guess why...<br />
On top of that there was more than enough other stuff to repea...ehm...do.</div></div><hr />

I would love it if they changed the system to &quot;Complete the dungeon to get +1 key upgrade&quot; - &quot;Complete the dungeon in time to get a +2 key upgrade&quot; - &quot;Complete it in an even shorter time for the +3 key upgrade&quot;. This way the people who want to go slow and methodical will be able to upgrade their key, but there is still some incentive for people who want to rush and do it fast.<br />

1 Tank 1 DPS, 3 healers? Sure. No point risking deaths when speed doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
But it does still matter. The team with lots of DPS will be able to clear 3 dungeons in the time that the 3 healer group clears one. Let people play healing teams or be super safe with their pulls if they want to. Part of the fun should be coming up with strategies to overcome the challenge with the group you have (or the friends you have) rather than being forced into the solution being max dps for every problem.</div></div><hr />

Had it several times with randoms that one did leave mid instance because he/she thought we wouldn't do it in time and then barely not making it in time with 4 or some idiots making panic pulls because of that stupid timer.<br />
To be honest I'm more one of the people who like to get thru the dungeon with a bit slower more organised pace, that timer is a real stress-er there.<br />
<br />
I would support that. The most fun I had in hard dungeons remains TBC heroics. No time pressure, but good execution of tactics for all kind of mobs / groups, not only boss tactics. When your job as DPS was not only that, but also interrupts, CC, kiting, managing aggro / threat, also group support with things like dispels or off-healing / off-tanking.<br />
<br />
I would like that to come back, not some stupid time runs, where AoE stuns is the only CC that matters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most boss fights are super engaging and actually really fun to repeat. I'm definitely going to remember HoV after legion ends, it has such nice variety. The dragon platform mechanics/lighting on Hymdall really test your spatial awareness almost to an annoying degree, but it's a good one-off and sets the standard of the dungeon straight off the bat. DhT was also really good- i liked that Dresaron encourages stacking for the pushback, and that volcanic/quaking can change that up a bit dpending on the week.<br />
<br />
Personally i think that open spaces in M+ is more fun than confined areas (like in Maw). A closed space can get claustrophobic at times, especially if it's the theme for most of the dungeon. If the space is confined it would be cool to see the environment play a point, like if there was a dungeon that at one point features a narrow cliffside + mobs that might occasionally punt you back (and if you do happen to get knocked off the cliff, i really want to see you fly, lol.)</div></div><hr />

OT Only did a couple low M+ Liked the diff but hated the watch. I don't mind an execution timer in a couple of dungeons but to have it in all of them I find obnoxious as a player. It gets arbitrary+appears lazy with no NPCs to rescue. Make gauntlets if you want people to have a sense of urgency or require a full clear preventing wall-hugging and short-cutting. Even better - make huge places again so people need to have a move on if they want to finish it any time today. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Kite trash mobs, have to use CC, Tanks that can't tank 15 mobs at once, pulls that you have to pull right or you get too many to deal with, etc. I'm not suggesting that every trash pack or instance has a kite drak as far as you can while you clean out the room but something other than pull a trash pack and just AOE it down is needed.

This will allow groups to make several attempts on dungeons if they want to. At the moment, if you fail your key, there is very little chance that you will get the same key (same lvl) this week. Upgrading the key should give a random key as it is now.<br />
2) One-shot mechanics are okay, they will happen anyway because of unlimited difficulty. But make sure that the most hard hitting abilities give you time to react. (Example: Increase Hyrja's bolt casting time to 2 seconds at least).<br />
3) Class balance... Many say that there is something needs to be done, but I highly doubt that anything will change. Otherwise it will result in having 4 generic classes: melee dd, range dd, tank, healer.<br />
4) Would like to see in-game seasons with leader boards available in-game, world/realm. This should be tied to raid releases. Rewards with unique titles, mounts, or transmogs (anything which doesn't affect gameplay) for ending season in top N%.</div></div><hr />

Increase required % or make some trash unskippable (by increasing density or fix pathway bugs like in Everbloom, Triumvirate, Azshara), that's ridiculous that there are dungeons where people are trying to avoid packs with a 50% chance of failure in PUGs.<br />
That's boring as fuck, but everyone seems to think it is mandatory. Hell, I'm even asked to use an invisibility pot to avoid the first packs in BRH in sub-10 keys. People don't even know you can actually kill those mobs anymore.<br />
<br />
- If Mythic+ Dungeons are going to be the reference for PvE content, put more solutions to repair in game (like repair NPC like in Karazhan, or allow mounting areas in all dungeons). Wiping a lot of times can happen especially in PUGs, but usually if that happens in DHT or Arcway, your group will disband as soon as someone has to repair, unless you have an engineer or a warlock.<br />
<br />
- The fact that Mythic Plus are only based on timers... Yuck. If your class is not top-tier DPS, you'll be benched (unless you are 20 ilvl higher than anyone else). Change that. Make controls mandatory. Make survivability mandatory. Make something else mandatory.<br />
Give other criteria for Mythic+ success. Full run without death. Full run with less than X amount of damage taken. Full run without taking damage from X ability (like Ready for Raiding achievements).<br />

Nobody cares about you doing successfully one run.<br />
There are 5 times fewer Shadows than Warlocks in 20+ (6 in Tyrannical).<br />
<br />
Honestly, we're in 2018, and there are still people arguing they are not racist because they have one black friend. Totally awesome.<br />
<br />
I never said &quot;snail walk&quot; should be the reference. I said it should be one possibility. You, as the elitist jerk you are, could still complete your key zerging everything with your Shadow friend and your 4 985i friends, while people with sub-par/sub-equipped chars and friends could just do a slower run but still with a chance to finish it. I said it is retarded that the ONLY CRITERIA is the speed, today. Of course, the timer should remain, but it should never be the only one. That only encourages retarded flavorless speed runs.<br />

<br />
That only applies if you are playing low keys, once you get into the higher brackets as early as 20+ or so <br />
badly handled trash will melt you and your party. Some mobs require very specific CC, others need to be interrupted<br />
or disrupted because they have protected casts and are immune to stuns. <br />
<br />
Some affixes will force you to use a DPS to kite parts of the trash while the tank holds onto the rest, necrotic has a few<br />
pulls throughout that you will really struggle to complete if you just put it all on the tank. <br />
<br />
There are also several mobs that are too fast to kite and can't be slowed or stunned. <br />
<br />
This is the same problem as LFR has, once it gets easy enough, you don't need to care about mechanics, and 15 is too easy<br />
to have to care about them most of the time.<br />
<br />
And to the people saying you should need to CC (More than you already are) Do you really think that is difficult? Focus a mob,<br />
press your cc focus macro, dps the primary target until your CC is about to run out, repeat. <br />
<br />
The difficulty comes from having to &quot;CC&quot; on the fly, as the pack you just pulled has 3 casters and they won't be dead by <br />
the time your 3 allowed stuns run out.</div></div><hr />

Because you ignore something that is in the game for 14 years? Did you play all the mobs in LBRS in the entrance room? Or in undead strat the mobs at the trap? Did you walk left in Slave pens to skip the naga pack after the second boss? Its nothing new.<br />

<br />
There are over 200 shadows in the 20+ range https://raider.io/mythic-plus/season-7.3.2/world/leaderboards-character/priest/dps/10#content<br />
Wont scroll further. Yes there are more WL. There are also WL with 250+ ranked multiple times. Yes, the leading groups rerolled for a better experience. You can do your runs with low equipped people. You just meet the timer on earlier levels. Adapt or hit the wall. We all did.<br />
<br />
But take your idea here:<br />
<br />
Full run with less than X amount of damage taken. <br />
<br />
<br />
It will get harder on every level, because of the dungeon damage multiplier. So scale it with keystone level? Ok. I want to finish it. Timer is not relevant, but the def CDs are. So why take a shadow? On unavoidable casts he will wreck up the damage taken, while the rogue just faints it and the mage is sitting in his cosy block. What would it change? Instead of looking at the damage done, classes will ranked by personal cool downs and it would just shift the meta to another fotm.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, we're in 2018, and there are still people arguing they are not racist because they have one black friend. Totally awesome.<br />
<br />
Context? But you are right. We are in 2018, where everyone is successful and if they are not, something else is to blame. You are an outstanding shadow and the only thing holding you back is your item level. So blame some elitist jerks!</div></div><hr />

Why so someone can throw 3 hours at it and get the best loot... The timers are generous as fuck and if your not hitting them you just aren't trying. The timers aren't there to increase difficulty put to prevent cheesing and requiring you to actually know the fucking dungeon.<br />

<br />
You get an additional item drop every 5+ after 15. If you can do a 15 in 11 minutes but a 20 in 13 minutes it's worth it but yes the rewards shouldn't stop. Raiding just needs separate and more powerful rewards raid trinkets are a great example.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter whether you play for 1 minute or for 400 hours. So really I don't see why people insist on perpetuating this myth about Blizzard forcing us to spend longer hours in the game against our will. <br />
<br />
Blizzard want us to stay subscribed as long as possible, which means their interests are best served if they don't burn their players out. <br />
<br />
So, no, the removal depleted keys was not some insidious plot to manipulate us into spending longer hours jumping through unnecessary hoops. It was done because depleted keys felt like a punishment when you failed..<br />
<br />
They also measure daily activity, that's just not part of their KPI reporting. They mention it in the Q report though. <br />
They absolutely want to drive in-game engagement and they absolutely have built their features based on this. It's undeniable, even for a seasoned fanboy like myself.<br />
<br />
So if depleted keys felt like punishment, how does entering that new +23 mythic (or any other &quot;at the time challenging&quot;) dungeon feel like when you know you only have *one shot* to get it right, otherwise you'll be spinning the lottery wheel hoping you'll eventually get the same key, so you can try to correct that unfortunate mistake you made? If you don't think that's punishment, then I guess our pain thresholds are just completely different.</div></div><hr />

Though I really think it should change in layouts from Normal, Heroic, and Mythic also. It gets way to boring running the same dungeon over and over. I would even agree with maybe a random layout in mythic +.<br />
Don't change if you fail you get a lower Key. There are some really bad trolls out there. You drop a Key and they leave in the first two pulls. I would even agree to a cool down and not a 30 minute one. I think if you mess someones key up you should get an hour and greater for each time you do it. Everyone does not have 4 other friends to run with all the time. Forces us to have to deal with pugging it.

imo they should have been +/- 30 % easier but reward only hc raid mode loot from weekly chest (so in case of antorus i would cap drops from them at 930 or 935 from +15 and weekly chest should drop 945-950 max) - not mythic one. and then anything above +15 should scale harder and harder .<br />

What's up with the timer panic? It's really nice as it is now, just plow through mobs one pack at a time, and even with a few wipes you can still do it. And so what if it runs out? You still get loot and credits for doing that key towards weekly. <br />
<br />
M+ is brutal for pugs, and a lifesaver for a guy like me that only wants to play with irl friends, and still feel progression. If we struggle on a boss on tyrannical, and a 5th member leaves, we just stay there to get the feel of it. Absolutely the best thing about legion. Only thing I don't like is certain affixes which just seems lazy and not fun.<br />
<br />
its pretty simple - with that retarded timer even a single wipe means there is 90% chance at least 1 person will leave group in pugs. <br />
<br />
timer is main reason so few people did CMs in MoP and WoD. <br />
<br />
if it wasnt for timers mythic + would be much much more popular.</div></div><hr />

I think we did +9. Not really a huge fan of the mythic+ it felt like a horrible rip-off from diablo 3. That system should have stayed there.

First, I think it was too easy a method to get raid level gear. I understand not everyone has time to raid, but M+ was kind of a final nail in the coffin to me for raiding. Second, it got a little boring to me running the same dungeons over and over, especially since I wasn't the biggest fan of legion dungeons to begin with. I think if M+ was a weekly event it could fix both of these problems, but then it may be even more difficult to find a group than it is now. Also, maybe more gauntlet challenges as you work your way up</div></div><hr />

&quot;With Legion coming to a close we thought we might try something a little different and collect some specific feedback on things.&quot;<br />

Oh you don't have a dedicated Mythic+ team outside of the 9 hours a week you've devoted to raid with us? There's the bench...</div></div><hr />

If you can do a 15 in 11 minutes but a 20 in 13 minutes it's worth it but yes the rewards shouldn't stop. Raiding just needs separate and more powerful rewards raid trinkets are a great example.<br />
<br />
Raiding does not need more powerful rewards just because it's raiding. Doing +27 in time is harder than (at least) the first 9 bosses in mythic Antorus. The rewards should match the difficulty.</div></div><hr />

Being an SP main and a lover of M+, I only did the +15 weekly on my SP while I spammed the fuck out of M+ on my warlock. Such a shame, I should not have to rely on cheesy mechanics (leggo bugs n shit) to do good dps as an SP. The ramp time alone is shit enough that makes lower keys pointless and higher keys just not enough oomph. Oh well.</div></div><hr />

When 3 chesting was a must, I would agree, but not now. Wipe at first boss? Sorry, I'm not staying here for an hour. <br />
Why are so many people leaving raids? They leave at the smallest fuckup, and when people see 1 or 2 people leave, the raid is very likely to disband, especially at certain bosses. <br />
I feel the timer is there, simply to put a pace for the encounter, nothing more. The negative aspect of timer is that you don't really have time to talk to teammates after wiping at a boss. Maybe you could have a few timeoutes (could pause your cooldowns as well). <br />
Also without a timer you could just CC everything and take one and one mob, which also isn't fun. <br />
Think the timer is something needed, albeit pauses (that lasts as long as you like) would be welcomed</div></div><hr />

Challenge without time being a factor can be more engaging and fun to play, and just less stress or chances of sloppiness from rushing.</div></div><hr />

My thoughts exactly... While I don't want to take over an hour to do a dungeon that should take 15-20 minutes...I also don't like the rush rush rush go go go....I think they're fun if all you want is a completion. But the gotta go gotta got gotta go part of them makes them kind of suck to me. <br />
<br />
I didn't have much fun in M+ this expansion, that was one reason and the other reason was they felt forced on you if you were a raider....Blizzard stated they were an alternative to raiding...yet guilds forced your hand on it...I understood why...the gear from the Cache was insane...but maybe too good.</div></div><hr />
