Please be aware that with the release of the pre-expansion 5.0.4 patch on Tuesday, August 28, all raid lockouts will be reset. This means that you will not be able to extend a raid lockout beyond the week before the patch release. <br />

PvP Season 11 Ending Soon<br />
Arena and Rated Battleground Season 11 is scheduled to end on Wednesday, August 29. At that point, we will determine who is eligible for the end-of-season rewards, a process that should take approximately one week. It's very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for Arena titles and/or the Cataclysmic Gladiatorâ€™s Twilight Drake to refrain from transferring their characters to another realm or faction until after Season 11 ends. The awarding of Season 11 titles and mounts will occur approximately 1 week after the season ends.<br />
<br />
At the end of the season, Conquest Points will be converted to Honor Points, possibly exceeding the 4,000 point Honor cap. There will be no cap on Honor until Mists of Pandaria is released on September 25. At that time, any Honor accrued above the 4,000-point cap will be converted into gold at a rate of 35 silver per point.<br />
<br />
All Season 11 items will cost Honor Points (equivalent to their previous Conquest Point cost) when the season ends, with the exception of any items with rating requirements attached. These items will no longer be available for purchase.<br />
<br />
The next Arena and Rated Battleground season will begin for level-90 players approximately one week after Mists of Pandaria launches. During the break between seasons, all Rated Battleground and Arena matches will be unavailable. Matchmaking (MMR), Team, and Personal Ratings will all be wiped when Season 12 begins.</div></div><hr />

Well, if it's anything like the other pre-patch events, you'll have to spend a couple of hours on it...and then back to GW2 (instead of completing the event on every alt).</div></div><hr />

You must be a psychic because they haven't actually shown much about the event yet besides the blown up Theramore and a few little things here and there. (Mostly data mined stuff)</div></div><hr />

Just about everyone called this. Blizzard is extremely predictable with patch releases. If they have a big patch coming out and a competitor is releasing around the same day, they'll line up the release dates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like every other company you mean? You might see it as pathetic but in the business world its smart to release two big patches to two of there biggest games on the same day as a competing game.<br />
Why wouldn't they do this? It just makes sense really.</div></div><hr />

Unless your work at Blizzard (the only people who have seen the event) then your statement is invalid.</div></div><hr />

I haven't seen anybody say that Blizzard is a villain or that they are Pathetic. People are just saying how un-surprising it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />

While there's nothing weird about sniping dates, more or less all pre-expansion patches has been live for a month before release.<br />
<br />
If anything, GW2 could've released some other day, why a tuesday? Blizzard has maintenance, so that's one thing.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, this. Blizzard releasing major patches for their two top games on the same day GW2 releases is actually good for the GW2 crowd. (Not that release days for new MMOs are ever 100% smooth anyway, but.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
GW2 could never be a ''WoW killer'' in the first place, because it doesn't require a subscription to play. People could easily play GW2 and WoW together.<br />
<br />
The only games that could be seen as ''WoW competors'' AT BEST are Rift and SW:ToR</div></div><hr />

How is it smart? Describe how it's smart instead of just repeating somethign you've heard from someone else that didn't think twice.<br />
Why would you want your release date to coincide with another big release? Games are delayed because companies don't want to compete for the people who might buy them.</div></div><hr />

Will it &quot;fail&quot; as a &quot;WoW killer&quot;? Yes, but I don't think that's it should be, even though lots of people want it to. Hell, I'll be playing both like I played WoW and GW 1 way back in late classic / early TBC.</div></div><hr />

You realize that they need to release a patch for the expansion anyways? This wasn't just thrown together at the last moment to spit in GW2's face. They don't expect a patch to out do a game, it is fucking stupid to assume otherwise.<br />
<br />
Game's get released on Tuesdays, blizzard always patches on Tuesdays. Would you like them to delay the patch because of a competitors game? No, they will go on doing what they have always done.</div></div><hr />

For the wow haters &amp; Gw2 lovers.. I dont get why you even bother commenting here. They need to release the patch sometime anyway. I bet that the same persons complaining, whining and badmouthing Blizzard in this thread would so so regardless of date or size of this patch. Some people in this thread also seem to believe that this is supposed to be some major content patch. Well, it's not. It's not supposed to. it's a PRE-EVENT for the expansion. <br />

Just relax, play what you want and have fun. Be glad that GW2 soon is out and WoW soon has a new expansion. Tons of fun will be had! :) Leave your hate towards wow or any other game for yourself.</div></div><hr />

Except gear threadmill where you grind your ass off just to get gear which will be replaced in half year by antoher gear threadmill repelled me from WoW already few years before. I mostly came back and still played it due to achievements which you dont disenchant or vendor after few months. I enjoyed that aspect of WoW, not the gear merry-go-around. GW1 also had plenty of this kind of content, GW2 will as well. I am looking forward to that. Pandaria? We will see. I am not saying &quot;no&quot;. Time will tell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who's saying they were all coincidences? I'm talking about THIS specific patch, 5.0.4. I'm pretty confident that the 4.3 release wasn't a coincidence in releasing near Star Wars, for example. There was some patch that released close to Rift's release, which I doubt was a coincidence as well. But THIS patch? A pre-patch for an expansion, which barely has anything that could be called content, a patch that, traditionally, is released roughly a month before the expansion itself, a patch that, following logic, would already have been planned for release quite some time ago?<br />
<br />
Sorry, I'm not buying the &quot;counter&quot; argument this time. I bought it in the past, but for this specific patch? Just no.<br />
<br />
<br />
And why not. &quot;lets rush the patch to not lose more millions of people in our game&quot;.<br />
<br />
The hell if I know. Like I said, for all we know this was already set in stone. Even if it wasn't, why should they be rushing or delaying a patch based on another game, when the patch most likely won't be any competition for such a hyped game as this one is? The real competition would be the expansion itself, not a patch with a short-lived event and the system changes. If the expansion was releasing instead of the patch, or an actual large content patch, I wouldn't even raise an argument about this, as I too would doubt it to be a coincidence. But like I said above, for THIS patch? No.</div></div><hr />

It is possible to shift dates by few weeks even on the last notice. You can even move the war declaration/initiation date in last minute. I see why they could not adjust their patch release timing in the last few weeks.<br />
<br />
I spent over 2000 hours in GW1. Maybe 100 of that was PvP. Try again. The fact that you did not like it does not mean other did not as well.</div></div><hr />

More realistically the launch date of Mists is a specific counter, but they need time for the pre-release patch (and didn't have that time when the GW2 release date was announced, if they wanted to release Mists at the same time). But, one leads to the other.</div></div><hr />

Like I said before, calling this patch competition for a new and hyped game is... the hell if I can come up with a decent comparison, they're just not comparable. It isn't a content patch, period. Even if we assume that the expansion release date was set on purpose so that the pre-patch would coincide with GW2 releasing, which in my eyes, seems extremely tinfoil hat-ish, what does that accomplish? This patch will probably only tickle GW2's release, considering it doesn't take a player's attention for a lot of time.<br />
<br />
But again, I maintain that it's a silly assumption.</div></div><hr />

They can be lucky they don't have an expansion right at the same date, if they were ready they probably would have. Then they would have cried.<br />

What's the reward in wow? Oh..that's right gear! That of which GW2 is loaded with. Just because the route to obtain them is different, don't get mad. True, raids are fun in wow! Until you've cleared them...then it's just a grind to get gear...which is based on luck. So technically you could've been raiding DS this entire time, clearing it every week..and still be waiting to get a lucky drop that just never drops for you, or maybe it did but someone else won it. This scenario can also be described as throwing your time down the toilet, especially if you never get it.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't sound like an attempt to &quot;fight&quot; GW2 to you because you are forgetting that during the original MoP press release, and in subsequent blue posts, they said the pre-patch / launch event would only be live for two weeks prior to the release of MoP.**<br />
<br />
They haven't added any content, beyond what they said they were going to do during the press release, in the pre-patch so the absolute only reason they are releasing the pre-patch on Aug 28th is to do everything they can to undermine the release of GW2. <br />
<br />
Whether you think that is smart business or them being jerks is neither here nor there to me but any suggestion that the release date wasn't changed to &quot;fight&quot; GW2's release is beyond naive.<br />
<br />
(**http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2687-Mists-of-Pandaria-Press-Tour -The Pre Mists of Pandaria Patch will be roughly two weeks before launch and bring simple rewards. It might involve a scenario with Theramore and the Alliance vs Horde theme. Chen Stormstout might also come to the local cities and get players excited about what is coming.)</div></div><hr />

Exactly. GW2 is not really even a direct competitor to WoW since it is not subscription based. People can, and most certainly will, play both. If the actual expansion was releasing on the 28th, then an argument could be made. But it's a month away from the GW2 launch.</div></div><hr />

I agree that the patch timing doesn't mean anything, since there's no new content (yes there's the event). My point is, the expansion release date was likely chosen to compete (as much as possible) with the release of GW2, as they've done with other major releases; the drop date of the pre-release patch is just a side effect.<br />
<br />
Realistically, the release of the patch will have little effect on the release of GW2, it's just not unexpected that it coincides.</div></div><hr />

Just stop the whole 'hurhur Blizz releases stuff to counter games'. I heard the same crap with SWTOR, and guess what? I didn't notice anything after that anymore. <br />
<br />
It happens with every MMO being released together with a major patch, and people still discuss the same thing only with a different patch number and MMO.<br />

Just appreciate (or dont appreciate) the release of the patch and move on.</div></div><hr />

Since I have EA for GW2 - I most definately will be :D!<br />
<br />
I'm really surprised at the 'shock' some are expressing though. The timing is spot on for Blizzard and how they operate, from the length of time for Beta/Ptr, to dropping 'something' on a possible competitors release date. All entertainment forms do this, it's nothing new :D!</div></div><hr />

Because plans can't change. They have NEVER in the past changed their mind about the release or duration of a certain piece of content, nor have they ever backed on their plans to go with something completely different. It just HAS to be because of Guild Wars.<br />
Grasping at straws to fuel the argument, that's what I see.<br />

I don't know, it's hard to tell. I doubt it, honestly, but who knows.<br />
However... it's pretty irrelevant for the most part. GW2 doesn't have a subscription model. Anyone who buys the game can just go and play it when they want. They could play 5.0 for a whole week an then go to GW, they won't be wasting any game time as it's free.</div></div><hr />

All the talent and ability changes, the new pet and mount system, account wide achievements, all non Pandaria changes to Azeroth up to level 85, and the new Rage Fire Dungeon (low level, they have hinted there may be a 85 version for story related so we have something minor to do) Aside from that I am not sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any QoL changes, too. But that about covers it. The pet battle system will also be in place, however, it will be &quot;level 95&quot; inaccessible until MoP launch day (presumably the ability to name companion pets will be there, though).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will play GW2 for a month, then play MoP for a month when it comes out. Where's the supposed competition in that?<br />
Now if MoP itself was being released on Aug. 28th that'd be a different story, but it still wouldn't be a competition. In fact it'd be detrimental to both companies to compete.<br />
<br />
GW1 didn't have an &quot;end-game&quot;, in fact it didn't even have a &quot;middle-game&quot;, but what it has was extremely balanced pvp accessible to all, as well as farming. 99% Of playtime for anyone who's ever played GW1 was spent mindlessly farming for hours, just to get gear that is a vanity/visual upgrade... So in comparison GW2 has A LOT more &quot;end-game&quot; than GW1 xD<br />
<br />
But that is no different than WoW's &quot;end-game&quot;, mindless raiding for gear that is only a relative &quot;upgrade&quot;, as it will never really change the difficulty of what you are doing once you progress with said &quot;upgrade&quot; to the next tier.<br />
<br />
In the end, it all comes down to 3 things that are ACTUALLY important:<br />
- Lore<br />
- Achievements (and Vanity Items)<br />
- PvP</div></div><hr />

Game's get released on Tuesdays, blizzard always patches on Tuesdays. Would you like them to delay the patch because of a competitors game? No, they will go on doing what they have always done.<br />
<br />
You can't say it's a coincedence that two major patches are coming out on the same release date as GW2.<br />
<br />
Blizzard are releasing them on that date to counter the GW2 launch hype. Alot of people might want to play GW2, but those same people might want to check out the Battle for Theramore and all the changes.</div></div><hr />

The subscriber numbers have been dropping which will have a negative impact on investors and share prices. I can imagine them trying to counter this a little bit by trying to soften the blow on high impact moments, like the release of GW2 or like they did with the annual pass (which is why they didnt lose subs in Q2 only Q3 came back to bite them in the ass). They are handling it best they can to manage the damage in order for stock not to drop a huge deal - releasing the patch the 28th means that everyone not playing GW2 but still interested in WoW will want to log on which increases active players for them making it look up a bit again. Also timing MoP a month after GW2 releases allows people to try GW2 and those who inevitably don't like it (because not everyone will) can come back to WoW just in time for MoP. I'm going to play both and hope both are successful, will be an interesting few months either way :)</div></div><hr />

Sure, You're right! Blizzard should cancel MoP just to make sure GW2 is a success. Maybe all the buisness should work together to give GW2 the chance to succeed &quot;Ok guys, no games release during the same week than GW2&quot; <br />

If GW2 is that good, it should succeed no matter what the other companies do. BTW, that kind of &quot;poor attempts&quot; already killed alot of potential wow killers.<br />

5.0.4 is not the launch event and I still expect the launch event to be live for two weeks prior, just as they announced.<br />

Music and games tend to come out on a Monday or Tuesday, due to people generally getting paid at the end of the week (Fridays, usually) ... so people tend to still have money to spend on entertainment.<br />

totally.. because... yeah... I wanna wait 2-3 more months for Mists because Blizzard needs to think about ArenaNet's feelings :(<br />

And it's called running a business, it's not a major patch to compete with Gw2, but it's a pre-patch reminding us what's around the corner.<br />

So most GW2 players will play it from august 25th. then on august 28 they can log on wow for a short time get the event etc be finished and go back to GW2 until MoP. Sounds like a good deal to me.<br />
<br />
I hope GW2 will be a good game, will test it at a friends house to begin with and maybe buy it if i like it. No sub means its perfect to have on the side of MoP and D3. Bored of one game play another. :D<br />

But lets face it the patch wont have any effect on GW2 longevity or release, it might just impact slightly on how much time people who split between gw2/wow such as myself put in to GW2.<br />
<br />
Well I think it'll have an impact on the initial sales of GW2, although maybe small.<br />
People playing WoW who aren't dead set on buying GW2 but are bored now, could buy GW2 to give it a try and end up never coming back to WoW.<br />
The release of patch 5.0.4 can give them something to do so that they don't try GW2 when it's released and just forget about it when MoP launches.<br />
<br />
I think what's important for Blizzard is to occupy the media space so that people aren't aware of GW2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Blizzard is a company. Companies that make as much money as blizzard, exist to make money. It's hardly 'backhanded' or 'evil' - It's a marketing strategy. The majority of their major patches have been very well thought out in terms of dates.<br />
-GW2 is B2P. No subscriptions. WoW is P2P. Subscriptions. Thus - They can co-exist. *SHOCK HORROR*<br />
<br />
I will not play GW2, I personally see no appeal. I've played WoW for over 7 years now and no plans to stop anytime soon. That does not mean i'm going to fanboi up blizzard.<br />
<br />
I'm not biased, I strongly disagree with numerous things blizzard does, and usually pisses me off. I'm not going to justify everything they ever say and do.<br />
<br />
My friends will all be playing GW2. It sounds like they think it's an amazing game from playing the betas. I'm almost certain it will succeed more than SW:ToR. <br />
<br />
TL;DR - Blizzard is a company, companies make money. The games can co-exist.</div></div><hr />

Why wouldn't Blizzard wait about 1-2 weeks so the sparkle of GW2's wearing off for people who don't like the style/archetype changes, yet could possibly grow to like them in the future? They'd come storming back to WoW when 5.0.4 hits.<br />

Having played GW1 (from launch) and GW2 BWEs and stress tests, I'd like to point out: It'd be no more than hours, and likely not even that long.</div></div><hr />

Trying to sabotage GW2 with poor attempts, they're realesing Diablo 3 1.0.4 the last week of August (Around GW2 release date) And realesing WoW MoP pre-patch on the GW2 realese date. And then realesing MoP one month right after GW2 when they are usually realesing their expansions around December. Lmao, pathetic.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, not pathetic. I never realized someone owned a day. Thinking that only one thing can be done per day is totally pathetic. Sabotaging GW2? nah...it'll sink itself...give it time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mm I did also, but I still don't think their current server infrastructure will be sufficient. Of course this is pure speculation but we'll see.<br />
<br />
My point stands though - even hours is long enough for people to get their 'new wow patch fix' out of the way unless they REALLLLLY see something which captures their attention (gets harder and harder for many each expansion).<br />
<br />
You know what would be equal parts hilarious and sad? If GW2's launch was less buggy/broken/problem-ridden than the launch of 5.0.4? Won't happen I'm sure but still, would be amusing.</div></div><hr />

The quote, or the information on this site attached to the press event, rather, said the patch, not the event, would be two weeks prior. Clearly, plans can change. And they did imply that timeframe was an estimate.<br />

<br />
And media coming out on Tuesdays has nothing to do with when people get paid or still have money Sales results are released on Monday, so by releasing on Tuesday new releases will have a full week of sales to count. Also it allows them to order more for the weekend if the early sales are strong.</div></div><hr />

There's no way in heaven or hell there were 2 million people online for those stress tests. They were predominantly during working hours on a weekday, for goodness' sake. And there were problems.

Couldn't agree more. I'll be playing GW2 all day long (made preparations, hah) EXCEPT for AT dailies and reset solo on WoW each day for mounts, then on the 28th I'll be in WoW and GW2 combined depending on what feels more fun at that time. When MoP hits I will have had a month of GW2, and I'll go to MoP ready to explore and have FUN!<br />

Also I find it pathetic how people seem to get a virtual boner from seeing that Blizzard does something on the same day as another gaming company...&quot;Omgosh it means they're afraid of this new game that hasn't even been proven a success yet&quot;...kinda like Starship troopers, &quot;IT'S AFRAID!!&quot;...-_-.
