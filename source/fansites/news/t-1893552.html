<br />
Press Event<br />
There was a press event for the movie that featured Duncan Jones, Chris Metzen, and some of the movie cast.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/G6LsyGsfPQc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The initial version of the movie felt a little bit like &quot;Humans are good, everything else is bad&quot;. Duncan Jones came in and pitched a film that told the story of both sides with the same empathy, care, and time.<br />
Blizzard wanted to share the Warcraft story with people around the world, especially the vast part of the world population that doesn't play games.<br />
Blizzard and Legendary shared a lot of the same values, so it was a great match.<br />
Duncan laid out his vision for the film and it felt like he was pulling the thoughts right out of their heads. He gets the details right and appreciates the nuances. <br />
The movie is a chance to show people who we love what it is that has gripped us so strongly for such a long period of time.<br />
If you don't play Warcraft, you can still appreciate the movie as a fantastical story of right and wrong, as well as choosing the right thing to do. <br />
If they do play Warcraft, there are so many great Easter eggs hidden in the movie for you to find. <br />
This movie really feels like it is for everybody.<br />
Durotan was all motion capture, so it took a strong director to make it work. You really have to become the character and get every detail right, as motion capture will capture every detail. <br />
There was an orc cam to help actors get used to motion capture and create a movement vocabulary for Orcs.<br />
Paula Patton plays Garona. She got the script and loved it because it read like a novel, with great background and history for every character. <br />
Patton was also fascinated by the fact that her character was half human and half Orc, living a life of pain and struggle as a slave to Gul'dan. She had to fight to gain respect in the Orc culture and now feels like a fish out of water in the human world. <br />
Patton found the role challenging and initially scary, but she eventually learned to ride a horse and wield a sword. <br />
Garona is the bridge between two cultures that have never met and are now meeting for the first time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q&amp;A<br />
<br />
The actors got some idea of what things would look like during motion capture but they didn't see a completed and finished Orc until after they had been shooting for several weeks. Seeing how great the Orcs would look was a relief to all of them.<br />
Technology has significantly advanced since Avatar, so the motion capture used in Warcraft was even nicer than Avatar. <br />
Gul'dan has an unusual posture, so the actor had to squat and stay hunched over during filming. <br />
The movie is a retelling of Warcraft 1, which was turned into a novel called The Last Guardian. The novel allowed them to build out the characters and story more, but storytelling of games was still crude in 1994. The mythology grew a little more with the movie, along with some tactical calls to simplify themes and ideas. The movie is the ultimate version of Warcraft 1, streamlining all of the best parts into something better.<br />
The team made some weird decisions with the lore over time, some things Metzen wishes he could take back. Retelling the story was a chance for redemption, making the Warcraft 1 that everyone remembers, but better.<br />
The &quot;For the Horde&quot;, &quot;For the Alliance&quot;, and &quot;For Azeroth&quot; roars from Blizzcon 2014 did get used!<br />

<br />
Movie universe &lt;&gt; game universe. Just like all those hero movies which aren't 1 on 1 copies of the comicbooks. Human/orc in a movie about a war between humans and orcs is obviously much more interesting then half 'race that isn't even in the movie'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's one of those things that we know but the movie world can't (imagine reading Harry Potter 1-7 and the first movie is just about to come out today. Granted Sorcerer's stone came out during the first 4 books.. Y'know what I mean)<br />
<br />
For all intents and purposes, Garona, at the time of Warcraft 1, is considered a Half Human, Half Orc.<br />
<br />
I'm more concerned about some orcs that are supposed to be green skinned are still Mag'har... Then again yeah movie magic.<br />
<br />
As long as they remain as faithful to the lore/story &amp; can still capture that - I say why not.</div></div><hr />

My point exactly. If they come to the Azeroth like, now and have never been in contact with the humans before, how the hell there's a half-orc/half-human in there? Other than that, I couldn't care less for the changes in the movie vs. game world (just like they did with Lotr, Harry Potter, all the Marvel movies etc.) if it servers the movie in some way or the other.</div></div><hr />

What just crossed my mind, they had to be in contact, both Gul'dan and Medivh are in the movie and if their story wasnt retconned theres a possibility that Medivh gave Gul'dan his blood or something and he made a mutant as his slave. That would explain Garona. Kinda.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or what's more likely is they're going to 'forget' about that again because if they didn't they'd have to briefly cover what happened to the dreanei and after that segment no one would be sympathetic to any of the orcs. Honestly it feels like they just want to try and perpetuate the orcs as being some sort of noble race which after 11 years its safe to say they aren't. This was their big chance to finally work dreanei into the lore from the start even in a 5-10minute recap scene of orc history for Warcraft 1 but they seem to have blown that opportunity.</div></div><hr />

With that said, I absolutely loathe the way the orcs look. The eyes are way too small, or their skull too big. This is going to annoy me throughout the film. I'm not gonna watch it on the cinema as the cinema is excruciatingly expensive here.<br />

Meh. This is a huge red flag - Metzen CANNOT write characters unless they're redeemed. It's BORING. I want evil/bad characters who stay true to what they are. It would be like redeeming Saruman or Sauron in LOTR. There's no fucking point - it wouldn't make them more interesting or compelling - in fact, it makes the fight against them that much more compelling and important and dangerous, because they can't be fucking redeemed.</div></div><hr />

You are wrong. Please stop spreading lies.<br />
<br />
Draenei are in the movie, you see gul'dan drain there souls to open the portal.<br />
<br />
Garona also BELIEVED she was half human half orc after she left through the portal, she believes this until she eventually finds out that she is indeed half draenei half orc.<br />

Assuming comics are cannon, she IS half-Draenei.<br />
... However.... <br />
She believes she's half human. Khadgar, et all agreed with this in TLG. At the time of the first war, that's the way the story is told. <br />
<br />
Fans have to be careful not to &quot;meta-game&quot; with what they know currently. Think in terms of what the characters know at the time of the story, with the information they have on hand. Her true lineage, even in cannon, isn't revealed until later. How are non-WC movie fans going to have that &quot;Darth Vader is Luke's Father&quot; moment, if some d-bag tells them all the plot twists before they've even seen A New Hope?<br />
<br />
What I really want to know is how much Draenei / Eradar / Burning Legion stuff are they going to have time to squeeze in. Some amount of it has to exist to make the story run, but... This seems to be spanning at least RotH and TLG, possibly more... Gonna be a long movie no matter how you slice it.<br />

Sorry but that doesn't make any sense. How can she be half-human if the orcs never met the humans before, is the character that dumb she can't figure out that makes no sense? Who told her she's half-human anyway &quot;what the heck is a human&quot;? This is the first time the orcs ever encountered a human and the first time humans ever encountered orcs. I'd rather they just left it mysterious why she didn't look full Orc (maybe show some true female orcs). So stupid.</div></div><hr />

Ye, but her belief is make no sense.I mean, ok, Gul'dan had her magically aged but she &quot;grow up&quot; on draenor where no one knew what a human is.<br />

I know people pointed out that Garona is half-Orc, half-Draenei. According to a lore page I read, Garona believed she was half-human for a long time, so I'm assuming the movie shows her during that time period. <br />

1.) Just because something is not explicitly stated or playable in-game, does not mean it never occurred, we don't have enough informatoin to assume that what we saw in the trailer was actually the humans and Orc's joining forces, it's quite possible that Durotan attempts to ally with the humans, but they are ambushed, and it all leads to Durotan joining the horde anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.) Llane and Garona were close friends, and she was very reluctant and sad when she was all but forced to assassinate him. It's not that much of a stretch to assume there was some chemistry between them.<br />
<br />
<br />
3.) The Lordaeron Alliance, formed after the first war, was formed by the seven Human Kingdoms, as well as the Dwarves from Khaz Modan. Just because we don't see the Dwarves from Khaz Modan present in the trailer, does not mean they didn't take part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.) Rise of the Horde. Lord of the Clans. Never happened. Every book and lore stance has the Frostwolves gone into exile well before they even saw Stormwind. Wowpedia, which they tout as a source for getting things right, even says this!<br />
<br />
2.) Llane and Garona were not &quot;Close.&quot; They were friendly yes, but there was never a time he was gonna rail her. No. Garona goes into this whole thing with Khadgar in the books about how she isn't attractive, how orcs see her humanness and humans see her as an orc. Llane is never shown to do anything but treat her like a person, not a &quot;I must caress your face and tell you we will bang after we win&quot; girl. <br />
NEEDLESS ROMANCE FOR ROMANCE SAKE IS BAD. <br />
<br />
It's the elf and the dwarf all over again! <br />
<br />
3.) They talk about forming the Alliance in the TRAILER. <br />
The movie is about the FIRST WAR. <br />
We see Dalaran! <br />
First war didn't even get past Khaz Modan. Lothar gonna bitch out with Varian before the fighting even starts? <br />
Think we're gonna get a khromie after scene at the end? Deadpool riding her about the timeways so we can see the formation of the alliance after llane gets shived by his &quot;Love&quot;? <br />

Yes she's half Dreanei and half Orc. At the time she DOES think she's half human.<br />
Why it's not that far-fetched:<br />
Gul'dan (or Ner'Zhul, can't remember which one but pretty sure it's the first) found a way to speed up the maturing process of orcs. His first experiments were the sons of Blackhand of which one was a final dungeon boss within Blackrock Spire (the original one)<br />
<br />
edit: Seeing as the first war didn't happen over night but more in the span of months (maybe even years) from the opening of the Dark Portal to the first caravan raids to full blown 'Lok'tar' vs 'For the king' I say it's more than likely. Do note that for the movie's sake (and not to drag it out) it will seem MUCH shorter, such is the case with LOTR where the entire trilogy takes over a year but is crammed in half a day of scenes. Nobody wants to see 2 hours of Lothar Ragnbrock (yeah that's his real name *sage nod*) on his horse travelling from SW to Lakeshire.<br />

Well I also think you have just found the &quot;real&quot; Medivh and not all those &quot;mages&quot; people believe to be Medivh.<br />
<br />
If you compare the guy in the back with the promo poster from Comic-Con, I want to believe that this is him.</div></div><hr />

Why was it floating, it didn't start floating untill WC3 and this movie is based off of WC1 correct?<br />
<br />
Also baby Thrall FTW!<br />
<br />
it started floating during the second invasion which already happened, warcraft 3 is about ARTHAS or frozen throne, if there gonna make a second movie it would most likely about baby green jesus (go'el) rise being captured by blackmoore (named him Thrall&quot;meaning slave&quot;)and escaping meeting garrosh (him explaining where the frostwolve clan) they seperate go'el finds the frostwolve clan in arathi mountains, him rising to warcheif, a stranger visits insults the frostwolves of hiding, gets thrall mad him challenging the visitor its no other then orgim doomhammer himself, doomhammer tells him his legacy of his father duroton, they go and destroy outpost and free more orcs, doomhammer dies. <br />
<br />
Warcraft 3 if it were a movie (not gonna be about the frozen throne) but would most likely be about the freedom of the fel orcs in hellfire penn.</div></div><hr />
