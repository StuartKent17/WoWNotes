Fixed an issue where Archimonde was not spawning on Raid Finder difficulty.<br />
Defeating Archimonde on Raid Finder should no longer prevent players from being eligible to obtain Crystallized Fel if they defeat Archimonde again later that week on Normal, Heroic, or Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />

Hellfire Citadel - Raid Finder Wing 5<br />
The final wing of Raid Finder difficulty Hellfire Citadel opened this week, allowing players to kill Archimonde. <br />

Flying<br />
why are raiders and pvpers left grounded when it comes to Draenor Pathfinder?<br />
Counter-question: If you're only interested in raids, battlegrounds, or arenas, why do you care about flying in the open world? (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/635889253893836800))<br />
If you want to fly, we want you to earn it - just like you earn gear, or titles, or basically everything else in the game. Earning flying - which is world content - through PvP would be just as weird as earning PvP gear through daily quests. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/635896422987010048))<br />
so like when i earned my first 310% speed flying mount through PvP, that was weird?<br />
That was also... what, 3 expansions ago? (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/635896948776538112))<br />
what's your point? flight has never been restricted to a single playstyle in the past, why now?<br />
We want flight to be a reward, not something you spend some gold on once you hit max level. And we want earning that reward to involve doing content that's directly relevant to flight. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/635897481952256000))<br />
are you saying that players should be bored and frustrated to &quot;earn&quot; something we've already enjoyed for 8+ years?<br />
I'm saying if you don't want to put in the minimal effort that's required to earn flying, then you won't get it. That's fine. I haven't done the rep grinds either. If I don't get flying, that's my own fault. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/635898246494183424))<br />
the main thing i'm getting from you guys is that you think flying is only relevant to world PvEers. and that just isn't true.<br />
Not at all. We just want it to be something you earn, and world PvE is the best fit for it. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/635899742132670465))<br />
I mean, could you imagine the uproar if for instance you couldn't ding 110 without winning 10 arena matches?<br />
That's exactly my point though. Earning Draenor flight through PvP makes just as much sense as earning Conquest gear from raids. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/635900043900268544))<br />
you guys put so much work into making Draenor beautiful, and fixing it to be be flyable. Why deny us the opportunity to see it?<br />
We're not denying anyone anything. You're perfectly capable of doing a few daily quests. I get that you don't personally enjoy dailies. Working toward rewards is the core of what makes MMORPGs special, imo. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/635900043900268544))<br />
but shouldn't gameplay be fun as well?<br />
Sure, but different people enjoy different things. There's always going to be rewards you want behind content you don't like. I would love to have the monument with the Cinder Kitten on it in my Garrison, but I don't enjoy Pet Battles, so I don't get it. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/635902286665900032))<br />
those should not be gated behind lengthy, boring grinds which alienate PvPers<br />
I think if you honestly care this much about flying, it's perfectly reasonable for us to ask you to do some basic world content. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/635903909005889537))<br />
&quot;i think if you care this much about the legendary, it's perfectly reasonable for us to ask you to do a few BGs&quot;<br />
Eh, I think asking a raider to do a BG is a much bigger ask than asking a raider to do a few daily quests. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/635904672184700928))<br />
what about asking a PvPer to do dailies? I think you're way underestimating how much I haaaaate them<br />
My dislike for dailies has been very well documented over the years. I've just been poking at them once or twice a week. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/635905464274780160))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
If you struggle to find people to play WoW with, you aren't alone. Ranked solo Q please<br />
I'm curious: what would be the difference between a ranked solo queue and the current unrated queue? Better rewards? 10v10 maps? Just having a visible rating? (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/635882105793150976))<br />
Solo 3s queue would be awesome. Something to do when no one is on. Healer/melee/range team templates<br />
What would be different from 3v3 Skirmishes? (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/635886057981001728))<br />
visible rating, competition, conquest. I queue solo skirms all the time; but I can 2v3 in them.<br />
The challenge is, if rated solo queue exists, what keeps it from just replacing skirms entirely? (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/635904955526737920))<br />
<br />
Developer Communication<br />
What they're doing with the site for Star Citizen (blogs, updates, progress, etc). How feasible would this be for Blizzard to do?<br />
There's a few challenges. Biggest is prob. that those updates still take a LOT of dev time, even when Community writes them. Ultimately we'd rather they spend more of their time making content than they do talking about content they'd like to make. Star Citizen's approach is interesting, but I'd be curious to know how much it hinders development. I also think they do a lot of over-promising, which makes sense for a Kickstarter model, but we're trying very hard to avoid. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/636271069427470336))<br />
Star Citizen also has a different development model due to being tied to the responsibilities of crowdfunding money.<br />
Yeah, exactly. It's worth it for them, as talking about features they'd like to do directly increases their funding. We have a much higher risk of *losing* funding (ie: subs) due to failing to fulfill promises. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/636271701274198016))<br />
<br />
I feel like that balancing question -- how much of my job should be communication? -- gets asked in many industries.<br />
Yep. We obviously have a communications department for that, but still need to work with devs to share info. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/636272009836494848))</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;The game is too easy, everything is just getting handed out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I have to work for something like flying?! I should just be able to buy it!&quot;<br />
<br />
It's an endless loop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
those pvp people complaining about flying requiring pve objectives only are the very essence of the entitled, spoiled brats that blizzard has spent the last few years catering to and destroying the game in the process.<br />
<br />
I'm not subbed atm and if I was I wouldn't personally bother with getting flying in Dreanor as I think its pretty pointless at this stage of the expansion / lack of real world content to do once you get it, but these very same pvpers had to do pve content to get to max level and asking them to do a few more pve quests is not asking very much of them...<br />
<br />
these are the same people that rush to max level and then complain there is nothing to do and that everything should be handed to them on a silver platter</div></div><hr />

I'm a raider - I still did the dailies. It was a minor annoyance, and nothing more. People with this mindset aren't going to relent ever - its not not even worth answering those questions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just as the dev explained, flying is related to exploration, so you must to exploration-related stuff to get it. <br />
<br />
Frankly, the PvPers these days are getting spoiled. &quot;I PvP, I am special. But I also want easy access to everything else in the game, or else this game sucks.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MysticalOS</div><div class="date">2015-08-26, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI, dailies aren't only way to get rep. You can just buy the rep with the tens of thousands of gold from garrisons. Heck I made over 1 million gold from garrisons and bought a crap ton of TCG mounts with it. Using only THREE level 100 characters effectively using treasure hunters. Pretty sure the 30k or it'd cost to buy revered can be managed by a pvper. Or do like me and just afk the medallions yourself. save your gold even.<br />
<br />
pathfinder was so easy I had it done 4 days after 6.2 launched. I didn't even spend gold on it. I just afked the 4 rares while i tabbed out and watched tv on computer. Mod went off,i tab in kill rare and move to next location. Got enough medallions worth of rep from my own drops within 3 days. Unlocked pathfinder via afking. It was SOOO hard to afk and tab out too. I had to like, move my char to a pixel where rare spawned, will my fingers to hit alt tab (which took almost all my energy) then finally had to endure the painful grind of watching tv which was worse than death.<br />
<br />
As for securing draenor part of it. buy the missives, steamroll them all in a single day.<br />
<br />
Zone quests part of it. Surely you did a good chunk of that leveling? Just finish that. Again with higher illvl now you just steamroll it</div></div><hr />

Hahahahahaha<br />
<br />
Anyway, while most of the PVP/flying stuff is nonsense, I do agree with this bit that Lore just doesn't seem to get<br />
<br />
I think if you honestly care this much about flying, it's perfectly reasonable for us to ask you to do some basic world content. (CM_Lore)<br />
&quot;i think if you care this much about the legendary, it's perfectly reasonable for us to ask you to do a few BGs&quot;<br />
Eh, I think asking a raider to do a BG is a much bigger ask than asking a raider to do a few daily quests. (CM_Lore)<br />
They admitted it was 'bad design' to force all kinds of players into battlegrounds during the MoP legendary quest, yet now they think it's great design to force all kinds of players into rep grinds (the worst rep grinds since vanilla too), Apexis dailies and Garrison missions?</div></div><hr />

All I see is &quot;QQ aaaa waaa I'm a big baby and I'm upset because I don't like doing dailies to unlock flying, I'm going to complain and whinge and harass blizz&quot;<br />
<br />
Shit, son. In my day when you played games you got what you were given and just got on with it. You bought games, you played them. If you didn't like them, you didn't play them. You didn't get in contact with the developers and moan at them because you want extra ketchup. <br />

For the record I have no issue doing the dailies or finding the treasures. Heck, I had the achieves months ago. It doesn't matter if you come from a PvP or a PvE background; every player spends some time in the game world. It asks for - what - 50 treasures? Most folks achieved that simply by accident while levelling up, and regarding the reps, well you're practically half way to revered after doing all the tanaan introductions and stuff.</div></div><hr />

yep... wasn't even joking... Every expansion since TBC has had dailies and dungeons (in some form, either specific or championing) for Rep, occasionally other methos too like the Argent Tourney. Except Pandaland but it had tons of (different) dailies to compensate (and I wasn't saying it was the greatest anyway). Now it's all 'kill 500000000 of those for 5 rep.' Good job, go kill another 10'000, almost as bad as vanilla like I said. <br />

I have killed precisely one saberon, but I'm almost halfway to Exalted with Saberstalkers thanks to Rumble In The Jungle and Tooth and Claw. Took like a week at most.<br />
<br />
Unseen Influence? Kill the three Rumble rares for 6/10 of the fel fragments, pick the rest up while you do the other dailies.<br />
<br />
And all of the 'objective' zone dailies... there are multiple ways to build up objective in each zone. Destroy banners/blood orbs/fel orbs/siege engines, burn plans/defiled corpses/shadow council documents, kill bigger mobs, kill rares...<br />
<br />
Kill 500000000 for five rep? What the hell are you talking about?</div></div><hr />

Really, you want to complain that you only do Raids or PvP and somehow you should have a way to activate flying. People do realize that flying in an open world...might be tied to something simple to do that requires you to go into the open world and do skilless activity to get something they want everyone to have? It is a no brainer. Flying isn't a legendary item that directly makes your character more powerful it shouldn't require anything but attendance to get. Baffling he wasted his time carrying that ignorant discussion on. Lore has got to pick better people to respond too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I think the new flying model works well. I don't see the guy's logic in saying things like &quot;I think if you really care about the legendary it's not unreasonable of us to ask you to do a few BGs&quot;. Success in battlegrounds is based around the competency of your own team, and the opposing team. It requires pre-made groups, or sitting in a group finder for who knows how long. World content is something you can just start doing without many barriers at all, is largely something you can do alone, and while it might be boring, is still something that you are always progressing toward each time you work on it. You can't really fail and waste time doing a daily, unless they reset while you're doing them, the way you could lose 10 BGs in a row.<br />
<br />
Plus, as was said many times, flying doesn't work in BGs or raids, it works in the outdoor world, so it makes sense that unlocking it is tied to the outdoor world since that's what it will effect. Makes sense the legendaries are tied to dungeons and raids since that's what those will effect most. Makes sense Legion's PvP talents are unlocked through PvP, since that's what they will effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you already have the reputation, buy the plans for the oil platform. 400 oil a day should be plenty for the relevant missions.<br />
I personally did most of all the requirements for flying on the way to level 100. I was missing 2 bonus objectives and reputation once<br />
the achievement was patched in. I did 3 more days of dailies and got it. The bonus objectives took about 20 minutes and done.<br />
<br />
There is no reasonable explanation for people to complain about the unlocking mechanisms of flying. I think that all complaints are just projected rage for Blizzards latest decisions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before anyone jumps in with the &quot;No one is forcing you,&quot; yes, obviously. Playing the game at all is optional just like anything in life but the point is about the game's design (and direction it's heading in). We've already been flying for 8 years, now Blizzard apparently thinks &quot;If you want to fly, we want you to earn it.&quot; So should we be expecting to have to grind for ground mount access soon too? What about access to dungeons or pet battles, probably need to gate them.<br />
Features shouldn't need to be gated in order to force players to play the damn game, the game should be good enough that players want to play it themself. Shockingly enough, ~12m players thought WotLK was worth playing even without any gating 'forcing' them to experience the content, not so many for WoD.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bakinpacman</div><div class="date">2015-08-26, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion as they seem to realize they have completely destroyed crafting professions this expansion they should involve professions in the generation of legendary quests lines where you have to obtain a certain amount of gathering ingredients which can be gathered by yourself or bought on the AH if you feel like avoiding the gathering grind. <br />
<br />
Then the creation professions make special items that you must bring to certain objective areas in a quest chain that will create a equipable ring/neck/cloak/weapon upgrade (for the new artifact weapons) that is then up gradable as the game progressives through tiered raid content by repeating the farming process with new tier of gathering items for another item which upgrades your currently not yet legendary equipped item to the same item level as current content which eventually becomes the legendary form which could have bonus abilities etc.<br />
<br />
This would help with their current problem of people not exploring the game by providing a incentive to level up the legendary, which then makes flying a incentive to speed up the farming for alts while also fixing professions by making them have a social use again.</div></div><hr />

There is a difference between doing PvP for PVE legendary, and doing open world activities for open world feature. Get over that.<br />

I have un-subed, but still read about WoW in gaming news; and I really think they could have stuck out just 12 more measly months to prove that non-flying could work for an entire expansion. And in before anyone points out that this expac didn't work, I'd say okay...there were some issues with it, but non-flying wasn't it...maybe nothing to do even with flying would more be the issue.<br />
<br />
Problem is giving flying in the first place, if we never had it, we'd never complain about it...and since they did once dish it out, and you could acquire it for gold, people now expect to always be able to receive it for a once off 5k gold payment. If they stuck to quest attunements for heroics / raiding (e.g. Kara upon BC launch) people would still grit their teeth on their alts but still run that relativly short quest line to get keyed.

I doubt that. Blizzard's reasoning now is the same as before: they want you to explore the world. Since they've relented on flying in general, this is their next solution.<br />

I don't think they'll ever put pay-to-fly back in.<br />

First of all, no. Every customer has an opinion, but damned if they are all valid.<br />
The only point your friend got across was &quot;I don't like it, therefore it sucks and should be changed.&quot; which in an MMO built around feedback from millions of subscribers is just one of the dumbest opinions you can have.

<br />
I'm not subbed atm and if I was I wouldn't personally bother with getting flying in Dreanor as I think its pretty pointless at this stage of the expansion / lack of real world content to do once you get it, but these very same pvpers had to do pve content to get to max level and asking them to do a few more pve quests is not asking very much of them...<br />
<br />
these are the same people that rush to max level and then complain there is nothing to do and that everything should be handed to them on a silver platter<br />

I only wish they would exclude treasure hunter from the requirements, I feel bitter to have to collect things which are part of the reasons we have flying removed. It's artificial inflation of content popularity.<br />

No, everyone has the right to an opinion, that doesn't mean it has to be agreed with. Furthermore Blizzard can't agree with every opinion, can they? Because, y'know, there are different and conflicting opinions. <br />

Lastly, pulling the sheep or fanboy statement before anything else, just makes you look like a massive tool, don't do it, its the argument of someone who doesn't even have anything resembling a counter response.

Actually no, so long as it has been under two months, so it is still weeks. 30 days + has only been 1 month. Singular. It doesn't become months until that second month has passed.</div></div><hr />

That is not absolutely true. Five, six, seven weeks is still a measure of weeks. NOBODY says '1.2 months', after all.<br />

His argument is exactly how I feel about PvP mounts, because I want them, but dislike PvP, so why don't they give us a PvE way of getting them??? Because is makes no sense, that's why. Some things are exclusive through different playstyles, just accept it. How hard is that really.</div></div><hr />

While I agree with the sentiment I don't think flying is the same as PVP mounts. That said I have no problem with Pathfinder, not even with Tanaan diplomat. My issue is that it took 292 days to finally get flying in WoD.</div></div><hr />

That's so wrong. I have been playing on a PvP server from mid-BC to the end of MoP. There has been world pvp with or without flying. The only relevant thing was the number of players in an area. If every player was directed to the same quest hub like Isle of Quel'Danas, Molten Front (both without flying) or Golden Lotus Dailys (with flying), then there also was world pvp. If players were all over the world, than there was no world PvP. <br />
<br />
Moreso, gankers have always profited from flying, because they came in from above on leveling characters without flight (with Cata being the only one exception), and had the upper hand. <br />
<br />
Stop regurgitating the same nonsense over and over. This does not make any of this valid.</div></div><hr />

From my understanding, you can only loot 4 rares once a day, each. So if you medallioned your way to revered, you had large number of alts and you spent more time playing wow in 3-4 days than average player does in 3 weeks. Yes, I got the easy part.

Why? As far as I am aware, you can't fly in BGs/arenas, so why should there be pvp steps to get flying?<br />

<br />
Especially since most of the complaints are probably from people who haven't seen how ridiculously easy it is to get the prerequisites done... except the reps it's one or maybe two evenings of mild riding around the world, doing quests and picking up the treasures you pass as you do it. Not like the PvE content is a challenge to anyone level 100 and either pve or pvp geared. Actually leveling-gear would probably suffice. Just do it! All this &quot;But... why not just hand it to us?&quot; has gotten the game to the point where there are just too few things &quot;worth any effort&quot;. <br />
<br />
And to put it in relation to the 5000g cost it had on BC: You'd have to do all the quests (took about 1-2 days pre zone), get all the gold and then farm a bit on top to have the gold. Meaning in WoD that would equate to what, 250k to 500k gold cost? Hear THAT uproar. I much prefer it to see the ingame relation and earnability. <br />
<br />
Ofcourse they COULD offer several ways of getting it, with the &quot;World PvE way&quot; simply being the best of them... <br />
<br />
Add a 125k gold option for the 100% flying speed thing. OOOH... righ... whine...<br />

<br />
The dude is not 100% correct, and Lore isn't saying that if he &quot;behaves&quot; he'll get his reward. Your analogy relies on an incredible amount of hyperbole.<br />
<br />
What is fact is that flying is an open world PvE mechanic. It cannot be used in BG, it cannot be used in Ashran, and it cannot be used in Arena. As such the achievement to acquire flying should be based on open world, PvE mechanics. <br />
<br />
If people are so hardcore into PvP that it's all they want to do, then they don't need flying. There's really not much to discuss here, is there? There's nothing flying will give them that will be of any benefit what-so-ever.<br />
<br />
Did these same people complain that they are being &quot;forced&quot; to do PvE content and &quot;level grinds&quot; to get to level 100 at the expansion start? If they leveled up doing nothing but PvP - which is highly doubtful - then they can complain about having to do PvE content. Otherwise they are being entitled in thinking that the game should cater to their play style. I mean, if they love PvP so much, doing the dailies and world exploration few a few weeks would be a literal smorgasbord of world PvP opportunities with all the people that are out there doing it - especially in Tanaan. <br />
<br />
I'm really failing to see what the problem is beyond someone either trolling Lore, or being so entitled that being asked to participate in the world environment is too much to ask.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The original question wasn't as polite and reasonable as you're trying to paint it. The person who asked that question knows very well that raiders and PvPers aren't &quot;grounded&quot; with flying, and that they can get it just as easily as everyone else can. His question was framed to be a gotcha &quot;why don't you care about/cater to my playstyle?&quot; His question is to ask why the achievement can't be gained by PvP or raiding, rather than open world content.<br />
<br />
Lore's response reflected that, and was poigiant. If all you're interested in is strictly BGs and raiding, why do you need flying? You can't use flying mounts in those environments and you never have, so why would it be important to you? You don't even need any mode of transport to get to these instances at all if you really don't want to, so what does it matter? It's not like you even need to leave your garrison to gather mats anymore, either.<br />
<br />
Flying only matters if you're doing open world content. If you don't care about open world content, or are so incredibly adverse to it to the point that you have to specifically state how much you hate it, then you don't need flying.</div></div><hr />

Just as the dev explained, flying is related to exploration, so you must to exploration-related stuff to get it. <br />

Frankly, the PvPers these days are getting spoiled. &quot;I PvP, I am special. But I also want easy access to everything else in the game, or else this game sucks.&quot;<br />

The kicker is it's not even a grind at all. It's so ludicrously quick and easy to attain Draenor Pathfinder, that these complaints just sound childish.<br />

Flying will make jumping around in Tanaan a bit easier, and I'm looking forward to it so I can be a completionist with the world treasures. Plus it'll be easier to get to dungeon entrances for Mythics. Just quality of life stuff, really.</div></div><hr />

And can you imagine the pressure at Blizz HQ? I'm not saying they would be in a crying panic or anything but the level of frustration of that delay plus all the other delayed cut stuff on top of that as a sort of end cap to the expansion? I would start to doubt my abilities as a developer if I were one if I were in their shoes. <br />

A lot of people to give a flying shit about flying. Even if you don't like it (which is fine) just accept the fact that other people like things you don't. Now take a deep breath and chill man.

Well, I will be 2 weeks abroad in September, so this won't hurt me much. *shrugs*<br />

Anyway, it's a shame how far this issue has gone.

Bliz has lost the idea you make fun content people want to play, rather than force them to do something or compel them to do it.<br />
<br />
This CM_Lore sounds like a right dick.<br />
<br />
What? No, they think you should earn flying in the expansion's relevant zones each expansion. Totally different from earning the same thing each expansion. The lack of ability to fly in Draenor doesn't make you unable to fly in Outland or Northrend or Azeroth. Different zones in different expansions, that's why you paid for flying in each expansion. They are just changing how you get it.<br />
<br />
Think about your logic. You are basically saying you shouldn't have to level each expansion to get to the new raids, batlegrounds or dungeons. You already earned that this expansion, so why should you have to do the same thing next expansion? For that matter, you already got gear in Hellfire Citadel- you've earned end game gear, why should you have to do future raids to maintain the high-end gear ilevels? Why should you have to do anything in the game after you've alread done &quot;the same thing&quot; in a prior expansion?<br />

<br />
The thing I don't understand is how many people really cancelled their subscription due to lack of flying? My prediction is bringing back flying won't change much in the sub numbers because it doesn't fix the fact that WOD is just not that great of an expansion. Personally I thought the lack of flying was a step in the right direction, but it had as much influence on my enjoyment of the expansion as flying out the gate would've... and that is to say none.</div></div><hr />

You know very well that the reason they make you earn flying and not ground mounts each expansion is because ground mounts don't completely under mind the level design of the zones. Ground mounts do not have that unfortunate side effect.</div></div><hr />

Grow up, people are allowed to have their own opinions. Calling someone a sheep doesn't make you look smart, or above them, or anything else but a pretentious git with nothing useful to say.

You do understand that this is an MMO where everything you do in one expansion is rendered almost completely moot by the next one? Like, all that gear you worked so hard to get, crafted item you spent gold on, enchants, gems, potions, etc, it's all pointless by the next expansion? <br />
<br />
Flying is the same thing. It's always been gated behind a level cap and a gold sink. Always. No one is being &quot;fleeced&quot; by it since it costs you exactly zero real world dollars to get it. The only cost of it is game time. Game time you're already paying for because you're - presumably - doing things other than flying around all day. No grand conspiracy here, bud.</div></div><hr />

I only wish they would exclude treasure hunter from the requirements, I feel bitter to have to collect things which are part of the reasons we have flying removed. It's artificial inflation of content popularity.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the achievement in Legion should be available at launch already. Especially if they once again tie reputations into it, then only few people would have flying in the first weeks of the expansion.<br />

Did Blizzard take away leveling through PvP? I don't really do PvP these days, so I wouldn't know. If they didn't, then I'd say that statement is wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why don't you quit the game you obviously hate so much, then?<br />
<br />
This has ceased to become an empty threat/dare. People actually ARE quitting the game. In fact, a majority of the players have quit the game (down from over 12 million to just over 5 million in 6 months). That might not concern you, but it should. The important part of an MMOG is the MM part. When you cease to have the MM part you will eventually cease to have the OG part.<br />

Even though I'm really looking forward to flying on September 1st I secretly hope that it's delayed another week just to see the internet explode and the epic river of crying and tears over it being delayed.

<br />
I'm unsubbed. I have been for a while, though my time only recently ran out thanks to gold-purchased tokens. I've been playing other things and enjoying them, so I'm kinda hoping for the same-- only because I'm enjoying these other games so darn much and I want to wait a few more weeks before coming back to WoW. I said I'd resub for a month or two after flying was brought back to level alts, max archaeology, play through LFR HFC, etc. I still intend to do that, but I'm going to keep enjoying the heck out of my month of FF XIV first.<br />
<br />
<br />
People complaining is the minority, as always.<br />
<br />
Maybe while there's 14% of players done with flying achievment, 50% of the rest are actually not even interested in it (as I am).<br />
<br />
To be fair, most of the players (about 54%-ish) quit the game before bothering with it, so it's hard to tell. All we can gauge is that a majority of the players (yes, a majority) were not happy with the game. We also know that enough were unhappy enough that no flying was a last straw, and enough people unsubbed after Ion's statements that they backpedaled on it pretty darn quick. I've personally done the achievement, but only because I still had time remaining on my account after I unsubbed. I wouldn't have resubbed just to do the achievement when I could just as easily do it after flying is added. <br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I have no issue with the treasure/questing/exploration achievements. It's been suggested by folks for a while now well before Blizzard suggested it, and it gives some credence to Blizzard saying they want us to explore the world from the ground first. The only one I really don't get is the rep requirement, as it has very little to do with exploration and just an excuse to get people to do those horrible apexis dailies. I seriously miss having actual dailies. Heck, I even miss the MoP dailies gating in comparison to this.<br />
<br />
I miss the tabards and JP system of Wrath and Cata. It gave people a reason to go into dungeons. I'd know people griped about &quot;welfare epics&quot; and all, but it worked okay in TBC and Wrath, and it definitely worked better than what we have now. I wouldn't mind seeing that resurrected in some way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the things lost in the 'OMG only 14% cared enough to get flying meta!!' was that 50% of the players have done Loremaster of Draenor.. but Blizz tacked on a bunch of garbage: tedious rep grinds and freaking apexis dailies. Content that no one wants, but we need because Blizz can barely churn out those in a timely fashion, let alone proper full-fledged quest hubs. But tying access to flying to the content that is only slightly bearable WITH flying means that by the time we actually unlock flight we won't want to do that content ever again... So adding flying in this fashion doesn't actually make things all that better for the players and makes Blizz come across as kind of spiteful.</div></div><hr />

It'S the lame way that should never have been implemented, because a game is SUPPOSED to challenge you. Having the players being confronted with the content of the world of warcraft ist totally FINE. The whole &quot;give stuff the easy way&quot; and &quot;content must be accessible&quot; and &quot;no one should feel forced to do anything&quot;... yeah... not reasonable if you are actually participating or designing a game.

<br />
That Blizz wanted us to 'play through the story' is precisely what they want you to do, though. They stated outright that they removed flying because they wanted players to be immersed in the world and not have the ability to skip areas and objectives that they may otherwise miss if they weren't on the ground. <br />
<br />
Making the 6.2 content part of the flying meta makes complete sense in that context. Imagine the rare spawns, the hidden apexis crystal deposits, the treasures, and bonus areas that you'd skip over if you had flying and could just go to do your quest objectives and be done with it.<br />
<br />
I'm a supporter of having flying back for convenience and quality of life considerations. I'm also a huge supporter of having to finish the world content for the expansion to have it unlocked. &quot;Here, you've done everything we've wanted you to do, you've seen everything we wanted you to see, enjoy the convenience of flying.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Except that the only 6.2 content they added to the meta is.... a rep grind. <br />
<br />
Doing the 6.2 quests one time and it being part of the meta... okay.<br />

<br />
I did all the achievements but the rep. I did a single run through of tanaan/6.2 content... but I'll be fucked if I'm going to do a rep grind for something I could buy for gold in a previous expansion.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thorvath</div><div class="date">2015-08-27, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That Blizz wanted us to 'play through the story' is precisely what they want you to do, though. They stated outright that they removed flying because they wanted players to be immersed in the world and not have the ability to skip areas and objectives that they may otherwise miss if they weren't on the ground. <br />
<br />
Making the 6.2 content part of the flying meta makes complete sense in that context. Imagine the rare spawns, the hidden apexis crystal deposits, the treasures, and bonus areas that you'd skip over if you had flying and could just go to do your quest objectives and be done with it.<br />
<br />
I'm a supporter of having flying back for convenience and quality of life considerations. I'm also a huge supporter of having to finish the world content for the expansion to have it unlocked. &quot;Here, you've done everything we've wanted you to do, you've seen everything we wanted you to see, enjoy the convenience of flying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here's the thing: the 6.2 stuff isn't stuff anyone wants. It's stuff that we begrudgingly accept as a compromise due to the fact that Blizz is too busy spending sub fees on other games to actually deliver proper questlines outside of the expac launch. <br />
<br />
Blizz can 'want' us to see all that non-content in the longest, most dragged out manner possible... but I think WoD has proven that the grindfests of 2004 are just barely tolerated in 2015. The majority of people will say 'screw that' and not even bother. In agreeing to bring back flight Blizz had a chance to appeal to those players who looked at an apexis daily and say 'I'd do it if I could fly.' Then they completely missed the point by trying to force the unpopular crap down our throats anyway.<br />
<br />
'Here, you've done everything, now you can fly' isn't a compromise, it's a passive-aggressive 'eff you for making us bring flying back!'</div></div><hr />

How is reducing the CD from 120 seconds to 90 seconds a nerf ? Please, enlighten us.</div></div><hr />

But I get the fact there is a bunch of lazy people that wants to click something and have everything. And truly believe that is the fun part of the game.<br />
<br />
You could even end up with enough (or close) apexis to buy a mount if you get the achieve.<br />
<br />
A bit late to this, but I just resubbed and was reading up on stuff. <br />
<br />
My main issue with what CM_Lore was saying is his tone, and the fact that he keeps trying to brush it off as &quot;Oh just go run a few dailies for a few days&quot;. It's not the worst rep grind in the game, whoever thinks that hasn't tried to get a nether drake or played Vanilla. But it's NOT just &quot;Oh herpdeder I'm going to go bash out some dailies in 5 minutes&quot; - it's like 19 days of dailies unless you buy the tokens (which on my server would take almost 400k)<br />
<br />
Honestly to a degree, I agree with the guy complaining about the rep grind. I don't feel the same extreme he does, and I don't think they should incorporate some PVP element/alternative to it, but what they intended was for us to &quot;experience&quot; content, and it isn't doing that - it's just a grind with artificial progress barriers. No one is experiencing crap, most people are just rushing through it with addons pointing the way to everything. It's literally just tedious busywork. Earning anything? You're not earning anything, you're just going through the paces - that's it. It's not hard, it's not horrible to have to do some work to get something, but to say this is earning anything is a joke. <br />
<br />
Also, there's a big difference between wanting to click once to get everything, and wanting an alternative to the crap daily system they've had in place since the beginning.</div></div><hr />
