<meta name="description" content="Patch 3.2 Weapon Models HD Preview 
Just like any major update, patch 3.2 will introduce its share of new weapon models. The Coliseum Aliance/Horde models will be used in the Argent Tournament and the Argent Coliseum instances, the PvP 3.2.0 items will most likely be rewarded in future arena seasons.  
 
As usual the screenshots are only available in high-definition, sorry for the few people out there who still struggle with a 15&quot; screen.

With a paladin main, I'm pretty disappointed with the mace models as of late, both 1 and 2 handed. The alliance baby rattle and gear-on-a-stick aren't doing much to change that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deepone</div><div class="date">2009-06-24, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is great to see. Nice balance. I love the Alliance maces and daggers. On the other hand the Horde 2H swords, staves and shields are pretty sweet as well. Not everything looks the way I'd want, but both Alliance and Horde get some very nice looking items that really bring me back to old-school PvP rewards. The day I got my PvP shield at 60 was one I'll never forget. That sucker was epic, not just in rarity.</div></div><hr />

for horde, everything is modeled after what the 3 savage races (orc troll tauren) thinks something should look like. seriously stick cannon lol. blood elf and forsaken opinions don't matter because they are too distant.<br />

<br />
The horde mage tier model is promised to be really blood-elf based (undeads and trolls will cry, or maybe QQ) with a name like &quot;Sunstrider's Regalia&quot; :).<br />
<br />
Anyway I have to say GG blizz cuz these are frankly all badass models. Can't wait to get my hand over one of those 1H horde swords.<br />
<br />
Faction based models is a great idea since it makes players feel alike to their race and alliances (guild and other faction members) rather than looking like another member of your own class but from the other faction.<br />
<br />
I wish tier models will bring some more diffrence between us (and maybe non-set items too) :P.</div></div><hr />

OMG seriously wtf, i knew this would happen but still. Goddamn it blizz, the horde i supposed to be shamanistic, not savages with a cro-magnon level of intelligence. SO why is it that all our stuff has to look like it'd be at home in the hands of some inbred pygmy headhunter from the stone-age. 80% is some combination of Skulls sticks and sharp rocks tied together with leather straps. A few of the pieces look nice, polearms and 1H axes, but seriously the fist weapons? rofl<br />

They are better than the ulduar stuff imo, but not much. My main complaint is that every freaking alliance weapon has a lion on it. Not all alliance are humans... why are there lions on the bow and x-bow... no human is going to be using them :( the gun is sick, but I really wish they would have pulled more influence from the other races, not just human and orcs. I'm not exactly upset about it, I just wish they would have widened the influences for them. Oh well, overall, it's an improvement from other gear. Can't wait to see the new armor (although nothing will be cooler than the gas-mask exterminator of doom T8)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoca812163483</div><div class="date">2009-06-25, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of the stuff looks great, but unfortunately not a lot of it. Especially the 1h Mace Horde-Side the.... bomb-shell with horns... or whatever... what the f*ck is that thing?!<br />
<br />
When they announced that the new stuff would feature Horde/Alliance looks I was really psyched. Guess they actually meant Human/Orc looks, screw the other 4 races of either faction.<br />
<br />
We got <br />
1 Forsaken shield, <br />
1 1H Mace that, I guess, is supposed to be Forsaken, <br />
1 Crossbow that is kinda Forsaken, <br />
1 2H Mace that is supposedly Tauren (really long stretch though, that.... thing....). <br />
1 Forsaken? Off-Hand<br />
1 Staff #1 that could be Tauren, really guessing here....<br />
1 Staff #2 that is.... what? Orc-Troll-mix?<br />
1 Wand that could be.... Forsaken, Troll? No idea.<br />
I can't even begin to guess which racial look those Fist weapons and the Polearm are supposed to be. Orc/Tauren/Troll? *shrug*<br />
<br />
So a grand total of 0 Blood Elf style weapons (yeah, really, why should the CASTER staff feature the looks of the most magically adept/dependent race in the game...), 3 pretty much Forsaken-style weapons, 2-3 Probably Tauren and Troll each. <br />
Rest pretty much 100% Orc.<br />
<br />
I guess the bow will be Blood Elf-y (yeah, woot 1 weapon, a non-magic weapon for a magic-using race (so much that they are the 1 race that got no warriors...), great...), the 2H Axe will be Troll, Tauren or Orc.<br />
<br />
Really, what the heck!? I really, really hope they are working on some more weapons right now or that the T9 sets will be just so freakin awesome that they make up for that massive failure.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bliizzard. I am disappoint.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But then again, the main playerbase of the game that circulates between the age of 12 - 15 must be kept happy aswell. This on top of the emblem change will surely make them subscribe for another six months.</div></div><hr />

If I had to name favorites, it'd be horde/pvp fists, horde 2h sword, all the 1h swords, and the horde gun. Alliance really got shafted with their weapon models, most of them are terrible.</div></div><hr />

You must be alliance, because I don't know a single horde that likes any of these weapons. The 2h sword looks like a piece of iron that was dipped in acid and the polearm looks like a pos staff that should have been in vanilla naxx. Oh and I cant believe you said the horde crossbow looks good, now I know you're alliance. Blizz yet again gives alliance the flashy weapons and horde the dull rusty weapons as usual.</div></div><hr />

I'm actually a horde paladin :P. The two hand sword reminds me of a death knight sword but made out of metallic bone. That's farkin amazing. The polearm is kind of gaudy, in that it's too overwhelming for the head, but it's better than alliance's stupid mini-scythe <br />
<br />
And I don't like that alliance's weapons are so new and flashy, I'd only go alliance for draenei anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how can you possibly say the horde 2h sword is worse than that blob of metal the alliance has? I mean sure, it looks kinda DKish.. but it's still nice.<br />
<br />
Alliance also has the most god awful 1h mace model in existence. <br />
<br />
Only bad horde models are the fists ( spiked mittens! ) and maybe the 2h mace.</div></div><hr />

As a hunter with Staff of the Feral Furies, I'm desperate to find out if I can get a weapon (without having to /roll, lost on Spire of Withering with a 3...) that doesn't look like a trucker's bowels on free burrito day. Hopefully the polearm will be a hunter-friendly upgrade, or the feathered saff will be. Don't really want a Jouney's End on steroids.</div></div><hr />

The Alliance ones are awful (and merely a redo of ones currently in game) and the Horde ones are really great looking - including the little spike at the end of the handle. <br />
<br />
GG Blizz - could you, at some point, try making the Alliance models better looking than the Horde ones? Just once. Thanks.</div></div><hr />
