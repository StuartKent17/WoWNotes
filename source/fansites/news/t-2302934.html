Action is taken when a certain number of players who are not in the same party report you. If enough different people don't like someone enough to take the time to report him, they may be onto something :)</div></div><hr />

Nah. Whinging about toxicity is a really oversensitive thing to do. Hacking, exploiting, griefing are real issues. A 12 year old calling you meanie words when you can ignore/mute/report them is not.<br />

Good luck fighting it - hope that you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater and sanitize even that which wasn't a problem.</div></div><hr />

Meaning there trying to curve players. Otherwise they end up loosing a good % of players needed for the game to survive. So probably you can look at it as the players reporting others are the ones that are gonna kill the game faster then those doing the trolling. I mean its not hard to read into Jeff's word and expressions. But from a blizz standpoint it seems like there not wanting to ban anyone cause then they risk loosing a good amount of there playersbase which is there revenue that funds there games survival.</div></div><hr />

It's a competitive FPS. People are going to get angry. The whole FPS genre has a long history of people getting angry. That's what happens in fast-paced, competitive games.<br />

You can be competitive, and not be a douchebag. Your desire to win is not a license to be racist, offensive, or to harass other people. I've watched Overwatch when my friends play it, and it's the same shit that happens in other games - over the top racism and language that doesn't belong in ANY game, used by try hard toxic players with no anger control, shit talking and exploding in rage constantly - and that's not even getting into the cheaters who this also addresses.<br />

It's an adult concept, watching your mouth. It may take you a few years to understand.</div></div><hr />

That being said, did anyone else watch that video and miss having Kaplan on the WoW team? He at least can manage to talk about actual problems, claim contribution to the problem, and then bring up solutions. Compare that to any of the weasel lawyer talk we get from Ion.</div></div><hr />

I dont think there is a cure though and i dont think that pushing straight up positivity really addresses the situation. People should be encouraged to be team players- the only way to win is by communicating with your team. Its not really about negativity but moreso recognizing that you are more likely to win with your team if you treat them with respect/constructive criticism instead of being an annoying flamelord. Or dey 12 and wont read the forums and will continue to insult yo mama, sooooooo......</div></div><hr />

yeah this is why i stopped playing LoL a few years ago, just made the game not fun. WoW is similar these days it seems, but Blizzard seems more concerned with how people approach their newer games built around microtransactions.<br />
<br />
I still dunno why they have teams or a league for overwatch, its painful to watch unless its a well edited highlight reel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dunno, when someone starts spouting the N word left and right, fully intending it to upset people and troll their own team, I consider that toxic.<br />
I get it, people want to trash talk and get in people's heads. The issue is over time it has gone too far, as 95% of the people who act like that don't even have the guts to talk like that in public because they know what would happen. It's also a little different when you are doing it to your team as blatant trolling.<br />
It's one thing to say mute/ignore the person, it's quite another thing to just allow it to continue.<br />
I'm happy Blizz is seeking ways to have it stop as people that act like immature hate mongers will actually have consequences associated for acting like that.<br />
