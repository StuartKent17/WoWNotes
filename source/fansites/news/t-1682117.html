<br />
The message that comes with the statue uses &quot;stalwart&quot; and &quot;constant companion in our adventures&quot;... so maybe it is a reward for those who had a subscription, uninterrupted, for the entire duration.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it's a brave choice they've made to reward only the veterans who have both been long term subscribers and unwavering in their subscription. <br />
<br />
Someone was going to get cut off. The bravery comes in making that choice, and though a lot of people will be jealous (I'm not saying that to you), we should all instead just admire the people that were that dedicated and congratulate them on their epic IRL loot.<br />
<br />
So gratz everyone getting loot!</div></div><hr />

Dude, if you don't like it just sell it on Ebay... free money. How cool is that?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Blizzards gift to Alliance is unbalanced racials (OP), over 95% representation in 3v3 Arena at 2400 or 2500+. Say thanks to them making you powerful enough that every single good PvP player (and all their followers) have decided to faction change to Alliance! (This is sarcasm...mostly.

<br />
The problem is that right now there are lot of conflicting and unconfirmed rumors abound that basically boil down to &quot;you had to be registered for 10 years without any lapse in subscription to get the gift&quot;. <br />
If that is true, it would mean that there are a shit ton of people that played for ages and will never receive anything, because they unsubscribed for a month or two due to illness, personal circumstances, monetary situations, or, you know, the game having not new content for almost a year.</div></div><hr />

that's not the one veteran players received.. this one is the statue EMPLOYEES got.. it says in the description that it weighs 27 pounds.. but if you look at the UPS tracking detail for the player statue it says 7 pounds so I'm guessing the one players received is a much smaller version than the one employees got</div></div><hr />

There is a big difference between the two. The employee gift statue is about 25 pounds compared to the 7 pound one they gave to players.<br />

Holy !@#$, so many people selling their statue on eBay right now :p People either must really hate it or want to try to cash in with it :p <br />
<br />
So many thankful players :D *cough*<br />

I don't see any on ebay, and I am interested in buying one. If anyone here has one they want to sell PM me!</div></div><hr />

I had one, it broke. I got it when I was there many many years ago. However, what your'e seeing is SIGNIFICANTLY smaller. Mine was between 12-16 inches tall, if I recall. This version is much smaller. <br />

Maybe I phrased that badly.

They had to make a cutoff somewhere - if it was 90 days instead of 60, the people who joined at 93 days would be complaining. Love people complaining when Blizz does something nice but doesn't include them.<br />
<br />

Pretty lame to me.... subbed nov 27 2004.. didnt get squat.<br />

How do you know its not in the mail? Do you have your email and address registered with USPS?<br />

I only missed it by three years! Grrr! I'm so upset at this gesture that doesn't include everyone who ever played. Ever. Blizzard needs to mail out 10 million of these.<br />

Did I do it right?<br />
<br />
Yes. But don't forget to pre-complain as well. &quot;OMG I've been subbed since the beginning this looks so cool, but if I don't get this, its such a shitty gift I dont even care.&quot;<br />

My wife misses out by 5days :-( Still one in the house would be nice.<br />
<br />
However the comments like &quot;I've played for 9 years and I miss out&quot; are a little frustrating. It's not like you've got nothing out of this for 9years. I'm sure you've made a few friends, spoken to poeple from all over the world, maybe even been involved in guild get-togethers? There had to be a cutoff somewhere, if it was 90 days, someone somewhere would still miss out.<br />
As for the money comments, I'd like to provide a quick break down; I pay for my two accounts, my wife's account and my father-in-laws account (Since Sept '05)... so I'm going to look at my main (with a little extra)<br />
<br />
Subscription Fees: ~£860<br />
Game Costs: 3x £30<br />
Collectors Editions: 3x £60<br />
Remote App: ~£40 (Remember that one?)<br />
Second Account: £280 (Game + Fees) Better job = More money, so dual boxed.<br />
Pets &amp; Mounts: £100<br />
Total: £1550 $2400 Probably close to £3k with wife &amp; FiL included ($4500)<br />
<br />
My wife doesn't care she missed out by 5days, my FiL doesn't care he missed out, and frankly I don't mind if I don't get one, disappointed yes, but not in the way some people are crying about it. I've had 10years of fun, I meet and played with people from all walks of life, of all ages, from lots of different countires. I had the honor to be playing a constantly evolving game with my family, that's cost me approx £25 per month. I know people that P155 double that against a wall every weekend.

To the people complaining &quot;I've been a sub for 9 years, why don't I get one?!&quot;- Well idiot, if blizzard gave in and gave it to the 9 year subs, the 8 year subs will moan, then before you know it every player will have one and it won't be shit anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urza29</div><div class="date">2015-01-16, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so i aucutally contacted a gm, via the out of game support page, on battle.net via the live chat, and i basically asked if my account was eligible and if it was if they knew what was the deal with this whole thing. I also updated my address, so i was making sure if it didn't get sent out yet (if i was eligible even) that it was ok. <br />
<br />
The gm was very nice, and we chatted for like 20 minutes, not just about this stuff, but about some suggestions i had, about support and general stuff at blizzard (i told him i loved WOD) <br />
<br />
But basically he says that in the office its driving them all nuts because they have no definitive answer on this thing, as in who gets what, the criteria or anything and that its the million dollar question around support and the other offices and people he has talked to internally, no one seems to know anything and they weren't able to give me a definite answer, although he pulled up my account and said that i had been playing for a very long time, and congratulated me on being so loyal and so on, we chatted about how far the game has come since then <br />
<br />
Overall it was cool experience, aucutally talking to a gm who was as passionate about wow as i am, we talked about how grindy alts are atm in the garrison, about ideas have submitted to make it alt-friendly, and i suggested that the tokens for followers be boa, or that there was a static place (vendor, mission etc) to get more each day, other than dwarven/salvage, because on alts if you want to get your followers ilvl up, it takes forrrever, nickel and dime 3 points at a time..ugh...on my main has most at 630/645+ and have tons of tokens like the 615 weapon ones, going to waste, where my hunter could use those a lot<br />
<br />
Maybe make a daily mission, that has a chest that has say 5-10 of them random ones, that would speed up alts immensely, because lets be honest, the best missions aren't till your followers are 630+, and if the only source each day is 1-2 from missions, and maybe 2-3 from salvage (if you lucky) then yeah doing even 5 followers to 645 for highmaul mission, especially if your alt just hit 100 like this week, you wont be done by next patch, there needs to be some speeding up of progress here<br />
<br />
Or hell just make the tokens give more than 3/6/9..double that, i'd be ok with getting 5 a day if they gave 10/12/15 ilvls the 3/6/9 is to low, or allow us to trade in the kinda worthless apexis crystals for more, or resources...alts getting 10 tokens a day, would be a tremendous help, getting them up to par, mission/gear wise. I hate logging in each day on my hunter and needing a few key followers to 630+, doing my salvage and missions, and gaining +3 weapon and +6 armor on ONE follower..and that being it for the day...progression is a slow crawl<br />
<br />
the gm took down my feedback, agreed that something needs to be done, and that i am not alone in this request, and encouraged me to spread the word, start threads, the more people the better<br />
<br />
10/10 gm service today, i may not got my answer, but at least i know stuff is working internally and satisfaction of playing this game 10 years...priceless</div></div><hr />

You sir are a saviour. Just checked on UPS and I have a shipment from Blizzard today. As far as my history, I have a closed beta account, with a period of two months June/July 2014 where I unsubbed during MOP. So it is confirmed that you can still receive the statue if you have unsubbed. Not sure as to what the cutoff will be to actually receive the statue, but at least 2 months is verified.</div></div><hr />

I can imagine Blizzard saying back: &quot;Fuck you, for displaying the self-entitled, self-serving, &quot;me me me me me&quot; mentality.

Of course the questions about who is eligible. I know I won't be, didn't start until BC. But beyond all that, will this be a one time thing or can people expect a gift upon reaching 10 years subbed? Guessing it will be a one time thing because I can't see them spending that much, but that would seem the most fair thing to do and would be very straightforward as a requirement. If it's a one time thing that is really harsh for those who are really close to that time and why should their 10 years be worth less than somebody else's 10 years? Because the length was separated by a month? Send them theirs next month then and make it a 10 year veteran reward going forward. Who knows, they might actually do that. But again, there is so much we don't know at this point.</div></div><hr />

Jeez. This takes the cake for the most entitled complainer I've seen on this thread. Brutal. I can't believe people have it in them to be this rude. You really should be ashamed of yourself.

Not the same exact thing, is it? That one was an employee gift. Might be from the same company or whatever, but probably made at different times, and employee gift=more rare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't matter. You qualify for the gift if you started playing within the first 60 days of release. If you bought the game and subbed at day #61 - bummer, you're out.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Honeyprime</div><div class="date">2015-01-16, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So can the people who received one confirm 100% that you need a completely uninterrupted sub since 60 or less day from release?<br />
<br />
As I posted in the other thread, I unsubbed for a month or two mid 2005 or 2006 (can't remember the year) and I got a e-mail from UPS My Choice that I had one on the way. Been continuously subbed since mid December 2004 other than that.</div></div><hr />

Thanks blizzard. Guess I wasn't &quot;loyal&quot; enough in the sense that I didn't discover the game period until tbc and then didn't want to waste my fucking money on no content in the last part of a shitty expansion. In other words, the only people getting this are the moronic fanboys who do free publicity for blizzard, take it up the ass on everything they do, and attack and morally rape anyone who &quot;disagrees&quot; with their corporate masters. So it's a reward for their unwavering, religious devotion to their god that is blizzard, literally. You know what, I don't want it, and I'd hit the fucking piece of shit with a hammer if I did get it and mail it back to the motherfuckers. Fuck you blizzard, and fuck every single person who got one. I'd fucking kill you if I knew where you lived.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BleauBird</div><div class="date">2015-01-16, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that right now there are lot of conflicting and unconfirmed rumors abound that basically boil down to &quot;you had to be registered for 10 years without any lapse in subscription to get the gift&quot;. <br />
If that is true, it would mean that there are a shit ton of people that played for ages and will never receive anything, because they unsubscribed for a month or two due to illness, personal circumstances, monetary situations, or, you know, the game having not new content for almost a year.<br />
<br />
Doesn't boildown to that... My account was created on Nov 23rd, 2004. I wasn't subbed July-October 2009 due to a divorce. and I got my gift.</div></div><hr />

This takes the cake for the most entitled complainer I've seen on this thread. Brutal. I can't believe people have it in them to be this rude. You really should be ashamed of yourself. Just, wow. It's a free gift to people who have been subbed for 10 years. There has to be a cut off point on eligibility. Grow up a bit and realize that the world doesn't revolve around you. Sheesh.<br />
<br />
It's a collector's item likely worth thousands of dollars. If I missed it by a few months I'd be pissed, too.</div></div><hr />

I'm so upset at this gesture that doesn't include everyone who ever played. Ever. Blizzard needs to mail out 10 million of these.<br />
<br />

<br />
Nope you failed... the total number of people who have ever played is higher than that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My credit card expired before my sub renewal at one point, so arguably for a couple days. It depends on whether or not they billed before my time expired. That was the only potential time though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">subanark</div><div class="date">2015-01-16, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder how many gold farmer accounts will receive this. Since we all see the damn gold seller for months because it was never banned<br />
Not very many. This isn't so much a &quot;veteran&quot; reward, as it is an &quot;early adopter&quot; reward. The game didn't really pick up until after their cutoff point. Gold farmers really didn't pick up on the popularity, and people were still leveling back then, so it was hard to tell how much of an impact it would be.<br />
<br />
For others: Don't expect any other long standing account rewards, they did it because they could afford to do so for a few people. If they moved it up 6 months, it would be much more expensive to do. If they gave one to everyone, it would probably cost them 5% of WoW overall gross to do so (assuming $10 for cost and shipping). You could probably hire and support 2 more designers for an entire year for that much.</div></div><hr />

They may have done that, with time subbed = 10 years - 2 months. People have missed about that much time and still gotten it. Just a guess though.</div></div><hr />

Yes it has to have been constant. Pretty lame for 10 years of active subscription/loyalty and money</div></div><hr />

Way to alienate half your player base. Why would an alliance player want a statue of some random orc!?<br />
<br />
Not this again :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
You do know that Metzen mains a Human Paladin don't you? A bunch of the other Devs also Main Alliance toons too. So tell me again how that makes them Horde biased?</div></div><hr />

It has more or less been confirmed that it doesn't have to be constant, read some of the posts on pages 9 and 10.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only cheapens the entire thing for both the players and the employees who were around back then. <br />
<br />
/sigh...<br />
The player version is smaller; the employee one weighs 2 stone (25lb/11kg), whereas the player one is smaller, desk-sized. And good lord, why would you complain? They didn't have to do ANYTHING. This is an awesome gesture from them.</div></div><hr />

Haha right? I love how they forget that half the people won't want an orc. I'm glad my account isn't old enough now, this would be like when your grandma gets you a really unfortunate sweater and watches you open it. It would end up collecting dust in my closet, or on ebay.</div></div><hr />

Same here except mine was created 12/04/04. I'm not whining...just curious. And IF you have to be constantly subbed (which seems not to be the case) I wonder if you unsubbed because you were in the WoD beta for 3-4 months..if they consider that?</div></div><hr />

estimated retail value of statue (not including sentimental value)<br />
<br />
Actually, that is the value of playing the game for 10 years.<br />
<br />
The statue is a bonus for that, you didn't pay for it, you paid for the game and the service around the game.<br />
<br />
Stop using stupid logic.</div></div><hr />

And I can confirm that others have said they have had their subs lapse and got it. We just dont know and I wish Blizz would just tell us so we can all stop bitching/worrying about it, me included.</div></div><hr />

I don't think that it is the same statue. Just read the description. This one is also bigger than the gift as far as I know.</div></div><hr />

Great thread on the official forums to ask UPS if you have a package on the way, period. I didn't receive an email, and checked UPS directly and just with my name and ZIP I see I do have a package waiting for me. GREAT discovery!<br />
<br />
Regarding qualifying details, my account is created 12/8/2004, with several small lapses in service. YOU DO NOT NEED 10 YEARS OF NON-STOP SUBSCRIPTION. I had small lapses of 3-4 days peppered throughout my account history(I'd pay with a prepaid card, it would lapse on a Wednesday workday, and I'd renew on the weekend when I could play). I had 33 comp days in 1, 2, 3 &amp; 5 day increments from service interruptions only throughout all ten years, and 45 days of no active subscription peppered throughout 10 years of renewal. I'm actually proud of that small savings personally, not paying for a few hours one night a month adding up to that much. Also I did the Diablo 3 Annual Pass deal and never let that lapse.<br />
<br />
So yeah, look into it, the qualifications aren't as strict as you might think.</div></div><hr />

I was in closed EU Beta and started retail on launch day but pretty sure I might've missed a week or so here and there.<br />
<br />
Do they really exclude you if you like go on vacation for 2 weeks and your sub randomly ran out while you were gone?<br />
<br />
Also have anyone from EU received one?</div></div><hr />
