Reorigination Array Clarifications<br />
do you need the Archive of the titans or laser matrix trait equipped to earn them or can you have another trait on that piece of gear and when you switch you will still have it ??<br />
Nope! You don't need to have a piece with the trait to earn progress. So if you complete the quest for 5 weeks on Normal killing Taloc, MOTHER, and Fetid and then finally get say the plate helm with Archive of the Titans on week 6 from Taloc, then when you select Archive of the Titans and equip it it should show you have 5 stacks of Reorigination Array, and the tooltip should read that you need to kill 2 more bosses as you killed Taloc already for the week.<br />
<br />
The progress is character based so if you get a better Azerite piece that provides Reorigination Array then you still have the same stack level. So there's no punishment for swapping items at all.<br />
<br />
I mean, if you run your alts through RaidFinder every week, they shouldn't have any trouble keeping up with your main in Normal/Heroic/Mythic.<br />
LFR does in fact grant it and the pieces as well. You essentially have 4 chances per week of getting the piece if a singular boss drops one that you need (LFR/Normal/Heroic/Mythic) plus seals plus weekly quests that grant you a cache that contains a random piece of Uldir gear, guildies or other raiders not needing and willing to trade, etc. There is an insane amount of opportunities to get the pieces that have them, as well as you always earn progress each week toward the stacking as long as you get the three boss kills on any level. You can do 2 bosses on normal and 1 on heroic or any other combination of difficulties and it still credits the same.<br />
<br />
And another thing that I notice, as a BM hunter I got 32% mastery and 23% crit with my equiped gear, but the buff says I gonna get 75 crit per stack, shouln't I got mastery (my high secondary stat)?<br />
It will be the highest stat value, not percentage.<br />
<br />
My understanding is this is effected by temporary buffs too(?) So someone hits bloodlust/heroism, and half the raid's bonus swaps to haste. Intended?<br />
<br />
Heroism shouldn't have this effect as it doesn't work by increasing your Haste rating. Stat rating based trinket procs might, though.<br />
Correct. Heroism/Bloodlust doesn't provide a raw stat value increase, its just a flat 30% haste buff. So Heroism/Bloodlust wouldn't affect it. Trinkets could though if they do proc and that is enough to push you in one direction or another.<br />
<br />
This also doesn't stack with multiple traits that provide Reorigination Array.<br />
<br />
So even if i had 3 of archive of the titans or laser matrix it wouldn't give me 750 secondary for each just one instance of 750 at 10 stacks?<br />
<br />
Also M+ has no equivalent to this, how is m+ supposed to be its own progression path if there isn't azerite gear that only works in M+ and not in raid?<br />
Correct. You would only have one stack of Reorigination Array and multiples of Archive of the Titans or Laser Matix wouldn't affect it in any way. It would still function as if there was only one. However the effects from Laser Matrix and Archive of the Titans should behave and stack like similar traits, just not Reorigination Array.<br />
<br />
Correct, Reorigination Array only works while you're in Uldir.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you miss a raid week are you SOL on a stack?<br />
<br />
Edit: Reading the Blue Post that got left off it sounds like there is no catch up mechanic for it. If you only did 2 bosses, or missed last week, you miss out on your +1</div></div><hr />

<br />
It only stacks up to a maximum of 10. So for most players missing one week will not be a huge issue...if you are in any kind of guild that requires you to have max stacks possible in the first 10 weeks of the raid...then....well...yes, you are out of luck, but you definetly are not the norm, either.</div></div><hr />

The buff is still gated weekly.<br />
<br />
So we're in week two, the maximum number of stacks is two. If you haven't raided Uldir at all, but you get a piece of Origination Azerite from the weekly chest, for example, you can kill 6 bosses and get two stacks.</div></div><hr />

That's not what they said tho. They said it's a weekly quest, they don't say that the quests &quot;stack&quot; if you miss out on a week. It is basically &quot;kill 3 bosses, get a stack&quot; ONCE a week.</div></div><hr />

Hidden quest in the background. You dont get it in your quest log, it just happens without you knowing. Kill three bosses and you get an extra stack. You will know you have completed it that week when you see your buff go up.</div></div><hr />

It's a hidden quest as stated in a post from yesterday.<br />

&quot;There is a hidden weekly quest to kill 3 Uldir bosses, granting another stack of Reorigination Array.&quot;</div></div><hr />

The question itself was actually quite nonesensical... Purely the fact that the bonus does not work anywhere outside of Uldir, it actually makes m+ BETTER than raids because that gear works everywhere including raids. <br />
<br />
They actually implemented this to make raids not immediately obsolete but the benefit is completely limited to Raids only, but the m+ community complains about it?? Very weird.</div></div><hr />

Not the health increases, but the heal throughput on AE heals as bigger raids tend to have more healers.</div></div><hr />
