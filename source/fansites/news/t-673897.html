This is pretty cool. I saw the damage being taken off, and the debuff, but was a bit disappointed with the amount (something like 77 per tick... Fairly sure health regains faster than that). Good to see that it increases. I hope it's a semi-serious towards the end, cuts down on idle time.</div></div><hr />

It should be. It should be harder actually, this is the final instance. They should give hardcores something to do in this expansion.

&quot;The rewards in the raid dungeon start at item level 251 in the normal mode with 10-player encounters, increase to item level 264 in the Heroic mode mode with 10 players and the normal mode with 25-player encounters, and then finally reach item level 277 in the Heroic mode with 25 players.&quot;<br />

<br />
Prince was harder than Lootreaver.<br />
Vashj/Kael were some of the hardest bosses in the game.<br />
Can't comment on Kalecgos vs Illidan - didn't get that far in BC.<br />
<br />
FL (really, the whole antechamber) was easier than Malygos/Sapphron/Sarth+3.<br />
Easy mode TotC is actually ALL easier than Yogg.<br />
<br />
So before you get all elitist on us - remember that: <br />
This is the first of 12 bosses.<br />
This is the PTR (Publlic TEST Realm)<br />
This is normal mode.<br />
<br />
There's no reason this incarnation of this boss (or even the live version) should be harder than Heroic Anub - a boss that most guilds still haven't killed yet.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it will be the source of many wipes. Unless your tank gets hit for like 99% at the same time his 1% aura ticks, it shouldn't be a problem. I think it's more just to add one more thing to watch through the whole instance. It will also help (hopefully) keep downtime and afk'ers to a minimum. I like it.</div></div><hr />

I also wanted to add like others might have as well, but not only were Guilds downing this boss I was in a pug that downed him as well as many others who reported on the PTR Forums so this boss hopefully with tuning won't be as easy, but if a pug can get him down within a few hours of PTR testing then well... We are not off to a good start, but it's his first night to shine and he needs to be taken back to the shop and get some new buffs before hitting the show floor again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I understand, the one being tested is the 25 man normal mode. Blizz still wants everyone to see the raids, as they have stated. So this one is pretty much for the guilds who don't have a million hours a week to get 25 people geared up for the good stuff.<br />
<br />
I think that people should not QQ until they see what the hardest variation is going to be. At which point they will still QQ and continue to play this game for some odd reason.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, because the first boss of the raid, on the test server, is the best indicator of the difficulty of the other 11 bosses of the raid when they go live. This is ignoring the fact that it is the test server, and will more than likely (like most other tests) be tuned accordingly by the time it goes live. But hey, complaining is the status quo for most players.</div></div><hr />

Did you think illidan was last boss in bc? we got sunwell after the main raid for that xpac and i have a feeling they'll do the same just to give you tough talkers something to really complain about :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just like FL, XT, and Beasts on non-heroic/non-hard-mode, yeah. Go figure, Wrath raid design philosophy is still Wrath raid design philosophy. Hopefully Heroic is tuned to keep the top 100 guilds happy until Cataclysm. Normal is for everyone to see the content, just like it has been for the past year.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why people are so surprised.<br />
<br />
HEROIC Marrowgar should be the gear check, not this normal testing. Any even remotely serious raiding guild should get 11/12 within a couple of weeks. That's what normal is FOR. Content consumption, not challenge. Hate on it all you like, it's been the core philosophy since Wrath launched and this being ICC isn't going to change Blizzard's tune. If the Heroic-tuned stuff dies without any wipes, then you can argue serious retuning is needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Anyone wearing ICC gear to get their first kill on the first boss in ICC isn't exactly a progression raider. Blizzard's not going to design a boss that drops 264 gear and requires 264 gear to beat and put him in front of all the 264 gear.<br />
<br />
The average raider for whom Marrowgar-25N is serious progression won't be wearing full 258 stuff and full T9.5H. He'll be in 232/345 stuff, with maybe one or two pieces from ToGC. The raid progression won't be Ulduar -&gt; Firefighter -&gt; ToC -&gt; ToGC -&gt; ICC, it'll be Ulduar (or the new heroics) -&gt; ToC10/25 -&gt; ICC. Anyone wearing ToGC gear to Marrowgar over-gears him, and Marrowgar is supposed to be a faceroll to him.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I really hope this guy is actually alot harder than any TOC 25man normal mode otherwise it will be huge fail that they instantly overtake toc25 HM gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
The goal of ToGC gear (hardmode gear) is to give you a leg-up on ICC hardmodes. Do you want to walk up to Arthas (or even hardmode anyone) on Weeks 1-3 in 245/264 or 258/264? After the first few weeks, no-one cares about how far you got in ToGC, it's all about ICC. Just like no-one now cares whether you get pre-3.2 Firefighter or One-Light, it's about how far into ToGC you are, or how many attempts left.<br />
<br />
Here's how it'll break down. ICC comes out, and week 1, everyone and their grand-mother races for the server-first Arthas kill. The super-hardcore serious raiders (Tribute to Mad Skill or better) get him down in one night, the hardcore (currently wiping on Anub or not getting any tribute) get him the second night. Good raiders spend the week wiping on Arthas. Joe Average raider (who's clearing Anub and wiping on Heroic Beasts at the moment) gets about 7/12 the first week in two nights of raiding.<br />
<br />
Week 2, everyone with Arthas down races for the hardmodes, going after the easy ones first. The super-hardcore get most of them the first week, and then wipe on Heroic Arthas for days. The good raiders finally get Arthas (or maybe not until week 3), and Joe Average gets to 8/12. Ensidia/Stars/Premonition-level guilds get Heroic Arthas on week 3 or 4. The &quot;average hardcore&quot; takes another month or two to get him, just in time for Cataclysm to be 3 months away. Good raiders race to kill Heroic Arthas before the 4.0 nerfs/changes. Joe Average guild gets regular Arthas 2-3 months in, and spend their last few months chipping away at &quot;easy hardmodes&quot;. PUGs remain forever locked at 4-6/12.</div></div><hr />

I think your extimates for Joe Average guilds are off. Joe Average guilds cleared normal ToC bosses on the same night they were released and cleared Normal Uld in a month or so, 2-3 months for normal Arthas would mean normal Arthas is actually fairly challenging.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm somewhat amused at how people, after Naxx 25, after Ulduar, after ToC are still saying &quot;this is the first boss, we have no evidence the instance will be easy&quot;. Wake up. Normal mode will be a joke.<br />
Look at ToC. It's the easiest instance ever seen in WoW in normal mode. And even if the hardmodes have locked out the vast majority of guilds (as it should be), it took most guilds less time to get on Anub than Firefighter alone took back then in Uld.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's Joe Terrible. I play on a low pop Pvp server and Ulduar 25 was pugged way before ToC was released.<br />
On the first night of Ulduar's release (well, the night after since that Wed was nigh unplayable) there was a number of guilds that would have later disbanded or never done hardmodes who killed Kologarn. I repeat, it's a small pvp server and we probably had more than 10 guilds who cleared to Auri in the first week. Who the hell got stuck on Kologarn?</div></div><hr />

All the hardcore raiders bitch and moan that content is cleared too easy when it hits live.<br />
Maybe if they couldn't see any of it on PTRs they may not actually get to know what it's like.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know it's 'tweaked' before hitting live but the basics of the fight still exist, you still learn the surroundings of the raid and things like ideal placement of the boss.<br />
<br />
Seriously, one reason that TBC raids were much harder is because for a start, all the hardcore raiders back then didn't actively sit on the PTRs waiting to see the latest boss available.<br />
<br />
If you true hardcore raiders really want a challenge, stop killing the bosses on PTRs and wait for them to hit live so it will be a fresh encounter. Not one you can clear within a week of release -.-</div></div><hr />

The &quot;it's the PTR argument&quot; is trite.<br />
<br />
Besides, you're failing to see the problem. The current state of WoW removed any middle ground.<br />
<br />
Normal content is too easy for everybody.<br />
Hardmode content is hardly accessible for people who managed to succeed in the old format without having to resort to playing 4-5 times a week.<br />
<br />
So the &quot;normal&quot; raiders right now are the most unsatisfied ones. Because the normal content is puggable, and they clear it in a couple of weeks. Then come the Hardmodes (which are legitimately hard) and uninteresting because they require more dedication than &quot;normal&quot; raiders want to devote and mostly because for people who play for fun redoing the same instance 4 times is hardly a pleasure.<br />
<br />
There's a huge number of raiders who play for the pleasure of downing the final boss of an instance after a good challenge and then wait for the new content to be released. They don't care if the take 3 months to do what &quot;pros&quot; do in 3 weeks, they just want to be able to do the same in their own time, and get respect for that. Now they have some puggable content that is disgustingly easy, and then some hardcore content that forces them to redo the same normal content over and over (and probably challenges them over what they want to be challenged) and nothing that is balanced around their own level.<br />

Hardly a point where bosses are oneshotted on laggy PTRs and die within 2 days of release on the PTR.<br />

You fail to realize that what people wants isn't C'thun pre-nerf. It's Leotheras, and it's normal Arthas being about as hard as Kael was. If you are oblivious of how pathetically easy WotLK is compared to even TBC, I don't know what.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that the new format isn't progressive. <br />
<br />
In the old format, raiders would be successfull depending on how far they got. Bosses got harder and harder and you had something new to try every time. You wanted to defeat Leo because you wanted to see Vashj. You had to do Astro to do Kael.<br />
<br />
In the new format, the normal mode is pathetic, and you see the entire instance every week. Then the novelty is gone, and you redo the same things with bigger numbers, and everything is &quot;hard&quot; from the get go, and often the first boss is harder than what comes after (see ToC), and you can see that most people who play for fun and not epeening will hardly be motivated to wipe hours on Twins Hard to be able to do Anub (again).</div></div><hr />

sigh i dont understand people who think this should have one difficulty lv if almost every game out there does have difficulty lvs. If i were to play, lets say, god of war 3.

<br />
You fail to realize that what people wants isn't C'thun pre-nerf. It's Leotheras, and it's normal Arthas being about as hard as Kael was. If you are oblivious of how pathetically easy WotLK is compared to even TBC, I don't know what.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you missed what people are saying.<br />
<br />
Normal mode IS supposed to be like this. The old raiding design falls on the hard modes.</div></div><hr />

They would have 3 or 4 modes and i can put it up on easy mode kill the last boss like that or hardmode and kill the last boss like that too.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt get pissed at the game saying &quot;ohh dam game, ppl can kill the same boss in easy mode&quot;<br />
<br />
Remember there is no &quot;right&quot; difficulty lv.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a sound argument. The main problem here is that in a game like GoW, you clear it once (twice?) and you're done. MMOs are an excercise of repetition, so it should be fun from the get go. And second, this would work but the problem in WoW is that you only have &quot;Easy Automatic&quot; and &quot;Raiders Must Die&quot; levels - expecially when it comes to time commitment.<br />
<br />
As I said, middleground is lost. You go straight from Karazhan to (proportionally) Sunwell at every single instance. The vast majority of people wouldn't hate something on TK/BT level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the old format, raiders would be successfull depending on how far they got. Bosses got harder and harder and you had something new to try every time. You wanted to defeat Leo because you wanted to see Vashj. You had to do Astro to do Kael.<br />
<br />
In the new format, the normal mode is pathetic, and you see the entire instance every week. Then the novelty is gone, and you redo the same things with bigger numbers, and everything is &quot;hard&quot; from the get go, and often the first boss is harder than what comes after (see ToC), and you can see that most people who play for fun and not epeening will hardly be motivated to wipe hours on Twins Hard to be able to do Anub (again).<br />
<br />
But that is not Blizzard's fault, but everyone's guilds or mentalities. The hardmodes are there.</div></div><hr />

I think you missed the part on the progessive design and on how when you're playing for fun and you'd been forced to go through the same 4 bosses every week thanks to gathing before even being able to &quot;tackle&quot; the hardmodes, the fun is already gone.<br />
<br />
And again, the Hardmode format is hardly balanced or progressive. Look at ToC. You can be A) 0/5, B) 4/5, C) 5/5.</div></div><hr />

But that isn't the discussion at hand. That's the design of ToC, not the normal/hardmode choice.<br />

Well it sort of worked with ToC, didn't it?<br />

Heck, most people cleared Uld till Auri on their first night. I understand you want to defend the game, but open your eyes. The vast majority of people can't care less if Arthas hardmode will take 2 weeks more than Anub hardmode.<br />
<br />
The hardest hardmodes being too hard is a problem that concerns 10% of the raiding population. The normal modes being too easy is a collective issue.</div></div><hr />

2. You failed. Go read http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=20566566514&amp;sid=1 <br />
That's the feedback thread of this test session. Obviously you didn't read it, else you would have realise that maaaaany testers downed him in Pug's, sometimes with noobs in their groups (like a Palatank gemming Int). And they didn't have all 258l, many of them had only 226/232/245. So, BEST GEARED AND HIGHEST SKILLED PLAYERS IN THE WORLD ? Rofl, no.<br />
<br />
My opinion is that LM is definitly FL-like, easy-peasy, just some kind of raid-check to spot who's sleeping before the big fights behind, like 5 or 6 bosses ahead. It's a daily, it will be simple. I'm deeply convinced that ICC will be just as Ulduar : beautifull environment, decent level and progression for everyone (normal, heroic, 10, 25), some epic encounters with funny mechanics, large part for lore, phat loots, vent screams when Arthas will go down for the first time. What else ?<br />

Then you admitted that hardmodes are not easy. Therefore, your argument that &quot;WoW is easy&quot; is null and void.<br />

Specially his Bone Spike Graveyard looks like an attention-check.<br />
&quot;Hurls a massive bone spike which impales any enemies in the way. 3 sec cast, deals 10% health per sec for 5 minutes or until killed. Spikes have 37900HP in 25-Man Normal Mode.&quot;<br />
<br />
This, together with the already present 1% health damage every 3 seconds, will put a giant strain on the healers if they're going to have to start healing everyone hit by a bone spike. It's going to tell whom amongst the raiders is on the ball or not. I am guessing the boss right after him is going to be the gear-check one.</div></div><hr />

WoW is a RPG, so what do you need in an RPG?<br />

A raid wide aura like that fits very well in with the lore of The Lich King and the whole Icecrown theme, the reason for them not self taking damage from it would be that they're already undead. so quit your game mechanics for a minute and think about what kind of game it is instead.<br />

<br />
Besides, you're failing to see the problem. The current state of WoW removed any middle ground.<br />
<br />
Normal content is too easy for everybody.<br />
Hardmode content is hardly accessible for people who managed to succeed in the old format without having to resort to playing 4-5 times a week.<br />
<br />
So the &quot;normal&quot; raiders right now are the most unsatisfied ones. Because the normal content is puggable, and they clear it in a couple of weeks. Then come the Hardmodes (which are legitimately hard) and uninteresting because they require more dedication than &quot;normal&quot; raiders want to devote and mostly because for people who play for fun redoing the same instance 4 times is hardly a pleasure.<br />
<br />
There's a huge number of raiders who play for the pleasure of downing the final boss of an instance after a good challenge and then wait for the new content to be released. They don't care if the take 3 months to do what &quot;pros&quot; do in 3 weeks, they just want to be able to do the same in their own time, and get respect for that. Now they have some puggable content that is disgustingly easy, and then some hardcore content that forces them to redo the same normal content over and over (and probably challenges them over what they want to be challenged) and nothing that is balanced around their own level.<br />
<br />
WoW at the moment is a game where literally you raid one night a week or you play every single day.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's just so not true, i belong to a 10 man guild, we raid one day per week for 3 hours. We clear normal mode toc10 then go to hard mode, this week we're on anub with 35 tries left (making use of the superb raid save extension). Just cos hard modes are hard doesn't suddenly mean we have to play a lot more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Top guilds are clearing raids on the PTR, they would destroy them on live in a week or so even without testing.<br />
<br />
<br />
If that's the case then, why do said top guilds even go on to the PTRs?<br />
So they can get a heads up, learn tactics, start their (ridiculous) number crunching all so they can get world first kills.<br />
<br />
I just don't get why Blizz don't have in-house testing. It's not like they don't have enough staff.<br />
And as I said earlier, that way absolutely NO-ONE will have a heads up or any kind of head start on any encounters.<br />
<br />
Then if they clear the new raid on the first week of live, people may actually be impressed.</div></div><hr />

Once you actually fought the boss though, getting all 40 people to actually execute that concept in a format that will be successful was the real challenge.<br />

Old WoW was only superior to WoTLK-WoW in terms of difficulty. You're a fucking retard if you think farming for hours for flasks on a 4 hour wipe fest 6 nights a week on C'thun is fun.<br />

This, together with the already present 1% health damage every 3 seconds, will put a giant strain on the healers if they're going to have to start healing everyone hit by a bone spike. It's going to tell whom amongst the raiders is on the ball or not. I am guessing the boss right after him is going to be the gear-check one.<br />
<br />
The spikes really aren't that bad as long as multiple people don't get hit, but the spikes have very low HP. Although, I'm pretty certain they also deal 12k damage on impact, which is actually reported in their spell detail but not mentioned in the description at all.</div></div><hr />

True, but it's like Hodir's Flash Freeze in that regard. One person being hit isn't a disaster, break them out and be done with it. But it takes dps away from Hodir and it takes dps away from freeing the NPCs.<br />
One person impaled won't be too big a deal. But you know how some classes like to stack up on eachother, and then depend on eachother to run away in case of AoE. With three or four people hit, it's going to take some seconds to get them all out. This eats healer mana, it eats dps attention.<br />
<br />
Just like Flash Freeze they will most likely be laughably easy to dodge, but you have to Pay Attention (tm). And so many people fail to pay attention to anything these days. *cough*DeepBreath*cough*</div></div><hr />

ICC is a new hybrid design, where you can change from normal to hardmode and vice-versa on the fly. So, it's only 2 raid IDs.</div></div><hr />

WoW is easy. Some encounters require patience and a lack of errors, but not making a mistake isn't &quot;difficult&quot;, it's just something that comes over time. But at it's core, WoW is not a difficult game. Most hardmodes don't add &quot;difficulty&quot;, they add DPS requirements, and require encounter knowledge. They're not difficult though.<br />

I play on Darksorrow EU, PVP. One of the worst server for PVE in all Europe.<br />
<br />
This is the 10 men progress list:<br />

<br />
I haven't double checked, but I'm confident that there's some guilds that have Mad Skills 10 and don't even raid 25s.<br />
You won't take much to find out who I am and where I play. There's multiple people (at least 2 raids) who cleared with Mad Skills in my guild, and we're really nothing special. If you look me up, you'll find out that I achieved all 10 men drakes before new content trivialized them, and ToC 10 hardmodes are what made me decide that 10s were the first thing to cut to reduce WoW time. We got to Anub hard 10 the night Anub was unlocked, going there after the 25 men raid and getting to him with 45 tries available on our first run. I never looked back.<br />
<br />
If you think an instance that gets cleared &quot;hardmode&quot; without a single wipe the same week it's released is &quot;hard&quot;, you're delusional.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2009-10-16, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I know.

Or daily heroics all over again :-[<br />
<br />
<br />
The only other reason, besides soft reseting the gear (wich they really did and, honestly, we didn't need since we're a few months away from the expansion pack gear reset), is to keep the heroics still going on for new players.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatelly, a plan not that well executed, since ToC is ridiculous easy, Onyxia also gives Triumph and Koralon give both Triumph AND T9. Since you can pug all 3 raids without problems, many players could farm all the Emblems they needed really fast, many also got some Trophy of the Crusader, others even won the pieces from Koralon (I've got 3/5 T9 for one of my alts after 2 weeks of Koralon going live! And that because the ilvl245 Legs dropped twice, could have dropped the Chest intead, lol)...<br />
<br />
Now they're trying the &quot;Raid Daily&quot; concept. Didn't read all about it yet, but looks like a weekly quest, and not something that will change each day, so you could do all the raid bosses quests, one per day before the reset. If it's really a weekly quest and they don't give the Heroic 5man Daily the same emblem, that will keep things rolling, at least for raids. Even if they give it, without a new VoA boss dropping both Frost Emblems and T10 gear and a new &quot;old world raid at 80&quot; also dropping Frost Emblems, things will be a little bit slower and will keep heroics rolling for more time.<br />
<br />
Of course, if they're keeping the Tier/Emblem system from ToC.</div></div><hr />

10-man heroic is too easy in my opinion and far away from the original Sartharion3D (10-man) or even Ulduar 10-man Hardmodes. If you can stack some melee für Anub'arak, Tribute to Insanity is easy. If you don´t it may be some sort of challenge.<br />
<br />
It all starts with fights not lasting even 6 Minutes...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason you're struggling on it is probably only and simply gear. If you don't raid 25s, you have a sensible gear disadvantage and the easier the content is, the more gear will matter.<br />
<br />
If you had 25 men gear you would probably felt like me while I watched &quot;hardmode&quot; bosses go down like flies the first time we actually tried them. I loved the 10 men format (because it allowed me to play in a more relaxed environment and often with greater individual challenges then 25s) but the difference in challenge between ToC 10 and ToC 25, and more importantly between ToC 10H and Uld 10H is so huge that's not even funny.</div></div><hr />

ToC10 drops 232 gear. ToC10 heroic drops 245, ToC25 drops 245.<br />
<br />
Your guild have cleared ToC25 several times, meaning you at least have around 10 in 245 gear. Meaning you now are equal to ToC10 heroic gear wise.<br />
<br />
A 10man guild (as the one you quoted) will have around 232 gear and some few 245 from pugs or Emblems.<br />
<br />
Content tends to be easy when you are in better gear then intended for the specific content. You gonna whine that VH HC is to easy as well in 245 gear?</div></div><hr />

But still, this changes nothing, because the hardmodes %s are not new, it's the same as pre-WotLK. There shouldn't be ANY middle ground, or it's easy or it's hard. The challenge is on doing the hardmode, not on killing on &quot;not-so-hard&quot;-mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A bunch of clearly dedicated and hardcore raiders (why else would they be on the ptr) have defeated the first boss in its 10 man form whilst massively outgearing it and people are alrdy whining &quot;LOL WORLD OF EASYCRAFT&quot; etc. You fucking mindless morons.<br />
<br />
When you go in and 1 shot Arthas on 25 man hard mode I'll be impressed.<br />
<br />
If not - fuck off. You're all boring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your guild have cleared ToC25 several times, meaning you at least have around 10 in 245 gear. Meaning you now are equal to ToC10 heroic gear wise.<br />
<br />
A 10man guild (as the one you quoted) will have around 232 gear and some few 245 from pugs or Emblems.<br />
<br />
Content tends to be easy when you are in better gear then intended for the specific content. You gonna whine that VH HC is to easy as well in 245 gear?<br />
<br />
<br />
I wasn't even referring to ToC10 HM as a specific example, just speaking in generalities. Assuming you know what the hell you're doing, you'll always be squeezing the most DPS out of your current gear. At that point, and as you said, it's a gear and DPS check, not a difficulty check. It's as doable in 232 gear as it is in 245 gear. A group in 245+ will simply clear it faster, but it doesn't make it hard. All the ones prior to Anub were easy even without much gear. Anub isn't about diffculty, it's about a DPS check, and not making mistakes.<br />
<br />
You can't say an encounter is harder because it requires X level of gear. All that means is it has a DPS requirement. DPS requirements aren't difficult to meet, and are restricted by your gear, not how difficult somethign is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
On the flip side of that, overgearing an encounter with DPS/healers/tanks DOES make it easier. Unlike your feeble attempt to gloss over the truth, overgearing a raid (f.ex. ToC10HM with Uld25 (heroic) HM or even ToC25 gear) does NOT only make the encounters faster but EASIER too. To make it simple for you to grasp, here is a list of points to think about:<br />
<br />
The faster that DPS can burn a boss/add the less of a threat that boss/add has on the group, meaning fewer OMFG AVOID THAT SHIT abilities or phases to worry about.<br />
The more effective a single healers heals are the easier the encounter becomes: less mana needed because now each X# heals do the same work as previously X#-3 (example only) did. Additionally, the better the healers can cope with an encounter the less DPS needs to worry about avoiding certain DMG (f.ex. meh i have so much HP and healers are anyways overhealing me, so ill just eat that fire this time and continue DPSing). Also, the better the healers the fewer you need, allowing for more dps (see previous point for the impact of this). Finally, the better geared the healers the lower the probability the tank will die = lower the chance of a wipe = easier the run. <br />
The better a tank can survive directly proportionately affects the ease of the encounter. Why? because a) fewer heals are needed in general for the same effect (see previous point), b) less chance of a wipe, and c) the affordability of cheesing certain fight mechanics (1 tank take all adds and just tank instead of dps needing to dps them down or instead of needing 2 tanks, etc.) <br />
<br />
<br />
Now i'm sure there are a LOT more aspects of these points to elaborate upon but I assume you have enough intelligence to get the jist of the matter by now. Given this, it truly irks me to read overgeared fuckwads claiming overgeared encounters are too easy because they cheesed it. When people come here proving how they facerolled unovergearable hard mode encounters (atm that is 25man hardmodes) or even when they show how they facerolled normal encounters with lower gear and on their first attempt of the encounter, is when i'll start taking them seriously about the game being too easy. Till then they can continue to spew their frustrations in life through these forums and provide cheap entertainment for the more highly developed members of this community.<br />

<br />
This is a fairly good summary of my feelings, and I don't even really raid much. I get annoyed when someone like you Valtiel make stupid comments such as the ones in this thread so far. Seriously, are you that stupid that you suggest being geared in 25 man hard mode gear makes 10 man content too easy that it's like a &quot;glorified 5 man&quot;? Seriously?? Seriously?? Did you even think before you wrote that? Of course it makes it easy, you have gear 2 tiers above what you are supposed to be running it at. ToC 10 hard modes are meant to be run in a mix of 226/232 gear and doing it in 245+ does not make it easy nor make you cool and totally invalidates your opinion (and any other moron that says the same thing, which is 99% of the complainers here).<br />
<br />
I have to agree with Tauror too. VERY few people have asked for middle ground, and tbh I still haven't seen a good argument to make any middle ground yet. The people that cry content is easy are overgearing normal modes, plow through it, and then wipe on hard modes and complain those are too hard. So all you prove is that your gear is enough to carry you when content is overgeared but don't have the skill to do fights that actually require skill/work etc. I would like to see Blizz do away with 25 man content, or prevent you from entering 10 man content with 25 man gear. Then tell us about how easy the 10 man stuff is. Is it still easy? Possibly, but not to the extent you elitists make it out to seem.<br />
<br />
You are the ones that feel it is 100% needed to run the same content 4 times in a row for emblems, and then complain about running the same content over and over and how it is boring. It's your choice how to play, so if doing all the 10s is boring and easy, don't do it. They aren't there for you to farm, they are there for people in smaller guilds.<br />
<br />
Just like in vanilla and tbc, there is a very small % that clear the hard, hard modes, as only a small % ever saw naxx or cleared swp. Normal modes are for ... wait for it ... NORMAL people to see the content. You have your &quot;old wow&quot; and &quot;difficult to clear content&quot; in the hard modes. The next person that says the game is too easy better have every single hard mode achievement done in it's current tier of gear or else they can stfu up and stop complaining that the game is too easy. Because if you don't have it all cleared then it is NOT too easy for you and you are wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
I say nerf this one.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see superbad players clearing Icecrown and killing Arthas too, because I heard they exist and pay the same price for admission as good players!<br />
<br />
I like the sarcasm :). I don't think it needs a nerf but otherwise I totally agree. Just say I totally suck ok? SO WHAT? Does that make my $15 any less valuable than yours? Not a chance. Considering there are more people that &quot;suck&quot; since only &quot;3%&quot; of people have cleared all current content I dare say it makes my/our $15 more valuable since there is a hell of a lot more of us (at least more valuable to Blizz). Just because I suck doesn't mean I'm not allowed to clear normal content, in fact the total opposite. Blizz has said they want me to clear it (or at least get into and see most of it).<br />
<br />
Not to mention it's a PTR and a &quot;living&quot; game. Things change all the time. Expect it, and learn to deal with it. It's going to happen. If you don't like it, find another game, another forum and do something you like instead of complain about something you don't like that the majority of us DO actually enjoy.</div></div><hr />

Normal modes should NOT exist at all. We should ONLY have hard modes.<br />
<br />
The bit where you said the game is too easy and crap compared to vanilla WoW is the part i agree with you the most ;D<br />
<br />
<br />
Look buddy, even though you and I are obviously the people that have enough time on our hands to work on getting the best gear and do the good raids, it doesn't mean that everyone else does. I play the game waaaaaay too much due to unrelated personal problems in my life. I number crunch on my gear and agonize on switching pieces out even if it only means a 20dps increase, things like that.<br />
<br />
However, I would say that most of the WoW player base is made of people who actually have lives and may not have the time to do everything perfectly and beat the hard modes. Hard modes are there for people who have the time to dedicate. But there are people who just want to relax and play the game, and not have to analyze everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only differences between then and now is:<br />
<br />
Now your raid isn't filled with 20 members who are incredibly useless and who can die without having any impact on the encounter you're facing.<br />
<br />
You're no longer a paladin healing with http://www.wowhead.com/?item=19375 and http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22713 and your gear no longer has every single statistic on it. <br />
<br />
You no longer have to farm green Nature resist gear to be able to stand in a cloud of poison to die before the useful members of your raid get murdered by an enraged huhuran.<br />
<br />
Viscidus wasn't very much fun without a poison cleansing totem, as much fun as it was stacking 8 druids and 8 paladins in a raid specifically to remove poison.<br />
<br />
Your materials come from readily available gold from questing that you can get from anywhere, instead of murdering animals in the blasted lands for hours a day to get buffs that are removed when you die.<br />
<br />
You don't come home from work and put your hand through a wall because people are too stupid to figure out the mechanics of Twin Emperors and you want to kill C'thun tonight, but you know that the aforementioned 20 stupid people will just blow eachother up because they're not standing in the correct 8 yard spread apart hexagon that's required for absolute perfection anyways.<br />
<br />
Who is defining old school raiding anyways? You liked having to buff players with 5 minute blessings? The fact that no one, even you, knew what your gear was, or should be made into? That no one knew the boss encounters and thus you got to spend 4 hours a night wiping to Garr because half of your raid wasn't smart enough to look at a debuff? The fact you want to punch your hunters in the face because they can't equip their stupid bows before a Nefarian call? Manually checking each player to see if they have a flask, potion, blasted lands buff, onyxia/blahblahblah before an encounter starts? <br />
<br />
Get it through your heads. Most old encounters were NOT fun. Things started to get fun with the original, 40man naxx. SSC was ok, TK was fun, Black Temple was definately fun, and Sunwell took the cake. <br />
<br />
MC was neverending, searing badness, BWL was horrible except for possibly Nefarian, AQ40 started to be fun but withered into an ugly, twisted thing at Huhuran, then died horribly at C'thun.<br />
<br />
Maybe people have fond memories of things that never really existed, but most people today still aren't even competent enough to do this content on normal, let alone hard modes.</div></div><hr />

You know, downloading an addon that makes sure you're 8 yards apart from other people, forming 8 pentagons in a crowded room and praying that the other idiots don't accidently blow you up. <br />
<br />
Or the enjoyable factor of Huhuran, where you got to have people wearing useless gear and trinkets from Maraudon in hopes of lasting an extra 2 seconds during her enrage before everyone else blows up and dies.<br />
<br />
I guess I also forgot how much fun doing Shazzrah was with 40 people, 1/2 of which are mindless idiots that blow other people up. Or Garr, that was an awesome fight, you never know who might be set up the bomb. Wait, how about Majordomo? That was an awesome fight when the only tank were warriors and there were no AoE threat mechanics.<br />
<br />
Man, I guess I also forgot about Chromaggus, in which you get to save up sand from other shit in the instance in order not to get frozen randomly and wipe the raid. What a cool mechanic, if you don't have people dispelling 40 people nonstop, you lose, wooie, lots of fun.<br />
<br />
It's nice that you can just say &quot;LOL UR GUILD MUSTA SUCKED&quot; but what fun mechanics can you possibly point out for old world raiding? <br />
<br />
Nefarian was neat. 4 Horsemen was neat. Kil'jaeden was neat. That's it.</div></div><hr />

The content is so easy we dont have to raid that much because after a day or 2 everything its cleared it doesnt take long to do normal toc 10 or 25 man. It can be cleared in 25mins each. People that want to see the content need to join guilds that dont have 5years olds playing the game and join one that have people that have half of a brain and can move out of stuff.

Q u o t e:<br />
Any Reason? Is it just an annoyance? It isn't gonna kill anyone in combat while raid healers are around. So just don't AFK for 5 minutes 3 seconds? Sunwell Radiance was there for a reason, whether we liked it or not. This I am not sure.<br />
