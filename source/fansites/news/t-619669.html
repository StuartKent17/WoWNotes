I don't mind nerfing class like that but where is compensation? Like snare, interrupt or intercept like ability?<br />

Yup, only thing, except 12 second complete immunity to damage, instant heal for whole health and the longest duration stun in game :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: oh, sorry, I forgot plate and Pursuit of Justice, of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't care about PvP, what's wrong with your burst being gone? You'll still do the same DPS according to blizzard, just not OVER 9000 in less than 2 seconds.</div></div><hr />

it's only counterable if you're bad. You're not bad are you?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megiddo</div><div class="date">2008-10-19, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm being completely objective here. I don't have that much of resilience gear on my mage (around 250-300). However the paladin burst is just too high. You are pretty much dead if they get close to you. Also hunters tend to do some nice burst damage along with deep arcane mages spamming their Arcane Barrage annoyingly =). <br />
<br />
BUT, keep in mind that the talents are set for lvl80 and they will naturally get tuned down a bit. In addition, I don't see anything natural with Ret. Paladins not only because of their imbalanced burst damage, but also their ice block that don't keep them grounded with infinite mana that can be used to 'often critically' heal themselves. (that is because spell crit = melee crit now).<br />
<br />
They need to be tuned down. Period.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">canopener25</div><div class="date">2008-10-20, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, I have a 70 tier 5 mage spec icy veins/ deep fire and own ret pally's in bg. Obviously a mage isn't for up close and personal fighting, which is the only reason a mage should get owned by a pally. Average crits of 3-4k, by the time a pally realizes what is happening he's dead. In my own oppinion mage's really need to get nerfed, cause all the time i get fireball,fireblast and every 7/10 times get an instant pyroblast for about 4k. I'm actually happy to see ret pally's have nice damage, cause when you raid at 70- if your not a tank or a healer pally, you don't usually get to go till now. So i say go pallys.................</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Henrod</div><div class="date">2008-10-20, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First i would like to start out with it saddens me to see so much QQ about Ret dps. when the new talents came out it was based on lvl 80 toons. It just so happens that Ret pallys benifited more from these talents at lvl 70 then most other classes (all tho Mages and Warlocks came in close 2nd). when pvp takes place at lvl 80 people will see that the Ret dps isnt that far off since on average your HP will double on every toon. and if you havent played a Ret pally at lvl 70 you dont know that we rely on our CD's alot to be so bursty. In addition Ret pallys have no MS or wound poison that helps them finish off there target when they have a healer tending to them, which will be evident at lvl 80 when healers get OP again.(trust me it will happen) In short at lvl 80 with double the HP most classes wont complain about a Ret paladins dps. Ok but it happend anyway and the masses cryed out to blizz in full force and blizz bowed down, so divine storm takes a big hit&lt;-(huge deal) and then they reduce the repent.&lt;- (not that big of a deal). <br />
<br />
What im suggesting is a change to divine storms ability to keep our dps numbers down as too many have spoken out against it. It would be a waste of time to talk sense into so many and tell them to be calm untill lvl 80 then check the balance of the game. So what i would like to see happen to give Ret a boost which they need to hold those pve dps spots and still be stable in pvp with out to much QQ is that they keep the dps nerfed as they did but add a melee / casting speed debuff to it. so that when we do use our new 51 point talent, it will still shine in pve and pvp with out so many people crying about the burst dps. I also think that many pallys that play Ret and are looking forward to pveing would say this would help tip the scales in our favor a bit more to get a raid spot. <br />
<br />
Also if this fails to appeal to people i would like to suggest maybe keeping the nerfed dps on divine storm, but giving it a purge ability to consume a HoT or buff. either one of these suggestions would make Ret pallys needed more in PvE and still keep other classes happy with the nerf in our dps.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Henrod</div><div class="date">2008-10-20, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ya i think we all share that fear of /whisper ******** what spec are you?......Ret..... /reply LOL nvm need prot or heals if you want in this raid. thanks anyway.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vertue</div><div class="date">2008-10-20, 03:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a person who has played a pally and several other clases for 3 years now I agree that the new talents were great (especuly for ret) and that some of them needed to be balenced. I just hope that ret doesent go back to being a joke and remains a viable spec for pve and pvp. Anyonce who has played pre patch 3.0 knows how bad ret pallies had it, It was near imposible for them to do arena successfully not to mention there was almost no reason to bring them to raids/dungeons because the buffs and utility they proivided often wasent enough of a reason to bring them insted of a pure dps class.<br />
<br />
<br />
Too late... nerf already going live. Check Beta realms, Ret back to lol state already. We barely doing 3k dmg with DS (and so far with one of the best dps gears at level 80, 3.4k is the maximum recorded so far). Mages/Rogues even enh shammies doing like 6 - 9k burst easily. You want to play your pally, once again it's tank it, heal it or beat it... :(<br />
Already on betas people are dumping their pallies all over again... Welcome to the return of tbc.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BenBMW</div><div class="date">2008-10-20, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pallies get no sympathy from me. You complain about only being able to tank or heal, pre-patch? So what! You're amazing tanks, healers, and DPS right now. To me, that's just a load of crap. You shouldn't be able to be so good at all 3 roles as a hybrid class. I hope you get some sub-par form, lol. You're suppose to be a jack of all trades, master of none. I think Paladins are a much better Hybrid class then they should be right now. That's just my opinion though. I think each class should only have an option between 2 of the 3 roles. It's kinda unfair that you can just respec and regear to any role you want, when others can't. However, everyone already knew this before making their own character's so yeah... To each their own. :)<br />
<br />
I'm happy with my Warrior Tank, but sometimes I get jealous of pallies be good at all 3 roles. Warriors tanks aren't exactly much better single target tanks anymore either. Pallies can almost gain threat faster then a warrior can, and they pretty much have infinite mana (depending on boss). They're still far superior in AoE tanking, by both damage and simplicity. Damnit! I shall stop now, before I become jealous again...</div></div><hr />
