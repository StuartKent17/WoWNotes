<br />
Are they nerfs, though? There is this one rather large and important bit:<br />
<br />
Enhancement Shaman: Decreases damage/healing by 43%: Crash Lightning, Crashing Storm, Earthen Spike, Earthquake, Elemental Spirits, Feral Lunge, Flametongue, Flametongue Attack, Frostbrand, Fury of Air, Hailstorm, Lava Lash, Lightning Bolt, Lightning Shield, Rockbiter, Searing Assault, Stormstrike, Stormstrike Off-Hand, Sundering, Windfury, Windfury Attack, Windstrike, Windstrike Off-Hand Decreases periodic damage/healing by 43%: Crash Lightning, Crashing Storm, Earthen Spike, Earthquake, Elemental Spirits, Feral Lunge, Flametongue, Flametongue Attack, Frostbrand, Fury of Air, Hailstorm, Lava Lash, Lightning Bolt, Lightning Shield, Rockbiter, Searing Assault, Stormstrike, Stormstrike Off-Hand, Sundering, Windfury, Windfury Attack, Windstrike, Windstrike Off-Hand Increases damage/healing by 100%: Earth Shield Shaman - Enhancement Spec. Shaman - Enhancement Spec.<br />
<br />
Notice how it used to be decreases damage by 43%. Now, it reads increases damage by 100%. I have no idea what these changes are supposed to be, but I wouldn't jump to conclusions just yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and there is also this bit, from a blue post, regarding Enhancement Shaman.<br />
<br />
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769719552<br />
<br />
&quot;In addition to these changes above, we’re adjusting how many tooltips are generated. This may cause some websites to show that the damage or healing of almost every single Enhancement ability has changed. Do not panic; we are not lowering all of your damage and healing! This will be a behind-the-scenes data adjustment only.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I'd imagine he does.<br />
<br />
But that's how Enhancement is right now. You go from resource starvation to having so much you just simply can't get rid of it.<br />
<br />
One of the PTR changes is removal of Lightning Shields Maelstrom generation, so we might be a bit better as far as generating too much goes. Now, if we can get something to not make us starve from the lack of procs, we'd be in a decent place, as far as resource generation goes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, remember blues post regarding tooltip generation for shammies, that they did background changes that might display wrong values to dataminers so what we read doesnt mean that is necesarry true untill tested and confirmed <br />
<br />
By the looking at those tooltips as they are now, they have removed MINUS 43% aura which is, by it self, a buff of 43% right there across the board.<br />
Next, if you look broadly it looks like they are moving some damage from passives and spenders to generators.<br />
Im not quite happy with buffs to Boulderfist and Landslide because those two are not the most interesting talents to play with, more like set and forget. With nerf to lShield this might make them dominent in their rows.<br />
<br />
...dunno.. i have expected some kind of minor rework, not full spec rework, just something that will change just a bit our core &quot;rotation&quot;..<br />
<br />
By the looks of it, despite all these changes enhance still has same problems with talents/survivability. This just makes enhances damage more consistent and no procs chain less punishive. And our heal heals for 43% more.</div></div><hr />

Demo has already gotten considerable buffs so far and the sacrifice souls nerf was such that the other 2 talents will be in line with it since they've reworked how they function. Learn to balance before you complain.</div></div><hr />

If Blizzard can not balance a MMO game for all classes in beta... then the company needs to fire those that are responsible class balance of the game. It's that simple.

<br />
Blizzard fear the backlash they may receive if DK's are a tier 1 class. Even when Frost was super strong in legion, they weren't THE most op class in the game, certainly not as op as assas rogues currently are. Since the hero class came into lich king, DK's were so broken that pissed off many people that forced blizzard's hand to consistently change the class. Now, they tread with caution, leaning towards just making it playable rather than a proper class that can play with many comps. Looking at frost, DK's are the only class that receive *buffs* with a condition, WE'RE MAKING REMORSELESS WINTER DO THIS, BUT REDUCE ITS RANGE AND ALSO INCREASE ITS COOLDOWN BY 25 SECONDS!!! YOU WANT TO SURVIVE LONGER? TAKE LICHBORNE, ONLY 1 MINUTE COOLDOWN! (but you can't move during that time) Dont get me wrong, unholy does fairly well against wizard comps, but they just get steam rolled vs most other comps. Frost however, yeah... Just switch to a different class til another big patch hits (it certainly wont be 8.1) The 3s ladder is enough proof what a sorry state the class is in (However, warlocks are doing worse) <br />
<br />
All in all, Blizzards approach to (lets spend the whole season trying to keep nerfing the brokenly op class in hopes that DK's and warlocks will become viable) has failed miserably. Dk's somewhat caught up, locks on the other hand... I'm so sorry if you main one. you can't even play the game most of the time in high rated 3s.</div></div><hr />
