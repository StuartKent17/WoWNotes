<br />
It looks like the zone will be instanced at some point, and available as a &quot;Scenario&quot;. I couldn't find anything else on &quot;scenario&quot; in the game files but it's very unusual to have an additional information such as this one in the name of the Map. The only exception is &quot;Transport:&quot; maps and we could potentially be looking at a new type of instance here. <br />
<br />
The &quot;Expansion&quot; field of the Map.dbc is set to &quot;3&quot; and seems to point to Cataclysm content but there's also the slight possibility that it's early data from the next expansion that got mislabeled. <br />

Firelands / Molten Front Daily Quests - Progression Breakdown<br />
A few days ago, Spl4sh3r posted a fairly useful list on the forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/929938-25-Marks-a-day-right?p=12073453#post12073453) to try to explain how much time it will take you to unlock the different phases of the Firelands / Molten Front Daily Quests. <br />
<br />
Phases Description<br />
Phase 1 - Beginning<br />
Phase 2 - Molten Front<br />
Phase 3 - Choose between Druids of the Talon and Shadow Wardens<br />
Phase 4 - Choosing the other option from Phase 3<br />
Phase 5 - Choosing &quot;Additional Armaments&quot; (See Firelands Daily Quests Rewards (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2320-Patch-4.2-Firelands-Dailies-Marks-of-the-World-Trees-Rewards-MMO-Report-Comics))<br />
Phase 6 - Choosing &quot;Filling the Moonwell&quot; (See Firelands Daily Quests Rewards (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2320-Patch-4.2-Firelands-Dailies-Marks-of-the-World-Trees-Rewards-MMO-Report-Comics))<br />

Reminder - RaidComp up to date for Patch 4.2!<br />
There wasn't any major change to raiding mechanics in 4.2, which means that RaidComp (http://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com/) still works for Patch 4.2! Check it out if you're wondering how to optimize your raid composition!<br />

Firelands Raid Trash - Who wants to be a millionaire?<br />
This video from Mione (http://blog.mionelol.net/) shows why Blizzard had to hotfix the trash of the Firelands raid instance earlier this week. <br />

<br />
I tested it myself yesterday on my Druid. He just started it yesterday, getting the exact Mark totals above.<br />
<br />
So the table there is only accurate for people who have started on Day 1, and are consistent in doing them every day (and who didn't abuse the Daily Reset bug when it happened).</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but it's always just been there with no real purpose. No quests. Just as bunch of high lvl elites and a gnome you can't solo. The point is that there seem to be new files and it's being dubbed a scenario. Which indicates it will serve some actual purpose in the future.<br />

Yes just because something has been in the game, doesn't mean that they can't add to it or change it right?<br />

Boub is pointing out that these files are just showing up, meaning that there is some sort of change happening to it. &quot;Scenario&quot; was never listed in the gamefile before.</div></div><hr />

With one graveyard pretty unlikely.<br />
<br />
Also the island was quite small. Well then, I'd tell it's more likely something quite new, because they could've done quests or events there using just masked mobs.<br />
Seeing there Scenario, it could've been for machinima staff, but then it wouldn't make much sense to be left in client, and still could be easily shot in live island.<br />
<br />
It might likely just be small instance, similar to what we've saw during shattering, as AI was never instanced, unlike places that the event took part in, it could be why.<br />
I do not think they'd add brand new stuff in the middle of the expansion, however seeing how cataclysm was not complete success ...</div></div><hr />

That's the thing though, unless its a hidden change, they only nerfed the droprate on the unbound blazing elementals and spiderlings. So the thing shown in the video is still possible as far as I know, dunno for how long now though since its frontpage news =P</div></div><hr />

Not entirely true, you visited it once in the dungeon tier 0,5 questline and once more for Dr Weavil. It also still has nagas who drop some blacksmithing plans, but they're pretty useless.</div></div><hr />

Some might think items should not be obtained from trash, but otherwise do not complaint of droprates. Everyone can see they got it from trashruns instead of raiding. Just don't make it boe so people think they need to squeeze others out of 60k gold, which is about 3000 daily's... <br />
<br />
Imo they should lower goldcap and use max amounts on ah, because prices are going crazy, and everywhere ninja's are being born because of the amount of gold they can make, and goldsellers are laughing in their hands. Would be nice if noone could have more than 5k gold and people would start share stuff again instead of trying to become rich on the back of others, but that's just me. Make craftables easier to obtain and for less mats, but itemlevel always like 5 levels lower than boss drops so those still keep their value etc. I don't mind a grind for a special item , i did griond 2 years for thunderfury myself, but the prices on ah are just getting insane, and imo that should be stopped instead of people who are happy they got an epic after spending an evening in firelands. If some classes can solo stuff , than you should better look into those classes and see what you did wrong that they can solo a big pile of highlevel creatures.</div></div><hr />

Alcaz Island has been in the game forever and there were multiple quests that sent you there in Vanilla, but a dungeon labeled as Alcaz Island has only been in the game files since 4.1 and this Scenario thing is new with 4.2.<br />

be hearing from any of the old or neglected human nations in Cata, specifically Stromgarde, Kul'tiras, and the remnants of Alterac (hey, Deathwing paraded around as an Alterac noble before)? <br />
A: With the revamp of the classic World of Warcraft zones, players will get a chance to see how the fallen nations of Stromgarde and Alterac have fared over the last few years. Kul Tiras, the island nation, will not be visible at the start of Cataclysm – something about tectonic plates shifting it out to sea....</div></div><hr />

I hate to be the spork in your spoke, but something burning can't be rusting, as you need oxygen to oxidize metal, and fire uses oxygen to burn the last time I checked, sir. Also, sporks are usually plastic so you have about a 5 second window to stab before your weapon melts.</div></div><hr />

This post just confused me even more. On my Mage, it took 3 days, starting from 4.2 launch. I had already done all of the necessary Hyjal quests well in advance. My friend's Paladin took the same amount of time, also having already completed the quests.<br />
However, my Warrior alt did not have all of Hyjal done (I actually was only like 10 quests away). So, after doing those quests, I did the whole beginning part of the Molten Front stuff (not inside the Front yet, though) 2 days ago. I had to wait until today to be able to enter. So it took 3 days, just like my Mage. No difference there.<br />
The &quot;Huh?&quot; moment comes from my friend. On his Death Knight, he had already completed Hyjal quests. Yesterday, he came with me to do the pre-Front Hyjal dailies, and in one fell swoop, he received all 20 marks within one day - his first time doing the dailies on that character. There was also someone else in my guild who only needed to do one day's worth of the pre-Front dailies to get in as well. What the hell? What's going on? Was there some sort of cut-off for the whole &quot;wait 3 days&quot; thing, and now it only takes one day?<br />

do you remember that dungeon thing on the left side of Karazhan?<br />
the one where you couldn't enter because of the gate, but you could die there, run back and res on the other side of the gate.<br />
it was a huge empty space underground with gates inside and graves, water etc. they never did anything with that :(<br />

1 10k to 100k BoE, and about 50 gold, for 10 minutes work. <br />
<br />
still, if you have to, both you and your raid sub could ride back to the entrance and reset, then do it again. for 100k BoE's, it's the easiest and most ridiculous farming since the battered hilt and those exponentially higher droprates on day 1 (likely tuned for PTR). sure, it broke the AH for a while and led to some of the more ridiculous PUGs asking people to farm the trash in PoS for 3 to 4 hours, and, that first week, people did it. <br />
<br />

<br />
It's not &quot;hardcore&quot; to complete all of the dailies in there per day. There's only like, what, 6-8 dailies? Not much difference from Tol Barad/Peninsula stuff.<br />
<br />
it should be ~12, 16, 25 (due to refund of marks to P1-&gt; P2), 39, 53, 67 after 6 days. people who were lucky (perhaps dailies resets from rolling restarts, sic, etc., /shrug) got an extra 4 marks in some places due to an extra hyjal daily. <br />
<br />
compared to TB, this is easier, better gear arguably (FL trinkets are only good for stats) and it all should unlock at the same time for thousands of people, including the crafted gear which will drop from ~60k to 10k in like 3 days. <br />
<br />
it's on par with Argent Tournament's 30+ days of vehicle torture, but, instead of aspirant, valiant, champion coupons, you need roughly 700 marks in total, instead of 3+ weeks to reach champion and 100~1000 champion coupons to buy the pets, BoA, and all the achievement gear (Pony, Page, tabard, etc.). <br />
<br />
and in the end, it's probably around 300 dailies... to add to all the others you &quot;have&quot; to do on all the alts you'll ever roll. <br />
<br />
and if you do have alts, phase 3, is 14 dailies, for 25 marks.<br />
just reiterating that, 14x3 minutes dailies, is going to be ... grindy.<br />
<br />
i.e. this is from duwg on the wowhead site ... so far it tracks. <br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 1 <br />
Day 1 = 8 Marks from One-Time Quests , 4 Marks from 3 Dailies<br />
Day 2 = 4 Marks from 3 Dailies<br />
Day 3 = 4 Marks from 3 Dailies, Turn-in 20 Marks for <br />
<br />
Phase 2<br />
Day 3 = 15 Marks from One-Time Quest , 10 Marks from 5 Dailies<br />
Day 4 = 14 Marks from 8 Dailies, <br />
...<br />
Day 12 = 14 Marks from 8 Dailies, total of 151 Marks, Turn-in 150 Marks to Druids of the Talon for <br />
<br />
Phase 3 <br />
Day 12 = 5 Marks from One-Time Quest, 11 Marks from 6 Dailies <br />
Day 13 = 25 Marks from 14 Dailies, <br />
... <br />
Day 18 = 25 Marks from 14 Dailies, total of 167 Mark, Turn-in 150 marks to Shadow Wardens unlock Wares NPC, <br />
3 NPC to unlock for 125 Mark each. <br />
<br />
Day 19 = 25 Marks from 14 Dailies, <br />
... <br />
Day 23 = 25 Marks from 14 Dailies, total of 142 Mark , Turn-in 125 mark to NPC <br />
...<br />
Day 28 = 25 Marks from 14 Dailies, total of 142 Mark, Turn-in 125 mark to NPC <br />
...<br />
Day 33 = 25 Marks from 14 Dailies, total of 142 Mark, Turn-in 125 mark to NPC <br />
<br />
So total time to get everything is 33 days.<br />

<br />
I had exactly the same experience. It took me 3 days for my warrior and druid to get into the molten front. But when I'm on my DK and hunter, I got on the first day. <br />
<br />
All the 4 chars had finished all hyjal quests before and had exactly the same starting status. I don't know why.</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit: oh well, that exactly what the guy in the first post said anyway<br />
<br />
It's the &quot;old content, who cares?&quot; taken to a new level...<br />
<br />
&quot;It's old phase 1, who cares!&quot;<br />
<br />
I guess we'll get that for phase 2 again... &quot;it's old phase 2, who cares!&quot;, ppl will be able to do Phase 1 and 2 in one day...<br />
<br />
Also, the timming is terrible for these dailies... makes no sense to open a front against ragnaros if he's alread dead... It would be correct if they released the molten front stuff like 1 month before opening the raid. Right now you're preparing an assault for something that was alread assault lol. It's like preparing an army to kill LK from the ToC chain while there is alread an army inside ICC killing LK.</div></div><hr />

Isn't it time people just admit they are broken to the core and needs a revamp like paladins. I mean, it's JUST like paladins: They are either too weak or horribly OP (allthough in cata palas have been more balanced ish on that part) Te only difference is paladins spend most their time being UP, and Dk's have yet to be UP, only slightly bad 1 seasons : /</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seanzee</div><div class="date">2011-07-27, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Several notes. I find it highly unlikely that Alcaz will be a BG. First of all, there is little reason for the two factions to fight over it. Second of all, the island is currently in the game already, and is not very big. If they were to convert it to a instanced scenario, they couldn't scale it much larger without things seeming rather un-realistic. So, the likelihood of it being a BG...is well, non-existent.<br />
If you do a little research, Alcaz is currently being held by the Naga, and it is apparent that they are guarding something. Now, I definitely believe this has to do with Cataclysm lore in some way. Remember, Queen Azshara has been a suspected plot line for cataclysm for some time. Not to mention with her appearances in Dark Shore quest lines. I'd assume that this might be closely related to her, and I suspect to see her as an antagonist in this expansion. <br />
Final note..This whole DK's are OP crap is pretty dumb. People complaining that they are always OP, and they were only bad for one season. Okay, well, play a little PVE first, and you'll realize that DK's are balanced very well in PVE. In fact, in all the rankings I've looked at, they are somewhere in the middle.<br />
The only reason DK's were able to solo FL trash, is because they are the only class with a reliable, efficient, AOE snare. It doesn't make them OP at all. It doesn't take a class being OP to kite a group of adds that you can easily keep snared.<br />
If they aren't balanced for PVP....welcome to WoW. They can't keep pvp and pve balanced. If they nerf them for pvp, then guess what? I might as well delete my DK. Then again, WoW is obviously all about Arena, right?</div></div><hr />

Alcaz island and Nexus, I do not know if this is a mistake or blizzards little hint about what is coming. If you press either of these dungeons at the moment the app crashes and must be relaunched...</div></div><hr />
