Tides of Vengeance<br />
<br />
The Horde and Alliance conflict may feel more distant right now, but that's all about to change.<br />
Tides of Vengeance is the next update! <br />
Coming to the PTR by the end of the week!<br />
<br />
<br />
New Content<br />
<br />
The War Campaign continues.<br />
Incursions are coming - Similar to Legion Assaults. Horde/Alliance forces will invade an area, turning off World Quests, and adding an objective for the area. <br />
New World Quests are coming.<br />
Saurfang, Tyrande, and Vol'jin story lines will be advanced. <br />
Heritage Armor is coming for other races: Dwarves and Blood Elves. It is unlocked via a racial quest, Exalted and Max Level? You can log in, do the quest, and unlock it!<br />
New Warfront - The Battle for Darkshore. Night Elves vs Forsaken. New Structures and Upgrades. Darkshore will have max level character content and zone updates.<br />
<br />
<br />
Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
Two New Island Expeditions - Jorundall (Vrykul) and Havenswood (Gilnean City)<br />
Island Expeditions will have new events and enemies, more variety, holdouts that can be triggered, and Azerite Extraction points that you'll have to depend.<br />
Island Expeditions will have major spawning improvements. Won't be uniformly blanketed by spawns. More clusters and hubs, more gaps, more navigability between hubs.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Raids<br />
<br />
Siege of Zuldazar<br />
<br />
Different than any raid before. <br />
The enemy is the opposite faction, with separate faction experiences. <br />
Alliance start at the docks and climb the pyramid, eventually fighting King Rastakhan. <br />
The Horde will defend the city, starting outside. They fight towards Rastakhan, which will be the middle of the raid for them. They then fight Alliance forces down towards harbor, ending with Jaina. <br />
After completing the faction specific experience, you'll be able to experience the other 3 faction bosses. <br />
There are a total of nine new boss encounters.<br />
<br />
Crucible of Storms<br />
<br />
This raid has two bosses and is located under Stormsong Valley, <br />
It will be released after Zuldazar.<br />
There will be supporting world content.<br />
<br />
<br />
System Improvements<br />
<br />
Class updates, new Azerite Traits, new profession recipes, Gnomeregan Pet Battle Dungeon, and more!<br />
Team has learned from the Azerite Traits, current ones are a base level, more complexity coming. <br />
Map and Reputation improvements coming. <br />
Champion of Azeroth faction will be effectively account wide. <br />
Reputation restricted transmog items will have restrictions removed. <br />
Progress towards the X Number of Exalted reputations achievements will be account wide.<br />
In the events following the raid, we should be able to recruit the Kul Tiran and Zandalari Allied Races. If you are Exalted with the Zandalari / Proudmoore and played through the War Campaign, that's enough, nothing additional to do.<br />
<br />

New Warfront - The Battle for Darkshore. Night Elves vs Forsaken. New Structures and Upgrades. Max Level Darkshore zone updates.<br />
<br />
Wy Darkshore though? Lets ignore the fact that there are many better places across Kalimdor for warfront, but:<br />
<br />
1). what are the forsaken even doing there still<br />
2). how the hell would the night elves get there<br />
3). werent they mostly wiped out?<br />
4). why would they fight for a burnt tree<br />

Pretty sure they chose Darkshore cause it already served as a max level content so it was in some way easier and faster to put the warfront in there.</div></div><hr />

Nine bosses should provide a lot of content. 2 boss raid... Maybe? Most of those haven't been that fun but who knows.<br />
<br />
As for the rest... It just feels like they're doubling down on existing (and not that interesting) stuff. I don't really want more invasions, world quests, island content or even another warfront. I want something fresh. And I'm still gobsmacked how long they're holding back the last 2 allied races. Were they really that unfinished by launch?</div></div><hr />

Wy Darkshore though? Lets ignore the fact that there are many better places across Kalimdor for warfront, but:<br />
<br />
1). what are the forsaken even doing there still<br />
2). how the hell would the night elves get there<br />
3). werent they mostly wiped out?<br />
4). why would they fight for a burnt tree<br />
<br />
Pretty sure they chose Darkshore cause it already served as a max level content so it was in some way easier and faster to put the warfront in there.<br />
<br />
Because kalimdor is their home that they have lived on for thousands of years? The tree is less than 20 years old. who cares. But kalimdor is their real true home that they would fight for.</div></div><hr />

I was hoping (futilely, I know) for flying in 8.1, even though I believe with Legion it wasn't until at least 7.2. But it's not a big deal - I'll just continue to focus on my main in 8.1 and maybe level an Alliance alt to 120 but hold off on leveling the rest (14+ characters lvl 100+) to 120 until after flying/heirlooms for 110+ are out.</div></div><hr />

Let's take out our 2nd grade mathbooks. 3 Faction specific bosses in a 9 boss dungeon. That's 3 + 9 = 12 bosses. Another raid with 2 bosses (this one builds up to 8.2 Azshara since it's in Shrine of Storms area) 12 + 2 = 14. 14 bosses. <br />
<br />
Also, because you probably don't understand how development goes or what is considered patch worthy, but updates to systems, another warfront, hertiage armor (art team says hello), pet battle dungeon, those &quot;few quests&quot; AND updated (and more) island expeditions. Yea, that's a &quot;minor patch&quot; alright.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rastakhan might though.<br />
<br />
Yeah, how Ion presents it is that the Alliance will have Rastakhan as the final boss, while the Horde fights Alliance champions including Jaina. So it's probably some other Alliance character(s) that bite it while Jaina retreats. <br />
<br />
I'm not certain I understand how revisiting the story works however. So initially, say you're Alliance, you do the raid, kill your three bosses and end with (I presume) killing Rastakhan. Then you go back to Boralus and do, what, the same bosses as Hordeside for completion's sake? Or three new bosses that are only there for the second part for both factions, so in the end effectively both factions have to fight six bosses total, three faction-specific and three shared?</div></div><hr />

They'll probably both get pros and cons. Jaina will be beaten back and taken down a peg, King Rastakhan will probably be killed. Either way, Zandalari will be enraged and want to join the Horde, Kul Tirans will think &quot;well we cant back out now&quot; and join the Alliance. I hope the other faction specific bosses are important lore wise so that we can end up killing Alliance figures (and Alliance can kill Horde figures).

No, King Rastakhan will pop shieldwall and summon his guards and do all sorts of throwing axe attacks. Again, you're a fucking retard if you think there will be anything different between the bosses<br />

I mean, that depends. If the six bosses that are faction specific don't have mirrored mechanics then they are technically completely different bosses. They probably will, but we don't know for sure yet.</div></div><hr />

We are each going to have 3 neutral bosses, then 3 faction specific bosses, then if we're horde, we talk to an NPC and turn into humans to fight the other bosses under the guise of him telling us what happened.</div></div><hr />

I agree it's too early to tell. But in defense of that person you quoted (who put it quite rudely), if the bosses do not have mirrored mechanics (even if different terminology for the abilities) then the raiding community will have to A. Consider only the non-faction specific bosses as part of the World First race or B. Have an Alliance World First and Horde World First race. Not that that would be a big problem, it would just be a change, that's all.</div></div><hr />

This is blatantly untrue if the mechanics are the same unless you actually count having different spell effects as different bosses. Which you shouldn't.

<br />
It comes across to me like a major instance of the Alliance finally being proactive in their battle against the Horde, rather than having every big move they make be a reaction to some atrocity of the Horde or another. Here's hoping the faction specific bosses do end up being unique from each other, although... I'm more interested, honestly, in the bosses that the two factions share. It raises the question of why and how these two perspectives end up meeting in the middle. Does a new challenger appear?<br />

I knew assaults would find their way back; it's pretty cool tech even if it gets stale rather quickly.<br />
Let's hope some variation comes with it, such as more than just &quot;pick 4 WQs that are easiest/fastest, then go kill a boss&quot;, but I have no idea what else it could be.<br />
On the bright side, those may make leveling alts faster, if the xp is anything like the Legion ones in comparison.</div></div><hr />

Watch the VOD again, please. Its 9 for each faction. Did you even watch dude? Those + 2 from small raid is 11 total, not 14.<br />

7.1 was a minor patch ;) He called 8.1 a major patch. Biggo difference there.<br />

7.1 was, quote, &quot;the first major update&quot; for Legion. 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 were major patches. 7.1.5, 7.2.5, and 7.3.5 were minor patches.</div></div><hr />

Alright, this is a good one! Very good start. I am happy I don't have to farm my old main through legion and bfa!<br />
<br />
<br />
Champion of Azeroth reputation will be effectively account wide. If you are already Revered, you can level an alt and go get your upgrades right away at Level 120.<br />
And in the same step I have to ask, why not make all account wide, simple as that...<br />
<br />
<br />
Reputation restricted transmog items will have restrictions removed.<br />
Or just make them account wide, wouldn't that be easier? What about recipes? I already farmed the rep, why do I have to do it on my alts (since you can only have two professions)? What if I am no goblin and don't want a gold sink :-)</div></div><hr />

Very regretable, but true tbh......<br />
<br />
<br />
All I want is them to lower the rep requirements for the Legion based Allied Races. Keep the requirement, just lower it to revered at least. It is such a slog trying to get exalted with Argussian and AotL if you missed it at the time.<br />

<br />
<br />
Tides of Vengeance<br />
The Horde and Alliance conflict may feel more distant right now, but that's all about to change.<br />
<br />
I'm in favour of fleshing out the conflict between Alliance vs Horde. I'm an old Warcraft player so I was missing the neverending conflict those factions have always had. All this teamwork they had got very boring and, even questionably, why even bother different factions if they are going to co-operate with everything?<br />
<br />
<br />
New Content<br />
The War Campaign continues.<br />
Incursions are coming - Similar to Legion Assaults. Horde/Alliance forces will invade an area, turning off World Quests, and adding an objective for the area.<br />
New World Quests are coming.<br />
New Warfront - The Battle for Darkshore. Night Elves vs Forsaken. New Structures and Upgrades. Darkshore will have max level character content and zone updates.<br />
<br />
War Campaign continues, I really hope it's lengthy. I've already started to forget what the last thing I did was. All this timegating the campaign makes it uninteresting for me.<br />
Incursions, depending on how they are done, but initally I feel &quot;meh&quot; about it. I wasn't that big fan of Legion Assaults, just felt like any WQ that didn't do any permanent change to the world.<br />
New World Quests? I'm geniunly curious if there's someone out there that are excited about more World Quests? I've hit revered with all factions and going Exalted with some, and even if they would add more for diversity I find no joy in them. <br />
New Warfront? The first one was really boring. There was no challenge, there was no depth to it. Regardless how poorly you would perform you would win eventually anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
None of those listed made me interested in farming more Island Expeditions. Again, it feels like there's no depth to it, everyone just does it for the weekly reward and then forgets it.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Raids<br />
Siege of Zuldazar<br />
Different than any raid before.<br />
<br />
Crucible of Storms<br />
This raid has two bosses and is located under Stormsong Valley,<br />
It will be released after Zuldazar.<br />
<br />
New raids is nice. I hope they add more challenge to them though. I'm fine with LFR being easy, but Normal and Heroic could be a tad harder.<br />
Crucible of Storms sounds like a new &quot;Gruul + Magtheridon&quot;. I hope the bosses are interesting at least.<br />
<br />
Now what I hope is that they really flesh out the loot tables. For example, Uldir has no 2H Axe whatsoever. Why exclude an item-type at all? That's just boring and lazy.<br />
<br />
<br />
System Improvements<br />
<br />
I want updates on Shaman class. I also hope for updates for other classes that also feel they are left behind.<br />
Azerite Traits, not interested. None so far (Resto Shaman) has felt really that interesting at all. The only trait I found slightly interesting was that Healing Stream Totem would do a mini-chain heal. Too many lackluster traits.<br />
Sure, they are going to remove a lot of traits and implament new ones, but considering that these traits made it through to final build and existed up to 8.1 has left me with no hopes of them actually knowing what good traits could be done.<br />
CoA Reputation being account wide I fully support to 100%. The CoA grind was fun the first 2-3 days. 3 weeks later it's not that fun anymore just to get higher ilvl on the neck.<br />
New Allied Races, that I will look forward to. I do hope there's a small quest chain to officially make them an Allied Race.<br />
<br />
So, in short, half the update that is interesating to look forward to, other half I'm just wondering who they are catering for, as me and many others are very uninterested in those features.</div></div><hr />

BUT I was fully expecting a new zone and the 2 last allied races... SOMETHING to outside, and I doubt a handful of new WQ for reps that I already maxed (exalted everywhere minus tortolan) will give us much to do.<br />
<br />
And if Arathi is to go by, Darkshore rework will offer VERY limited content.<br />
<br />
New campaign missions is good tho.<br />
<br />
So yeah... I don't know. It's better than I expected on some area, and worst on others. And since I stopped raided long ago, 8.1 won't offer me much to do.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciadia</div><div class="date">2018-09-18, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty lack luster update, not hyped for this it's neither here or there, it's what was to be expected raid wise.<br />
<br />
1 raid = to be expected for a 8.1 patch, nothing special<br />
1 raid announced for later = again not content dropping with 8.1 and just two bosses.<br />
<br />
War campaign = A few more quests, that isn't much.<br />
More warfronts = more of the same boring repeatable content, one of the &quot;special&quot; features of this exp<br />
- Wow alliance first, when everyone already got better gear than what's available in it, how generous of you, you messed warfront's up big time, this helps/offsets nothing.<br />
More islands = more of the same boring repeatable content, one of the &quot;special&quot; features of this exp, hardly anyone is doing them anymore<br />
More WQ = Who is really doing them anyone after getting exalted, i certainly am not.<br />
Incursions = trying hard to recreate the invasions that were popular (rightfully so) they were great for leveling, the same mechanic to just unlock a zone objective, no thanks<br />
Fixing 1 (yes one) achievement, so its now account wide, oh my god such content.<br />
<br />
How about actually bringing some content such as:<br />
- Unlocking the two new allied races (but nope that is AFTER the raids..)<br />
- Fixing the fact that alot of people are stuck with Sanguicell/Expulsoms/Hydrocores they can't use for anything<br />
- Actually make rep account wide, not just fixing an achievement, if not for all reps, then for current exp, why not let alts get items from quartermasters if your main has unlocked the rep.<br />
- Actually fix/balance the traits, you did 2, there is still 90% garbage choices, and you even nerfed the one from raid gear to the ground, way to obsolete your own content<br />
- Implement rep gains past exalted like legion, literally nothing to do in-game when you hit exalted, other than the 1-2 raid days, when you don't do mythics (boring content).<br />
- Giving us P2 for pathfinder to unlock flying<br />
- The list could go on and on on actual content they could have provided, this was more or less just an announcement of the raids we already knew were going to be present in the .1 patch, future prediction we will have a raid in .2 and .3 if they ever release!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">meroko</div><div class="date">2018-09-18, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably 8.2, 8.2.5, and a small hint of 8.3.<br />
<br />
8.1 is hitting PTR this week and should be live before Blizzcon. For reference, 7.1 was announced at Gamescom 2016 and 7.2~7.3 was announced at Blizzcon 2016.<br />
<br />
You are absolutely HIGH if you think 8.1 is going live any time this year, MAYBE December but HIGHLY unlikely. We've barely dipped foot in Uldir from an overall progression level.<br />
<br />
And I don't care what anyone says, a faction split raid is definitely new, even if it's 3 bosses. The way they made it sound they would be unique encounters depending on the faction. I'm very interested to see how this plays out, what will world firsts look like? To fit the narrative, the bosses have to be different, i mean we know alliance is fighting King Rast himself, so that's a huge difference from what Horde might encounter. Maybe our encounter is protecting him.<br />
<br />
I gots lots of questions, can't wait to see more info on PTR. Very cool idea, definitely trying something new.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you ever SEEN Twitch chat? It's literal cancer. Them paying even an ounce of attention to chat is ludicrous. I guarantee it was a constant flood of &quot;FIRE ION&quot; and &quot;LOOK AT ME BEING EDGY&quot; nonsense, along with a healthy dollop of 4chan idiots who think spamming the swastika is the height of comedy (they LOVE free live streams of anything, because reeeeeeeee). Any Twitch or Youtube chat stream that's more than a couple hundred people is pretty much useless and scrolls too fast to read, anyway.<br />
<br />
Ion keeps using the word &quot;discussion&quot;, when it's anything but that - but &quot;discussion&quot; is one of the current trendy words in media and politics, because it makes it sound like you have a voice (you don't), they're paying attention (they're not) and that something will happen that you have a say in (you don't). If someone in authority says &quot;discussion&quot;, it's going to be anything but that. <br />
<br />
The only change that's substantial is making that one rep account-wide. (Is it even that important? Not playing the game) The rest is:<br />
<br />
Players: &quot;We hate [things]. [Things] are broken. [Things] aren't fun. Please fix [things].&quot;<br />
Ion: &quot;Hey, look at new shiny [things]!&quot; <br />
<br />
They're committed. They're moving forward, as is, with &quot;tweaks&quot;. <br />

That's 3 + 9 = 12 bosses. Another raid with 2 bosses (this one builds up to 8.2 Azshara since it's in Shrine of Storms area) 12 + 2 = 14. 14 bosses. <br />
<br />
Also, because you probably don't understand how development goes or what is considered patch worthy, but updates to systems, another warfront, hertiage armor (art team says hello), pet battle dungeon, those &quot;few quests&quot; AND updated (and more) island expeditions. Yea, that's a &quot;minor patch&quot; alright.<br />
<br />
3 Faction specific bosses in a 9 boss dungeon would mean:<br />
<br />
1. There are 9 bosses in total<br />
2. Of those 9, 3 are faction specific.<br />
3. Which likely means 3 alliance, 3 horde, 3 neutral... 6 boss experiences depending on which experience you're participating in. And then a &quot;hey this is what happened with the other faction, to see the last 3 bosses).<br />

Shocking that they made older race heritage armor a quest instead of having to grind it out! :o<br />
<br />
You still have to be exalted with the home city of your race. Which is easily done by leveling.<br />
<br />
<br />
You mean the king that almost died...yup...but he will just be replaced by his daughter. And if you watched what ion said...the alliance gets pushed back to the harbor...aka they/we lose :S<br />
<br />
They go in, they kill Rastakahn, they make a tactical retreat with their mission proudly accomplished. Meanwhile, the Zandalari have to deal with a siege on their city AGAIN (Zul), they lose their king AGAIN (Rezan), and they will be horribly demoralized with grief and loss AGAIN. And to top it off, Jaina will get away meaning that the Zandalari won't even be able to avenge their fallen king?<br />
<br />
How the fuck is this a loss for the Alliance?<br />
<br />
<br />
Smoke and mirrors. Didn't address core issues of the expansion at all<br />
<br />
Yes, the patch that was planned out several months before the game's launch didn't address issues that arose after the game launched and only a few weeks before the patch is announced.<br />
<br />
Did you honestly think it would? These patches are planned out so far in advance that they can't really make changes to them quickly. Expecting changes this quickly is, quite frankly, unfair to the team. If they haven't addressed the issues by the next big patch, THEN you're justified to criticize the pace because they'll have had over half a year to fix the problems.<br />

If it hits PTR this week it will likely get released this year. If the raid/raids will be playable this year is the real question. Like in legion the patch going in does not mean the raid stuff appears day one.<br />

<br />

Yup I think the events of the raid basically cement the zandalari/kul tirans to your factions side so it is the logical point at which they become available as allies. By that time having all the requirements needed to unlock them should be easily done by anybody playing.</div></div><hr />

Erm, so no one is allowed to dislike the update they are doing? You go enjoy your Island Expedition and Warfront grind, that has no challenge to them. Enjoy the new WQs, those that has played since BFA launch has already reached their desired reputation that more WQs are not needed. Enjoy the new &quot;Invasion&quot; events that randomly occurs, that makes no permanent changes to the world, and is just a way more fancier World Quest amongst the other World Quests.<br />
<br />
Sure, there are some parts that e.g. I will enjoy from the patch, but I (and many others, probably majority) can relate that there are so many things in 8.1 patch that is uninteresting content, that Blizzard has devoted a lot of time into.<br />
<br />
PS; Just because people don't like something does not make them miserable. I can guarantee that there are things that you dislike, and with your logic that would make you a miserable being as well ;)</div></div><hr />

Sounds like Blizzard is pumping out content to keep people engaged. I see nothing desperate here.<br />
<br />
--<br />
On topic tho, no Azshara in 8.1 probably means she will be the end boss of this expansion. Being the Gul'dan of Legion most likely means she will survive the raid, unleashing N'zoth thus leading us into 9.0 where we will kill her in a scenario/dungeon/raid/whatever. At least this is my take on her.<br />
<br />
Bfa is shaping up to be even better than Legion IMO. :D Haters gonna hate</div></div><hr />

Long-term WOW fanboys are pointing out the weak points of this expansion and the obvious issues with the basic systems. None of those issues are addressed in this talk. And no mention how Blizzard is going to improve their reaction to player feedback when it comes to content on the PTR. Huge bugs slipped through the cracks all the way to live. That's not acceptable for anyone. Not for haters... and not for fanboys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know about desperate, but this all just sounds like they announced it earlier than they planned to. Everything announced was worked on for a significant amount of time (raids and content), the rest is just stuff that was coming anyway, they may move it up a couple of weeks. But that's what this was, a Twitch release announcement, not a &quot;what we're changing that we did wrong or not hard enough the first time&quot;. If this is patch 8.1, then it would have appeared on the PTR within the next couple of weeks anyway - nothing in here is a substantial change or redirection of what they already released. <br />
<br />
You know how they take a kid's picture by holding up a squeaky toy to distract them? That's what this was. &quot;Look, new shiny, that you'll get in two months - just ignore the lackluster and barren expansion we sold you for $60 that you have to hold your nose to endure until then!&quot; To me, it sounds like 8.1 or whatever this is numbered is the real release of BfA.<br />
<br />
The only thing even slightly interesting is the absence of Lore, not having him there to tell us what Ion really meant to say. (Which can be good or bad, depending on your perspective.)</div></div><hr />

Why are people so dismissive of the possibility that raid bosses can evolve and change over time? Just because someone is a raid boss does not, in fact, require them to die. It just means we're going to fight them. Surrendering, escaping, intervention from other characters, etc. All viable methods of ending a raid fight without killing the boss.<br />
<br />
Jaina is not going to die. Maybe at the end of the expansion, but not this early. Ergo, Jaina is going to get away.<br />
<br />
Also, Magni/Saurfang left in the ICC fight. So, yes. Raid bosses can leave without dying. ^_^</div></div><hr />

Horde players complain every single time something doesn't wildly favor them, you don't get to sack and burn our cities and kill our heroes too. Horde gets all of the good racial abilities, cooler looking armor, cooler looking mounts, more thought out and crafted storyline. Just completely obvious Blizzard bias towards the Horde that only the most blind can't actually see. Hell the best raiding guild in the world admitted the only reason they predominately play Horde is the racials. Yet anyone wearing red on the Horde side chalk it up to &quot;skill&quot;, lol. Alliance get to kill all of your Warchiefs and sack all of your cities. It is called balance. Perhaps the Horde shouldn't cry liquid edge over a trinket out of stun so hard next time, everyone is beyond feeling sorry for them and watching Blizz cave at this point.</div></div><hr />

It's entirely what the /focus/ of this expansion is about though. Maybe not the end goal (old gods), but we knew it was going to be Horde vs Alliance throughout.</div></div><hr />

But in defense of that person you quoted (who put it quite rudely), if the bosses do not have mirrored mechanics (even if different terminology for the abilities) then the raiding community will have to A. Consider only the non-faction specific bosses as part of the World First race or B. Have an Alliance World First and Horde World First race. Not that that would be a big problem, it would just be a change, that's all.<br />

After completing the faction specific experience, you'll be able to experience the other 3 faction bosses that you didn't get to experience firsthand.<br />
There are a total of nine new boss encounters.&quot;<br />
<br />
WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH THE WORDING????<br />
2 separate 6 boss experiences. So 6 different bosses for each faction?<br />
<br />
Could be 3 Horde-specific bosses, 3 Alliance-specific bosses, and 3 that are mechanically identical but reskinned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
blizz stop fucking with systems that work, right now raiding is the only thing most people log on for.<br />
<br />
Suggesting that &quot;most people&quot; do raid. <br />
<br />
Newsflash: Never been true, never will be. &quot;Most people&quot; login if they feel a reason to, saying that reason would be raiding when only a small fraction of the playerbase raid in an organized manner, is dishonest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New raid sounds kind of interesting. Change of pace for once at least.<br />
<br />
Heritage armor seems not ready to be released. Not sure why they are doing it if they only have 2 ready to go.<br />
<br />
I'd still like to see more done with warfronts to be more than participation events. New BG mode or something... Seems like a missed opportunity how they currently are.<br />
<br />
Indeed.<br />
<br />
Hoping they'll be making those changes once new Warfronts come out, perhaps in 8.1.5 or something like that?<br />

Well, it will be completable to characters already at 120, so my guess is yes, you should be able to boost them/earn it on already boosted toons?</div></div><hr />

Truth be told, those decisions were likely made, at minimum, 3 months ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
World quests have been in the game since TBC<br />
warfronts is a system people like to do, but are too rare, adding more will make them more common<br />
and islands are being fixed.. thats the point... adding alot more variety to make them more interesting.<br />

The only requirments are you are that race, and you have the rep max, then you do a quest line.<br />

and a majority of those who do, do lfr.</div></div><hr />

They said all you need is max level and exalted with Silvermoon and Ironforge. Not sure if that means having those achievements at the account level or on the character you want to unlock it with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. There are 9 bosses in total<br />
2. Of those 9, 3 are faction specific.<br />
3. Which likely means 3 alliance, 3 horde, 3 neutral... 6 boss experiences depending on which experience you're participating in. And then a &quot;hey this is what happened with the other faction, to see the last 3 bosses).<br />
<br />
At least with the wording you explained it as.<br />
<br />
Yea, I didn't get to watch the video so I commented as the post was still being updated. The way it listed it, it was taken as 6 neutral bosses with 3 faction bosses each.</div></div><hr />
