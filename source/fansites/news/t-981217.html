The Deathwing Raid: Interview with Scott Mercer [SPOILERS]<br />
In World of Warcraft content patch 4.3, players will make their ultimate stand against Deathwing the Destroyer. Almost a year has passed since the corrupted Dragon Aspect burst forth from the Maelstorm to bring the Cataclysm down upon the mortal races. Now the determined survivors from the Horde and Alliance have rallied to unleash vengeance of their own. <br />
<br />
To prepare for this earth-shattering battle, the Blizzard Insider recently discussed the upcoming Dragon Soul raid with Scott Mercer, lead encounter designer from the World of Warcraft team. Read on for all the epic details. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
CAUTION: THIS INTERVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER INFORMATION ON THE CATACLYSM STORY AND THE FINAL BATTLE AGAINST DEATHWING. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Blizzard Insider: Before we dive into the details, can you tell us about Deathwing’s character arc to date?<br />
<br />
Scott Mercer: Deathwing has changed the face of Azeroth probably more than any other villain in Warcraft’s history. He tore the Barrens in half. He caused tidal waves that transformed both continents. He even burned his claw marks into Stormwind Keep, leaving his personal signature on the Alliance capital. In many ways Deathwing embodies the Cataclysm itself, not just as the direct cause of it, but also as the thematic center of the expansion. His violent transformation from Earth-Warder to Destroyer ultimately led to all these changes across Azeroth, so in a very direct way, his character arc represents the force that set the entire expansion into motion.<br />
<br />
That said, we’ve been building towards a showdown with Deathwing for some time. Players have been wrestling with his Twilight's Hammer minions since before Cataclysm, and we’ve already seen Deathwing defeat Alexstrasza in single combat. The powers that be in Azeroth know Deathwing presents a mortal threat, so in the wake of all the chaos and destruction, forces are finally rallying to oppose him. That’s how patch 4.3 begins, with the major players of Azeroth gathering to decide how they are going to tackle this seemingly unstoppable monster. <br />
<br />
<br />
Insider: Can you tell us about the new 5-player dungeons that lead into the Deathwing raid?<br />
<br />
Scott Mercer: The short version is that the players are sent on a series of quests to recover the Dragon Soul artifact so Thrall and the other dragonflights will have the firepower they need to confront Deathwing. The new 5-player dungeons involve the Caverns of Time and require the players to go forward in time to witness a future where Deathwing has destroyed the world. Then, from that bleak future, they must go back in time to the War of the Ancients to recover the Dragon Soul and bring it back to the present. We’ve discussed a lot more details on the new 5-player dungeons in other interviews. They're going to lead in directly to the patch 4.3 raid instance, which is called Dragon Soul. When the raid begins, the players have recovered the Dragon Soul artifact and arrive at Wyrmrest Temple to find it under siege by Deathwing’s forces. <br />
<br />
<br />
Insider: Aside from a battle with Deathwing, what other encounters do you have planned for the Dragon Soul raid?<br />
<br />
Scott Mercer: When players first arrive at Wyrmrest, they have to fight off a variety of Deathwing’s minions who are laying siege to the temple. There’s Morchok, a stone giant who is pounding the base of Wyrmrest, and Warlord Zon’ozz and Yor’sajh the Unsleeping, two servants of the Old Gods in league with Deathwing who are summoning more minions to sack the gates.<br />
<br />
In addition to lifting the siege around Wyrmrest, the players also have to return to the Eye of Eternity to get the Focusing Iris so the Dragon Aspects can refocus their power into the Dragon Soul. We have some new gameplay elements in mind for these raids, including a mechanic where players are granted the ability to dodge a deadly attack from a twilight dragon by phasing away.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Insider: What details can you tell us about the Deathwing raid? How does it differ from other raids? <br />
<br />
Scott Mercer: Dragon Soul is the most story-driven raid we’ve ever created. We’re even building several cut scenes to transition between the last three stages of the final encounter with Deathwing. <br />
<br />
The first stage occurs as players are flying on an airship, chasing down Deathwing while his Twilight's Hammer drake riders are swooping in to harry the pursuit. In the second stage, players paratroop commando-style onto Deathwing’s back and start ripping up his armor, trying to pry a hole big enough to give Thrall a clean shot with the Dragon Soul. During this phase, players are actually riding on Deathwing as he’s swooping around and trying to knock the players off with barrel rolls and such. Players will have to hang on at key points in the fight to avoid falling while also tangling with all kinds of monstrosities that are rising out of Deathwing’s corrupted magma blood. Once the players get enough of Deathwing’s armor off, Thrall blasts Deathwing with the Dragon Soul and sends him crash-landing into the Maelstrom. <br />
<br />
Insider: Very cool! And the final stage? <br />
<br />
Scott Mercer: Well, the interesting thing about Deathwing’s armor is that it wasn’t really built to keep things out--he doesn’t have to worry about weapons like swords and arrows. Instead it was built to keep things in. His body is this incredibly volatile mixture of corruptive energy and burning magma, so without his armor to hold it all together, he starts to lose it and come apart in all kinds of crazy ways. The final stage of the raid begins when Deathwing’s deformed body rises out of the Maelstrom to face off against the players in the final showdown. I won’t go into too much detail about this final stage, but I will say that it’s going to be unbelievably epic. Even in his weakened state, Deathwing still presents a major threat, and bringing him down will require the combined efforts of the players, Thrall, and even the other Dragon Aspects. <br />
<br />
Insider: What difficulties did you encounter while designing the Deathwing battle? <br />
<br />
Scott Mercer: It took a lot of new technologies to set up the fight on Deathwing’s back. The artists in particular focused on selling the fantasy that you’re grappling with a giant dragon midflight. We’ve never done anything quite like that before. Overall, setting the right scope for an encounter like Deathwing required a lot of development disciplines working together--artists, coders, encounter designers, level designers, and animators. We built corrupted Deathwing as a giant set piece with a lot of moving parts--probably our most complicated character model to date--but we felt it was necessary to convey the epic scale and do justice to the final boss of Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Insider: Let’s talk loot. What rewards await players who are strong enough to tackle Deathwing the Destroyer?<br />
<br />
Scott Mercer: There will be a new tier of armor sets, of course. We’re also adding a new legendary weapon--a pair of daggers for rogues--with a new quest chain involved in obtaining them. The artists and animators are working on a new mount, a drake from the red dragonflight that borrows many visual elements from the Alexstrasza character model. Players can get one version of the new mount as the reward for the meta achievement for completing all other Dragon Soul achievements. There will also be a second, rarer version of the mount, that’s obtainable as a single, guaranteed drop off Heroic corrupted Deathwing. <br />
<br />
Insider: Thanks for your time. Is there anything else you’d like to share before you go?<br />
<br />
Scott Mercer: Sure, there’s a lot going into the next content update besides just the Dragon Soul raid--Transmogrification, Void Storage, the new Darkmoon Faire, and more. The patch should have something for everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love how the people who say that end up not killing the end heroic boss until after the expansion is over.<br />
<br />
Kill Heroic Deathwing in two weeks (impossible in one) and then talk.<br />
<br />
Anyways, of course the bosses will be downed quickly for the top 2-3 guilds, doesn't change anything for everyone else though. Didn't the top guild have trouble on Ragnaros, to the point of it taking even longer for them to down him, and over 600 attempts? I wouldn't call that &quot;easy&quot;.<br />
<br />
I didn't even think over 600 attempts on a boss was possible in two weeks. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

The character and plot development leading up to it thus far in Cataclysm were absolutely flawless and massive. Deathwing's character development along made me just hate him so much -- all the evil things he did, going around and blowing fire on zones! AMG, such a flushed out expansion, amirite</div></div><hr />

Looking forward to the 5 mans aswell,world could turn out and also the war of the ancients, hope they don't mess it up and stick to lore about the war, will be fun to play through old stuff in the war and fight the burning legion etc. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't matter how fast Paragon kills it, it matters how fast YOU kill it. Your idea of time spent when you say 'a day' is probably akin to 3-5 hours spent on it. That's not the case for Paragon and guilds of the same nature. A day to them ranges between 10 and 15 hours where they raid non-stop in order to bring down the beastie. This, coupled with the fact that the new raid model is set so that Normal Mode is meant to be about on par with Heroics of the previous tier in terms of damage requirements and whatnot, and yes, the guilds will breeze through normals and then spend as much time as you probably raid in a week in a single day attempting to bring the boss down. <br />
<br />
In the end, none of that has any bearing on your own play and the fact that people like you constantly say things like this really irks me.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if Deathwing's molten body will change forms during this phase, or if he is simply misshapen.</div></div><hr />

The spoiler is that there is apparently something IN Deathwing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, the interesting thing about Deathwing’s armor is that it wasn’t really built to keep things out--he doesn’t have to worry about weapons like swords and arrows. Instead it was built to keep things in...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shootyadead</div><div class="date">2011-09-21, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I can say is WOW. Seriously if they did this right, especially the fighting with/on Deathwing, I see this revitalizing the game in a big way. It literally seems like it will be a legendary fight. The mechanics of Deathwing doing barrel rolls and swoops and dives and you having to hold on, all the while keeping up with dps on adds or whatever there is at the time just sounds incredible. I honestly can't wait for it. It definitely seems like a fight that will have a lot of replayability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was thinking the same thing. Like Deathwing could transform into his human form in mid air then revert back to dragon form instantly leaving us raiders falling to our deaths! Or wait, does Deathwing follow our rules on having to be on the ground to mount back up???</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering that druids can change to flight form in mid-air, I would be amazed if dragons couldn't also. But regardless, the reason why Deathwing can't pull this maneuver is: it would short circuit the encounter the designers came up with, so of course he can't do it. Sigh. Remember when bosses actually went ALL OUT to kill you? (Looking at YOU, Archimonde!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since when is it difficult to copy another game? The 2nd Deathwing phase is taken straight out of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. To fight the Dracolich, a massive undead Dragon, you need to grapple onto it as it passes by and you start to attack key points to weaken it. During the fight the Dracolich will try to shake you off, requiring you to grasp onto the body and hold on for your life.</div></div><hr />

I wanna see if N'zoth comes up at all... I assume he will have dialogue when death wing falls into the Maelstrom, but what I really want to know is whether we'll end up fighting him. I don't think so, though :)</div></div><hr />

Shadow of Collossus says Hi ¬¬<br />
LoS that was a completely copy of another games, it fails as a Castlevania, and it fails as a game himself.<br />

And no matter if the idea to the fight against Deathwing come from other games, no one tried this in an MMO before, so...</div></div><hr />

I'd actually say it's partially that and partially Shadow of the Colossus.<br />

If it's done SotC style, it could be fun. If it's a QTE soaked buttonsmash fest of ''press now or die'', I have a bad, bad feeling about the fun factor.(I hate QTEs more than anything and think they generally ruin action games, so I admit I'm biased here.

Because, as everyone knows, all video games are coded in the exact same way. All video games use the exact same engine, and switching the code from a single-player game to a 25-man raid in an entirely different genre is as easy as picking &quot;MMO&quot; and &quot;multiplayer&quot; from the drop down boxes at the top.</div></div><hr />

I thought about this long and hard (thats what she said) and if they show us a future where Deathwing &quot;wins&quot; and then we go back to the present and kill Deathwing then the future we visited should never happen, which means that yes the armor we acquired should be no longer. BUT when we go back into the present with the dragon soul what other events will we set into action and can you really change the future? Maybe we think we kill Deathwing but we dont and the action we end up doing after seeing the future is the actions that were SUPPOSED to happen to make the future happen. So by us getting the dragon soul and &quot;killing&quot; DW, thats exactly what was supposed to happen and eventually Deathwing will destroy all.</div></div><hr />

Or wait, does Deathwing follow our rules on having to be on the ground to mount back up???<br />
<br />
the DEMON SOUL!!!! It prevents dragons from using their powers/ weakens dragons close to death (a orc was keeping Alextraza captive with just this artifact). I also remember Deathwing being imune to it`s power but somehow he was also unnable to use it. I bet Thrall and some of the great heroes (dragona spects included) did something to make Deathwing vulnerable to the artifact`s power. If not why go all the way back in a distant and paralel past to get the Demon Soul??? <br />

Let me put it this way, in-game, can you dismount and mount up again, while anyone or anything can attack you? NO you can't<br />

Seriously if they did this right, especially the fighting with/on Deathwing, I see this revitalizing the game in a big way. It literally seems like it will be a legendary fight. The mechanics of Deathwing doing barrel rolls and swoops and dives and you having to hold on, all the while keeping up with dps on adds or whatever there is at the time just sounds incredible. I honestly can't wait for it. It definitely seems like a fight that will have a lot of replayability.<br />
<br />
and then one month later of 4.3 going live:<br />
<br />
&quot;Patch 4.3 Hotfixes - December xx&quot;<br />
<br />
Deathwing<br />
<br />
- Health and damage have been reduced by 25% on normal difficulty. Health and damage have been reduced by 15% on Heroic difficulty.<br />
- Deathwing now do less barrel rolls.<br />
- Deathwing has less armor to be removed.<br />
- Deathwing blood is not thaaaat corrupted anymore, less monstrosities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Patch 4.3 Hotfixes - December xx&quot; (a week later lol)<br />
<br />
Deathwing<br />
<br />
- Health and damage have been reduced by 25% on normal difficulty. Health and damage have been reduced by 15% on Heroic difficulty.<br />
- Deathwing won't do arrel rolls.<br />
- Thrall is the sniper, he will headshot Deathwing after a few minutes of no progress.<br />
- The best gnomish engineering is employed and players now receive magnetic boots that will hook them to Deathwing's armor for the entire flight. 100% secure!&quot;<br />

First the unnerfed encounter is implemented for some time, so the better guilds can defeat it.<br />
Then it gets nerfed so the not so good guilds have a chance, too.<br />
And if neccessary nerfed even more.<br />

It's nothing bad, in my opinion.<br />

These type of fights have been done in lots of games, not just castlevania. Shadow of the Colussus jumps to mind. But the difficulty wasn't thinking it up, it was finding a way to make it work within WoWs game engine, that is over 6 years old and was never designed with this sort of mechanic in mind.

Final Fantasy games have been using this mechanic for decades.<br />
<br />

<br />
I bet we will be fighting Deathwing in a verry weakened state due to the Demon Soul or Dragon Soul (they are one and the same)<br />
<br />
The Dragon Soul was initially powered by 4 of the 5 Aspects, DW opted out essentially to get power over the other 4, but given Thrall was able to stand in as an Earth Warder of sorts when Chrommatus was fought, he might be able to imbue it in some way that Deathwing is now able to be hurt by it, given he originally was immune, as found out by Nekros or some other orc when they sent Tyrannastrasz after DW given the Dragon Soul would not affect DW, despite currently dominating Alexstrasza and others.<br />
<br />
Also, the TMNT vid, is it wrong the moment I saw him jump onto the sphere I thought Donatello was the best option given the attack animations for the Bo? Man I hated that game given it took ages to get through and if you died you had to restart. One of my few &quot;Never completed&quot; games. /shakesfist.</div></div><hr />

Thats what I am wondering, it is always explicit and said, we DO NOT MESS WITH THE PAST. So I don't know why we are going back in time to take such an important artifact from the past, that should still be in the time line because it is still used in later events...I don't get it.</div></div><hr />

Oh and what would make it worse is if there was some old god inside DW and in Phase 9.5 you have to enter the old god (like we have in every old god since they have been use) just to defeat him.<br />
<br />
Subscription staying cancelled. Will wait for something more interesting or possibly the next expansion. This one has to die out and it wont happen fast enough.</div></div><hr />

True that, hell even God of War did it in a few of their games. <br />
<br />
OT: I am stoked for these fights. Cant wait for the 5 mans, the raid, the race for world first by the top guilds, the tier.... Dragon Soul may just redeem Cata! (although I like cata regardless but some people dont feel as strongly about it :P)</div></div><hr />

Hmmm... there was Sin in FFX. But I can't really recall any mechanic like that in 1-9. And my knowledge of FF games post X is a bit lacking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Patch 4.3 Hotfixes - December xx&quot; (a week later lol)<br />
<br />
Deathwing<br />
<br />
- Health and damage have been reduced by 25% on normal difficulty. Health and damage have been reduced by 15% on Heroic difficulty.<br />
- Deathwing won't do arrel rolls.<br />
- Thrall is the sniper, he will headshot Deathwing after a few minutes of no progress.<br />
- The best gnomish engineering is employed and players now receive magnetic boots that will hook them to Deathwing's armor for the entire flight. 100% secure!&quot;<br />
<br />
Funny... but yeah... sad that it actually might happen.<br />

I thought about this long and hard (thats what she said) and if they show us a future where Deathwing &quot;wins&quot; and then we go back to the present and kill Deathwing then the future we visited should never happen, which means that yes the armor we acquired should be no longer. BUT when we go back into the present with the dragon soul what other events will we set into action and can you really change the future? Maybe we think we kill Deathwing but we dont and the action we end up doing after seeing the future is the actions that were SUPPOSED to happen to make the future happen. So by us getting the dragon soul and &quot;killing&quot; DW, thats exactly what was supposed to happen and eventually Deathwing will destroy all.<br />
<br />
so what you are saying is that we killed deathwing and impaled him on wyrmrest temple. so everything we do in 4.3 basically leads to the destruction of the world......... so why don't we not do anything then? i mean i can live with deathwing strafing a random zone now and then until eternity. what good is killing him outright if it means the world definitely ends? maybe instead of killing him we just beat him down to 1% health, and then give him a big dragon spanking and shake our fingers at him in disapproval.</div></div><hr />
