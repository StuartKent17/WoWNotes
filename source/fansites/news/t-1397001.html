Gamepedia (http://www.gamepedia.com/) recently announced that they are hosting the official Titanfall Wiki (http://titanfall.gamepedia.com/Titanfall_Wiki)!<br />
<br />
Trial of the Gladiator<br />
There was concern today (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/280299-rip-pvp-2004-2013-trial-of-gladiator-wod/#post61) that the new Trial of the Gladiator feature means the arena ladder will be removed, but it looks like more information will be coming in the future (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/401208289075003393). <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/november/trialOfTheBaddiator.png (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/401208289075003393) <br />
<br />
If you’re looking for some great Arena action, then Trial of the Gladiator is for you. Building on the same system used for the Arena Tournament realm, players who take part in Trial of the Gladiator will be able to enter and purchase gear, enchants, and gems from a vendor, and then match skills with other players. Similar to the Arena Tournament realm, an array of equal-quality gear and items will be available to all players, putting everyone on the same footing from the start of competition.<br />
<br />
Any player will be able to queue for this new feature once it’s available, but you’ll only be able to earn a rating during specific days and times of the week that rated competition opens up. This will help make the pool of serious combatants more concentrated, allowing the system to match players more accurately based on skill and helping ensure rated battles provide a highly competitive experience.<br />
<br />
You’ll be able to practice whenever you like outside of those times, but if you want to earn the prestige awards, you’ll need to hone your skills and climb to the top of the ladder at the appointed times. We also don’t want to penalize people too heavily for missing a scheduled combat or two, and we’re looking into ways to make sure the system strikes the right balance between flexibility and cutting-edge competition.<br />
<br />
<br />
Connected Realms Update<br />
As previously announced, we’ve been working toward connecting realms to increase the number of players on low-population realms, and since then have completed several connections.

Flying in Warlords of Draenor<br />
Warlords of Draenor and Flying Mounts<br />
No no no no no. I have paid what? something like 100,000 gold to buy flight for all my alts? You make us pay more gold to learn to fly in new zones and now you're taking this away from us? <br />
<br />
No this doesnt fly with me at all. What next? Level up an alt but she can't fly until I do the same quest? I appreciate you want to make something feel epic again. Taking something away from me that I've repeatedly earned and paid for sucks.<br />
<br />
I'm also tired of leveling up again with no flight. Once I have mastered flight, I should be able to buy a tome like cold weather flying. I dislike no flying until 6.1, but making me quest againto earn something I have sunk MASSIVE gold into, doesnt leave a good taste in my mouth. <br />
Flying isn't being taken away. It's still there in all the other places you've earned it/gained it. All of those mounts you have are still usable. You just won't be using them in Draenor (at least to fly with) until a little while later and you'll still be able to get it at some point. We plan to make travel though via flight paths as convenient as possible and make being on the ground worth it via discoveries within the world. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/280047-an-idea-about-flying/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10571977123?page=28#556))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor and Flying Mounts<br />
Those of you who are worried about the lack of flying early on in the expansion, remember that it will only apply to the new zones, and only for a limited time in most cases. The new zones are being designed with this in mind too—we're being extra careful to ensure that flying isn't missed too much. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/280101-how-can-people-hate-on-people-who-like-flying/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8690549279?page=1#20))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor and Flying Mounts<br />
I just want to emphasise to those of you who are worried: we're working to make sure you won't be hugely inconvenienced by the loss of flying as you explore the new content. There'll also be a sturdy flight path network to get you from A to B. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/280092-no-flying-till-61-confirmed-thanks-blizzard/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8690729358?page=3#42))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor and Flying Mounts<br />
Its not cool its just tedious and annoying to have to relearn to fly every gd expac. You know the expac I had the most fun leveling in Bash? It was cata because I could fly I could skip the camping skum i could nuke my quests; and then when I got to 85 I could put on a tabard and just grind my rep, it wasn't daily gated so I got it all done in about a day and a half it was wonderful.<br />
We know there is some portion of players that raid, or have some specific end-game goal, and that leveling and questing and mobs and the story and the actual rest of the game in general just gets in the way of that. But ultimately &quot;racing to end-game so you can put on a tabard and grind out rep&quot; isn't the name of the game we're making. We're not going to be able to force you to care about the music, or setting, or experience, but you gotta understand that the rest of the game is for everyone else that does care about those things, and at least consider the logical reasons we present that makes that content better for them, even if it means it could maybe slightly disrupt your ability to chain-queue for Heroics.<br />
<br />
Why not make the air more dangerous instead of taking away flying.<br />
We've tried that quite a few times, it's really just a symptom of how the game mechanics function that most of our forays into dangerous flight just feel really bad. On one hand they feel unnecessarily harsh because there's only a few things you can really do to someone while they're flying and they generally deal with stuns/slows/dismounts, and on the other hand there's just no fun gameplay that can really be had there. The best gameplay is at ground level because that's the basis for the design of our game's combat systems. We'd toyed with mounted/flying combat in the past but that could almost be a totally separate game on its own, and probably gets us too far away from what WoW is.<br />
<br />
How would this questing to unlock flying be the same? Its essentially dailies with the new name of Epic questing chain. You would most likely have to repeatly do things everyday or every week until you earn a certain gated number.<br />
Do I need to go edit that part out, or is everyone going to be able to refrain from deciding exactly what it is (and being angry about it) before we've even designed it?<br />
<br />
Nah, never mind, editing it out. Everyone is just going to focus on that and make assumptions about what that means.

Arenas<br />
I don't know where this idea came from, but just to clear things up, we have no plans to remove the current Arena ladder. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/280299-rip-pvp-2004-2013-trial-of-gladiator-wod/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10572507239?page=4#61))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
We do want to slim down on the overall number of gems and enchants you'll need to put on your gear. That's primarily a quality of life change. We want to make it less of a hassle to be able to equip a new item.<br />
<br />
That said, we don't think these changes have to mean that e.g. Jewelcrafting will no longer be a decent source of income. We could -- and this is purely a hypothetical example -- make the best gems rarer, which would drive prices up and increase profit margins. If you can make just as much gold (comparatively) off of one gem in Warlords as you can selling three in Mists, that'll help substantially.

<br />
Racial Changes<br />
There aren’t plans for any broad, sweeping changes to racial abilities in 6.0. We’ll probably tune some numbers so some racials feel less mandatory in certain cases. Also, due to the changes we announced at BlizzCon, there are several hit and expertise-based racials that will need to be replaced with something new—hopefully we can use those new racials to help shore up racial balance overall. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/280107-racials-next-expansion/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8626722944?page=3#46))<br />
<br />
Yak Reforge NPC<br />
We've talked about different options. Maybe transmog? Maybe item upgrades? We don't know yet. Your thoughts/feedback would be helpful. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/279972-reforge-mount-in-new-expansion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10497449913?page=1#13))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Heirlooms UI<br />
It's a new UI of (essentially) buttons that will &quot;light up&quot; when you obtain one (or have obtained one) of the heirlooms. Click the button and an item of that type will be generated and put into your bags. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/279969-heirlooms/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10570636969?page=1#3))<br />
<br />
<br />
Character Transfer Services<br />
It looks like there are no plans to add a bulk character transfer option at this time.<br />
The cost associated with the migration service actually helps to regulate the amount of realm hopping going on, which in turn helps to prevent huge 'overnight' realm population fluctuations. <br />
<br />
It's certainly a useful service for people who find themselves stranded without friends etc. but we don't currently have any plans to change the way it works or add a multi-character move option. However, we hear you loud and clear and will continue to pass on everyone's thoughts.<br />
<br />
Some very valid points, thanks once again. <br />
<br />
I've mentioned this in other threads, but right now—especially during the Connected Realms roll-out—we're not looking to make any changes to the migration services. Once things have settled, we can take a step back and assess the situation. <br />
<br />
Please know that we totally want you all to be having the best possible experience while playing. There is no simple fix to this that works for everyone. There are solid reasons why we can't currently offer free transfers to any realm, even with cooldowns as some have suggested, but we're constantly working to develop and implement other solutions that will help as many people as possible.<br />

Patch 5.4.2 PTR - Power Word: Barrier<br />
The 100% damage reduction on Power Word: Barrier (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/62618/#17538-17585) in the latest PTR build is just a tooltip error (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/november/blizzTTError.png).<br />

Game designers go to a tremendous amount of effort in designing these new zones, and they want us to be able to see everything first hand as opposed to just flying past it all.<br />

Do you play this game? Flight paths don't allow you to skip packs of mobs or cut an instant route to any location, they drop you off at the nearest town/outpost. Not even remotely the same thing.</div></div><hr />

I'm so glad their taking the time to show people the environment and what they have given to us. When you fly over everything, you're missing out on the beauty and artwork of areas. I didn't have flying in BC till about 3 weeks after I hit 70. And to tell you the truth, riding around made me love the areas more. It made me figure out what I could do to avoid certain things or go in and fight hard.<br />
<br />
People don't take the time to explore and have fun. Maybe it's because WoW has become to much of a hurry to end-game and beat the bosses race to the finish deal. I prefer that feeling of taking my time and enjoying it and understanding the reasons why I'm going to this new area, and what it is I need to understand and explore.<br />
<br />
They did a decent amount of that in MoP, to understand the Horde and figure out what's to come and what we're fighting for. There are certain undertones people overlook, and doing certain things to return to the roots in some fashion is a great way for people to enjoy the game once again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. This is not new. It's been done before, only difference is that if you get to 100 before 6.1, no flying for you yet. Does it matter though? There will be dynamic content for you in the world. Also you will be in queue for dungeons more than likely.<br />
<br />
2. They also said they are considering upgrading. The point that people got the mounts and have used the mounts, pretty much most certainly says people have gotten their prestige mount money's worth. No refund is necessary.<br />
<br />
3. If you think the charge for character transfers isn't a deterrent to realm abandoning, please, pay for my transfers. I have 9 characters I would love to transfer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they allow you to take a designated repeated route to and from set flightpaths while skipping packs of mobs and being delivered out of the way to the nearest town or outpost, which could still be 5 minutes without being dismounted out of the way of where you intend to go. You take a flight path once, you know exactly what it looks like and have no need to see it again. <br />
<br />
You use your flying mount and see something shiny on the ground through the trees, or a rare spawn, or a fun place to take a screenshot.. and you've suddenly went out of your way while taking more time to appreciate the play dough textured grass and trees they've created.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes newer expansions came with dungeon finder, with better graphics, many conveniences, ... but I personally would MUCH RATHER have the amazing old content back: the awesome raids (Ulduar, Sunwell, ...), I wouldn't mind losing some perks so that ppl would once again hang out in Dlaran and that my fav zones in Northrend wouldn't be completely empty. Now those awesome zones are just something you have to rush through to get to max lvl. And soon my 2nd fav continetn (Pandaria with it's beautiful zones) is gonna become irrelevant too.<br />

I don't know if you noticed but to keep up and stay competitive you have stuff to do on daily basis and no flying = a lot more time every day<br />

I don't mind taking longer to get to 100 ... actually I would prefer it taking longer really, I do mind taking longer to do stuff you kinda have to do every day/week/... to stay at the ''top'' and be able to stay competitive so you can do the content properly (raids)</div></div><hr />

You know what's interesting? It's that people keep whining like little fucktards for the &quot;old days&quot; to come back. And when suddenly it becomes a less convenient game some other party will whine like little fucktards again.<br />

What I get from this, is that this game isn't for everyone and it seems Blizzard just chose which crowd to keep.</div></div><hr />

So 60% of the hardcore wow players who are so obsessed with it they actually go to websites to discuss the game are in favor of blizzard doing something? You don't say. Don't kid yourself, you're the majority here in fanboy land. Not in the actual game. You can't give people convenience then take it away. What's next? They take away dungeon finder? Raid finder? Ground mounts? Portals? Summoning stones? Rezzes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually its because it would be a huge amount of work to fork the WoW code and keep multiple versions of it maintained with all the same bug fixes and quality of life improvements for a tiny, tiny percentage of the playerbase who once they got their old servers would likely only play for a month or two before going &quot;Well that was fun, scratched the nostalgia itch, whats next?&quot;<br />
<br />
The no flying stuff lets blizzard craft a much tighter experience for the players because they can control the environment around you more and put you right where they want you to be. Its the same rationale behind one set size for raids at Mythic difficulty, because then they can really custom craft the encounters and do truly unique things with them since its so specialised and they can make a lot more assumptions about what will be going on since they have more control over the situation. Its not like levelling is going to take you longer because you wouldn't have flying anyway, and its not like getting around the world is going to take you longer if they deliver on their promise of having a comprehensive system of flight paths, it just means you're going to get a much higher quality of content to play through at max level than you otherwise would have. Think about it, when you can't fly, and you actually have the navigate through the environment, it opens up a whole world of things they can throw at you besides &quot;Go here and kill these mobs&quot;, because you can't just get a quest, jump on your flying mount, skip everything in between and land at the feet of the thing you need to kill.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SkyeMcCloud</div><div class="date">2013-11-15, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, they allow you to take a designated repeated route to and from set flightpaths while skipping packs of mobs and being delivered out of the way to the nearest town or outpost, which could still be 5 minutes without being dismounted out of the way of where you intend to go. You take a flight path once, you know exactly what it looks like and have no need to see it again. <br />
<br />
You use your flying mount and see something shiny on the ground through the trees, or a rare spawn, or a fun place to take a screenshot.. and you've suddenly went out of your way while taking more time to appreciate the play dough textured grass and trees they've created.<br />
<br />
The idea of not allowing flight until 6.1 isn't suppose to stop you from flying from one town or outpost to the next. It's suppose to stop you from doing the exact thing you described: use your flying mount and stay away from all mobs in relative safety until something shiny catches you interest, where you then go down and find a way to land where you won't pull a single mob, then land, do what you wanted, and remount and leave without any other mob getting in your way. They DON'T want you doing that. They want you to work to get that rare mob or that mining node, not skip over any problems and go.<br />
<br />
Flight paths are simply to allow you a way to travel quickly from A to B. It doesn't take you to the precise spot you want. You still have to make that journey to where you REALLY want to go, though. It's not about seeing what they've made (though that's a bonus to it), it's about trying to make the content, ALL the content, they make have meaning for a while, to make it not just a breeze to get exactly what you want. This is why flying's not allowed on Isle of Thunder or Timeless Isle. It's why it wasn't allowed on Tol Barad.<br />
<br />
You can go a couple months without flying in the new zone, because that's all you'll be waiting. You'll still be able to do everything you want to do and get to everywhere you want to go, it just won't be as easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's funny how they said they're trying to, y'know, NOT do that with WoD. They want to move away from just daily grinding every day. They want the max level quest experience to be just that; quests. You do them once and that's it. Yes, you'll see some dailies, but if they keep to what they said you'll see a lot less. They're trying to find a balance in it all, and that takes experimenting. A dungeon-only model, as was the way for many factions back in vanilla and BC, wasn't fun. The tabards were nice but made it way TOO easy, because people could ignore dailies if they wanted. Doing dailies is just taxing. So let's see what they plan to try out next and see if it works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh. Roll on a PVP server - make sure you're in the losing faction population-wise - play there for a good six months, and then say that again. Me, I play on a PVE server now and couldn't care less, other than it's really insulting and makes my characters feel much less heroic. Oh and my remaining alts on that PVP server are even more super dead to me now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, never mind, editing it out. Everyone is just going to focus on that and make assumptions about what that means.&quot; &lt;-- Really Blizz? And what does that tell you? That your decision is unpopular? That we hate the very idea of having to quest to get flying back in the first place? How about a 1 step quest immediately after the patch drops, or an item in our mailboxes from a super-smart gnome or goblin which magically/mechanically enables us to fly? <br />
<br />
That said, they've acknowledged the bigger problem a couple of times - that basically each expansion pack sets to a relative level 1 and you have to level up from scratch, and so far making us feel badass at the beginning is really hard without making the game feel too easy. <br />
<br />
Finally, I do appreciate their words on why they don't just make flying dangerous and be done with it. I had brought this up a number of times. They said it's an engine and game system thing. While that's too bad, it's at least understandable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;No no no no no. I have paid what? something like 100,000 gold to buy flight for all my alts? You make us pay more gold to learn to fly in new zones and now you're taking this away from us? &quot;<br />
<br />
I paid just as much for riding skills &quot;back in the day&quot; as today while gold wasn't as available as it is now. That when you hit max level you have 20k gold from questing only.<br />
You actually had to farm the gold instead of having it automatically from questing. As a new player I wasn't even able to buy basic riding skills without having to get gold from somewhere unlike now. And it took me quite some time to get 5k gold for my epic flying skill during TBC while now I just buy it instantly as soon as I ding max level without the help of other characters.<br />
<br />
So yeah I agree, spoiled. If I had children and they complained like some people here... that's really not going to fly. <br />
<br />
I don't even understand why it matters if you fly, ride or walk as long as it's fun. If it's about the gold, everyone paid for it and we have never been able to fly straight away in a new expansion except cataclysm for very good reasons...<br />

wrath was amazing, it had my fav zones, my fav raid, I liked the main city actually being in Northrend instead of SW and Org (because you spent enough time in those 2 even then) ... it just generally had the best feel to it all<br />
<br />
I would love to play it all again but sadly it's now impossible to play anything from wotlk normally :'(<br />
<br />
Cata was imo the worst expansion to date (one of the worst things in cata for me were zones and so far draenor zones sound to me like they could be quite similar), MoP I really like but it's not what wotlk used to be (I especially love teh pandaria zones, but even that will soon be forgotten)<br />
<br />
I love wow because of it's world and the savage primal land of Draenor (as it was described) just doesn't sound to me like something I would want to spend a lot of time in, storm peaks, howling fjord, grizzly hills, kun lai summit, jade forrest, valley of the 4 winds, ... those kinds of zones I love because thy are beautiful to just explore and travel around</div></div><hr />

<br />
So they should not make any changes? That will also piss people off. If they make riding skill cost one gold more people will be pissed off... apparently :S.<br />

Let events speak for themselves, &quot;son&quot;.<br />
<br />
The level of whine on the forums vastly outnumbers that in-game. No-one in my guild has vocalised any real issues with the current news. Tradechat isn't being spammed by butthurt players. The only tears I see are here and on official forums.<br />
<br />
Please, carry on. Make assumptions and prejudge and complain. Its amusing to those of us who've seen it all happen before, and know that waiting patiently for the end result usually results in few disappointments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, having by far the largest MMO in history a decade after it's release is successful. It's pretty obvious why WotlK was peak of WoW. They did mess some things up along the road but even if they didn't people would leave. It's how games work. Especially games that are 10 years old.<br />
<br />
I salute no-flying decision. I has a lot of pros and the only con it really has is that they are taking fastest means of travel. Travel. Travel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They made it pretty clear that they're taking away server first 100<br />
You don't even have to fly to dungeons anymore cause you got LFG system<br />
If you do have rep items needed again, you can use flight path to get to the quartermaster in that town<br />
Why would you want to skip mobs if they give you xp? Or can you not just follow the road and have to be that daring person who likes to run in everything?<br />
Gold is so easy to get now, that you'll eventually be ok to buy it once it does come out I don't even know how that's even a reliable counter-argument..<br />
<br />
I just don't get it...What is no flying really taking away...laziness? I have some pretty hot ground mounts that I look forward to using again. I feel likes people are trying to make them change their minds...they couldn't do it with 20-man mythics..so moving on to the next thing..<br />
<br />
I doubt people can even just sit down..and actually wait till the expac is out to start giving real feedback...It's not even out yet...you haven't even experienced it yet...why in heaven's name are people complaining. I feel like people are kids that get a new type of food in front of their face..say they don't like it without trying..and then when forced to eat it...it becomes their favorite type of food. If you don't like it..well darn..the least you can do is try without saying anything until you're 100% sure.</div></div><hr />

I'm surprised Blizz is even answering these questions anymore. They are doing it to make gameplay more fun not just to spite you. If you can fly you can just pick up the quest, fly in a straight line to the objective, complete it and fly straight back. Where's the fun in that? I loved questing in Pandaria when it was released, making my way through the zones with friends, deciding to move to a new zone and finding the way there. So can we please stop with the stupid questions so we can get some real info.<br />
<br />
For example does anyone know how heirlooms will work. They plan to change stats on a piece of gear if you change spec. Will it be the same for heirlooms? Will there just be a plate, leather, mail, cloth set now or the same as usual? If so will it not feel a bit strange when everything else changes to your spec except the heirlooms?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Let's do an item squish and make people log in and freak out cause they feel weaker.<br />
2. Let's take away flying from them for 3 months. Did all those dailies to unlock your awesome onyx cloud serpent? Suck it up you won't be seeing it for awhile!<br />
3. Let's change your character and when you don't like it tell you to suck it up and pay to fix it!<br />
4. You like raiding in a 10m? Too bad! Go recruit an entire raid team or quit, we don't care!<br />
5. Removing gear customization cause that stuff is too hard gaiz!<br />

I think we would all be fine if you decided to cancel. While some of your complaints seem bad at first, ALL OF THEM have GREAT CONSEQUENCES. Convenience and all options isn't a good thing. Some things like item squishes are necessary, not to mention, you ALWAYS feel weaker in a new xpac.<br />

<br />
This is actually why I don't raid anymore, a few years ago before I could drive, I'd play a lot more and raid and that was fine. I didn't like relying on people for anything, and yet liked being a spoiled princess. So sometimes I'm bored and log in and one annoying comment and I go full troll mode or I just log off. Not having flying in WoD is pretty much that. It's such a non-issue for me, that I can't possibly see why people get upset about it (to the level of that 3 paragraph poster with the blue response). I just... grow up already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes newer expansions came with dungeon finder, with better graphics, many conveniences, ... but I personally would MUCH RATHER have the amazing old content back: the awesome raids (Ulduar, Sunwell, ...), I wouldn't mind losing some perks so that ppl would once again hang out in Dlaran and that my fav zones in Northrend wouldn't be completely empty. Now those awesome zones are just something you have to rush through to get to max lvl. And soon my 2nd fav continetn (Pandaria with it's beautiful zones) is gonna become irrelevant too.<br />
<br />
Blizz you are down to 7.7m ... why not try that out, the content for that is ready made<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, did I miss the patch where they removed Ulduar and the Sunwell from the game? Or the patch where they disabled the ability to lock your experience so you remain at a certain level?<br />
<br />
I've never understood the people who clamour for servers locked to old content. You have the ability to live in the past right now if you want to. Lock your experience at level 70 or 80, form a guild with others who have done the same, and go have fun in Sunwell or Ulduar. If you can't manage to drum up enough support to get this going... well, then maybe you have your answer for how popular old content servers would really be.</div></div><hr />

I rather like the waiting period they're introducing. It should make world PvP interesting for a bit while the masses level up. I fully sympathize with the guy talking about alts, though.

<br />
Actually, casuals will be hit hardest by this. Hardcore players can spend the time on the quest line to unlock flight and still have time for other things. Casuals don't have as much time to devote to things like that. Casuals are also less likely to keep up with WoW news, so they'll be less likely to be ready for the end of the quest come 6.1. That means more work getting flying when the hardcores have prepared. This is true especially when you take into consideration alts, unless the unlock is account wide.</div></div><hr />

You are forgetting that core of the no-flying-mounts people have already farmed mats in vanilla with no flying, pvp server, having to &quot;farm&quot; single node multiple times to get everything in it and even killing mobs around them took twice as long.

Your logic is complete and utter failure. What if I want to kill every mob with 1 skill and get all the best raiding gear free from vendor. I'm paying for the game, right? If someone wants to take their time to raid and put in the time and effort to get that gear they still can.<br />

Though the example is not fair, because when you scoop down with your flying mount to take the nodes, nobody else can get them. But when I get all the BiS gear from vendor day 1, nothing important was lost, because immersion is not important in game, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I paid just as much for riding skills &quot;back in the day&quot; as today while gold wasn't as available as it is now. That when you hit max level you have 20k gold from questing only.<br />
You actually had to farm the gold instead of having it automatically from questing. As a new player I wasn't even able to buy basic riding skills without having to get gold from somewhere unlike now. And it took me quite some time to get 5k gold for my epic flying skill during TBC while now I just buy it instantly as soon as I ding max level without the help of other characters.<br />
<br />
So yeah I agree, spoiled. If I had children and they complained like some people here... that's really not going to fly. <br />
<br />
I don't even understand why it matters if you fly, ride or walk as long as it's fun. If it's about the gold, everyone paid for it and we have never been able to fly straight away in a new expansion except cataclysm for very good reasons...<br />

People used to hunt for their meals. Oh now you go to the store to get food? YOU SIR ARE SPOILED.<br />

I will be nice to not have to deal with players flying from point A to point B, kill quest-specific mobs/pick something up and fly back - that's not a game, there's no fun whatsoever in that. <br />
<br />
Go play other MMOs where there's no flying (Rift comes to mind, LotRO as well), exploration = fun. Having to kill mobs to get something = more XP. Unexpected event along the way = the best sort of fun.<br />

I love little zones like Timeless Isle and Isle of Thunder not having flying. However I don't understand how taking a flight path allows you to &quot;see more of the content&quot; when I take flight paths 90% of the ground loads and unloads before I have a chance to see any of it, when I am on my flying mount I am near the ground flying between trees looking for things, exploring for random Easter eggs.

At the beginning of an expansion they DO. NOT. WANT. you to rush through anything. That puts a lot more pressure on them to produce a patch, giving them less time to produce it, and thus a crappy patch which will get complained about because they think Blizzard didn't put enough effort into it. (Well duh, crying that your bored because you've been able to rush to 100 by flying everywhere.) By forcing us to take things slower (again, at the beginning of an expansion), it gives them a small breather and more room to work on following patches. The only time they ever want you to really &quot;rush&quot; through anything is at the end of an expansion. Because by then you've done everything on your main, and they want to give you the ability to rush an alt up to actually keep you playing when they aren't producing patches, and are focusing on the next expansion. (ex: Timeless Isle). That is just how this whole thing works, and the people that are whining about not being able to rush through crap just really don't get it. That is not how your supposed to play this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Generally speaking, if your post seems whiny, then very few people are going to take your opinion seriously. If you want Blizzard to hear you, try complaining in a manner that doesn't make you sound like such an asshole. That being said, I don't think Blizzard is going to budge on this one. So, show them your concern, and don't buy the expansion. If not being able to fly for a few months is that much of a deal-breaker, just don't play until the change is implemented.</div></div><hr />

I paid just as much for riding skills &quot;back in the day&quot; as today while gold wasn't as available as it is now. That when you hit max level you have 20k gold from questing only.<br />
You actually had to farm the gold instead of having it automatically from questing. As a new player I wasn't even able to buy basic riding skills without having to get gold from somewhere unlike now. And it took me quite some time to get 5k gold for my epic flying skill during TBC while now I just buy it instantly as soon as I ding max level without the help of other characters.<br />
<br />
So yeah I agree, spoiled. If I had children and they complained like some people here... that's really not going to fly. <br />
<br />
I don't even understand why it matters if you fly, ride or walk as long as it's fun. If it's about the gold, everyone paid for it and we have never been able to fly straight away in a new expansion except cataclysm for very good reasons...<br />
<br />

Why don't you check achievement dates before you start the old man speech? I'm clearly a BC player. And no, its not about the gold. Its about every single mount ive earned. All 260 of them. I earned Epic flight for all 3 of my 70s through questing and professions in BC ALONE. Name ONE expansion where if I had the gold I couldnt fly at max level. Thats right, there isnt one. Yes, my mounts are my babies to me.</div></div><hr />

When did a blue (or anyone at blizzcon) say that the existing arena ladder would be gone? When did they say that the existing title and mount rewards would be gone? I see people constantly &quot;quoting&quot; things that seem to come from absolutely nowhere, but none of them actually say that the ladder or titles or mount rewards are leaving the current system. All they say is that there is a newer, different system being introduced that uses the same system as the Arena Server, not replacing the current system. Did people complain like this when Blizzard announced Heroic raiding, thinking that normal raiding was going to disappear?</div></div><hr />

I don't know if you noticed but to keep up and stay competitive you have stuff to do on daily basis and no flying = a lot more time every day<br />
<br />
I don't mind taking longer to get to 100 ... actually I would prefer it taking longer really, I do mind taking longer to do stuff you kinda have to do every day/week/... to stay at the ''top'' and be able to stay competitive so you can do the content properly (raids)<br />
<br />
What makes you think that they won't adapt the lvl 100 content to not having a flying mount? I doubt you'll have to do dailies in 6 different zones in 6.0. Well, there won't be many dailies anyways but I still doubt they'll &quot;force&quot; you to travel too much without flying mounts. I imagine that the max level content will be way more locally focused than it was in 5.0.</div></div><hr />

Hardcore players can spend the time on the quest line to unlock flight and still have time for other things. Casuals don't have as much time to devote to things like that. Casuals are also less likely to keep up with WoW news, so they'll be less likely to be ready for the end of the quest come 6.1. That means more work getting flying when the hardcores have prepared. This is true especially when you take into consideration alts, unless the unlock is account wide.<br />
<br />
No, this doesn't make sense. Being prepared doesn't make anyone a hardcore. Being prepared is also a choice. Obviously, if you can't be bothered to check out changed, then you don't really give a shit anyway.<br />
<br />
If no flying means you do things 10% slower, this 10% is still effecting your gameplay, whether you play for 1 hour a day, or 10 hours a day. Not to mention, no flying won't change a thing if you just sit in a city and queue for things.<br />

Every argument against flying is a complete and utter failure. On a PvE server, someone who wants to rush through the content and get to the end as quickly as possible, has to have something they want to do removed from them. So they have to pay, while everyone else gets what they want? No, that's not fair at all. The only option is leaving flying in, and letting people decide what they want to do and how to play. That way if someone wants to rush, they still can, while everyone else can look at the &quot;pretty&quot; virtual environment or take their time.<br />
<br />
I want a full set or T-17 on all my toons, Blizzard better gimme it! Why can;t I rush things when I want? I also want all my toons to level 100! Blizzard better do that too! Its only fair!<br />

Unbelievable how far fanboys will go to justify having features being taken away from them. Having a long ass chain of quests to get flying back? Might as well call them dailies.<br />

One thing I don't think people are mentioning about the no flying, when they take flying away for one zone it feels ok, but when you take it away for all 7 zones it feels like your being cheated. I love little zones like Timeless Isle and Isle of Thunder not having flying. However I don't understand how taking a flight path allows you to &quot;see more of the content&quot; when I take flight paths 90% of the ground loads and unloads before I have a chance to see any of it, when I am on my flying mount I am near the ground flying between trees looking for things, exploring for random Easter eggs. Seems to me that they don't want to polish things to much for 6.0 so they can deliver it faster and polish things for 6.1.<br />
<br />
Likely story man. Even if this is true, I doubt you spend much time at all doing it, and you're probably in a .05% minority that does. Pro Flyers just want and easy ride and more convenience.</div></div><hr />

The level of whine on the forums vastly outnumbers that in-game. No-one in my guild has vocalised any real issues with the current news. Tradechat isn't being spammed by butthurt players. The only tears I see are here and on official forums.<br />
<br />
Please, carry on. Make assumptions and prejudge and complain. Its amusing to those of us who've seen it all happen before, and know that waiting patiently for the end result usually results in few disappointments.<br />
<br />
That's because none of those people know what's going on. They won't know until they hit 100 and start spamming &quot;where is the flight trainer?&quot; in trade. Then we'll see who the vocal minority is. Remember when they gutted talents? The forums were bitching about it, and fanboys were defending it. That all happened when it was announced. Months later and it got put into place, THAT was when they started losing massive subs from it. Because those casual players don't read announcements and patch notes. They just log in when it happens and say what the fuck.<br />

If you can fly you can just pick up the quest, fly in a straight line to the objective, complete it and fly straight back. Where's the fun in that?<br />
<br />
Gotta love this hypocrisy. I can bet my savings this guy doesn't use ground mounts. When you were doing your klaxxi and golden lotus etc dailies were you using your ground mount? Hmm? No? Oh so why were you using your flying mount to do them? You just said yourself it's not fun when you fly. So why the hell were you purposely doing something that isn't fun? Is it not fun unless you're forced into it? And everyone else is forced? I thought so. Hypocrite.</div></div><hr />

You know it won't be account wide. Look at cloud serpent rep. They made us get it for all our alts which is entirely retarded. They will for sure force us to do the long &quot;legendary&quot; like quest chain to get flying on all our alts.<br />

Feel free to show us the MMOs with 7 million players that lets them just randomly hop around for free.<br />

Oh that's right it's not a big deal for most MMOs because they have next to no one playing them so the strain on the servers is non existent.<br />
<br />
7 million, that's hilarious. Here's the deal champ, most of those are in china. The last time they gave numbers per zone was when they were at 10m. They said 6m were in china, 2m in EU and 2m in US. So let's just be generous and say we're at 1.5m for US and EU, that they didn't drop that much. Those two zones can't play with each other. In other mmo's they can. I personally see more people running around in Rift than I do in WoW and that's with CRZ cheating. So if you look at it from US WoW which is 1.5m to Rift which is actually more than that since they had 1m BEFORE they went free to play. They allow bouncing around for free and it didn't screw up realm balance one but. But please, continue to blindly defend your gf while she gouges her customers for no reason.</div></div><hr />
