You can't really miss it, it's everywhere, the scale of some models is changed in 2.2. The most obvious one is the orc shoulders switched back to a &quot;normal&quot; size, but a few other races were changed. Basically, Orcs get bigger shields and shoulders, Draeneis slightly smaller shoulders, but our great winners are ... Night Elves ! They now have slightly (barely noticeable) smaller shoulders, and their weapons and shields are also smaller. You can compare with the screenshots" />

2.2 Release date<br />
Hortus made an interesting addition to his post concerning multiple patches on the PTR during the upcoming weeks. It seems that we could get the 2.2 sooner than what we expected last week after all. <br />
<br />
As we are approaching the final stages of 2.2 testing there shouldn't be as many patches coming in.<br />

Evocation changes in 2.2<br />
Hortus made a few precisions about power regeneration through skills like Evocation and Innervate in 2.2. Even if it's pretty clear in the patch notes (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=301970360&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#0) I guess it might be useful to some people.<br />
<br />
The change in evocation should not increase the amount of mana you gain, it only prevents an occasional timing issue where players were getting less mana then they should.<br />

Woodworking<br />
I think I've already heard this somewhere, but I'm not sure if I posted about it before and it's the first blue post confirmation anyway. Woodworking won't be released for WotLK and you're free to contribute in the post with tons of new ideas to make hunters happy.<br />
<br />
Your post makes it seem like woodworking is imminent. :) It's definitely in consideration for the future, but for Wrath of the Lich King, we are focusing on Inscription as the next new profession. <br />
<br />
More on what woodworking could possibly hold would have to be all based on wishful thinking and conjecture.<br />

Protection paladins<br />
There is also a huge compilation of all problems related to prot paladins on the official forums. The following blue post is only a small part of what's been said in this post and I suggest that you read it if you're looking to tank things. Keep in mind that itemizations changes might be available before the Zul'aman patch, new items like the paladin arena shields and the [Illidari Runeshield] (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/illidariruneshield.jpg) will be available in 2.2.<br />
<br />
I thought I did already, but I will try to be more clear. Nothing has been 'shelved' and problems are being addressed, however it may take some time... Last thing I heard was that some of the issues with itemization in particular will be addressed in the future Zul'Aman patch, however since I am not entirely sure about that, I will try to dig up some more info on that. <br />
<br />
Paladin Tanks are supposed to be a fully viable option to bring along to raids, so if there are too many shortcomings preventing that, then of course those things need to be addressed... Again I must clarify that it may take some time, but this should not discourage you from posting your concerns and suggestions :-)<br />

Not 100% sure on that shield resize for orcs though.. The shield you use as an example I have already got and I have got to say its position on the back already stops you seeing your characters head, wont be able to see anything with summat that big on there! ;)</div></div><hr />

WTB all the PVE, PVP, and gear changes to make the game a little more balanced IMO.<br />
<br />
I am sad though that Blizzard has changes things like Arcane Missles, Drain Life, etc... (Channeling spells) back to normal. On the logic that the character does not move and has to channel the spell, think of it as a DOT that while it affects you the caster cannot do anything else. So line of sight will again no longer break channeling spells atm on the PTR. =(</div></div><hr />

Wow, if this game bothers you THAT much, maybe you should have Mom and Dad set your parental controls to a little less time everyday.<br />

Back on topic, I don't see why implementing woodworking would be a problem for hunters. It wouldn't be much different than my poison profession as a rogue. Make the arrows BoP so they can't make any money off of them. It would be nice for them to be able to make their own arrows.</div></div><hr />

Wow, I wasn't even thinking of it like that. I was thinking of a woodworking class primed for hunters. But it would make it easier and much more sense to have it like the poison profession. Of course, then it would more along the lines of being a Fletcher profession, but that's splitting hairs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess it must come down to blizzard not seeing a real purpose to the profession. Unless the stuff you can create is better than what you can just buy now then there isn't huge use to it, and adding more powerful ammo gives the hunter a boost. There is also the fact that the ammo costs are there to offset the very low repair bills hunters have while grinding since they can very often avoid death and making the woodworking arrows cheaper would just be like giving free gold to hunters, and to be honest if they wanted to do that they can just make the existing ammo cheaper.<br />
<br />
Other than it being cool to create your own arrows I can't really see a valid purpose to the profession. What am I missing?</div></div><hr />
