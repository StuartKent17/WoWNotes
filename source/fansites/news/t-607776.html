Archimonde &amp; Eredar Twins Hotfix<br />
We just implemented a hotfix for all realms that makes Archimonde's doomfires no longer be able to move right through him after they spawn. Their movement should now be much more consistent with the previous patch's behavior, and melee should have a bit easier time dodging the doomfires as a result of the change. There have been other reports of odd behavior in the encounter since the 2.4.2 patch, but this is the only problem we've been able to verify locally. We'll continue to monitor reports of unusual behavior in this encounter, and investigate further as needed.<br />
<br />
We also hotfixed a bug in the Eredar Twins encounter that prevent a Hunter's Feign Death ability from working if Lady Sacrolash was alive.<br />

Polar bear mount confirmed in WotLK<br />
Some accomplishments will have a limited time in where you can get them, yes, but generally speaking there are quite few of them in the game. For players who are focused on romping around on a bear, there will be another one in Wrath of the Lich King. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=6440866066&amp;postId=64402674919&amp;sid=1#165))<br />
As Tigole put it, does a polar bear sound cool? (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=6440866066&amp;postId=64402675307&amp;sid=1#177))<br />
<br />
There is no plan to tune outdoor bosses for 25 players instead of 40<br />
If only 25 people were needed to take down Kazzak, then you could just fill the last 15 spots with nothing but DPS players and likely simplify the encounter. So the next step would be limiting raid sizes to 25 players instead of 40, but this would likely have a negative impact on things like Alterac Valley, city raids (for those that do them), and rotating players in raids (I know guilds that use the extra slots to track names). I understand that it's rough to suddenly need 40 people instead of 25 for an encounter, so if your guild is doing it, hopefully the loot rules can be explained clearly to all extra people - if you are going to another guild's, hopefully they explain them to you so you know what you are getting into.

Is there any plan to give Seal of Blood to the Alliance ?<br />
There are currently no plans for any changes in this regard, but we will of course let you know if it is ever decided to make any such changes. (Source (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=4009631426&amp;pageNo=2&amp;sid=1#37))<br />

MLG PC Circuit opens registration today<br />
Major League Gaming’s first ever PC tournament will open registration today, May 15th, at 7pm EST with World of Warcraft. The MLG San Diego event will feature $22,500 in prizes and be the opening event to the PC Circuit which will continue on to the MLG Orlando and MLG Dallas events later this year.<br />
<br />
Along with registration, MLG announced it will also be using Season 2 arena gear. The event’s gear list will be exactly the same as that which Blizzard is currently using on the Tournament Test Realm (TTR). Blizzard announced earlier this year that it would be using Season 2 arena gear for its Tournament Realm server. MLG will also NOT be allowing macros or mods during the tournament in an effort to keep an equal playing field for all competitors. (Gotfrag.com (http://www.gotfrag.com/wow/story/42393/))<br />

Bol.com (the site I preorderd it today) said 28th of November. But we'll see as long as Blizz won't make a official release date announcement I don't believe any date said :).</div></div><hr />

The dutch Bol.com? I can't find it there... where is it? I want to preorder too!! ;D<br />
<br />
edit: Nvm, found it. If you search on 'warcraft' it's not there, but if you search on 'lich king', it is. It's the normal version, so i'll wait until they put the CE on there :)</div></div><hr />

I was in the first wave of testers for the beta for TBC and the entire beta lasted almost 5 months. they had the levels capped at 67 for almost 2 of those months as well. <br />
<br />
Of course the initial release date of TBC was supposed to be in Nov. but it ended up being delayed until the following January, which did cause the beta to be extended for an additional month also (I think i remember the beta servers going down in Dec.).<br />
<br />
Also we have not yet started Arena Season 4 and they have said that would be before the release and would finish before it, and while I don't know what the average length for for the seasons have been it seems that to much still has to happen for it to be released in November of this year.<br />
<br />
Not saying it won't happen but I personally think its highly doubtfull regardless of what that statement reads.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking that too, so it is possible that Jan-May 09 would still be considered in Fiscal Year 2008.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Considering the statement very clearly states that BC released in the first half of 2007, they are either not using a fiscal calendar, or their fiscal calendar is the same as a calendar year.<br />
<br />
Barring any delays (we all know how those go) we should see the expansion before Christmas.</div></div><hr />

AOC is coming out and even tho Im in the group of doomsayers I have to say its getting better and better all the time. It is now bringin in the addictive side of the game and if Funcom handel this correctly we could see huge group of players switch games. AOC is something fresh and I got the feeling quite alot are looking for that atm.<br />
<br />
Like I said - Im not a fanboy of AOC but I have to admit that playing the past 2 days has me exited about MMO release for the first time since WOW came out. The potentials are huge. Alot more than most of us even can imagine atm. The game has graphics that will be compatable for gaming in the next 5-8 years without much upgrading and the PCs will just get better and better.</div></div><hr />

I would whole-heartedly agree.<br />
I was let into the closed Beta for AoC like 2 weeks ago. I'll admit, the first week was terrible. My framerate was non-existent, bugs everywhere, combat was unresponsive, and the game in general wasn't that &quot;fun.&quot;<br />
But then something amazing happened, one day after another they started rolling out these huge patches. First it was getting rid of the background debugger, then they did general bug fixes and combat improvements. And now, they just yesterday introduced the so-called &quot;Miracle Patch.&quot; All of the gameplay elements that were promised, yet weren't quite in yet, became available. City building. Spellweaving. City sieging. It's all there, and it's a blast. I literally can't stop playing now.<br />
<br />
Between AoC, WAR, work, and school I just simply won't have time to play an outdated MMO anymore. Yes, WotLK is nice and shiney and makes all these promises. But at the end of the day it's same old, same old. I, for one, am moving on. And I plan on enjoying every step of it.</div></div><hr />

Haha well, I just hope they speed up the WLK creating, tell us honestly how far they got into the game. (Are all the Zones done and all they're working atm with is class balance and raids!?)<br />
<br />
I'd like someone from Blizz to tell us eXactly what we're waiting for...</div></div><hr />

What is the PvE like in the game? I see that it will be heavy in the PvP department, but how engrossing is the actual storyline and questing/endgame (I realize this early in you aren't doing actual endgame content)? I really enjoy the art direction and lore of WoW, but I am finding the actual game kinda stale at this point and might be looking for something new depending on how WotLK goes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Beta testing was great for BC cause it was my first time testing. I don't want to level my character once let alone twice. That part of the game is not fun to me anymore. I'll let other's do that. Still love PvE though. Just wish WOTLK was coming out anytime this summer.</div></div><hr />

I think that blue post was from like july of last year. It would be interesting to hear an update on that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm betting next year also.</div></div><hr />

This will cause people to quit. That can, and I believe will lead to collateral damage down the road. I only think this game really has one more expansion in it before it loses a very high amount of it's player base. I just think they could keep it going longer with a summer or early fall release.<br />
<br />
I do hate to think that Arthas is two years away too. :) Yea...I don't think I'll be playing in two years. As was mentioned earlier in this post, wow is always mostly the same and certain parts of the game I think become tedious and eventually start outweighing the fun.<br />
<br />
I think this is all well known, this is just QQ. Thanks for listening.</div></div><hr />

PvE, to say the least, is a-mazing. It's the only thing that kept me playing a few weeks ago when everything else was god-aweful in beta. Every time you speak to someone, the camera zooms-in and the game goes into letterbox mode to give you the feeling like you're actually engaged in conversation. For every sentence the NPC says, you're given a list of possible replies (a la Mass Effect). If you want to skip straight through to get a quest, you can spam the &quot;1&quot; button to always just pickup whatever quest the NPC has to offer. Otherwise, choosing the other options gives you a lot of insight into the lore and world around you.<br />
<br />
Also, the first 20 levels or so are played out on what we like to call &quot;Noob Island,&quot; where the game is fairly linear, giving you all the tutorials you need to play and get the hang of your character, and also drive the storyline into why you're there, what you're doing, and who your enemies are.</div></div><hr />

As Gano (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=7549.msg89479#msg89479) said in the first page it's just a projected date they fill in. As I said before the only source to be truste is Blizz when making the official announcement. Webshops like Amazon tend to get as many preorders as possible and they fill in a date. With TBC some people went nuts cause a webshop entered a 2 weeks away from that moment ;).</div></div><hr />

If the only thing you do is playing wow, it will always get boring really fast, doesn't matter how fast Blizz can bring wotlk, Arthas, Emerald Dream, etc... (and btw, almost for that entire reason, we get some really poor content patches sometimes, full of bugs and recolors, they need to bring it fast to keep those lightning fast pace gamers playing/paying).<br />
<br />
If you do other stuff, even playing other games (other mmos, consoles...), you can be sure that you would not be that bored about wow and sunwell near end months before wotlk.<br />
<br />
Everything you play &amp; finishes really fast gets really boring if that's all you can do. That's why those &quot;1st kill&quot; guilds get bored soo fast. I really don't see the point in the &quot;sacrifice&quot; of doing it really fast so you don't need to raid 'til the next x-pac. It's not a obligation, project deadline from work,... it's there for fun (as blizzard says, with moderation).<br />
<br />
I can only play on the free time when I'm not working or with my family/friends/girlfriend. And when I have this free time, there are a lot of PC games and some console games that I wanna play besides WoW. I didn't saw Hyjal (well, just the human city part) or BT yet, not to mention Sunwell. So, for me, TBC still have a good life-span before WotLK, the same way old-WoW had (since I've started to play it 4 months before TBC).</div></div><hr />
