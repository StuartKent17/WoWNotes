Patch 3.2.2 Mount Changes 
Apparently, the price to train the riding skills has been slightly changed in patch 3.2.2 and the first rank of flying mount is now considerably cheaper. (Thanks to iridius for the tip)

Patch 3.2.2 Mount Changes<br />
Apparently, the price to train the riding skills has been slightly changed in patch 3.2.2 and the first rank of flying mount is now considerably cheaper. (Thanks to iridius for the tip) <br />
<br />
Expert Riding (150% Flying) now costs 250G (Down from 600G)<br />
<br />
The problem is, this change doesn't seem to affect all trainers. Trainers in Hellfire Peninsula will offer you the mounts at a reduced price but Hira Snowdawn in Dalaran will just try to steal all your money and will ask for the pre-3.2.2 prices. This isn't a reputation discount, I checked with different characters including RAF alts with no reputation like this one (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-reputation.xml?r=Elune&amp;cn=Arazu). (But keep in mind that you get a discount based on your Stormwind/Orgrimmar reputation instead of the Honor Hold/Thrallmar one in 3.2.2)<br />

Onyxia Now Resets on Tuesdays<br />
Note: The tuesday reset is for US. For EU it will be wednesday. Basically, it'll be the same reset as all other level 80 raids.<br />
With the updates to the Onyxia encounter in patch 3.2.2, this boss now resets every Tuesday like most raid instances. There was an issue when the patch first launched where an incorrect reset timer was listed. This has been resolved and Onyxia will reset next Tuesday as intended.

Cataclysm<br />
Cataclysm release date<br />
There is not yet a release date for Cataclysm. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20126974130-cataclysm-on-gamestopcom.html))<br />
<br />
Patch 3.3<br />
Patch 3.3 Information<br />
We're preparing some information to share with you about patch 3.3. You'll just have to stay tuned for that. I can say though that the five-player dungeon portion of Icecrown Citadel is absolutely epic and essential to the unfolding story of the Lich King and your battle to end his wrath. <br />
<br />
Vehicle Fights in Icecrown Citadel<br />
There will be no vehicular or mounted combat in the dungeon. [...] We talked at BlizzCon about an airship battle involving the Horde and Alliance ships in Icecrown for the raid, but this isn't really a vehicle fight comparable mechanically to those found in Ulduar, Wintergrasp, Isle of Conquest, or Trial of the Champion. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20143774976-please-let-casual-players-kill-arthas.html))<br />
<br />
Icecrown Dungeons<br />
That isn't our philosophy. We're carefully designing three separate wings of a sprawling five-player dungeon -- the largest we've released in a long time -- precisely so that a majority of our end-game player base can take part in an epic experience. You'll see plenty of significant areas, heroes, and foes in Icecrown Citadel without having to set foot in the raid. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20143774976-please-let-casual-players-kill-arthas.html))<br />
<br />
[...] The five-player dungeon is completely separate from the raid dungeon. It's not a five-player version of the same content. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20143774976-please-let-casual-players-kill-arthas.html))<br />
<br />
Patch 3.2.2<br />
Changes to Alterac Valley in 3.2.2<br />
It was explained in the sticky on the PvP Discussion forum. Unfortunately, a change to the level brackets for Alterac Valley made it into a build for patch 3.2.2 when it was intended for patch 3.3. Because of this the NPCs were not properly tuned for select level brackets. Given that this change was going to happen anyway, we made the decision to keep the level bracket change since it already went live and address any adverse affects as they arise. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20131894433-excuse-me-blizzard-devolopement-team.html))<br />
<br />
Requirements for holiday achievements<br />
Some holiday achievements require near maximum-level PvE content. This remains so even if people aren't inclined to reach maximum level.<br />
<br />
Some holiday achievements require players to go into battlegrounds. This remains so even if people aren't inclined to get honorable kills on their character.<br />
<br />
And, yes, some holiday achievements require skill in a secondary profession, and we have no plans to change that.<br />
<br />
The holiday achievements are not necessary to advance your character. If you want a title or the mount reward at the very end of What a Long, Strange Trip It's Been, however, you will have to participate at least marginally in all these aspects of the game.<br />
<br />
The holidays are designed to allow a large breadth of the playerbase to participate in some form, and there's normally something for you to do within the holiday itself. How much you choose to participate is up to you. If you choose to pursue the achievements, then you will have to participate in all these aspects of gameplay. That is absolutely by design and not something we plan to change currently.<br />
<br />
That said, if leveling your cooking for Winter Veil seems like a tedious task, I suggest you wait until Pilgrim's Bounty.... (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20136594563-now-were-cookin.html))<br />
<br />
Onyxia too easy?<br />
The new Onyxia is meant to be more of a celebration of the 5 years of World of Warcraft and not a progression encounter. The way it is setup is for as many people as possible to still enjoy in the game and get some extra bonus loot/emblems/bags/gems on top of that.<br />
<br />
On top of that, players certainly understand the game much better now than they did when Onyxia first came out. This became pretty clear when people didn't get much better gear but were able to kill her with fewer and fewer players even at level 60. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20126973800-why-was-the-new-ony-killed-so-fast.html))<br />
<br />
Arthas in Warcraft 3<br />
Warcraft 3 really established Arthas in the position of the Lich King in its expansion - The Frozen Throne. His relevance is not to be trivialized, but to say that we have established him as &quot;The Big Boss&quot; is a bit of a stretch. Warcraft 3 introduced a whole new level of threat to Azeroth - The Burning Legion. There have been some encounters with them and their powerful masters, but I'd hesitate to say that they've been &quot;defeated&quot; once and for all. We've also seen the rise of old gods such as Yogg'Saron and C'thun and I'm sure you're aware of the impending return of Deathwing. There is a whole slew of lore characters who haven't been around and thousands of plots and intrigues that have been developed throughout the lifespan of World of Warcraft and its expansions. Many big nasty bosses have been slain and still the problems of the world have not been alleviated. Perhaps, just maybe, there is more going on then one can gather in a glimpse. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20122733810-blizz-is-going-to-ruin-wow-with-the-lich-king.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman<br />
Blodlust / Heroism<br />
Bloodlust / Heroism is a very strong buff. No argument here. I can understand the point of view of players who think other specs need to offer it. Currently three specs offer it, but they are also specs that fill relatively different roles. The fact that all three specs belong to one class makes it a special case.<br />
<br />
In general, we balance 25 hard mode content assuming you have 1 shaman for Bloodlust or Heroism. We balance 10 hard modes without that assumption, though you still need to have a reasonable mix of the stronger buffs. We don't think that typically replacing a good say mage with a bad shaman will turn a failure into a success, but each group is a little different so it is possible.

Should still probably mention the whole honor hold/stormwind and thrallmar/orgrimmar change as well. Trust me, if you didn't realize it, it's news to 99.9% of people too.<br />

Nice work with the banhammer Boub, hope that was an IP ban... Absolutely no need for insults and rudeness over someone's simple misunderstanding- why can't we all just get along?<br />
<br />
Lots of interesting subtext in those posts:<br />
1) What's happening inside IC? Maybe Arthas isn't as in control of the Scourge as evidence suggests. Maybe he's fending off more Old God attacks/influence inside his own citadel (faceless ones in the basement of IC for example)<br />
2) 'Perhaps there's more going on than one can gather in a glimpse'- looking forward to the expanding lore here- who's pulling the strings behind the scenes? Have the Old Gods got together en mass to plot their takeover of Azeroth? Is Sargeras behind it all? Is there some other shadowy operator hidden in the shadows?<br />
<br />
Cataclysm is going to be pretty interesting from a lore perspective from the sounds of things...</div></div><hr />

Oh man thank goodness. I was really really hoping we wouldn't be seeing a Malygos 2.0 here, and now my prayers have been answered. Ulduar vehicle fighting was fun IMO, and I wouldn't have minded that, it's just the flying encounters which suck majorly (again, all imho). I'm still really psyched to find out what the 11 bosses are. I mean, one will obviously be Lichy, another Syandrigosa (sp?) but what about the other 8? I can't wait! ;D</div></div><hr />

People get upset over things they have feelings for, and its the feelings which makes people stay. As for IP, that's a bit unfair if someone else gets assigned that IP from the ISP (also, if they are really trying to cause trouble they can always get a proxy)</div></div><hr />

Would be simpler to change mechanics in some current abilities/talent buffs and / or making them baseline as well - an example could be Power Infusion thats currently in the priest discipline tree. It allready adds spell haste, so could easily be switch to match blood lust.<br />

[...] The five-player dungeon is completely separate from the raid dungeon. It's not a five-player version of the same content. (Source)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that the 5 man will be a different dungeon to the raid (just like SSC was a different instance to Steam Vaults, Tempest Key Eye different from Arcatraz etc.).<br />
<br />
In fact, thinking about it - does the '3 wings' mean three different instances like Tempest Keep was with Bot, Mech and Arca, or 1 instance but you walk in and can go three different ways? I suspect the latter, but would probably prefer the former.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't be upset if they decided to give bloodlust/heroism to another class, the problem is Shaman have alot of experience with it.. we've been using it knowing the consequences of timing it wrong for years. If you give it to a class that's more popular such as Dk's or Paladins all it takes is one person who gets their kicks from pissing off a raid by using it right before a boss while everyones buffing. Not to say it doesnt happen with Shaman but it is good too not spread it around.</div></div><hr />

You have to think of the other aspect of WoW, and by that I mean as long as RMP is as dominant as today, blizz giving priests esp disc bloodlust/hero is something that aint happening.<br />
<br />
And if they start giving BL/Hero to other classes I expect some serious buffs in return for the shaman class, because as it stands today there is absoloutly no reason to take them into hardmodes outside of BL/Hero.</div></div><hr />

Blodlust / Heroism<br />
Bloodlust / Heroism is a very strong buff. No argument here. I can understand the point of view of players who think other specs need to offer it. Currently three specs offer it, but they are also specs that fill relatively different roles. The fact that all three specs belong to one class makes it a special case.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just wanted too let you know Bloodlusy is spelled wrong in the title...don't take this offence or wathever just trying to keep frontpage clean of typos. :)<br />

If mentioned before, sorry. ^^<br />

Some holiday achievements require near maximum-level PvE content. This remains so even if people aren't inclined to reach maximum level.<br />
<br />
Some holiday achievements require players to go into battlegrounds. This remains so even if people aren't inclined to get honorable kills on their character.<br />
<br />
And, yes, some holiday achievements require skill in a secondary profession, and we have no plans to change that.<br />
<br />
The holiday achievements are not necessary to advance your character. If you want a title or the mount reward at the very end of What a Long, Strange Trip It's Been, however, you will have to participate at least marginally in all these aspects of the game.<br />
<br />
The holidays are designed to allow a large breadth of the playerbase to participate in some form, and there's normally something for you to do within the holiday itself. How much you choose to participate is up to you. If you choose to pursue the achievements, then you will have to participate in all these aspects of gameplay. That is absolutely by design and not something we plan to change currently.<br />

Ya know, the more i think about it. If they were to give a talented heroism to another class, it should be Mage. Because they already have a talent that increases their speed by 20%, Icy Veins. They would just have to make it raid-wide.<br />
Being a TTW Fire, i would be &quot;forced&quot; to have FFB as offspec, but i would care if it would make the different between heroism and no heroism.<br />
<br />
Icy Veins is quite a good candidate for talented heroism.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Shouldn't be an issue actually. I recently emptied all my alts of any gold after buying a DMC for my rogue. Started leveling my shaman. He was recently dinged 71 when I stopped to level my warrior for a bit. So when I picked up leveling him again, he had less than 1g on him. He turned 75 last night and now has 1200g on him. And that's after trainings every level, getting the Grand Master trainings for Herbalism and Alchemy as well as Alchemy training and a respec because I forgot to have preview talents enabled, so he could easily have over 1500g on him.. Granted he is decked in all t6 epics and I bought him the Cold Weather tome (for the record, if you can afford this for your alts, whether they have non-epic or epic flying, I really recommend it because it makes leveling so much faster).<br />
<br />
Basically, making gold is not an issue at all. Being that he was decked in full t6 epics (and he has a full resto off-spec of t6 epics), I haven't needed to use any quest rewards. So, any greens I get that are soulbound, I sell to a vendor and any BoEs I send to my mage to DE and I get the enchanting mats to sell or use for my main (or to level my mage's enchanting if I ever get around to it).<br />
<br />
I wonder if the heirloom shoulders and chest affect max level gold making? Since at max level, quests offer gold instead of experience, and the amount of gold is dependant on the experience you would have gained from the quest had you not been max level, I wonder if you gain an extra 10-20% gold from the max level quests you do while wearing heirloom items.</div></div><hr />

I haven't noticed a change in Artisan Riding, My LVL 71 Shaman is exalted to Org, and he can get the Expert Riding for 200, and Artisan for 4000. That's 250 and 5000 without Rep discounts, so having no reputation with Kirin Tor yet means Hira will want 250/5000 respectively.</div></div><hr />

Warcraft 3 really established Arthas in the position of the Lich King in its expansion - The Frozen Throne. His relevance is not to be trivialized, but to say that we have established him as &quot;The Big Boss&quot; is a bit of a stretch. Warcraft 3 introduced a whole new level of threat to Azeroth - The Burning Legion. There have been some encounters with them and their powerful masters, but I'd hesitate to say that they've been &quot;defeated&quot; once and for all. We've also seen the rise of old gods such as Yogg'Saron and C'thun and I'm sure you're aware of the impending return of Deathwing. There is a whole slew of lore characters who haven't been around and thousands of plots and intrigues that have been developed throughout the lifespan of World of Warcraft and its expansions. Many big nasty bosses have been slain and still the problems of the world have not been alleviated. Perhaps, just maybe, there is more going on then one can gather in a glimpse. (Source)<br />

That is still the situation with BL/Hero, *as the only buff in the game*. During the summer we've had numerous 10 man raids in ulduar trying hard modes, but only the ones with a shaman had a decent chance of making most of them. It got to a point where we would leave out top players in the guild for newly made shaman alts on sub par players. For the sole reason of Heroism. <br />
<br />
Even a slightly watered down version on another class would alleviate the need for shamans in 10mans that try hard modes.<br />
<br />
As for the need of Shamans otherwise, a good shaman is still a good addition to a raid in either of his three roles. Not to mention that totembuffs still have a place as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you're right. Balance is bad, lets nerf DK's so you have your advantage again, guess a lot of people would come back to play all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
Also - If they are going to give Bloodlust/Heroism to other classes, why should it be talented? I thought Shaman's just learned it off from the trainer? Wouldn't it be just fair for the other classes to get it from the trainers as well?<br />
<br />
And for the IV -&gt; BL - No no no no... Well, guess it's somewhat fair, but it's gimping Frost PvE DPS, which was already o so poor (Yes, you still have a 20% haste bonus, but on 10 minute cooldown, which Shaman's can provide as well).<br />
<br />
I personally don't really mind it coming only with Shamans, but I just don't see the reason why people are crying over it when it is getting balanced out, like you need it for a guaranteed raid spot. I know more than enough Shamans who just get their spot because they're nice and skilled players.<br />

<br />
Well yeah, (that wasn't really the point I was making, but ok) but that isn't really fair now is it? They can't spec in more than two raid buffs if they want to do DPS or tank something (I don't even know if they can if they wanted to, can't acces the talent calculator from where I am now, and don't know the tree by heart) - HoW + Abominable Might / Icy Talons, like there aren't more classes with two buffs. They don't do more dps than other classes. They don't make better tanks (Tanks are pretty much balanced out at the moment). It is stupid for those people to come back to play once they get nerfed more. It just makes no sense, to say you would start playing once your class is better than the others. (I am aware, though, that you can get consumables for most good buffs, I know it would be more balanced if this where the case for all buffs - But that would just discard the need for any particular raid setup at all, so I don't see this happening soon.)<br />

(The DK was just a example for me - because as far as I am concerned they are just on the same level with the other classes and there is no more reason for people to cry for nerfs endlessly, could have imagined if you did in 3.0.9, given, they where just overpowered then. But now, 3.2, there is just no reason for crying what so ever.)</div></div><hr />
