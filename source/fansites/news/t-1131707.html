As a followup to yesterday's post, these are the items we have come across on the Black Market Auction House so far. Mounts seem to start at 20,000 gold, Armor at 10,000 gold, Pets at 10,000 gold, and Misc items at 10,000 - 15,000 gold. <br />
<br />
The auctions last for 24 hours or more and the current bid cap is 214,748 gold. This cap could be increased in the future, just like the gold limit was increased. After winning, another item is not added to the auction house immediately. The number of items that are up for auction is not the same across all servers. There is no way to tell if these are placeholder items or not, so please wait for an official announcement before providing feedback!<br />

Diablo III Information Recap<br />
With a little over one day to go, now is the best time to catch up on all the information out there about Diablo III that you might have missed! Our friends over at Diablofans (http://www.diablofans.com/) have been hard at work putting this massive recap together. Even if you know all about the game, there can easily be Blizzcon videos, trailers, pictures or many other things you may not have seen or have forgotten about!<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this could be a bit of a spoiler to some. For example the final boss of the game (http://www.diablofans.com/news/863-it-ends-with-diablo/page__st__40/) was announced last year in an official interview. Information like that is placed without spoiler warnings. Monster Affixes is also listed in the Monster section. Other than that, any spoilers require you to click on a picture to see.<br />
<br />
<br />
Diablo III - The Classes<br />
Diablo III has only one returning class type - the Barbarian. The other four are new to Diablo III. Click the pictures below to get loads of information on each, such as facts, lore, rune skills, and other videos!<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Diablo III - The Followers<br />
The Followers are companions to the player which help him in combat with different skills and buffs. In their article you can find details about their stats, equipment, dialogue and videos for each.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.diablofans.com/uploads/gallery/album_147/gallery_37842_147_25147.jpg (http://www.diablofans.com/topic/41272-recap-diablo-iii-followers/)<br />
<br />
<br />
Diablo III - The World<br />
Same as the previous game, Diablo III will have 4 acts. The worlds are randomized just as Diablo II was with the exception of towns and major quest locations. Clicking on the areas will give you information on acts, locations, and level generation. Monsters will give you what we currently know about monsters, affixes and bosses. Quests will explain Blizzard's intentions with the questing system and give a summery of all known quests so far.<br />

<br />
Diablo III - Items and the Auction House<br />
Diablo III introduces a feature which hasn't been explored much in the gaming world - a Real Money Auction house, where you can buy and sell items from the game for real currency. Apart from that is a standard Gold Auction House. They have also included a huge summary of information about the Items in the game.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Diablo III - Game systems and Modes<br />
Diablo III has many core changes from Diablo II. Skill and Runes particularly have had many changes made quite recently, which might have confused a lot of people. This can be fixed in the Skill and Runes article. Crafting is almost entirely new to the franchise. Magic Find includes lots of information about the popular stat and the new buff called Nephalem Valor. There is also major info on Multiplayer, PvP, Difficulties and the Hardcore mode.<br />

<br />
<br />
Diablo III - Story and Achievements<br />
There is also a small summary of the Diablo's storyline so far, plus lots of videos of all cinematics and information about books involved with the game. Also an important note, unlike the other articles the achievements is not so much a recap, as it is a FULL LIST, so SPOILER WARNING<br />
<br />

<br />
It would seem odd to make them placeholders. If Blizzard just wanted to test placeholders, they could've easily done that, putting grey/green items and basic mounts in there. Why put ridiculously rare items or items that have been removed from the game otherwise only to take them out later?<br />
<br />
Also, things that are placeholders typically get a (PH) marking somewhere.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorien</div><div class="date">2012-05-13, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Making items less rare = terrible. T3 Replicas will create a lot of sad pandas. I think this is stupid personally. Anyone who played back then worked hard for that gear.<br />
<br />
Except for the loads of people that wish they had access T3, which far outnumbers the crowd that is all smug about having it. It wasn't especially prestigious, hard to get, or anything like that. Other tiers remain - that's the only thing that sets T3 apart. Silly, really.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyghost</div><div class="date">2012-05-13, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel that quite a few of those items are placeholders. What I'm seeing here so far is a potential money sink for those who have interest in gathering rare-ish items but don't want to go through the effort of farming an old raid/instance repeatedly to get those things.<br />
<br />
And of course, for those who don't want to have to outbid someone with potentially millions of gold to throw around there's the option of still being able to get those things the 'normal' way.<br />
<br />
I see no problem with this at all, or this being a &quot;now anyone can get Ashes of A'lar!!&quot; problem... cause really, right now ANYONE can get Ashes of A'lar, provided they substantially outlevel The Eye and have 5 friends to run the raid with.<br />
<br />
ammendum: What I might WORRY about, though, is the Teir 1/2 gear sitting there being placeholders for what would be teir 14 pieces. While I see this being a great opportunity for a money sink for vanity items, I don't want to see progression gear on this thing, ever.<br />
<br />
another ammendum: took a harder look, I see it's now Teir 3 items. That makes a bit more sense. Most people who had collected Teir 3 have probably quit the game ages ago. No sense in hiding one of the best teir sets from the game populace that's happy and willing to wear it for cosmetic reasons.</div></div><hr />

It's more then just loot that should be obtained by anyone in the game, it shows classic raiders which 90% of the players don't exist anymore. It's something more of a heirloom obtained by back in the day that no one can get anymore. New players shouldn't QQ about not being able to get it since they didn't even know about it.<br />
<br />
I know some people agree and some disagree just if this goes to live expect the rich to get bored and quit the game and people who have it already will most likely stop playing MoP.</div></div><hr />

This is really the best gold sink they could of possibly done. With all the moves bliz has announced and is making for mop just out of people i know there is around 100 returning to the game as they won't be locked into one toon by mounts pets achievements and time, and 1 person that i know is whining that they are gonna quit. Bliz is really stepping it up with mop hope they continue to deliver</div></div><hr />

There's an excellent chance that the vast majority of people who actually have T3 and are still playing are actually people who farmed Naxx for it during TBC. Worth remembering that little fact.</div></div><hr />

This is the opposite of gold selling, as this is designed to remove mass amounts of gold from the game's economy in chunks of hundreds of thousands.</div></div><hr />

I know, seriously. Blizzard should totally just remove gold altogether...why should some rich jerk be able to just go a buy ore when you have to sweat out mining it? Why should some rich punk be able to go buy epic gems when you have to beat a Dragon Soul boss? Gold is and has always been a corruption in an MMO that prides itself on fairness. <br />

its funny because if gold was gone casuals would cry so much it you would see 300 threads in an hour. just because someone has gold doesnt make them a jerk actually. Im worried about the people who sweat when their mining in a video game, i think they should see a hospital because thats not healthy at all.<br />
If gold wasnt there everyone would farm. And then the crying of i cant play for __ hours a day to farm.<br />

Gold are very easy to make.<br />
<br />
I am JC and LW, I am not exactly gonna tell you what I make, but it all involve buying the mats on AH with a good price, craft/cut them, and sell them for at least a few hundred gold profit a piece, and you can sell many in a day, you can easily make 20k a week, and i am sitting on nearly 200k gold.<br />
<br />
Why do we buy the ore? Cause you are selling it in a price that we can use your ore to turn into something else and make profit out of it. You got that gem from DS boss? I bought it and cut it and make nearly 200-300g profit on 1 gem, that is why.<br />

As a gold sink, the idea is brilliant; as a way for players to obtain items that were removed for really no reason, it falls short.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sucks that they are totally giving the vets a big FU, but any of the ones still around are probably still around for all the wrong reasons.<br />
<br />
So they should appease the &quot;veterans&quot; of the game by keeping content from the majority of the playerbase, even though most of the &quot;veterans&quot; are no longer around?<br />

<br />
I agree wholeheartedly. Content should not be removed to allow players to hold their accomplishments over the heads of others; if you would like to show off what you can earn, please clear current content and leave the challenges of the past for the masses to enjoy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ashes of Al'ar off BMAH should not give you a feat of strength since you didn't earn it, you bought it.<br />
<br />
I can pay a group of individuals to kill Kael'thas for me on my level 70 alt and &quot;earn it,&quot; the fact that it can be obtained through means that does not require killing a raid boss doesn't mean it is less of an achievement. The only things that changed are that it is now a &quot;guaranteed drop&quot; and that the bidding is open to a larger number of people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it is a pretty worthless mount. I actually got it by luck. I have no clue who has it on my server and I doubt anyone in the world knows I have it because I almost never use it.<br />
<br />
I will say this, I love the BM AH.. the only thing I hope is that the auctions last a week, or at least 3-4 days so that the price gets bid really high and there aren´t a ton of items entering the game. Really, Ashes is easily farmable, and will be faceroll fast when we are 90. Adding 52 (one per week) is not that big of a deal since there will probably be hundreds added from farming.<br />
<br />
I think it is a great idea even though I have a ton of mounts and almost all the pets.</div></div><hr />

If you raid that doesnt mean you have gold, like c'mon dude. 2nd of all they didnt even say whats going to be sold, for all you know your bitching can be for nothing and ashes was never going to be there, Unless im wrong find me a blue post saying you can buy every blue mount in the game from BM while you spend 4years waiting. Also feats of strength dont mean you earned it, because here, I can go farm sethekk halls and get a mount drop, Oh i spent 5mins and it was my first drop, I surely earned it.

It's not hard, but it can take a lot of time.<br />
<br />
- Prospecting/Milling is time-consuming.<br />
- Posting large numbers of items on the AH takes time. If you have to relist several times per day because you've been undercut, it adds up.<br />
- Emptying the mailbox takes several minutes.<br />

Altogether it's easy to spend 2-3 hours daily, depending on how much effort you want to put in.</div></div><hr />

That is, the amount of gold leaving the economy in the form of payments on the black market AH will be proportional to what people are willing to spend to get these rare items. Which in turn is proportional to the size of gold reserves in the economy. Which you have probably noticed has been growing exponentially year after year.<br />
<br />

Well this website is largely devoted to WoW, a game that Bliz brought us and has continued to work on for many years. I'd be hard pressed to understand how Bliz isn't great for all that they have accomplished. You clearly enjoy their work. That doesn't mean that every game design they make will suit your needs and preferences, but as a whole they have done very well for themselves, and for their massive following.<br />
<br />
I don't see a problem with the BM auction house. I do, however, think that it would be a mistake to make absolutely everything accessible, and agree that some items should be left to veterans simply as a thank you and trophy for continuing to play. I lost my veteran status when I quit wow for a couple of expansions after Vanilla, but I would be delighted to still have some collectors items from back in the day. It would be a shame if they lost their unique status.<br />
<br />
I don't feel strongly about it, but I can see where people are coming from, but it really is too early to get so worked up about this. There is a lot of missing information, and many changes to come.</div></div><hr />

Sentences. Are. Your. Friend.<br />
<br />
You are (with all of the other whiners) falling into the &quot;I'm a special snowflake.&quot; syndrome --over a mount. Yet, and here's the point that you can't argue around, kudos will go to people raiding current tiers and from Armory checks (inc. date checks on Achievements). Mounts from past tiers -who cares? It's all /faceroll these days and RNG when it comes to the loot.<br />
<br />
The Blackmarket AH exists for people with the resources. Grinds exist for people with the time. You. Both. Coexist. <br />
<br />
It should also be mentioned that (as of yet) we have no idea of how frequent items like Ashes of Alar will appear on the Blackmarket AH. It might be a once a month thing. Secondly, with mounts becoming Battle net wide you will see a lot more 'rare' mounts flying around Azeroth --making your *pretty little snowflake* syndrome even less valid.<br />
<br />
PS -can't you whiners learn to spell!? Learn the difference (for once!) between &quot;you're&quot; and &quot;your&quot;, jeez!</div></div><hr />

If they really have to say &quot;your purchasing an item not the gold blah blah blah&quot; Put in the blizzard store a grey item for 20 bucks that vendors for 20k. As long as prices are the same i guarantee people would by gold from bliz rather than 3rd party sellers. You are not buying anything with money that affects the actual playing of the game, just the looks of the game. The precedent has been set in online games across the internet, time for blizzard to do it to.</div></div><hr />

However it can boost the (ill)egal goldselling for the extremely rare and/or omfg looks kewl stuff..ofc it`s depends on player (i myself never did/shall pay for virtual money which is exist only in a really limited virtual world and basically worth less than nothing)<br />
I think the idea is basically good, but to make rare stuff common even if it`s outdated stuff....hmm-hmm...The special snowflake syndrome is a helping sentence for the natural born losers...Not everbody is equal, that`s fking obvious and yes, if some1 devoted his/her life, time, energy and other resources to obtain something, then the rest can be jealous or start to whine but still...better to stfu (same like in the sports or basically everywhere in the real life..not everybody entitled to go for the cup and absolutely not everybody should win it...in the wow it`s a bit more simplier as more than 1 winner could be -but there is always a first one-)<br />

<br />
to the point of the BM ah, all of you little whiny bastards complaining about how &quot;ppl who have this earned it&quot; crap need to realize that nothing along the lines of what was mentioned in the BM AH list of items is &quot;earned&quot; it was simply time investments. t3 is the ONLY tier that was removed from the game, does that mean it is somehow super extra awesome special? no, t2 also took work to get at the time and yet i can go right now and get it from those raids. the same goes for each and every other tier, also ALL of these tiers are now outdated and only exists now for transmog, how many ppl who actually got t3 kept it? many ppl just vendored or DE'd their shit. so blizz adding a way for a very few ppl to bid on those items 1 at a time? i really dont see how that is a problem at all. i could go farm TK a bunch and eventually i will also have an ashes, come mop i could form small groups and farm the DW drake too, hell i have seen 3 drop so far just from weekly clearing it. also all of these items will continue to be rare, its not like there will all the sudden be 2000 more ashes on each server, there 1 up for bid per auction, not a hundred, 1 and at the very least that 1 mount per day? maybe even longer, we dont know yet, but with all the multitudes of mounts being added to the game with MoP i really couldnt care less who has an ashes, and with account wide mounts i care even less than that. so just shut up and be happy that with the BM AH all the rich ass ppl who make certain AH markets overpriced might not be able to anymore, MAYBE the cost of things might become a bit more reasonable.</div></div><hr />

The reason is simple and already used in the past - there needs to be gold sink hole so there's no hyper inflation. At the end of TBC Blizz released epic bags that were expensive at the time. Then in Wrath there were chopper parts that kept price at specified level. Same thing in Cata with Vial. Recently there were many more sink holes added - glyph removal dusts, transmog, reforge, void storage. All the things where gold goes into nothingness after transaction. Now this Black Market Auction House is a brilliant - Blizz can sink millions by simply posting a mount. I really like the idea because it will help to balance economy A LOT by removing surplus amount of gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our guild leader got hacked about a year ago, transferred with a ton of money to another server. After the restoration, the GM wasn't supposed to, but informed our GM that the other party who was on the other end of the gold transaction would have &quot;proper action&quot; taken upon the account for gold buying.<br />
<br />
A lot of bought gold is from hacked accounts, and there's no way to tell if the gold you're buying was &quot;legitimately&quot; obtained or hacked, and you can bet that you're going to be tracked down if you buy gold from a hacked account.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Translation: If people play for reasons I don't like, they are wrong.<br />
<br />
I know people still around that actively raid that were raiding in classic. They still love every bit of the game. I played since classic, but wasn't max level until Wrath (not playing seriously, various hiatuses e.g. Deployment) with entry level raiding then, and serious raiding all through Cata. Throughout my experiences, I have not found anything in the game I hate. The closest thing is fishing with archaeology not far off. I look at people on the forums and in other websites complaining and whining and quitting over the silliest of things. All I see are children or just adults with very little patience. Maybe some of them are actually mature, but are making a big scene about one reason to leave in order to make themselves believe they need to leave for other real reasons.<br />
<br />
All in all, this is a wonderful game, inside and out. It saddens me that people leave for reasons other than no money, life changes, and general boredom. Leaving isn't going to force Blizzard to reverse that insignificant nerf and they aren't going to get rid of Pandaren. Seriously, people who complain about pandas are just childish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am JC and LW, I am not exactly gonna tell you what I make, but it all involve buying the mats on AH with a good price, craft/cut them, and sell them for at least a few hundred gold profit a piece, and you can sell many in a day, you can easily make 20k a week, and i am sitting on nearly 200k gold.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gold is easy to make - as long as only a few does it the way you describe. Gold is not being conjured up from air when your gems sell on the AH. It is because other players DO NOT PLAY THE AH or craft it that you can make any profit at all. The day &quot;the masses&quot; join you in what you do, the profits will drop to zero or even less (due to the AH % cut).<br />
<br />
I keeep seeing people proclaim this &quot;cure for all&quot; over and over. It isn't a cure for all. By definition, only a few can do this - and their profit is dependent on the majority doing dailies, running dungeons etc, and then spending their hard earned gold on gems that you provide. If they started doing like you, your profits would disappear and you would have to go out and grind dailies like the majority.<br />

When we are talking about inflation in game, yes, it is not about the merch in AH; as you have said, it doesnt generate new supply of money but a simple redistribution of money.<br />

there is no such thing as &quot;no cap&quot; in computers. There is always a cap, for technical reasons. Pretty sure the cap is not there because Blizz felt they needed a cap, but because gold amounts are limited to a certain number of bits of data. No doubt they will raise it, but it may be technically messy.</div></div><hr />

Well that cap on the AH is what the gold cap used to be, it wasn't always 1million gold, they will probably change it, but honestly I don't see the point. It's not like everyone on a server has that much gold. If they do, not all of them are willing to pay that much. If they are, not all of those people are going to be stalking the black market. If they are, not all of those people are going to want the same item as you.<br />

<br />
The best part; this will fix the insane gold prices on things at normal AH, because this is the biggest gold sink ever invented. They will remove loads and loads of gold from the game by doing this, and then the market will be balanced again.<br />
<br />
And to all you &quot;special snowflakes&quot;, grow up. It's just vanity items, I had t3 back in Vanilla. Got hacked and lost the account and everything on it. I wish I had t3 on my pala now for transmog, but I don't because of that incident several years back (Can't even remember why Blizz decided to not give me back my account, think I was stupid and used a BG Bot in Vanilla once or twice). Now if I decide I want to spend 200k on each t3 piece to get this look I can get it. (Thats a total of about 800-1000k gold to get it all)<br />
<br />
Is it still hard to believe that most people will be &quot;special snowflakes&quot; even after this BM AH comes? Not many people are willing to spend that insane amounts of gold to look special.<br />

O'rly? Naxx60 @ 70 was walk in a park. My guild did it every week. We got 3 or 4 atieshes and countless t3 full sets.<br />
<br />
Just because something was removed for lore reasons doesn't make it &quot;OMG awesome and unique&quot;. Be glad it's BMAH and not lvl60 token drops in lvl 80 naxx /muahahaha.</div></div><hr />

I remember the original being a real b*tch even with TBC, including the attument<br />
<br />
*Cough*t7 came in WotLK, aka lvl 80*cough*<br />

Alot of people farmed Naxx60 with lvl 70 raids to get those items. ALOT, atleast on my server.</div></div><hr />

Not EVERYONE can afford to spend 200-300 000 gold on something you don't need. The bids will be crazy, and going through the roof. <br />
<br />
The best part; this will fix the insane gold prices on things at normal AH, because this is the biggest gold sink ever invented. They will remove loads and loads of gold from the game by doing this, and then the market will be balanced again.<br />
<br />
<br />
I kmow at least 5 people near gold cap and numerous with over 100k gold including myself.<br />

And to all you &quot;special snowflakes&quot;, grow up. It's just vanity items, I had t3 back in Vanilla. Got hacked and lost the account and everything on it.<br />
Your post is full of truth.<br />
<br />
And since most of you are against &quot;special snowflake&quot; (most of which have nothing unique) why not putting infinite Ashes for 1000g since there is no need for anyone to have something rare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we really want to undermine rare items we should just put them for sale at a flat low price. As it is, I can't help but feel people are being slightly hypocritical. Its just snowflakes vs. would be snowflakes.<br />
<br />
Yet by making them widely available, we will just end up devaluing the symbolic value placed on these items and ensure no one feels like special snowflakes by having them. Does that mean everyone wins? Or rather, does that mean everyone loses? :P</div></div><hr />

While there is a huge difference between real life, and &quot;wow life&quot;, the argument is the same. And yes, you can go out to a costume shop or army PX and buy those same medals and pretend to be a war veteran IRL, but you'll also be treated like a PoS for doing that (also illegal IRL).<br />

A tour of duty in Afghanistan or Iraq is no more difficult today than Vietnam was then. That's the first point at which your argument falls completely apart. Secondly, you can go, as you said, and buy a replica medal if that's what you want to do. Thirdly, and this is the important one, which you did touch upon yourself: This is not real life. Nobody died raiding Naxx and it is of no importance to anyone that you went there, so your comparison holds no water.

The only thing you did to get them when Naxx40 was current was play more than the average person. Nothing more.<br />
Those of you that got it at level 70 could pretty much just walk through Naxx40 to get it. There is nothing special about T3 items really.<br />
<br />
I didn't raid in Vanilla and didn't get any T3 items. Now, I don't even want them. T3 isn't even that good looking for most classes. As a hunter, I'll gladly give it a miss.<br />

Removing money from circulation won't increase prices, it will decrease prices. You are implying that if we burned money in the US, it would could INFLATION? Printing money causes inflation, so burning money causes deflation. I don't see how essentially deleting gold out of the rich's hands is going to hurt the economy.

peoples that have farmed outdated contents for a mount haven't &quot;worked hard&quot; and so aren't in the position to complain, only those that have obtained it when tk was current have the right to complain; to be fair that mount should have been retired when tbc ended in the same way they removed the mata drakes from naxx10/25.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it were me, I would NOT put items that are CURRENTLY obtainable in game on the BMAH. Instead, put TCG items on there exclusively. I see a lot of people complaining about not wanting to spend real money for such cool items, mounts, pets so putting majority TCG items on the BMAH seems like a good idea to quiet that complaint down. Instead, (without knowing the official items on the BMAH ofc) we will have a lot of people who are disappointed that things they took months or years to farm can now be bought in a day (in my case, it would be Raven Lord, taking me 2 years to finally get to drop).<br />
<br />
To those saying &quot;Well it's not a feat anyway because you didn't get it current, n00b&quot;, I would have to tell you to shove it. The time spent on anything in game makes it so much more valuable to a person whether earned in current content or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main thing keeping it rare was that it was a weekly lockout that require 5+ people (back in WotLK) effectively making it a about 5 years worth of farming (2% drop rate with 5 people to roll.) Being able to solo knocks it down to 50 weeks worth of lockouts. Having mounts go account-wide now gives someone multiple attempts per week depending on the number of 85's.<br />
<br />
Ony's mount is still rare for the same reason as Ash'es was; weekly lockout with many classes either unable to solo or still quite difficult to solo.<br />
<br />
BTW, I think this is a great addition to the game both as a real gold sink (unless you count the disenchant-able FL rep items) and gives players another way to access unattainable or hard to obtain items (I'm expecting the old ZG mounts to come back this way as well - looking forward to more 'special snowflake QQ'ers') without opening the floodgates (by being able to limit the amount sold.)</div></div><hr />

It's not like these rare mounts are going to become super common now. We have no idea how often the really rare stuff will pop up on the BMAH? If they posted one Ashes a month or one every two months for the busier servers, that's 6-12 more out there per year. That is not the definition of something becoming common. As for TCG stuff, lots of it already sells on the normal AH, so if Blizz chooses to post a few on the Black Market, whats the difference? It just changes where the gold goes.<br />
<br />
This is the best gold sink Blizzard has ever come up with. They can control how much gold they are taking out of the economy by controlling how often new stuff is put up on the black market. It's a stroke of pure brilliance. The only thing I'd bid ridiculous amounts for would be the Zulian Tiger. I farmed that thing forever and never got it, it's my unfinished business, and I will forgive Blizzard for removing it once I'm sitting on one.</div></div><hr />

It's not petty, it's sad how any achievement, any accomplishment, anything that makes you stand out from the rest of the players, anything that even remotely gives you that &quot;special&quot; feeling..

<br />
Yeah...<br />
<br />
Way to go spending weeks and weeks of farming high end raid content, way to go on saving up enough DKP to be on top of the batch, or getting a lucky roll,. or investing years of your life into helping a guild stay on top of the game only to have that waved aside as if it meant nothing.<br />
<br />
For a lot of veterans these kind of updates are just further enforcing the lack of interest in returning to the game.<br />
Because, quite simply put, whatever you might &quot;achieve&quot;, it won't mean anything in a few months from now.<br />
And that, sadly is the way the game has been &quot;evolving&quot; since Activision has taken control of it.<br />
<br />
Ofc, some nice content has been added, but high end raids nowadays aren't really even that special anymore. <br />
Raid finder, normal mode, hard mode, 10 man raids,.<br />

<br />
You hven't played recently. The end of the super rare mounts has already come. Most rare mounts can be gotten easily now through solo/2man. Or even making pugs and reserve the mount for 100kish(Yogg+0, LK25hc). And mounts like Ragnaros and Deathwing are already being sold for 100-200k. So the super rare mounts ended 2 years ago. The black market isn't gonna harm anything. And btw, farming 500k gold to bid on a mount takes longer than 1-2 hours a week doing yogg+0. Or 100-200k to buy ashes than solo on 11 chars(in MoP) every week that takes no time to clear. Ashes got 2% drop chance, which means alot of people are gonna see it drop anyways in TK in MoP. Probably 5-10 people on each server every week.<br />

<br />
You don't seem to understand this feature along other people lacking common sense, or healthy braincells.<br />
<br />
Here is how it works:<br />
<br />
There will probably be 10-20 different mounts available through Black market, and only 1 at max at any time. Lets assume there will be 1 ever week, than we're talking 4 mounts a month and 44 mounts a year. You might think (Woah, 44 mounts?! thats alot) Well no, its not. You see if the mounts are 20, than there will be 2 of each mount a year. And on most servers there is atleast 1 drop of each mount a week. Plus farming the gold to buy that specific mount will take alot longer than to farm the raids over lets say, 50 times to get it to drop, assuming you're not &quot;lucky&quot; and not unlucky.<br />

You really worked hard on your ashes, I mean soloing Kael'thas or 2manning in Cata is so HARD BRO! Its like WTF, CANT...KILL..HIM...MUST...NEED....25....PEOPLE... no you know what? The people that would use 200k on ashes deserve it just as much as you. They wasted more time getting the 200k, they probably wasted lots of time on farming the mount(yeah RNG isnt on everyone's side). So they decided to stop relying on RNG and use their gold. I have ashes, and I don't mind it being on the auction house every month going for 100-200k, you know what? I don't even care even just alittle bit. It just shows how you people with special snowflake syndrome have big problems. PS you must be on a REALLY low populated server, because damn, I see like 5 ashes in orgrimmar everytime im there... -.-</div></div><hr />

I've been playing since Vanilla and have been farming mounts since I was at max level. I have 9 level 85's now and have yet to get Rivendare's mount, Anzu, Ashes, the Kara mount, Onyxia mount, etc etc etc. I have NEVER seen any of these drop once and have raided during the times their instances/raids were current content.<br />
<br />
I've put the time and effort in. I'd rather just use the gold I've earned over that time to try and win one via AH.</div></div><hr />

Now they have officially screwed over the great aspect of farming and collecting rare mounts, pets and etc. True they could just be placeholders, but this truly is the start of things to make everything easier for people to get. I've been playing since 2004 and am an avid mount collector, I put so much time and energy into collecting certain rare things, Ashes of Alar being one of them, to just see it handed over to people with gold, it makes me angry. Let me just say, its so easy to earn gold in WoW. You people who declared have put time in but havent received a mount, well here ya go, you just got all you wanted without anymore effort, EVER AGAIN. Fucking blizzard truly ruining the game and the last bit of looking original in it. If this comes to pass, I will cancel my account and never look back. Might as well just put all sorts of rare mounts on the Blizzard Store and make a killing their too. God the people whining how this is fair and just, you guys truly just want to be spoon fed. Well congrats, you just keep getting it. Time to look for something else to play that actually offers a challenge. Fucking collected 155 mounts so far and now its all being served on a fucking golden platter to idiots that either barely do anything in game or just collect gold. Flame away all you spoon fed babies, Flame away.</div></div><hr />

It's not like you are able to buy an Ashes (or whatever rare mount) for a set amount of gold. You still have to outbid everyone else.<br />
Like you said, 'its so easy to earn gold in WoW' so it's reasonable to think only the EXTREMELY rich (gold cap+) will even be able to participate in the market for the sought after items.<br />
<br />
And please, if you have been an avid collector since '04, please go ahead and link your armory with Old School ride or Oct 2008 achievement dates for either ZG mounts, Ashes, Baron's, Anzu, Amani Warbear and/or Midnight. Or are you just another wannabe special snowflake like Mexy.</div></div><hr />

You do know that if you want to buy the whole t3 set you have to spend about 1 000 000g? (Thats one million.) How many of your friends got that?<br />
<br />
This gold sink is awesome, the rich bastards gets a way to get rid of all the gold, those who miss like 1 tier piece of t3 gets that last one (A friend of mine is missing shoulders...), and lets not forget those who have farmed the same raids since release to get that one special mount, but the RNG Gods hate the shit out of him...?<br />
<br />
Well done Blizz, this was needed!<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and a last note: Buying mounts isn't something new, I see this daily &quot;/2 LFM TK Mount run, mount reserved but you will roll for 100k g&quot;. So what's the big fuzz? An IRL mate of me have been selling FL and DS mounts the last few weeks aswell with his guild and taking 3-500k gold for it.<br />
<br />
So stop whining you attention whores, I know for my self that I do not care about your flashy Ashes or t3 pieces, just vanity items anyway.</div></div><hr />

They lost one sale here. <br />

Likely anyone who's psyched on a RMAH is already a slave to blizzard and was gonna buy the game no matter what so I doubt they gained many sales from this terrible idea only people with delusionns that they will make any real profit by being a basement dwelling social outcast.</div></div><hr />

I'm psyched at being able to keep up in the game (gearwise) without having to spend all that time I did back in D2 (back when I had the luxury of time.)<br />
Hell, given it's been 10+ years, I'm will to bet that many former D2 players are in the same boat.</div></div><hr />

I don't see any item I'll want to buy, Ashes of alar aren't that awesome anymore, and if you have 10 characters, it will be easy to farm if mounts are &quot;account bound&quot;...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? Because you'll be able to farm them on 10 toons instead of just your main, then it gets transfered to all characters when you finally win the RNG. That makes these mounts about 10 tmes easier to get than they are now.<br />
<br />
Not only that, those that have these mounts already (Ashes, midnight, baron, etc) will have them on all of THEIR alts, so you'll see a lot more of them in SW / Org than you do at the moment. So yeh, even without this, stuff like Ashes and midnight are gonna be common in the new expac. This is just a much-needed gold sink.</div></div><hr />

Sure it makes you feel a bit less special when you're no longer the only one, but you know what? I have my memories of that hugely fun quest chain, and that's what really matters.<br />
<br />
Hell, the people who got their set from DMF probably put more time into it than I did. The quest chains were long but not THAT long. The same is actually true of a lot of these supposedly hard to obtain items and mounts. I mean, who is really putting in more effort? The guy who solos KT every single week for a year and a half for that 1% drop mount or me who turns up to a 1-night 8/8hm DS clear every week and eventually picks up the Handmaiden mount (which will almost certainly be 1% in MoP)? Had I been in a progression raiding guild in Wrath I probably would've gotten Invincible and Mimiron's Head at least as easily. A lot of supposedly exclusive things merely required you to be playing at a certain time in a progressed guild. That's no great personal achievement.<br />

<br />
The problem is that AH to me will only make the gold sellers market thrive even more as people buy the gold to get that one rare item that is for sale.<br />
<br />
GG Blizz make it even easier for the gold sellers to do their jobs.<br />
<br />
I thought Blizz wanted to combat the gold sellers not make their jobs even more lucrative or more likely to be used by players.</div></div><hr />

Money if perfect the way it is now, pretty pointless past 30ishk unless thats why you play the game. TIME &gt; MONEY. Money can easily be bought, but time spent endlessly farming Ashes cannot. <br />
<br />
This is a terrible idea IMO, I hope this gets scrapped before release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The starting bid is 10,000g. Then if enough bid on it it should be able to reach top bid wich is 200,000k. You're extremly lucky if you can get a tier piece for 10k gold. 200,000g is probably to much, but I wouldn't be suprised to see the tier piece reach about 100-150k the first times. (Those rich bastards that got 5-6 pieces and are missing a few to make a full set will spend ALOT to make that happen, atleast that's what I believe)</div></div><hr />
