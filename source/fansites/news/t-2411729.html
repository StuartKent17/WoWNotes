Spoilers ahead! The War of Thorns (https://wow.gamepedia.com/War_of_the_Thorns) is the quest chain that leads up to the Burning of Teldrassil. This content may be broken up into multiple weeks. <br />
<br />
<br />
The War of Thorns is a set of faction specific story quest lines that showcase the events leading up to the Burning of Teldrassil.<br />
Sylvanas believes the key to the Horde’s survival is making sure that they gain as much Azerite as possible and keep it from the Alliance. She wants to occupy Darnassus so they can’t use it as a hub to transport Azerite. The Night Elf army is currently in Silithus and so she wants to use this time to strike before they return.<br />
If you are Alliance you will first be sent to Astranaar to defend it from Horde assassins. If you are Horde you are sent there to assassinate guards with the blood elf rogue Lorash (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Lorash).<br />
The Horde is held back from advancing into Darkshore as Malfurion calls upon the wisps to create a wall. <br />
Sylvanas theorizes that the wisps can be distracted by causing chaos in the forest. This allows the Horde to push through the barrier. <br />
Sylvanas also has Saurfang take some troops and scale the mountains of Felwood to attack from the North.<br />
Both factions fight for control at strategic points involving dealing with crazed furbolgs and fighting each other. <br />
The Alliance and Horde then fight for control of the Azerite near the shoreline. <br />
Sylvanas confronts Malfurion but he blinds her and flees There is then a stalemate at Wildbend River between the Darnassian forces and Horde army.<br />
Both factions unlock the world quests in Darkshore after completing the quest chain up to this point. These world quests provide catch up gear, order hall resources, and gold.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
The Alliance heads to Darnassus to rally what little troops they have. <br />
The Horde reunites with Saurfang in Lor’danel (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Lor%27danel) after the wisp wall is taken out. <br />
The Horde takes out Alliance troops and Saurfang wants to spare as many civilians as possible.<br />
Finally, both factions’ player characters approach Malfurion who is confronting Sylvanas directly. It looks like he has the upper hand until Saurfang strikes a blow from behind. The orc realizes what he did was not honorable, but Sylvanas tries to convince him otherwise. She leaves him to kill Malfurion and heads to Darnassus. <br />
Tyrande flies in to rescue her husband and Saurfang says he doesn’t deserve to kill him as he struck without honor. She aims her bow at him, saying she will kill him if he tries to stop her from saving Malfurion, to which he tells her to take him and get far away from Darnassus. <br />
She does so and leaves the Alliance character to go make sure the occupation of the city is tolerable. Meanwhile, Horde characters head back to the conquered Lor’danel.<br />
There is a missing cutscene before Darnassus is in flames and the tree is burning. Horde characters talk to Sylvanas on the Darkshore coast who says she didn’t anticipate this, but it will cause the Alliance to retaliate.<br />
Meanwhile, Alliance players head to Darnassus to help Mia Greymane (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Mia_Greymane), Genn’s wife, with the evacuation. Greymane comes through a Stormwind Portal to convince his wife to leave with as many as possible. <br />
In the end, Alliance players return to Stormwind and Anduin confirms that peace can never be achieved with Sylvanas as warchief. <br />
Alliance players are rewarded with the Smoldering Reins of the Teldrassil Hippogryph (https://beta.wowdb.com/items/163127-smoldering-reins-of-the-teldrassil-hippogryph) while the Horde receives the War-Torn Reins of the Undercity Plaguebat (https://beta.wowdb.com/items/163128-war-torn-reins-of-the-undercity-plaguebat).<br />

I don't usually get saddened by a game, but this, the destruction of Auberdine and Ysera's death are the saddest things in this game's storyline. So much time spent in that place and it was the first place I saw when I started this game as a kid. In classic it was always one of my favourite zones in the game, sharing the top favourite with Winterspring. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
What kind of rubbish is this?<br />
<br />
Seriously, writers thought the Alliance would not retaliate if the tree hadn't burned, but Sylvanas' attempt at taking over Darnassus wouldn't?<br />
<br />
Blizzard writting, boys!<br />
<br />
yes? The horde attacking and taking control of a zone, killing off a faction leader may force the alliance into fear, but burning down the world tree the horde really didnt accomplish much other then take land, they didnt kill anyone important.<br />
so yes instead of the alliance broken with the loss of its leaders, it is now deadset on war.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It actually matters not who set the Teldrassil on fire - if the Horde wouldn't launch it's unprovoked attack,nothing of that would happen.So,no matter who actually set on fire,the Horde is 1/2 liable for it.</div></div><hr />

For me it has the same effect as Antoran Charhound (Though it kinda looks like an Antoran Charmonkey instead. I was weirded out by the long arms at first, but I grew to like them a little bit. <br />
As for plague bats, they're obviously based off the typical way of displaying gargoyles, it kinda makes sense they have arms. Doesn't make it look even a bit less weird, though. But for me, I think I can grow to tolerate those arms, as I did with my Charmonkey.</div></div><hr />

Legion invasions gave something more important: Experience. Blizzard confirm this won’t. I logged on for the Legion pre patch every day because I enjoyed using it to level alts.<br />

Obviously this is a concious choice by Blizzard. They just made leveling much more time demanding. Would make no sense at all to make an event that allowed you to level for free like in Legion pre patch.</div></div><hr />

What? Of course it was intended that they give experience. They tweaked it numerous times to make sure you couldn’t just AFK and get it. They wouldn’t tweak it if it was a bug. In the end they increased the exp per mob and decreased the completion exp.</div></div><hr />

no it was not intended, stated by blizzard themselves.<br />
1. it was supposed to give exp, but it was supposed to be more for &quot;low levels could compete and gain about the same much as if they were questing during that time.&quot;<br />
2. it gave insanely way too much exp.<br />
3. if it was what it would have exp wise, people trying to level would have done their best to avoid them, instead of ONLY leveling with them.</div></div><hr />

They didn’t nerf the experience. They changed how you obtained it but it remained the same throughout the event. That to me says that it isn’t a bug and it’s why the event was so loved.<br />

For the love of Fyora, are you literally arguing about when I called it a bat just to describe which one I was talking about? I am well aware it's not an actual bat, it's more of a gargoyle, which I believe I already expressed quite a few times by now. It's like saying &quot;That cat over there&quot; about a photo with tiger, wolf, bear and a hawk. People are well aware which one I meant and I'm well aware it's a tiger, not a house cat.</div></div><hr />

He didnt say they reduced the experience by 66% tho. He just said reduced. By all means that could be a buff to total accumulated experience since you get to do three of them instead of one</div></div><hr />

<br />
thing is as people tested it, they found it far less, and again yes you can do 3x more, but you are taking 3x longer for less exp, so yes you may have gained &quot;abit&quot; more exp, but it was over a MUCH longer period.<br />
also each gave actually less then they did before.<br />
https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17613131957<br />
it gaves 40-50k exp then after it started giving 12k meaning less then 1/3<br />
https://twitter.com/devolore/status/765617107933405184<br />
Lore even said this, before it was nerfed AGAIN one day later.<br />
but yes when lore said that, it was true, if you did them all you got more exp then before, but no where near enough <br />
for example<br />
before 1hour=100k exp<br />
after 3 hours=250k exp<br />
yes so you could get more exp from your &quot;daily invasions&quot; but the issue was you got less per hour.<br />
<br />
https://i.imgur.com/Nlg0IGQ.png<br />
this guy sorta put it well, yes there was more potential experiance, but experiance per hour dropped pretty hard.<br />
so before it was far more efficient for levleing lots of chars, while after you couldent really very well.<br />
<br />
oh yeah also trhis<br />
https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2049678-Legion-Invasions-XP-nerf<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So every four hours, we had two invasions.<br />
<br />
Now, every two hours, we get three invasions.<br />
<br />
XP has been reduced by half.<br />
<br />
So assuming, for calculation sake, that one old event was worth &quot;10&quot; xp. Every four hours, you would get 20 xp. (10x2)<br />
<br />
Now, it's worth 5. Every four hours, you get 6 events, so 6x5 is 30.<br />
<br />
So we could say the XP got boosted, not nerfed.<br />
This does it well, yes while it is an exp boost for total it is less exp per hour.<br />
<br />
for example you work a god that you make 20$ an hour but only work 8 hours a day (160$)<br />
you work a job that is 15$ an hour for 12 hours a day. (180$)<br />
so yes while the top one is less then the lower, what one do you prefer?<br />
What is more important, 20$ or 4 hours?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You got lesss per hour but you still got so much more then you would doing anything else that it was actually a buff to overall gain. ALso each invasion took like 5-10 minutes tops</div></div><hr />

ALso each invasion took like 5-10 minutes tops<br />
<br />
except that is not a buff to overall gain.<br />
because if you had 4 or 5 alts to level you NEVER had down time.<br />
so you had much more gains, it was very much a nerf, yes if you had 1 toon, and did not care about your time, yes it was an increase. but again look at the math above.<br />
<br />
<br />
before 10xp an hour-1 mission<br />
after 5 xp per hour-3 missions<br />
<br />
now lets say you had 12 hours to play a day.<br />
you could do 12x10=120<br />
or<br />
12x5=60<br />
so while yes if you have one toon you can get<br />
10x1=10<br />
or<br />
5x3=15<br />
then there is down time inbetween<br />
but if you had a bunch of alts THERE WAS NO DOWN TIME.<br />
<br />
again it was a drastic nerf to exp per minute, and even then the numbers were still wrong and even if you did all three it was less then the 2 or 1 before.<br />
<br />

<br />
yes but exp per hour was still much lower. it is the reason people level using invasions in legion during 7.2 because the exp per hour was MUCH higher then normal questing, but you only had 5 quests, so yes you could quest all day and get many more levels, but only having to do 45 minute of content for lal that exp.<br />
if you seriously think that this is not a nerf again<br />
20$ an hour job where you work 8 hours a day<br />
versus<br />
15$ an hour job where you work 12 hours a day<br />
you would seriously take the second job saying it is better?<br />

That’s not a nerf, they changed how you obtain the experience so you have to put more effort into it. That’s because people were AFK farming, not because it was a bug.<br />
<br />
again it was nerfed multiple times, and no they did not change how you earned it, you could afk all the way till the end, they just made it take LONGER to get that exp.</div></div><hr />

XP per hour might be lower but XP per day was higher since most people only used this system.<br />

This isnt a 12 hour a day job. Its 30-45 min of fast leveling if you want to do it.<br />

Presumably the quest chain itself will be, since it's part of the lead-in to BfA rather than an invasion-style one-time deal, as far as I understand it. Because if it is, it's a great idea to have a set of catch up gear you can get as part of the expansion opening for leveling future alts.</div></div><hr />

exp per day was more, but it required more time.<br />
1 invasion was 15 minutes plus travel time of easily 10-20 minutes.<br />
so yes you could get more per day, but you could also get more per day by just questing. its about the per hour, that is what is most important.</div></div><hr />

The funny part is when the tree is on fire she says something like &quot;didn't see this coming, well the Alliance will be pissed&quot;.

I like her character, for reasons I can't really explain i feel like. She was my favorite racial leader back in Vanilla and she still is. Maybe it's because I have always been a Horde fanboy at heart. Not the kind where I just hate the Alliance and anything about them just the Horde races appealed more to me. Now that I have played the game since launch I have payed more attention and I started to like Varian before he died and I like Velen quite a bit too.

*he got assbanged by SHADE of Xavius, S H A D E of Xavius*<br />
Shitty writing in the past doesn't excuse shitty writing in the future. I find Malfurion boring as shit, certainly prefer Sylvanas (and Saurfang more than either) but it's been pretty well established that he's one of the most powerful people in the world. Sylvanas is definitely powerful but like most rangers, warriors, rogues, etc; lore-wise they just don't stack up to the serious magic-users.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also I play horde because I like killing people (in game) and starting world wide wars, so suck my little belf weiner.<br />
Uhh... Ok.. Not sure if serious but if you are, you know the Horde was created to unite the downtrodden and fight for survival right? Garrosh was a nutjob for pushing us into war so we killed him for it. Sylvanas is going down the same path thanks to shitty writing, so we'll probably end up killing her for it too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Also before anyone says anything about me calling it shitty writing without providing an alternative or something, the answer to faction balance with characters like Malfurion is pretty obvious - remove him from the equation. It doesn't even make sense that Malfurion is the one setting a trap for the Horde, he's always been anti-conflict, even after the horde were accused over the death of Varian he said they should try to make peace... He should have been the one chilling in Stormwind while Tyrande was trying to outsmart Sylvanas/Saurfang.</div></div><hr />

urg now you make me want to go find it... But legit i think it was a &quot;this versus this&quot; thread, saying that sylvanas could have just insta killed anduin by screaming, disabling his casting and then just shooting him, aswell as with malfurion and many others like jaina, and khadgar.<br />
I think it all started with khadgar as i remember posting how he insta killed a dreadlord with a massive beam, and they were like &quot;yeah but she could just scream and disable khadgars spell then just kill him&quot;</div></div><hr />

The only exception would be Blacksmiths. The Fel Core Hound mount needs about 50 Blood of Sargeras to craft, which you can purchase with resources.<br />
I'd imagine the mounts will still be selling well in BFA. Maybe even going up in price when they become more scarce.</div></div><hr />

BS! The same thing goes for the alliance when you have Greymane!<br />

<br />
Before the storm shows this to be wrong, Greymane was present but did nothing at all, while Sylvanas did something of great evil because she was either jealous, or just plain evil.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't want to enter too much spoilers, but Greymane went from complete and utter hatred of all forsaken to coming to terms with at least one of them before the end, and likely would had come to terms with more, a complete change <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Greymane doesn't decide if we go to war or not, that falls on Anduin, Greymane would simply say something along the lines of &quot;WE CAN'T TRUST THEM, *Hump*&quot;<br />
