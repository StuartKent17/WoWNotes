<br />
We finally have the name of the first mounts rewarded for the Raids &amp; Dungeons achievements! The mount currently use the models below but they might change in the future, apparently the color of the Storm Drake is scheduled to change, and the Volcanic Stone Drake uses the regular Deepholm Dragon model, this might or might not be intended. (= Don't yell at me if something changes in the future, it's mean)<br />

Wrath of the Lich King released in China - Censorship<br />
Blizzard finally got the authorization to deploy Wrath of the Lich King on chinese servers, their version of the game is censored because of cultural reasons and 178.com (http://chinagame.178.com/201008/75942001505.html) has a nice collection of screenshots to compare the original and the chinese expansion. <br />

Beta - Recent Mount Hyjal Changes<br />
In the last patch we made some major changes to the way that Hyjal flows.<br />
<br />
The Good News: As you progress through the zone, you’ll no longer need to keep flying back and forth to the World Tree to notify Ysera of your progress.<br />
<br />
The Bad News: Beta players who were halfway through the quest chain when the patch hit will not have received proper credit for earlier quests, and won’t be able to progress.<br />
<br />
We’re sorry for the trouble but it’s all in the name of making a better game. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435287527/update-recent-mount-hyjal-changes/))<br />
<br />
Northrend leveling way too hard on beta<br />
Are we? Because I'm pretty sure nobody ever stated that as being the claim and I don't personally appreciate the comparison. Welcome to beta, where things you don't like happen with great frequency.<br />
<br />
As has been stated in the main thread, combat numbers are continuing to be evaluated. Feedback on Outland and Northrend are actually very much appreciated as the new numbers do reflect on those areas as well. It is highly likely that we will be bumping up experience gains in Northrend to match the increase(s) we made in Outland when Northrend launched. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435507233/feedback-levling-68-80-in-northrend-blows/))<br />
<br />
31 Points Talent<br />
We want you to get your 31 point talent and most of the time that's what players want too. When they skip that talent they feel, as you seem to express, that something is wrong with the talent, not that there is a really fun choice in another tree. So once it's a given that we want you to spend 31 points in the main tree, then spending points in another tree as you level is just going to force you to eventually respec to get that 31st point anyway. (Technically, you don't need the bottom-most talent -- you just need 31. But we still consider it a problem when you don't want that bottom talent for some reason.)

Furor<br />
We have actually swapped Furor (now in Feral) and Heart of the Wild (now in Resto). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435507837/location-of-furor-for-druids/))<br />

Restoration in raid<br />
Your buttons: Rejuv, Regrowth, Lifebloom, Nourish, Healing Touch, Wild Growth.<br />
Buttons you probably push in a raid: Rejuv, Wild Growth.*<br />
<br />
Solution 1: We add Regorge and Rejuke as new heals. You push Rejuv and Wild Growth.<br />
Solution 2: We get you to push Rejuv, Regrowth, Lifebloom, Nourish, Healing Touch and Wild Growth.<br />
<br />
In Solution 1, you get new heals and still only use 2. In Solution 2 you use 6 heals. I suppose we could posit a Solution 3, where you get 2 new heals and use 8 buttons, but since we can't even get you to Solution 2 yet, that seems quite ambitious.<br />
<br />
All of this belies the fact that there *are* new mechanics in your tree, even if there aren't new action buttons. Tree of Life and Efflorescence do things for which there is no current comparison.<br />
<br />
* - every time I say this, druids will respond &quot;Check my logs! I push all my buttons!&quot; The sad truth is you likely don't need to. You can be a very good druid with those two buttons. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435494961/druid-restoration-beta-pve-update/))<br />
<br />
Restoration in Icecrown Citadel<br />
We just don't think the data bear that out. I'm looking at a random parse for a heroic Icecrown 25 druid who healed 80% of his or her damage with Rejuv, 17.5% with Wild Growth and 2.3% with Swiftmend. That is literally 99% of healing, though I suppose you could be charitable and assume the Swiftmends did something with Regrowth. This result is very typical. Presumably this healer is no slouch, since he or she is handling the most challenging content in the game. You could argue I suppose that he or she would have been an even better healer with more buttons, but the fact is, the raid cleared the instance. This healer is not doing anything wrong. This healer figured out that ignoring those other buttons didn't really slow the group down much. We think that is a design flaw. If we saw, say the two-button druid healing Vault of Archavon and Marrowgar and the five-button druid healing heroic Sindragosa and Lich King, then it probably wouldn't be the kind of thing we were so aggro about. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435494961/druid-restoration-beta-pve-update/))<br />
<br />
But I don't like it when someone, especially as knowledgeable as Ghostcrawler, calls people bad for using a small number of abilities. <br />
I think some of you misinterpreted what I was saying.<br />
<br />
I said: We think druids are too effective when they only use a couple of spells. Several players called me on that saying they used all of their tools and only &quot;bad druids&quot; used two spells. I called them on that, saying that these so called &quot;bad druids&quot; were clearing every boss in the game, on heroic mode, using only two spells. So if they are truly the bad druids, there isn't enough separation between good and bad. More than likely, I think there aren't many bad druids beating LK 25 heroic, and that some druids are giving too much credit to the size of their toolbox when only a few tools are doing all the work.<br />
<br />
It doesn't really matter though, because if you like using more tools, you should like Cataclysm healing. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435494961/druid-restoration-beta-pve-update/))<br />

Long Arm of the Law / Pursuit of Justice stacking<br />
We generally don't stack movement speed increases and PoJ explicitly says that it doesn't stack, but the 30% is a very conservative number so we left ourselves room to bring that up. It's 45% in our current builds.<br />
<br />
Even if they don't stack, I think PoJ will be useful in a variety of situations and won't feel like a wasted talent. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435297016/clarification-on-laotl-please/))<br />

Tier 1 Enhancement<br />
Right. The problem with tier 1 Enhancement is you have Focused Strikes, which clearly is for Enhance and nobody else. Then you're left with Elemental Weapons, a good talent for all 3 specs, and Improved Shields, a good talent for Enhance and Resto. That leaves Elemental with only 3 points they want to spend in tier 1 and a strong desire to get to tier 2. But, as I said above, if Elemental did care about shields, then presumably they could care about Improved Shields.

<br />
Making Shaman fun<br />
Fun is obviously very important to us, but it's also a really difficult thing to talk about. I read these forums constantly, and it's pretty typical to see the class who had exciting changes a few weeks ago now bored of those and eager for new changes. The grass is greener mindset is huge around here, perhaps understandably since it's hard to stay in touch with the changes going on for all classes at once. When you drill down sometimes on what players are looking for to make their class fun for them, you often get a list of ideas that would be terribly overpowered or just not work in our game, or both. That doesn't mean it's not a goal. It just means that delivering what is fun for one player means something very different than what is fun for another player. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435296770/gc-any-12759-shaman-comments/))<br />
<br />
Fire Nova<br />
We'd like to downplay Fire Nova in lieu of Earthquake (in addition to Chain Lightning of course). We also agree that Fire Nova should be used for true AE situations and not against single targets. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435296770/gc-any-12759-shaman-comments/))<br />
<br />
Elemental Rotation<br />
We didn't set out with the goal of change for the sake of change though. Most of the new rotational abilities we've added were to fix problems with the class. Prot warriors for example are going to be hitting the same buttons they hit in LK because we think that works. Elemental is getting Unleashed Weapon (and Earthquake), and beyond that we think you have the right number of buttons to hit, so we're hesitant to cram a new button in there. Nor are we excited about giving you &quot;Super Duper Lightning Bolt&quot; that lets you take Lightning Bolt off your bar just for the sake of having a new button. I'd characterize the Elemental playstyle as closer to a mage, who isn't managing a ton of different nukes, but does have to react to what is happening in terms of procs, short cooldowns and movement. Lava Surge, Elemental Mastery and Unleashed Weapon are examples of those respectively.<br />
<br />
We'll definitely take the feedback under advisement though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435296770/gc-any-12759-shaman-comments/))<br />
<br />
Feral Spirit Scaling<br />
Feral Spirit should scale like all pets. (It doesn't yet). Losing Parry was a consequence of losing Spirit Weapons, but we'll give it back somewhere. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435296770/gc-any-12759-shaman-comments/))<br />
<br />
Thunderstorm<br />
I agree that Enhancement's choice at level 10 is transformative. I disagree that Resto similarly plays very differently at level 10. I also think you're downplaying Thunderstorm. Now you can Lightning Bolt and when a target gets closer to you, Thunderstorm them back and then Lightning Bolt them again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435296770/gc-any-12759-shaman-comments/))<br />
<br />
Unleash Weapon<br />
Elemental's range talent needs to affect Unleash Weapon too. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435296770/gc-any-12759-shaman-comments/))<br />

* Loremaster of Eastern Kingdoms and Loremaster of Kalimdor no longer requires you to complete a given amount of quests anymore. You now have to complete the achievements for each zone to get the Loremaster title.<br />
* All the WoW classic zones now have their own quests achievement: Arathi Highlands Quests, Badlands Quests, Blasted Lands Quests, Burning Steppes Quests, etc ... (Numbers are placeholders, obviously)&quot;<br />
<br />
That solves the question which has been on the forums many many times so far: what's gonna happen with Loremaster achievement? <br />
Good solution, makes it so much easier to see what still has to be done.<br />
<br />
Drakes look good :D!<br />
<br />
I agree on the drakes :D <br />
And im happy with the changes to the Loremaster :)<br />
Makes me wonder though... My Paladin had like 400 quests done in Eastern And Kalimdor, will these quests be filled in with the new achievements then? I mean will i get achievements for the areas ive already done or does it only count for new made characters ?</div></div><hr />

Full ICC plate repair is 110-120g. This will only go up even more in Cata. <br />
<br />
10 People paying 100g a repair means 1000 repairs to get achievement, so it's not a lot really. 500 repairs for 25 man raiding (assuming cloth pays less, but not much more less as cost increases with expac)<br />
Raiding Guilds will have this achievement within 4 months.</div></div><hr />

I believe that they are accomplished as a guild, so tracking them will be different than tracking your individual achievements. So when the Loot a million gold achievement is reached, every person in the guild will get it. In the same way, if you have someone in the guild hit 525 in their blacksmithing and mining, then those requirements for the Working as a Team achievement will be marked as finished for everyone.<br />
<br />
Whether or not achievements will stick when you leave a guild is a different story. It will be interesting to see, if someone has Shadowmourn, and they leave the guild, does the whole guild lose that part of the Legendary achievement?</div></div><hr />

Fact of the matter is they wouldnt. I looked at the screens, they arent missing out on much besides a few cosmetic skeletons here and there...

It's not illegal to say fuck on TV. I just watched True Blood, and it has its healthy dose of sex, violence and swearing. Most networks are private companies, and it is their decision to allow what manner of speech they want. If they want to censor swearing and sex and violence, then that's their legal right. Where it becomes a civil issue is when the censorship is mandated by the government. I don't know the whole story about the censorship of certain elements of WoW in China, but if they have to do it because it's government legal issue, then I don't think it's that unfair to cry foul.</div></div><hr />

On topic: It appears Glory of the Cataclysm Hero achievement will be like the current Champion of the Frozen Wastes (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/1658/champion-of-the-frozen-wastes/) achievement, needing all dungeon bosses. I also like the placeholder text on the Glory of the Cataclysm Raider, &quot;Complete every Cataclysm Raid achievement and at least 4 protodrakes of various flavors.&quot; I already have Cherry, Lime, and Rust flavored protodrakes. I suppose Blueberry would be the easiest next you might be able to solo H UP in Cataclysm.<br />

<br />
Reading Comprehension + Common Sense<br />
<br />
Its because cataclysm dungeon master (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4844/cataclysm-dungeonmaster/) is itself a meta, while dungeon hero isnt. If it was to standalone achievements sure, but it isn't.<br />
<br />
Its safer to assume that it will stay as is (in its completed form), rather then thinking it could involve previously unmentioned (No achievements mention anything about hard modes, nor has blizzard talk about them) variables.<br />
<br />
There isn't even any &quot;Heroic: X&quot; Dungeon achievements, (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4843/cataclysm-dungeon-hero/) is a standalone achievement requiring you to kill the final bosses.<br />
<br />
If your gonna argue that everything is a fucking placeholder, you could use the same flimsy logic to argue that they'll change it so you have to solo each heroic naked.....</div></div><hr />

As for the chinese special version...I don't live there, so I don't care. Even in cartoony games like Indiana Jones on the Amiga, swastikas were taken out, while in the movies they stay in. However films are and have been butchered for violence and even in Germany in FPS blood gets removed and humans replaced by robots. So it doesn't fit to be all high and mighty.<br />

As somebody else said, this continues into other westen societies like America wnere you have the most disgusting behaviour of people on shows like Jerry Springer, yet swearing of the mildest form gets censored. You can see people shoot their faces off when you are 12 on TV, but beware if an uncovered nipple appears. Violence - yes please, nakedness - oh noes call the police.</div></div><hr />

Any other achievements that are placeholders are significantly more obvious, and none of them link to specific achievements with specific requirements. Why go to all that trouble with a single placeholder meta ?</div></div><hr />

Honestly? I've played Postal II (I'm German), and for once I agree with my government to ban this game. This game is just sick and gives Peeps dumb Ideas. Yes they ban a lot that spouts red pixels around here (Our guys QQ as much about red pixels as U.S. guys QQ about naked flesh) and often it's unwarranted.

<br />
And if you're going to disagree with post you better disagree with the whole thing and explain why instead of taking a small part of it.<br />
<br />
I would hope that parents wouldn't let their kids play a game if it had a label saying it had nudity on it. Are you so dense to not realize this? If game had nudity it would not have the rating WoW would have? It would rather, instead of a Teen rating, have a Mature or Adult rating?</div></div><hr />

I think shaman in Wotlk gives the best idea what blizzard trys to do in cata. As a shaman it's not only chainhealspam - sure, on some fights it's important like some CH spam into the melee camp at twins/ToC, but as a shaman you're like a swiss knife. I can do AoE Heal, I can do fast, single heal, a good, instant hot, earthshield or a REALLY big heal for massive dmg like festergut need at p3 (going berserk on the tank).<br />
<br />
The bad shamaheal I know just spam CH and sometimes the hot, because of the relikt (dunno about the english names, playing the german version :P) - a good one does a fuckload of intelligent heal over the raidtime. If there is a mage, standing alone miles away from any other person, I hit small healing wave, because a CH will cost more mana, has more cast time and won't do anything to someone, because there's no one near him.<br />
<br />
I already getting wet for cata - 2x aoe heal, 3x single heal for any thing there could be, a heal buff for &quot;low health&quot; players etc. pp. ....<br />

It's part of the religion and culture. You are not allowed to make fun of the dead even in games. That means you can't have skeletons, skulls, zombies and other undeads of that sort of thing The dead have great respect from the living in china.<br />
<br />
Another thing that you're not allowed to depict in China: the general discomfort or possible depiction of death of any one of the national symbol/endangered/protected animals in China.<br />
<br />
That includes certain types of cranes and pandas. <br />
<br />
This essentially means that there will never be pandas or cranes that are killable/tameable in Chinese WoW, because that would be a digital depiction of said animals dying (even as your ally/pet). WoW isn't the only game that they forced this rule on, too. GuildWars nearly had to delay their first expansion because of China making a big deal about Cranes and Pandas in the game.<br />
<br />
I'm throwing this out there, as a possible explanation to why Pandaren haven't been shown in WoW yet even though there are a small handful of quests that vaguely reference them.<br />
<br />
edit: And also, for perspective, yanno how ultra-violent games get banned pretty frequently in European countries, Germany in particular? Guess what's NOT banned by them, for TV/commercials? Graphic depictions of sex. Imagine that, the complete opposite of the States where it's okay to show people burning to death or dying violently at the hands of a crazed killer, or even getting raped; but two people perpetuating the human race? BANNED.<br />
<br />
edit2: And Blizzard's bothering with having to make a censored version of the game because the MMO Game market in China is not something negligible by any stretch of the imagination. China is the largest country in the world, population-wise. They easily have ten times the size of market of the US/EU regions combined. So yes, they're going to work with their censorship rules to put out WoW for China.</div></div><hr />

I just don't get how GC can go on and on about how restoration druids only hit rejuvenation and wild growth. Its simply not true now, and I'm not sure that its ever been true. Lets just forget the fact that his very own post leaves out swiftmend and nature's swiftness (our two emergency healing skills). Sure, you can be the rejuvenation/wild growth caster in a 25 man, but that just means you are expecting someone else to do the real healing when you are keeping people from dieing, but if you want to actually heal then you are using all of your abilities (especially if you want to single target at all because then you are using glyph of nourish and keeping regrowth, rejuv, lifebloom stacked on the tank and casting nourish). I don't even know how he begins to think that druids can get away with spamming rejuvenation and wildgrowth and nothing else. We aren't discipline priests, we don't get shields to spam. We aren't holy priests we don't get a 6 second cool down instant smart heal. If all we use is our hots (especially in 10 man where you normally have 1 tank and healer and 1 raid healer) people are going to die.<br />
<br />
The problem with the parse that he looked at being from a H25M attempt means that there were most likely 5 other healers that were more than competent and in that situation the druid was destined to be the hot battery just healing people up that didn't need imediate attention. They also probably had amazing gear (which greatly helps with just casting hots). However, in the average situation you are lucky to have 2 good healers in a 25 man raid, and being one of them greatly increases the chance that people will actually stay alive.<br />

You only need to do every 5 man on heroic and normal :(<br />
<br />
Where do you get that idea? Chances are every single one of them has achievements you need to complete, and I know people that still don't have their red proto-drake. I personally don't have it because its not a 310% speed mount and I'm a druid, so I really never cared if I got it or not.<br />

I believe they have stated that if you have the Loremaster achievement then you will default by having the loremaster achievement.

Just like to start out by saying, your reading comprehension fails.<br />
<br />
Exact quote from http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4843/cataclysm-dungeon-hero/<br />
<br />
&quot;Defeat the final boss of each Cataclysm dungeon on Heroic Difficulty.&quot;, the requirements are even defeat X boss, no talk of a heroic &quot;mode&quot; or whatever.<br />
<br />
Your point? It doesn't come from the Dungeon Hero achievement. It comes from the Cataclysmic Hero achievement, and if you put your mouse over that achievement you will see it has 4 sub achievements, and one of them is most likely a new version of the WoTLK &quot;Glory of the Dungeon Hero.&quot;</div></div><hr />

We still consider it a problem when you don't want that bottom talent for some reason.<br />
your solution is this: you simply force people to skill the bottom talent. Even if there is somethig wrong with it people will not be able to skip it. Awesome.<br />
<br />
You ARE NOT forced to take the bottom talent. You are forced to take 31 talent points in the tree. If you want to skip the bottom talent go for it, but can you give actual examples of 31 point talents that are so horrible that they shouldn't be taken?</div></div><hr />

Yes they have the forsaken. They are just remodeled. They actually look better in China IMO.<br />

The paterns that have skeletons/skulls in them aren't normally as blatant and are normally more acceptable.<br />

LOLOLOLOLOLOL How long have you even been playing this game?!? If you had played it in vanilla or BC you would know that GC AND THE WHOLE BLIZZARD STAFF, do not cater to the top 1 or 2%, but have started, blatantly and obviously, catering towards the more casual players who play this game. Of course only a fraction of 1% of total guilds will kill LK on heroic 25. That's why its called HEROIC. Everyone can still experience the entirety of the game if you aren't a downsy mouth-breather, but no they wont let you faceroll through the final boss on heroic mode in an expansion. <br />
<br />
GC gets a bad rap because he is the one answering questions from a bunch of whiny punks who think their *idea* is right.<br />

I'm not the kind of people that complain about everything and i really liked dragon mounts back then when there were nether drakes and i really liked the proto drakes first too but seriously... Has EVERY goddamn reward mount got to be a dragon?<br />
It's kind of getting old now.<br />

Too true. The entitlement complex some people seem to have shows no boundaries. Demanding changes to be made to a beta version of a game under the threat of abandonment is just petty, and the reasoning behind it is equally weak.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't think of any good reason for this expansion to be different...especially since you're only adding 5 levels with this expansion and fewer zones.... first impression it gives is that the developers are being lazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first half of that argument is contradicted by the second and 3rd, as this expansion is already different due to it only raising the level cap by 5, and it having less 'new' zones as a result. There also seems to be more development time required to be put in to the other aspects of this expansion, such as the guild leveling system, dungeon tuning, the whole changes being made to healing etc. etc. The reintroduction of the learning curve outside of raids is going to take some getting used to for some people, I guess.</div></div><hr />

That includes the little things they add to make them slightly harder, like killing a boss in x amount of time or ensuring you do a specific thing in a specific phase.<br />

Exact quote from http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4843/cataclysm-dungeon-hero/<br />
<br />
&quot;Defeat the final boss of each Cataclysm dungeon on Heroic Difficulty.&quot;, the requirements are even defeat X boss, no talk of a heroic &quot;mode&quot; or whatever.<br />
<br />
Have you considered the fact that the dungeons are not complete yet? They know the end boss names for sure, that part of the meta is ready so there is no reason not to fill in that as the requirement. While redundant to put the boss kills in there as the special achievements all but guarantee you kill all bosses before you complete they probably put it in there to at least have something to fill the achieve for now. Beta is Beta and everything changes alot.</div></div><hr />

I agree with your first idea, but for the opposite reason (being that I like the Storm Drake more). ;)<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
&#8226; Loremaster of Eastern Kingdoms and Loremaster of Kalimdor no longer requires you to complete a given amount of quests anymore. You now have to complete the achievements for each zone to get the Loremaster title.<br />
<br />
I'm feeling rather mixed about the changes to the Loremaster achievement for Azeroth. It'll be easier for my alts to get Loremaster if I choose to do so, but it'll be easier to get Loremaster. &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

Loremaster, call me a nub, but I like the idea of going with zone by zone acheivement. So much easier to manage, especially with old world content for the simple reason there is so much that it's next to impossible to understand where you missed some quests, especially for old school toons.<br />
<br />
As far as druids and resto is concerned. Healers are going to go with what works. Blizzard wants us to use more heals in our arsenal, but the simple fact is, when we did, they nerfed it. Lifebloom is the prime example. And regardless of what Blizzard ends up doing, druids will adapt and use the most efficient spells in the arsenal and that will depend on mana regen and if too high, we'll just spam the best heal we have for the situation. I do agree that no new heal is needed, just a retooling of what we have so that whichever heal we use has a right situation.</div></div><hr />

Must love an achievement that rewards those that suck faster than those that actually accomplish things.<br />
<br />
Maybe they are.. I dunno.. going to make the game difficult again with mana meaning something and crowd control being brought back?<br />
<br />
And you really think the top end guilds don't wipe? Then why wasn't HM Lich king beat the day it was available?<br />
<br />
If you've never wiped in a raid you got carried, sorry</div></div><hr />

It's the truth, for how smug some people are when it comes to religious beliefs. It's disgusting.<br />

No, no they're not. Hopefully they're just placeholder, considering they're basically the same models as we've had for years, just re-textured. Lazy devs are lazy. Hire some new art teams already.<br />
<br />
Now i agree with half your post...not sure if the first part was sarcasm or not but hey never the less, imo fuck religion it will be the death of all man!! God dam dictators and all the rules written in a book telling you how you should live it can all burn for all i care.All that bullshit aside i agree with the second part.<br />
Ive always said i would wait longer and pay more for an extra dvd worth of fucking textures/new models whatever but the same old retextured shite, although i do understand a little, i guess it would be a bit insane to have all mobs or whatever looking different due to soem sort of lore behind them why they look like that or where they came from, it would be a little too much to take in i guess but hey although many agree that its not all about eye candy/athestics fair enough but it does work and it does sell, same reason sticking a pair of tits on an advert sells the product. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not going to claim my answer is 100% error-proof, but you won't lose the loremaster achievement/title when Cataclysm is released. If anything, Blizzard will make a separate reward/achievement.</div></div><hr />

As has been stated before, the &quot;We are Legendary&quot; achievement is not retroactive.</div></div><hr />
