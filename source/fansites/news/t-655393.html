After further consideration, and after hearing from many players, we are going to change how we approach the 2 vs. 2 arena bracket in Arena Season 7. We still think the 3 vs. 3 and 5 vs. 5 brackets will ultimately offer the best play experience, especially for very competitive gamers for whom game class balance issues are most noticeable. However, we recognize that many players just prefer to play in the 2 vs. 2 bracket and will miss the chance to earn the current season's gear. Therefore, we are going to still allow the 2 vs. 2 bracket to grant access to the current season of gear with three important exceptions: the current season's weapons will not be available for purchase, the current season’s shoulder armor will not be available for purchase, and players will not qualify for the Gladiator title/rewards unless you earn the appropriate rating in the 3 vs. 3 or 5 vs. 5 bracket. We look forward to the changes in the next major content patch and hope to have a great next Arena Season.</div></div><hr />

wow interesting, tell us more about that.<br />

well now they take the titles out of 2s which makes it even less interesting and more of a fun bracket than before. sucks tbh.<br />
my 3s rating is higher than 2s, but i consider 2s still a lot more fun and i would've liked to have the choice not to play 3s or 5s ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
2v2 is infinately easier than 3v3 or 5v5 and i dont agree 2v2 should have access to the best weapons.<br />
<br />
If you play an OP class in 2's it was just too easy to get access to the best gear in game. Alot of raiders would just roll in 2's and have the 232 weapon after 2 weeks of play, whereas those who dont pvp are still waiting for their drop in Ulduar.<br />
<br />
2v2 tho should still have access to last seasons weapons imo.<br />
<br />
But im glad that the facerollers will at last have to put a bit of effort in to get the newest gear instead of facerolling a few games each week :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Shoulders have just always been the hardest piece to get - they have the highest rating requirement. They do this because shoulders are the easiest part of armor to recognize (since you can turn off display helm), and thus let the higher ranked players stand out.</div></div><hr />

You will still be able to get 4 pieces from the latest season, and there are good pve weapons if you really can't play a 3s or 5s.<br />

<br />
<br />
QFT, this solution is just a complete fail. So many people play the game just to arena, most of them just for 2vs2, and they completely destroy it? Fuck, that's like taking raids away from PvE players?<br />
<br />
At the moment the only thing I do on my rogue is 2vs2, after the patch I might just start playing on my priest (soon 80)..</div></div><hr />

Those who just like playing 2s can still do that but they also have to play one of the other brackets to get all the gear.</div></div><hr />

Of course, gear is necessary and I hated the 1st thing they said about it, but I would prefer way more if we could get zero gear from 2v2 and still earn the title.<br />

2v2 is NOT balanced. I agree with you. But I prefer to try playing a bracket that although unbalanced, is my favorite, than playing a bracket I don't like as much just because it is &quot;balanced&quot;. <br />

Leave it as it is. If players want something more balanced, it's their choice to go 3v3 or 5v5.<br />

Good Job Blizzard, you've completely removed the competitiveness in 2v2, people will only do it (if they even do it for such) for gear, and you don't need to be 1st in your battlegroup for that end.</div></div><hr />

I never liked arena anyways because it's always the FOTM (and the last few seasons have been the class I play, go figure). I'm glad 2v2 is gone. Now nerf cleave and RMP and maybe arena will be, you know...good.</div></div><hr />

Treat everyone faily, Blizzard really. Stop implementing then penalising people for prefering a bracket or aspect of playing you can't balance whether it be via class mechanics or AP distrubution, honor etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see why they just can't have the earned point differential increase as the size of the arena increases, and allow all people with the appropriate ratings to purchase the gear.<br />

<br />
I know most of you are spoiled silly with blizz implementing a 2v2 bracket in the first place but think about it like this: name one other end-game aspect of wow that supports such a low group of players.<br />
<br />
Imho, WoW is about group play, and BGs are fucking awesome for PvP in that respect. If only skilled could be measured more accurately there. In the same way that END-GAME PvE content goes from 5--&gt;10--&gt;25 measurability I still htink PvP content should be revamped around the same principle. This will finally encourage large scale PvP guilds that have a serious presence 'as a guild' rather than as a few individuals within the guild. Think about it: Arena (5v5, perhaps 3v3 ???), Rated BGs (10v10 / 15v15 / 25v25 / 40v40) = PvP.<br />
<br />
I know some of you are whining that you are playing with your gf/bf/bro/roommate/whatever-else and don't want to break out of this small concrete group but i repeat, WoW as an MMOrpg only gets Diluted in quality and balance when catering to small groups. The same level of complexity CANNOT be achieved in 2v2 or 3v3 (see various forum threads about faceroll or fotm 3v3 combos).<br />
<br />
Now, for those that are too selfish to see beyond their own personal benefit (and that of one other person with them perhaps) can still be catered to by allowing 2v2 / 3v3 brackets but WITHOUT primary incentives, ergo 2v2 / 3v3 = one tier lower pvp gear, no titles (other than perhaps for participating or cosmetics, if you will) as regardless of how lazy you think Blizzard is, these small group pvp can NEVER be thoroughly balanced without diluting OUR gameplay. I can 100% bet the same people whining now about loosing 2v2 viability will/have whined whenever blizzard introduced various levels of class homogenization to balance pvp. Imagine for a second the levels of differentiation blizzard can permit when they KNOW skill is only being measured in 5v5+ situations.<br />
<br />
TL;DR Version: Blizzard screwed up by allowing for small group competition (2v2, 3v3) to thrive in an heterogeneous class environment (9-10 distinct classes). Blizzard should re-implement/define PvP so it promotes larger (ergo more balanced) groups and skill rather than allow for fotm flavored combos to dominate in this extremely important aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
* Mind you, i'm not saying skill can't be found within smaller brackets, just that it is impossible to significantly rule out class based dominance with low numbers of players, whilst still preserving class heterogeneity. And I doubt anyone here can argue that class based dominance doesn't kill the fun of any competitive environment that is supposed to measure skill and reward you based on that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But seriously - after reading some of the replies here... OMG read what you are saying guys.... realise that there is another world than the internet. Griefing and namecalling seems to be the only thing WOW players can do by now. And its pathetic to watch it.

&quot;Sorry 10man guilds dispite what we said in the beginning, you can't get weapon upgrades or shoulders in 10man instances anymore. You need a 25man guild to do that. You also can't get 10man protodrakes for all your time and effort,.&quot;<br />
<br />
Treat everyone faily, Blizzard really. Stop implementing then penalising people for prefering a bracket or aspect of playing you can't balance whether it be via class mechanics or AP distrubution, honor etc. <br />
More like &quot;Sorry 10 man guilds you can no longer get 25 man gear from doing 10 man raids.&quot; Oh wait it's already like that!<br />
<br />
And of course there's the people who say they'd rather have it so 2v2 doesn't get gear but can still get the glad title....yea of course you'd like it where your competition can't get any gear upgrades unless they have a 3v3 or 5v5 team while you poop on their faces :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
First it was: We can't solve the performance issues with WG so we make it that LESS people CAN participate in it.<br />
<br />
Now: We can't balance 2vs2, so let's just make it, that LESS people WANT to participate in it.<br />
<br />
It's like you're a surgeon and you're amputating the whole leg, just when the toenail is broken.<br />

Actually its more like the entire leg is a mess of broken bones and gangrene and the patient is just too stubborn to let it go.<br />

2v2 is an unbalanced mess constantly swayed by new FOTM teams, and there was really nothing else Blizz could do with WG besides get fewer people to play it.</div></div><hr />

It's not the bracket I have something against. It's more the fact WHY people play 2v2. It's not that it's more fun. It's because you can faceroll with an OP class all the way to 2400+. You can't do that in 3v3 and the people who QQ know that. That's why they QQ! <br />
<br />

For example if I was doing 3v3s last season and ran into Pally+DK+Warlock, I may as well just leave the goddamn game as soon as the gate opens. It just so happens its easier to faceroll a 2v2 combo to 2200+, which explains the crackdown on the bracket (also because there's just simply more 2v2 teams playing). This change probably won't affect the fact that &quot;bring the player not the class&quot; has been an idea thrown completely down the shitter, but it may help bring some life to a very dead 5v5 bracket.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I have no idea why people are saying Blizzard caved to casuals. It clearly states at the end of the blue post that 2v2 players won't be getting access to anything worth a damn.

I dont care about PVP, in my opnion when a arena sesson start they should allow players to transfer their character to a diferent server, making a big championship (something like a character copy for PRT). There all classes can be tunned equaly for the arena matches, so PVE would be tunned exclusively for PVE encounters and not by arena PVP.<br />

<br />
granted that most of the top players share the top spot on all brackets, but if you remove the 100 teams in 2s, you would need a TON more people to play more 3s to make up the difference in Glads. either that or just have half the Glads than previous season (an even smaller number comparing S4 -&gt; S5).</div></div><hr />

It's bad if you think realistic of course because pve is a whole different thing, but think how some raiders would feel if Blizz would suddenly say that they can still run the instances but they wont be awarded with any loot or titles? They wont of course do that but that's just how I feel right now, I can still do 2vs2 for fun and I will, but it just doesnt feel rewarding anymore..</div></div><hr />

<br />
2v2 is infinately easier than 3v3 or 5v5 and i dont agree 2v2 should have access to the best weapons.<br />
<br />
If you play an OP class in 2's it was just too easy to get access to the best gear in game. Alot of raiders would just roll in 2's and have the 232 weapon after 2 weeks of play, whereas those who dont pvp are still waiting for their drop in Ulduar.<br />
<br />
2v2 tho should still have access to last seasons weapons imo.<br />
<br />
But im glad that the facerollers will at last have to put a bit of effort in to get the newest gear instead of facerolling a few games each week :)<br />
<br />
<br />
In some cases, those OP 2's classes fell off in 3's and plummeted in 5's. If Blizz is going to do this, they need to re-examine pvp balancing and ensure that classes have competitive specs in 3's and 5's. If we're going to punish 2's, a higher rating requirement should be enough. That or they're going to have to fix some classes for better competition in 3's and 5's.</div></div><hr />

Add a 4v4 bracket and rated BGs while you're at it. You cannot balance healing and burst with the raid progression and the existance of 2v2, 3v3, and 5v5 around.<br />

<br />
Balance your fucking game, Blizzard.<br />
<br />
<br />
You know that the reason they nerfed 2v2 rewards is that they had to balance the 'RMP' and 'Cleave' bracket (3v3) by introducing higher resilience value =&gt; less instagibbing in few CDs =&gt; less RMP and Cleave dominance in 3v3. Now 2dps teams will not be viable anymore in 2v2 and pretty much all games will come down to mana.<br />
<br />
Now that 3v3 will be less instagibbing, it will actually be fun again. Also you people underestimate the influx of noobs that will happen in 3v3, if they nerf the 2v2 rewards. More noobs in 3v3 =&gt; easier kills =&gt; easier rating =&gt; more fun.<br />
<br />
The only thing is that people will have to find one more arena partner, the other concers are being adressed (or are finally able to be) with exactly this patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, gear is necessary and I hated the 1st thing they said about it, but I would prefer way more if we could get zero gear from 2v2 and still earn the title.<br />
<br />
2v2 is NOT balanced. I agree with you. But I prefer to try playing a bracket that although unbalanced, is my favorite, than playing a bracket I don't like as much just because it is &quot;balanced&quot;. <br />
<br />
Leave it as it is. If players want something more balanced, it's their choice to go 3v3 or 5v5.<br />
<br />
I rarely complain, I think it's actually the 1st time I'm saying this, but here it goes:<br />
<br />
Good Job Blizzard, you've completely removed the competitiveness in 2v2, people will only do it (if they even do it for such) for gear, and you don't need to be 1st in your battlegroup for that end.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am willing to bet a vast majority of 2s are just casual and don't really care. I mean me and my wife do 2s for ghetto pvp gear to play around in so you get easy rating off us. You don't deserve a Glad title and hell I wouldn't even give the 3s it either. 5s are most deserving for the true commitment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the perspective of someone who doesn't do arenas all that often, this makes arenas appear more appealing to me. I actually WANT to get into a competitive team now because of these changes. I would play 2s with some friends, and MAYBE a few 3s games which I always found very exciting. I never really enjoyed 2s much because it seemed there was not that much strategy to it. I typically had about one (1) Global Cooldown to react to being burst down or I would die, and that GCD would typically happen while I was stunned or otherwise had my keyboard removed from my desk, metaphorically speaking of course. <br />
<br />
With 3s it seemed there was more strategy, more need to choose targets carefully, and more need to be organized and not Lolburst. Because of this the matches usually lasted a good deal longer and they were more enjoyable, at least for me.<br />
<br />
I welcome these changes, personally. I don't really think it's that big a problem for a lot of the hardcore Arena people because they usually have high rankings in multiple brackets anyways.</div></div><hr />

Classes like Rets for example will whine because they own in 2's and have a harder time in 3's. Mages are the opposite, terrible in 2's and they own in 3's. These responses are pretty predicable. The truth is 3's has better balance and Blizz wants that to be the focus for obvious reasons.</div></div><hr />

Everything is in proportion, those at the top had to step on the ones below to get there, so that means that more baddies played 2's as well. I've been playing off and on since S1, and i found it was easier to find one good player besides myself that i could tolerate, as well as working on timing issues. Because of the incoming nerfs to 2's i bet we see a decline of players participating in arena.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It felt like I had just been playing a zergfest and waiting for the other team to pop defensive CDs just to do a switch to get another CD to be used.<br />
<br />
Eventually switching to a target where the team had nothing left and winning.<br />
<br />
2s felt like a real challenge with a gimp comp that I played against comps where we would have to play perfect and we would still lose.<br />
<br />
I don't care regardless and will still probably play 2s, but find it less of a challenge just another one of the many nails in the coffin come 3.2.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to all the ret/holy palidans and the Dk's who can't coast through 2s now to get their gear/ratings but the change was needed. At least in three's and five's you have some versatility class wise to produce a winning comp. In two's its basically roll a DK/Pali or Druid to win. I don't really feel like listening to all the people who pvp occasionally because you have no idea what you're talking about. As for three's their are counter comps to RMP if you are actually decent at playing your class. <br />
<br />
At least with 3's and 5's it takes a little bit more skill/coordination and a little less spam 1 1 1 1 2 Kill. Learn how to actually pvp and stop complaining.</div></div><hr />

I play around 1900-2000 with my 3s and played at 1850 with my 2s. You're sick of rogue/priest or dk/paladin teams in 2s? Fine! Go play 3s and get roflstomped by cleave combos all night long. Or maybe try out some 5s? Zergfest inc?<br />
<br />
Many people here - including myself - aren't entitled to complain about balance, because we lose games because we could have played better. The few active 2200+ teams - sure. They can seriously discuss stuff. All the rest won't ever reach Duelist or Gladiator ranks. So why care who gets them anyway?<br />
<br />
2s is a fun setup. Sure, balance sucks, but WoW will never change that. Balance sucks in 3s and 5s as well, so what. Organizing a 5s is like organizing a little raid group, it will never be as popular.</div></div><hr />

It's not just a simple OH shit switch, it takes all 3/4 of you're dps to have their cc's if necessary set and all 3/4 of you're dps to engage at the same time. As much as you make it seem like there is no skill involved, it requires being able to play under the pressure of 4 different enemies producing the same amount of damage to you. Some people aren't good enough to play at that level therefore don't play 5s and aren't as good as they think they really are.</div></div><hr />

Or just because there arent many players playing 5vs5?<br />

Seriosly, 2vs2 high ratings are just as hard as 3vs3 and 5vs5 high ratings.. no-one can just &quot;faceroll&quot; there, stop pretending that 2vs2 is for some fotm player who faceroll to the top while 3vs3 and 5vs5 are 100% about skill and cordination ._.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it's better than, destroy target x in under 1 minute or 2, how? Because that's what 3v3 and 5v5 in my experience from S5-6. <br />
<br />
I actually enjoyed both 3v3 and 5v5 in TBC, in fact I barely played 2v2, as I found 3v3 more interesting to play. But in WotLK, there is no skill in 3v3, no skill in 5v5 (S5/6), because the strategy is all the same, take 2 melee and a healer, make those 2 melee sit on one target until it dies. Whoever wins is determined by who kills the first person first. Wow, I just played 40 of these games today alone. At least in 2v2 you get time to think, make decisions. Or of course you get RPM, which are just plaining boring to play against.<br />
<br />
This 2v2 change is pointless, it doesn't really address anything. If 3v3 was at least at TBC level I wouldn't care about 2v2, but as it stands 2v2 is only thing that I enjoy in arena. I'm sadly not blessed with choosing which class I play arena with. So in S7 my only choice is either disc and resto druid and warrior or warrior hunter disc. Neither sound like comps that will get anywhere.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A good change, obviously the right one to make. I can't understand why 2v2 even exists, it should just be cut from the game entirely. <br />
<br />
WoW is a group based game, so pvp should work with 5v5, 10v10, 20v20 and 40v40 rated battles (e.g. guild battles). 2v2 and 3v3 just cannot be balanced because this game is not a game for small numbers of players. Otherwise you'd get 2man dungeons or 2 man raids? Savvy?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instead of making one thing more appealing, they make the other one less appealing. :I<br />
<br />
The main reason why 2's are more popular than 3's and 5's is that you need just 2 players for it. Also, 2's have less of a BG feeling. There's a lot more of personal finesse that you can bring in. <br />
<br />
The Gladiator change is plain stupid. Don't know why Blizzard removes a title from a part of their arena concept, where nearly everything else is rewarded with a prefix to your name.<br />

In fact, the reality will be: Bring the comp, not the player.</div></div><hr />

4 of those '4% teams' are CLEAVE. i.e. 16% and thats only the most popular. It wouldnt surprise me if cleave turned out to be close to 27% also. At least for my battlegroup i rarely meet any other team than cleave or a BM hunter x x team.<br />
<br />
Theres also for sure going to be some caster combos hidden and a lot more shamans after shaman buffs. One of the top 10 teams on our BG is ele sham/boomkin/disc priest who just pwn cleave and its hard to CC a boomkin for RMP - making it a good combo. Both classes are capable of INSANE nuke also and compliment each other:) Hybrids would rather just FOTM resto than try boomkin which actually does work in 3v3 with the right setup / practise.</div></div><hr />

Well that was out of topic but im not much of a raider im more of a pvper/arena. I see this upcoming change and it excites me to come back to the game and re-lvl from lvl 1 to 80. I had 3 lvl 80s but i gave them all to my nephew wich he hated me because i had all horde characters lol, but since the new patch it seems like he will be able to switch to alliance. Well im coming back to WoW and raiding doesnt facinate me so im coming back to arena and hit that 2100+ rating i always wanted to. But since burning crusade there seems to be a few changes in the classes( like blizz always does, nerf this, buff that) lol. Well anyways i thought id get some advice from the people on wich class to try to re-lvl and do arena again with. I dont want to have like the best buffed class but i dont want to have the nerfed class i just want a class that is fun to play in arena and good at it. Oh and by the way i had a lvl 70 shaman i was resto i only raided with my shammy, i had a lvl 70 hunter and a lvl 70 pally. I remeber my hunter being the best at arena at that time so i used him the most. But since those characters arent mine anymore i dont want to upset my nephew so ill just start from scratch with a lvl 1.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any advice on wich class to roll on please respond i havent been online for ages now lol. And 1 more thing i wont roll alliance so alliance players dont say roll a human priest just give me advice on wich class to roll on not the faction, im loyal to horde =).</div></div><hr />

PVP is broken in ALL brackets, not just 2v2. High ranking will be as easy as RMP as it was as Priest rogue and we still will have an unfair advantage because of the classes we play (not bragging, I think its wrong).<br />

We still think the 3 vs. 3 and 5 vs. 5 brackets will ultimately offer the best play experience, especially for very competitive gamers for whom game class balance issues are most noticeable. However, we recognize that many players just prefer to play in the 2 vs. 2 bracket and will miss the chance to earn the current season's gear. Therefore, we are going to still allow the 2 vs. 2 bracket to grant access to the current season of gear with three important exceptions: the current season's weapons will not be available for purchase, the current season’s shoulder armor will not be available for purchase, and players will not qualify for the Gladiator title/rewards unless you earn the appropriate rating in the 3 vs. 3 or 5 vs. 5 bracket. We look forward to the changes in the next major content patch and hope to have a great next Arena Season.<br />

Hi we don't give a crap about 2v2 bracket we just made it so the uber fotm classes can get easy wins.

3.2: Wintergrasp gets nerfed AGAIN in that only 100 people may enter a battle at any given time per faction, making the zone only capable of supporting 200 people per battle, with the excuse of &quot;still to much lag, this'll fix it&quot;, when in reality people were still doing Wintergrasp to much and Blizzard didn't like that.<br />

It's easier for them to put 3v3,5v5 rating requirements than to actually do something to make the game fun for everyone.<br />

Sadly one healer should have no problem staying alive vs two dps easily, unless he runs oom. If one dps can kill a healer, no fun game is possible.<br />

the stronger the healers become, the more fun u will have. I think because of the long games they provided major dps in wotlk, but forgot that if u destroy the healing class, there is no skill involved.<br />

If people cant be gibbed, people will need to use their brains and thus the best will win.<br />

I must say at the end of tbc when we got our new talents, the dps was perfect. The game were alot faster paced and damage was pretty crazy. But compared to wotlk, damage was tuned nice :)<br />

<br />
<br />
I would argue that you are too stupid too understand why it can never be balanced without total homogonisation.<br />
2 classes of certain type will always be inheritantly stronger than 2 other classes of certain type.<br />
<br />
This is something you can not change.<br />
<br />
Druid / Warrior too strong atm?<br />
Fine nerf them.<br />
Oh look, the next best setup is now strongest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another thing that you may not realise is that in different battlegroups there are different setups which dominate.<br />
<br />
How the fuck do you balance that, hmm?<br />
Rogue / Mage wins in one group, whereas DK / Druid dominates another.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see you balance that.<br />
<br />
Unless you make the game counterstrike style where everyone has the same abilities and you take all rng out the game, it can never be balanced. And to be fair, i think they do quite a decent job of making everyone viable.<br />
<br />
There isn't a single class in the game that is not able to get over 2.3k rating in 2v2.<br />
<br />
Have a think next time you start to rant, because it boils down to one thing. If you think its unfair, then you simply arent playing your class in a way that allows you to win.<br />
<br />
There is no arguing with that, because as stated, there is at least one of every single class is currently 2.3k rated or over, which means it is possible, no matter what you play with.</div></div><hr />

I just joined a 2v2 team because a good friend asked me to. I haven't even played any matches yet. He asked me before all these changes were announced. One of the biggest problems I have is finding enough people online to actually run with at night. I can't play during the normal &quot;prime&quot; time that a lot of people can because I have a child. So I only play after she's asleep for the night.<br />
<br />
I was really looking forward to playing, but finding out that I'm not even going to be eligible for title rewards or weapons is disappointing. I don't PVP a lot, I'm not a &quot;faceroll&quot; class (I don't think, I'm an arms warrior, I've never touched arena with a 10-foot-pole and only recently began dipping my toes into battlegrounds at all). So I'm not trying to QQ about it from the aspect that I've been doing 2v2 all along and I just want another easy season. What incentive is there for me to play if I can't get good rewards out of it in the end? Because of my time limitations, I don't usually have the opportunity to do raids either. I liked the idea of at least being able to earn a cool weapon from doing arena.<br />
<br />
So now I'm trying to talk my guild leader into maybe setting us up with a 5v5 team from the guild members who are on at the same time of night we are. He's QQing about how much it costs to actually make a 5v5 team. Whee.<br />
<br />
I can definitely see how balance would be an issue with a 2v2 setup, simply because of the way some class combos work, but I just don't know if Blizzard is really taking the right angle to fixing this problem. I honestly almost wish that, if balance is that bad of an issue, really just get rid of 2v2 and 3v3 and do 5v5.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Domeno</div><div class="date">2009-07-04, 03:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in the same boat. Due to work and family time, I do not have time to raid long hours. My only chance at any decent gear (especially a weapon) is arena. One big problem with arena is it is hard to find a partner for 2v2 that is reliable enough to achieve 1850+ rating and farm enough points to buy a decent weapon. I totally have given up on a 3s or 5s team. Its hard to find 1 person for a 2s but it's a LOT harder to fill a 3s or 5s team with reliable people; especially when you take into consideration my play schedule. Seems like the game is leaning more and more towards serious players and casual players will never have a chance at even considering decent gear. I left Everquest for WoW thinking it would be more fun to play since i could have a life and play too, but that is starting to not appear that way at all. In Everquest you had to play everyday for long long hours to achieve anything. That is why EQ is dying off rapidly. If they get rid of 2s then I'll be stuck with a Titansteel Destroyer forever. Really disappointing... They should at least make the furious weapons available or some kind of weapons available as a &quot;stepping stone&quot; to help get you to the newer gear... I mean hell, how do you go from a 170ish dps weapon to a 261dps weapon? There are none in between unless you are a hardcore raider... Which I will never have the time to do unfortunately... Kind of a crazy setup... Surely there is a better way.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
10 vs 10 and every class must be represented exactly once. What specc each class choses it the determining factor...and players skill.<br />
<br />
I am sure people will easily find faults with this too, ofc...<br />
<br />
<br />
faults, oh yes, if every class can be represented once, then people will eventually find one spec in many or even every class that is the superior one, and the people who play the 2 other specs are either forced to respec against their will for arenagear, and we'll have 2/3s of the playerbase pissed off :p<br />
<br />
To the actaul problem though, i guess they did this because they realised they'll never manage to balance 2v2 properly, but this is gonna suck for the &quot;casuals&quot; in wow, and this is a pretty new perspective from then blizz crew :P since launc the game has become more casual-friendly every day, this is 1 step back.<br />

<br />
THis change is quite logical, to get pve counterparts of this gear you need to do 25man hardmodes and now you could just get op comp and farm rating, get at least 232 lvl gear very easy, 239 weaps were a bit harder, now it will be even harder as it should be to get best items and its going into right way.<br />
<br />
The change is logical, why 2 people playing together should get items of lvl that normally in pve requires menaging big guild of people exceptional geared and knowlegable of their class &amp; boss mechanics and 25 people need to being able to do everything perfect.<br />
<br />
Now at least pvp`ers need to put a little more focus and teamplay into getting their imba gear and not just get a good comp and faceroll to 2k rating, then maybe they actually needed to put a bit of skill to get higher ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
to a guy whinning he is stuck with titansteel destroyer and cant get upgrade cause of arena change:<br />
there are months of time to next patch, you can still get in this arena season and with warrior shouldnt be hard to get at least 232 weap even if you suck at pvp, you can go naxx25 to get 213 &amp; 226 lvl weapon, or go ulduar10 for 219ilvl one[or even lvl232 if you menage to kill xt hardmode, which isnt really hard anyway], and you can get 232 pve weap from first bosses in ulduar 25 so really stop whinning, put some effor and you will have it.</div></div><hr />

Stop comparing arena PvP to Raids. If you gonna follow that road then by that logic battlegrounds should reward you the best rewards. At the end of the day arena battles are very small scale fights. Difference between 2v2 and 3v3 is very small (only 1 extra person), difference between 10 man and 25 man is much bigger (double and then some).<br />
<br />
I do see where you lot coming from but it's not very good comparison.<br />

You dont get the idea.<br />
Getting 5 people that ar capable to PVP.<br />
For example My guild 60ppl:<br />
About 3-5 of them are able to get over 2000 raiting nowdays. I can even scracth viable comp with them.<br />
pvp is harden than pve. Some servers have shitty popularity, getting extra dude with brains is pain in ...( prob. mentioned before)<br />

All the people who say 2v2 is easy mode obviously never did serious 2v2, either. I reached 2.1k rating in Season 4 with my priest and some rogue I found, but I had ended up changing my partner 4 times during the season to eventually settle with a warlock. We both started in S2 gear that I had bought soon as I dinged (the day before S4 started) and most games we ended up fighting fully S4 geared gladiator teams. Then I picked up another priest I knew, and we reached 2.2k in 3v3. However, I despise 3v3 and 5v5. It is hard enough, as someone mentioned, to even hope to find someone competent enough, especially with the start of S5. I quit arena purely by the fact that I could not even find anyone who could even hope to be a decent partner, and everyone we did fight would have lots of the gear from VoA already (from which I have unfortunately never been lucky enough to get a piece). If you're fighting nothing but &quot;scrub&quot; teams in 2v2, then you're obviously a scrub yourself. 2v2 is not broken or unbalanced. The people who play 2v2 are broken. Yes, it's obvious some teams are more powerful than others, but it's only that way because putting a highly skilled player with the &quot;FOTM&quot; class obviously equals dangerous results, but any half decent player would somehow be able to overcome the obstacle with a just as decent partner.</div></div><hr />

I'm not that naive, PvP in WoW never been balanced, it never will be but S3/5 were closer to balance on balance bar than it is today.<br />

Problem is not getting those people into raids they agreed to that. Problem is getting those same people that you know from raiding and are good at pvp to play with you for few hours (I mean c'mon who the hell does just 10 games a week). All of them may able to get together for raid times but when it comes to any extra curriculum activities it may become hard to make people be there at certain time. From my experience people don't want to have another &quot;commitment&quot; other than they already have from raiding.<br />
<br />
I'm going to say this again, my problem is that that they removing 2v2 from PvP scene but that there's little evidence that they actually will try to balance 3v3 bracket before S9. So as it stands now they taking something fun away without giving anything back.</div></div><hr />

About 3-5 of them are able to get over 2000 raiting nowdays. I can even scracth viable comp with them.<br />
pvp is harden than pve. Some servers have shitty popularity, getting extra dude with brains is pain in ...( prob. mentioned before)<br />
Im myself playing 2v2 with drood now, even 2v2 he is completely not capable doing more than 2.1k rait. ;D<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, someone who admits how mindlessly easy PVE is! And they say PVP is skillless...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
IMHO who plays WoW only for PvP made a big mistake.<br />
<br />
It's skill-less to compete when u have at least 20 ability to cast and when we have so many difference in class balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh wait, yea morons still do say this.</div></div><hr />

2v2 is for Noobs. The REAL skill is in 3's. But it's sad to see RPM's get pwned by Melee Cleave teams... Paladin Death Knight Druid seems to pwn all. Druid healing is OP, Paladins are OP, and DK's are OP.<br />
<br />
Mage Priest Rogue's will pwn again someday, they only 3 classes that actually require skill</div></div><hr />

Please remind me when RMP stopped &quot;pwning&quot; in 3s.... Pretty sure it was one of the best comps since s1 till now.</div></div><hr />

The only thing skillful about a rogue is when to blind, and that is like, not hard.<br />
<br />
Other than that its stun, stun, mash dps buttons.<br />

Rogue a skillful class?<br />

people will be forced to be doing 3s or 5s which is all in all more for everybody, since you don't NEED to be playing RMP, there's a lot of combos being viable to play in 3s.. <br />
<br />
how the hell would you balance 2v2 when you'd have to balance; dk/druid/ret.. those classes are dominating the 2s bracket and if you're one of the above classes playing one of the FoTM combs.. try to see it from another pov imo, instead of seeing it as a total devastating hit to you as a player, because if you have somewhat a decent rating in the 2s bracket you will also be able to achieve the same if not higher rating in 3s.. if not.. well that's just another keyboard turning, back peddling clicking, fotm retard :-)</div></div><hr />

We re playing ok in 2vs2 atm but next season if we cant buy the arena gear from arena team rating 2vs2 anymore thats not fair ! Blizzard thinking it s impossible to balance 2vs2 atm but imo even 3vs3 still there is combo that s better than others ( like RPM eh look at MLG arena tournement) . Maybe inscree the rating require to buy the gear from 2vs2 to 1900 for T1 S7 weapon and 2450 for T2 season 7 weapon same for Shoulder make it buyable at 2200 rating 2vs2 .</div></div><hr />

I have a resto druid (yay op) who face rolled to 2.2k with 2 piece resto hateful, 3 piece savage boomkin, and the rest pve boomkin pieces. I played Dk / Warrior / Druid.

After i got gear, i did 2's and am still progressing in it.<br />

I really don't see how people can say 2's is any worse than 3's... Any Cleave team / RMP can faceroll even HIGHER than in 2's. <br />

No you don't get it cleave is a skill setup. They have to skillfully pick who they are going to zerg down.<br />

<br />
Imo 3s is actually easier than 2s, it takes less tactic and its the main reason why people don't enjoy it (asside the fact that if you don't have a decent rating you cant get a decent 3s partner/partner thats available to arena at you're time)<br />
<br />
In 2s it gets situational, sure there are Faceroll teams, but same shit applies for 3s. Only reason why its hard to balance 2s is because WoW is based on raids or BGs rather than 1v1 to 3v3 situations. Its why FPS games like TF2,CS, Gears of War,Halo 3 are good, because it has alot of tactics involved. <br />
<br />
Plus if you hate grinding and don't know why? the reason why you hate grinding is because its the same rotation over and over. Charge-Mortal Strike - Whirlwind - Execute or Cheapshot - Mutilate - Evis - Mutilate - Mutilate - Evis. Same thing everytime. Unlike PvP its more on situation than the same routine. In 3v3, its situational, but there isn't much tactics involved asside hiding behind a pillar, Unlike 2s, a great example such as rogue/mage would have lots of situations such as resetting, Kiting, Surviving, Bursting, CC timing and unable to cause many errors. In 3s its like rogue/priest, Burst switch - Burst Switch (Obviously CC please don't list the obvious) until one of them dies. Cleave teams are like Druid/DK, Just stick onto a target and train them down, not much effort is put into 3s, which is why it isn't popular enough, but instead blizzard doesn't understand this picture as they just want the comp as a sport rather than an MMORPG. So why don't we make Aion a sport? honestly, its ridiculously. <br />
<br />
My opinion about the change: Its OK at least people can get the chance to get 4/5 of the seasons gear, although hopefully t1 weapons would be included too. Otherwise it wouldn't be fair. Especially with the resilience buff reducing damage by X Percent. Weapons are very important in s7 for any melee and caster.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Sorry 10man guilds dispite what we said in the beginning, you can't get weapon upgrades or shoulders in 10man instances anymore. You need a 25man guild to do that. You also can't get 10man protodrakes for all your time and effort,.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No it isn't, because balancing 10 man raids does not conflict with balancing 25 man raids at all. <br />
<br />
They aren't stopping 2v2 purely because they can't balance it. They are stopping 2v2 because they can't simultaneously balance it with the other brackets. There is no reasonable way to do so. In one bracket you'll have a single DPS trying to bring someone down while a single healer is trying to keep them up. How can you balance that without breaking the other brackets in which the 1 healer has to keep someone up through 2 dps?<br />
<br />
Something had to give, and imo 2v2 was the right choice.</div></div><hr />

Well, we all witnessed the massive changes when wotlk was out. Why are you saying Blizz can't bring the classes to a competent level? So far warr, dk got their buffs and nerf and are more normal now than early wotlk. Still they leave a class with 5'' spell immunity, 1' of 90% evasion active in arenas. <br />
My personal opinion for 2v2 combos is that 2x dps are way more fun than dps+mother Teresa. I myself play huntard+retri. Up to 1750 but at least it's fun to play with.</div></div><hr />

My favourite bracket is 2v2, and the changes im seeing makes, me wanna quit this game. 2v2 bracket is most entertaining to play, and for some reason the hardest. Why ? cus when you face counter combos you need to do everything possible to overcome it. I play for a warrior with, a prot pala in 2v2, and when i see a DK/pala, i know i have no chance in beating them, but i accept it how it is.<br />
3v3 is too unbalanced ! Tbh im not an excellent player, and it took me about 2 moths to get to 2200 in 2v2, while i scored 2250 in 3v3 in 2 days, playing ret/war/druid... is that the best play experience its offering ?<br />
5v5 are interesting to play tho, but its really hard to make a team like one. having all 5 people online at the same time is sort of a miracle...<br />
Tbh i dont understand why blizzards are nerfing 2v2. Why cant i take shoulders or weapon, does it offend someone ? and the title, its just a title like any other else. Its hard to get it anyway, but now its impossible in 2v2, whats the reason about that ?<br />
Nerfing 2v2 will only result im more good pvpers quitng the game. it wount be better for nobody.</div></div><hr />
