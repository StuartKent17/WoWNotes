Blizzard released a preview of the legendary staff: Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest. The model we datamined a few weeks ago was apparently a very early version of the staff and it was revamped considerably since the first time we saw the model. You can still recognize a few features of the original staff such as the Eye (Stage 2, 3, and 4). <br />
Ever since the death of the Dragon Aspect Malygos, the blue dragonflight has struggled with appointing a new leader. Its members are now torn between the two likeliest successors: Kalecgos, who champions reconciliation with other races; and Arygos, a scion of Malygos who believes that his kind should withdraw from the world and forge a new path. To end the constant debates and arguments, the flight has agreed to gather during the Embrace—an extraordinary celestial event in which Azeroth's two moons come into perfect alignment—in the hopes that a new Aspect will be selected.<br />
<br />
Yet a recent discovery by the bronze dragon Anachronos bodes ill for this impending ceremony. The timeless dragon has detected sinister magic at work around the Nexus, the blue flight's frozen lair in Northrend. Along with this find, he has glimpsed a terrifying vision of Azeroth succumbing to flames. The link between this chilling portent and the blue dragons remains unclear, but Anachronos has called upon what some of his kind deem the &quot;short-lived&quot; races to investigate further. If a hero does not rise to the challenge and find the truth, Anachronos's dire vision of Azeroth's undoing could become reality.<br />
<br />

<br />
Patch 4.2 introduces an epic quest that will challenge those daring enough to complete the legendary staff Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest. The great staff duplicates destructive magics, and also bestows upon its wielder the ability to transform into a member of the Blue Dragonflight. Those who complete the staff won’t be the only ones to receive a reward, though. As this task requires the dedication of an entire guild, upon completion of the staff all guild members will receive a unique non-combat pet to call their own.<br />
<br />

<br />
Behold the legendary staff Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest. Players will need to embark on an epic questline to obtain and upgrade this powerful weapon.<br />
<br />
Only those who have emerged triumphant against the evils lurking within Blackwing Descent, The Bastion of Twilight, and the Throne of the Four Winds will be eligible to begin the legendary quest. Bronze Dragonflight emissaries will be sent to the Alliance and Horde capital cities of Stormwind and Orgrimmar to recruit those who are ready to undertake the challenge.<br />

<br />
This is not a path to be undertaken lightly. Be warned: the way forward is deadly, the first steps are perilous, and the destination, as yet, unfathomable. The journey will take willing challengers across continents and through time; to meet with ancient beings, to be recognized as one of the most powerful entities on Azeroth; to navigate a lethal web of politics and determine the shape of the future.<br />
<br />
While the journey will certainly require progress through the Firelands, where guilds will need to work together to topple the forces of Ragnaros, there are times where those seeking the staff will have to stand alone in order to prove their skill, knowledge, and determination.<br />
<br />
The Bronze Dragonflight is counting on you. The Blue Dragonflight may lose its way without your guidance. Best not keep them waiting.</div></div><hr />

On top of that the whole quest line leading up to getting the legendary sounds well legendary lol. The fact that your whole guild needs to participate to get the staff is awesome and really dictates guild cohesiveness which is a great idea in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Because of Anachronos and considering &quot;This is not a path to be undertaken lightly. Be warned: the way forward is deadly, the first steps are perilous, and the destination, as yet, unfathomable. The journey will take willing challengers across continents and through time; to meet with ancient beings, to be recognized as one of the most powerful entities on Azeroth; to navigate a lethal web of politics and determine the shape of the future.&quot; I predict Cavern's of Time involvement?<br />

Oh yeah. Blasphemy that Blizzard have the Blue Dragonflight situated where they are in lore... I mean, we need new stuff! New! The Alliance can't live in Stormwind! They need to have a fortress flying over the Maelstrom! The Horde in Orgrimmar? Never! They should obviously be in a new zone, like righht next to the Bastion of Twilight.<br />

Oh wait. None of that makes sense. Blizz is making us go back there, because that's where the lore says we would go.</div></div><hr />

B/c they feel they've been given the shaft for the last 5 years in terms of legendaries (Thori'dal doesn't count apparently) and so no matter how many times Blizzard says no they're hoping that Blizzard changes their minds. Just gotta keep showing them up-to-date posts where Blizzard continues to say no and then when 4.2 rolls around they can finally accept it.</div></div><hr />

B/c then tanks would demand a stam version, melee dps would demand a strength version, and healers would demand a spirit version. That and the &quot;offensive spells&quot; proc on the staff would have to be rewritten for each class type. Just doesn't make it legendary anymore.<br />

<br />
Yeah, it's a difficult balance though. Either 25 man guilds break into 2 10-man groups for the chain, or 10-man guilds disband and join 25 man guilds b/c it takes a much shorter amount of time to get a staff in 25 man guilds. With the professions making it easier in 25 man guilds, i'm sure it's going to be something like &quot;requires 50 truegold bars&quot;</div></div><hr />

With that wording yes. Working as a team to make your guild better? No. To &quot;Show people we are better than them&quot; yes. That kind of attitude is typically what turned this game into a Casual Vs Hardcore game instead of a game of fun.</div></div><hr />

I'm virtually certain it would be normal modes only. The requirement is probably that you have the &quot;Defender of the Shattered World&quot; title. <br />

Because of Anachronos and considering &quot;This is not a path to be undertaken lightly. Be warned: the way forward is deadly, the first steps are perilous, and the destination, as yet, unfathomable. The journey will take willing challengers across continents and through time; to meet with ancient beings, to be recognized as one of the most powerful entities on Azeroth; to navigate a lethal web of politics and determine the shape of the future.&quot; I predict Cavern's of Time involvement?<br />
<br />
Side note: Totally a hunter weapon.<br />
<br />
Further... What will the ancient beings be? A titan perhaps? Perhaps traveling to a time when Norgannon was on Azeroth to receive an artifact to imbue Kalecgos with the power to be the aspect of magic? Either way it's going to be an interesting quest line to follow.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is making Heroic Raid loot (the base loot on all bosses) the reward for Heroic Raiding. Not the Legendary. It's going to be insanely hard to finish, aside from the top 0.5% of raid guilds, in the first 2 months even. Heroic Raiding will likely speed it up some (as it did for Shadowmourne), but it will not be necessary to finish it (just like it wasn't for Val'anyr with Hard Modes, or Shadowmourne with Heroic Mode).<br />
<br />
It's a caster weapon, offensive. As for the classes, I would assume Mage, Warlock, Priest, Druid, and Shaman, all have an offensive caster spec (or 3 in the case of Mage and Warlock) and can use staff weapons.<br />
<br />
Don't complain about your class/spec/role not getting a Legendary. Last one offensive casters saw was Aitesh, and it was about 4 years ago. Only tanks can make the same ages-old claim (and I don't consider that DKs could tank with Shadowmourne to validate it for all 4), and I suppose Enhancement shamans too, but that is a little more difficult to identify a solution for (given they basically share melee weapons with Combat Rogues only now, since the other specs use all Daggers for Rogues, Hunters would just let the melee weapon rot as a stat-stick they can't enchant in Cata with anything of note, and Ferals use 2H not 1H for DPS).</div></div><hr />

Yeah but now you can't have someone in your guild who &quot;gets bored&quot; of their current toon right before 4.2 hits and levels up a caster to be their new &quot;main&quot;.<br />
<br />
Had a problem with that last yeah when Shadowmorne came out and suddenly one of the officers was bored of his caster so he made a dk his new main character.<br />
<br />
Edit: Not saying that there aren't players who get bored of playing one class and switch, but I've seen way too many suspicious changes of main toons when a new legendary comes out to believe it to be just coincidence.</div></div><hr />

No offense taken, and I'm glad that you like the item as-is. :) The reason I brought up my complaint about the name is that names are especially important to me as a player. The names I choose for my characters are the most important defining characteristic for their personalities and histories. I apply that same outlook to items as well (for good or ill). I guess that as more information about the item is made available, the reason for the name Dragonwrath may become clear. I hope. As a side note: Hazelnutcoffee, Nethaera's Ambrosia would be pretty cool actually. I'd giggle every time I see it, and something that makes me smile is always welcome. (I miss seeing Neth post a lot on the official forums.)</div></div><hr />

Just gotta keep showing them up-to-date posts where Blizzard continues to say no and then when 4.2 rolls around they can finally accept it.<br />
<br />
To be fair, Thori'dal really doesn't count. Before more than a handful of hunters even had the thing, they changed steady shot in such a way that the Golden Bow of Quel'thelas was actually the superior weapon in most scenarios. That's right, the epic weapon from the same tier was superior to the legendary gained from the final boss of the expansion. Hunters DID get the shaft because people like you can claim that hunters got their weapon, but of course our weapon was awful. Hell, with ammo gone now, even the novelty is gone. Then to add further insult to injury, they locked out hunters from getting the Glaives of Azzinoth, but did nothing to prevent rogues and warriors from using Thori'dal.<br />

Mean ignore the fact the bow was never Hunter only? And there were Warriors and Rogues who were clamoring that NO THIS IS WARRIOR AND ROGUE WEAPON FIRST!!! IT'LL INCREASE OUR DPS/HELP OUR TANKING!!! And that about 50% of the community from posts on wow forums I saw, were actually backing Warriors and Rogues having first rights of rolling?<br />

I know I won't. I'm just saying I would only get the staff because of the ability to turn into a dragon. I would probably not use it for content anyways. I just like those kind of items that change your appearance. I've never been that interested in raiding that much in WoW, or any progression at all.

That fact pisses me off. I dreamed and waited seemingly forever to get my Warglaive set, and I finally got the set at the tail end of BC, which meant my glaives were only usefull to me for maybe 6-8 weeks untill becoming useless for anything other than a cosmetic trifle. After all that work and waiting they are now useless. If memory serves me Blizzard stated that they have no plans to ever make folks Legendariy weapons upgradable to current content. But now they make a Legendary that will be useful forever. That's a smack in the face for everyone who spent months and months working toward their Legendary item, stressing over playing flawlessly, dealing with guild pressures from other candidates, having 100% raid attendance, not to mention all the subtle and not so subtle guild politics involved in becoming the one person the guild leadership deems worthy of such an item. Then a year later it's useless, unless you get this new frigging staff then you have something that has actual usefullness for the life of the game! All Legendary weapons deserver to have something to keep them permanently special for all the hard work and stress it takes to obtain one.</div></div><hr />

I think the name and appearance of the legendary are pretty lacklustre. I mean, a weapon that will reign frosty-fiery-magic death on all that stand in your way does NOT need a word like &quot;rest&quot; in it's god damn name!<br />
The lore will be interesting, for sure. Although while I understand the actual weapon itself being available to the most hardcore (I still cringe every time I have to use terms like casual and hardcore. Even more so when I see someone get called a baddie) of players, I think the story and the quests should really be for everyone. <br />
Good to see the other moon may be making a come back. <br />

<br />
How exactly is this new legendary a smack in the face? It's a staff... it's for DPS, it's new content. Just because you got you warglaives at the tail end of BC doesn't mean you have to be compensated suddenly because they decide a new legendary has a COOL new feature. Seriously... it's just impossible to please everyone without some group of people feeling personally cheated. It's not like they are taking your legendaries from the past away from you.<br />
<br />
Maybe you can roll a caster and try to get THIS new staff instead of wishing your warglaives had more &quot;features.&quot; Guess what, all gear becomes inherently &quot;useless&quot; a year later; not just legendaries. And while I might agree with you that it'd be awesome if legendaries had some future redeeming qualities, there's no point in feeling personally violated over it.</div></div><hr />

Nope, unless it's a proc effect the owner of this staff will get to become a dragon (mount) which will be permanently useful unlike the owners of previous legendary weapons, who got nothing permanent for their hard work.</div></div><hr />

Creates too much competition within guilds and as such could cause guilds to disband.. Also top guilds would be poached like crazy with offers of legendary weapons first from other guilds which again can cause guilds to crash and burn.

Because there have been how many agi Legendary weapons in the last five years? and how many caster damage one hmm?<br />
<br />
All these QQ comments just make me sad, and this is only the first of this expansion, how many Legendries were in the last expansion, two.<br />
<br />
How awesome would it be for a tank Legendary shield of some sort, you don't see many tanks crying because it’s still not there turn do you.<br />

To be honest, Nefarian, even on normal mode, is far from easy. Maybe he is to you now, but many haven't killed him yet. If they have the requirement of having Dragonslayer, Blackwings Bane and Of the Four Winds, it will be the least used legendary ever. :P</div></div><hr />

Really pissing me off.<br />
<br />
dunno if anyone has said this but think about it lorewise. it's all involving the blue dragonflight aspects of magic. doesn't really make sense for them to be like hey i know we are all about magic and stuff but have this weapon we made for meleeing things with</div></div><hr />

Who said I was talking about a hunter? Ferals have never held a Legendary that was useful for their class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not only do you not need to do heroic version you can get this staff doing nothing but 10m normals if you don't mind the much longer acquisition time.</div></div><hr />

Depend of stats. Mage can't be the best to get one. Çets wait and see stats. Remember frost mage &lt;3 Crit and staff shpuld have mastery and something else and haste is better for most of classes out there but not to frost and Fire. Arcane should be &lt;3 op if come with haste and mastery ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
i love this^^</div></div><hr />

Before more than a handful of hunters even had the thing, they changed steady shot in such a way that the Golden Bow of Quel'thelas was actually the superior weapon in most scenarios. That's right, the epic weapon from the same tier was superior to the legendary gained from the final boss of the expansion. Hunters DID get the shaft because people like you can claim that hunters got their weapon, but of course our weapon was awful. Hell, with ammo gone now, even the novelty is gone. Then to add further insult to injury, they locked out hunters from getting the Glaives of Azzinoth, but did nothing to prevent rogues and warriors from using Thori'dal.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, do I sound bitter?<br />
<br />
And Aetish all the way back in vanilla? THAT counts? I assure you there are many more hunters rockin a legendary than casters. There wasnt a caster with aetish on my server and your putitng that up against Thori'dal where you had to kill one damn boss for it, which people DID do. Not to mention the fact that at least your legendary STILL EXISTS in game.<br />
<br />
Hunters have no right to be bitter. It is finally, FINALLY time for casters to have a legendary thats actually obtainable.<br />
<br />
And well done to Haldurion for actually pointing out that a 'caster' weapon = MORE CLASSES TO FIGHT OVER IT THAN THORI'DAL EVER HAD.</div></div><hr />

hm... u are right about that more classes to fight over it but i guess its not good for healers cuse the blizz guy stated that the proc is offensive kind and not good for healers so.. its nearly the same</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amsner</div><div class="date">2011-05-02, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it an all caster type staff or will there be a Feral/Huntard version of it available?<br />
<br />
Its purely for casters, it will have some sort of 'on damaging spell&quot; proc on it, or something that would stop healers from getting it.</div></div><hr />

hes already in the game, so its highly unlikely. currently at the top of wyrmrest temple.<br />
also his model is typical human model nothing updated apart from having blue hair :P</div></div><hr />

I'd like to have seen something more interesting, not go back to old zones, like some stuff in the new zones.<br />
<br />
you know that you are currently trolling. you wont get that staff so why bother comment here?<br />
I am tired of people like you, always complaining and asking for more. Truth is you havent even explored 1/10th of the game and u are just being a troll. so please, stop posting.</div></div><hr />

NO No no, I want it to be set ablaze by that enchant, just image it, a torch that can be seen right from Outland with your bare eyes !</div></div><hr />

That's because &quot;the 4.2 patch&quot; was already in progress, to be thrown at us in 4.1, but instead they changed that, because not many guilds had progress far enough to take on the next challenge.</div></div><hr />

<br />

it's a fucking magical weapon, of course the upgrades to it aren't going to be mundane<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
most likely normal<br />
<br />
Theres a difference between mundane and looking half assed. To me, it looks half assed. I think they could have found a better way to incorporate the horns or other dragon related materials into the staff without it looking like you are a taxidermist.</div></div><hr />
