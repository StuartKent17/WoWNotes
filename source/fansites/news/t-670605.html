Patch 3.2.2 Mount Changes Confirmed<br />
The change I reported yesterday is now confirmed and apparently the price of the riding skills in Dalaran has been hotfixed to match the lowered price in Hellfire. <br />
You guys are correct, we reduced the expert riding skill price in 3.2.2 to 225g. We also changed the faction discounts for the riding skill vendors in Honor Hold and Thrallmar to use Stormwind and Orgrimmar faction.<br />
<br />
There are a couple reasons we made this change. First off, we wanted expert riding to be available to more people at level 60. 600g just did not seem like a reasonable expectation for most level 60 players to have when they roll into Hellfire Peninsula. Especially after purchasing your level 60 skills. The second change, regarding the factions just made a lot more sense this way since you will not have any Thrallmar or Honor Hold faction when you enter Hellfire.<br />
<br />
Finally, I want to apologize for this change not making the patch notes. We strive to get every change we make into the notes but this one somehow slipped by. Once again, my apologies on that, but hopefully the lower price will help make up for it.<br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
Theorycrafting and game balance<br />
Sometimes players aren't seeing the right numbers. Players put a lot of faith in simulations, target dummy tests, data base packages, theorycrafting and simple fights. None of those sources of information are totally invalid. None of them tell the whole story either. Often players are comparing apples and oranges because they are considering a fight which is very good for another class or comparing themselves to an overpowered class who has already gotten nerfs (that do not show up until the next patch). Players also tend to downplay any fight with adds (&quot;trash doesn't matter&quot;) even though there are very few single-target boss fights. Players tend to downplay half of the fights as &quot;gimmick fights&quot; which leaves only Patchwerk and maybe Golemagg.<br />
<br />
Often, player sense of perspective is wrong. The classes are closer than they have been at any time in the history of WoW. Could they be better? Absolutely. But when we read these threads that talk about a class problem (even low dps) as being the Worst Thing Ever That Has Always Been This Way, they sort of lose some of their credibility. There are some specs who we see as legitimately not making it into PvE groups very often (such as Frost mages and Demo locks) and some specs that just don't feel very viable in PvP (such as Prot warriors or Fire Mages). Many of the other &quot;am being sat&quot; anecdotes are overblown.<br />
<br />
Often, we have made a fix and players just haven't seen it yet because the next build isn't out. It is very telling right now that there are a lot of &quot;I logged into the game, tried hitting something for 5 seconds and didn't notice a dps increase&quot; threads. What we deal with a lot are trends, and trends can take a lot of time to emerge.<br />
<br />
Sometimes we even agree something is a problem, but A) aren't sure how we want to fix it yet, B) think that an upcoming change will fix the problem, or C) are just focused on other problems at the moment. You can ask why we won't at least acknowledge a problem even if we have no immediate plans to fix it. But ask yourself if you would be one of those people who would post &quot;Why won't you fix it if you know it's a problem?&quot; :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20136595059-disconnect-between-devs--community.html))<br />

Harvest Festival and Violet Proto-Drake<br />
Harvest Festival and Pilgrim's Bounty are two different holidays.<br />
<br />
That said, the point of What a Long, Strange Trip It's Been is to experience all the holidays in its requirements, so we won't likely change it to be an 8 of 9 situation, and Pilgrim's Bounty is currently planned to remain off the meta achievement. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20122734366-regarding-pilgrims-bounty-and-violet-proto.html))<br />
<br />
New &quot;buff&quot; drums/scrolls in 3.2.2<br />
As a few players have pointed out, the reason we gave up back-up versions of Kings, Gift and Fort is because those affect the health of the tank. It is difficult to balance how hard bosses can hit when tank health varies with and without those buffs (again generally talking hard modes here for appropriate geared groups). There aren't many situations where Bloodlust / Heroism will absolutely make the difference between making or failing a dps check. It can be really advantageous in some situations though, such as blowing up a faction champions healer quickly.<br />
<br />
Offering a drum (or whatever) version of BL / Heroism isn't totally off the table, but as we've said before, we don't want to have to go to Shadow Protection or Spirit consumables or whatever. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20133924379-bring-the-player-not-the-class-heroismbl.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif [color=#2459FF]Shaman<br />
Chain Lightning<br />
We don't want shamans to just push CL in all situations. We don't think that will be the case though. If you're a very sophisticated shaman and want to cycle in CL sometimes against single targets for a marginal but legitimate dps increase, there is nothing at all wrong with that.<br />
<br />
I think some of our best class designs come out when a mediocre player can get X performance out of the class with a simple rotation, but an exceptional players can coax slightly &gt; X damage by doing a more complex rotation. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20122254442-cl-now-in-an-ele-shamans-rotation.html))</div></div><hr />

Wondering about the champion damage reduction in normal modes though.<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
Arcane Barrage now deals 11565 damage over 15 sec (Down from 13875) and causes 20817 to 24183 damage if dispelled. (Down from 24975 to 29025 damage)<br />
<br />
Sounds like Unstable Affliction rather than Arcane Barrage to me. :P<br />
PS. WTB dot with UA effect for Arcane Barrage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is most likely to prevent some of the setups to be nearly impossible to do.<br />
<br />
With the warlock's Hellfire ticking for 5.5k every -second-, the melee will get ripped apart if they're not paying attention, or got aggro from any of the other mobs.<br />
<br />
That's the only one I think is really needed though, but the other nerfs are going to make it a bit easier to heal.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the Twin buff, I think it was really needed for the same reason as above. People could ignore the heal completely, and still make it without any troubles.</div></div><hr />

Erm, did you even read it completely? The UA nerf was to the Faction Champion warlock ability, not the player ability.</div></div><hr />

Then I realized it didn't apply to player abilities at all, just the ones for the ToC reg/heroic.</div></div><hr />

Actually, you're correct, I didn't have 1000g, I had about 3000g when I dinged 60.<br />

<br />
<br />
As a player from Vanilla, I can tell you it's changed drastically (for the better IMO). Back in Vanilla money was a lot harder to get, only raiders and grinders had epic mounts. Grinding back then was HELL. I think I remember a friend of mine farming Burning Steppes for 15g an hour, and that was good money. I think I used to farm Scarlet Monastery for 20g-25g per run of the entire place, back in those days burst was a lot smaller so things didn't die as fast. With how much easier it is to make money, 5000g isn't a lot.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone is going to be savvy with the AH. I know a guy that honestly hates trying to play the AH game. Even if it's his first character on the server. He gets his money out of dailies, and he ends up having more money than me at times.<br />
<br />
And while a lot of the leveling in Outland is going to be an alt nowadays, it's still nothing more than a quality of life change that's going to help, especially with Death Knights. Heck, I think my Death Knight could easily get 225g without much hassle while questing in Hellfire. Getting that much money, plus the discount, isn't going to be hard for characters that might not like to play the Auction House game.<br />
<br />
And honestly, thinking back to pre-BC with stuff like this won't help very much. Things have changed and the money to get all the stuff we want in Wrath is daunting. Might as well slim prices on stuff that everyone will eventually need.</div></div><hr />

And from the sound of it you didn't really enjoy doing that, and I don't think anyone did. So what's the point of hours of stupid senseless grinding for gold?<br />

<br />
Move faster. Yes it's alot of dmg when the fire ticks once and his whirl ticks at the same time, but you won't die from it unless you just dinged 80 in lvl 70 gear and have crap for hp and no buffs. Hell it might even be possible to avoid the tick entirely if you move fast enough from the fire graphic. I've never managed that, but I've never taken more than 1 tick from it before moving out of it.<br />
<br />
All that aside, the change is probably for the better, it was a bit too rng and favored those with the best possible computers/connections.</div></div><hr />

It makes it even easier for people who don't know how to strafe out of fire I guess.. &quot;Oh snaps I'm standing in the fire, I better keyboard turn my character around and run away from it before I dies&quot;</div></div><hr />

That is a good thing. Keeps the scrubs with cheesy tactics away from the loot.<br />
<br />
This change was made because guilds were using tactics against the mechanics of the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Such as just focusing DPS on 1 target, and ignoring the heal on the other. Got around the DPS requirement on the shield completely.<br />
<br />
Anyway, who else expects the next nerf to be the melee mobs in faction champions having their ability to crit against clothies removed? You KNOW more raids in Col fail to that than anything else....</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FireBorne</div><div class="date">2009-09-27, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faction champion nerfs were well deserved for heroic but not at all for regular. That is the WORST encounter in the game imo if you get the wrong set up you are pretty much fucked so now maybe vent will be alot quieter when we get the war/sham/rogue/dk/tree/lock or some other ridiculous aoe heavy group. I dont arena for a reason as do most other raiders but the few that do loves this fight so i understand why it is there but ultimately if this was a push to get more ppl to think &quot;wow this is cool we should start a 5v5&quot; they have failed.</div></div><hr />

I just wanna say, for a low health, non healing class like my mage, if I coped a fire half way through a Burning Breath I would die, no matter how fast I tried to strafe jump outta the flames. There was just nothing I could do after using my first health stone or iceblocking, even with Fire ward up.<br />
I would see the flame, straight away start strafing and jump but would catch the first tick and die.<br />
<br />
Now on a melee class with 22k+ you will probably live through one tick but for my mage it was just RNG death nothing I could do to prevent it. <br />
<br />
So its a good change imo</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andy_mitchelluk</div><div class="date">2009-09-28, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for the mount price changes, I think it's about time.<br />
<br />
Don't forget the training is for flying which is now available 10 levels earlier.<br />
Also, when most of us long time players got our flying, we were 70, locked at 70 where the dailies and other quests offered the full amount of gold.<br />
<br />
I know dailies are how I got my flying mount back at 70 and with the fact they offer a lot less now the cap is 80 it really isn't a great option.<br />
<br />
The majority of the players just wont have that kind of money at 60 unless they're hardcore farmers or they buy the gold.<br />
<br />
IMHO this is another step towards reducing the amount of gold that's purchased and that can only be seen as a good thing for the long run.<br />
<br />
Ofc actually banning the goldsellers all together would be better but that's not going to happen anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

Not saying it's a bad change in the least, just makes it easier for the people that can't push keybinds and pay attention to debuffs at the same time. Or the giant blue text saying GTFOF tard! :P</div></div><hr />

Well my warlock usually has about 25k hp in decent pve gear with the usual raid buffs (kings, fortitude) - which it's possible to get from scrolls now btw. I'm also specced for 20% damage reduction which probably helps (and is really easy for most warlocks to do). So most reasonably geared clothies should be somewhere in that region, but newly-dinged 80's won't be, and I guess the idea is to let them do the fight too.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-09-28, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Move faster. Yes it's alot of dmg when the fire ticks once and his whirl ticks at the same time, but you won't die from it unless you just dinged 80 in lvl 70 gear and have crap for hp and no buffs. Hell it might even be possible to avoid the tick entirely if you move fast enough from the fire graphic. I've never managed that, but I've never taken more than 1 tick from it before moving out of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
You OBVIOUSLY don't play a healer. It doesn't matter if the tick happened in the last 2-3 seconds and you moved right away if you still have a heal incoming. This was a nice change for the healers (because as a healer watching people die just sucks ass). Maybe some day Blizzard will stop balancing raiding on the back of healers. Then again, if they do that they might require DPS to actually have skill, and well they will never do that.</div></div><hr />
