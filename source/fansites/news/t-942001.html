World of Warcraft: Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects Now Available!<br />
Written by New York Times bestselling author Christie Golden, the new novel Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects follows the former War Chief of the Horde as he struggles with the ongoing repercussions of the Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
When Azeroth was young, the noble titans appointed the five great dragonflights to safeguard the budding world. Each of the flights' leaders was imbued with a portion of the titans' vast cosmic powers. Together, these majestic Dragon Aspects committed themselves to thwarting any force that threatened the safety of the World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Over ten thousand years ago, a betrayal by the maddened black Dragon Aspect, Deathwing, shattered the strength and unity of the dragonflights. His most recent assault on Azeroth—the Cataclysm—has left the world in turmoil. At the Maelstrom, the center of Azeroth's instability, former Horde warchief Thrall and other accomplished shaman struggle to keep the world from tearing apart in the wake of Deathwing's attack. Yet a battle also rages within Thrall regarding his new life in the shamanic Earthen Ring, hampering his normally unparalleled abilities.<br />
<br />
Unable to focus on his duties, Thrall undertakes a seemingly menial task from an unexpected source: the mysterious green Dragon Aspect, Ysera. This humble endeavor soon becomes a journey spanning the lands of Azeroth and the timeways of history itself, bringing Thrall into contact with ancient dragonflights. Divided by conflict and mistrust, these dragons have become easy prey to a horrific new weapon unleashed by Deathwing's servants . . . a living nightmare engineered to exterminate Azeroth's winged guardians.<br />
<br />
Of even greater concern is a bleak and terrifying possible future glimpsed by Ysera: the Hour of Twilight. Before this apocalyptic vision comes to pass, Thrall must purge his own doubts in order to discover his purpose in the world and aid Azeroth's dragonflights as they face the Twilight of the Aspects.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects is now available at local and online book retailers!<br />

Adding more Battlegrounds to the game<br />
We’d like to. We certainly haven't forgotten about the PvP community at all and we do a lot of PvP oriented behind the scenes work right now. While not very much of that effort is channeled into creating new maps at the moment, we would definitely like to increase the variety of Battleground and Arena maps that are available in the future. That's where things get sticky, though. One might think that creating a Battleground is a pretty simple process (they look simple, right?), but it's not.<br />
<br />
Part of the reason is that Battlegrounds are like ducks. A duck looks like it effortlessly glides across the water, but their little feet are actually working madly beneath the surface to make it happen. Battlegrounds are the same way. They may look simple -- even static -- to a casual observer, but in reality there's an incredible number of very complicated processes going on behind the scenes. Part of the reason for this is due to a lot of technical hurdles that need to be jumped to make them perform as seamlessly as they do, battle after battle. As a result, it's actually extremely difficult to design Battlegrounds, partially due to the technical limitations that are currently in place.<br />
<br />
The other part of the reason is that Battlegrounds (and Arena maps, for that matter) require a higher degree of polish than a PvE map does. If a bit of geometry causes you to hang up, or blocks line of sight in a dungeon or raid, then in the majority of circumstances you can probably just work around it until it's fixed. If the same flaw exists in a bg or arena map, then that imperfection might be exploited for an unfair advantage, which runs contrary to the spirit of fair competition we want in that kind of PvP. We know that a lot of the PvP community is ultimately more interested in having perfectly balanced and bug-free maps to play on, than they necessarily are in having new maps to play on.<br />
<br />
The other thing to keep in mind is that, while boss mechanics might differ from raid to raid, broadly speaking all dungeons and raids have the same rule set (that is, they have raid locks and you have to run back to the portal when you wipe and so on). BGs and Arenas tend to have highly individual rule sets. The result is that, in addition to the factors I’ve already mentioned, we also have to craft every BG essentially by hand every time. We’d like to develop a tool to create PvP maps in the same way we have a tool we can use to create bosses or a tool we can use to create items. Such a tool would let us create BGs and other PvP-oriented maps more readily. That's something that we're working toward now, but it's time consuming and exacting work, and still quite a ways off.<br />
<br />
Still, ultimately we think all this effort will pay off, and we're confident that you'll feel the same way. In the meantime, there are still plenty of players of the opposing faction to send back to the Spirit Healer, and we hope you can continue to have fun making red dead wherever you find it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/186845/more-bgs-pl0x) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2869437246?page=1#8))<br />
<br />
Need &gt; Greed &gt; Disenchant<br />
Need: I need that piece of gear and will wear it/use it in my appropriate spec<br />
Greed: I do not need that piece of gear and will probably not use it. I will most likely Vendor it or perhaps wear it &quot;for pretty&quot;<br />
Disenchant: I don't even want to bother vendoring this. I would rather the materials that is made up of. I have great use of the disenchanted item than the original<br />
I think this is a pretty fair diagnosis of the current functionality. I'd also note though that group communication is really important. If you're unsure about whether or not you should be rolling Need on an item instead of Greed/Disenchant, communicate with the party and let them know of your intent.<br />
<br />
The system for rolling on items isn't perfect and doesn't have built-in functionality for off-spec rolls, etc., but part of this is because we expect there should be at least some base level of communication between the players, particularly if anyone in the group is running dungeons for items and not just the points. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/186858/need-%3E-greed-%3E-disenchant) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2872617765?page=2#21))<br />
<br />
Communication prevents a lot of heartache in dungeons I find ;)<br />
Agreed. And for what it's worth, I'm sure we could implement enough rolling options that we could effectively remove any need to ever communicate with the party about what your intent behind each roll is -- the intent would be made clear by the button you press. Sometimes more options aren't always good though. We want the system to be useful and sensible, but not so comprehensive that it ends up being muddled and complicated.<br />
<br />
We think the current options are pretty sufficient. If you need the item for your current spec, roll Need. If you can use the item for off-spec, roll Need, but perhaps wait for everyone else to roll first, and/or let the group know why you want to roll Need. If you have an enchanter in your group and you can use mats, roll Disenchant. If you don't need the item or the mats, or you don't have an enchanter in the group, roll Greed for a chance at some extra gold.<br />
<br />
Even while queuing for random dungeons solo, I've virtually never run into any major loot disputes or issues. Particularly at this point in the expansion, a lot of players are running Heroics primarily for the JP/VP. Most players understand why you're rolling Need with little to no communication necessary. It's not hard to ascertain, for example, that a DPS death knight is rolling Need on a tanking item for off-spec, and not just to be a jerk. Provided that death knight is accommodating to the tank in the party before rolling, or at least makes an agreement with the tank in advance that they can roll against each other, it's all gravy. ;) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/186858/need-%3E-greed-%3E-disenchant) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2872617765?page=3#58))<br />
<br />
Do I need to read the new book to figure out what's happening in-game?<br />
We work to make sure that there is balance between what you can learn in game versus the books. That said, the books do allow a bit more insight than you normally could get via the game, but that has to do with the fact that books and games (while they can both deliver story) tell the story in different ways. Hopefully, for those that don't choose to read the books, they can learn what they wish or need in the game itself. For those who have the time and inclination to read the books, they can get a bit more back story and depth that they may not feel is complete enough for them in the game.

Death Strike Hotfix<br />
The Death Strike hotfix was intended as a buff to single target Blood DK damage. Normally it’s not a big deal if one tank class does slightly higher or lower damage than other tank classes (as long as threat isn’t a problem), but when you have mechanics that greatly inflate tank damage, then it can be a bigger problem.<br />
<br />
We discussed buffing Heart Strike or other attacks, but one of the concerns we commonly hear from Blood DKs is they feel torn about spending runes on Death Strike versus other abilities, and we didn't want to change their rotation in the middle of a patch, just modestly buff their damage. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/186846/death-strike-hotfix) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2872937349?page=4#67))<br />
<br />
[...] For clarification's sake, we intended to increase critical strike chance. Improved Death Strike was not changed, merely buffed.<br />
<br />
The hotfix was applied quite recently, so those of you who did not notice the improvement last night are correct. You can see the updated hotfix note here: (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/186846/death-strike-hotfix) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2872937349?page=4#71))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Improved Death Strike now provides 40/80/120% bonus damage, up from 30/60/90%, and a 10/20/30% critical strike chance, up from 3/6/9%.<br />

<br />
<br />
I didn't think Rise of the Lich King butchered the lore. Mind providing some example? All I got from it was a look into Arthas' thoughts and personality behind his actions throughout his life. That's expanding on the lore or causing a review of what you know of the lore, not butchering it.<br />
<br />
Of course, I haven't read it in a while. So, explain what leads you to your conclusion, please.</div></div><hr />

They really have lost the plot and seem to have no idea of even basic social concepts.<br />
<br />
Sure amongst friends, or 'colleagues' such as guildies during raids, you can have a reasonable discussion on where loot should go. You have a connection with these people and a responsibility to get things right, and repercussions if you try to take advantage of them.<br />
<br />
But in a random dungeon finder group, with random people, from random realms, who you are unlikely to ever meet again and owe absolutely nothing to? It is just laughable that they expect &quot;proper communication&quot; to be used. If you throw random people together, you need to have systems in place to organize loot. They know this, hence why you can't need everything that drops. To place all responsibility on the players given these circumstances is at best a cop out and at worst willful neglect of their player base.</div></div><hr />

If an off-spec piece drops for me I usually wait to see what everyone else rolls (if there are people in the group who can use it for main spec) and if they don't need it, I'll say &quot;Needing for o/s&quot; and hit Need. Naturally if I'm the only plate wearer in the group then I just hit Need for it as there's nobody else who can use it so the reason I'm rolling is obvious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
for those that don't choose to read the books, they can learn what they wish or need in the game itself. For those who have the time and inclination to read the books, they can get a bit more back story and depth that they may not feel is complete enough for them in the game.<br />
<br />
Most of the story is told in the game, books allow you to flesh out the story a bit more.</div></div><hr />

They really have lost the plot and seem to have no idea of even basic social concepts.<br />
<br />
Sure amongst friends, or 'colleagues' such as guildies during raids, you can have a reasonable discussion on where loot should go. You have a connection with these people and a responsibility to get things right, and repercussions if you try to take advantage of them.<br />
<br />
But in a random dungeon finder group, with random people, from random realms, who you are unlikely to ever meet again and owe absolutely nothing to? It is just laughable that they expect &quot;proper communication&quot; to be used. If you throw random people together, you need to have systems in place to organize loot. They know this, hence why you can't need everything that drops. To place all responsibility on the players given these circumstances is at best a cop out and at worst willful neglect of their player base.<br />
<br />
In pugs, people should be willing to have some sense of common decency...oh wait it ran away with common sense, nevermind. Honestly, I think its sad that Blizzard has been forced to put in place a loot system, and with every year it seems make it even stricter. I think it should go without saying if you don't fucking need something, don't fucking need it.</div></div><hr />

I don't agree. Most information might be available in the game through some obscure quest line that most people won't have done, but personally I had no idea that Nozdormu was back and I was quite surprised when I saw him during the Thrall quest line. And who's Aggra? I've never heard of her before, and suddenly she's getting married to Thrall. That information was not made available to me through the game.</div></div><hr />

That along with the &quot;need for off-spec&quot; ninja destroys pugs. Fix those two issues and you have a solid and smooth progress through dungeons. Yeah, there is a third type of ninja but it is very rare and requires a special type of person. That ninja doesn't roll need to use the item or to vendor it. They only roll need so you can't have the item. Very rare so most people don't need to worry about that kind. However the two first ninja types can easily be fixed if Blizzard would just remove their thumb from the ass. Seriously they go on about making &quot;new&quot; haircuts or showing the map visually when you look at the map. If they spent only a little of all that effort on the loot system, heirloom server transfers it would have been done long ago. What's next useless thing to work on?

We want the system to be useful and sensible, but not so comprehensive that it ends up being muddled and complicated. We think the current options are pretty sufficient. If you need the item for your current spec, roll Need. If you can use the item for off-spec, roll Need, but perhaps wait for everyone else to roll first, and/or let the group know why you want to roll Need. How is it less complicated to wait and ask and weaver weather you can roll or not or maybe not plus others bothering or not to reply for you than just have one more button?</div></div><hr />

I really dont care much for boss drops these days anyway I get most my gear from vendors and crafting which Ill always like better.

So much for Blizz saying they'll put more BGs in Cata then any of the other expansions. Oh well Im having fun with the 2 new BGs anyway. Cant wait for the book.</div></div><hr />

That's just it... the looting system isn't bad, it's just that people complain about anything, even the smallest detail. You'll always have a vocal minority that for some reason gets upset over rolling on greens. It's an MMO, it's a social game, you're playing with other random people. Somehow people don't make this connection. Could the loot be done different, maybe better? Sure it could, but most people wouldn't think twice about the loot system simply because it works fine and has worked for a long time.</div></div><hr />

Actually I'm as nice ingame as I am out of game, and always friendly and social. But that doesn't change the facts regarding how others behave and why. This issue was never as big when Blizzard helped the community police itself. They took away that ability, so now they have to step up to the plate themselves.</div></div><hr />
