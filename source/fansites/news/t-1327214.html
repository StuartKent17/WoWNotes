People thought they would get something they didn't get. That it sold that well was all thanks to D2's success, and had nothing, NOTHING to do with D3 actually being a game worth buying.<br />
<br />
The failures of D3 were massive, from Error 37 to the abyssmal item system and the horrendous designchoice that all revolved around the auction house, to the story that was so shallow I felt embarrased with characters so predictable and dumb that I groaned.<br />
Yet they seem to forget that. No, they sold good and that's all they think matters. And that is just another part of all the things they've done wrong.</div></div><hr />

The hate is precisely because it's not D2, it's not D1, it's none of the fantastic games that Blizzard has built their reputation on. It's /okay/, but okay is terrible in comparison to the standard they've set. We expect better than okay from Blizzard, and D3 simply did not live up to the hype... or the wait. TitanQuest and Path of Exile have both been better D3s than Actual D3 is, and that is a tremendous shame.<br />

Granted, I don't think D3 was crap, it was pretty good, but you know what they say about opinions.<br />

Most people that cry about diablo 3 are either band wagoners who whine about whatever is popular to whine about at the moment, or people who thought it was going to be like wow. Diablo 2 wasn't that good until the expansion and diablo 3 may be the same. Diablo 3 wasn't the best game ever, but that is your own fault for hyping yourself up like that. The only big flaw i see with diablo 3 is that it was too short, but who knows maybe an expansion will fix that.</div></div><hr />

Tencent: I think Patch 5.4 is the last patch in this expansion. Have you started next expansion? Will it be announced in this year's BlizzCon?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Patch 5.4 is the last content patch, but we will release some bug fixes and balancing patchs after that. We will also release a preview content patch before new expansion. BlizzCon is a good time to tell something about that.<br />
<br />
From the interview, one could interpret GC's answer in different ways. There could either be a 5.5 minor patch or no patch at all before 6.0 hits<br />

No - in LFR they added loot chest (for every boss) at the start of the instance. C'mon LFR ist easy as shit - and im far away from beeing a elitist or hard core gamer.<br />

What ppl don't understand in regard to D3 is it looks like Blizz got a lobotomy after D2:LoL ... what is the reason that yet again an expansion has to fix a Blizz game. Anyway. With Titan not being a subscription based MMO it can be good news for WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice to see positive numbers for both D3 had WoW (yes they are both incredible figures respectively). <br />
<br />
Personally, I found D3 too short lived. It was a shame (at release) its endgame was so sparse on options.</div></div><hr />

Seriously the launch was extremely bad and I wasn't even able to log in on most days after launch because of the Error 37.<br />
<br />
Sadly the game was way too short and predictable and insanity was actually kinda easy even without mega powerful AH gear. Diablo possessing Leah was also kinda predictable from the beginning of the game (especially if one has seen the female Diablo Artwork). The story was pretty simplistic too and sometimes I think that a kid wrote that story.<br />
<br />
If I hadn't gotten the game for free with the Annual-pass I would have felt scammed for my money with that terribad launch and short campaign.</div></div><hr />

Probably, but bad news for people who were hoping that new game would be good. I don't think anything decent can come out of non subscription MMO. It would probably come with many small paid content patches and/or pay to win.</div></div><hr />

If Blizz is postponing Titan to release a b2p p2w MMO then it will be bad. But you losing hope in Blizz has nothing to do with the game not being subscription based. It just means you don't trust Blizz is capable of making anything but a subscription based MMORPGs. <br />

Most people that cry about diablo 3 are either band wagoners who whine about whatever is popular to whine about at the moment, or people who thought it was going to be like wow. Diablo 2 wasn't that good until the expansion and diablo 3 may be the same. Diablo 3 wasn't the best game ever, but that is your own fault for hyping yourself up like that. The only big flaw i see with diablo 3 is that it was too short, but who knows maybe an expansion will fix that.<br />

There are 2 Flaws in Diablo: Lootdrops are utter crap. Way too many idiotic stat combinations. In my playtime from Lv 1 to to paragon 2 I got ZERO good items dropped. All good stuff I got from the AH.<br />
Sorry but that's no fun at all.<br />

The second flaw of Diablo is the ridiculously retarded ending. (Ofc since they wanted an X-pac...)<br />

Nope sir. Perhaps you should choose better your examples for showing your superior education and knowledge.<br />
<br />
Every premium Tank in WoT performs worse in battle than a regular tank of the same tier fully upgraded. A Tiger II is better than a Löwe, and an IS-3 is better thann a IS-6. <br />
<br />
They are just good at earning credits and experience for the crews. In other words, convienience items, just like the Xp elixir with the exception that in a monthly paid game, conviniency should come at no extra costs.</div></div><hr />

You can laugh until you're blue in the face. Not going to change that D3 was successful. This is a cycle that occurs for every game sequel known to man. Diablo 3 didn't meet EVERYone's expectations, so the old fanboys complain and the new ones arrive so that they can complain about Diablo 4 when that comes around.<br />

I'm surprise that you are the only person talking about this, and then you troll about it.<br />
<br />
It's obviously going to be some kind of bonus drop from Garrosh: Flexible, normal and heroic. No LFR version right now, so this might just be that &quot;extra&quot; to promote raiding beyond LFR as Blizzard previously talked about.<br />
<br />
If this is the case, this is actually pretty cool, 1 item (or 2 with offhand) per alt is more than enough to make people want to go in Flexible and Normal. So people will understand they need to work a little to get some free gifts, unlike the general philosophy of LFR. This could help change the mentality of LFR playerbase.</div></div><hr />

Hehe..I guess for now they are happy they sold 12 million - by whatever means. man..I regret falling for the hype around &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;^^<br />
What consumers REALLY think we shall see by the sale figures of a possible x-pac. But mind this: People rave on how fantastic D2 was. It sold 4.5 million copies, yet the x-pac LOD only sold a third of that: 1,5 million. Means..we have all kinds of interpretions open if, when and how a D3 x-pac sells.<br />

It was common in D2 since its single player you get to keep your characters in D3 you get caught editing the files its pretty much gone.

Yes. God forbid that a company actually takes action against cheaters in their game.<br />
D2 was singleplayer.<br />
D3 isnt. It is a multiplayer with a singleplayer option.<br />

There's a patch after it to appoint the new warchief (whether it's 5.5 or 5.4.5 doesn't matter, it will happen).<br />
There's also a small possilibity of another pvp season before the new expansion (prideful gear was datamined and connects with SoO).<br />
<br />
All of that if you just read ghostcrawler and other dev accounts on a daily basis.<br />
Any of that stuff could come in a 6.0 patch. Just like a lot of stuff happened in 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0. Who knows though. The biggest support I've seen for a 5.5 patch is that GC mentioned a balance patch which would need to come before 6.0 hits.</div></div><hr />

You also didnt mention you can buy the best ammo for cash<br />
<br />
You can´t upgrade a premium tank. All its modules are stock, forever, and forever the tank will be worse in battle than a regular tank. It just earns more ingame credits than a regular one.<br />
<br />
You also didn´t mention taht you can buy the best ammo AND the best consumables for cash and since many months ago FOR CREDITS, which are available in game for everyone. <br />
<br />
WoT has the best F2P system, in wich a free player can eventually get the best tank in the game and load it up with the best ammo and the best consumables, without a single disadvantage in battle with a premium user; it will just take more time and a slower ccredit farming. Now WoW goes the same way while you must keep paying the sub.<br />

Blizz had years to copyright dota before the 2nd came out, time to bite the bullet and understand they failed to claim one of the biggest games ever and put those devs working on the game to better use.</div></div><hr />

If anything, all this talk about how a mediocre (at best) D3 has sold north of 12 million copies would teach you that if Blizzard puts something out that it will sell. I doubt Blizzard is afraid of LoL or DotA. Between SC, D3 and WoW they are just printing money at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
5.4 last content patch.<br />
There's a patch after it to appoint the new warchief (whether it's 5.5 or 5.4.5 doesn't matter, it will happen).<br />
There's also a small possilibity of another pvp season before the new expansion (prideful gear was datamined and connects with SoO).<br />
<br />
All of that if you just read ghostcrawler and other dev accounts on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
I'm confused as to what you're arguing about. You confirmed what I said in your post. Last CONTENT patch. Which means there will be no other CONTENT in this expansion aside from the pre patch for the next expansion. So, like I said, like they have said, no 5.5. You'll take your 6.0 and you'll like it.</div></div><hr />

Plus I think there's plenty of room to experiment in the genre instead of just putting out a carbon-copy of a copy of a mod. Dawngate's not afraid to murder standard MOBA conventions and play on a completely different map, and SMITE plays out vastly different by virtue of being a third-person game.<br />
<br />
A game where the average match lasts 15-20 minutes and yet still feels fulfilling would totally be welcome. We'll just have to wait and see what the current state of the game looks like.</div></div><hr />

Not going to change that D3 was successful. This is a cycle that occurs for every game sequel known to man. Diablo 3 didn't meet EVERYone's expectations, so the old fanboys complain and the new ones arrive so that they can complain about Diablo 4 when that comes around.<br />
<br />
Blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
K? To bad my laughing has nothing to do with D3 at all but the logic of fanbois.<br />

A fully upgraded F2P tank is slightly better than a non upgraded premium tank? <br />
<br />
Shocking. <br />
<br />
What if i upgrade my premium tank?<br />
<br />
You also didnt mention you can buy the best ammo for cash<br />
<br />
So ignore how I said &quot;every&quot; and just put &quot;WoT&quot; there?<br />

Move to another server? My server is mega packed with 100s of raiding guilds, tons of PVP. Pugs for everything and Guilds galore.<br />
<br />
They added guilds and raiding to D3?</div></div><hr />

Have to admit I found that one kind of amusing, considering how many have been lost over these patches. Shows the level of PR guff that companies put in these conference calls.</div></div><hr />

None of them LFR level. Our Legendary is a cloak... these weapons are from the final boss... this is like making all of Deathwing's loot BTA. In a way makes a hell of a lot of sense.</div></div><hr />

Having a subscription on a game wards off all the nubcakes, and if you play F2P games, it's clearly presented by the attitude of the players on that game. As well as this, I'd rather pay £8.99 a month than have to feel like I have to buy stuff from an ingame store to keep up with the game/accelerate my gameplay. I really hope they rethink this change in business model :\</div></div><hr />
