2.8 million copies in 24 hours ... no wonder why my Saronite is selling so fast at the auction house. <br />
IRVINE, Calif. - November 20, 2008 - Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today announced that World of Warcraft®'s second expansion, Wrath of the Lich King™, has sold more than 2.8 million copies in its first 24 hours of availability*, making it the fastest-selling PC game of all time. This eclipses the previous record of nearly 2.4 million copies sold in 24 hours, set in January 2007 by Blizzard's first World of Warcraft expansion, The Burning Crusade®. Wrath of the Lich King was simultaneously released in North America, Europe, Chile, Argentina, and Russia on November 13; Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand on November 14; and South Korea and the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau on November 18.<br />
<br />
In celebration of the launch, more than 15,000 stores throughout the world had their doors open at midnight to welcome thousands of expectant players. Several of these locations were attended by Blizzard Entertainment representatives, who met players and signed copies of the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're grateful for the incredible support that players around the world have continued to show for World of Warcraft,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. “Wrath of the Lich King contains some of the best content we’ve created for the game so far, and we look forward to seeing even more players log in to experience it in the days ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After a single day of availability, Wrath of the Lich King is already the bestselling PC game of 2008 at GameStop and ranks as one of our top-selling products so far this year,&quot; said Bob McKenzie, GameStop’s senior vice president of merchandising. &quot;In keeping with the tradition established by their previous releases, Blizzard Entertainment has again created a product that not only reflects their high standards of quality but is clearly an instant hit with gamers around the country.&quot;<br />
<br />
Prior to the launch of Wrath of the Lich King, World of Warcraft’s subscriber population had grown to more than 11 million players, further strengthening its position as the world's most popular subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game.

They definitely deserve the best selling game of all time over The Sims, they put so much more effort into WoW than Maxis did with the Sims which is really just a con, they add in a huge amount of expansions for the Sims one, then the second one is back to basics! Absolute con, at least Blizzard put all the love into one game and patch it up constantly.<br />

I was 5 of those 2.8 million ;)<br />
<br />
But yes, the expansion itself exceeded my expectations. The content was very, very well done. Here's hoping they keep on that track.</div></div><hr />

I am glad I was part of the 2.8 million people, who braved the late night hour last Wednesday night and got my copy of Wrath of the Lich King... I was also glad to see so many other fellow WoW players at the Gamestop store I went to... Took me about 30-45 mins in line to get my copy... Hope to go back and get the Collector's Edition very soon... Great job on the expansion, Blizzard!!! Hope to see another great expansion in the future!!! ;D ;D ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
11mil.<br />
<br />
Blizz only counts paying subscribers and nut frozen/suspended/banned accounts.<br />
<br />
And in their eye's, if you pay you play, even if it's only 2/3 hours a week.</div></div><hr />

How many points did they get for that one?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Was one of those in the first 24 hours, but I realise not everybody is that active or curious.<br />
<br />
I wasn't active at all. Same goes for my brother and 2 of his friends. Also one of my own friends didn't think too much of it and wanted to stay with Warhammer Online. Guess how many people are playing again ^^. Allot of people might be complaining or expecting it can't be that great since it's only an expansion, or expecting something like TBC which they liked but wasn't that smashing. Guess they need to find out how brilliant this game is. I had high expectations but still got more than i expected.<br />
<br />
Guess i'm still a big Blizz fanboy :P. Gratz Blizzard, job well done!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kartu3</div><div class="date">2008-11-21, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another marketing BS, I don't see anything ot boast about. Yes, Wow has 11 million subscribers, cool. But who cares how quickly did they buy the expansion? Wow was quite empty in anticipation of WOTLK for month already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
because 90% of the gameshop haven't done the event/canno't sell them 12 evenining (taked mine 12 evening @blockbuster 21:00); infa the first night of exping was a wet dream, om my server (1000+ queue) was 20-30 pax in hf (sw ship bugged so 10-15 ppl on bt).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chiper</div><div class="date">2008-11-21, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Impressive first day figures, but I'm more interested in the days following. Specifically, how many of those 11 million players have upgraded so far. I'm betting it's more then half.<br />
<br />
Damn I wish I could afford Activ/Blizz stock. The dividends on this are gonna be huge.</div></div><hr />
