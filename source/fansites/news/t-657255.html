Community Team: We’d like to start things off by asking a question that players often ask in regard to the very purpose of each class. In this case, we’re looking specifically at warriors, which have been stalwart base for comparisons since the start of World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Q. Where do warriors fit into the larger scope of things currently and where do you see them going from this point forward?<br />
<br />
A. Historically, warriors have always been one of the most dominant classes in World of Warcraft. In Molten Core and for raids afterwards, warriors were THE tank, no question. DPS warriors could also top the damage meters, and were a very potent PvP force. We think we allowed the warrior class to overshadow some other classes, which is probably to be expected given the iconic nature of the plate-wearing fighter in RPGs that long preceded World of Warcraft. We think they are in a fairer place now, in that there is room on the stage for other classes, yet they are still a very powerful and popular class to play. The warrior class has been a very tricky one to balance, largely due to the way rage converts into damage (which converts into rage, which converts into damage...), and we haven’t completely nailed that design just yet.<br />
<br />
One of the things we want to do in the future is take a hard look at the Arms and Fury trees. There are several talents which just haven’t weathered the course of time well and pale in comparison to some of the newer Wrath of the Lich King talents. We’re happiest with the Protection tree -- we made a conscious effort to pare down that tree and remove a lot of mandatory talents in order to give the warrior more flexibility to take some more fun or utility-oriented talents. We need to make the same pass on the dps side of things. The reason we haven’t done so yet is that warrior dps is in a pretty good place and we don’t want to have to dilute the class across the board just to make some talents a little sexier. We will eventually do this though. We also need to make some decisions about the difference between Arms and Fury. Traditionally, Arms was the PvP tree and Fury was the PvE tree. We understand some players prefer that model, but we don’t like the way it cuts off such a big chunk of the class from players who might not have much interest in the PvP or PvE parts of the game. However, we would like to reinforce a little more the kits of Arms and Fury. Everyone (I hope) gets the difference between Frost and Fire mages. Arms is supposed to be about weapons and martial training and feel “soldierly.” Fury is supposed to be about screaming barbarians in woad. You get a sense of that, but it could be stronger. With the death knight, we allowed all three trees to more or less be able to tank. There is a desire among some players and designers to see Arms tank with a two-hander while Prot tanks with a shield. We’re still not sure that’s the direction we’ll go -- it’s a lot of re-design and will never work for say the druid or paladin classes.<br />
<br />
Q. What is it that makes them unique compared to all other classes?<br />
<br />
A. The big ones are stances and rage. Other than warriors, only bear druids use the rage mechanic, and that is pretty much just because that form is intended to mimic warriors. Rage is an unusual resource because it is infinite over the course of minutes, but can be very limiting over the course of seconds. While the basic mechanic of rage is interesting, it has caused us lots of balance problems over the course of World of Warcraft -- sometimes in the favour of the warrior and sometimes not. It’s probably time to give the mechanic another look.<br />
<br />
Stances are intended to be a major battlefield decision for warriors, though we realise it doesn’t always pan out this way. You have access to different abilities in different stances, but pay a rage cost as well as sacrificing the potential to use other abilities. More on this below.<br />
<br />
Warriors also have some unusual mechanics like say their ability to move quickly around a battlefield, to survive massive physical damage through plate armor and Defensive Stance, and game-changing abilities like Spell Reflect.<br />
<br />
Community Team: Warriors have quite a few abilities that are contingent on certain circumstances like Overpower and Intervene.<br />
<br />
Q. What is the reasoning behind this and do we have any plans to change that type of gameplay?<br />
<br />
A. We like situational abilities. When specs don’t have situational abilities, it’s easy to fall into a very fixed rotation. We call this the metronome. Push button 1, 2, 3 on your keyboard over and over until the bad guy drops loot. We have made more of an effort in all the classes to have certain moments that require players to pay attention a little more and then reward them when they both cause those situations to happen and then execute on them.<br />
<br />
Q. What would be the impact of changing those class mechanics?<br />
<br />
A. I think if anything, abilities like this need to be more prominent. You should be less effective at your job if you ignore them, and ideally you’d also be less effective if you just macro’d them in. We like macros (obviously, or we wouldn’t have them in the game), but we like for them to simplify chains of things that you have to do often without making decisions in between point A and B. We don’t like it when playing your class becomes how clever your macro can be to the point at which you are pushing one button to play your class. That’s not playing an RPG -- that’s programming a robot.<br />
<br />
Community Team: Stances have long been a debated aspect of warriors’ gameplay from the pluses and minuses each one offers to the restrictions they apply on what abilities are available for use.<br />
<br />
Q. What is the overall purpose of stances and how are stances intended to be used?<br />
<br />
A. The purpose of stances is for warriors to have to make decisions in combat. How badly do I want to Intercept now? Should I pay the cost of Spell Reflect? Ideally, we want warriors to switch stances in combat -- not every few seconds, but a few times over the course of a battle. Now we realise it’s going to be harder to enforce this in raid fights unless you have a battle with a lot of movement or other unusual circumstances.<br />
<br />
We get a fair number of suggestions from players trying to basically slip the stance concept out of the warrior class: make it not take rage, or let them do more abilities per stance so they don’t need to switch stances so often. That’s not really what the warrior is all about though. You should care what stance you’re in and it should be a decision to change stance. Note that if you pay too high a price to change stances, that counts as there not being a decision though.<br />
<br />
Q. Has there been any thought on moving away from restricting abilities based on the stance a player is in?<br />
<br />
A. No. The design intent of warrior stances is that you change your toolbar when you go from one stance to another and that that decision isn’t a trivial one. Now, the third part aside from the rage cost and ability limitations is the penalties (such as 5% damage taken in Berserker). We cut those in half recently, and we’d eventually like to get rid of them altogether. We just don’t want to see Arms warriors in PvP in Defensive Stance 100% of the time. We have seen DKs stick with Frost Presence in PvP despite losing 15% damage, so I don’t think you can just argue “Oh, no warrior would EVER do that.”<br />
<br />
Community Team: There has recently been a growing number of concerns with warrior damage, as a whole.<br />
<br />
Q. What are our thoughts on the overall damage for warriors in each of the three specs?<br />
<br />
A. Warrior damage was too high in Naxxramas and then a little low early in Ulduar. We think it’s in a pretty good place now and warriors will get a small damage buff in 3.2. Part of the concern here is we used to exempt warriors from the design philosophy that pure dps classes should do more damage than hybrid dps classes. We try to no longer play favourites here. Warrior damage should look like that of Feral druids, Enhancement shamans, Retribution paladins, and death knights. If their damage isn’t at that level, then it’s possible our numbers need some tweaking. However don’t always assume that you can’t possibly improve your gear or your button mashing either. Also remember that some fights just favour one class or spec over another. We’re totally cool with that, so long as it isn’t always the same exact class or spec that gets to shine. <br />
<br />
Community Team: Warrior shouts have added some unique utility to the class in the past, but now they tend to be used very sparingly.<br />
<br />
Q. What is the reasoning behind their short duration and do we have plans to improve the duration similar to the buffs other classes already provide?<br />
<br />
A. The shouts are supposed to be buttons that warriors push in combat. They aren’t intended to be pre-fight buffs like Arcane Intellect or Prayer of Fortitude. We had a discussion about this recently and decided with glyphs and talents that the duration isn’t a problem. If you lack Booming Voice and the minor Battle Shout glyph, it might be more annoying.<br />
<br />
Q. Demoralizing Shout tends to have a very minimal impact in most situations, are there plans to improve this ability?<br />
<br />
A. I think by “most situations” you must mean “PvP.” Demo Shout has a massive benefit against raid bosses. It’s probably 20% less damage from a typical boss and literally like 50% against say Thorim’s Unbalancing Strike. However, removing 400 attack power from a Feral druid with 9000 attack power, or a Shadow priest who doesn’t care about attack power at all is of much more limited use. Monsters and players use pretty different combat formulae (which is one of the weird things about the old design of say Vindication). We would like Demo Shout to be more useful in PvP, at least against characters who rely on attack power.<br />
<br />
Community Team: The rage mechanic as a whole is very unique, but sometimes leads to situations where players aren’t able to perform due to lack of resources. A prime example of this is when a tanking warrior’s gear is much higher than the content they are at, by taking less damage they get less rage which results in less threat and therefore cannot perform at a higher level.<br />
<br />
Q. Are there any considerations in store for improving this mechanic and allowing more rage generation in these situations?<br />
<br />
A. Yes. In 3.2 we changed Shield Specialization to provide a little rage on a dodge, parry, or block. This will help in say the 5-player dungeons or in the first few seconds of a raid boss fight. It does not solve the problem of the Prot warrior who is not being targeted (because they are there to pick up adds later in the fight or something). We want to solve that problem by letting Prot warriors generate more rage through doing damage. It could be in the future that we shift most of rage generation to damage done and have little or none in damage taken (and we would have to change a lot of other mechanics to make this work obviously).<br />
<br />
Now, long-term we need a better solution to rage generation. Tying it to damage done is logical in the theoretical world of game design, but has problems in reality. When your gear sucks, you have rage problems. When you have great gear, you are no longer limited by rage. That’s just not a great model, and one of the reasons warriors are overly gear dependent.<br />
<br />
Q. Where do we feel warriors fit into the current raid environment and where do we see them progressing in the future?<br />
<br />
A. Obviously warriors were the traditional tanks and pretty much the only tank in much of World of Warcraft’s history. Warriors now share tanking responsibilities with three other classes, which can feel psychologically like a diminishment in role. In Ulduar, we think warrior tank balance is about where it should be -- death knights were a little ahead, paladins were a little behind, and druids were about even with warriors. We are making a few Prot changes to 3.2 to help in some of the areas where they fall short, such as damage done. Death knights are getting an adjustment, paladins are getting a buff, and druids might get anadjustment or stay as-is. There are plenty of guilds progressing through hard modes with warrior MTs on almost every fight, and we don’t see that changing in the Crusader’s Coliseum.<br />
We’re happy with warrior dps in Ulduar. Whether you go Fury or Arms probably depends on whether you need Trauma or Rampage, and we know warriors in good guilds who flip between both specs. There is some evidence that Fury may overtake Arms dps once you get really good weapons. Dual-wield yet again shows its propensity to scale very well. Warriors will get a slight dps buff through Armored to the Teeth.<br />
<br />
Community Team: Sticking with raiding content for a moment. Many tanking Warriors have felt the there is little value in both Strength and Block Value attributes.<br />
<br />
Q. We have expressed an interest in improving Block Value for tanking warriors in the past; do we have any definite plans to update this?<br />
<br />
A. Shield Block Value just isn’t a strong mitigation stat these days. However, the amount it would need to be increased is enormous in order to make a difference vs. bosses that can hit for 40K. The problem with improving shield Block Value by so much is that Prot warriors would be nigh invulnerable -- they literally might take no damage -- against large groups of adds, in easier content where opponents don’t hit that hard, and in PvP. The real problem is that the amount blocked doesn’t scale with the amount of the swing. We think block needs to be a percentage of damage blocked in order for the stat to do what we want. But the trade-off would mean that warriors (and paladins) couldn’t block every incoming hit, especially from large groups. Avoidance might also need to come down across the board, and many talents and abilities would need to be redesigned. This is a major change that isn’t the kind of thing we can crowbar into 3.2 with a clean conscience. It is almost certainly the future for the block stat.<br />
<br />
Q. With strength on tanking gear currently providing a very minimal benefit and still using up a lot of stats on items, do we have plans to improve how this stat works for tanks?<br />
<br />
A. Strength is good for dps and threat. It’s not a super mitigation stat (through block) but we also don’t know that it needs to be. We have made some big improvements to Prot warrior dps in Lich King, but too many players still view the primary role of the tank to stack avoidance and mitigation and then complain when their threat is low because they avoided all dps stats. Now, we do think the game of survival is more fun than the game of the threat management, but we also need to get players out of the mindset that it’s okay for tanks to ignore dps stats and just do trivial damage. They don’t need to top the charts, but their damage should be a meaningful component of damage done. We’re willing to change the way the game works to accomplish this goal.<br />
<br />
Community Team: Let’s jump over to the topic of player-versus-player interaction. Discussions on the survivability of warriors in PvP have been ongoing.<br />
<br />
Q. Do we have any plans to make warriors less reliant on healers in PvP conflicts?<br />
<br />
A. We have taken small steps with Enraged Regeneration and increasing the healing on Bloodthirst. We don’t want the warrior to be great at healing as say a Shadow priest or death knight. On the other hand, we want healing to be a major part of the PvP experience. We’re okay with the occasional all-dps Arena team, but they need to be rare or a major chunk of the game just gets marginalised.<br />
Not related to PvP, we do think warriors have too much downtime when levelling. Healing may not be the solution to that, but we think it needs a solution.<br />
<br />
Q. With strength being the stat that provides the most benefit in dps scenarios, do we have plans to implement PvP gear like cloaks and rings that have strength instead of attack power?<br />
<br />
A. Doing that just means the item isn’t of any interest to say leather or mail wearers, which means we have to create twice as many kinds of rings. The problem is that some classes value Strength and some value Attack Power. Things would work better if some valued Strength and some valued Agility, and Attack Power was a useful secondary stat to both. This has the added benefit of solving the whole problem where leather and mail look attractive to warriors. If leather had Agility on it and plate had Strength on it, then it’s pretty clear who is getting what item. Strength for rogues and Agility for warriors wouldn’t be junk stats, but they wouldn’t be as attractive as the other stat. Again, this is a big change. We wouldn’t just gut rogue dps by stripping Attack Power off all of their gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GC was right on in the numerous threads where he said unless the class Q&amp;A's are filled with &quot;We're giving you buffs, we're giving you buffs!&quot;, people will think it's garbage.<br />
<br />
There were a couple issues that weren't specifically addressed, such as heroic strike spam, but (pay attention here) it's not like they've never talked about those topics before. Even without mention of heroic strike spam, GC has already acknowledged that it's a problem. Sure it would've been better to get an idea of what specific solution they're coming up with, but blizz might not have decided on or tested a solution yet.<br />
<br />
As a tank, I can say that my primary issues are low dps, threat generation typically not equitable to other tanks (particularly aoe threat), rage gen when not tanking, and the lack of incentive to stack block. Almost every one of these topics (sans aoe threat) was touched on. And if you're a prot warr who cries about threat gen and you don't have expertise soft capped, vigilance glyphed (or worse, specced), and respectable hit rating, then neither blizz, nor myself, nor any other tank worth their salt is going to have any sympathy for you.<br />
<br />
On the dps side of things, I would've enjoyed some discussion on the only talent in the game that purposely and directly *decreases* dmg (Titans Grip), but once again, they've already talked that topic to death. Like others, I do certainly disagree with blizz's assertion that warrior dps is in line with DKs and feral.<br />
<br />
The Q&amp;A really wasn't that bad. It could've been better, I'm sure even GC would say the same, but it still managed to address the majority of the class's pressing issues.</div></div><hr />

&quot;A. Obviously warriors were the traditional tanks and pretty much the only tank in much of World of Warcraft’s history. Warriors now share tanking responsibilities with three other classes, which can feel psychologically like a diminishment in role. In Ulduar, we think warrior tank balance is about where it should be -- death knights were a little ahead, paladins were a little behind&quot; <br />
<br />
Is that a joke?</div></div><hr />

Every DPS chart you see from a High-End End-Game guild the Deathknight is always WAY above everyone else.<br />

When specs don’t have situational abilities, it’s easy to fall into a very fixed rotation. We call this the metronome. Push button 1, 2, 3 on your keyboard over and over until the bad guy drops loot. We have made more of an effort in all the classes to have certain moments that require players to pay attention a little more and then reward them when they both cause those situations to happen and then execute on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe Elemental Shaman, Rogues, Feral Druids, Boomkins, etc all deserve a second look then? And let's not forget about warriors' heroic strike spam...<br />
<br />
<br />
GC also claims that part of the problem prot warriors are having with DPS is that they're stacking mitigation instead of offensive stats. As a part time healer I can say that I want my tanks to stack mitigation--survivability is the number one priority for a tank (followed closely by threat). So while I agree that, sure, stacking offensive stats WOULD up prot warriors' dps, I also add that it's a stupid idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
RE: GC's complaint about strength on pvp gear, etc--what the heck is going on with the dev team? I mean, really. They design the classes and how they benefit from stats. They design the gear. Why are they complaining about the sheer number of items they have to make to cater to specific classes/builds as a result? Don't even get me started on how much of a waste caster plate is right now. The obvious solution is to give more badge/honor/token/whatever options on vendors, but for some reason the dev team doesn't like that and views it as a &quot;last resort.&quot; They apparently feel victimized by their own design and get insulted when players are disappointed by the stats on the gear because they fail to cater to certain builds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To start: I am a warlock. My Q&amp;A was alright, and about what I expected. This is a long post, because I'm bored with warriors whining about how bad things are. Eventually you'll accept that you're hybrids and deal with that like everyone else has to.<br />
<br />
Q&amp;A, what they are not:<br />
-&quot;Yes, we'll buff this&quot; response to gotcha questions.<br />
-&quot;You're right, that fundamental part of your class's kit -is- both neat and obnoxious. We'll remove it and leave the neat behind.&quot;<br />
-Copy and paste of previous blue posts which you should read if you actually care about your class<br />
<br />
Q&amp;A, what they are:<br />
-Discussion about the philosophical ideas, the development, the design behind each class. (You know, answers to the ever-popular &quot;Fine then Blizz, what do -you- see our class as?!&quot; forum questions)<br />
-General descriptions of where the classes are going and how the dev team sees them<br />
-Answers to a wide variety of threads/forums, from around the world<br />
<br />
Mostly going to focus on debunking the DPS myths here. Tanks seem to be an exceptionally weird crowd lately and every one of them thinks they're the worst class for it, so I see no point in even trying to make a point there.<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;we see warriors as being in line with hybrid dps&quot;, a couple thoughts:<br />
1) DKs&amp;Ferals are not the entire list of hybrids. Somebody has to be last on the list, maybe it's you right now. Fun? No. Fair? Likely.<br />
2) Ferals are getting nerfed in 3.2, though not as dramatically as you might want. Blizz is possibly over-estimating the difficulty of the rotation, in justifying damage. We'll see.<br />
3) DKs' dps has some situationally goofy abilities, like wandering plague. Of course their goddamned Yogg dps is high. Unholy blight is getting changed from AOE to ST, so unholy DKs' ability to exploit those situations is going down.<br />
4) Elsewise, yes, DK dps could be high. Honestly, the skilled DK and warrior players I group with don't seem to put out dramatically different numbers. You can argue the DKs I know are bad. I can argue the warriors you know are bad.<br />
<br />
While we're at it, let's take a look at some of this &quot;omg DKs r op omg&quot; crap:<br />
First, WMO's damage to boss charts:<br />
http://www.wowmeteronline.com/rank/clazz/dtb/all/7/0/3<br />
Ok, no DKs or Wars on Algalon, Yogg, Vezax, VezaxH.<br />
-Freya: DK, 11th. Warrior, 14th, Warrior 16th, DK, 20th.<br />
-FreyaH: warrior, 3rd, DK 4th (and almost 9% behind), then another DK down at 18th<br />
-Thorim: warrior 6th, no DKs<br />
-ThorimH: DK 6th, 16th, warrior 20th. All pretty solid.<br />
-Hodir: Frost DK 13th, lolFS.<br />
-MimiH: warrior 2nd, DK 4th, <br />
-Kolo: warriors 1,2,5, and 18. One DK, 14th<br />
-Couple DKs low on IC hard<br />
-Ignis: war 2nd, DK 4th, war 6th, war 11th, 15th, 17th, DK 19th<br />
-XT: DK 7th, war 18th<br />
-XT hard: war 3rd, DK 6th<br />
Ok, that's an interesting picture<br />
<br />
Now, all DPS:<br />
http://www.wowmeteronline.com/rank/clazz/dps/all/7/0/3<br />
-Algalon: war 4th, 6th, DK 7th, 17th<br />
-Yogg, DK 2nd, warriors 6th and 8th<br />
-Freya, couple DKs here (YayOE)<br />
-FreyaH, couple DKs here (YayOE)<br />
-Thorim, DK 1st, warrior third, but generally DK dominated<br />
-ThorimH: warriors 4th, 6th, no DKs<br />
-Mimi: Warriors very strong here, couple DK<br />
-MimiH: Wars 1st/3rd, DK 4th<br />
-Auriaya: lolfight, most of the records from before the add numbers got reduced, DKs 1st/2nd :P<br />
-Kolo, DKs pull ahead dpsin' those arms!<br />
-IC hard: hey some DKs, no wars<br />
-Ignis: DK 2nd, war 4th, DK 11th, war 12th, war 19th<br />
<br />
Do you get the point yet? I could probably spell it out more clearly, but some of you need practice reading anyways.<br />
I'm fairly comfortable saying that DK and warrior damage is generally equitable. DKs, like rogues, abuse some AOE situations right now, and that is being addressed in 3.2 a bit.<br />
<br />
Cats, would take a separate analysis but they are definitely strong. And getting nerfed. Hmm.<br />
<br />
If you don't get anything out of Q&amp;As, don't read them. They're discussing design. They are not discussing the problems you have getting respect from your guild.<br />
<br />
Yes, this is basically a long &quot;l2p and shut up&quot; post. :) Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />

Btw they have been very candid with all these class interviews and its interesting to see their perspective on block. Before I thought &quot;only some of the time&quot; meant the way it is now, a % chance to block. However I do believe that to make boss tanking fair, making block absorb a percentage of a mob hit &quot;a maximum of 1 time per second&quot; could work excellently.<br />
<br />
Btw I can see why they want tanks to do more damage. Very few are interested in tanking because it is such hard work without the satisfaction of coming out on top of the charts.</div></div><hr />

Especially in terms of the warrior class, but i do not see a lot of it. The warrior class from jump starts out at a disadvantage, that grows as they go from lvl 1 to lvl 80. They are the only class with frankly no real def against magic, and by game design do not cast magic. A proper balance should be if a particular class or race cannot cast magic then they need to have a high resistance to it. Warrior should not have to wait to get T8 gear to get an occasional resistance to magic attacks, it really should be a baseline talent. If not then we will forever be victims of crushing blows from magic based attack, making healers jobs even more difficult.<br />
Not QQing at all just stating facts:<br />
- Warriors should be able to do mass amounts of damage if they can get you in melee, range to balance out the mass amounts of damage range casters can do from a distance.<br />
-Warriors need a way better form of magic resistance and it should not be attached to gear, buffed by it maybe but not as a only means of getting some (every other tank class has a baseline talent or passive ability for it)<br />
-I love the challenge being a warrior poses for me, i just wish the challenge was to be more efficient and better, then to just try to play catch up with the other racial tanks in the game.<br />
<br />
And one other side note, why does blizz design gear in naxx that arguably is better then its tier versions, makes no sense tier gear should be better hands down across the board set bonus or not. If not it really is not being thought out properly.</div></div><hr />

Well, whether they silence me or not, my point remains here. I just don't see why GC and the developers get so uppity about itemization when it's easy to fix and they have complete control over it. It's been an issue in every Q&amp;A and the reponse is always the same--complaining about how many items they had to make already, and re-stating that they don't like vendors for loot because it &quot;isn't fun,&quot; nevermind items like Librams, Totems, etc, that only drop off bossmobs and invariably never drop when you have somebody in the raid that needs them. You don't even want to know how much caster plate I've seen DE'd...and that armor is specifically catered to one spec of one class only, because of poor design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The purpose of the Q&amp;A wasn't to buff the warrior class. If that were the case then yeah, the whining would be justified. But it wasn't, and thus it isn't. The purpose of the Q&amp;A was to communicate and address issues players ask about.<br />
<br />
Replies like &quot;whaaa omg tey think warr dps is on par with feral teh Q&amp;A is the worst oen of all classes!&quot; are so incredibly stupid I almost feel embarrassed for the people that post it.<br />
<br />
The Q&amp;A did exactly what it was supposed to do. Did it address every single issue ever brought up about warriors? No. If it did, it would be 37 pages long. But of all the issues and concerns currently affecting warriors, the majority were discussed. Just because you don't like the answers doesn't mean the Q&amp;A failed. I'm going to repeat that:<br />
<br />
Just because you don't like the answers doesn't mean the Q&amp;A failed.<br />
<br />
For every one legitimate issue that they didn't cover, there were two or three that they did cover. Stance penalties, rage generation, rage itself, prot dps, comparison to other dps, comparison to other tanks, block, gear dependency, pvp, talent tree revamp, shout duration, pvp demo shout... ALL of it was covered. Seriously, other than perhaps HS spam and aoe threat, what glaring problems did they neglect to cover? I don't doubt there might be a couple others, but not many, and certainly not as many as they did cover.</div></div><hr />

Point taken, but in nearly every example (this comes back to, adressing it, even if you don't like it) they acknowledged the problem and said either they have absolutly no intention of fixing it, or it is too hard fix, or it is fine as is. No REAL changes are planned. At the end of the day, we are out dated and clunky, the devs know this, they just said it. Its not a big deal, just go re-roll there is plenty good classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stop QQing that your hybrid class isn't on top of the damage meter every fight, and look at what was actually written. He said SHOULD look like ALL THE OTHER MELEE HYBRIDS. As in that is their GOAL.<br />
<br />
He did not say &quot;Warrior damage is inline with Ferals and DKs&quot;. In point of fact everyone knows it's not. And if you bother to read the upcoming patch notes, you will see that DK and Feral DPS is getting nerfed. So Blizz is at least attempting to bring hybrid damage in line, and BELOW pure dps classes. <br />
<br />
Those of you that keep insisting that GC claimed Warriors were doing the same amount of dps as DKs and Ferals are so obsessed with your own E-Peens that you can't see that the designers are attempting the balance the game. If all you want is to be the top of damage meter then yes, RE-ROLL. You are playing the wrong class for that, and Blizzard has made it EXTREMELY clear that they will not be allowing warriors to do the same damage as rogues. Those days are over, and were a mistake to begin with. And DKs and Ferals aren't going to be allowed to face roll the meter any more either so stop crying like little kids who think Mom and Dad love your siblings more than they love you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabeathell</div><div class="date">2009-07-16, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">here's my personal take on the Q&amp;A. <br />
<br />
<br />
but too many players still view the primary role of the tank to stack avoidance and mitigation and then complain when their threat is low because they avoided all dps stats.<br />
ummm huh? of course its a tanks job to stack mitigation... you can increase your threat via talents (eg deep wounds) and by rotation, but suggesting tanks gem for dps stats is kinda silly and to me seems counter productive (especially if you are working on hard modes)<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors now share tanking responsibilities with three other classes<br />
I've been noticing that due to class abilities and cooldowns, we are favoring druids, pallies and DK tanks over warrior tanks... <br />
it just seems like the other tanks are better suited to the harder fights and our warriors are less favored due to no fault of their own.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior damage should look like that of Feral druids, Enhancement shamans, Retribution paladins, and death knights. <br />
notice the emphasis on the word &quot;should&quot; ... pity this is not the case.<br />
as a fury dps warrior, I realize that I'm gear dependent, but it is kinda irritating to see classes like DK's doing insane dps without requiring a set of BiS items. On a side note, the general consensus from some good kitty dps players I know is that the feral nerf will only cost them approximately 300dps... time will tell, but this doesn't seem like much of a nerf to me =P<br />
<br />
<br />
The purpose of stances is for warriors to have to make decisions in combat.<br />
this seems odd to me..... *if* i need to switch to defensive stance, equip a shield, taunt a boss and shield wall during a raid, then its safe to say that things have gone pear shaped and its probably a wipe. <br />
<br />
Stance dancing may be viable in PVP but in PVE it seems counter productive to me. in a raid, the ONLY time I find myself switching stances is when I'm switching from dps to prot *before* a fight..... I haven't seen the need to stance dance in PVE during a fight yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
In Molten Core and for raids afterward, warriors were THE tank, no question.<br />
I have heard this statement about warriors alot... but I started playing wow towards the end of BC, so all of this &quot;Warriors were so OP&quot; seems totally redundant. It just seems like current warriors are paying a penalty for what happened years ago.<br />
<br />
..... well, that's just a few randoms thoughts about the Q&amp;A .... although I feel they cherry picked the questions, I appreciate blizz doing these sessions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you would have took the time to actually look at the parses rather than just who got the top dps on each fight you would have noticed that in almost every case the warriors doing so much dmg had cleave at 50% of their dmg or more. <br />
<br />
I mean do you honestly believe that because a warrior can spec 3 points into imp cleave and glyph for it and do good dmg on a few gimmicky fights that warrior dmg is ok.<br />
<br />
Sure, theres a few examples where warriors are doing decent dmg without having to aoe down a bunch of adds to get there, but those warriors are geared as hell. Nine for example has pretty much full BIS gear including double dark blade. <br />
<br />
Warrior dmg is an issue with scaling, it always has been and unless blizz actually fizes the way it scales we will always be getting dicked around. <br />
<br />
I for one am tired of having to change specs, learn a new rotation, or completely change my playstyle with every patch, just to see warriors become less and less valued in raids. Now with 3.2 pallys will be getting a &quot;demo shout&quot; and if your raid has a combat rogue and feral driud then theres no need for an arms warrior. <br />
<br />
If the scaling issues with fury arent fixed, any guild that cant farm every hard mode to get their fury warrior bis gear will most likely just bring a rogue.<br />
<br />
Really, if the answer to the way warriors scale is -10% to all dmg, what happens with the next tier of gear and our scaling is out of hand again. &quot;We feel warriors ae doing too much dmg, Titans grip will now reduce all dmg done by 20%&quot;?<br />
Theres something to look forward to every time theres new content. <br />
<br />
This may seem like mindless QQ to you, but it is not. Simply someone who has played a warrior for years as well as a hunter, paladin, rogue, and a priest. I love my warrior and thats why its been my main for so long, but if blizz cant take the time to just fix the scaling problems with our class then I really see no point in playing it any longer.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garyuu</div><div class="date">2009-07-16, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I'm glad that they are &quot;going&quot; to fix warrior problems. Hey guys...we have hope!<br />
<br />
In all honesty, warriors are a broken class. Now to every other poster that reads this and says I'm a QQing noob...shut the hell up. I know how to play my warrior. Dps and tank. The system in which we do both is broken. Nothing in the Q&amp;A addressed this. Sure they said they are looking at future changes and looking on improving other abilities and talents, but thats not really fixing the problem now is it. Rage generation needs to be redone, as well as stances. If Blizz wants warriors to switch stances in the middle of a raid fight...what exactly is that accomplishing? A loss of all but 25 rage so we have to wait for the next hit to do anything? Sounds great to me!<br />
<br />
Dps as a warrior needs to be buffed....A LITTLE. I know Im a hybrid class but doing almost the least damage is pathetic. I know that DKs and Kitty dps is getting nerfed in 3.2, and warriors are getting a better Armed to the Teeth, but does Blizz really think that doing so will equal out warrior dps compared to DKs and Ferals? Being to gear dependent needs to be tweaked a little as well. <br />
<br />
Oh, and I also love how the PVP section was TWO FRECKING QUESTIONS LONG. <br />
<br />
Great way to basically just say we don't care. <br />
<br />
LOVE YOU TO BLIZZ!!! XOXOXOXOXOXOXO</div></div><hr />

Haha thats for overall while you were running it, it counts trash where his dps is &quot;high&quot; because of whirlwind aoe and because trash doesnt last long meaning a higher uptime percentage of trinket procs. (Because your trinket internal cooldowns still tick inbetween trash pulls) Presence doesn't matter, it doesn't list him in all the fights doesn't affect his dps AT ALL. DPS=damage per second. Meaning his damage done divided by the amount of time he was in there (in seconds) not dps divided by total time the damage meter was running. Theres a reason why highest dps doesn't necessarily mean highest damage done, for example, he's ranked 6th on damage DONE, but 1st on &quot;dps&quot; for overall data.. If you notice, he only did 3700 on your first vezax attempt and 4000 on your vezax kill. That is pretty low dps. He topped meters on freya with 5400, but if you look, his damage was padded by dpsing freya pre phase 2 with 730k damage done to the boss. (and if you didn't know, freya only has about 4 million hp and doesn't heal for much at all once phase 2 starts and there's wound poison on the boss. Nice try.</div></div><hr />

Bad Example. That Death Knight was probably Unholy and went to town with AoE. Or even Frost. I'm sure a Warrior would have similar results if it just AoE'd the Immortal Guardians.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure regardless of what happens, Warriors will survive. You're not broken now, and you're not wildly lower than anyone else. Given the state of WoW, you're more than likely not going to lose your raid spot because of your class. It'll probably be your lack of skills.</div></div><hr />

Retarded some of the ideas Blizz has. <br />
<br />
<br />
If you wanted a &quot;Real DPS class&quot;, why didn't you roll Rogue in the first place? I'm fairly certain it's obvious, if you did a little pre-play research, or even if you played the class to 20 and looked at the talents, that Warriors are a hybrid Tanking/DPSing class.<br />

<br />
The scaling issue is ridiculous, you have to have 4 pieces of T8.5 to come close to other classes in dps. I am almost all BIS gear and can pull 4-6k on most fights but it wasnt until i was geared out that i was even in the top 8 dps in my guild.<br />
<br />
Fury in raid content is 3 buttons while spamming a 4th, not fun, and in order to even keep enough rage to play for maximum dps you have to have a enhance shaman in your group. <br />
<br />
Warriors will still be broken in 3.2, we can just pray they will be fixed sometime this decade.<br />

i think the problem with warriors is utility. being the only class to lose half your dps when focused, where as a rogue just pops evasive cooldowns isnt really fair to warriors. no class should lose half their dps at anytime.<br />
<br />
blizzard will never give warriors that. they want to keep us reliant on others, and babysat with good healers. enough is enough.<br />
<br />
i played warrior for 4 years. got gladiator in all the seasons and i can honestly say, im tired of it all. warrior class wont change to the way the community wants it. blizzard has its own wacko ideas and they ignore the community on most occasions and come up with their own lame stuff each patch.<br />
<br />
if you want to play and have fun in pvp, just reroll another class. you can call me whatever you want, but this i know is true: your class will never change to the way you want it as a community. trust me, i been reading the bullshit blizzard changes since day1. they never had it right back then (they used to make us overpowered as fuck) and apparently, 4 years later, they still dont know how to get it right. so ya.. gg community feedback.<br />

<br />
GC was right on in the numerous threads where he said unless the class Q&amp;A's are filled with &quot;We're giving you buffs, we're giving you buffs!&quot;, people will think it's garbage.<br />
<br />
There were a couple issues that weren't specifically addressed, such as heroic strike spam, but (pay attention here) it's not like they've never talked about those topics before. Even without mention of heroic strike spam, GC has already acknowledged that it's a problem. Sure it would've been better to get an idea of what specific solution they're coming up with, but blizz might not have decided on or tested a solution yet.<br />
<br />
As a tank, I can say that my primary issues are low dps, threat generation typically not equitable to other tanks (particularly aoe threat), rage gen when not tanking, and the lack of incentive to stack block. Almost every one of these topics (sans aoe threat) was touched on. And if you're a prot warr who cries about threat gen and you don't have expertise soft capped, vigilance glyphed (or worse, specced), and respectable hit rating, then neither blizz, nor myself, nor any other tank worth their salt is going to have any sympathy for you.<br />
<br />
On the dps side of things, I would've enjoyed some discussion on the only talent in the game that purposely and directly *decreases* dmg (Titans Grip), but once again, they've already talked that topic to death. Like others, I do certainly disagree with blizz's assertion that warrior dps is in line with DKs and feral.<br />
<br />
The Q&amp;A really wasn't that bad. It could've been better, I'm sure even GC would say the same, but it still managed to address the majority of the class's pressing issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To start: I am a warlock. My Q&amp;A was alright, and about what I expected. This is a long post, because I'm bored with warriors whining about how bad things are. Eventually you'll accept that you're hybrids and deal with that like everyone else has to.<br />
<br />
Q&amp;A, what they are not:<br />
-&quot;Yes, we'll buff this&quot; response to gotcha questions.<br />
-&quot;You're right, that fundamental part of your class's kit -is- both neat and obnoxious. We'll remove it and leave the neat behind.&quot;<br />
-Copy and paste of previous blue posts which you should read if you actually care about your class<br />
<br />
Q&amp;A, what they are:<br />
-Discussion about the philosophical ideas, the development, the design behind each class. (You know, answers to the ever-popular &quot;Fine then Blizz, what do -you- see our class as?!&quot; forum questions)<br />
-General descriptions of where the classes are going and how the dev team sees them<br />
-Answers to a wide variety of threads/forums, from around the world<br />
<br />
Mostly going to focus on debunking the DPS myths here. Tanks seem to be an exceptionally weird crowd lately and every one of them thinks they're the worst class for it, so I see no point in even trying to make a point there.<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;we see warriors as being in line with hybrid dps&quot;, a couple thoughts:<br />
1) DKs&amp;Ferals are not the entire list of hybrids. Somebody has to be last on the list, maybe it's you right now. Fun? No. Fair? Likely.<br />
2) Ferals are getting nerfed in 3.2, though not as dramatically as you might want. Blizz is possibly over-estimating the difficulty of the rotation, in justifying damage. We'll see.<br />
3) DKs' dps has some situationally goofy abilities, like wandering plague. Of course their goddamned Yogg dps is high. Unholy blight is getting changed from AOE to ST, so unholy DKs' ability to exploit those situations is going down.<br />
4) Elsewise, yes, DK dps could be high. Honestly, the skilled DK and warrior players I group with don't seem to put out dramatically different numbers. You can argue the DKs I know are bad. I can argue the warriors you know are bad.<br />
<br />
While we're at it, let's take a look at some of this &quot;omg DKs r op omg&quot; crap:<br />
First, WMO's damage to boss charts:<br />
http://www.wowmeteronline.com/rank/clazz/dtb/all/7/0/3<br />
Ok, no DKs or Wars on Algalon, Yogg, Vezax, VezaxH.<br />
-Freya: DK, 11th. Warrior, 14th, Warrior 16th, DK, 20th.<br />
-FreyaH: warrior, 3rd, DK 4th (and almost 9% behind), then another DK down at 18th<br />
-Thorim: warrior 6th, no DKs<br />
-ThorimH: DK 6th, 16th, warrior 20th. All pretty solid.<br />
-Hodir: Frost DK 13th, lolFS.<br />
-MimiH: warrior 2nd, DK 4th, <br />
-Kolo: warriors 1,2,5, and 18. One DK, 14th<br />
-Couple DKs low on IC hard<br />
-Ignis: war 2nd, DK 4th, war 6th, war 11th, 15th, 17th, DK 19th<br />
-XT: DK 7th, war 18th<br />
-XT hard: war 3rd, DK 6th<br />
Ok, that's an interesting picture<br />
<br />
Now, all DPS:<br />
http://www.wowmeteronline.com/rank/clazz/dps/all/7/0/3<br />
-Algalon: war 4th, 6th, DK 7th, 17th<br />
-Yogg, DK 2nd, warriors 6th and 8th<br />
-Freya, couple DKs here (YayOE)<br />
-FreyaH, couple DKs here (YayOE)<br />
-Thorim, DK 1st, warrior third, but generally DK dominated<br />
-ThorimH: warriors 4th, 6th, no DKs<br />
-Mimi: Warriors very strong here, couple DK<br />
-MimiH: Wars 1st/3rd, DK 4th<br />
-Auriaya: lolfight, most of the records from before the add numbers got reduced, DKs 1st/2nd :P<br />
-Kolo, DKs pull ahead dpsin' those arms!<br />
-IC hard: hey some DKs, no wars<br />
-Ignis: DK 2nd, war 4th, DK 11th, war 12th, war 19th<br />

Do you get the point yet? I could probably spell it out more clearly, but some of you need practice reading anyways.<br />
I'm fairly comfortable saying that DK and warrior damage is generally equitable. DKs, like rogues, abuse some AOE situations right now, and that is being addressed in 3.2 a bit.<br />
<br />
Cats, would take a separate analysis but they are definitely strong. And getting nerfed. Hmm.<br />
<br />
If you don't get anything out of Q&amp;As, don't read them. They're discussing design. They are not discussing the problems you have getting respect from your guild.<br />
<br />
Yes, this is basically a long &quot;l2p and shut up&quot; post. :) Have a nice day.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, last I checked warlocks weren't a hybrid class, so what do you know about &quot;everyone else?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Second of all, you are looking at an extremely small spectrum of values for your comparisons. 0.001%? There's something called 'scaling with gear' and 'gear dependency'. Hybrid warrior dps scales differently (especially arms) than DKs. As a matter of fact, I would like to see a dps graph of warrior/dk/ret pally/feral druid that go from ilvl 180-250. <br />
<br />
This brings me to the actual Q&amp;A, which for the most part was a completely useless re-iteration and admission of some of the already existing problems, and of course no solutions, no plans, no promises. A few maybes here and there, the ideas blizz has and why they are bad (WTF?). Why did I waste my time reading this.<br />
<br />
Oh and please freaking distinguish between levels of hybridism. Paladins and druids are a lot more hybrid than dks/warriors.<br />
<br />
Hybridism:<br />
1. Warrior (least hybrid. 1 tank spec, 2 dps specs).<br />
2. DK (3 tank specs, 3 dps specs)<br />
3. Paladin (1 melee dps spec, 1 healing spec, 1 tanking spec)<br />
4. Druid (most hybrid. 1 melee dps spec, 1 tanking spec, 1 healing spec, 1 caster dps spec)<br />
<br />
In my opinion, paladins and druids should ALWAYS be WORSE than any other class in the same gear/skill because of having the advantage of the most hybrid classes.<br />

A hybrid in my opinion is someone who can perform multiple roles with a single spec. Example would be a druid moonkin that can heal in bad situation or a feral druid that can tank if the other tanks die. Pallies can spot heal in any spec. Warriors well warriors can only do what they spec for. We can't pick up a boss and survive if the other tanks die we get one hit way to quickly. We just don't have the dmg mitigation of other classes. So to say that warriors are a &quot;hybrid&quot; imo is a farce. We dps as arms fury or tank as prot. Can't do the other if you aren't specced for it while druids and pallies can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see no problem in having aggro on multiple targets,you have thunderclap,shockwave,demo shout,comon you must be stupid not to keep aggro with at least those only.And if there will be one mob running away from you,there is nothing more fun then to charge that mob,or intervene that person targeted by mob,and voíla,aggro is back.Also remind your group to stick to killing order.<br />
<br />
What do you want blizz to do?<br />
a) putting battle shout 1 hour duration? ( dont be lazy,hit that button every 2-3 minutes)<br />
b) making you a special aggro button,just push it and all mobs during that encounter will aggro you 100% ? you would like that i know,but where the fun in that?<br />
c) rage,you have a lot of that? spam heroic strike,you dont have rage? dont spam heroic strike.Just learn how,when to use your abilities and you will have rage all the time.<br />
<br />
I am not the best warrior in the world,but at least i am not complaining about it.<br />
Warriors ftw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't wait for hunter Q&amp;A; that'll be filled with more bullcrap attempts at trying to sweep a class' problems under the rug. We're currently the worst in PvP at the moment, and now that lock n' load is getting nerfed, even WORSE. OOOH WE GET THREE TRAPS THOUGHHHH! One crappy snake trap and a fire trap, when traps get resisted half the damn time.<br />
<br />
Enough of the hunter QQ though.<br />
<br />
I also have a prot warrior, and now I wish I had rolled a prot paladin. Our threat is terrible in comparison to the other tanks, and fury is laughable. Funny how they didn't talk about fury, despite the numerous posts about it....lol. Even arms, which they consider to be in &quot;good&quot; shape, doesn't do as much damage as rogues/hunters/every other DPS class.</div></div><hr />
