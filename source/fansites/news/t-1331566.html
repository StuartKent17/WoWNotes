Diablo 3's next expansion is named &quot;Reaper of Souls&quot;?<br />
Well we can definitely say the past few hours have been interesting. After uncovering the trademarking of The Dark Below (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3339-Blizzard-Trademarks-The-Dark-Below-WoW-or-D3-Expansion) yesterday, it looks like the teaser for the next Diablo 3 expansion just went live. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/august/thumb/d3x_teaser-en-us.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/august/d3x_teaser-en-us.jpg)<br />
<br />
According to the official website (http://us.battle.net/d3/en/reaper-of-souls/) &quot;Reaper of Souls&quot; is a trademark and linked to Diablo 3, with Gamescom coming up next week it wouldn't be surprising to see the expansion for Diablo 3 announced there.<br />
<br />
More importantly, it rules out The Dark Below as the next Diablo 3 expansion and makes things a lot more interesting suddenly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Our game sold 12 million worldwide on PC alone within roughly a year and we changed lead developers after all the crap the community gave him. Also we're launching on 3-4 more platforms within about a years time. So things are looking up but we're not gonna pursue this to 2.0 retail. &quot;<br />
<br />
That'd go over like a lead balloon with stockholders. We're likely to see 2 expansions for D3 maybe more. Depends on how well it continues to do. You might hate it but the numbers don't' lie. This game makes moneys.</div></div><hr />

Why not?<br />
<br />
There's a lot of questions left totally unanswered from the main storyline<br />
<br />
1) Where's the Black Soulstone?<br />
2) What of Adria? Where'd she go after turning Leah into The Prime Evil?<br />
3) Is it possible Leah's soul is inside the Black Soulstone, and that perhaps she kept The Prime Evil's power &quot;restrained&quot;<br />
4) If #3 is correct, could we rescue her soul?<br />
5) If #3 is correct, how powerful would The Prime Evil truly be?</div></div><hr />

Because of what Diablo 3 was.<br />
<br />
I logged on last week after ages. Got on my DH, looked at the AH, I had 4Million Gold and items were going for 2 BILLION gold...<br />

So yeah. All I want from the D3 expansion is to know the story. That's it</div></div><hr />

You have 2K11 in your name, any comment you make about one of the best game franchises ever made is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Diablo can only get better with an expansion, look at D2 pre-LoD it was, lets face it... shit. After LoD the game really started to shine, the exact same thing will happen for a diablo 3 expansion.</div></div><hr />

There are exactly two references in all of Warcraft lore (1 canon and 1 non-canon) to &quot;The Dark Below&quot;.<br />
<br />

Ra-Den, Ozumat, both in-game, RPG book (non-canon) and Stormrage (canon).<br />
Ozumat having the title &lt;Fiend of the Dark Below&gt; and Ra-Den mentioning it indirectly but quite obvious should be enough. There's nothing other than &quot;Diablo falling from heaven&quot; in D3 that could be related to it, but since The Dark Below was mentioned/referenced multiple times in Warcraft that's completely off the board. Blizz pulls weird stunts, but this would be stupidity at it's finest if The Dark Below was D3 related.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, I'm sure they'll find something to keep the game going after that. Even if we finally cripple the Burning Legion, and take out N'zoth, it still doesn't answer the question of what is going to happen when real titans come back to see how we're doing instead of just leaving things to their keepers.<br />
<br />
<br />

I wish people would stop interpreting Ra-Den's dialogue so literally. It's a pretty cliche way of saying 'Bad crap is about to happen, be wary'. Even if the Burning Legion arrived tomorrow, his words would still hold true.</div></div><hr />

Indirect counts for nothing in this situation, unfortunately, which is why the count of two references is correct. Way too many synonyms to &quot;The Dark Below&quot; for anything indirect to count.</div></div><hr />

If indeed the next expansion IS Azshara/N'zoth themed...<br />
<br />
It would have been nice for us to take a freakin' brake from all the &quot;omgwtfbbq old gods!!!11!&quot; stuff in WoW that we've been dealing with for three expansions in a row. Get off of Azeroth for a bit, stretch our legs...<br />
<br />
If anything, it's just going to prolong Wrathion flustering about the Burning Legion, unless, all of a sudden, the burning legion just simply becomes &quot;not a threat&quot; for whatever reason when Wrathion chocked their incursion up to being this huge, looming disaster. <br />
<br />
I mean, it'd be like us killing Halion and dealing with the Twilight's hammer in WotLK as this major plot point... and then proceed to have us bum around on Pandaria for an expansion... and THEN have Deathwing up and destroy everything a couple years afterwards.</div></div><hr />

Give me 4 Million Gold and i will equip you so far, that you can easy farm on at least MP5 without any problems including the overbosses.

<br />
It just got real in here. I'm thinking Naga with an old god spin based on Ozumat's title and Wrathion's title.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I want to remind you about who twisted Nefarian (Deathwing) to the creature he became. Because he spent his time in the earth as Aspect of Earth, he heard 'voices.' He can believe that the old gods, who were sealed away in the &quot;deeps of the world&quot; by the Titans, are indeed the ones who twisted him into what he became. (Titans have gone on to other places but do send watchers to see if Azeroth needs revisiting or destroying. We may remember stopping one in Ulduar.)<br />
<br />
I, personally, could easily see a return of the old gods being attached to &quot;The Dark Below.&quot; But leave it to Blizzard to leave me pleasantly excited and surprised at Blizzcon! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Diablo 3 has come a long way since launch. it's a much more solid game now. now hopefully the expansion can come along and it's a good time revamp existing issues that can't quite be patched in, like ability for open field play instead of being confined to linear story play that prevents you from saying, doing all 3 key wardens in same game without actually playing through entirety of 3 acts.</div></div><hr />

He was once believed to be the angel of death. In the books, it's been revealed that when Malthael speaks, his voice instills a feeling of utter dread and death.<br />
<br />
This seems to clear the way for the 2nd Diablo 3 expansion to be about Inarius and Lilith, which would be a fitting conclusion as Blizzard has previously revealed that Diablo 3 is planned to close the story.<br />
<br />
If The Dark Below does refer to the next WoW expansion, then that would be contrary to speculation and the setup in the MoP story pointing to the next expansion being about Argus and the Burning Legion. It would seem to imply that The Dark Below will be the Azshara/N'zoth/Neptulon/South Seas expansion.</div></div><hr />

I am an avid lore guy and thus I also spend a lot of time on the diablo wiki reading up the whole lore and you are absolutely right. Malthael is now known as the &quot;Angel of Death&quot; and he does wield a Reaper scythe.

I am looking forward how the whole plot of D3 fits into this expansion, especially the whole Prime evil stuff.

A Death Knight or a similar class (Runemaster etc.) is strength-based as well and in terms of a holy warrior, we already have one called the Monk.<br />

Westmarch does have a big role but still why there? The combination of Crusader may make sense coupled with Westmarch but when uncoupled they don't really fit in.<br />

Why not thread the Dreadlands or Dry Steppes or Xiansai or Swampland as a rune-empowered dreadnaught seeking vengeance on those who wronged him/her?<br />

Why try to tie them down all together when there may be many masterminds in evil plots whose path cross aka more content and story to go with the game (as well as more expansions or even a Diablo 4)<br />
<br />
People who enthuse about RPGs like rather nonlinear games nowadays and tying the events of the first game to the latter this easly in such a way that the next guy is just the master of the previous and the puppet of the next, it gets frowned upon as being quality-lacking storytelling.</div></div><hr />

Westmarch does have a big role but still why there? The combination of Crusader may make sense coupled with Westmarch but when uncoupled they don't really fit in.<br />
<br />
Why Westmarch?<br />
<br />
In Act III, there's an easily miss-able little scene where a messenger from Westmarch is talking to Tyrael I believe, and says something to the effect of &quot;The King of Westmarch says he shall send no living man to face an imaginary foe.&quot; Seems pretty strange for that scene to be in there, doesn't it? It gets weirder, too.<br />
<br />
The kingdom was initially founded by the Sons of Rakkiss, defenders of the Light who purged Westmarch of the followers of the demon Astrogha and prevented it from being summoned to Sanctuary.<br />
<br />
The D2 Paladin's order, Knights of Westmarch, are the descendants of a splinter group of the Hand of Zakarum, which disagreed with the Hand's methods, and founded Westmarch as a safe haven. They also have turned their attention to the Prime Evils, instead of smiting non-believers.<br />
<br />
The Templar Order is from Westmarch, and are an ascetic order dedicated to the Light.<br />
<br />
So, we have a kingdom founded by orders dedicated to the Light, and home to at least two such orders now. Both of the founding orders also fully believe in demons and the threat they represent. It's the neighbor of Khanduras (where Diablo and parts of Diablo II and III took place), yet we have this scene with their King saying it's all imaginary? Something is rotten in Westmarch.<br />
<br />
Two of the three folllowers also give us leads to Westmarch at the end of their storylines. We promise Lyndon we'll pay off the debt he owes in Kingsport, a city in Westmarch, &quot;It is gold. We will go to Kingsport one day soon. Then you can pay your debts, and your brother will be free.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Kormac says he's going to &quot;return home* and plunge my spear into the ground before the Vault of the Order. I will meet their champions until they answer for their sins and their lies. I will have justice.&quot; <br />
*He lived in Westmarch and the Order is there.<br />
<br />
Kormac also discovers that the Templars were created to fend off an angel invasion using 'angelic weaponry fit for human hands.' Tyrael said that although his brethren did want to destroy their world, they no longer do. One of the devs in the behind the scenes DVD said 'At the End of Days, angels and demons will fight on the land of man, and Deckard Cain talks about how he fears the angel-demon war will soon engulf Sanctuary. and that the 'wrath of angels' cannot be quenched at the end of the Wrath animation.<br />
<br />
We know the Templars have tomes of prophecies (which that $*@! Archbishop Lazarus stole), so it's very possible that the invasion they were created to fight just might be coming soon. ;)</div></div><hr />

I was criticizing the degree of certainty not of a possibility.<br />
<br />
With its lore and content in place as well as a setting for perhaps a final war, Westmarch feels more like the content of the second expansion that they will wrap things up in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game itself essentially said we were heading there after everything was said and done, and almost everyone discussing the future storyline suspected we were going to Westmarch in the expansion with 'the degree of certainty.' (I cannot fathom why you'd want to wait to visit it in the second expansion when your character him/herself promised to go there after beating Diablo)<br />
<br />
The guy that posted the 'leak' could very well be trolling, since he posted it after it had already been revealed (most people instantly suspected the Reaper must be Malthael), Westmarch had already been all but confirmed by the game itself so claiming we will go there isn't a stretch, the Crusader class seems probable, and the paragon/item improvements have already been revealed by the devs as on their table. I myself had predicted a 'crusader' class for the first expansion, not because of Westmarch, but because a Strength-based class and a sword-and-shield warrior archetype is missing, and the Paladin was super popular and people will want something similar if not the Paladin itself.</div></div><hr />

Also legendaries and RWs were random too in D2. It's just that the game was badly undertuned for net based play.<br />
<br />
I think there's a good chance of RMAH being removed. Considering people at Blizzard up to and including Wilson and Morhaime have stated that it was bad for the game in the long term, removing it could be their way of starting to rebuild a lot of the credibility they seem to have lost in a lot of players' eyes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But here is the thing and my requirements for getting it.<br />
<br />
1. Must have a offline mod &quot;I can give this up if everything else is met&quot;<br />
2. Remove the shitty itemization and replace it with ether loot tablets or just all around better itemization.<br />
3. Let me play a Paladin or Necromancer or if it is not ether of those class's a new and really fun melee class. <br />
4. I know this is a ARPG but give me a bit more of a open world feel and not on rails like D3 was. This is 2013 not 2001 I want to feel like I am living in a world not in a box.<br />
5. Better Story telling. Ya I know diablo isn't the best for this but I enjoyed D2+LOD and to me D3 was a step back from that.<br />
6. if it cost more then 40$ and that is pushing it I will not be buying it even if all of my requirements are met.<br />
<br />
7. Anything else I can think of its 8:10am and I can't think of anything at this time. But personally this Expansion pack can not be one inch shy of perfect or I will not buy it. Blizzard has showed me with D3/Cata/Mop that I can't trust them and just go out and buy a game they make.<br />

The new area will be Westmarch, new class Crusader, Paragon system will be improved and as promised the item system will be revamped.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, that's one I can handle. We knew the next class was going to be melee, because ranged outnumber melee. We knew the next class would likely use strength, because Dex and Int were already used by two classes each.<br />
<br />
You put Strength, and Melee together, and take away the names of the classes it -couldn't- be (Templar &amp; Paladin) and it was strongly suggestive of a &quot;Crusader&quot; class. Not conclusive, but suggestion.<br />
<br />
Westmarch is in the diablo Lore, and has been hinted in game there is some kind of holy guild there.<br />
<br />
that's pretty much my guess too, but i dont see why it couldn't be a Paladin class ?</div></div><hr />

Same as with past expansion leaks. Blizz accidentally leaks Goblin and Worgen Halloween masks yet everyone keeps saying that it was just a joke and that Blizz would never ever add Goblins and Worgen as playable races. Same with the Pandaren masks.<br />

<br />
so thats pretty cool that now we will have an angel vs demon type war, which i guess was propheized from the start anyways, while we were busy thwarting diablo's plans, the real battle is just really going to start soon, far more awesome and epic than simply stopping diablo (for yet another time). <br />
<br />
I always thought that d3 how they could bring back diablo for a 3rd game how that really worked, i mean sure they can bring him back...but always felt like there had to be something more, you dont just bring back diablo and say ok guys thats it, thats the end and you beat him again, thanks for waiting 10 years, here's to another 10...something had to have been more and waiting for the moment, and i guess today we got our answer....yay!<br />
<br />
cuz really i didn't feel that when we killed diablo again that it was very epic, the buildup was hit and miss and it was only cool to aucutally finish it, but after that...it was like...is that it? now what?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This seems to clear the way for the 2nd Diablo 3 expansion to be about Inarius and Lilith, which would be a fitting conclusion as Blizzard has previously revealed that Diablo 3 is planned to close the story.<br />
<br />
If The Dark Below does refer to the next WoW expansion, then that would be contrary to speculation and the setup in the MoP story pointing to the next expansion being about Argus and the Burning Legion. It would seem to imply that The Dark Below will be the Azshara/N'zoth/Neptulon/South Seas expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
If they take this phrase of the RPG as canon, we can use this to imply the involvement of the Burning Legion, in the next expansion, the Burdens of Shaohao also implies this, explaining throught the point of view of the Pandarens The Sundering.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Dark Below is a place inhabited by demons, devils and infernal creatures, from where some sorcerers take their power directly and sometimes have a patron beast to foster their magic.&quot;<br />

<br />
Except that it's been mostly common knowledge for some time that the third and final expansion for Starcraft is to be titles &quot;Legacy of the Void.&quot;<br />
<br />
So between that and &quot;Reaper of Souls&quot; all but confirmed as D3's first expansion, there's not really much room left to speculate what &quot;The Dark Below&quot; could be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would have been nice for us to take a freakin' brake from all the &quot;omgwtfbbq old gods!!!11!&quot; stuff in WoW that we've been dealing with for three expansions in a row. Get off of Azeroth for a bit, stretch our legs...<br />
<br />
If anything, it's just going to prolong Wrathion flustering about the Burning Legion, unless, all of a sudden, the burning legion just simply becomes &quot;not a threat&quot; for whatever reason when Wrathion chocked their incursion up to being this huge, looming disaster. <br />
<br />
I mean, it'd be like us killing Halion and dealing with the Twilight's hammer in WotLK as this major plot point... and then proceed to have us bum around on Pandaria for an expansion... and THEN have Deathwing up and destroy everything a couple years afterwards.<br />
<br />
Wrathion's prediction is that the Legion invades, and I'm willing to bet that Dark Below would end with Azshara bringing her old boyfriend back for a visit.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
My personal speculations on &quot;Reaper of Souls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malthael will indeed be the primary antagonist as many have been speculating. <br />
-Having fallen prey to his own despair from his inability to fathom the Worldstone's destruction, Malthael has become completely detached from everything and everyone around him.<br />
-Malthael's detached observations of the latest events have led him to conclude that the Heavens and Hells will always be inextricably connected and, if evil cannot exist without good, then neither must continue to exist and deems the &quot;wisest&quot; choice would be to undo all of creation. <br />
-Malthael will come in possession of the Black Soulstone and use it to further his cause.<br />
-Imperius will initially side with Malthael under the belief that the latter's aims are solely to destroy the Nephalem &quot;aberration&quot; and the world of Sanctuary. He will ultimately be betrayed.<br />
-Ithereal will die at Malthael's hand. Quoting the Prophecy of the End of Days &quot;Death, at last, shall spread its wings over all-- as Fate lies shattered forever. Ithereal is the possessor of the Scroll of Fate and is the only one capable of deciphering and reading it. Malthael may likely see see the scroll as key to his objective of undoing creation and will bind Ithereal's essence to the Black Soulstone.<br />
-Malthael, empowered by a soulstone holding both demons and archangels, will officially transform himself into the Angel of Death in the most glorious CGI short seen to date.</div></div><hr />

Yes Daralii, but what if they start taking it again as canon.

Yes, D2 was not so awesome back in '99, it was worse than the actual D3, as some friends have told me, and they improved the game with the expansion LoD, they can do it again with the D3 expansion (I myself have loved the game, the story could be better of course, but they have maintained the spirit of the game, at least part of it).</div></div><hr />

Agreed. D2 was shit and nowhere as fun before LoD was release. I personally enjoy D3 and, while the game has made many improvements since belly-flopping into live play a little over a year ago, I can't still can't help but hope that Reaper of Souls will do for D3 what Lord of Destruction did for D2.</div></div><hr />

And maybe getting azjol quest hub that they regret not completing. When I fall down the hole in the heroic I look around and think man, what a waste. Maybe they'll throw in some emerald dream so we won't be underground the whole time. Outdoor zones to gives us some variety in the dream.</div></div><hr />

I will be cautiously excited for the Diablo 3 expansion. I got burned way, waaaay too much with Diablo 3 to just start trusting Blizzard again with their &quot;sound gameplay decisions&quot;. (snort) But in all seriousness, Lord of Destruction did improve the original game a ton (apart from the damned recipes and gem stones... yeah, sorry, I hate crafting made out shit) so this might be a really good thing. I for one, am hoping for an improvement in these areas:<br />
<br />
1. Story - make a Diablo story that stays true to the original material. They should get rid of boring ass, cliche type of narrative and obvious plot twists and simply stick with what made the previous games great - originality and simplicity over convoluted bullshit. Make us care about the world again and its characters. Don't introduce new ones that will play a minor roll no one will ever care about. <br />
<br />
2. Locations - for the love of God and all that's holy, we need a jungle! Bloody Kurast and Flyer Jungle! More diversity with darker theme, not something out of a coloring book. Something sinister and not so flashy. We know the engine can light shit up for us, so try the opposite effect - make everything dark and ominous again. Oh, and the ability to switch between Acts is really, and I do mean really missing at this point. MAKE IT HAPPEN.<br />
<br />
3. AH - removal. Make it optional but out of the game. Seriously, the shit is broken. The game will only benefit from it. Oh, and the excuse &quot;the game's built around it&quot; just doesn't, it doesn't work anymore (see console versions of Diablo 3). <br />
<br />
4. Better class / weapon optimizations - we need to see this happen. Seriously, I am sick and freaking tired of my WW barb, &lt;insert cookie cutter build mandatory for any class in D3 ever&gt; I want to be able to switch and experiment with new weapons, new types of items that drastically change my playstyle depending on their stats. Oh, and most importantly - BRING, BACK, THE DAMNED, ELEMENTAL DAMAGE! Seems in D3, frost, fire, poison, lightning or the other dmg boosts rarely affect anything! <br />
<br />
5. More varied monster types / more spells for them to cast - yeah, this is really a no-brainer. Challenge comes not from the monsters HP / Attack modifier but from the &quot;dance&quot; that is hit, use spell, dodge, switch, avoid missile... instead of just flail at the damned thing until it falls flat. Diablo 2 had more variety than this. Sheesh. <br />

That's about it I guess.</div></div><hr />

WTF?!?!?!<br />
They will fix whatever they think needs fixing in the expansion, just as they did in D2:LOD. And just as they did in SC1.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I think there's a good chance of RMAH being removed. Considering people at Blizzard up to and including Wilson and Morhaime have stated that it was bad for the game in the long term, removing it could be their way of starting to rebuild a lot of the credibility they seem to have lost in a lot of players' eyes.<br />
<br />
Sure, but it is the only thing bringing in a steady supply of revenue. And frankly, removing the RMAH won't solve anything, as you will have dozens of third party sites popping up instead. People will be scammed, etc... as usual.<br />
<br />
What I think they'll do is work more on the loot becoming more personal to obtain, so that you don't have to go to the RMAH.<br />
<br />

why make an expansion for one of the worst blizzard games ever made even diablo fans hate d3 so why make this<br />
<br />
Yeah, why make an expansion of a game that sold over 12M copies... Hmmmm I wonder.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
For me D3 was the biggest disappointment, ever, at least as far as gaming goes, but it can be 'fixed' - so I say give Blizzard another chance.<br />
<br />
Blizzard first release is ALWAYS a half-problem. D2 classic was shit and it took LOD and 10 patches to fix it. SC1 was average at best and it took Broodwar and 8 patches to get things right. WoW vanilla was a bugged imbalanced garbage and it took several (let's not argue about how many :p ) expansions to get things right. D3 is no exception.<br />

<br />
D3 already has much more stuff to watch after: desecrate, arcane rays, molten etc... D2 had nothing like that. The biggest &quot;problem&quot; was IM and the stuff casted by succubi, and it came nowhere near D3. Any given D3 boss is a lot more complex than D2 boss (see Belial vs Duriel for instance).<br />
<br />
Sure, if you overgear everything you can stand in stuff in D3, but the problem is the overgearing, not the mob mechanics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The story line is what is going to eventually link the world of Diablo with WoW... the two are already linked in way, because the demons in wow also appear in diablo. Plus people like story, it makes it more interesting. Without a story you're just running around killing shit, but I'm sorry I like having a reason why I'm running around killing shit. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now what I think this means is this...<br />
<br />
When Sanctuary was discovered by the Angiris Council, he was the first one to raise a voice against its existence. He regarded humans as abominations polluted by the presence of Demon blood in their veins. He tried his best to have the hidden world destroyed but was opposed by his counterpart Auriel, eventually resulting in a Council vote to decide Sanctuary's fate. The vote went against his favor when Tyrael shockingly voted for humanity, but Imperius still harbors a deep grudge against the &quot;demon-spawn&quot; humans. <br />
<br />
Imperius HATES the humans, and now that Malthael is gone, he now can try to get rid of the humans especially after what they did to The Heavens in the end of the game. I think that you'll end up saving Malthael, and Imperius will get shunned for trying to kill off the humans, and will become the Reaper of Souls or something else. I believe this because,<br />
<br />
&quot;...he himself can summon a sword of fire at will, as he did when Mephisto confronted the Council, and can also thrust back humans with the force of his will, as he did with Mendeln, as well as summon and forcibly render other Angels, such as Inarius, silent with a gesture. These descriptions are mentioned in the book The Veiled Prophet from The Sin War series.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: BTW if you have ever done Inferno on MP10, if you even try to flail at anything you'll fall flat on YOUR face and die... 'Nough said...</div></div><hr />

The new area will be Westmarch, new class Crusader, Paragon system will be improved and as promised the item system will be revamped.<br />
<br />
According to the diablo history wasnt he &quot;the Silent Angel&quot;?<br />
<br />
Otherwise i agree with the prediction. with tyreal becoming the new wisdom it makes sense.</div></div><hr />

I will be cautiously excited for the Diablo 3 expansion. I got burned way, waaaay too much with Diablo 3 to just start trusting Blizzard again with their &quot;sound gameplay decisions&quot;. (snort) But in all seriousness, Lord of Destruction did improve the original game a ton (apart from the damned recipes and gem stones... yeah, sorry, I hate crafting made out shit) so this might be a really good thing. I for one, am hoping for an improvement in these areas:<br />
<br />
1. Story - make a Diablo story that stays true to the original material. They should get rid of boring ass, cliche type of narrative and obvious plot twists and simply stick with what made the previous games great - originality and simplicity over convoluted bullshit. Make us care about the world again and its characters. Don't introduce new ones that will play a minor roll no one will ever care about. <br />
<br />
2. Locations - for the love of God and all that's holy, we need a jungle! Bloody Kurast and Flyer Jungle! More diversity with darker theme, not something out of a coloring book. Something sinister and not so flashy. We know the engine can light shit up for us, so try the opposite effect - make everything dark and ominous again. Oh, and the ability to switch between Acts is really, and I do mean really missing at this point. MAKE IT HAPPEN.<br />
<br />
3. AH - removal. Make it optional but out of the game. Seriously, the shit is broken. The game will only benefit from it. Oh, and the excuse &quot;the game's built around it&quot; just doesn't, it doesn't work anymore (see console versions of Diablo 3). <br />
<br />
4. Better class / weapon optimizations - we need to see this happen. Seriously, I am sick and freaking tired of my WW barb, &lt;insert cookie cutter build mandatory for any class in D3 ever&gt; I want to be able to switch and experiment with new weapons, new types of items that drastically change my playstyle depending on their stats. Oh, and most importantly - BRING, BACK, THE DAMNED, ELEMENTAL DAMAGE! Seems in D3, frost, fire, poison, lightning or the other dmg boosts rarely affect anything! <br />
<br />
5. More varied monster types / more spells for them to cast - yeah, this is really a no-brainer. Challenge comes not from the monsters HP / Attack modifier but from the &quot;dance&quot; that is hit, use spell, dodge, switch, avoid missile... instead of just flail at the damned thing until it falls flat. Diablo 2 had more variety than this. Sheesh. <br />
<br />
That's about it I guess.<br />
<br />
Ahaha that's hilarious... The Diablo story was never even close to original or great. It was always a cliché and over the top obvious, it's like the cartoon version of The Divine Comedy with a dash from Faust.</div></div><hr />
