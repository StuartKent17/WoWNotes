We certainly haven't been quiet about it. It is coming. And it is coming... soo... er... promptly. <br />

Patch 3.1 - Argent Tournament and Website Update<br />
Two new articles have been added to the site, the first one is a short summary of the Argent Tournament World Event (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=857) (rewards included!). The other one is just a list of all the dungeon maps (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=860) added to the game default interface. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Additionally, the Professions Additions / Reagents Changes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=856), Patch 3.1 Mounts (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=858), Companion pets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=859) and Val'anyr - Legendary Mace (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=855) articles have been added to the left menu. You can expect minor updates/fixes to most of the articles now that all the important stuff is here. (I think)<br />

Blue posts<br />
Balancing the game in a fishbowl<br />
I'm not sure I follow why you call that a fishbowl. Usually when I hear that term, it is in reference to something that takes place very publicly. If we balanced in a fishbowl, you might be able to see all of the changes as we made them and why we made them. Many players ask for more transparency in the process, which suggests the fishbowl comparison isn't widely shared... unless I misunderstood your metaphor.<br />
<br />
We don't balance around best in slot items, though my impression is the community cares much more about that. Most of our PvE balance is concerned about whether the group can beat the boss, and whether some members are contributing too much or not enough to that experience. Very, very few raids have all best in slot items (otherwise you kind of wonder why they are still raiding). We need to know the maximum theoretical dps (in this case), and how characters will scale with better gear, but we also need to know what classes will do with introductory levels of gear too.<br />
<br />
We do spend most of our balance effort at max level, because that is where it is most important to the community. Very few players are raiding below max level. We do spend some effort to make sure groups can complete their quests or the level up dungeons though. We do not spend a great deal of effort on the 1v1 &quot;I was ganked in the middle of Stranglethorn&quot; PvP situations, though we do consider it as part of the process.<br />
<br />
Hope that provides a little more transparency. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137619516-balance-in-a-fishbowl.html))<br />
<br />
Val'anyr and upcoming legendary items<br />
So Mages (and other non-healing casters) are in the queue. Not at the end, with Rogues for example. But not at the front, where the healers patiently stand.<br />
<br />
I cannot hint at future damage dealing caster legendaries. But I can empathise with your feelings, and I do. I'm hopeful your time will come... again. :-) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/8638334506-valanyr-hammer-of-the-ancient-kings.html))<br />

<br />
<br />
It would?<br />
Because there were priests and druids running around with them. Now you can argue that they are only 2 out of 4 healers.<br />
But then again, moonkins and shadowpriests (how unwanted they were at naxx 40 time) could get it as well.<br />
<br />
Atiesh should have never been removed from the game anyway. They didn't do that shit with HoR, TF and all others right?</div></div><hr />

Since when have mages and warlocks behind healers in the queue for a legendary? Unless I am wrong the caster legendary was atiesh, and now that thats gone there are 0 caster legendaries in the game, so why are healers at the front of the line for one? Dps casters haven't had more legendaries so that really makes no sense. It wouldn't have been hard to make the legendary have a dps caster benefit.<br />
<br />
That makes a lot of sense, since healers got ... what legendary since Atiesh? And only half the healers could even use that? Why design a dps caster benefit when only three dps casters can use it? <br />
<br />
Where were these QQs when warriors and rogues got two legendaries back to back?</div></div><hr />

Yes, you will be able to get all faction mounts.<br />

Damn right. This is the start of the most epic change to sweep WoW in years! The opening, phasing and gradual shifting and change of Old World content! Finally the ORIGINAL lore will be able to be experienced through the game, not just a novel.<br />

One hopes.</div></div><hr />

That might be due to the way they made the game... (meaning they made the lower lvl raiding instances obsolete with the insanely better gear so it lost reason to be used)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
On occasion they would close the PTR at the very last minute. Sometimes it's the evening before patch day, sometimes it's that very morning. Sometimes we wouldn't even know for sure until *during* the weekly maintenance, when a Blue would confirm it. (Unless of course it was rolling restarts that week.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to the OP, they spoke with a GM in game. As far as the legitimacy of this post, I don't know. <br />
<br />
What I do want to know is does the end of Season 5 signify the possible 3.1 patch to drop tomorrow? Or is this all just wacky forum rumors?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Interestingly, Gilneas withdrew their support from the Lordaeron Alliance after the Second War. They are hostile toward the Horde. I believe the main reason they built the Greymane wall was to keep out &quot;other people's troubles&quot;. They are one of the strongest human nations, and extremely isolationist.<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see what Blizzard has planned for them. :)</div></div><hr />
