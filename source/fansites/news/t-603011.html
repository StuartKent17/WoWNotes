Yesterday, I stated that all quests rewards have been increased from 75 to 250 reputations, I was wrong. Actually the longest quest, Rampaging Giants, has been increased to 350 reputation instead of 75, that's a 466% increase.

2.3 patch available on the Background Downloader<br />
This doesn't mean anything, remember that we had to wait weeks between the first download of the 2.2 patch and the release on live servers. <br />
It's the background downloader prepping for 2.3 much like we've done before. It just means we're getting closer.<br />

Utgarde Keep Preview<br />
A preview of the Utgarde Keep has been posted on the official site, nothing really new about the dungeon itself but there are a few interesting details and artworks.<br />
<br />
You can read the preview on the official site (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/features/dungeons/utgarde.xml?rhtml=y). <br />

Hunters<br />
Hunter shot rotation issues are fixed in the next 2.3 PTR update, spells in /cast and /castsequence will no longer toggle. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=879058320&amp;postId=27201197169&amp;sid=1#266))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Interface<br />
In 2.3 chat channels are rate limited on the client in the same way whispers are now. Each chat channel is limited separately, at a rate of 10 messages in 10 seconds. This means that you can send one message every second without ever seeing delays, or a burst of 10 messages every 10 seconds without seeing delays. Messages that exceed this rate are not dropped, but simply delayed in order until they can be sent. This does not affect SendAddonMessage() or party/raid/guild chat. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=879058320&amp;postId=27199790927&amp;sid=1#262))<br />

Items<br />
There is a possibility of adding more space to characters in the future, but there isn't any finalized decisions on this. (Source] (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2720553229&amp;postId=27200291779&amp;sid=1#19))<br />
It's just too early to say if [item=29434] will be used in Wrath of the Lich King.<br />

I don't really know what that means. Does it mean that we can't use steadyshot macro anymore or?</div></div><hr />

Even though it may be possibly be weeks, it's a small step nearer =3<br />
<br />
Though I hope it doesn't take that long (like 2.2 did)...<br />
<br />
Otherwise I'm hoping they're overthinking all the hunter changes again, especially if the amount of buffs the hunter received didn't overshoot the mark. I feel very uneasy about the disarming shot: In my opinion, ranged dmg dealers already got enough advantages over melee dds. :/<br />
<br />
Well, let's see what impact all this changes will have in pvp for melee classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
that is correct... very annoying thing when it was broken + the PTR latency made it a little horrible to dps as hunter on PTR.<br />
<br />
glad they fixed it.</div></div><hr />

Horde were supposed to get an equivalent to get a white raptor. You were supposed to get it from the troll npc Ravasaur Trainer in Un'goro. But blizzard gave up on the idea.... /sigh</div></div><hr />
