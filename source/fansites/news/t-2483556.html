Raid Testing Schedule - May 9th - 10th<br />
On Thursday, May 9th and Friday May 10th, we will be conducting out first raid tests of The Eternal Palace.<br />
<br />
Thursday, May 9th<br />
Abyssal Commander Sivara - Heroic Eternal Palace<br />
13:00 PDT (16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
Lady Ashvane - Heroic Eternal Palace<br />
14:00 PDT (17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
Friday, May 10th<br />
Orgozoa - Heroic Eternal Palace<br />
13:00 PDT (16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
Radiance of Azshara - Heroic Eternal Palace<br />
14:00 PDT (17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a test environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br />
A: In Zuldazar, Boralus, Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)<br />
<br />
Q: What character should I use to test the raid?<br />
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players’ effective level to 120 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounter(s) being tested.<br />
<br />
Q: How long does testing last?<br />
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we’re satisfied that we’ve received that information for a given boss, we’ll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.<br />

I mean, could they be mandatory in order to challenge specific raid encounters?<br />
<br />
I could imagine they are &quot;mandatory&quot; if you want every little bit of an edge in the World 1st race. And yea...this resistance / damage to aberrations thingy had me wondering and it could be helpful to anyone trying to crack a specific bossfight. Just like we eventually could beat MC without mindcontroling those guys and fire res buffing the raid or without Onyxia's / Nefarian's head up in Orgrimmar etc etc...but at the beginning it sure helped.<br />
<br />
Then again, there were examples where the guilds with lower average ilv won etc....<br />
<br />
No matter what, the guilds that seriously think they have a chance of competing will likely do ANYTHING that they consider as a benefit in the competition.</div></div><hr />

You know this is just a catch up system right? WF/TF score really well with the casuals and aren't going anywhere. I don't see anything that specifies that these items won't be able to WF/TF, just that what stats the items have is predetermined - Not the amount of stats / ilevel. Even if this gear can't forge because they want it to be a time sink the raid / dungeon / etc gear still will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where exactly did i say the WF&amp;TF are being removed???I just said they are a shitty sistems nothing else.And how did you made the conclusion that adding vendors is me saying WF/TF will be removed?<br />
<br />
My last sentence is even explayining how i like to have dropping items (aka WF/TF i did not think i have to spell it to any to understand) combined with buyable items is a great combination.</div></div><hr />

I didn't say you said any such thing. I was just letting you know that they're popular with the casuals and won't be going anywhere.</div></div><hr />

Why can't they just add gear as visible items to the vendor when there is still the option to filter items for your spec only? They did it in TBC already.

Probably a bit who knows, the one thing I have heard is that they are not littering the new zones with world quests, rather you get three quests each day to do and that is it.. Though I think the other way to get the new currency is by killing the rares..</div></div><hr />

Yeah, ofc I meant in order to achieve the world first ( don't really care about those who will achieve it after nerfs or better equipment ).<br />
It seems like the old good AQ, when instead of trying the bosses the players were forced to obtain NR gear.<br />

<br />
The stats are fixed. I assume they did tokens so that they did not have to put cloth mail leather plate on the vendor, it will be the armor type of the toon that uses it. I am curious, if the head shoulders chest are azerite items or just items with secondary stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably they won't be azerite items, also given the fact that head, shoulders and chest are the only 3 slots which doesn't give a new bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The accusation of timegating seems to be the newest thing and I always wonder if people had their memories erased or just didn't care &quot;in the good old days&quot;.<br />
<br />
FOURTY+ Onyxia cloaks to have a chance in BWL? Fire resistance in MC? Mag not being possible for mere mortals without enough hunters that got the tranq shot skill (forgot if it dropped from a boss before or how they got it). AQ with nat res gear? C'thun bugged. Rep gate or entry fee to enter Naxx. (&quot;Hey guys, you are only prepared to take out this evil that threatens to kill everything when we revere you or you pay 200 gold&quot;...or whatever it was back then. What a ridiculous timegate) Long ass attunement in BT including limited quest items dropping from Lady V and KT initially. Shadow res gear for Mother Shazz in BT. LITERALLY time gating by releasing portals to SWP only after a certain time. Arthas being pretty much unkillable before the zone buff arrived.<br />
<br />

But don't you know? It is anecdotal evidence or because of CRZ or because there is that one capital to go for each faction or because you lie or you are just a blind fanboi white night Bli$$ard love and even when the game had 8 or 10 or 12 million subs, it still was beyond redemption and dead...because &quot;cannot be saved&quot; means whatever the person who says it imagines it to be.<br />
<br />
Trust be...I have been here for over 10 years and read it all. The game is dead when subs rise and the game is dead when subs decline. https://alunariasavenue.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/29.jpg - the ironic thing is that the website didn't even survive WoW</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but do you get a preview of the item you are buying (for example a tooltip telling that the item will have Haste &amp; Mastery)? If not it's the same as it has always been with this kind of Token gear, RNG decides which combination of stats the item will have.</div></div><hr />

Well they seem to be more following a 90 day patch cycle this time. Each patch has been the closest tuesday to 90 days from the previous. (with launch to 8.1 being 4 months but that makes sense for a launch)<br />
<br />
Game launched on 8/14, 8.1 was 12/11, 8.1.5 was march 12. If they continue following that pattern 8.2 will be ~June 11th and 8.2.5 in mid-september.<br />
<br />
I'm seen some speculation on classic in mid july so that would actually work out best for blizzard to launch that between 8.2 and 8.2.5 anyway</div></div><hr />

I've played since the US Beta came out, and all I'm saying is I'm starting to see a pattern of increativity. The last 2-3 expansions have re-used this system of &quot;catching up&quot; because of lack of content, basically. I don't only want a vendor to be able to catch up, what about a new dungeon or two. The Crucible of Storms doesn't count here, because it has only 2 bosses and very limited and obscure types of loot.</div></div><hr />

Dude I know right and you can't forget the most egregious timegating, LEVELLING. They need to remove levels in all forms from the game, character levels and gear levels especially. I should be able to login on a new toon and be acceptable by any group to fight any boss. Also I can't believe they just brought back resistance gear with this new Benthic gear. Like do they not understand we the player base want instant dopamine rushes for no pay off? instead of paying to get nothing.</div></div><hr />

Interesting proposal..you should make a thread about it. I think we will get a lot of interesting replies.<br />
<br />
Saracasm translates a bit hard in written form (and me not knowing you...but I don't think you are serious)...but even with my first character taking 17 days /played to lv 60 in 2005, I then proceeded to spend 100 days AT lv 60. Current levelling character (DI dwarf) is at barely 60 hrs to lv 108. Pushing the 7th character from 110-120 and every level so far took max 2 hrs.<br />
<br />
So....I don't really see levelling as that bad...and let us not forget, it will stay because Blizzard gotta sell boosts (now it is your turn to find out if I am joking or not)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a genuine question. Why would they create tokens instead of flat items ?<br />
<br />
Cause for now it looks like yes, that the stats will be determined on the item. Benthic leggings of the whale : crit/mastery. Benthic leggings of the harmonious : versa/haste. Yet when you get use the token you don’t know if you gonna get whale/peerless leggings. Like how it’s been up to now, actually.<br />
<br />
But hey, if at least they have a reason to use tokens instead of items and that there is truly no RNG, it’s definitely an improvement from the system we have now.<br />

Answering to myself: looks like they use containers to only have one items for every type of armor but they completely got rid of the RNG when “crafting” the item from the token, ie cloth gloves have crit/haste. Nice.<br />

Actually yes there is right now so it's either because it's just been implemented or it's not predetermined.<br />
<br />
I just logged onto the PTR (was able to without a sub for some reason) and bought some Benthic Legs. They did not have predetermined stats on the vendor or when it went in my bag before I opened it, they did not offer me an option to choose stats and it rolled crit/vers only when I identified it.<br />

<br />
Pretty sure the stats are just determined by your role (class role, not rng roll).<br />
<br />
They're doing this so that they can just have one type of item that drops and works for all players regardless of class. These will probably become account bound at some point, like other catch up gear tokens they have added in this past, and this will simplify that so you don't have to get the right armor type for your chosen alt.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velerios</div><div class="date">2019-05-11, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So why are they selling tokens then and not items ?<br />
<br />
Because of two reasons:<br />
<br />
First reason: It's much less work. If they do sell it directly, they would need to put up to 324 DIFFERENT ITEMS to a vendor. It's probably not 324 different items, but even if it's only half or 1/3rd of it, it's still around 100 items to set up on the vendor. So instead of this, you have 9 different tokens. Seems far more reasonable.<br />
<br />
Second reason: It's to prepare to the future. Adding new classes requires them to also make the items from past expansions available to them. So instead of revisiting the armor-vendors and unlock every single armor to the new class, they need only to add the class to the tokens and having them able to get the loot.</div></div><hr />
