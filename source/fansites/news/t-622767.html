Garrosh Hellscream and Thrall are talking/go to duel in the arena in Orgrimmar. In the middle of their fight, they are interrupted by Scourge, at which point they kill the scourge. After which, you can hear a magnificent war drum sound, and the battles begin, Thrall starts voice-shouting his 'attack' sounds, and the battle is under way. It is also assisted w/ the well known Herald of the Lich King discussion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrosh Hellscreem says: Thrall... Warchief... your armies await your command. Let me lead them to Northrend to remove this undead menace!<br />
<br />
Lady Sylvanas Windrunnre says: Yes, Thrall. The time has come to kill Arthas. You can take my grand apothecary with you. His knowledge will be invaluable against whatever the Scourge will throw at you.<br />
<br />
Grand Apothecary Putress says: It would be an honor, Dark Lady.<br />
<br />
High Overlord Saurfang says: Warchief, it is clear that Northrend represents the gravest threat to our people, and that we must act against it. But this foe is unlike any other. caution must be advised.<br />
<br />
Thrall says: My soul burns for revenge, but the elements tell me to think clearly. The Lich King is a ruthless opponent... one who must be handled carefully.<br />
<br />
Thrall says: We will send scouts to assess the situation. I will also convene with the Lady Proudmoore and see what plans the Alliance has.<br />
<br />
Garrosh Hellscream says: Gragh! I cannot take this! While you talk and deliberate, our enemies grow stronger! Were it my choice, I would have put all our available forces onto that frozen rock and conquered it for the Horde!<br />
<br />
Thrall says: If this is a trap, it is one I will not blindly walk into! Do not make the same mistakes as your father, Farrosh!<br />
<br />
Garrosh Hellscream says: After all that he did for YOU and YOUR people? MAK'GORA!<br />
<br />
Thrall says: You challenge me, boy? I don't have time for this...<br />
<br />
Garrosh Hellscream says: So you refuse? Is the son of Durotan a coward?<br />
<br />
Thrall says: Inside!<br />
<br />
Garrosh Hellscream yells: Your duties as warchief can wait. For now... we fight!<br />
<br />
... they fight and Thrall loses.<br />
<br />
Thrall yells: GYAH!<br />
<br />
Garrosh Hellscream yells: Hah! So, son of Durotan, what--<br />
<br />
Herald of the Lich King yells: PUPS OF ORGRIMMAR! HEAR ME, BRASH UPSTARTS OF THE HORDE! TREMLE, AND KNOW YOUR DOOM, FOR THE LICH KING'S GAZE IS FIXED UPON YOU!<br />
<br />
High Overlord Saurfang yells: Warchief! Scourge forces are attacking Orgrimmar!<br />
<br />
Thrall yells: We will finish this another time... son of Grom.<br />
<br />
... fighting scourge !! Abominations and frost wyrms.<br />
<br />
Herald of the Lich King yells: ARGH! THIS SMALL VICTORY WILL AVAIL YOU NOTHING! COME! COME TO NORTHREND. MY MINIONS ARE WAITING, AND THEY ARE HUNGRY...<br />
<br />
Garrosh Hellscream says: Well, Warchief? What say you now? Will you send me to Northrend?<br />
<br />
Thrall says: Saurfang...<br />
<br />
High Overlord Saurfang says: Yes, Warchief?<br />
<br />
Thrall says: Marshal our forces. Contact our goblin shipwrights. The Horde prepares for war!<br />
<br />
High Overlord Saurfang says: As you command, Warchief!<br />
<br />
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner says: Excellent... most excellent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No 'direct' dealing maybe, but she wholeheartedly allowed the events of the Wrath Gate to occur. She spared that treacherous Dread Lord Varimathras and gave him the very thing he needed in order to cause more damage to everyone. A chance. Do I dare mention the new plague that the Forsaken have been working on for the past five years that's meant to not only wipe out the Scourge but EVERY LIVING THING on the face of Azeroth? This is what Sylvanas wants and this is what the Apothecary are delivering.<br />
<br />
Ya. Sylvanas is totally innocent to the events that will transpire. I mean, who's the more foolish? The fool. or the fool who spares a DREAD LORD and allows him to reign by Sylvanas' side?! /sigh.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty happy that King Wrynn finally stood up to Thrall and declared that we weren't going to put up with his dealings with the Forsaken. Even though Wrynn makes a mistake by attacking the Horde forces on the spot, he does it for the right reasons. <br />
<br />
My real fear is the possibility that Jaina might shed ties with the Alliance for the Horde's sake after what Wrynn does. If that happens, the Alliance might as well disband altogether.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, Sylvannas always knew about the forsakens plague.<br />
<br />
Like, virtually every apocothery quest started in UC, loads in Tarren Mill, Hinterlands, all refer to the &quot;refining of the plague&quot;. Getting it ready for when its released, testing it until its perfect.<br />

<br />
Sylvanas did not want a plague to kill 'everything', the plague she requested was to kill the scourge. It was Putress and Varimatharas who devised the plan to further increase the new plague's destruction, and staged the coup again her, nearly killing her.<br />
<br />
It is shown, through Sylvanas' protection of the blood elves, and of Quel'thalas, that she does not wish to destroy all life bar the forsaken.<br />

Last I checked, they barely scratched the surface of &quot;changing the whole world&quot; with the zombie plague. Which lead to nothing but incessant bitching for the brief time that it was around.<br />

I doubt he has 5.5mil HP in that duel. It was probably knocked down quite a bit seeing as having to wait for one person to drop someone 3.3mil HP would just be ridiculous (I really doubt they had 800k).

Yep, same here - the harbor is nearly void of players, just the dragons flying around for about 15 minutes... then Wrynn gets pissed and kills a bunch of undead, then all undead kind of die by themselves and it's back to the usual standing around under the tent until the undead come back.</div></div><hr />

Although the time that one guy managed to swear fealty to the big demon lord, and thanks to the Monarchy system the next time the programmers logged into the demon it gained like 40 levels was pretty damn funny. Also seeing said Demon Lord walking out of a Crafted item quest npc's shop wearing an Ursuin Skin hood going, &quot;lolz, I'm a Ursuin!&quot; was worth every penny I ever spent in that game. Just wish I'd been there the time he walked into a bar, sat down and said, &quot;Dude, Turbine totally nerfed Demon Lords in this months patch!&quot;<br />
<br />
Plus, they blew up a city REAL good when they did their weird floaty necropolis invasion. Doubt Blizzard can do it better.<br />
<br />
<br />
End of AC Beta was so fucking awesome. We wer elike 30 people in a little town called Uziz and defending versus the incoming monsters. The ground broke up benath us and lava was flowing... Each monthly pathc people gathered intel about the changed stuff. Following rumors around.<br />
<br />
The Zombie Event had that for a short time. When we sat there waiting a tnight what would happen next. I recall End of WoW Beta invading mobs aswell, sadly los tthe screenshots, but since then I haven't seen anything alike anymore.<br />
<br />
I mean they are advertising with siege weapons, destructible buildings, etc ... Would have been too awesome to defend the SW harbor in a steam tank while building would collapse (and be rebuild ofc) by the attack of arthas and his Minions. I sady doubt we will see anyhting like that outside wintergrasp and the new bg.<br />
<br />
AC was so much more fun ... each looted item could be so awesome and I was fortune enough to gather like 15-20 mattekar robes in winter. Gave them all away to my Allegiance. I loved the portal and sales bots that were a player driven community to get around the areas. It was all more mutual game than wow.<br />
Fear of loss of items/decay of stats after death, etc ... My friend still tells me stories of the defence od Kara, 48 hours with no sleep vastly outnumbered, but still successfull.<br />
<br />
Wow is just getting more casual. Professions don't matter anymore, no need for cc, consumables (weight stones, oils, only 1 potion, pets takign care their own way with happiness), etc etc.<br />
<br />
I have around 600 days played in wow (yep I have no life) and if WotLK wasn't jsut so amazing in scenery and quests I'd hardly have much motivation left.<br />
The challenges are removed from game and everyone gets his purples now.<br />
<br />
In times of MC ... 40 players 2 per week per item slot could get set items and it was common to run around in blues. Instances dropped nice blue boe items ... now it is like ... &quot;LFM Karazhan, t5+ full epic and xp required&quot; ... Naxxramas will drop BoE Epics, just like Onyxia drops her BoE Blues ... ZzzzzZ<br />
<br />
But well the majority of the players is hardly what you call hardcore (saw someone advertise in trade chat today:&quot;Hardcore guild with 4 raidng days a week looking fo rmore members&quot; lol) and those bring the money so I kind of understand that they want to appeal to this kind of customers.<br />
But they need to appeal the game to us hardcore gamers aswell. I had high hopes when they announced that even raiders will have a sense of accomplishment in wotlk. Too bad it turned out to be an achievement system and not something like I would have liked to see. Blizzard made WWS + Blizzard made wwscoreboard. That would be so freaking awesome.<br />
Instead of competing with the best shamans I have 2000 fishes to catch to get old Ironjaw ... real accomplishment!<br />

I consider myself casual, working fulltime and studying an MA part time, but I get slightly annoyed by Blizzard's catering to the casuals too. I guess it's hard for them to appease everyone but it seems nothing requires an effort anymore. Doesn't matter anymore who has and who hasn't a purple, it's more what kind of purple you have, which also removes the value of it.</div></div><hr />

We searched for a quest or something to do to take part in it, thinking it might have something cool and unique to this event but nothing.<br />
<br />
Then I said you know, if this was AC, they would have unique drops that would be cool. There would be a quest and an aura of mystique.<br />
<br />
We read that Varian said something about defending the boats but to no avail.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I have to agree with my Alliance comrades. It was fun and nifty, but overall lame. Relegated to a small area of Stormwind, 71 elites hitting for 100 points of damage. Epic Feeling? Not much after the initial 5 minutes.<br />

Um, because you get a good deal of backstory on humans, dwarves, Arthas, and even the gnomes. Whereas the Horde doesn't get much outside the Wrathgate storyline and the ambassador quests with the Taunka.</div></div><hr />

It was the 24/7-gamers who suddenly could not anymore hang around the cities spamming the trade channel and waiting for another Arena/BG-match to open or a PUG heroic group to find. Most of the casuals I know were rather disappointed that the event lasted such a short time and wasn't bigger.<br />

<br />
Or conversely that the content CAN be rushed in the first place, would you not say? I always thought you played a game for the challenge, but these days it seems all the kids just want to beat it. They just want to win the game, and that's all that counts.<br />
What good is winning the game, since the fun'll end then? Dumbing the game down just hurts everyone, casuals and hardcore both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
too bad the mobs dont put up a real fight (fighting for 'city blocks' would be cool) and the armor doesn give a specific buff (maybe something like AD trinket) to fight of these invaders... so you can collect tokens from kills to trade in for more AD stuff OR maybe even Argent Crusade rep.</div></div><hr />

Still it looks nice to see an attack like that but after doing it 2-3 times the fun is abit off.<br />
Also, the prologue event of TBC started 1 week (atleast could have been more) before the launch of TBC. this started like 2 days before the launch, which in my opinion is alittle late.</div></div><hr />

If you look at the combat cycle thrall missed a few of those lightning pawn strikes and if he would have hit them he´d crush Garrosh, I´m sure he´d catch up. Garrosh is NOT fit for leading the horde. I would rather se him as an enemy encounter than having him leading the horde. Saurfang is the only one besides Thrall i could se at this point as leading them.</div></div><hr />

haha... you worry too much, besides it is ment that thrall loses against garrosh according to the event. Garrosh is not fighting thrall for leadership but more for able to send the horde to northrend.</div></div><hr />

Worrying to much didn´t see the obvious. <br />
<br />
Your right ofcourse, he was fighting him for the right to lead horde armies to northrend rather than challenging him for leadership. <br />
<br />
But don´t hold it against me I´m just looking after my warchief ^^</div></div><hr />

With these &quot;forces&quot; out of Org, in Northrend, it leaves Org vulnerable to attack from the Scourge. <br />

Ya, and I guess she didn't want to kill every Alliance soldier who allied with her in retaking lordaeron.<br />
<br />
And as leader of the Forsaken, I would assume that she is responsible for all those that reside under her leadership. She allowed them to have access to what ever was needed for the new plague and from the looks of it she did a very poor job on keeping a close eye on their works. We are talking about a Dread Lord after all. Sylvanas is in no position to play innocence here. It's her plague, her people and her cause. Even if she did die in the coup, it wouldn't have been tragic, it would have been poetic justice.<br />
<br />
Heck, she's as much a danger to herself as she is to others! I can only hope that Thrall comes to understand that maybe the Alliance has a point in opposing those who ally with Sylvanas. She is a mass murderer hell bent on revenge and wants death to anything that opposes the Forsaken.</div></div><hr />

So do we get a new Forsaken leader, or expelled from the Horde ;) Would definately be a plot twist lol. Forsaken as a 3rd faction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What exactly is wrong with the logic of mass murdering, revenge and death to all enemies, foreign and domestic? Imho, nothing is wrong with this logic. Kill or be killed, die or die trying. She did in fact get very sloppy and lazy in the overseeing of this new plague but that still doesn't warrant recourse for any actions that are taken by her forces nor the forces of her enemies or allies.<br />
<br />
Probably in all due respect why the undead race is and always will be my favorite because of this logic. Sad in the actions that were taken against them but none the less hell bent on revenge on whomever or whatever they see fit.</div></div><hr />

Can you do that though? Varian isn't alone, Bolvar is standing next to him, as is Broll and Valeera. I think it'd be a hell of a fight, but maybe I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />

If you bring the right personnel (Sunwell tanks, decently geared hunters, and of course, healers, along with a good core of casters/melee to dps/deal with alliance) it's not that bad. You can pull Varian down to a point where the adds, once they respawn (which is fucking quick) they won't aggro on the raid. Bolvar is the only really annoying one with an area of effect hammer of justice. That combined with Varian's whirlwind (which stings) can reallly screw you over if you aren't careful.</div></div><hr />

I know Varian isn't the hardest leader (Thank you Bronzebeard) but I wasn't sure if adding Bolvar would make it a huge pain in the ass. That AOE Hammer, mixed with Heroic Leap and Whirlwind puts the odds of being screwed pretty high, I'd think. I don't know how strong Valeera and Broll are, I only saw them killing mobs, didn't check the hp/dps they have. I'm Alliance, but I was just curious if it could be done.</div></div><hr />

I haven't endured such a lagest since the AQ40 gates opening on our server though, yikes.</div></div><hr />
