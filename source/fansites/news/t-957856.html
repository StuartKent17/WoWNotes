<br />
Death Knight is the least leveled class because everyone leveled one to 80 during WotLK to be one of the cool kids. Including a fair amount of people who ended up not liking it. <br />
People didn't hit the &quot;Nothing left to do on my main character, better reroll!&quot; wall that they encountered in WotLK, raids were properly balanced and people didn't spend their first months steamrolling Naxxramas.<br />

<br />
That's the point ... They were so many in wrath because it was THE NEW CLASS OMG, but people went back to their old main for Cataclysm when they realized they don't like DK as much as they thought.<br />
<br />
Those are relative stats, there's still a lot of DKs, just not as much as the amount of DKs in WotLK.</div></div><hr />

No, I'm just working with chaud on news posts now, with the hope that he will act as a backup if I want to take 1 week of holidays at some point. I haven't had a week-end or holidays since I started the site in March 2007, and I'm running out of gnome jokes.<br />

It's not a &quot;most played&quot; poll -_-. It's a percentage of classes from 80 that went to 85. So Death knights could have been 3 million strong at 80 while mages were only at 1 million (this is an EXAMPLE not the actual situation). if 33% of the Death Knights went to 85 and 80% of the mages, there would still be more level 85 Death Knights (1 million DK's and 800k mages).</div></div><hr />

<br />
anyway im suprised dks are the lowest considering how many were in wrath<br />
<br />
I for one liked old frost tanking, and Blood DPS talent trees. I was considering making a DK my main (instead i quit the game) new DKs kind of sucked, Blood was awesome and self healing to be substantially noticeable like it was in WotLK for all classes that had it, especially for PvE.<br />
I hate a number of the class changes, leveling to 85 sucked.<br />
<br />
It was a long process it felt, quit boring (I did easy leveling enough already), instead of feeling like I was getting stronger I was getting weaker, feeling like crap, running out of many on every toon that used it, hard to solo more than 2 mobs, AoEing = waste of mana and time/space on bar, again all the breaks between mobs i had to take, dispel nerfs (affecting PvE too) self healing/siphoning total negligible crap for PvE 81-85.<br />
<br />
Everything just took longer to accomplish less, I am okay with that at max level, but not during the boring grinding stages of rep, quests, leveling and obtaining measly blues and greens.<br />
<br />
<br />
The content of this game is just stale, and having to wait for ever for my favorite role - DPS - totally sucked for endgame. I hate tank and spanks, I did some healing at 85, I hate it because I hate worrying about mana over keeping up on heals instead. Besides healing in this game is way too much of a passive role, its not active and it doesn't help in pushing fights, kind of the same with tanking (but I don't like being the one at the mercy of the healer) dealing negligible damage.<br />
<br />
So much stuff is going for Cata I JUST DON'T LIKE, class changes to the content (of dungeons and raids) was either changed in so many negative ways, or just too old and boring AI that beats a tank a whole fight and nothing else.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
One thing I talked about and entirely agreed upon. I was looking forward to &quot;having very difficult heroics&quot; comparable or harder than even normal raids. That is what they implied at the last Blizzcon. Instead there was no way to get gear in any fun manner at 85, dealing with a slow grind/farm of rep and regular dungeons, that were so easy they put me to sleep. Meanwhile I flat out wasn't geared enough to run heroics, skill was irrelevant numerically was impossible w/o gear.<br />
<br />
Gear scaling has hit the crap pile ever since TOC came out, before that time Gear scaling was at a much more appropriate scaling (TOC 12-19 points between the tier, Ulduar-6-8 points, nearly half).<br />
<br />
The roller coaster of mainly unneeded or desired class changes totally sucked along with the roller coaster of new balancing to fix the changes. <br />
<br />
I guess one thing I did get sick of on my own, may not my own but it was dealing damage or for the most part every role doing the same exact actions all the time, with binary results/responses to everything. Stand there and mash a rotation (idc if there are procs, to me it is still a boring simple rotation) I'd rather have content be less about dealing damage and more about staying alive, i'd rather it be very hard to stay alive but the DPS req isn't extremely high either. Some may say that is more difficult, but really? Just stand there and mash a couple hotkeys over and over, being the main challenge of raiding sound fun? The coordination is pretty much all preemptive (done before the fights) because the fights are very predictable and scripted, making it such a linear way to fight it.<br />
<br />
To me that gets boring after a while, maybe, just maybe, get some smarter AI in this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do you say they are talking about the death of WoW. Nobody is saying it is dying, that would be a freaking far stretch to to assume that is what they meant, because the death of WoW would have to be them having less than a million players which I think Blizzard will hold well over a couple millions subs fr the next many years.<br />
<br />
They may lose like 1-2 million through time/age and shooting their-selves in the foot, but likely will lose 5-6 million through the many big time hitter MMOs that will come out within a year from now.<br />
<br />
Even if they lost the highest of numbers from what I said, it would be 11-8million still leaving 3 million. 3 million is far from dead.<br />
<br />
WoW is losing popularity and/ its intrigue to its players, that is a fact. Since the game WAS so big and still is losing its popularity will likely not be something to happen quietly in the night as you may wish.<br />
<br />
Stop complaining about the topics others wish to discuss, you don't have to read them first off, let alone reply with a negative tone, implying people are bad for posting so.</div></div><hr />

People didn't hit the &quot;Nothing left to do on my main character, better reroll!&quot; wall that they encountered in WotLKGenerally, I think many people think there is less to do in endgame in Cata than there was in WotLK. While the raids were harder yes, a lot of people became left out due to the collpase of 25-man raiding, and the merging of 10-man and 25-man lookout, even amongs the ones who did get to raid. We know that Blizz got worried about the overall level of participation in raids in Cata (hence the super-nerf to T11 in 4.3 and marketing it under the slogan of &quot;PUGGABLE raids!&quot;.Surely there have been more incentives, not less, to say &quot;nothing to do, I should level a new alt&quot; in Cata.Furthermore, new races and new content and quests in Azeroth should encourage levelling.If anything, Cata should have been the &quot;levelling more alts&quot; expansion. If it isn't, something is seriously wrong.</div></div><hr />

Yes, in a watered down fashion from what Wrath introduced them as. From 3 to 1 tanking specs, and 3 to 2 dps specs is a downgrade. Inb4 the 'it was impossible to balance, its better this way' crowd - I will make no mention of which is better, as that IMO is more about perception and opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Death Knight is the least leveled class because everyone leveled one to 80 during WotLK to be one of the cool kids. Including a fair amount of people who ended up not liking it. <br />

My DK is only level 71....therefor your statement is flawed.</div></div><hr />

No, the UI makes it look like that but it will always tell you after you vote, that your vote has already been counted. So no people aren't inflating it by means of voting multiple times on the poll like that.<br />

Interesting. Even though it &quot;kinda&quot; says that mages are most played class (I'm one myself :P) I must say that my realm is filled with paladins... (and hunters and druids but they were # 2 and 3 anyway lol)<br />

Nothing left to do really and the PvP is so boring. Most of us left for games like WoT and TF2. As for myself i only come to mmo-champion to hopefully one day read about how they allow transfer of heirlooms across servers... I've always been a fan of leveling characters on new servers in WoW. I find it relaxing and quite enjoyable. WoW has by far the best leveling experience out of all mmo's out there.<br />
<br />
The problem i have with WoW is that when i quit i don't get this &quot;urge&quot; to come back and play. I don't even think about WoW when i leave it. There can go many, many months before i come back, usually an expansion brings me back just to see if anything has changed. I remember trying to quit daoc back in 2002-2004... that was so hard. I could barely make it past a couple of days before i was back. The PvP was just... awesome you really missed it. But yeah, that was back *then*. Things sadly change over time and it lost it's appeal quite a few years ago.</div></div><hr />

Oh. I'm sorry.<br />
I thought the site name was 'MMO Champion' -<br />
not 'WoW champion'.<br />

Given that it's Curse owned now you'd probably also better believe they will cover more than WoW if they can make more revenue by doing so (and they will be able to - especially taking into consideration that they now know that a rather surprising near 40% of their regular visitors don't even play WoW).</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're from Scrapes of the Armory. <br />
<br />
<br />
If there is any actual datamining, I'm sure there are many more categories people would find more interesting then the jump from 80-85 such as class totals and breakdowns by spec.<br />
<br />
WoW Popular does the spec stuff, Chaud did a breakdown of Gender (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/954914-Character-Gender-Ratios-Blue-Posts-Fan-Wallpaper-TCG-Artworks?p=12660709#post12660709) awhile back, Guildox (http://www.guildox.com/go/g.asp?a=11)has data on things like server ratios and level 85 populations per server, etc. If you don't find these numbers interesting, ther's plenty of places with other numbers. <br />
<br />
<br />
But I doubt these are real numbers because of the new site code...<br />
<br />
He compared data from WotLK where there was the old XML site code. And now developers with (or who work for) websites like this one can register with Blizz and get API access that will allow them much more than the 3000 requests per day limit so such data is much easier to obtain now than it was when you had to crawl through a million XML pages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the point ... They were so many in wrath because it was THE NEW CLASS OMG, but people went back to their old main for Cataclysm when they realized they don't like DK as much as they thought.<br />
<br />
Those are relative stats, there's still a lot of DKs, just not as much as the amount of DKs in WotLK.<br />
<br />
I actually think it's because they changed (to worse) the class so much that some people just don't like it anymore. Myself being DK throughout whole Wrath I switched mains after about 5 minutes of trying the new 'improved' DK in 3.0 because the gameplay wasn't fun anymore. And I think it's the case for many people.<br />

Indeed. Changing rune regeneration from concurrent to consecutive was and is moronic. Even worse was the removal of blood dps; and frost and unholy as tank specs. And Blizzard developers don't grasp why there were fewer tanks.<br />
<br />
I loved DW Frost tanking. /weep<br />
<br />
On a different matter: I take insult with Chaud's statement about &quot;people didn't spend their first months steamrolling Naxxramas.&quot; Naxxramas destroyed my first serious guild (10 man) I was in because the gear requirement was too big a difference from dungeon gear. Blizzard developers admitted as much (can't source since it was on the old WoW forum). H Naxx was the only way many many players on my server even got to experience half of it, let alone all. If it was a decent group, it took ~4hrs. A difficult PuG with lots of replacing and wipes was just shy of ~6hrs.<br />

The argument has been had too many times. &quot;mmo-champion&quot; is a name. You do not have to be called &quot;WoW-champion&quot; to cover only WoW.

It's amazing how fast the game becomes boring when you stop raiding. There aren't really any long-term goals you can go for, just like 1000 easy &quot;meh&quot; achievements.

Aside from the unsupported DK claim (I mean, &quot;all the cool kids&quot;, wtf? I don't think that's the reason anyone levelled a DK - to try out a new class, maybe - and people who didn't like it tended to ditch it in the lengthy 70 to 80 Northrend grind - most people didn't get on to 80 at all), what particularly sticks out to me as nonsense is &quot;people didn't run out of things to do on their main in Cataclysm&quot;, which is just utterly untrue. Whilst raids were much better balanced, I went from &quot;having useful stuff to do&quot; to &quot;only logging in to raid&quot; in Cataclysm in absolutely record time. It might have been under a month, and that would be play an average of 2-4 hrs/day.Reason I didn't re-roll isn't that I hadn't run out of things to do - I had. I didn't re-roll because Cataclysm's 80-85 levelling was vastly more tedious than 70-80, and I really didn't have anything to look forward to. I swear that a bunch of people re-rolled in WotLK so many times because it was FUN to do so. It's not so fun to do so in Cataclysm. There's a reason subs are down, and it sure isn't that Cataclysm is more enjoyable or fulfilling than WotLK (despite some parts - basically only raids - being better).</div></div><hr />

You make the assumption that the people who reroll are too crap to finish a heroic dungeon. If that's how we're looking at things, I bet you can't even finish Wailing Caverns.<br />

I'm not in the sort of guild that will ever clear HC Rag (certainly not until he's long-dead content). Nor are most people who play WoW or post/read here. It's funny you mention that, actually, because it was the sort of guild that could clear Ulduar HMs and TotC HC (and most of ICC HC), but the love just hasn't been there for Cataclysm. If we had ALL the best players come back, all at once, and stick around, yeah maybe that would be a thing, but Cata has made it so we only have a percentage of the people who loved WotLK stick around. Part of it is that the new raids - whilst much better designed than the old ones - were sufficiently challenging that we couldn't bring 1-2 &quot;kinda bad&quot; players and still do okay (unlike WotLK) - which actually drove away good players after their bad friends stopped raiding/playing.Plus, by your &quot;dailies and HMs&quot; logic, most of the people in WotLK who re-rolled did it early, too. The real reason people re-roll is that they're not making significant progress on their main, or not having fun on their main. Grinding dailies isn't fun for most, and smashing your face into HMs/HC isn't always fun either, unless you have an incredible team. @Ms Andry - Sure, but when you state it as a &quot;fact&quot; and put it with another couple of &quot;facts&quot; that's aren't true, it's kind of annoying :p</div></div><hr />

Well, they could give virtual tickets to non-US people instead. But every larger contest was US only in the past, even with stuff that is also available in the EU (like that Alienware PCs).

<br />
Beating your head against a wall until it turns into a pulp isn't something most people care to do.<br />
<br />
You *know* if you're in a guild that wants to and is capable of taking down HC content. You know if you have decent players, and if people are motivated enough to endure hundreds of wipes to learn a hard encounter. If not, then you're never going to beat all the HC content in a timely manner, if you beat it at all.<br />
<br />
If people were saying &quot;I'm so awesome, the game is too easy&quot; then your response would be relevant, but what they're actually saying is &quot;this content is aimed at a different demographic, there's nothing left for ME to do...&quot;<br />
<br />
By the way, this is a big problem for MMOs in general. As the entire market has converged towards the EQ/WoW &quot;theme park&quot; style of design, the long run/end game has devolved into &quot;do some battle grounds, do some dailies, do some raids.&quot; It's all structured content that's been seen and done a million times before already, so a lot of people are just tired of it. I know that I am, personally. I left WoW because after fully committing to the raid/quest/PvP grind for better gear in Wrath and TBC, I just had no more interest in having all my gear reset in Cata and doing it all over again. If this is all that WoW, or MMOs in general have to offer, then there's no much in it for us &quot;veteran&quot; MMO players.</div></div><hr />

I was considering making a DK my main (instead i quit the game) new DKs kind of sucked, Blood was awesome and self healing to be substantially noticeable like it was in WotLK for all classes that had it, especially for PvE.<br />
I hate a number of the class changes, leveling to 85 sucked.<br />
<br />
It was a long process it felt, quit boring (I did easy leveling enough already), instead of feeling like I was getting stronger I was getting weaker, feeling like crap, running out of many on every toon that used it, hard to solo more than 2 mobs, AoEing = waste of mana and time/space on bar, again all the breaks between mobs i had to take, dispel nerfs (affecting PvE too) self healing/siphoning total negligible crap for PvE 81-85.<br />
<br />
Everything just took longer to accomplish less, I am okay with that at max level, but not during the boring grinding stages of rep, quests, leveling and obtaining measly blues and greens.<br />
<br />
<br />
The content of this game is just stale, and having to wait for ever for my favorite role - DPS - totally sucked for endgame. I hate tank and spanks, I did some healing at 85, I hate it because I hate worrying about mana over keeping up on heals instead. Besides healing in this game is way too much of a passive role, its not active and it doesn't help in pushing fights, kind of the same with tanking (but I don't like being the one at the mercy of the healer) dealing negligible damage.<br />
<br />
So much stuff is going for Cata I JUST DON'T LIKE, class changes to the content (of dungeons and raids) was either changed in so many negative ways, or just too old and boring AI that beats a tank a whole fight and nothing else.<br />
<br />
Did you ever notice that you only leveled 5 levels instead of 10? So the mobs hit harder and the progress was slower since it was only FIVE levels? Did you really want progress of 5 levels like 5 of 10 from prior expansions? Bored faster? lol.<br />

Indeed. Changing rune regeneration from concurrent to consecutive was and is moronic. Even worse was the removal of blood dps; and frost and unholy as tank specs. And Blizzard developers don't grasp why there were fewer tanks.<br />
<br />
I loved DW Frost tanking. /weep<br />
<br />
On a different matter: I take insult with Chaud's statement about &quot;people didn't spend their first months steamrolling Naxxramas.&quot; Naxxramas destroyed my first serious guild (10 man) I was in because the gear requirement was too big a difference from dungeon gear. Blizzard developers admitted as much (can't source since it was on the old WoW forum). H Naxx was the only way many many players on my server even got to experience half of it, let alone all. If it was a decent group, it took ~4hrs. A difficult PuG with lots of replacing and wipes was just shy of ~6hrs.<br />
<br />
P.S. h4rr0d, I fixed your patch number. ;)<br />

<br />
I think the worst decision ever was to tune everything where you get progressively weaker. They inflated HP, put mana cost at a huge inflation but damage wasn't that high and then once they tackled in the gear then damage was through the roof. Just a very awkward approach.<br />
<br />
I didn't reach 85 and gave up because I felt I was playing a huge beta product as every week they were busy re-tuning classes and the game itself. Nothing worst than logging on and have your favorite spell or talent get dropped and forced you to relearn, re-itemize, and re-gem.<br />
<br />
Gold is easy at 85 right? Now when you just dropped 400-800g and suddenly Mastery is good again and you gotta re-gem again crap.<br />

I played my DK just up to 70... all I wanted to see was what the character can do, its storyline and experience a little of what I bought. It wasn't enough so I left.

&quot;Nothing left to do on my main character, better reroll!...I find this very strange, as I played only one character from beginning to end for Wrath. Actually 1 character since WoW first launched... My Rogue. Honestly I think I had more fun and more to do with my main character at the end of Wrath then any of the previous expansions combined!Between ICC Heroic 25, running heroic 5-mans, farming mounts (Aznu/Hawkstrider/Deathcharger), farming junkboxes for clients going for Insane in the membrane, selling lots of fun stuff on the AH and the occasional PVP weekend - I had a blast!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The most fun I EVER had playing WoW was TWINKING 20-29, 30-39, and 40-49, back in Vanilla while leveling my second 60. My guild and I fought other twinks/twink guilds. It was WoW at its most addicting for me. Whenever we decided to level out of the bracket, we grieved the decision. But the worst decision, in retrospect, was leveling out of the 40-49 bracket (the best imo), then leveling to 60. After a few weeks at 60, at least 4 of my guildies left the game completely. I was unfortunately more tolerant of the grindy, life-sucking bullsht of WoW, leveling through all the expansions -- 70, 80, then 85. But the game is not fun anymore (for me): I think veterans who still play the game do so out of habit, as I once did, to fill time. But when WoW becomes more intolerable than real-life boredom, that's saying something.<br />
<br />
I love WoW, man, I just wish it could somehow go back to its roots.<br />
<br />
About twinking, there are so many reasoned arguments against it in an MMO, the biggest being that it's the antithesis of progression. Okay sure. But had they not deprived the twinking community of its members by making it an all-or-none decision, I could still stand to look at the WSG and AB loading screen six years later. Like I've said before, Blizzard herds its players too strongly to the aspects of the game they want played. Consequently, they lose veteran players who knew how it was before. Why fix what wasn't broken? :(</div></div><hr />

Hurrdurr. It means people didn't spend the first six months of Cataclysm spamming Naxx on their 5th alt toon, because the raids were properly tuned, unlike WOTLK where I had four toons in full 213 Tier7 before Ulduar.</div></div><hr />

I hit level 80 with priest and warlock. Before cata I have made another priest (on different server and different side) and levelled it at 85, and then I levelled my old lock.

<br />
Nobody has any idea how many real people or accounts those 1M characters represent.<br />
<br />
For all anyone knows, 100% of the accounts in the 1M characters sample size are still active, this could mean that the average person had 3 characters at level 80 and only bothered levelling one of them to 85. The content isn't beaten for the vast majority of players, so it isn't exactly time to saturate alts.<br />
<br />
In short, these are meaningless numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
In early 2010 I had two level 80s. My main from beginning of wrath, and a main i switched to at the tail end of TOC to try out the new dungeon finder (when dps queues were instant) and raid ICC.<br />
<br />
Now I have 4 level 85s. <br />
<br />
The main reason for this is that i like the lack of burst in arenas and the rebalancing and shifting of emphasis on 3v3 (though 2 is terrible now with healer overpoweredness), it is possible to get games in easily in arenas every week... AND, it is ridiculously fast to level a character to 85 and not impossible to get pvp gear with a little bit of bg / arena grinding / tradeskills.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd love to take that same sample and know the number of unique accounts that had a charater at 80 back then that now have a character at 85. It is obviously more than ~33%</div></div><hr />

I think you mean &quot;Over 40% of the people who bothered to vote on MMOC poll say they are not playing anymore&quot;. This is hardly an indication of anything. Blizzard posting actual figures showing a loss in player base is an indication of decline, but this isn't. Want to know an interesting little secret? Hate spreads like wildfire on the internet, land of dickwads, twats and douchebags posting 'anonymously'. <br />
<br />
It's getting really out of hand lately. Take Dragon Age II, for example. A great game? No. A good game? Arguably. Guess what it has on metacritic? A 4.4. ...Yeah, a 4.4. I'd love to take all of those people aside and show them what a real 4.4 game is like. They'd probably weep.</div></div><hr />

Dragon Age II is indeed poop when comparing it to Dragon Age, and I guess that's what most reviewers did. But scores for games are informative in nature, you have to read the review and not just peek at the score - on the same note, A 4.4 for Dragon Age 2 doesn't mean it's on the same level as an XY Game with the same score. You can't compare WoW to Half-Life and so forth, especially not with scores.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lilbuddhaman</div><div class="date">2011-08-16, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well when a game like the witcher 2, which has equal (if not better) dialogue + voice acting , equal combat mechanics (DA2 might edge it out a bit), a more adult game with dialogue representing &quot;grey area&quot; choices, and VASTLY superior graphics that then gets a lower score by several websites, in-explicitly, people start metacritic 1.0 bombing.<br />
<br />
Blame the press for being bought out by the companies to give higher than deserved scores. DA2 should have gotten a &quot;solid&quot; 75-80%, but instead got numerous 90's (or equivalent). Then you have total bitches-to-the-industry like Kotaku, who purposely write their entire reviews in a positive tone (even when citing negatives), to completely confuse you. Their reviews read like the back of the box or a PR statement. Their old review system was also scoreless, but had a discernable &quot;we liked this, we hated that&quot; format to get a 'real' review.<br />
<br />
TLDR: Industry has gone to shit, just like the movie industry, welcome to the dark ages of Video Games. Hopefully it'll only last 5 years instead of the 30+ it took movies to turn their act around.</div></div><hr />

It costs more to fly from Greece to Blizzcon than from New York to Blizzcon. As well, EU nations have different laws and regulations than the USA when it comes to contests. Plus, I don't recall any where in the product description for curse premium that listed contests as a feature of the product. So if you pay for Curse Premium because you think you're going to be entitled to enter a contest, then you were already making a poor and uninformed decision.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps not, but scales exist for a reason and people still go by them. Your average Joe going to metacritic isn't going to read through all of the reviews, he's going to go &quot;4.4? what the shit&quot; and move on to the next game although he could easily enjoy a game like DA2. My point really is that people need to think for themselves and not just go with the flow.</div></div><hr />

WoW will never be thought of as hated, nor will Blizz but Cata was a huge mistake and the beta testers warned them well before it was released, that this would happen. If they wanted the Vanilla/TBC style back, they should have gone all in. The weird hybrid of old school annoyances and WotLK easymode is just a mess.

<br />
Your comment makes no sense. People votïng &quot;No&quot; doesnt mean that they are blizzard haters. <br />
<br />
In your logic, I can say the same thing - this poll sucks, all the blizzard fanboys are gonna vote &quot;yes&quot; just because they can! even if they dont play wow, they will still vote yes. <br />
<br />
The sample size already decides that the poll is quite reliable and accurate. And why 60/40 is even surprising to you? It is not at all for me, and sounds very logic, judged by current status of WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is so VERY TRUE as the case. Blizzard totally F-ed up the classes. A couple of things and reasons are:<br />
<br />
-PvP balance, at the end of WotLK, despite the content being horribly dull and the game just getting stale because of how quiet everything was prior to Cata, class balance was as close to perfect as it has ever been. To just totally go back on all that start changing things up like dispels. MS is just given to too damn many classes, but is also negligible, they needed to nerf Ms uptime not the amount (like 1-2 sec uptime as a debuff).<br />
<br />
Class uniqueness- DKs, multiple tank specs, Blood viable as DPS was fun as hell, Warlock drains/drain mana was not homogenized and actually fun back then, hunters using mana but not being a caster class just get shifted in with rogues on how they are to play now, ret now is supposed to play more like a DK/arms warrior now instead of the defensive style it used to with good heals and sacred shield or whatever it was. Warriors self healing was on an upward trend through bloodthirst and other methods, then come Cata it gets nerfed to the ground, along with DK self heals (melee classes that don't have things like sprint or vanish to fall back on) and rogues get self heals like everybody else now but better.<br />
<br />
-Players and class playstyles, they have relatively played all the same for the last 2 expansions of WoW, then come Cataclysm suddenly classes have got to play significantly different on many specs.<br />
<br />
-Tweaking to things we were once used to, like AoEs, old healing style (to some extent) tanking in general, how a lot of spells (again particularly AoE) and numerous other player/group dynamics. It becomes overwhelming and for many players a lot of extra needless work to be done to learn how to play the class again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
People didn't hit the &quot;Nothing left to do on my main character, better reroll!&quot; wall that they encountered in WotLK, raids were properly balanced and people didn't spend their first months steamrolling Naxxramas.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I got a LoL out of this. No, just no. People leveled up their mains to 85, geared them through normal dungeons and heroics, or battlegrounds if you PvP, did a month or twos worth of dailies and realized the entire strategy for Cataclysm was a grindfest, so instead of leveling an alt they quit the game entirely.<br />
<br />
That number of DKs represents players who switched their mains to DK during Cataclysm, FOTM UH DK for PvP, and to a lesser degree in 4.2 FOTM Frost DK for PVE DPS.</div></div><hr />

The sample size is big enough to reach a stable percentage result, which is quite reliable. <br />

Ofc, it is not based on all wow players or entire communtiy, but only MMO champion visitors. There are a lot of people who plays or plays not WoW dont ever visit MMO champion</div></div><hr />

Granted, I didn't play my Death Knight all that much to begin with and tanking was a chore because of Frost threat generation issues (which coincidentally they are addressing now), but I gave him up entirely because I despise Blood spec. I mean I do not like it at all. Too many abilities to deal with, icons very similar, didn't really feel the cohesion or synergy, just seemed...meh.But when you think about it, it's entirely possible that people who gravitated to Frost or Unholy tanking may have simply dropped the class entirely. Perhaps they should revisit this decision.</div></div><hr />

But if you don't want to raid 3 nights a week there's really nothing much to do except the same dailies to watch a tree grow, or collect coins for an epic that you'll only ever use in a 5 man. The whole expansion feels really, really thin on content.<br />
<br />
Call Wotlk Naxxramas whatever you want, at least people got some other stuff to do, and heroic raids like Ulduar actually changed the fight substantially. The huge gap between raiding and 'casual' has returned like it was in Vanilla and BC. Either you give up 3 of your evenings for raiding (and be honest, who wants to join a guild that raids once a week) or you unsubscribe.<br />

- Call of Duty<br />

I think you are slightly overestimating the number of people who have nothing better to do with their time than access mmo-champ from as many computers as they can find just to vote 'no' in response to a poll about a game they no longer play. I am rather surprised that the percent is so high myself, but assuming the above is just silly. It also doesn't say much about what you seem to think about the general playing population if you truly believe they are too lazy to click a button. btw if everyone were like you then youtube would be filled with nothing but disliked videos - pretty sure the general population uses the buttons as they are intended.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, the game really isn't for casual players. You simply can't enjoy an MMO with so little time to play, because of the demands. Achievements are great, but they really mean nothing. I enjoyed playing the game for many years - especially when raiding - but it's just got to the point where with so little time to play, if I did play it would be to grind dailies. And that isn't fun at all.<br />
<br />
I love my main and would love to be able to raid and run heroics and enjoy new, fresh and exciting stuff. But the time just isn't available to do so; and in not playing the game for over a month now, I've found that I have been able to start looking into games I've totally missed out on over the last five or six years. It's somewhat refreshing.<br />
<br />
Still, you can't help but feel a connection to the game even after quitting. With so much invested over the years, it truly does seem a shame to just let it all go. Maybe patch 4.3 will bring me back and I will once again find the fun factor that a casual player should still be able to experience.</div></div><hr />

Very kind post, and what explains how a lot of my friends (not me) feel about the game in it's current state. Disappointment after disappointment, and a serious design mythos and flaw here and there, have lead to the game being so...well, it's explained above.

A serious chunk of my life over the last half a decade has been spent playing this game. I have now let my subscription lapse and do not intend to go back. The main reason, lack of any content worthy of my time. I think, along with many others, the game reached its pinnacle during TBC and has never since been as engrossing or as fun to play or raid. It's not the changing of the game to appeal to casuals or vice versa, it is the lack of inspirational content. There was just no reason to log in anymore when all I was doing was running dailies and the same heroics over and over again..... booooring. Anyone remember the events leading up the release of TBC.... those were the most interesting and fun filled times playing the game.... nothing like a elite giant attacking Stormwind and reaping havoc.</div></div><hr />

My husband and I are in the same boat. Bored to death of dailies, the new content is horribly boring, dungeons and raids are insanely long wipefests which only serves to frustrate things, and PVP is for the hardcore.<br />
<br />
So...we quit. Clearly Blizzard didn't realize that finally allowing 'bads' to see the endgame meant that we expected to see it again. If you're going to punish people for hopping guild, any guild should be able to at least do the normal modes with minimal complications. Unfortunately, that wasn't that case in 4.0, or 4.1 so we quit. Yeah, I know they nerfed them in 4.2, but I didn't feel like paying money for 3 months of no updates to get there.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iamdisappoint</div><div class="date">2011-08-26, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I for one liked old frost tanking, and Blood DPS talent trees. I was considering making a DK my main (instead i quit the game) new DKs kind of sucked, Blood was awesome and self healing to be substantially noticeable like it was in WotLK for all classes that had it, especially for PvE.<br />
I hate a number of the class changes, leveling to 85 sucked.<br />
<br />
I agree with what this post is implying ... the main reason there are less DKs overall is they destroyed the class for a large portion of players. DKs used to be a 'play it how you want to' class. Want to tank? You could in Blood, Unholy, and Frost. You could even dw tank if you wanted. Want to dps? all three trees were viable to a good player.<br />
<br />
I didn't touch my DK for a while because I loved blood dps, and was great at it and was already a blood tank as os. It took me a while to adjust and he was benched for a very long time. I did a lot of trials on the PTR before 4.0 hit, and could see merit in the new unholy and adjusted to doing 2h frost, but, was just not inspired, and the blood tank revamp was an adjustment as well.<br />
<br />
I can assume that a lot of blood dps, frost and unholy tanks were part of the decline of the class. Why play something that they removed the playstyle you loved so much ... just go to another toon that you enjoyed similarly.<br />
<br />
As far as not playing, most of the people I've played with have quit, and I'll not renew my sub when it expires in a few months. To quote BB King 'the thrill is gone' and so has a large portion of the irl and out social draw for me.</div></div><hr />
