Ulduar PTR Testing Information<br />
This is starting to look good ... PTR Tonight? <br />
Earlier tonight an Official preview of Ulduar (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=39711.0) was published.<br />
Also today, Blizzard announced plans for its 4th Blizzcon to be held on August 21 and 22 in Anaheim (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=39705.0).<br />
You can also check the existing Patch 3.1 information compilation (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=38462.0)<br />
<br />
Ok, we're getting close to the point where we will need testing of Ulduar boss encounters on PTR, so let's talk about Ulduar testing!<br />
<br />
We're going to be performing testing differently than in the past. We're looking for much more targeted feedback, and we don't want to just have the zone freely open and allow extended, unsupervised testing to take place. So, when the PTR servers come up with 3.1.0, by default Ulduar will be turned completely off. We'll instead enable Ulduar and specific bosses during times where the encounter team can observe testing.<br />
<br />
Shortly after 3.1.0 PTR is up and running, I'll post a schedule that will indicate when we will open specific bosses to testing. We'll have testing opportunities for both EU and NA region PTRs in their respective prime time playing hours. There might also be a boss or two we do leave up for extended testing, and some bosses will only be tested in either the EU or NA. Some encounters won't be up on the PTR at all! There's 14 boss encounters in Ulduar, there will be lots to test. The schedule will be quite flexible, check in the Dungeons &amp; Raids forum and on the PTR forum for updates.<br />
<br />
The first set of boss encounters to get testing will include:<br />
Freya<br />
Thorim<br />
Hodir<br />
The Iron Council<br />
<br />
Both 10 player and 25 player versions of the encounters will be open to testing, and we expect players to have nearly full Naxxramas gear. While Jillian McWeaksauce might make appearances on the PTR to provide testing consumables, please try to bring your own.<br />
<br />
I hope to see raid groups of many different skill levels on the 3.1.0 PTR servers when they become available! <br />
<br />
Additional info on first boss<br />
The first boss has you enter 1 of 3 different vehicles (Chopper, Demolisher, and Siege Engine) to fight your way through an immense Iron army to the Flame Leviathan and defeat him. After that, there's very little use of vehicles by players. We'll have the fight up on the PTR at a later date, but this fight isn't in the first wave of boss encounters to be tested. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/15211802094-ulduar-info-is-up.html))<br />
<br />
Actually, the effectiveness of the vehicles in the Flame Leviathan fight changes depending on the quality of the gear. So someone in full Naxxramas epics (or Ulduar epics!) will have an easier time than someone in greens. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/15198911238-concerning-ulduar-and-the-future-of-raiding.html))<br />
<br />
Ulduar PTR Testing<br />
We'll be monitoring the EU PTRs and the EU forums for feedback quite a bit, actually. For us as encounter designers, EU testing is awesome because we can watch testing in your evenings during our normal business hours. There will also be some EU only bosses for PTR testing, along with some NA only bosses. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/8041846834-ulduar-ptr-testing-information.html))<br />

Blue posts<br />
Patch 3.1 ETA<br />
We're working to get 3.1 up soon. It won't have all of the class changes in it initially though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14990478868-hunter-nerfs-agreed-upon-by-top-hunters.html))<br />
<br />
Dual Specialization<br />
Dual spec is a big, new feature for us. It will probably change the game in ways nobody (ourselves included) can predict. As such, we want to be careful. However we also want to be able to generate a lot of feedback on it. That is one reason we announced the feature with as much detail as we could. You can also expect to see it on the PTR for a reasonable amount of time.<br />
<br />
We might very well change our minds on the max level and / or Inscription part of the feature. Your feedback on all of that has been appreciated. (And folks on EU and other forums, don't feel like your voice is not heard just because I tend to post on the USA forums.)<br />
<br />
I didn't mean to suggest that we won't ever make early announcements again because some mean players hurt our feelings. (I'm old and crusty and my feelings are almost impossible for you guys to hurt.) But the things we say do get quoted a lot, and often out of context; the blue lines get reproduced, but not usually the questions or posts that led to our responses. Kotaku picked up the announcement of un-nerfing BM hunters on what must have been a very slow news day. <br />
<br />
We certainly understand that forum posters are by far the minority of players and often those with a bone to pick. As always, we appreciate the constructive feedback and extend our gratitude to players who can offer comment without freaking out. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14990657573-dual-spec-disappointment-healing.html))<br />
<br />
Ulduar Tanking - Bring the Player, not the class<br />
We're not going to promise that every tank has equal difficulty with every fight in the game, particularly those that are designed to be extra challenging. We'll get as close as we can, but at some point unless we give the exact same abilities to every class, some abilities or emphasized stats are just going to work better in some cases than others.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, we will avoid very gimmicky fights where you are &quot;supposed to&quot; swap out to a particular class to tank. You won't see a boss in Ulduar that wipes the raid unless Infected Wounds and only Infected Wounds is kept up on him. (Even Razuvious 25 is probably closer than we want to get in the future).<br />
<br />
It doesn't help matters that there is only one super challenging encounter in the game now, so &quot;the best tank&quot; tends to get judged by that alone. It would feel different if there were 3 hard fights and different tanks were superior for each of them. (I said &quot;superior&quot; not &quot;impossible without&quot;.)<br />
<br />
It's awesome that so many players have adopted the &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; mantra. I think we managed to get that message across. Do remember however that its original context was that after you have the major buffs and debuffs covered that you will have room to bring who you want and generally a lot more flexibility on which classes you need to bring. It doesn't mean that you can put together any kind of contrived raid comp and then point the finger at us when your 12 prot warrior group wipes in Ulduar. But that also doesn't mean we are reneging on our promise that you can MT with any of four classes. Just remember things are going to feel the least equitable on the hardest fights. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/15199329893-bring-player-not-class-how-can-we.html))<br />
<br />
Talent design and popularity<br />
I don't think Blizzard would agree with that. If nobody ever takes the talent, then yes, there is probably something wrong with it. But I don't know that we would ever want to see say an Arms warrior build that didn't take Mortal Strike. We don't want to make attractive alternatives to Mortal Strike. We pretty much want you to take Mortal Strike. The same is true of Titan's Grip for Fury and Toughness for Protection.<br />
<br />
You can come up with examples for classes too. Omen of Clarity is near mandatory for all druids. Ruin is something every PvE warlock wants.<br />
<br />
I can understand how logically someone would approach the task of talent design with the goal of making every talent choice optional and equal. But talent tree design turns out to be more complicated than that one simple rule. To consider just a few factors:<br />
<br />
The cost of a talent often has as much to do with its prereqs or talents in above tiers than in the talent cost itself.<br />
The value of a talent has a lot to do with the other talents you choose.<br />
We spend a lot of time playing games about what a spec gives up in order to get a particular talent.<br />
Bigger numbers (damage or healing) tend to trump utility abilities for PvE and the opposite is true for PvP.<br />
The exact same talent may be just fine for one class but overpowered for another.<br />
Above all, ask yourself what else you would spend those points on. We don't want to see just a ton of 0 / 0 / 71 specs. We haven't really given Holy or Shadow much reason to sub-spec into each other. Maybe sub-specing into Disc isn't so bad if there is something really juicy there for you. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14990442254-blizzard-its-time-baseline-meditation.html))<br />
<br />
Healing Design - Goals and Mana Regeneration<br />
1) I was trying to argue (perhaps too politely) that the notion that healing was fun when smart people could take healing breaks to allow for out of five-second-rule regen was a little bit of rosy nostalgia. The way expert raiders handled that was by healer rotations or stopcasting macros, and I don't seriously think a lot of people long for the return of those. (No doubt some do.) Sunwell and similar content were tuned to where you couldn't realistically stop casting for regen anyway. If you are stopping now, it's because Naxxramas is easy. On challenging content, all 4 classes already spammed heals pretty consistently. That meant the out of FSR breaks came mostly from clearcasting procs or encounter mechanics that forced you to pause. When that happened, mana felt limitless. As I've said, we would rather shift back a little (A LITTLE) from GCD-constrained healing to mana-constrained healing.<br />
<br />
2) It sounds like some of you are saying that even on challenging content without replenishment and without leaving the FSR your mana is infinite. I am a slightly skeptical of such claims, but we'll see what happens in Ulduar. We think you will run out of mana sometimes, particular on very hard fights or if you aren't playing at your best, even with replenishment. Similarly, we feel like the paladins are noticing the Divine Plea change in PvE. If you aren't, then perhaps you are an amazing healer, or perhaps Naxx isn't challenging you much. Now, if it turns out regen is still just too good, then replenishment would definitely be our next target. But we don't think we're far off. This isn't a &quot;to the ground&quot; scenario.<br />
<br />
3) This change won't change the relative values of Int and Spirit. Int was already a good regen stat (in part because it provides other bonuses). However, you are rarely ever choosing between a +100 Int chest and a +100 Spirit chest (though you might be with gems). More to the point though, the regen formula is SQRT of Int * Spirit * a constant. We are just lowering the constant. If Spirit was good for you before, it will still be good for you. If the only reason it was good for you before was because you took a lot of out of FSR breaks, well 1) again I am skeptical, and 2) yes, under that specific situation you will notice a nerf to your regen.<br />
<br />
Overall, our goal is not to make healing more difficult across the board (though we do want mana to matter more). Our goal is to make healing more interesting. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14990765234-i-dont-get-the-regen-nerfs.html))<br />
<br />
And nobody's stood around taking healing rotation breaks since early MC, and no one here is arguing for a return to that.<br />
I agree with that first part, Odes, but I think some people are arguing that the rotation breaks are what OOFSR healing was all about. We aren’t really pushing for a return to that. <br />
<br />
Healing rotations and &quot;spammy&quot; gameplay<br />
We don’t want that either. Most of my posts have been trying to say “We don’t want the healing game to be a spammy one.” (Again, some players are arguing they do want that, which is their prerogative). However, we are also backing off of the thing that prevents the spams to be the FSR game. I think a better solution is interesting spells. Swiftmend is a really interesting spell. So are Lifebloom, Penance and Beacon of Light. Prayer of Mending is a very effective spell, but I don’t think it’s a particularly fun one to cast. I do think Holy priests could use some work in the fun department, which has been a pretty consistent thread for the last several weeks on these forums, and something we are working on.<br />
<br />
I also think some paladins do like the way paladin healing plays out. I’m not saying we want to adopt that model in every case, but we shouldn’t dismiss it either. (Similarly, I am not dismissing players who thought the FSR rule was fun, and in fact we aren’t removing it, just reducing its impact).

Death Knight 3.1 Changes<br />
The DK talent trees are changing quite a bit. We only listed a few of the changes. More equality among the three trees in PvP and PvE are high on the list. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15211001738-dk-talents-in-31.html))<br />

Mana Regeneration changes in 3.1 and effects on Innervate<br />
I don't think it will suddenly make druids regem from Spirit to Int. We'll see.<br />
<br />
If you mean these changes will nerf Innervate, yes, it will. On live Innervate can be 120% of your bar, say 25,000 mana. Historically it was more like 75% of your bar, and it should be closer to that with these changes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14990765234-i-dont-get-the-regen-nerfs.html))<br />

Hunters in PvP<br />
Aside from the random stun of TNT and a couple of the bugs mentioned, we don't think hunters are grossly imbalanced in PvP at the moment. Explosive Shot might be a bit too high, but we aren't nerfing it for the moment. We'll see how things feel once some of the changes to other classes are in place.

Totem Stomping Macros<br />
We don't like totem stomping macros. Destroying a totem should be a choice and require at least a modicum of player attention. That is one of the main differences between totems and other types of spells and we don't want everyone to just opt out of that difference.<br />
<br />
Preventing them isn't always easy to do, but we do try and stay on top of it. We did stop it for a short time, but players found a way around it. And, no, just naming the totems after the player won't solve the problem or we would have done it long ago. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/15207811625-blue--totem-stomping-macros.html))<br />

Patch 3.1 Stances changes<br />
We made those announcements to get a little bit of discussion going and give players some insight into the kind of changes we are looking into for the next patch. It's not a comprehensive list of patch notes and isn't even likely to match what you see on the PTR when it first goes up. It is something new we wanted to try.<br />
<br />
I am not sure we will end up changing the way rage works with stance changes at this stage because I'm not sure we can solve the problems it causes without creating new ones. I could see a system where you always keep a minimum of rage and never lose more than a maximum of rage, but at that point the feature may be so convoluted that you have to ask why have rage change at all?<br />
<br />
But I do want to thank those of you who engaged in the discussion exploring the pros and cons without just freaking out. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14990658904-warrior-31-stances-a-crippling-oversight-2.html))<br />
<br />
100 rage -&gt; 50 rage; 90 rage -&gt; 45 rage; 80 rage -&gt; 40 rage; 70 rage -&gt; 35 rage; 60 rage -&gt; 30 rage; 50 rage -&gt; 25 rage; 40 rage -&gt; 20 rage (will always keep 20 rage upon changing stances if &gt;= 20)<br />
I understand that may get you what you want out of stance dancing, but it’s just not the kind of change we would be likely to do. Even if the tooltip was as simple as “divides your rage in half up to a minimum of 20,” that still requires a lot more quick calculation than just knowing “If I change stances, I will be at 10 rage.” We could probably make it work, but frankly, we’d rather just leave it as it is. We still want the foundation of the class to be changing stances to use specific abilities, but at the cost of most of your rage. I do think we can make stances more interesting though, and I've said that is something we are working on. <br />
<br />
Heroic Leap removal<br />
Quick positional movement of any kind is not a strength of most client – server based games. I will point out that it is typically the Charge glyph that causes most of the complaining because it adds just a little bit more distance. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14990658904-warrior-31-stances-a-crippling-oversight-2.html))<br />
<br />
Change heroic leap (I miss you!) to work like kitty leap ie. TARGETED, HOW FRIGGING HARD WOULD IT HAVE BEEN! <br />
It would have been easy. We predicted that the response from the warrior community would be “Oh great, I get yet another charge with different art. Thanks Blizzard.” Kitty leap is valuable to druids because they had no other fast movement short of changing forms. Warriors already have 3 abilities to do that in different circumstances. Heroic Leap was interesting because it didn't require a target. Unfortunately, it also caused jumping through the world, cheating through walls, or getting stuck, none of which were worth whatever cool factor the talent would have brought. We might have the technology to do it in the future though. Pulling Heroic Leap doesn't mean we hate warriors or don't know what we want to do with them. It was just overly ambitious for the time.

Scratch Mimir off the list. It says in the flavor text that Mimir built the Flame Leviathan. I highly doubt they'd make the creator a separate encounter.

<br />
<br />
Actually, the latest quotes say &quot;There's 14 boss encounters in Ulduar, there will be lots to test.&quot; 14 boss encounters != 14 bosses.<br />
<br />
Also, judging purely by 3.0.9 game map files, there are the following &quot;spots&quot; for bosses:<br />
<br />
2 in the &quot;staging area,&quot; aka the vehicular zone before the rest of the nonlinear instance. These 2 bosses are The Flame Leviathan and Algalon the Observer.<br />
<br />
The main hall of Ulduar has 7 &quot;wings.&quot; 2 pairs of wings connect into one another. The pair on the right, the frost wing, contains Hodir. The pair on the left has room for 1, possibly 2 boss fights. The remaining wing on the left was completely undeveloped and blank, assume 1 fight. The remaining wing on the right leads to the arena with the Iron Council. The wing front and center leads to the garden area with Freya. <br />
<br />
After all bosses are killed, the raid is granted access to the final area of Ulduar (think Frostwyrm Lair from Naxx). This will have 1-2 bosses.<br />
<br />
In all, I'm counting anywhere between 9 and 14 areas where a boss fight can occur. We'll just have to wait and see...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, on the official site there's a picture of a giant robot-looking thing. I assume it's Mimir.<br />
<br />
To all the people confused about Freya, the Avatar in Sholazar is basically a computer program that Freya set up. In a quest chain in Storm Peaks, you go around to all the different temples, and clarify that the Watchers, who are Freya, Hodir, Mimir and Tyr, have all gone missing. Thorim may be a Watcher as well, I'm not exactly sure. In any case, since we're fighting Hodir, Freya and Thorim, I'd be really surprised if we don't fight Mimir and Tyr as well.</div></div><hr />

But if you also look in the background of the picture behind the robot there's another big orange/teal blob thing which looks a lot like it. So I took it as this is just a trash mob and not necessarily a boss.</div></div><hr />

well read the news carefully :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, the effectiveness of the vehicles in the Flame Leviathan fight changes depending on the quality of the gear. So someone in full Naxxramas epics (or Ulduar epics!) will have an easier time than someone in greens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I take that news to mean that the abilities your vehicle has will scale according to how good your gear is. while this is a good thing, and one of the big things I dislike about malygos (you can have BiS gear and you'll still do the same damage on a drake as if you are naked). however, I don't think it detracts from my arguement at all. infact I think it would further support it if blizz is making even more (new) changes to the system, there's likely to be even more problems with it, not less.<br />
<br />
I do like varity, but the whole &quot;this is new and exciting, so lets force this annoying vehicle mechanics into these fights&quot; is just, yeah, fail ...</div></div><hr />

We're gonna encounter them, and once we beat them, they won't actually die, something like Kalecgos, and the three will have something to do once we fight the final boss, or something near the final boss, much like Kalecgos once again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-heimdal(im) (guardian of the entrance to asgard)<br />
-vølva(im) (a prophet/shaman/truthteller/seer etc.. knows the past and the future)<br />
-nidhug(im) (a dragon eating the roots of the world tree... dragon.. im fairly sure we will see a dragon)<br />
-council of einherhjers (souls of the greatest warriors who died in battle in middleearth)<br />
-council of valkyries (elite guards and messengers of odin and protectors of asgard)<br />
-balder(im) (son of odin - in norse mythological lore he was killed by loke(n))<br />
-hel (this is a very high candidate - since shes the ruler of the underworld (hell))<br />
-tyr (highly likely as a candidate as well - since hes another son of odin<br />
<br />
also another thing they raped from the norse mythology entirely is the world tree.. which in norse mythology is known as &quot;yggdrasil&quot;<br />
<br />
heres some other info for you :D (for those that care about mythological lore and its influence on our everyday lives :P)<br />
actually the names of the days we use to describe weekdays are derived from the norse mythology<br />
<br />
monday - moons day (the start of the week)<br />
tuesday - tyrs day (dk/swe/no ~ tirsdag)<br />
wednesday - odins day (dk/swe/no ~ onsdag) (i have no idea where &quot;wednes&quot; was derived from)<br />
Thursday - thors day (dk/swe/no ~ torsdag)<br />
Friday - freyas day (dk/swe/no ~ fredag)<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway.. the list goes on and on.. tho.. if they are indeed leeching more stuff off the norse mythology then theres a very good chance that they at least used the known lore to derive some encounters.<br />
<br />
- fx.. freya will have wolves to protect her (adds)<br />
- thor will use thunder and lightning abilities<br />
...etc..etc..<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
OH, also another fact.. the &quot;ragnarok&quot; .. or in other words the &quot;end of the world&quot; depicts another picture - which im quite sure they will adopt into ulduar since theres so much raping of norse gods in there.<br />
<br />
the ragnarok is supposed to start off with a huge battle .. depicting the death of:<br />
-odin<br />
-thor<br />
-freya<br />
-heimdall<br />
-loke<br />
<br />
Since loke(n) is already (supposedly) dead - and thor(im) and freya have been comfirmed.. its quite possible we will see the other guys as well.<br />

The name comes from the Middle English Wednes dei, which is from Old English language W&#275;dnes dæg, meaning the day of the English god Woden (Wodan) who was a god of the Anglo-Saxons in England until about the 7th century. W&#275;dnes dæg is like the Old Norse Oðinsdagr (&quot;Odin's day&quot;), which is an early translation of the Latin dies Mercurii (&quot;Mercury's day&quot;), and reflects the widespread association of Woden with Mercury going back to Tacitus.<br />

Seriously, no ordinary person cares about your so-called &quot;raping&quot; of some silly, ignorant tribal mythos. It's an amusing/interesting set of stories that thousands of writers, artists and content creators establish vague allusions to on a regular basis (along with every other silly tribal mythos' found in the world).<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking forward to the year when a MMO expansion feeds of biblical motives and somebody uses the above quote :D <br />
<br />
The religion that you cannot make fun of today is the silly, ignorant tribal mythos of tomorrow.<br />

Moreover, it appears that Norse mythology is heavily based on Vedic ideas, the big giveaway being the number of warriors who spew forth from Valhalla is 432,000 which is the exact same as the number of syllables in the Rg Veda.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I'm pretty bored at the moment so I'll look it up....and...Merriam-Webster says mythos is: &quot;a pattern of beliefs expressing often symbolically the characteristic or prevalent attitudes in a group or culture&quot;. Maybe that doesn't jive with some niche academic nomenclature, but w/e, ya know? ::) And what does &quot;Vedic&quot; anything have to do with... well, anything? What are you on about? :o<br />

<br />
Not quite - the kept Kil'Jaeden off the PTR in the Sunwell raid and I think no-one actually downed Muru on the PTR either before it went live. Of course, all the drops were datamined so we all knew what sort of items we could be getting though.<br />
<br />
Ok, so that's like 95% of the content was made available on the PTR before it went live, but at least they started learning in the end and kept some stuff back. I'm hoping they'll at least kept the final couple of bosses off the PTR this time - there's 14 of them but only 11 have 'hard' modes. If it's the last couple that don't have hard modes, I'd like them to be kept back to make them more challenging when it goes live.</div></div><hr />

Hunters in PvP<br />
Aside from the random stun of TNT and a couple of the bugs mentioned, we don't think hunters are grossly imbalanced in PvP at the moment.

Give me a break. Reading the SOURCE of this post, it seems this guy is obviously just another QQer thats not used to be beaten by a hunter in PVP Arena. He even admits there arent many hunters in top ranked team, but he wants them to get nerfed even so! Huntards dont belong in high ranked arena right?<br />
<br />
Seriously, learn to start playing this game. Nerfing survival spec will only result in alot of rerolling. If the class has some bugs, sure fix it but please stop complaining about the CC of a hunter!? Warlocks, Rogues, Mages ALL PURE DPS classes have a way better CC then a hunter has, and ever will get. I hope the new trapping mechanism lets hunters alow to THROW a freezing trap and instant TRAP. Is that more OP then a mage sheep, a warlock fear, a or a rofl rogue? Dont think so.<br />
<br />
If any hunters need MORE survivability, Deterrence apply 360 degrees AND works vs paladin seals and dots. People stop ur QQing about hunters for at least a few months, and accept the fact that hunters are here in ARENA! And were here to stay!</div></div><hr />

<br />
TBC was the 1st expansion for the game. WotLK for sure had a easier time (since the expansion mechanics like how should would work with the current game, were alread worked out for TBC). Remember that in fact, WotLK was alread avaible in &quot;beta&quot; for months. Don't remember TBC in beta for that long (and really in beta, not under developement while in &quot;beta&quot;).<br />
<br />
Also remember that Blizzard said that they don't want Arthas &quot;on farm&quot; before the new xpac. So they want it to be more like SWP, you go, kill arthas few times while the xpac is around the corner. With less time between Arthas patch and new xpac.</div></div><hr />

So because one survival hunter got lucky once with a particular shot (which has a 10 sec cooldown anyway) against a player who we've got no idea what gear your wearing 'fully epic' could be PVP gear, PVE stuff brought from the AH or T7.5 stuff that we should, in fact, be nerfing them?<br />
<br />
Hunters have always been constantly one of the worse classes to play in PVP. Other classes have their 'good' and 'bad' periods (Warlocks = Good in tbc, bad in WotLK for example) but hunters have never had a 'good' time in PVP.</div></div><hr />

moron, first look into a classes forums fpr rotations and then post; a good hunter uses aimed straight off the CD as long as ES isnt off CD because it scales better, our talents affect it (sniper training) and it does more damage than SS, so why not?<br />

I'm assuming you mean Kill Shot, and not Aimed shot, since I've never seen those kinds of numbers on an aimed shot :)<br />

When it comes to kill shot, don't get so damn hung up on the high damage, since it's only usable below 20%. It's just eye candy. 5k would actually suffice in most cases.</div></div><hr />

I agree. Those Deterrence changes would be perfect.<br />

<br />
He was probably in WG and the Hunter had Tenacity.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what probably happened. That or he's a clothie with 0 resil and armor buffs and got hit by kill shot from a PVE geared hunter.<br />
<br />
In my pretty good PVP gear, I see ~11k crits on kill shot on 0 resil clothies. It crits anybody with good resil and an armor buff for 5-6k. Again though, it's only below 20%, it's meant to be an execute.</div></div><hr />

Would be like saying that killing Mu'ru gets you hated with the Shatar and in-turn Scryers and aldor. :)<br />
<br />
I gather you said that in jest though. :)</div></div><hr />

I don't know if Dual Specs will be available for testing once the PTR is online, but I hope they are.</div></div><hr />

2) will purchasing the new designs for epic gems from vendors require same tokens?<br />
Thank you in advance</div></div><hr />

SURVIVAL<br />
<br />
::)<br />
<br />
<br />
Plz dont post if u dont know what ur talking about, it makes you look stupid! Aimedshot barely crits 6k on a lvl 1 critter.<br />
KILL SHOT on the other hand can crit for around 13k, but only when the target is under 20%, and its meant to FINISH a target. Im in full PVP epics deadly/hatefull and my Kill Shot crits for 11k on trash, but around 7k on a well geared PVP player. You just fail beyond recognition.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm. Mutilate didn't hit for 13k and they nerfed it hard.<br />
<br />
Maybe they need to do the same to hunters; tone down aimed shot and give them a buff somewhere else. Or not give them a buff. I don't think aimed shot is used much in PvE, so its not like you're nerfing their DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dont asume everything some random guy claims to be truthfull. U hear somone say aimedshot crit for 13k, and you immediately want it to get nerfed. Get your facts straight before posting! Its ppl like you 2 that QQ on official forums calling out random stuff. But when you say Aimed Shot is not used in PVE nobody will take you serious anyway, which is a good thing!</div></div><hr />

Presumably since it's the healing class he's got most healing experience with, but I'd love to see his thoughts on fun, spamminess and variation of the Paladin as a healing class. Usually when Paladins are brought up, the text contains the words &quot;performance&quot;, &quot;efficiency&quot; or even &quot;healing meter&quot;. Makes them sound like a german villain from a Bond movie more than a class that's a fun past time playing.</div></div><hr />

What concenrs do you mean? There wont be epic gems in 3.1. .... its too early, maybe in 3.2. but more likely in Icecrown 3.3.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammysam</div><div class="date">2009-02-21, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So when is the PTR actually coming up?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stupid11</div><div class="date">2009-02-21, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're going to be performing testing differently than in the past. We're looking for much more targeted feedback, and we don't want to just have the zone freely open and allow extended, unsupervised testing to take place. So, when the PTR servers come up with 3.1.0, by default Ulduar will be turned completely off. We'll instead enable Ulduar and specific bosses during times where the encounter team can observe testing.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just want to reiterate this. PTR forums are spammed with &quot;full epix X class LF ptr guild!!111&quot;<br />
<br />
All those people are in for a rude awakening.</div></div><hr />
