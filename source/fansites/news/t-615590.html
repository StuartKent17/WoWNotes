The armor used for higher quality sets (Deadly Gladiator and Hateful Gladiator) uses the same model, just like the weapons only the color will change slightly. The Death Knight set was updated in 8970 and the helm now looks bigger. <br />

We all have a set to our own ability, which can come at quite a fast rate really as honor will be easy to make and the Arena Points cost seems reasonably low. If they just add some sort of Battleground set or Rep set to start us off gearing for PvP it would be good this system. (Maybe the rep/bg set is already in beta). I think it would also require some sort of lvl 80 arena rating, as everything past 70 with arena is wiped.</div></div><hr />

So people should have virtually no chance of catching up amirite? How do you propose someone starting arena/gearing an alt is to obtain arena gear so as to be competitive? Perhaps they've obtained the 1700&gt; pr gear and are working towards 1800 for the weap? It makes no difference to you if you're a good player with gear if &quot;scrubs&quot; have the gear, other than makes the epeenage worth less - and ratings are enough for that anyway. Make pr reqs too high and people won't play - the balance just isn't good enough for it to be too hardcore.</div></div><hr />

Very easily.<br />
<br />
Farm the blue PvP gear, then work your way to the epic Hateful PvP gear. The ratings are pretty low (1665-1825 to get all gear +weapons) and you'll be more than well geared to work towards your Deadly gear.<br />
<br />
And it's not about people not being able to 'catch up'. Hell I've done it. I went from full blue PvP gear in season 3, to 4/5 brutal gear in season 4.<br />
<br />
<br />
Balance is fine. EVERY class can hit 2200 rating with the right combo.</div></div><hr />

Why the fuck do you need PVP gear then? Certainly not Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
The only reason to have PVP gear in a BG is because the other team has it too. Guess what, if it's not available to you, it's not available to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
GG, Arena points needed for every piece of PVP gear in this shoddy game now.<br />
<br />
Thanks Blizz you bunch asshats.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do baddies always blame Blizzard? Grats, you can't AFK AV premades for 80 hours for your almost-as-good as the best PVP gear in the game the moment you hit 80.<br />

Also, doesn't anyone remember season 1? Probably not because I bet half of you weren't playing back then. Guess what, you couldn't get purple sets from honor in season 1 then either. High warlord gear was almost as worthless as it is from vendors now. I think I used 2 pieces of it, max. PVE gear is better for PVP than that worthless crap. (High warlord weapons were *beyond* bad. Trust me, there was ZERO point to buying one of them, the Ring of Blood weapons were just as good.)<br />
<br />
And you can still buy every other piece for straight honor. So no, arena points aren't needed for &quot;every&quot; piece of PVP gear. In fact, you CAN'T buy belt, boots, bracer, neck, ring, trinket for arena points. You NEED honor for those slots.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">olga</div><div class="date">2008-09-21, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to me that there are subltle differences in the 10 and 25 man armor sets. Not in color, but actual models.<br />
Compared to their respective 10 man sets the following have the differences:<br />
Druid Set - 25 man shoulders have taller spikes and extra gem things hanging on the side / chest.<br />
Hunter Set - 25 man shoulders have extra spike / hook things.<br />
Mage Set - 25 man shoulders have different crystals on em, and the helm has a shadowy effect over the eyes.<br />
Shaman Set - 25 man shoulders have extra horns over them.<br />
Warlock Set - 25 man shoulders have extra tentacle things on them.<br />
Warrior set - 25 man shoulders and helm have blades on them.<br />
<br />
Looking at the DK, Paladin, Priest and Rogue sets, I don't see anything that makes them different. I know these models may still be placeholders, but I think if blizz bothered doing it for ~half the classes, they should go ahead and do it for all classes so you can tell the difference between the 10 and 25 man sets (atleast helm and shoulders) apart easier.</div></div><hr />

Yet another proof of my thesis that the raiding part of the WoW-community is indeed the more mature, less extreme part. This is of course only individual impression, and there ARE exceptions, but the quota of especially louth-mouted morons seems to be quite big in the Arena-section of the game.<br />
<br />
With you, the fun starts only in that last paragraph. Either you are a brilliant master of irony (and I bow to you for that!) or you are really weird enough to believe that you are one of the &quot;old gang&quot; because you've been arround since Season 1. Seriously, don't spill all over your pants there dude, its only one year out of three...<br />
Had you been arround a bit longer, though, you would have noticed obviously that High Warlord-Gear was never ment to be a season 1-addition. That, in fact, it had not been changed at all since level 60, when it was one hell of a weapon/armour-set. And dammit, it still looks hot! Yet, its nice to see you making a fool out of yourself.<br />
<br />
Now thats settled, on the rating-issue: I guess I'm kinda fine with it, since handing out top-end welfare-items over a system that doesn't include any sort of challenge or archievement, but only time, doesn't feel right. Thats why they introduced the ratings, and its not too bad an idea, neither for the pvp-elite, who can now show arround some of their accomplishments, nor for the pve-elite, who don't have to feel like spending their nights wiping all for nothing when similar weapons were obtainable through arena.<br />
<br />
But just like they did with badges-gear in PVE, they should really give us some sort of foot in the door to enter Arena lateron. For me, Arena died mid-season 3 because I simply couldn't have ANY fun anymore playing somewhat casually, with the gear difference becoming ever more important. It seems a bit unfair to me that with PvE, you get good enough gear to compete pretty easily, while with PvP, you now will be FORCED to spend a lot of time and effort only to equip yourself to a level where you are not yet a challenge, but at least not the laughable worm you are right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it's not about people not being able to 'catch up'. Hell I've done it. I went from full blue PvP gear in season 3, to 4/5 brutal gear in season 4.<br />
<br />
<br />
Balance is fine. EVERY class can hit 2200 rating with the right combo.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure every class can hit 2200 ratings, but its pretty obvious that some classes find it tougher - e.g. holy paladins in 2s and 3s - and thats where there are balancing issues. Look at the statistics for gladiators according to class. Its clear that things aren't balanced. If you think otherwise you're wilfully blind.<br />
<br />
The rating reqs for armour were fine in s4, thats why you were able to get the 4/5 brutal - they're obtainable for players wearing honour gear. Are you saying that you didn't deserve your 4/5 brutal? I just don't think the 1700 rating reqs were &quot;too easy&quot; - they're about right. If someone can get a pr of 1700 they're not shit, and they deserve a reward - being stuck with s2 weap/shoulder is enough of an indication of their &quot;non-elite&quot; status.

wasn't devine shield changed to a kind of shield wall? so you won't get immune to physical damage but just get a damage reduction for the time it's up?</div></div><hr />

Look at the statistics for gladiators according to class. Its clear that things aren't balanced. If you think otherwise you're wilfully blind.<br />
<br />
The rating reqs for armour were fine in s4, thats why you were able to get the 4/5 brutal - they're obtainable for players wearing honour gear. Are you saying that you didn't deserve your 4/5 brutal? I just don't think the 1700 rating reqs were &quot;too easy&quot; - they're about right. If someone can get a pr of 1700 they're not shit, and they deserve a reward - being stuck with s2 weap/shoulder is enough of an indication of their &quot;non-elite&quot; status. If you make it too tough to obtain for the lower end, they won't play - it still has to be fun.<br />

The &quot;epeen strokage&quot; culture in pvp is a load of shit, people need to take their rl peens outside and face their real inadequacies rather than be assholes to people online. <br />
<br />
<br />
I should have noted that I got 4/5 Brutal gear on my alt (warrior) in that short amount of time. I have 5/5 Brutal on my main (mage). But I'd always been 5/5 every arena season, so it was no big deal. I'm just making the point that this 'catch up' excuse needs to end.<br />
<br />
Holy paladins can hit 2200 in every bracket. May not be as easy as a druid to get there in 2v2, but they can still get there, and that's the point. People crying and whining about balance, when really all they want is to rollface and collect their shoulders. The game is about comps and counter comps. You'll beat team A but lose to team B. Nothing you can do about it. Just accept the loss and re-queue. As long as classes have different abilities, that's how it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
And no, a rating of 1700 doesn't mean you're good. Resto druids advertise on my server that they'll carry people to 1800 pr for the right price. And it's not wintrading, it's them legitimately winning games. So don't always think that the guy you see with the S4 helm is decent at their class.....<br />
<br />
And I don't have problem with people playing 10 games a week for arena points either. If they get the rating, then they can get the gear. What I have a problem with is the rating requirement so low, that there's not really a point in having the requirement. 1550 for S4 pants? I mean come on. What's the point of having the requirement at all if they're going to be that low.<br />
<br />
It doesn't bother me that 'bad' players are getting the gear, it really doesn't. It's just that the gear itself is so laughably easy to obtain, it defeats the purpose. And there are tonnes of people out there who just collect their 4/5 Brutal and then don't touch arena again. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Fun&quot; is an interesting point. See, for me, the whole competitive aspect of arena is what I consider fun. I don't care that I get smashed by warlocks when I'm playing my mage, it's just fun competing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Selenti</div><div class="date">2008-09-21, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rated battleground would be something that should hand out the end game pvp items. Arena should hand out blue pvp items, 2v2 and 3v3 is really too small to make decisions whether the player deserve end game gear or not. If everyone had a good loyal druid/rogue friend that would be the case, but that's not the case in the current. Certain combo's outplays so many other combos that it's not fun to compete in arena if you don't play that combo. This would be much less of an issue if rated battlegrounds were implemented and Blizzard balanced around large scale.<br />
<br />
Most recent idiotic nerfs because of arena were the racials. That wouldn't have happened if arena or smallscaled wasn't the leading PvP factor to hand out the best items. Completely fucking retarded, one of many reasons I would prefer to boycott arena in wotlk, but now I can't.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds are actually a poor way to reward individual skill, because in rated WSG for example, you can carry 3 baddies with 7 great people.<br />
<br />
You can't carry much on a 3v3.<br />
<br />
Arena is a good way to reward people, they just need to make the balance between classes more sane. I think it's interesting that people don't even pretend to be after balance anymore, they just want to obfuscate the balance with big numbers.</div></div><hr />

If high rating people keep playing week to week, then it's hard for lower rated people to go upwards. It obviously stratifies to skill/gear. Some people love this about arenas, some hate it. The difference with PvE is that if you and your buddies are capable players, you can keep progressing. PvE doesn't care that twenty other guilds have already defeated that boss.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stupid11</div><div class="date">2008-09-21, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yet another proof of my thesis that the raiding part of the WoW-community is indeed the more mature, less extreme part. This is of course only individual impression, and there ARE exceptions, but the quota of especially louth-mouted morons seems to be quite big in the Arena-section of the game.<br />
<br />
With you, the fun starts only in that last paragraph. Either you are a brilliant master of irony (and I bow to you for that!) or you are really weird enough to believe that you are one of the &quot;old gang&quot; because you've been arround since Season 1. Seriously, don't spill all over your pants there dude, its only one year out of three...<br />
Had you been arround a bit longer, though, you would have noticed obviously that High Warlord-Gear was never ment to be a season 1-addition. That, in fact, it had not been changed at all since level 60, when it was one hell of a weapon/armour-set. And dammit, it still looks hot! Yet, its nice to see you making a fool out of yourself.<br />
<br />
Now thats settled, on the rating-issue: I guess I'm kinda fine with it, since handing out top-end welfare-items over a system that doesn't include any sort of challenge or archievement, but only time, doesn't feel right. Thats why they introduced the ratings, and its not too bad an idea, neither for the pvp-elite, who can now show arround some of their accomplishments, nor for the pve-elite, who don't have to feel like spending their nights wiping all for nothing when similar weapons were obtainable through arena.<br />
<br />
But just like they did with badges-gear in PVE, they should really give us some sort of foot in the door to enter Arena lateron. For me, Arena died mid-season 3 because I simply couldn't have ANY fun anymore playing somewhat casually, with the gear difference becoming ever more important. It seems a bit unfair to me that with PvE, you get good enough gear to compete pretty easily, while with PvP, you now will be FORCED to spend a lot of time and effort only to equip yourself to a level where you are not yet a challenge, but at least not the laughable worm you are right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, wrong. I don't PVP. I raid. Got a significant number of Horde firsts on my server, never got Glad.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?items&amp;filter=na=high+warlord;minrl=70<br />
<br />
Fail more moron, take a gander at those 100 items in that search. Level 60?<br />
<br />
Nice strawman, when did I ever mention anything about an &quot;old gang?&quot; I didn't say *I* started in season 1, I just said I played in season 1 (and you admit you played until season 3 yourself, so how are you not part of the &quot;immature pvp crowd&quot; just like I am apparently?).<br />
<br />
That gear was available in season 1. For full honor. And it sucked. People made do without it. So why cry about not being able to get it because you can't get like 1500 arena points for the full set at 80?<br />
<br />
And why talk about &quot;getting a foot in the door later on&quot; now? Isn't it obvious Blizzard is going to do the same stupid &quot;season&quot; approach they did in BC? In which case, you will be able to get this &quot;leet&quot; Hateful/Deadly gear for nothing/honor. They will probably even put this shitty blue set on vendors again like they did with BC. So I fail to see how they aren't giving you that foot in the door. *This* is why I brought up season 1. All you morons forgot how it was back then, no welfare purples, no blues on vendors. But guess what, THAT CHANGED, and it WILL CHANGE AGAIN later on in Wrath. (Just like the badge gear changed.)<br />

Uh, why? So that new players can get stomped even more? And PVP-tards can think they will be even better in PVE?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calaba</div><div class="date">2008-09-21, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is how the class balancing is effected by resilience. Take a well-geared resto druid for example. Anyone tried killing one of these lately? Even if you've got really good gear yourself it's still a problem. Their lifeblooms tick away and BOOM they're back to full health. The best you can do is mana burn them down, or maybe silence / stun / fear them long enough, but this takes all day too.<br />
<br />
This has, in fact, always been the case. Anyone who's ever dueled healer vs. healer, especially Pre-TBC, will know that duels between holy pala / holy priest / resto druid have ALWAYS lasted ages. Neither could do enough DPS to kill the other, so they'd be there all day.<br />
The difference now is that healers have resilience gear, so many &quot;pure DPS classes&quot; have run into the same difficulty. And as TBC boss encounters tend to last longer, so does the healers mana pool/regen.<br />
<br />
As long as &quot;pure dps&quot; classes in blue/green gear find they can't kill well-geared healers, they'll ALWAYS demand better quality, easy-to-get gear so that they can try to nuke them more.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nubs</div><div class="date">2008-09-21, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1665 rating....harsh? LOL wtf? That's like what, 10 wins in arena?<br />
<br />
And what the hell does color of the title matter? Who gives a **** if it's blue or purple? You guys are morons.<br />
<br />
<br />
What's the best Nubs is in all S2 gear with S4 gloves, with 100 games played and ~1500 rating. ::)<br />
<br />
BUT YOU GOT EPICS BRO<br />
<br />
Guess again, better luck next time.<br />
<br />
1665 isn't 10 wins, better luck next time again.<br />
<br />
My point is that's the first item, then it's at ~1700...<br />
<br />
Here's an idea, start up WoW, look around at the people near BGs and arena battlemasters. Count the number of people with s4 helmets. By the time you can get 2 pieces of PvP gear in WotLK you can almost complete a set in BC. This isn't about GET YOUR EPICS BRO, this is about armor and stat deficit. People in PvE gear will have a huge advantage over no PR sets because the road to 1665 in shitty gear (to get one piece of gear mind you) is paved with getting your face rocked off. This is season one all over again, except with PR requirements.<br />
<br />
Now shut the hell up bro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So you increase the gear level of the opponents of bad/new players so that they need better gear to compete, thus that gives them the right to a full welfare set?<br />
<br />
Basically making it even MORE necessary to grind out a full set of gear before you/your alt can start doing arenas.<br />
<br />
Stupid idea IMO. You should LOWER the iLvl.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First change colour of PVP gear to bronze, silver and gold. We are PVPers and play matches, sports always use these colours. And this is a great way to make PVP different from PVE. PVP only needs 3 stages. In PVE you have white/grey,Green,Blue,Purple,orange 5 stages my point about the stages is that it's harder to compare PVP vs PVE if the numbers of stages is different and thats great!<br />
<br />
Then take away the arena points on the blue gear and set honor higher. It's crazy to have to do arena for blue gear, (we still don't know how much lake wintergrasp will give and so on)<br />
<br />
have rating's/arena points on silver and gold gear..<br />
