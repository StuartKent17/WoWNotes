<br />
Updated: June 14, 2016.<br />
<br />
New Transmogrification Collections System: Appearances<br />
<br />
New Collection tab: Appearances Unlock new appearances by collecting Soulbound weapons and armor your character can equip.<br />
Unlocked appearances are account-wide and usable for transmogrification by other characters that can equip the item.<br />
When first logging into a character after Patch 7.0, the appearances of appropriate items in your bags, bank, and Void Storage are learned automatically. Additional appearances will be unlocked based on previously-completed quests.<br />
Transmogrifiers located in most major cities have been improved with additional features.Got a look that you like? Save the entire transmogrification set as an outfit. Create and swap between outfits at the Transmogrifier.<br />
Additionally, transmogrifications can now be associated with your current specialization. Your outfit automatically changes when switching specializations if you so desire.<br />
Added a new option to hide shoulders.<br />
The option to hide helmets, cloaks, and shoulders has been moved into the transmogrification system.<br />
<br />
<br />
Revamped PvP Progression and Honor System<br />
<br />
Honor Points and Conquest Points have been removed as a currency.<br />
Items that were purchased using Honor or Conquest are now available for purchase with Marks of Honor that can be earned from Battlegrounds, Arenas, and Skirmishes.<br />
Learn more about upcoming PvP changes in our Legion PvP Preview (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/19994381/).<br />
<br />
<br />
Equalized PvP Gear<br />
<br />
Gear has been normalized in PvP combat. Characters entering a Skirmish Arena, Battleground, Rated Arena, Rated Battleground, or Ashran now receive an aura called Principles of War.<br />
Principles of War removes all stats gained from gear (Strength, Stamina, Haste, etc.), disables gear related bonuses (like trinket effects and set bonuses), and gives the character stats based on their specializations, and increases based on overall item level. The goal is to provide a much more finely tuned and balanced PvP experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arenas<br />
<br />
The pennant attached to the back of characters now changes its appearance based on the player’s best rating in the Arena bracket.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
Characters below level 110 winning a Battleground are now awarded Crates of Battlefield Goods. The crate contains a piece of armor appropriate for the character’s level and specialization with a chance for the crate to contain additional rewards such as weapons or relics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
<br />
Legacy<br />
<br />
Ruins of Ahn’Qiraj now resets daily instead of every 3 days.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items and Itemization<br />
<br />
Itemization<br />
<br />
In an effort to reduce the amount of gear swapping between specializations, the following changes have been made.Legion cloaks, rings, and items worn on the neck are no longer tied to a specific primary stat, and will remain relevant between specializations.<br />
Spirit and Bonus Armor have been removed.<br />
<br />
Multistrike has been removed. Items that had multistrike have had it replaced with another secondary stat.<br />
Trinkets obtained from Raids, PvP, and world drops in Warlords were overtuned and have been brought back to intended power levels.<br />
Set bonuses for item sets from expansions prior to Warlords of Draenor have been deactivated, though the text describing their former function still remains.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character Changes<br />
<br />
Specialization System Changes<br />
<br />
Characters can now change between any of their specializations at most any time for a progressive gold cost. Action bar configurations are saved for each specialization. As a result, Dual Specialization has been removed.<br />
Characters can queue up as any role that is available to their class and will automatically switch to the suitable specialization when entering the Dungeon, Raid, Battleground, or Arena without any gold cost. For example, a paladin might be questing as Retribution but queue up in Dungeon Finder as a Tank. When the paladin enters the dungeon, they will automatically switch to Protection.<br />
<br />
<br />
Updates to Combat Visuals and Audio<br />
<br />
Updated and improved on the animations, visual effects, and audio on core combat interactions like auto-attacks as well as many melee class abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talent System Changes<br />
<br />
Players are now able to switch talents while out of combat without the need for reagents.<br />
<br />
<br />
Glyph System Changes<br />
<br />
The Glyph panel has been removed from the game. Some minor glyphs that had a cosmetic effect that does not apply to a specific spell have been converted into cosmetic items that provide the same effects as before.<br />
Some minor glyphs that made cosmetic alterations to a specific spell have been added to the spell itself in the spellbook.<br />
<br />
<br />
Draenor Perks Removed<br />
<br />
Draenor Perks have been removed from the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Armor Changes<br />
<br />
Hunters and Shaman can now equip Mail armor from level 1 (down from level 40).<br />
Warriors and Paladins can now equip Plate armor from level 1 (down from level 40).<br />
New Mail and Plate reward options have been added to low level quests.<br />
<br />
<br />
Racial Abilities<br />
<br />
Human<br />
<br />
Every Man for Himself now removes all Stun effects and shares a 30-second cooldown with other items or abilities that have a similar effect.<br />
The Human Spirit has been redesigned. Human characters now gain 2% more of all secondary stats (Haste, Critical Strike, Mastery, and Versatility) from all sources.<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Changes<br />
All classes and specializations have undergone changes to abilities and mechanics. Check out our class preview logs for a better understanding on the thought process behind these changes.<br />

At the moment it is utter garbage though. They made so many adjustments over the years graphically that the whole mist you got while raining is gone. Elwynn for example when it was absolutely throwing it down had a mist in the vanilla-wrath days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The pre-expansion patch will contain things like class changes and the new transmog system. A couple of weeks after it is released, the Demon Hunters, Broken Shore event, and demon invasions will be unlocked. The demon invasions will get more intense as time goes on.<br />
<br />
This is from an interview last week so no no demon hunters at pre-patch launch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More like broken animations and some abilities not doing things 100% as described. They also have NEVER done a class on a PTR patch. If you wan't to know what they feel like as a playable class it is like having a combat / outlaw rogue mixed with a monk and a dash of old demonology warlocks but also have a free unlimited engineering glider every time they jump.</div></div><hr />

It has to be tested somehow since it's becoming available before Legion.<br />
<br />
Plus I don't care about testing it personally, I got Wardrobe stuff to test. But it seems to me if there are still DH problems, make them available on the PTR sooner rather than later.</div></div><hr />

It could I guess, it would help people get it out of their systems and let the real DH players play them lol. As we know many people don't stick with the new class and end up bailing on them over an old main so this could help with that influx we will get.</div></div><hr />

Not really. The minor glyphs (old and new) are single use, and the development path looks like there will be multiples for most spells for every class. There's also no cap on the number of glyphs that can be applied, but it can only be one per spell/ability. <br />
<br />
That, coupled with the tomes to allow talent swaps and the Vantus runes should make scribes quite useful.</div></div><hr />

They also have NEVER done a class on a PTR patch. If you wan't to know what they feel like as a playable class it is like having a combat / outlaw rogue mixed with a monk and a dash of old demonology warlocks but also have a free unlimited engineering glider every time they jump.<br />
<br />
They have also never intended to allow a class to be playable at some point in the pre patch. As we're testing the pre patch and demon hunters are coming with that (not right away, but durring) then it would make sense to test that as well. Though probably not right away.</div></div><hr />

See...I'd be inclined to believe that they have the best intentions with scribes.

I stated that. Please read before replying. Its the best way to avoid embarrassment. I think its only logical that the PTR goes through the same phases as the pre patch will on live.

There are new nameplate addons working on beta, and therefore most likely the PTR when it comes up.<br />
Not in my view as polished as Tidyplates or KUI Nameplates, but still offering options.<br />

Sigh. They are making even more boring progressing your character gearwise while leveling up. Fucking Blizzard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters can queue up as any role that is available to their class and will automatically switch to the suitable specialization when entering the Dungeon, Raid, Battleground, or Arena without any gold cost. For example, a paladin might be questing as Retribution but queue up in Dungeon Finder as a Tank. When the paladin enters the dungeon, they will automatically switch to Protection.<br />

I assume we will change back to the specialization we were in before entering the dungeon when we zone out again?<br />

I doubt Demon Hunters will be available on the PTR. If at all, then probably briefly at the end, just like on Live.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
also interested if the actual Events of the pre-patch will be available as well.<br />
<br />
They will be, but likely paced and in waves, like they will release on live. So not right away.<br />
They do plan to test the same way it would play out on live servers.<br />

Also will the Hardware Requirement for Legion take effect in this Patch? i am interested in seeing how my computer will preform.<br />

All system changes will be included of course, that includes the upgraded graphics engine, so you can test that just fine.<br />

<br />
/concur. As much as everyone is excited (and rightfully so) about Demon Hunter, there's no reason at all to put them on PTR. Trust me, the Demon Hunter starting zone has been tested quite extensively. I don't know that many beta testers have resisted the urge to try them yet.<br />
<br />
Just know this:<br />
<br />
1. The double jump and wings are just as fun as they look in the videos.<br />
2. Noobs will kill themselves repeatedly by falling off cliffs due to the mobility. (I'm including myself in this, we aren't going to discuss how I know.)<br />
3. It will be DK's everywhere all over again, but worse b/c this class is not remotely complicated to play but still fun.<br />
4. You're a demon hunter and it looks really cool when you morph into big scary tear demon faces off mode.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Why are they deactivating set bonuses before Warlords? What purpose does that serve?<br />
<br />
Old set bonuses have been abused in the past during leveling, and in some cases with new boss encounters. They're pre-emptively stopping that from occurring this time around. It's actually a smart move.</div></div><hr />

As much as everyone is excited (and rightfully so) about Demon Hunter, there's no reason at all to put them on PTR. Trust me, the Demon Hunter starting zone has been tested quite extensively. I don't know that many beta testers have resisted the urge to try them yet.<br />
<br />
Just know this:<br />
<br />
1. The double jump and wings are just as fun as they look in the videos.<br />
2. Noobs will kill themselves repeatedly by falling off cliffs due to the mobility. (I'm including myself in this, we aren't going to discuss how I know.)<br />
3. It will be DK's everywhere all over again, but worse b/c this class is not remotely complicated to play but still fun.<br />
4. You're a demon hunter and it looks really cool when you morph into big scary tear demon faces off mode.<br />
<br />

<br />
Old set bonuses have been abused in the past during leveling, and in some cases with new boss encounters. They're pre-emptively stopping that from occurring this time around. It's actually a smart move.<br />

no its not a straight +2% from all stats<br />

let's say you have 20% haste and 10% crit (for example purpose only)<br />

this passive will only put your haste to 20.4% and your crit to 10.2%, since you gain 2% more of these stats from all sources (gear, food, buffs, etc..)<br />

Yeah I meant it that way, and this (2% extra secondary stats from all sources) makes it so OP. My live mage has 70% mastery, that's +1,4% mastery alone, which makes it 0,4% better than the common +1% base increase. And it will affect all secondary stats not only one! Non-selfbuffed, non-buffed, no food... (base armory stats) bonuses for my main mage: +0,54% crit; +1,4% mastery; +0,3% haste; (+1% multistrike - retiring); +0,1% versatility. And this is OP: 1,34% additional stats compared to other race's 1% without mulitstrike, wits MS 2,34% - not logging for my real raid stats (with class buffs, food, etc.) but i guess my main could reach +5% all together, and that's five times more than any other race can get.</div></div><hr />

Lets take a deep breath. Now that it's done, lets look at it rationally.<br />
<br />
I do not think you understand how work actually works inside the industry. There is always - always - a crew available (IE: Not skeleton crew, but a full fledged team) on place in case of emergency and in case of patch. World of Warcraft is a mmo. That's its very nature.<br />
<br />
Also, yes, stability has everything to do with it. All they need to validate at that point is that it's not filled with bugs and is stable.<br />
<br />
You really need to learn more about the industry, friend. And about your game; for instance, 4.2 was released June 28th. 6.2 on June 22nd.</div></div><hr />

2 things before we get too negative.<br />
<br />
First: It had Factual errors that needed to be corrected to be correct with current build data.<br />
<br />
Second: Those are released when the PTR comes up or right around it. It even says on it &quot;THE PTR FOR 7.0 IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE&quot; It was obviously meant to be posted when it was available. The previous PTR build hadn't even came down yet that's why they took it down. I highly doubt we have days. More like hours.<br />

<br />
none the less, it clearly states &quot;shares a 30-second cooldown with other items or abilities that have a similar effect.&quot; - that implies it shares a cooldown with the PVP ability. That would make it a dead ability, if the PVP ability removes all loss of control effects, why would you ever use the human racial over the PVP ability if it shares a cooldown.<br />

It's considered 7.0 for a reason. Every pre-patch has essentially been the new expansion minus all the features that involve the new areas and leveling past previous expansion max level. The client always changes to the next expansion's launcher too even though the expansion isn't launched yet.</div></div><hr />

The PTR prepatch, and the prepatch itself will include zero Legion content apart from class changes and systems. Legion content comes with Legion. You will be level 100 on PTR.

I think they're saying that the Legion stuff will be there, and just not accessible. Beta's current build is 7.0.3.21916; this PTR build is after that - so it has everything beta has, and then some. You just can't get to it all during the &quot;pre-patch&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I've never tried the PTR before, how does installing it work? Can I patch a live installation to the PTR, or does it need to download the whole game again?<br />

PTR is its own thing bro, you need to download the whole game again..</div></div><hr />

<br />
The nice thing about the PTR is that you don't need to install the entire thing, (if you don't want too). Just go into your WoW folder for Live, and copy the 'Data' folder. After that, start the install process for the PTR. When it gets to the point where it starts to actually download stuff (this will show you remaining GBs), completely close your Battlenet launcher. Paste the Live Data folder into the newly created PTR folder, after the copying gets done, go back into the battlenet launcher. You won't have to install the PTR now, (maybe only a very small amount). for me, I didnt have to install anything, it was just ready to go. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
<br />
Though, I do have to install 20 gigs haha. Which didnt happen on my laptop earlier today, so it must be 7.0. Still, more digestible by copying files over! :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snackfeat</div><div class="date">2016-06-15, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">none the less, it clearly states &quot;shares a 30-second cooldown with other items or abilities that have a similar effect.&quot; - that implies it shares a cooldown with the PVP ability. That would make it a dead ability, if the PVP ability removes all loss of control effects, why would you ever use the human racial over the PVP ability if it shares a cooldown.<br />
<br />
Or has Blizzard confirmed somewhere it will not share a cooldown with the PVP ability?<br />
<br />
It's the exact same as will of the forsaken, but removing stuns instead of fears. Is will of the forsaken a dead ability?<br />
<br />
Sharing a 30 second cooldown doesn't mean you can only ever use one of them, it means you can use your normal pvp trinket to remove whatever cc, and then be able to remove a stun 30 seconds later, and still have your normal pvp trinket ready again 1 min 30 sec after that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roncero</div><div class="date">2016-06-15, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you're banking on only being stunned in PVP? that's being quite optimistic.<br />
<br />
You get both abilities though. Having a regular pvp trinket (its not a trinket anymore but whatever) plus the new human racial is more powerful than having just the old human racial, even more so as damage trinkets don't work in instanced pvp in Legion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A heal left can you change to Holy? No sorry I dont have gold.<br />
Would you like to tank this expansion? No, having to pay for changing during months will be a lot of gold, I will stay dps.<br />
Can you go fire for AOE dmg in this boss? No sry I never payed to set up another spec.<br />
<br />
It might not happen in mythic environrments. But while pugging and playing normal or heroic... It will happen a lot. They are creating a problem where there is none actually.</div></div><hr />

was standing out front of org cos the broken shore quest (where u enter the instance) cant be completed just dueling and switching between all the specs.<br />

Players may now change talents freely when in any rested XP area. The Inscription profession can craft consumable items that allow for this to be done in the field. In addition, after queuing into an instanced dungeon, raid, or PvP content, players have a grace period during which they may change talents freely.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh my god....... Please stop that ! Why do that ? Let us change talents freely all the time, a restriction of area is soooooooooooooo boring or we back at Legacy ? This system is to much boring and it's just a very BAD idea omg.<br />
Can you listen your community please ? Stop that idea, delete it. And i'm not the only one who think that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ultimately, I'm interested in two things:<br />
<br />
1) How much bag space am I really saving?<br />
2) How fluid is melee combat with the new animations?<br />
<br />
I also want to find out what the gold cost really is for changing specializations. I'm especially interested in the fact that if I'm questing as Elemental, for example, and get queued as a healer, do I just get the gold taken away from me for a respec when zoning in (as it happens automatically)?<br />
<br />
Not much else interests me all that much. I might mess about with some specs I don't have at max level to see how they play, but I'm not going to spoil anything prior to actual release.</div></div><hr />

You can copy your live folder and rename it &quot;World of Warcraft Public Test&quot; so you only have to download a 20GB or so patch.</div></div><hr />

I understand why they wouldn't have Demon Hunters as early as the pre-patch starts, but your reasoning is invalid. They've been a thing for almost a year now, and looking at beta footage, they are not too buggy to play. The biggest thing I've seen from all of the footage is the recent spell effect that causes huge black polygons everywhere from demon form. What difference would 2-4 weeks make for bugginess?</div></div><hr />
