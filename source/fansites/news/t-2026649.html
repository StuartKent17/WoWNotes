Everything has had damage reduced, apart from the classes that drastically needed improvements.<br />
<br />
One thing that's confusing me though is this..<br />
Hungering Rune Weapon Empower your rune weapon, gaining 1 rune and 5 Runic Power instantly and every 1.5 sec for 12 sec. Frost Death Knight - Level 58 Talent. Instant. 3 min cooldown. 1 sec cooldown.<br />
<br />
I assume this is wrong, but a 3 minute cooldown to a 1 second cooldown? O_o<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Don't just look at 'your class' and assume it was the only one that had some negative changes guys.. Almost everythings damage was reduced substantially.</div></div><hr />

I would normally agree with you, but the nerfs other classes get would bring them down to the paladin level damage wise. So by nerfing everyone and then nerfing paladins further is just ugh.</div></div><hr />

You have to have the cloak for the achieve. If you don't have the cloak you're RIP as far as I know. Technically it can still be obtained, but you must have the cloak, so it's not an achieve you can get points for - for everyone (new folks/people who didn't gaf about the cloak).</div></div><hr />

They said several weeks ago that it is going to be removed in Legion.<br />

<br />
<br />
Is the cat form change really that big a deal - you can change to any spec at any time, so just change to feral if you want cat form.<br />

<br />
Yeah, it is. Druids should be able to shapeshift to all different forms.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiberria</div><div class="date">2016-07-13, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the cat form change really that big a deal - you can change to any spec at any time, so just change to feral if you want cat form.<br />
<br />
Yes - Cat Form also gives you +30% movement speed, and is a huge boost to moving around, running through old instances, or running back after wipes when Dash and Displacer Beast are on CD. Think of it kind of like Ghost Wolf for Druids. Losing that would be a huge quality of life/enjoyment of spec hit to every other spec. Not only that, but as long as Feral Affinity exists as a talent, you still need to have it available when you take that talent. It wasn't added to Feral Affinity, which makes me think it's a datamining error.<br />
<br />
Edit - plus the Displacer Beast talent expressly puts you in Cat Form and exists for all specs. How can it be removed as an ability with these talents still existing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to assume you've never played Druid or have ever seen someone play Druid, having cat form on a non feral spec is extremely useful for mobility and will save your life in many situations and removing that option is huge and you can't change spec mid fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it has stealth, a stun from said stealth, a bleed rogues can't remove with cloak, and a passive movement increase rolled into one. Maybe they considered it too much utility for the other specs, it's a lot to lose but it may simple be fair.</div></div><hr />

The only thing im wondering about is the Alchemy stuff...<br />
Ancient Healing Potion No longer requires the Dalaran Alchemy Station. <br />
Alchemy. 2 sec cast. <br />
Reagents: Yseralline Seed x4, Yseralline Seed.<br />
<br />
So you need 5x Yseralline Seed?</div></div><hr />

The sad part is that these people often perceive their vents will be listened to over constructive critiques because they're louder. :D<br />

Wait what? I didn't see that. Don't understand why they would make that change. It was actually a pretty fun run through as it was.</div></div><hr />

Unless I missed another pass of nerfs, I don't know what raids you've been in but I've seen DH's holding 400k &amp; approaching 500k on fights. It looked like I had temporarily ported back to MoP except my recount was almost solid purple.</div></div><hr />

Because if you read the top of the first post that was edited it says everything in that list is wrong and was because of how player level scaling works. That's why there is another post above it on the home page.</div></div><hr />

Sorry Boss Nerraw, the cloak is still required for the achieve - if you have the cloak on one of your characters, Blizzard opened up the killing of ordos if you have the cloak on at least one character. But at least the ACTUAL achieve/loot requires you to have the cloak somewhere on your bnet account.</div></div><hr />
