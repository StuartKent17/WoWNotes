<br />
That's one way to look at it. Although, if I remember correctly, WoD only had something like 3M sold in the first week while subs were reported at 10M. Might not be the best way to gauge subs...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well aslo I forgot but WoD and Cata sold the same amount opening week and Cata had 2m more players so.. I still think Subs are around 8-11m. Id guess 9m, but they did say they havent seen these numbers in years so its possible they are above 10m.<br />

<br />
Yeah but they said they hadnt seen numbers like this in a long time. I read into that as before WoD, and MoP and WoD launched with the same numbers so if that statement is true, and if he is talking about subs, then subs are above 10m. Either way its a pretty successful launch.</div></div><hr />

Since they don't report sub numbers anymore, we gotta rely on remarks like the one where they say numbers have been higher then in many years, and also things like the infographic about the pre patch where they said people rolled 3.9m Demon hunters---which means that the amount of people who preordered had to be higher then that (since statistically not everyone rolled one right away).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The last sub report we heard was around 5.5M, and that's likely where it stayed for WoD. With the pre-patch bounce and the release bounce, I could easily imagine it at 10M again.</div></div><hr />

Lots of people wanted that during WoD. I would have LOVED it in WoD, cause then I could log on and do raids and mythics and all that and just do the garrison missions from my phone.<br />

Doesn't really matter, because you can't do more than 1 DH in one realm, and i don't think the minimum amount of people who created one on multiple realms matters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably not a really signifigant amount to dramatically cut the numbers. How many people do you know who really keep up on 3 realms let alone 5? Those guys are in the minority at best. Even if we say that everyone rolled 2 DH to get both choices of follower, that still makes it 2m preorders and thats assuming that every preorder made their pair of DH in time for the infographic to be made--statistically not the case.</div></div><hr />

I honestly don't think we will ever see level scaling beyond content of the current expansion. So Legion will always only scale to 110, the next expac will always only scale to say 120, and so on. I really don't see them implementing it into older content, because the man hours needed to fix the problems like overcrowding of mobs would take quite a chunk of time. You mention the murlocs, and that's a good example because simply looking at a level 8 quest in Elwynn you are sent to kill murlocs for something and you generally end up aggroing 5-6 at a time without trying. For worldwide level scaling to work, each of these would have to be addressed on a case by case basis, otherwise the mobs in question will be vastly overpowered or underpowered.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry. Final Fantasy XIV had a dungeon two patches back that was entirely upside down. It didn't cause a problem.<br />

Speaking of which. In FFXIV every hard mode version of a previous dungeon gets entirely new areas, loot and enemies. With the old one remaining for leveling of course.

So they can use the whole continent for the expansion pack and not just tiny designated 110 areas.</div></div><hr />

What a TERRIBLE MISTAKE that would be ! People who want that are stupid and ignorant, that would mean EVERY ennemy in the whole world would everytime be at YOUR level, you will not be able to visit zones anymore because of multiple aggro, you can't farm old mats because of the lv max ennemies everywhere, do you remember the murlocs?

Hate it but agree with comment above about scaling to max level in expansion and not further being the only real option for scaling. A key part of RPGs is getting so much better than opponents that they are trivial to you. It's a power thing. It may not be everyone but I would imagine there are still a lot of people that like running old content when max level (for mounts mostly but also transmog and achievements, and of course revenge on that boss that kept killing you)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's not a stupid idea if done correctly. I bet the only way they would do that would be lock the max level of the zone per expansion.<br />
That would be like, Vanilla zones (excluding Cataclysm zones, ofc) would lock at level 60, BC zones locks at 70 and so on. With that, there wouldn't be difference about farming on max level on anything, because when like, you return to Hellfire Peninsula at max level, mobs would be at 70, Borean Tundra at 80, etc. That also counts towards dungeons, and raids would still be the same.<br />
<br />
Zone scalling is fantastic, and it wound't &quot;kill the concept of RPG&quot;, it would make it better. Everyone could level anywhere they wanted, and you wouldn't be tied to a zone because of your level, but the only way they could do this right is doing as I said, and I doubt they would do anything different than that.</div></div><hr />

Relevant? Do you even know what it means? No game is ever relevant to anything important. So why is WoW relevant and HALO not? It makes no sense, it's just a dumb thing to say when you have no actual arguments. As is dismissing other people's wishes by calling them stupid.</div></div><hr />

There is tons of challenging content within Mythic+ and Raids so I don't really understand your argument here. Questing is supposed to be a cooperative and enjoyable experience for the majority of players, it's not an area of the game tailored to the few hardcore players who are looking to really test themselves. End-game content will fill that void for you, as it should.</div></div><hr />

They already stated that it will work similar to WoD where you complete the Pathfinder achievement to unlock flying in Legion. The first part is already ingame and gives you increased mount speed on the ground as a reward (See the Legion tab under the Exploration achievements). Further parts of the achievement will be added in future patches.<br />
I guess we will get flying in 7.2 or 7.3 depending on how far they spread out content patches.</div></div><hr />

What's it matter if the NPC's are the same level as you? Now people have a reason to go back and see the whole continent instead of a single zone. Once you get better gear it won't even matter if they are still 110 like you because you'll still be able to kill them quick.<br />

No it is the opposite...it is adding content. Now an entire continent remains relevant instead of everyone being funneled into a single zone the whole x-pac. With world quests and the way the story is setup we will always have a reason to go everywhere. I can't believe their are people here that like the old way of questing where everything becomes obsolete and 5 out of the 6 zones you never have a reason to go back to ever again except to farm some mats.....yay....<br />

<br />
That's what gear is for. You can already kick the crap out of most 110 NPC's already. With raid gear and even later tier raid gear you will easily be able to kill 110's that may give you some difficulty now. How many times do you think people go back to old zones just to 1 shot NPC's because they can? You literally get nothing out of it...no power progression....no reason to even be there. Now you have a reason to be there and you will get stronger as time goes on. Think outside the box.<br />

<br />
They might have the same technique, but how they are used is different. True, you need them for some of the class quests. Also they can give you gold. But you have less missions, less minions in there and some additional functions.<br />
<br />
Biggest Problem with the garrison system was, that it gave you too much of all and you didn't need to go &quot;outside&quot; to farm your stuff. This won't happen in legion. The garrison missions were meant as a mini game, but they overdid it by a large margin.<br />
<br />
Right now it looks they got the right balance between too much and too low. It's a nice option for alts or causal player with low time, to get some artefact power etc. without breaking the game again like in wod. Also with the smartphone app, you can plan ahead what would be the best to do in the evening, if you are bored in transit or so.<br />
