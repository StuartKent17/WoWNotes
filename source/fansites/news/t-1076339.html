WoW Raid Design<br />
Some solid, constructive feedback and observations have been offered in this thread. But I think it’s important to point out that it’s incorrect to assume that there has been reduced development time put into raids. <br />
<br />
If anything, over the years we’ve put increased attention into raids so that a wider breadth of players can experience them. There are a great deal more options for pursuing raiding now than say, in classic World of Warcraft or The Burning Crusade, when raid groups were a fixed size and only one difficulty setting existed. We realize that some players prefer to run with 24 other comrades-in-arms at the max difficulty setting (I’m actually one of them ), whereas others prefer more intimate raids or a lower difficulty setting. <br />
<br />
In Mists of Pandaria, we plan to be able to continue to support a wide variety of raiding styles. And, from one player to another, if you’re eager for raid zones with an “epic” feel, you’re going to really enjoy some of the stuff we have in store. We’ll have some further details on that front coming up in the near future, but know that we really do appreciate your passion for the game and your continued feedback. We are listening. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216845-the-future-of-wow-raids/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3881924701?page=13#259))<br />
<br />
Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator<br />
The intent of the talent calculator was to give players something to fool around with. We wanted everyone to get a feel for the idea we're going for in Mists so that it wouldn't sound as crazy or shocking when seen on &quot;paper.&quot; <br />
<br />
We've responded many times about talent calculator feedback, even pointing out we're not going to be able to discuss things point by point with players because the systems are rapidly changing while in development. The calculator itself is quite out of date.<br />
<br />
So you're right. I took the time to respond to this thread when I could've responded elsewhere. But what did I say? I basically said things are looking awesome so far and I can't wait to be able to share more information.<br />
<br />
Would you feel better if I found a thesis from you about the problems you have with the out-of-date Mists talent calculator for rogues, only to say, &quot;A lot of the details you're discussing aren't fully fleshed out yet, so we'll talk again when we have updated Mists class info to provide&quot;? Even if you think the answer to that is &quot;yes,&quot; I wouldn't be surprised if you then came back here in two weeks to tell me how many amazing threads there are out there about the &quot;REAL&quot; issues that are going completely ignored. It's a neverending cycle and I'm not interesting in always looking for the squeakiest wheels to grease on the forums.<br />
<br />
The only inevitability in community management I've found is that, whenever we post ANYWHERE on the forums, someone will be sure to tell us where we should be posting, and which part of the community is really being ignored.

<br />
Have checked the exchange rates, the disparity is huge right now, though I must admit that current &quot;content-draught&quot; and a new shiny around people are probably losing interest in additon, Blizzard being tolerant on annual pass cancellation backfiring on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because you spent the first month or so of the content patch becoming attuned to the actual raid through OTHER raids, and complicated boss mechanics were instead provided by walls of damage. <br />

I don't have a lick of flexibility in my talent tree as of now. There is a &quot;best build&quot; and anything beyond that is either very, very marginally situational or almost completely useless.</div></div><hr />

Didn't NA get a sale a while ago? I remember my dad got BC and Wrath for like $10 each for his RaF account and the pets were $5 each as well, this was maybe 2-3 months ago though..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah there was a Christmas sale. I thought the previous xpacs were super cheap at the moment too.<br />
And having a sale 2 months ago is a reasonable length of time. If we were having sales every week they wouldn't be special sales, now would that.<br />
<br />
EDIT: The 7th Anniversary discount is only for Europe (at the moment?) which is 50% off.<br />
The Xmas sales was for 75% in North America/Oceanic compared to the Xmas sale for Europe which was 30%.<br />
So we might have missed out on the Anniversary discount, but our Xmas discount was huge compared to theirs.<br />
<br />

<br />
I also don't know why people are all, &quot;wah we don't have enough flexibility in our spec decisions&quot;.<br />
It's like, dude, even when we have 51 point talent trees, there was always going to be the &quot;right&quot; way (max dps for you min/maxers), the &quot;okay&quot; way (where you could slot in fun talents or pvp talents with minimal DPS loss), and the &quot;wtf are you even doing&quot; way. Or the absolutely soul-suckingly OP way (helloooooo SL/SL Warlocks).<br />
For once in MoP I can go &quot;yeah I want to play Destruction, but have my health regen like that, a cool CD to pop (or COOL DEMONS), and my defensive CD to act in that way. <br />
Or for DKs, I can finally have Runic Corruption instead of Runic Empowerment as Frost. Those who prefer RNG to predictability (sort of like trinket procs really) can have what they want.<br />
<br />

<br />
This. For the love of God, I wish people would listen to the blues, who have repeated it multiple times and whom are always right. There is no choice. There is the illusion of choice, because there are a lot more talent points. However, those 41 talent points MUST be spent in specific places, else you're doing it wrong. You have two, maybe three points put aside for a miniscule change that doesn't tend to affect the overall playstyle of a build or affect you meaningfully in any way. The other 31 points are, usually, reserved for a build that you've just researched or looked up on EJ. And as I said, if you just put them wherever you want, you're not going to be as well-off as you would've been if you'd put them in these pre-selected places. Why people can't seem to wrap their head around this very simple and obvious fact is beyond me.<br />
<br />
You can have 41 talent points. But if you're forced to put them in specific places anyway, why the Hell are people whining about it? At least these six can be fun and you'll be able to spend them however you want in a way that will actually affect your character on an individual level or playstyle-based level. So instead of being Unholy DK #239 EJ Spec 1, you'll be Unholy Dk #239 with Runic Empowerment (lol), Grasp of Gorefiend or a Freeze, one of three different life-rejuvenating spells and other stuff. That, to me, makes for a more interesting choice.<br />
<br />
41 talent-points that I'm having to put into specific places the moment I hit level 10 and 11, however, are not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the better choices would be talents that added flavor to your toon. not DPS or survivability. like spell effect and such. and give players 1 every level. that way peeps could actually be different.<br />
<br />
If talents were done right they would not effect play at all they would just add uniqueness to your character. This is a role playing game after all. allow people to actually be unique individuals. <br />
<br />
give you the ability to change colors of spell effects, the animation of the effects. or actually change things like a fireball to an acid ball or some such. it wouldn't change the damage it causes, but would make it possible to be fairly unique within the game.</div></div><hr />

**3 Am is not always the best time to put ideas in text, stuff might sound wierd as english is not my native language.**<br />
<br />
WTB more H-Ragnaros-like Heroic only phases. It gives more motivation to push to see the end of it. Maybe not Rag's level of complexity at each boss, but something more than just &quot;another add on Yor'shaj's same fight&quot;, tough it makes the absorbed-adds phase really challenging. I'd like so see more changes than that. ie. Compared to Normal Morchok, HMorchok is a nice change.<br />
<br />
Also I'd like to see more of a difference between LFR and Normal mode. I'd like to think of LFR more like a trailer to the real deal than just an idiot-proof version. ie. : compared to LFR Morchok, Normal Morchok is the same thing with bigger numbers, meh.<br />
<br />
Gating content for LFR is also something i'd like to see. People would gear up slower, raiders would not have to run the whole thing just to get tier 4p set bonuses with lower iLvl. I know, &quot;Fall of DW was not avilable the 1st week, derp&quot; But since week 2 everyone with random loot in their bags can go headbutt DW to death even if they just jump in the maelstrom at the start of the fight (truestory.jpg). Unlocking 2 bosses a week if you have only 8 bosses would be a little help to slow down the burned-out feeling every raider is already feeling, or will feel as we approach MoP Beta.<br />
<br />
We had a year of ICC, but we did not see Arthas on week 2. Now we have still quite a few months of Dragon soul to do but he's dead since week 2 and there's less bosses to get to him. People not wanting to dedicate the necessary time for heroic modes are already out of content to do. I understand Blizzard wants raids to be seen by more of the player base, hence LFR. But even normal DS is really easy for the most part, Ultraxion being sort of a gear check.<br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR : Blizz need to make it more interesting to progress to higher difficulties by adding DISTINCTIVE stuff in each boss/difficulty if they want to have less-but-better bosses like they wanted for FL/DS.</div></div><hr />

But I think it’s important to point out that it’s incorrect to assume that there has been reduced development time put into raids.<br />
<br />
If anything, over the years we’ve put increased attention into raids'<br />
<br />
Buy a car, its awesome its cool. You love the design, feel and quality of it and the company has clearly put in the time. <br />
<br />
Then the company starts adding things like cup holders, sat navs and other bits n bobs that are nice but aren't really needed. The car becomes less reliable but more fun to look at as the company is spending more time on 'shiny' items that have short term appeal and spending less time on the cars design.<br />
<br />
This car is still the best on the market by a great deal, the company knows this but continue release an inferior product because they know people won't go to 2nd &amp; 3rd place and no one can really do much about it or at least is willing to.<br />
<br />
Basically that's wow imo, 'Some solid, constructive feedback and observations have been offered in this thread' - but they continue to ignore the blatant issues within the game.<br />
'If anything, over the years we’ve put increased attention into raids' -You put time into raids.. you mean some for example firelands wasn't a raid of weak bosses and 1 top notch one.. until they nerfed all this effort they put into it.<br />
<br />
'There are a great deal more options for pursuing raiding'... as per my analogy, they spend more time on options than actual content life. It's get it out there to the players full of bugs and then nerf it fast. <br />
<br />
'In Mists of Pandaria, we plan to'.. yeah yeah yeah.. we've heard it all before. This will be fixed, that will be done.. gona be awesome. Blizzards track record is proving otherwise at great pace. <br />
<br />
'And now, in honor of World of Warcraft’s Seventh Anniversary in Europe, we’re offering the biggest discount ever' - Reducing previous exp prices to try grab some more people into the game because they lost so many customers due to half asses content.<br />
<br />
They can word it anyway they want and say how much effort is being put in, but I guess they believe everyone is a blind fanboi with no opinion of their own and will just nod to everything they say and do.<br />
<br />
The old saying of actions speak louder than words applies so much here.</div></div><hr />

Like so many people, just because it was in the winning team doesn't mean the class is le pro in pvp. Learning curve/skill for a hunter at that level is quite different from other classes.<br />
It's 'funny' because you don't see many hunter#s at that level.. and one match doesnt sum up all classes involved performances in it in pvp.</div></div><hr />

Like...there's a reason the Mage was being trained.<br />
<br />
You must not arena much, do ya :P? Before I go on this rant, bear in mind I'm assuming you're talking about the RMP vs PHD. <br />
<br />
The reason you see what's happening in this video is because the only options an RMP has is to go on the DK or the Paladin. The opener on their paladin was beautiful and to be honest, probably should've netted them the kill but they decide not to risk going all in, so they let the pally get away and swapped DK. A good hunter, and especially with these guys who had an amazing one (Braindeadly), will give the rogue next to no uptime on him while pumping out immense damage. So the situation you would see is - rogue trying to get on hunter, hunter kiting him around and limiting damage, mage trying to poke out of the pillar and getting railed by the hunter, and letting the DK do whatever he pleases because the Paladin would be un-CCable outside of DF/Impact/Ring. <br />
<br />
Basically, the RMP played it correctly. PHD just does a TON of damage to mages. I've played ATC, KFC, PHD in the past and we're always amazing against mages. When we see one, we get VERY happy. The matches in NAO are great and I fully support them. I hope more and more people watch each week so we can make this bigger than any Blizzard sponsored tournament. Maybe it will make them see what a poor job they're doing and actually care about the PvP community.<br />

I stopped the viedo at &quot;Aura mastery used by the priest.&quot; :D<br />
<br />
Reeaaallllyyyy hope that's a joke -.-. Everyone, or at least a lot, of people call it Aura Mastery. I've been playing my priest as my main PvP character for a little over a year now and I refer to it as Aura Mastery because it's essentially the same effect and AM was the first of it's kind, also the fact that I played a paladin main for many years before this. I believe the person who called it Aura Mastery was Azael. If you don't know who Azael is, then... well... I guess it makes sense why you stopped the video :P.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raiders don't HAVE to run it, the LFR is for people who can't do normals/Heroics for whatever reason. Be it time, lack of guild or lack of good skill. I don't feel people should be gate out of the LFR, if raiders are running it and burning them selves out its their problem no one elses. What WOULD be good is to add a feature that locks people out if they have heroic or normal raid gear on from DS. They obviously have no reason even being in the LFR to start with, and I have seen many people IN the LFR with full normal DS gear on rolling on items like they could use them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, I just can't not comment on a PvP comment! So I decided to review the games to see what you were talking about and honestly I don't see what you're getting at. The first Blind was on the Hunter during the second match on RoV - why would he blow vanish/waste dance time walking all the way over to the hunter when they're doing damage and actually connecting on the Paladin. Imo, that was the right move. The second Blind came during the third game on Dalaran Sewers and it was again on the hunter - again I say, why would he waste time walking over there? Especially on Dalaran Sewers when his team was around the boxes anyways (hunters greatest weakness = LoS). Bear in mind he also had to peel the DK off their mage which is exactly what he was doing. <br />
<br />
As far as the Fears and Leap of Faiths go, I never saw a need for Leap of Faith. The only person he would possibly need to grip is the Mage and they were sitting next to each other on every map anyways, so that's a moot point. I'll have to agree with you on the Fears though, I don't feel like rewatching the whole thing yet another time but I did skim through it and I didn't see very many fears. I, as a priest, can somewhat understand this as fighting a PHD when there's a mage on your team almost all your globals NEED to go into healing or else he splats. <br />
<br />
You also have to remember that It's almost next to IMPOSSIBLE to fear a good paladin especially with a hunter/DK. Between Concussive Shot, Paladin Sprint, HoJ (outranges fear), Scatter, Silencing Shot, Monkey Stun, Strangulate, Chains of Ice, and Death Grip.... yeah. By the time you reach the paladin for a fear, your mage is 20% and in an Ice Block. Fear the DPS? Gets dispelled immediately and buys you maybe an extra global at best. <br />
<br />
The priest in that RMP is just some no named priest though (at least to me) so of course his play wasn't top notch. I can point out just as many mistakes. The RMP didn't do too poorly, I liked the mages play. I just wanted to correct you on some things that weren't true. You make it sound like they made game breaking mistakes and were the worst RMP in the world. Hunters absolutely rail Mages, then you have the added annoyance of a DK. RMP struggles with PHD, you need to play flawlessly to beat them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Highest rating achieved? I'm just curious (not bashing or anything). It's just interesting you make the rogue eat traps and not the mage. Also like I said, while they did make a lot of mistakes, they didn't play horribly. You have to remember PHD causes a lot of pressure and they did an alright job. I will agree that the priest wasn't anything special, but it wasn't as horrible as you say.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brazinger</div><div class="date">2012-02-06, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If anything, over the years we’ve put increased attention into raids so that a wider breadth of players can experience them. There are a great deal more options for pursuing raiding now than say, in classic World of Warcraft or The Burning Crusade, when raid groups were a fixed size and only one difficulty setting existed.<br />
<br />
Ah yes, the horrible, dark days of Vanilla and The Burning Crusade where raid content didn't become out-dated and pointless with each patch, and on the whole remained challenging throughout the expansion whatever gear one wore.<br />
<br />
And, from one player to another, if you’re eager for raid zones with an “epic” feel, you’re going to really enjoy some of the stuff we have in store.<br />
<br />
This really is the worst kind of Deja vu; how many times have we heard this? Didn't they say the same about &quot;epic&quot; gear this expansion?<br />
<br />
The intent of the talent calculator was to give players something to fool around with. We wanted everyone to get a feel for the idea we're going for in Mists so that it wouldn't sound as crazy or shocking when seen on &quot;paper.&quot; <br />
<br />
All these dumbed-down talent calculators have brought us is less and less flexibility concerning our talents. There's no longer any room to fool around on the whole.<br />
<br />
There's MUCH more flexibility in the new talent trees than there are now...</div></div><hr />
