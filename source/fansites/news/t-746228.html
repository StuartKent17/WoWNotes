Cataclysm Preview: Southern Barrens<br />
<br />
For our ongoing coverage of World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, we recently sat down with game designers Dave Kosak and Roman Marotte to ask them about the work they've done on the Southern Barrens, a once-familiar place drastically altered by Deathwing's return and the continuing struggle between the Horde and the Alliance.<br />
<br />
Q. What was the original concept for the zone?<br />
A. The Barrens is one of the areas of Kalimdor hardest-hit by the Cataclysm. It has literally been ripped in two! The Northern Barrens retains much of the feel of the original zone and fulfills a similar gameplay purpose: it's primarily a training ground for low-level Horde characters. That gave us enormous freedom to create a whole new gameplay experience for the Southern Barrens. In the wake of the Cataclysm, the Alliance has been aggressively expanding into the heart of the continent from the east coast. As players enter the zone, they'll find that the Horde is really up against the ropes. The escalating conflict between the two rival factions is front and center here, providing a backdrop for much of the area's quests.<br />
<br />
Q. Who will be using this zone (what levels/factions)?<br />
A. The Southern Barrens is geared toward Alliance and Horde characters from levels 30â€“35.<br />
<br />
Q. Without giving up any spoilers, what's the general storyline for this zone? How has it changed from the original design?<br />
A. &quot;An eye for an eye&quot; is the theme, with each side taking and losing ground, descending deeper and deeper into violent conflict. From the Horde perspective, players will learn the grim fate of Camp Taurajo and Honor's Stand. It's then up to the players to rally their faction's disorganized forces, initiate a change in local leadership, and avenge the sacking of Taurajo. The Alliance, meanwhile, struggles to hold on to recent gains, fending off attacks from all fronts. Players will also fight to save Northwatch Hold from the brink of capture and keep the roadways from Theramore open. Additionally, both factions have to deal with the explosive growth of a strange new jungle spreading across the Barrens. This is all entirely new content for the expansion.<br />
<br />
Q. What do you think is the most exciting new addition to or feature of the zone?<br />
A. Definitely the Alliance/Horde conflict, which really comes alive in the Southern Barrens. We tried to give players the feeling of participating in large PvP-style conflicts, even if they're playing solo. Alliance and Horde members will struggle to capture and defend key points of the battlefield against waves of enemy troops. New technology will allow players to experience the story in ways they never could have prior to Cataclysm. For example, the Horde assault on the fortress at Bael Modan, and its aftermath, should really pull players into the action by showing dramatic changes in the world.<br />
<br />
Also, one word: Mankrik.<br />
<br />
Q. What goes into redesigning a zone like this?<br />
A. The Southern Barrens was a complete rework, so we really started from scratch, identifying the key areas of contention and then building a short storyline around each one. To accentuate the conflict, battles continually rage in hot spots around the zone. Finally, we put together a quest structure that throws players into the thick of those engagements. We invested a lot of effort into infusing the right emotions into the zone. If you're a Horde player, for instance, we want you to be completely outraged by what happened at Taurajo!<br />
<br />
Q. So what has happened at Camp Taurajo? It appears to be in ruins.<br />
A. That depends on whom you ask! Alliance players can speak to General Hawthorne at Forward Command and discover his reasoning for removing Taurajo from the Horde arsenal. On the other hand, if you speak to the various Horde leaders at Hunter's Hill, Camp Una'fe, or Vendetta Point, you'll hear a very different version of events. We suspect that debate over the ethics of this one will rage for some time.<br />
<br />
Q. What was the most challenging aspect about implementing so many changes to an existing zone?<br />
A. It was a real challenge getting the story to flow organically from the start of the zone to the climax. Key NPCs move around and are killed during the fighting; that's always tricky to pull off.<br />
<br />
Q. What should players do or go see first?<br />
A. Alliance players will definitely want to get to Northwatch Hold as soon as possible: it's about to fall to the Horde! Likewise, Horde players should check out the utter devastation at Taurajo. Someone... has got... to pay.<br />
<br />
Q. Why is the Great Gate barring entry to and from the Barrens and Mulgore?<br />
A. The Horde built the Great Gate in reaction to Alliance aggression from Dustwallow Marsh, including the construction of a highway running from Theramore straight to the Barrens. The gate was finished just in time: Alliance forces had penetrated all the way to the entrance of Mulgore, and the gate slowed them down long enough for the Horde to rally and launch a counterattack (with the player's help, of course!).<br />
<br />
Q. Will you explain a bit about the emergence of the Overgrowth and the new Horde Camp Una'fe?<br />
A. Players may be familiar with the story of Naralex, the ambitious druid who tried to reinvigorate the springs of the Wailing Caverns to return the Barrens to the lush expanse that it once was. His story continues in the Southern Barrens as he tries to contain and cope with the unintended consequences of his near-fatal exposure to the Emerald Nightmare. The uncontrolled growth in this part of the Barrens threatens the Alliance and the Horde alike. Teegan's Expedition in the east is stymied in its attempts to get Alliance supplies to the front, while at Camp Una'fe to the west, Taurajo's survivors find themselves overwhelmed as well.<br />
<br />
Q. What are the Alliance forces at Forward Command and Fort Triumph and the Horde forces at Desolation Hold hoping to accomplish in the Southern Barrens by vying for control of the Battlescar?<br />
A. Geography defines the conflict here. The Battlescar sits in the middle of a narrow pass, a natural bottleneck. The Alliance needs to blast its way through here in order to maintain an overland link between Theramore and Northwatch Hold, not to mention a route into the Stonetalon Mountains, where the Alliance can lend aid to its allies. If the Horde can seal off this pass, then Theramore will essentially be isolated. The conflict comes to a head in the Battlescar... and the future of Kalimdor may hinge on the outcome.<br />
<br />
Thank you, gentlemen, for taking the time to discuss the work you've done to breathe new life and adventure into the Southern Barrens for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm!<br />

AE Tanking skills cooldown<br />
We just didn't like the direction we were heading where every tank had an ability to guarantee that incoming adds would head right for them, and every tank had an ability to do reflective damage that had literally no decision or skill on the part of the tank to employ.<br />
<br />
Use your Consecrates, Shockwaves, Swipes and Death and Decay when they would have the most impact, not on cooldown. Get adds to stick to you because you use abilities at the right time, not because once a mob hits you, you generate free threat.

Shield of Righteousness outdated in current Beta Build<br />
The actual tooltip says:<br />
<br />
Slam the target with your shield, causing Holy damage. Consumes all applications of Holy Power to determine damage dealt:<br />
<br />
1 Holy Power: 30% Attack Power<br />
2 Holy Power: 60% Attack Power<br />
3 Holy Power: 90% Attack Power<br />
<br />
Shield Slam hits for 100% of attack power, but it's physical damage. On the other hand, it doesn't require a secondary resource. <br />
<br />
[...] It's not Shield Slam and it's not intended to fill that role. I was merely offering that so players would have a point of comparison for the kind of numbers their attack should produce.<br />
<br />
We had pulled SoR from the beta because it was one of the things that, in our minds, made the Prot paladin and warrior feel too similar. We wanted to bring it back because paladins like the ability, but we didn't want to bring it back as a Shield Slam clone. <br />
<br />
[...] If you use Shield of the Righteous with 1 stack, you hit softer, which may not be that big a deal since you can do it again after the next Crusader Strike / Hammer of the Righteous. However a 1 stack Shield of the Righteous only grants 5% block, which may be less than you want. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399150496/new-shield-of-righteousness/))<br />
<br />
Holy Shield<br />
To add to my previous tooltip, here is Holy Shield. Remember it's a passive now.<br />
<br />
Your Shield of the Righteous hits increase your block chance by 5% per stack of Holy Power consumed. Lasts 20 sec.<br />
<br />
As far as the burst threat concerns go, use Avenger's Shield. It hits very hard in Cataclysm. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399150496/new-shield-of-righteousness/))<br />
<br />
Words of Glory / Holy Shield<br />
We're talking about 15% block here, not 15% damage reduction. Sure over the course of a fight, you'd notice 15% block. But if you let Holy Shield drop for a few seconds you have virtually no way to know if that would even affect the next several seconds of the fight. Would you have blocked anyway? Great! You didn't need the Holy Shield. Would the boss have hit you even with the extra 15% block? Bummer, you wasted Holy Shield. If it's a dragon breathing on you, then the block does nothing.<br />
<br />
We want Prot to be able to use Word of Glory sometimes and we're evaluating the best way to make that happen. We don't want a model where Prot uses the heal on cooldown because then we just have to assume it's up all the time and it feels more like something you have to maintain instead of something you can use for emergencies. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399150496/new-shield-of-righteousness/))<br />
<br />
We're less sure about Inquisition. It's fine if Ret is designed around keeping it up nearly all the time because they're only spending Holy Power on damage attacks otherwise. With Holy Shield though it might feel like Prot needs to keep two Holy Power-based things running, which is probably two much to ask of a tank. In the prior model you could choose Inquisition's damage instead of Holy Shield's mitigation, but with the new Shield of the Righteous model, we realize that's probably not going to happen so we need to evaluate if that's okay. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399150496/new-shield-of-righteousness/))<br />
<br />
Divine Purpose and Holy Wrath<br />
We changed Divine Purpose yet again (and probably not for the last time) so that it gives Holy Power on almost all specials. This is one of the major sources of unpredictability in the rotation, so we need to get the numbers right where getting extra Holy Power is fun and that the more skilled players can utilize it better.<br />
<br />
We actually want Holy Wrath to feel like a filler. The reason is that we think it's bad gameplay when players have absolutely no gaps in their rotation. Our encounters get increasingly complex to the point where we often ask you to worry about extra things beyond your core rotation. We also don't want things that break up your rotation (like say a knockback or fear) to be horribly punitive (it can be punitive, but shouldn't destroy your dps relative to someone else's).<br />
<br />
To use the specific example, Ret isn't going to want to skip over a Crusader's Strike or Templar's Verdict opportunity except under extreme duress. But missing a Holy Wrath once in awhile won't be devastating. It might be a dps loss, but it won't crater your dps. We want all of the classes to have the occasional GCD with nothing going on, so long as it is truly occasional and not constant. This is less important with casters because they do have short periods while casting to look around and notice the state of the encounter. With the live DKs for example, there is absolutely no time to do anything but mash buttons, or the whole rotation collapses. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399120271/retribution-tree-in-latest-build/))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / 3.3.5 Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior#,,12213) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=.9r8.warrior) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1676-Warrior-Cataclysm))<br />
Rage Scaling<br />
Bloodrage and Berserker Rage have been off the GCD for ages. Rage has mattered at various points of WoW's history, and neither ability has strictly been used on cooldown in the past. It's a new mechanic causing the problems.<br />
I disagree. I think it is just because rage actually matters as a resource, so things that provide rage now feel like very important buttons instead of convenience abilities. We could remove Raging Blow and Fury's mastery, and warriors would still smack Bloodrage on cooldown just because of rage normalization. <br />
<br />
Currently, Deadly Calm is the only way to proc Inner Rage aside from auto-attacking for ~15 seconds. I'm not sure where the disconnect is. Lack of confidence in players' observations? We're certainly not trying to circumvent the limits and discipline of a rage system.<br />
Players in beta are either in Icecrown-level epics or quest greens. Nobody has gemmed and enchanted Cataclysm raid gear, or even heroic blues yet. Rage won't scale with gear to the degree that it did in the old model, but it will most definitely scale. Haste, hit and crit all have a huge impact on rage generation, and you just aren't going to get high ratings for those until you're in endgame gear. <br />
<br />
On a dummy in live (my benchmark for the leanest possible rage income), I'll only get into trouble if I start fooling around with Heroic Strike or Cleave. That is, I think, roughly how it should be. <br />
Sure, but once you have Blackwing Descent raid gear, you're still going to have a lot more rage. If you never run into rage problems now unless you hit Heroic Strike, then you're going to hit pretty quickly the situation where you never run into rage problems even when you hit Heroic Strike. We normalized rage, but we didn't want to normalize it completely. Gear still makes a big difference for rage income -- just not damage per se. <br />
<br />
If you can, at least consider the relative angle. I haven't tested Fury for a couple of builds; just whacked a dummy for ten minutes on a pre-made after doing the same with Arms, and it was like night and day. Granted, in its cozy epic-80 niche, Fury still has rage close to where it should be. I wasn't staring at greyed-out buttons unless I did something stupid. Really, really fun and free. Just couldn't get that with Arms. <br />
Yeah, I'm actually more worried about things feeling good for Arms, because Arms just doesn't hit as frequently as Fury, so the income is going to feel spikier. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399010267/warrior-12694-changes-and-discussion/))<br />
<br />
Bloodsurge<br />
As I suggested recently, we have already reverted the Bloodsurge change. We don't want Slam to be that predictable. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399120185/warrior-updates-8-4/))<br />
<br />
Bloodrage and Berserker Rage on GCD<br />
Bloodrage and Berserker Rage are on the global cooldown because warriors were just hitting them on cooldown now that rage is something they actually have to pay attention to. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399120185/warrior-updates-8-4/))<br />
<br />
We are hitting them on cooldown because right now we 100% NEED that rage due to the current rage system and the rage starvation going on while leveling. If the rage equation were tweaked so that we can sustain our rotations then we wouldn't need to be hitting them on cooldown. <br />
This is going to be a tricky thing to nail, and we knew it would be. There are some warriors who interpret any limits on their ability to push their buttons as being rage starved. Yet if you literally never pay attention to the bar, then it isn't a resource at all. Your &quot;sustain our rotations&quot; could mean that you should always be able to hit every button when you want to. What is the role of rage in that model? We are taking a look at the ratings decay as you gain levels. Now that the talent trees have lost so much crit, haste and hit, they may be too steep. I just mention that as an example of the kind of thing that is going to affect rage generation. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399120185/warrior-updates-8-4/))<br />
<br />
And if you're worried about Bloodrage being used for activating Raging Blow, then make it not an enrage<br />
It's not really Raging Blow. It's the fact that rage isn't unlimited any more, so now Bloodrage is attractive as a button to hit on cooldown. By contrast, Tiger's Fury is not used on cooldown because you can push it at the wrong time. The health cost isn't a serious consideration of Bloodrage, but eating up a special attack is. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399120185/warrior-updates-8-4/))<br />
<br />
Enrage Uptime<br />
We're going to continue to iterate a lot on enrage uptime. We want Fury to be enraged a lot (say 60 to 75% of the time), but want them to have enough control so that if they run into an unlucky streak, they can use one of their buttons to become enraged. Enrage has a longer duration on our internal builds, but we still want to avoid it being up constantly. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399120185/warrior-updates-8-4/))<br />
<br />
[...] That's not really it. As I suggested above, we don't want Enrage to be up say 60% of time, allowing your cooldowns to then push enrage time up to 100% total. But if we make Enrage on a long duration that means it needs a really small proc chance, which shifts it from being unpredictable to being slot-machine-level random. I'm not worried that there is a sweet spot in there somewhere where you often get Enrage procs to fill in the time in between say Death Wish and Bloodrage. We'd rather lower the damage on the Enrage talent, since getting to the Enraged mechanic is also valuable, especially for Fury. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399120185/warrior-updates-8-4/))<br />
<br />
Bloodthirst<br />
The 3 sec Bloodthirst cooldown definitely makes us nervous, because it leaves so few opportunities to do anything else in the rotation, so we're just going to have to watch it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399120185/warrior-updates-8-4/))<br />
<br />
[...] We might try 4.5 sec too. We just want to make sure Fury has something to do within that window when they aren't enraged, and we don't want that something to be Whirlwind. We also don't want to add yet another new warrior attack just to fill that niche. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399120185/warrior-updates-8-4/))<br />
<br />
Booming Voice<br />
It's fine for Booming Voice to be an optional talent. You can't view it strictly in terms of rage per unit time, because availability counts for a lot too. What I mean is if you had an ability that gave you 100 rage on a very long cooldown, it might not be as useful as something you could rely on more often. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399120185/warrior-updates-8-4/))<br />
<br />
Deadly Calm<br />
The intent is that Deadly Calm will often proc Inner Rage when it has finished, However if you could use it while you were in Inner Rage then you'd just use Deadly Calm to get around the rage loss that Inner Rage is supposed to cause (and in fact, that might make the ability more limiting because you'd be dumb to use it anywhere else). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399120185/warrior-updates-8-4/))<br />
<br />
Titan's Grip vs. Single-Minded Fury<br />
Don't worry about the relative damage increases of Titan's Grip versus Single-Minded Fury. We've made no attempt to balance those against each other and won't spend that effort until we're happy with the basic rotation, which we aren't just yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399120185/warrior-updates-8-4/))<br />
<br />
Heroic Strike<br />
If you have 30 rage and Bloodthirst is on cooldown, then you'll probably hit Heroic Strike. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399120185/warrior-updates-8-4/))<br />
<br />
Recklessness still on GCD<br />
There probably isn't a good reason for it to be, to be honest. We'll discuss changing it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399120185/warrior-updates-8-4/))<br />
<br />
Fury Rotation<br />
Yeah, the windows are what we're going for. It might be that 6-10 sec duration feels better.<br />
<br />
It should be something like this:<br />
<br />
No enrage: Bloodthirst, Heroic Strike, Colossus Smash, Slam procs.<br />
<br />
Enrage: Bloodthirst, Raging Blow, Colossus Smash, Slam procs, with Heroic Strike just for excess rage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399120185/warrior-updates-8-4/))<br />

Rant much? It's kind of obvious to see that they are reshaping classes at their choosing and no where does it state they are finished with the others. Instead of doing little by little of every class why not focus on one or two?<br />

Whilst my rant does reflect my current position, the part about classes being finished was sarcastic.<br />
<br />
No, i do not believe the other clases are &quot;finished&quot; according to Blizzard but it is a huge kick in the balls to everyone else when all you have read is &quot;Warrior Change this&quot; and &quot;Paladin Change that&quot; for 4 weeks while getting fuck all else for other classes.<br />
<br />
Even a small change, or information, would be enough to satisfy...<br />
<br />
It's as if Blizzard have forgotten that the players actually like to theorycraft around incoming changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm unsure how order relates to importance, it's more than likely they're just focusing on a few classes at a time. It'd be difficult, as a developer, to try to think of how to work with the issues of every class all at once. The classes that are being focused on get the most blue posts to explain the current design direction and because often the build is already out-of-date by the time the patch goes live. <br />
<br />
Paladins are having the most work done, so it makes sense that they'd start on them as early as possible in order to guarantee that they'll have time to initiate all the changes they want to make and properly balance them. If they started too late, they might find out things aren't working and wouldn't have time to change direction and then they'd have to revamp the class again the next expansion (which is arguably what happened in WotLK).<br />
<br />
And speaking as a Paladin, we routinely are last in everything, especially in terms of Cata news up until the Beta was initiated.<br />
At one point the other classes got their previews over the course of a week and we had to wait an entire 'nother week to get ours, so... yeah.<br />
Really don't feel bad at all that the shoes on the other foot now. Sucks feeling left out, doesn't it?</div></div><hr />

yeah right.. except it's been since the beta beginning, all the time, tons and tons of warrior's crap, always lots of it and unlike paladins they did not recieve any major overhaul. smells like one huge ass-licking favoritism yet again.

<br />
I'm unsure about the reason for such an extended focus on warriors, I believe their rage got normalized, but as mine is only level 40, I have little insight into how much re-tooling such a change requires. They seem to want to change the way rage is spent/dumped and how enrage mechanics work while also trying to more greatly differentiate fury and arms from each other (barbarian vs fighter in DnD terms).<br />
<br />
I'm sure part of it is also that their vision of tanking has changed greatly and protection warriors/pallies are comparatively more similar to each other than any of the other tanking specs. Additionally, both can be seen as more 'traditional' in their methodology so they're probably using them as the standard of tanking balance (while, again, trying to differentiate them from each other).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The blues are doing the other classes a diservice now. It's not as though Paladins / Warriors have been heavily discussed this recent push. It's been a constant barrage of blue posts on them now for several months. The other classes could use equal attention and discussion with regards to their problems, changes and queries.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least The Southern Barrens is looking interesting. I quite like the concept of it being an Alliance/Horde warzone meant to really stir things up between the 2 factions.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why but those four words made me quite excited. Looking foward to levelling a new character now.<br />
<br />
Shame that the battle for UC is being taken out. After doing it a couple of times it was getting a bit dull, but it's still a standout quest. Maybe it wouldn't work with the redesigned UC, or thet they felt the lore would be a bit off... it's one thing to have old lore in self contained areas, but this quest would have to work in the new world too. Would the new Warchief put up with Forsaken refugees outside Org, for example? <br />
<br />
As for the mini Deathwing, it is likely to be the CE pet, and if it is would be tempted to get the CE edition this time.</div></div><hr />

I'm a little disappointed, or atleast I will be, if mini deathwing is the CE pet. It wouldn't surprise the slightest, but I would definitely be disappointed. Perhaps if it does something interesting, like that SC2 CE pet (which I wish I had gotten now), then I might not be so down about it.

<br />
Whilst my rant does reflect my current position, the part about classes being finished was sarcastic.<br />
<br />
No, i do not believe the other clases are &quot;finished&quot; according to Blizzard but it is a huge kick in the balls to everyone else when all you have read is &quot;Warrior Change this&quot; and &quot;Paladin Change that&quot; for 4 weeks while getting fuck all else for other classes.<br />
<br />
Even a small change, or information, would be enough to satisfy...<br />
<br />
It's as if Blizzard have forgotten that the players actually like to theorycraft around incoming changes.<br />
<br />
It's beta. I know, I know, you feel like if you don't say something they might forget about your issues, but the fact remains that it's beta. The most efficient way to work through a mass change like this is to pick a couple of classes and get them right. Then move on to another couple of classes. At the end they'll tweak any loose ends (the earliest classes will likely need a few pokes to catch up with the last classes) and then they're done. Trying to do it all at once is a stupidly complicated undertaking. <br />
<br />
The point of beta is not to give players a chance to theorycraft with unproven changes that may or may not go live, the point of beta is to get the game working. Whatever you want to see from beta isn't relevant. Beta testers aren't &quot;customers&quot; in a traditional sense, they're volunteer testers. The fact that Blizzard is as public as they are with Beta info and keeping everyone up to date on every patch is a choice. They could just leave the NDA in effect till launch. When they're done with Paladins and Warriors, we'll see more posts on other classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also why get rid of Battle for Undercity? That and the Wrathgate cinematic were the only things i looked forward to while leveling through Northrend.<br />
<br />
At a guess, Undercity is being sufficiently redesigned that it ceases to make any kind of sense. They could phase it of course, but it would be really jarring running through &quot;Old Undercity&quot; just for the one questline. Anyone in beta that can verify if UC looks a lot different?</div></div><hr />

<br />
... has someone else taken over Theramore or something? They keep mentioning it as a major player in the Alliance expansion into the Barrens (they're pushing from there, they need to keep the road to it open, etc etc), but as we all know, Jaina would never sign off on war with the Horde, and *certainly* not expanding into their territory like that. I hope there's at least some acknowledgement of this in game... either she's elsewhere doing Council of Tirisfal (?) things like Thrall, or she's being reluctantly strongarmed into it by Varian in return for absolutely necessary resources or something (i.e &quot;If you want grain to feed your people with, help us push back the savage green-skinned abominations!&quot; &quot;:(&quot;) Either that, or Garrosh does something so incoherently and absolutely stupid (like, I don't know, kick her dog or something) that she figures that Thrall was the only sane man in the entire Horde and goes, &quot;screw it.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I suspect that it won't be the CE pet -- it will be available in the Blizzard Store, but one can always hope.<br />
<br />
As to getting rid of Battle for the Undercity -- GOOD RIDDANCE!<br />
<br />
What was the point of it? <br />
<br />
You can have zero impact on the event, you just get to wait five (or more) minutes for the NPCs to get their lazy rears in motion after you tell them you're ready. After they deign to move you run around in their wake and get to beat on things with zero risk to yourself (and no benefits such as XP, or skill ups) while the NPCs do all the stuff of consequence. You get to contribute nothing.<br />
<br />
Seriously. Ending the quest after the Wrathgate cinematic is a wonderful idea. And no, the Alliance version isn't any better. The events are essentially the same so those of you who missed the opposing faction version of it -- you missed nothing.<br />
<br />
Saves fifteen minutes better spent moving on to other quests or tossing off in the restroom. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh my... just realised something else (that has probably already been brought up, but I haven't seen it yet)<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizz has said they aren't changing outlands or Northrend come Cataclysm... but with Thrall being gone, the whole Mag'Har questline suddenly goes up in smoke since Thrall will no longer be there and Gorrosh certainly isn't going to go out to outlands to help Garrosh. ;-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The undercity during the Wrathgate quest is the same as the one you run around in normally. The only difference is that npcÂ´s and objects are phased. The physical location of the zone and your character are the exact same ones as when you are in the Â´normalÂ´ Undercity.<br />
<br />
So if they change anything in Undercity, you will most likely see this in the Wrathgate version as well since itÂ´s the same place anyway. I say Â´most likelyÂ´ because come Cataclysm, Blizzard is able to phase terrain as well, meaning that technically one phase could look entirely different from another, but thatÂ´s probably not how Blizzard intends to use it ;)</div></div><hr />

This. There's no point in trying to balance all four tanking classes at once whilst tank design as a whole is in flux, so it makes sense they're hammering out their plan (less passive, thoughtless threat/AOE), see how it plays out, and then moving on to the next batch of classes. Everyone will get their love, people need to quit it with the paranoia.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do I want to see more on Shaman and Rogues? Of course! But they are focused on Paladins and Warriors, as has been mentioned probably due to tanking and how it affects everyone else. I wouldn't be surprised to see them focus next on Druid and DKs to tune their tank functionality, and then move on to Healing classes. :)<br />
<br />
That's how I'd do it anyway.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: They need to do every class; it will take time, and they don't have unlimited resources to work with.</div></div><hr />

You shouldn't need game files to tell you, because it's common sense. They like to do mini dragons as CE pets, and Deathwing is the big bad, so of course it's going to be mini Deathwing. It was easy to guess before we even knew there was a mini Deathwing model.</div></div><hr />

On another note, about the UC questline, considering how the quests in UC and surrounding areas at 1-60 take place post Varimathras' defeat and Lich King's death, I can actually see why it was taken out. Even though I myself wonder how they're going to work that out chronologically wise with Deathwing...now go back in time and stop Illidan's and LK's forces, now come back and finish the job against Deathwing, I don't see how they could do a &quot;Oh yeah, btw a guy that died 2 years ago is back and trying to take over Undercity&quot;<br />

Is this initially? Since we're over a month into the beta and still only covering two classes, that would mean we got 4+ months of the beta left. What a disappointment.</div></div><hr />

I expect that things will move faster once they get the really hard to balance and complex healing/tanking classes done. The scope of the changes they're making are immense. Just hang in there, they're making progress!</div></div><hr />

Calling it a Quest is a bit generous, though I suppose one of the breadcrumb thingies is just as dull, though at least they're done quicker. It is at best a spectator event, seriously - what's to love about it? You get to wait forever and a day for the thing to start, if it doesn't bug on you, and then you get some buffs that essentially make you unkillable while the NPCs do all the stuff that has effects. You don't actually have any impact on the events that transpire. Might as well be another cutscene. :)<br />
<br />
Boring. Boring. BORING.<br />

I love that they're getting rid of it. &lt;3</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also remember just because they get blue posts and other classes don't, doesn't mean the other classes aren't being worked on as much. I'm not so convinced (yet) that more blue posts actually equals more &quot;work&quot; is being done on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Player: &quot;Waaahhhh Blizz we're too easy to play, all we do is smash buttons that aren't on CD&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizz: &quot;Ok, we'll make them more complex&quot; Introduces new resource system<br />
<br />
Player: &quot;F you blizz you're making them too hard&quot;<br />
<br />
Seems no matter what blizz throws out people will never be satisfied.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem isn't that people are never satisfied but that different people are satisfied with different things. I was absolutely 100% on board with how protection paladins worked in WOTLK. I found the mechanics fun and engaging without distracting from the important elements of tanking (picking up mobs, positioning, etc.) IMHO, I would not have changed a single thing about us (heck, even if Blizz hadn't given us ANY new abilities but had improved warrior/druid/DK tanking to be as fun and effective, I would have been satisfied). Now Cataclysm's rolling out, and I'm sad because they're basically tossing out a good deal of what I enjoyed so much about the class. Almost every announcement and class change has had me cringing in horror as the playstyle I love with my whole heart goes up in smoke. I may not be QQing in the forums about it, but I imagine many people are. So it's more like different groups are complaining at different times... people who found WOTLK pallies to be too simple complained before the changes and are now happy, people like me who were happy in WOTLK are now complaining. So think of it not in terms of players being fickle, but different players wanting different things.</div></div><hr />

Maybe people don't realize this, but Warriors are essentially the baseline class for everything else in the game. Blizzard has always treated it this way. Which is why warriors don't really get a ton of changes once it goes live unless there's a glaring imbalance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As it looks, Consecrate is death and decay. So I imagine it gets talented to 15s cd. But one thing that annoys me is the totally lack of aoe threat otherwise, and I don't see any new spells coming it. Palas used to have consecrate baseline, HotR for snap aggro and SoCommand for sustained aoe tanking.<br />
<br />
(HotR is just an instant cleave)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems unlikely. Expansion release date, while they certainly have a planned and preferred date by this time, is not 100% until the code goes gold and the masters are released fro publication. While they almost certainly plan to release before Blizzcon, and no doubt very much hope to do so, putting the Blizzcon reward in the Cataclysm source files doesn't make a lot if sense. If release is delayed (and it can happen, BC has been verified to have been delayed two months), then they have to go back and put the reward into the release game instead. It's also unlikely, but possible that people might attend Blizzcon, but not have purchased Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
Neither of these is exactly a horribly difficult problem to overcome, granted, but it still seems kinds silly to put a reward for Blizzcon in the beta for Cataclysm. Who knows though, I guess it's possible</div></div><hr />

<br />
It can be &quot;6 years anniversary&quot; pet, remember anniversry is Nov 21th (or was it 22th?) very close to release date (rumors?) of Cata.<br />
<br />
Because every expansion CE has had a mini dragonling that corresponded to the main dragon(s) of that expansion. Netherwing welpling for BC and Frostwing Welpling for Wrath. Of course if doesn't have to be the CE pet, but following the pattern it's most likely, and was most likely before we even saw a model.</div></div><hr />

Mini Deathwing<br />
The latest beta patch added the model of the Mini Deathwing to the game. It could be the Collector's Edition pet but at this point there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in the game files to confirm that. Best viewed with something cute to hug in your arms. (I'm willing to volunteer for that depending on who you are)<br />

<br />
Funny thing is, that watercolor picture seems heavily influenced by the art from Final Fantasy 3(6). Guess you can't escape Japanese style art bro. Also, can i see your fan art? If you don't have any, i'd suggest not shitting on other people's work when you produce nothing yourself. If you do, i'd suggest being a little more open minded to other forms of art or would you appreciate some one calling your work garbage and telling you to give up, simply because of the style you use? While im getting a little tired of the anime style fan art also, there is still no reason to call it garbage and to discourage others from doing it. Don't be a douche, no one thinks you are cool because you don't like anime.</div></div><hr />
