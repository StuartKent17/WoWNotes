Mists of Pandaria Coming to the PTR<br />
BlizzardCS has mentioned the Mists of Pandaria PTR that recently appeared on the Battle.net account pages. The old PTR client is now able to download MigrationContent for the next patch, suggesting that it will be able to update to Mists of Pandaria. <br />
<br />
As a reminder, when the patch is on the PTR and available for testing, it is likely that only the new systems will be in place, not any of the new Pandaria content, similar to the patch that takes place before every expansion is released. <br />

Black Market Auction House Bid Cap Increased<br />
The BMAH has had the bid cap increased to the new gold cap of 999,999 gold. Once you bid that amount, no one can outbid you, but the auction will continue to run for the entire duration. <br />
<br />
A few new Mists of Pandaria items have started to appear since our first post, as indicated by the blank items that are sold by Mists of Pandaria NPCs.<br />

Brewmoon Festival Scenario<br />
Today we have another Scenario preview, the Brewmoon Festival. This is one of the longer scenarios that are able to be tested right now. Keep in mind this is still an early preview and everything is subject to change. <br />

Testing Heroic Dungeons<br />
Currently for a player to enter into a Heroic Dungeon through the Dungeon Finder system requires an item level of 440. Currently, this is a more difficult bar to clear in the beta that it will be in the final live game.<br />
<br />
We're going to work towards hotfixing that value down, but at the same time use some new magic we have to simulate a higher level. When that change gets applied, I'll edit this thread with the news.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, you can actually go old school to test the dungeons. Form a group, then head in through the entrance! I'm making feedback threads for them all, since they're all open. <br />
<br />
The level of the bosses in Heroics should be 92. Note that MoP has a different hit/miss formula than Cataclysm. Check your character sheet for more information. <br />
<br />
We're looking into the character stuck issue, I don't have an ETA. We have the hotfix ready to go, just waiting on some logistical issues to be handled. It should hopefully be deployed by tomorrow morning PDT. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/225818-testing-heroic-dungeons/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5638007026?page=1#1))<br />
<br />
The New Spellbook<br />
We know from feedback and from testing that dividing spells among 3 tabs felt arbitrary to a lot of players. Some players didn't even realize they had access to some spells. The current design has all of your class spells in alphabetical order, with the exception that active abilities (those you can drag to your bar) come before passive abilities. We would consider a design where the passives are mixed in with the actives. (The general tab is for anything that isn't related to your class, such as racial abilities and things like riding.)<br />
<br />
We've seen some ideas from players that we should attempt to categorize class abilities further, such as offensive vs. defensive, or buffs vs. heals, but worry that it would be very challenging to come up with a single organizational scheme that is intuitive to most of our players. I think it's like one of those deals where everyone organizes their hard drive, desktop or email inbox differently. Some people have tons of little categories that make sense to them (key point) and some keep everything in one big bucket. There isn't a one-size fits all scheme that works.

Jumping the Shark Quest Bug<br />
Fix for this is coming in the next build. It's a bug. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/225847-jumping-the-shark-bug/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5642266401#4))<br />

Glyph of Stampede<br />
The design intent is that Stampede skips over any unusable pets (such as an exotic for a non-BM) hunter or any blank slots (in the case that maybe you left a hole in case you tame something interesting along the way). For any skipped slots, Stampede would just clone your current pet for that slot, so you would still always have 5 pets when you Stampede.<br />
<br />
The idea of the glyph is that it would use the clone mechanic all the time. Theoretically, a hunter with only one pet would be wasting the glyph.

They're saying the pre-Mists of Pandaria patch will be available for Beta Testing. It'll be the introduction patch before Mists is released, with all the changes for Mists being applied (like talents, account wide achieves and mounts, etc.), just none of the new zone content.</div></div><hr />

Gold farmers are actually *hurt* by the BMAH because the gold is taken out of the economy completely (vs. shifting around, where they have a chance of getting it back through nefarious means); and well, it is basically meant for the 1%; it is the ultimate gold sink, but instead of something arbitrary like the Pandaria Flight License needed to complete content {which isn't so much a gold sink as it is a Toll}; the BMAH allows those with excess funds to burn it on fun items that they may not have.</div></div><hr />

Sadly just because its INTENDED as a gold sink does not mean a large portion will buy gold. Blizzard NEVER thinks these things threw and offering any form of mount for gold just to drain it from the AH is just going to influence all kinds of players to buy gold because THEY want those mounts too. <br />
<br />
You cannot offer anything in this game without ensuring its not ridiculously out of reach or you will have massive flame wars, waves of people quitting, etc. Since this involves tons of gold I predict increase in gold buying, more gold site spams than ever before, and a wild fire of account hackings.</div></div><hr />

This is where I come in and say: BLIZZARD has the data how much gold players have and NOT you. So, we do not need to convince you. The cap of 999 999 is there, doesn't mean it will be met on every bid (or on any)<br />
<br />
As for your post before saying it encourages to buy gold: If you buy gold and your account gets hacked in the process or you get caught, well - you can still face a perma ban, right? Is this worth it? I have no experience with buying gold, neither do I want. 100 000 is the limit I can spend on a mount that I REALLY want (and it would be a saber mount for Horde). But If I can't get it for that amount (maybe I can affort 250 000 in MoP) - then so be it.<br />

And this is the bit where I rather trust a company with 20 years gaming experience and knowledge of their servers than people on the forum. You don't consider for a second that Blizzard will shine a light up ANYONE's arse who spends over 500 000 on a AH transaction and if they find that gold just BAM appeared yesterday on your account they ban you forever? Now who isn't thinking this through?</div></div><hr />

I bet we'll see mists around the same date as last years Blizzcon. Because that's when they'll need to hook people for another year on the annual pass. The MMO community in general isn't as loyal and patient as it used to be. People will quit for the next new shiny in a heartbeat, and Blizzard know it. So they'll most likely take advantage of the fact that MoP IS the new shiny at that point (well in theory atleast, sorta....). Blizz know their community by now, and know that MoP itself won't be able to keep most players interrested for 12 months without a written contract. And I bet the rewards for the next annual pass will be pretty juicy too, because another steed and a free DL of the Diablo III or SCII expac won't cut it imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
And on the topic of the BMAH and gold sellers. YES, more people will buy gold because of it. NO, it won't be a goldsink for those that currently sit on ridiculous amounts of gold. Because those are AH players for the most part, and they won't spend their precious gold on silly stuff like that. To them the gold itself is the reward.</div></div><hr />

Late at night I take out my gold and stroke it. My preciousssss...<br />
<br />
More seriously, I can't think of any item I'd bid 999,999 on, but I would be open to paying, say, 300k for the Ashes of Alar. Because I want my sad saga of having farmed Kaelthas 8548656743463 times with no drop to finally have a happy ending.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and what history shows is that from the date the beta is unofficially over (when blizz has enough of the major components tested) there is a 2 month (minimum) period before the game is released due to the need to press the gold cd, prepare several million copies, finalize the box and ship product to merchants.<br />
<br />
so there is absolutely no way for there to be a july release - the absolute earliest release date is in August (highly unlikely), the likely release date is mid Sept and the back-up date if there are major issues is Oct<br />
<br />
Sorry man but this is not the truth.<br />
Do you remember Cataclysm? we had to pre-download content and after installing it, we could play Cataclysm.<br />
BUT.....if you instal Cataclysm for the first time, like i did the release day, thinking there was something on the DvD, you will find out that you need to download a HUGE patch.<br />
I remember that i was angry thinking &quot;wtf i buy a new game that the day of release needs a 5 giga patch ?&quot;<br />
<br />
That's because Blizzard didn't create the phisical DvD when the game was finalized.<br />
<br />
This means they can start already to burn the discs and ship them to resellers because they don't need to give you the final version of MoP (because you can pre-download a patch for the diffs)</div></div><hr />

4.0.1 went live 12 oct 2010 <br />
Cata beta ended 22 nov 2010 <br />
Cata was released 7 dec 2010 (3 months after ptr)<br />
<br />
let's assume 5.0 goes ptr next week, 12 june .. that would make roughly 12 september release date.. which fits imho. September has always been the most likely release date for me. There is no way on this green earth MoP will launch in July. Not unless Blizzard are about to do something in one month that previously took three. Blizzard are very predictable when it comes to this sort of thing. They stick to what works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They should either<br />
<br />
A) make yearly expansions <br />
B) keep the game content updated until the end of the expansions life-cycle<br />
<br />
How it is now is really dreadful, I think they know that, but they aren't willing to spend resources on it. Icecrow year was horrible and Dragonsoul is just the same now - boredom.</div></div><hr />

We've got a bright one here, folks. As if it didn't clearly state at the beginning of the news post that you wouldn't be able to access MoP content on the PTR, it's not like we could use, oh, just the last 3 expansions as an indicator that you're wrong.<br />

<br />
You are right in that regardless of the date that they press the cd's you can expect to still have to download a patch on release day because of changes they make after the unofficial close of beta, defined as enough core assets of MoP having been tested, which should not be confused with when the beta actually ends.<br />
<br />
That being said, they are not at the point yet in Beta that enough of the core assets have been tested considering lvl 90 was just made available this week. <br />
<br />
And when they are at that point there is still, and always will be, a two month delay for pressing the cd's and shipping them etc and the best recent example of that is Diablo III whose May release date was announced in March.<br />
<br />
So, once again, for those slow to catch on - july release out of the question - august release unlikely unless they are prepared to releaseMoP with as many significant bugs / delayed content as D3, September release a better than 50% probability with Oct being their back-up date if they come across major issues.<br />
<br />
It's not rocket science.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is that? some people have multiple toons capped on gold. I knew a guy who was at over a million in the middle of Wrath, 6-ish months prior to Cata, and since you could have made massive gold at the start of Cata as well...I'm sure lots of people have a million on a few toons.</div></div><hr />

We know from feedback and from testing that dividing spells among 3 tabs felt arbitrary to a lot of players. Some players didn't even realize they had access to some spells. The current design has all of your class spells in alphabetical order, with the exception that active abilities (those you can drag to your bar) come before passive abilities. We would consider a design where the passives are mixed in with the actives. (The general tab is for anything that isn't related to your class, such as racial abilities and things like riding.)<br />
<br />
We've seen some ideas from players that we should attempt to categorize class abilities further, such as offensive vs. defensive, or buffs vs. heals, but worry that it would be very challenging to come up with a single organizational scheme that is intuitive to most of our players. I think it's like one of those deals where everyone organizes their hard drive, desktop or email inbox differently. Some people have tons of little categories that make sense to them (key point) and some keep everything in one big bucket. There isn't a one-size fits all scheme that works.<br />
So much fail in this response. There's nothing wrong with staying with the current spellbook. Blizzard thinks it's trying to help new players, but all they'll end up doing is hurting them.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, of all the changes to complain about. Switching the spellbooks to display all your spells in one tab is not a major change, especially since they're changing it so that your spell pool will differ greatly depending on spec.<br />
<br />
They could add sorting options, sure. A dropdown menu, perhaps, or a search box, just like the profession windows have.</div></div><hr />
