Magtheridon got nerfed too. Didn't take long.<br />
<br />
The Magtheridon encounter has been rebalanced to be somewhat easier and should now better keep to proper raid progression.<br />

<br />
Gruul's health has been lowered, and the damage from his shatter ability has been reduced.<br />

<br />
Grull should now correctly use his hurtful strike ability.<br />

<br />
Karazhan got its share too.<br />
<br />
Nightbane's melee damage has been reduced.<br />
Nightbane's breath attack and rain of bones now target those players attempting to avoid his attacks.<br />
The Romulo and Julianne encounter has been retuned to be less difficult. <br />

<br />
Also a note about Magtheridon<br />
<br />
<br />
We still plan to look into improving the Magtheridon encounter, but no adjustments have been put into motion yet.<br />
<br />
As a reminder, Hydross got nerfed too<br />
<br />
Hydross the Unstable no longer deals a crushing blow. <br />
