2.3 Daily quests<br />
Earlier in the day I noticed that I didn't post about the new 2.3 daily quests, that's a big error because this is probably one of the main feature of the 2.3 (You'll be running them every day !). <br />
<br />
The battleground quests gives marks, gold, and honor.<br />
The dungeon quests give [item=29460] used in Netherstorm to get &quot;free&quot; reputation with one of the following faction (random) : Cenarion Expedition / Consortium / Keepers of Time / Lower City / The Sha'tar / Sporeggar (and people will laugh at you for this one)<br />
The cooking quests give you various cooking reagents and also has a chance to give you one of the new recipe. (See the list in the craft section of the 2.3 information post)<br />
<br />
Update : The 2k honor reward might be wrong, if anyone can confirm/deny in comments I'd be very happy.<br />
Update 2 : 2k honor for the AV daily confirmed, not sure if it changes with the other BGs (but I doubt it). http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/siteImages/images/news/2007/october/pvpconfirm.jpg<br />
Update 3 : The reward still shows up a 209 for some people ... possible PTR bug ? <br />
<br />

Season 3 weapon model change / recolor preview<br />
I forgot to update the new skin of the [item=33766] yesterday, so here it is. Also included another recolor preview from Endarion, showing recolored Hyjal blades and ZA guns. (Note that most of this recolor aren't used in game yet and they don't mean tons of new weapons, most of the probably won't even be used, the original model isn't even used yet)<br />

<br />
It might be battleground related, since av is a huge bg i think its possible that the honor reward from this one will be higher than the ones from warsong, arathi and shit.<br />
i think its definitely going to bring more population into the bgs</div></div><hr />

The rep gained is random as in players have no controll over it?<br />
Can anyone that is currently on the ptr test if the prisson key's that drop from the ethernal mobs in NS also work to gain this rep?<br />
(Should be since they are the same items but with blizzard you never know :O)<br />

Aye probably, the image(+ 2096 honor) is an sct message right? maybe sct is bugged for the ptr?<br />
<br />
Edit: i checked the image again and it doesn't looks like sct but just the normal blizzard floating combat text so dunno really :s</div></div><hr />

thats not an sct problem, if it shows up in the combat log sct prints it out, nothing more</div></div><hr />

Mmm true, then i don't really know. As Boubouille said its probably a ptr bug, some people get 209 honor points others get 2k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
not really that much honor when you consider that on an av weekend, if you played hardcore you can cap yourself in one weekend.<br />
<br />
If dailies give you 2k honor, it just means those people with a lot less time, have a chance at picking up a chunk of honor a day.. For those who ply a shitload, 2k is really not a big amount.</div></div><hr />

If you get on the PTR and just wait one day you'll see a flashing new icon on a pvp daily quest guy giving you 3 marks and 2k honor for wining AV. A good ammount of gold as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering 5 hours of arena spread over a couple of weeks gives you a couple of top end items it doesn't seem so daft to me. You have to also bear in mind that the BG reward items are pretty much entry level gear if you want to be anyway competitive in the arena now.<br />
<br />
A full set of BG gear will set you back:<br />
<br />
27,000 honor for weapons.<br />
8.000 honor for ranged slot.<br />
14,500 honor for chest.<br />
10,500 for gauntlets.<br />
14,500 for helm.<br />
14,500 for leggings.<br />
11,250 for shoulders.<br />
11,794 for bracers.<br />
17,850 for belt.<br />
17,850 for boots.<br />
15,300 for ring1.<br />
11,934 for ring2.<br />
15,300 for neck.<br />
16,983 for trinket.<br />
<br />
Thats a total of over 207k honor needed to get a full set of gear. Assuming fairly average win/loss ratios you are doing well to get 1000 honor an hour these days (yeah, yeah, your BT geared guild does 2k an hour in premades but I am talking about new players here) so that would add up to over 200 hours of BGs just to get geared for arena. This strikes me as a tad excessive and I would be very much in favour of making it a bit easier to get that gear otherwise new players will find it impossible to ever become properly competitive in the Arena.</div></div><hr />

As someone who made it to R12 but didnt have the strength past that back in 2006 (or was it 2005) I find your 200 hours funny. Why would new people need to get free honor loot in a short time in 2.3 when that has never been a concern to Blizzard in the past?<br />
<br />
The daily heroic we've seen gives you 2 badges. The new badge items cost about 60 badges. It would take 30 dailies for a single badge item. 209 bonus honor per daily seems about right to me even if it's relatively even smaller reward than 2 badges.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps because you can play new and fun content to get badges (zul'aman) but in order to get honor you are forced to grind the mind numbingly boring BG's you've been grinding the last 2 seasons and the 2 years before that with the old honor system? Seriously, look at what has been added to PVE and then look at how many BG's has been added since the first 2, that's right a grand total of 2 and you can't really say the world PVP objectives worked out perfectly lol. At least if some good players would still be interested in running premade BG's and you would face premade raids it would've been interesting, but because the real loot is coming from arena now nobody does so anymore, and joining a BG means ending up with 9 people who dinged 70 two days ago, have 7k HP and 0 resilience and are just there to get some free and easy epics.</div></div><hr />

You are comparing the time it took under the old honor system to get the top end gear to the time it takes under the current system to get the beginners gear which is exactly what Season 1 gear is going to be. In relative quality it is the equivalent of the old rank 10 gear with the top end gear now being handed out for Arena games.</div></div><hr />

Will the new BG dailies give Rep? IE Rep with AB, WSG, AV etc. I am finding it almost impossible to rep grind out AB or WSG after BC. AV is easy to get rep with though.</div></div><hr />

The new badge items cost about 60 badges. It would take 30 dailies for a single badge item. 209 bonus honor per daily seems about right to me even if it's relatively even smaller reward than 2 badges.<br />

+200 honor would be worthless. If it is 2k, I'll be able to get the honor gear on my alts and be able to do arenas on my new priest a lot earlier. <br />
<br />
I just want to be able to play competitively in PvP, and unfortunately this game is designed such that gear is required for any sort of competitive pvp. Eliminating tedious, boring grinds that get in the way of having fun is always a good thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Or it just doesn't appear in combat log, but I didn't get a message and I wasn't exalted.</div></div><hr />
