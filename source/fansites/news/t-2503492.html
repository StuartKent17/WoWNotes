You might want to actually post that question on the AMA, y’know... but no, there’s a chance it’ll be removed during phase 1. I believe they said it’ll probably be during the first few weeks/depending on server stability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spoken like someone who has never played a pserver<br />
<br />
Population is always super high at launch but drops off a good deal after a month or so. Last pserver launch I took part in had 14k players online at launch, and just 3 weeks later, we were down to 9/10k at peak.<br />
<br />
I don't see layering lasting more than a month, especially with the dynamic respawn system that Blizz fixed and enabled for Classic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All you've said is actually not really the case.<br />
<br />
- Communication was mostly just PR. They've had a handful of detailed responses to high-profile concerns (which really weren't that concerning, just some part of the community made them big), and that was that. Many actually relevant technical questions have been gone unanswered. For example, as an addon author, we've not been given any information, feedback or insight into their plans for the classic UI. In fact they've been making breaking changes to the UI since up to two weeks ago even, and the technical aspects of the Classic UI are appalling, almost feels like an intern did that. Communication with the Retail UI team has been great over the last years, Classic did not have a single word for us.<br />
<br />
- Beta testing was a PR farce. They invited very few people to the actual closed beta (many streamers though!), not even addon authors have been able to get in - which was something that was 100% reliably possible with every retail beta previously. Nevermind that they shut the beta down very early, then re-open it for 3 days, whats that about? PR. If it was about re-testing fixed issues, they would've at least given some rough outline what areas might need testing, but instead they bumped max level and hoped for more PR hype.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some PR might be involved, but not entirely. Communication has been alot, such as What is bug and What's not. The communication about the different phases, which build they will start with, reasoning etc. Ofc its all PR, but that does not mean its full time commercial. Its actual info and insight in what they're doing and what they hope to achieve. Giving beta access to top streamers is ofc pure PR, and smart one aswell since it will reach to alot of people. But then there is this &quot;entitlement&quot; camps, thoose who played during vanilla, thoose who stayed subbed since vanilla and people like you who feel entitlted cause of author of an addon. There are shit tons of addon authors, Blizzard wants their game fixed firsthand, not having people poking their codes to create and extansion for their game. They want their system fleshed out tested.<br />
<br />
They opened up the beta few days after Name reservation.. My first thought was they want to check their servers once more, since so many people logged in just to reserve names, we almost crashed the login servers. They might have second guessed themselves in terms of &quot;how stable will our servers be during launch?&quot;. <br />
<br />
Not saying you dont have any truth in your words, but I dont blindly think this is just a huge Pr coup either.</div></div><hr />

To you they may seem silly questions but I understand the desire to know how the split will be.<br />
I want to play Classic but do not want to provide any support or reward to the current Retail team if possible.<br />
<br />
I would be much happier with separate subs; I know it is not going to happen as the one sub for both games will help prop up the MUA numbers, a very shrewd move by Bliz, and with good numbers they can continue to pat themselves on the head and exclaim just how good they are while the game slips further down the toilet.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly what I meant, it's a stupid question and a stupid thought process. A WoW sub is not a tax, you have no say over how it's used and no one cares enough, Blizzard or reasonable customers, to actually figure out the percentages.</div></div><hr />

All subbed players had the chance to get a beta invite and quite a few addon authors were in the bunch, I can understand that you feel you didn't get the specialised focus you felt due but I would rather they continue to retest and fix issues to ensure a stable launch.; If only the Retail team had the same sort of focus.<br />
There feedback and action has far exceeded simple PR with thoughtful posts and responses to player raised issues; once again a lesson the Retail team should try to emulate.</div></div><hr />

You are correct it is not a tax, gamers do not have to pay for a sub yet if players do sub and enjoy the product they pay for surely it is healthier for the game overall.<br />

Across their entire business from PR, support, blue posts, server load balancing, you name it. I just want to know if they're going to continue doing this and abandon their main game, or try to do both. In case it's not obvious, you can't switch lots of resources from existing projects without impacting those projects, and I just wanna know if this is the new normal. Given that they can't get their shit together for their actual main product, it seems unlikely that they can do it with two. If you're confident after azerite power, essences and everything else they trashed with this expansion, then good for you man.<br />
<br />
If it's viable they should split it off and make people pay for it separately, rather than just absorb it into their current subscription. Your argument is that the vast majority of subscribers should absorb this into their current subscription fee and just STFU, but I won't :)<br />
<br />
This project came into being because their corporate lawyers had to shut down a fan-made emulator that basically did what they've spent millions doing over the past year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It makes absolutely no sense for Blizzard to instigate a situation where both of their WoW products are competing against one another. <br />
<br />
The fact that you would choose to pay for one and not the other is precisely why they're not going to do that. A sub is a sub when it comes down to it - people who feel strongly enough about not paying for retail that they would refuse to sub for classic (despite wanting to play it) if money from their sub went to both are a minority.<br />
<br />
Doing it the way they're doing it means that there is potential engagement for both products, and as such two separate routes to secure continued engagement and subscriptions for both. It catches the retail-only players, classic-only players, and the players who want both. Without even seeing the numbers it's pretty clear that you would have to be mental to pitch them as separate offerings and close down countless opportunities for cross-sell.<br />
<br />
Regardless of your thoughts on the matter, from a purely sales-based standpoint what you're suggesting only has disadvantages.</div></div><hr />

I was trying to, somewhat cheekily I might add, point out that while he may have a problem with a % of his subscription going towards Classic that others would have a similar problem with a % of their subscription going to things they aren't interested in and thus it was a bit, how shall I say this politely, selective of him to single out Classic when the argument could be applied to many things in the game depending on one's interests and point of view.<br />

The original question is also pretty idiotic to expect an answer to, but it's at least a legitimate thing to wonder about, since the teams are separate. Your &quot;analogy&quot; is pure stupid though, because that's not asking about how much budget they dedicate to a separate team, but rather just a &quot;I don't like X&quot; whine.</div></div><hr />

You have unusually high standards in regards to analogies considering the fact that you can't discuss your perspective without resorting to calling someone childish, idiotic and stupid...when you mature and learn to manage your anger issues I'd be glad to discuss this further with you (not anytime soon i imagine).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ironic that you're calling me immature yet you're the one dodging the arguments. Geniuses wouldn't be geniuses without some of the opposite, I guess.<br />
<br />
Also, anger issues? I guess you're looking for any reason you can find to stick your head in the sand. Seems like you belong on a PvE server after all. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The real answer to this is that Blizzard will keep an eye on subscriber numbers and compare retail players to classic players, look at how many only play retail and how many only play classic, etc, and OF COURSE they'll be influenced by that. Blizzard is way too large of a company to not have people who spend significant time just analyzing trends &amp; statistics, especially ones generated by their own customers.<br />
<br />
The way to not support the retail team but support the classic team is to pay your subscription and only log into classic. That gets the same message across.</div></div><hr />
