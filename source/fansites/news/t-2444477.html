BlizzCon 2018 Q&amp;A Submissions<br />
US users should submit questions on the US forum (https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769758452) and EU users should submit questions on the EU forum (https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17624463069).<br />
On Saturday, November 3 from 3:30 p.m. PDT to 4:30 p.m. PDT on the Main Hall (D) stage at BlizzCon 2018, Lead World of Warcraft developers will answer questions from both attendees and those who submit questions online.<br />
<br />
If you have a question you'd like answered at the Q&amp;A, submit it as a reply to this thread.<br />
<br />
This thread will close to new submissions at 6:00 p.m. PDT on November 2.<br />
<br />
Here are some things to remember when submitting a question:<br />
<br />
<br />
It's important to keep your question brief and to the point so that we can get to as many as we can.<br />
If you see a question in this thread you would like an answer to, please feel free to &quot;Like&quot; or upvote it.<br />
We anticipate there will be a lot of questions. With so many, we won't be able to ask them all, but we'll do the best we can.<br />
Please make sure you're asking a question versus making a statement.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole point of adding all these features, for example QoL and so on was to make the game more attractive to casual players and gain more subs, right? YOU DID ALL OF THIS but yet with every expansion the sub count just went down and now it's at the lowest it has been. I am not saying that the expansions weren't good, I'm talking about the changes they brought (completely made wow lore irrelevant, features, balances, QoL etc..). So why do you keep on going down this path that's been failing for over 10 years. Clearly there is a pattern and the plan you had is not working, it's been the same thing for over 10 years and it hasn't changed, the sub count is going down and now it's at the lowest it has ever been. All the changes you do just makes things worse and players keep on leaving the game.<br />
<br />
So why keep dumbing the game down when you are not gaining more subs? The whole point of this was to get more subs but it didn't happen, actually, people left the game faster than before but yet you still are sticking with this plan even tho it's losing you money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We don't see sub numbers anymore, so it's hard to factually state that sub numbers keep going down. We all assume they have been, but there really aren't any &quot;facts&quot;. <br />
If they are losing money and subs and have been for as long as you are claiming....they would change direction pronto. They are a company and they like money. While the forums are very loud with people who dislike the game, it seems to be doing fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And then pay random audience members to ask them? :)<br />
<br />
Those are real questions from real people. But of course they only pick questions they actually can/want to answer. What would be the point to pick questions they don't currently have answers to? A lot of &quot;We don't know yet, we'll talk about that internally&quot;? Seems like a lot of fun to get answers like that! Nothing is decided by one person, so unless they already have a decision on something from the team responsible, they factually cannot answer.<br />
<br />
Its obvious to any sane person that such an event will reveal as much information as they actually want to reveal. You won't trick them into giving you some &quot;promise&quot; that they didn't want to give by asking some sneaky question.</div></div><hr />

Hey Blizzard, do you read the comments on mmochampion to fetch questions for the Q&amp;A? Because you know, people keep posting them there.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falconius</div><div class="date">2018-10-29, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With group finder, LFR, and now the community features, being in a guild is becoming less and less important. Are there any plans to make being in a guild more attractive? The guild system in general needs some love, for example UI update, perks, and &lt;cough&gt; garrison like guild housing &lt;cough&gt;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Didly</div><div class="date">2018-10-29, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question. <br />
<br />
Why does Blizzard allow tournament players access to gear vendors but force players on the live game to suffer through unfair games? Real players are forced to grind gear in order to compete in arena, yet the tournament players have access to normalized gear for fairness.<br />
<br />
There is inconsistency in that. If it would unfair to force tourney players to bring the gear they have, then why do they force live players to do it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know why anyone bothers. They won't answer anything of substance, one of the blues recently posted that the entire thing is completely curated, they will only answer the ones Ion wants answered. Especially right now - the pitchforks and torches have been stowed (for now), but there's a lot of resentment and frustration bubbling away out there. <br />
<br />
You have better odds of getting a question about female troll hairstyles in, so Ion or Lore or one of the other devs can wax rhapsodically about &quot;what it means to be troll hair&quot; for 5 minutes, than getting the questions we all want answers to addressed.</div></div><hr />

It is kind of obvious. They will have tens of thousands of questions. You could answer nothing but pet battle questions for two hours. They can set the agenda very easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I submitted a question on the US forum about when pathfinder part 2 would be released and if they could at least give us a patch # (8.2, 8.3, etc.).<br />
<br />
Someone in here asked about heirlooms. That's a good one too but I suspect they'll be upgraded to 110+ with the flying patch.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if Blizzard will eventually stop with these Q&amp;As. The feedback from the players don't seem that great :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that they know the questions ahead of time and cherry pick them makes the times they just ramble on even more annoying. Because its just a time waste tactic.<br />
<br />
None of the BFA Q&amp;A's have shown otherwise that Blizzard really cares about customer feedback.</div></div><hr />

A twitter post very loosely mentioned how the item level scaling works, but people are still frustrated and unsure how to increase the cache's item level. Can you please elaborate in detail on how the item level for Azerite Armor Cache's are determined and how the player base can increase their reward?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zachsophone</div><div class="date">2018-10-30, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This question is mostly about QoL and all the features you added to make the game easier and more attractive to casuals.<br />
<br />
The whole point of adding all these features, for example QoL and so on was to make the game more attractive to casual players and gain more subs, right? YOU DID ALL OF THIS but yet with every expansion the sub count just went down and now it's at the lowest it has been. I am not saying that the expansions weren't good, I'm talking about the changes they brought (completely made wow lore irrelevant, features, balances, QoL etc..). So why do you keep on going down this path that's been failing for over 10 years. Clearly there is a pattern and the plan you had is not working, it's been the same thing for over 10 years and it hasn't changed, the sub count is going down and now it's at the lowest it has ever been. All the changes you do just makes things worse and players keep on leaving the game.<br />
<br />
So why keep dumbing the game down when you are not gaining more subs? The whole point of this was to get more subs but it didn't happen, actually, people left the game faster than before but yet you still are sticking with this plan even tho it's losing you money.<br />
<br />
Blizzard hasn't reported their subs in years. There's no way you can know what the sub count is lol. All we can do is speculate, but not facts. Just keep that in mind.</div></div><hr />

I think I summed up a lot of the questions people will submit.<br />
<br />
You forgot “dur dur when can eye flie in baffle for azerot”<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
Outside of stuff I know they won’t answer (even though I still posted the questions in the forums) like customization, exploration / mount innovations, bring back the stuff you watered down etc. I truly badly want to know one thing above all else. <br />
<br />
What in God’s name ever, and I mean EVER, possessed them to implement the horrific GCD change. I mean seriously. Raiding is about the only thing in a good place but WoW was always known for having a hyper fluid combat system. To mix in the awful clunky GCD changes while at the same time watering down class mechanics has to be one of the most egregious and confusing changes to the game to date. Like what was the point? I know they gave an answer but their answer is so stupid. Like brain dead stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
8.2 or 8.2.5 seems good for flying in all seriousness :P Maybe that's something we will get a teaser about at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
And then people can come back to the game who quit shortly after launch and complain that they don't have something people who have been playing have earned :) Like they did in Legion</div></div><hr />
