<br />
Raidcomp Updated<br />
Raidcomp (http://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com/) has been updated to fix tons of outdated stuff. There are still a few bug fixes on the way, but it should look better!<br />
<br />
Armor % renamed to Physical Damage Reduction<br />
Damage % - Added Arcane Empowerment<br />
Damage Reduction % - Removed Grace, effect has been moved to Renewed Hope. <br />
Mana Regen (Pet) removed.<br />
Mana Regen renamed to just &quot;Mana Regen&quot;. Now includes Mana Spring Totem. <br />
Replenishment can now include Enduring Winter (Frost Mage)<br />
Attack Power reduction - Include Vindication for Protection Paladins<br />
Healing debuff - Fury Warriors' &quot;Furious Attacks&quot; delegated to a &quot;maybe&quot;.<br />
Melee Hit Chance Reduction: Insect Swarm and Scorpid Sting are marked as &quot;maybe&quot; since Balance Druids will glyph out of it and Hunters will often use another sting.<br />
Hunter debuffs that are dependent on pets are declared as a &quot;maybe&quot;.<br />
Raid buff scrolls: Blessing of Kings, Mark of the Wild and Power Word: Fortitude as always marked as &quot;maybe&quot; once there are 1 or more of any class in the raid.<br />
<br />
There is a slight bug with tooltips not working properly on spells and a few other things, most of them should be fixed by the end of the day. <br />
<br />
<br />

Well you two aren't the only ones. One thing to note about the comments praising DLC every week is it's always the same &quot;DLC wins again!&quot; and such. Every week same damn comments and pretty much every week I think the comic blows. At least the MMO-Report is always decent.</div></div><hr />

Excellent work on the raid comp tool nonetheless. The only other omission is, as Gridlock pointed out, Hemorrage. But who raids as Subtlety any more?<br />
<br />
Maybe Hemo should be buffed to be a mangle and savage combat rolled into one. I guess that's really treading on Arms warrior territory....</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what the OP was referencing, but Healing (Debuff) should also have Shadow Priests listed (our 'ghetto mortal strike' is 20% healing reduction from Improved Mind Blast).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graendalf</div><div class="date">2010-03-29, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been playing around with the raidcomp tool.<br />
<br />
Adding one or more druids, paladins or priests won't change the status of respective class buffs: (gotw, kings, fort).<br />
<br />
The only way of changing the status of the status of the above buffs to certain is adding three paladins even without adding priests or druids to the raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What, if anything, does that physical damage dealth debuff stack/not stack with?<br />
<br />
Hemo isn't a raid buff, as the stacks are limited and has constant damage. The damage only scale with the rogues AP and not with the other people triggering it. The end result is the same as if hemo did those 10 stacks of damage in itself. (Except it can be refreshed before the stacks are consumed.)<br />
<br />
It's like if half of fireballs damage didn't do damage instantly, but instead got added to someone elses damage later.<br />
<br />
To be frank, it's a pretty annoying mechanic and should be changed.</div></div><hr />

1) Protection Warriors cannot bring Furious Attacks... that would make you a Fury Warrior. Listed as maybe but should be No.<br />
2) Non-BM Hunters cannot bring Stampede. Rhino's are exotic. It is listed as Yes for all hunters, but should be Maybe for BM Hunter's and No for the others.<br />
3) All Hunters should be Maybe for Attack Power debuff. They can get this with Demoralizing Screech.</div></div><hr />

Hey, it was unavailable at that time! Couldn't check if they were still missing, nor could I remember them off the top of my head. I'll try and see if there's some stuff you missed and add them to this post.<br />

Missing: Disease damage taken (Unholy - pretty important one too), Spell Crit Taken (Demonology). With a quick glance, rest of the stuff was mentioned. Some of them were fixed as well.</div></div><hr />

As an adherent of gnomish engineering, I take offense at this. Everyone knows that gnomish failures end in explosion or transmogrification, not server downtime. Clearly this is the fault of some trollish misapplication of voodoo.<br />

Agreed. That's just ignorant. I expect a higher degree of professionalism from MMO-Champion and all their differently-enabled staff.</div></div><hr />

And MM hunters should not have Trueshot as a maybe. If you have a MM hunter and no other ap buff he will always have trueshot.<br />
<br />
Totem armor category is missing entirely. If you have a 2 shamans or DK+shaman you're gonna have stoneskin.<br />
<br />
I guess paladin auras was left out by choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a matter of perspective... You can't say &quot;we have a MM hunter so we'll have TSA&quot;, because it's just not in a standard spec. If you have people speccing TSA on instructions, sure you'll have it for certain, but that's true of any other buff as well.</div></div><hr />

I really like your raid comp tool, but there is a small mistake in it: A warlock demonology will ( at least, should normally ) put the &quot; Improved shadow bolt &quot; debuff, so the &quot;Spell Critical Strike Chance&quot; is satisfied.<br />
<br />
At part than that, /love DLC and keep on the good job</div></div><hr />

If they are running some kind of traffic tracker, they should be able to check how many hits were referred from MMOChampion.</div></div><hr />

About half the time when I open the page up without a cookie in it, my session fails and I get a generic white screen.<br />
<br />
This can be caused by one of the following issues that I can think of:<br />
<br />
1. Server where actual PHP is being rendered is horked.<br />
2. LB configuration is horked.<br />
3. Cookie issues in the configuration on the LB.<br />
<br />
Steps to reproduce:<br />
<br />
1. Completely close your browser.<br />
2. Open it back up, go to http://www.mmo-champion.com/forum/<br />
3. Watch white screen appear, half the time.<br />
<br />
It might also have something to do with the fact that I'm &quot;logged in indefinitely&quot;, which might cause issues if it bounces off the server without the session attached to it.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, something you guys might want to look into.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
PS: Now, before You all say anything, I want to say that I am a sysadmin and do have to deal with troubleshooting this kind of stuff on a daily basis.</div></div><hr />
