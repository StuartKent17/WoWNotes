Method Raid History World First Timeline<br />
Method has released a nice timeline of world first kills! <br />
<br />

Glory of the Argus Raider Achievement Complete<br />
The Achievements Discord has completed the Glory of the Argus Raider (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11987-glory-of-the-argus-raider) achievement both in the US and EU. <br />
<br />
The EU group was lead by Nightswifty (https://twitter.com/Nightswifty) and the US group was led by Yonexx (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/thrall/yonexx).<br />
<br />
The Achievements Discord (https://discord.gg/VTS4mFQ) is a community where players can form groups for achievements and meet like-minded completionists. Groups often complete Herald of the Titans (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/3316-herald-of-the-titans), Show Me Your Moves (Show Me Your Moves!), Glory of the Argus Raider (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11987-glory-of-the-argus-raider), and all other kinds of activities as well. Players are provided with roles that match their regions and factions in order to be notified whenever someone is organizing an event that they might be interested in, which makes forming groups much easier.<br />

Worgen and Goblin Model Update<br />
As mentioned during the Q&amp;A earlier this month at BlizzCon: there won't be new Goblin &amp; Worgen models in time for 8.0, but we are currently working on them. No specific ETA at present, but it's something we definitely hear you on.

<br />
Flippant comment aside, I think it's more that groups and information are respectively far better organised and readily available these days.<br />
<br />
It's pretty cool actually to see what some groups are capable of -be it World First, Glory, Secrets Discord or 3k M+ ratings -they are all achieving it with time dedicated to the game and with organisation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it has nothing to do with that.. you dont need to do anything on the highest difficulty, you can do everything on normal and normal is a cakewalk.. thats why its easy</div></div><hr />

There's not a mount afaik, and no. We're talking about raid groups in 940-945 ilevel gear who overgear the content the day it comes out finishing heroic, not random guy #2956827 who has 915 ilevel, no tier with bad legendaries.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really, the 150+ Guilds clearing Heroic 11/11 in 2 days are all overgeared? I don't even dare to look at the normal clears. Anyone who is around 915 should try some M+ Dungeons once in a while.</div></div><hr />

Heroic+ drops a quest for a mount, the solar spirehawk looking thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...only because you have to factor in people leveling to 60, which no other raid boss has.<br />
<br />
If you count from the first MC boss kill, Rag was only alive for 95 days.</div></div><hr />
