Clarification on Battle For Azeroth's Pathfinder Achievement<br />
The recently datamined Battle for Azeroth Pathfinder, Part One (https://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/12989-battle-for-azeroth-pathfinder-part-one) stirred up some controversy recently when it included both Kul Tiras and Zandalar questing achievements. The good news, however, is that it only requires one continent and not both!<br />
Looks like the requirement to level characters from both faction to max and run quest lines with each is staying (not a bug). It's still an after patch and the devs won't respond for clarification on it on the forums or on twitter. Looks like you're gonna have to have to max level grind out achievements on 2 characters (different factions) in order to get flight in bfa. Kinda sucks for those who pre-ordered and used that character boost already.<br />
Just some clarification on this, you do not need both factions for Pathfinder Part 1. You will only need either Horde or Alliance side.<br />

North American Arena World Championship Recap<br />
Blizzard posted a recap of the North American Arena World Championship and what played out!<br />
North America Can't Bust The Move<br />
<br />
With the Spring Finals in the books the teams from North America are looking to regroup and take on the challenge of the summer season in the Arena World Championship. The first North American Cup would set the tone.<br />
<br />
Method Orange Falter Early and Regroup<br />
<br />
Method Orange were the top seed in North America at the Spring Finals but the road to the top was cut short in the first round where they dropped to Reformed and XRB. Coming into the summer, Method had a lot of work to do to retain their crown in NA, and got off to a poor start, falling to Super Rejects 3-1 in the upper bracket of the double-elimination tournament. Method then went on a lower bracket run beating everyone to get to the final versus The Move, a run that included overcoming Super Rejects.<br />
<br />
The Rejects Can’t Keep the Spring Finals Level<br />
<br />
The Rejects, now known as Noble were the most improved team at the Spring Finals and finished with the silver medal. Coming back to North America, the question was whether the Spring Finals were a fluke, and Noble did nothing to disprove that theory. With a first round loss to Method Orange followed by an elimination at the hands of Super Rejects, Noble have a lot of work to do to recapture the form they showed at the Spring Finals. Noble came in with a variety of compositions including a slower RMP as well as some more aggressive cleave compositions. This is in stark contrast to the RMP that the then-The Rejects used during most of the Spring Finals.<br />
<br />
Sneakier Snakes are Still Sneakily good<br />
<br />
The Sneakier Snakes were one of the bottom teams at the Spring Finals, going two-and-out just like Method Orange. Now playing in the summer season as Kaska’s Angels, they wanted to show they had what it takes to stay at the top of North America, with their only losses coming at the hands of The Move and Method Orange. Losing 3-0 to both might not be inspiring but Kaska’s Angels are looking to stay in the top four with that third-place finish and quietly hang around the top of North America.<br />
<br />
The Move Back With a Vengeance<br />
<br />
The Move did not make the Spring Finals, finishing eight points below Sneakier Snakes for a disappointing 5th place. Coming back from that disappointment, The Move showed a dominant performance in the first North American AWC Cup of the summer season. With a 3-0 win over Plot Twist, Super Frogs, and Kaska’s Angels, The Move ended up facing Method Orange in the grand final. In an incredibly tight game that included taking a nail-biting series to Game 7 in the Blade’s Edge Arena, The Move took the series 4-3 and secured their first win of the AWC as they look to tighten up the rankings with an eye towards BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
Whether The Move can sustain this level of play will be up in the air for the next two weeks with the AWC moving back to Europe for the second European cup. Method Black and Reformed will be looking to stay on top of those regional standings and supercharging the debate over which team is the world’s best.<br />

Mage Tower Quest Line<br />
So i have completed the Gift from the six quest line as a demonology but my gear is for affliction is it possible to get the affliction mage tower quest whitout completing demonology's quest first.<br />
Each spec will have it's own questline, and you can have all three in progress as long as you meet the criteria for them (having the base 35 traits unlocked in that specs Artifact)<br />
<br />
You actually have the Affliction questline already, &quot;Message from the Shadows&quot;<br />
<br />
Carry on with that one and you'll be able to get through to the Mage Tower Challenge for this spec too. (Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17619612040?page=1#3&quot;))</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all leaving does not make you a traitor you idiot. She did nothing against the Alliance. She did not attack or hamper them in anyway. She did not sell off info to the alliance enemies. Learn the what an actual traitor is before randomly tossing it out. Nor can you impeach her. She doesn't hold an elected office. Next you played beta. BETA! It's a well known fact that several things aren't in the beta still like cineamatics and the major pre-patch bfa storylines aren't fully finished yet.<br />

The comic says that Jaina spent the legion invasion alone killing demons. Since the invasion in lore was world wide, she probably portalled around working out her anger on demons.</div></div><hr />

It means that: we will have new zone for middle patch (because no way they'll introduce flying later than Legion) and we will be able to fly at least on that patch zone. Truly horrific that you'll have to explore small island or something.</div></div><hr />

Firstly, Rexxar isn't smiling at all in the first description and secondly, Jaina wasn't there at all when her father died. She only came when he was already dead. So, how about you calm your hate boner for her and enjoy the comic?</div></div><hr />

I really don't mind exploring a new continent on foot and getting flying at a later point. With these Pathfinder Achievements it always feels like we accomplished something like learning the lay of the land. We will eventually learn how to fly there when we are ready. Everything is worth more if you have to fight for it. <br />
<br />
Let's take the mounts for example you can get for defeating raid tier endbosses on mythic. When they are new everybody who got it will ride it proudly knowing they did something many struggle to do. When the content is soloable and you get it you might feel lucky but nobody will look at you like they looked at the one who had it when it was rare to have. You obviously can't compare it to flying one to one but this even influences the economy. Herbs, ores and stuff like that are a rarer comodity.<br />
<br />
All in all no flying in the beginning is good for the game. I'd just change one bit, after the expansion is over I'd take flying out of the achievement and make it purchasable. Keep the achievement because it also gives you a mount so it is still worth to earn later on if you collect mounts but you shouldn't punish new players for being new.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, the fact that you still need to do Pathfinder for WOD atm to fly in Draenor is stupid.<br />
<br />
Legion one too but on a lower level, I mean ok leave some achiv for new players like &quot; playing the story of the zone &quot; and then give flying to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe Blizzard will learn soon or later.</div></div><hr />

Oh fuck off, he isn't smiling at all, you have to be blind as fuck or retarded to think that isn't just a fighting face. She isn't delusional at all, Rexxar and Daelin weren't trading quips until one's HP bar got depleted, it was a brutal fight and her father died to a blow from a war axe. Do you know how a body looks after a blow from an axe? Of course you don't... Good thing blizzard doesn't listen at all to your worthless opinion, you only know how to hate everything they put out.</div></div><hr />

every expansion since MoP has had 2 parts to the Pathfinder. this is no different. although it has of course led to the same morons who were carrying on about having to do both factions quests to now claim that this will be in Part 2. (Hint - it won't)</div></div><hr />

However, I really dislike that Rexxar panel. It looks way too much like Rexxar is some conqueror come to own Kul Tiras, where that wasn't even close to his character. Also, it must be a delusion of Jaina's being depicted because in the end she was not against removing her father, and I think if it is Blizzard's intent to change that impact, it weakens her character.</div></div><hr />

Mists you just bought with gold as it used to be.<br />

WoD had 1 part and flying came in a mini patch for 6.2.<br />

Only Legion so far has had the 2 parts to it.<br />

I don't mind pathfinder. Although Part 1 was idiotic because the Suramar story required you to kill Gul'dan. Thankfully they learnt from that for the pathfinder in BFA.</div></div><hr />

Mists you just bought with gold as it used to be.<br />
<br />
WoD had 1 part and flying came in a mini patch for 6.2.<br />

<br />
Only Legion so far has had the 2 parts to it.<br />
<br />
I don't mind pathfinder. Although Part 1 was idiotic because the Suramar story required you to kill Gul'dan. Thankfully they learnt from that for the pathfinder in BFA.<br />
<br />
Ah my bad I thought it was 2. Although had it been introduced at start of WoD it would’ve been 2 parts. Also I said since MoP that doesn’t include MoP</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Both panels are artistic license.<br />
- First panel is Jaina’s perspective/distorted memories; Thrall is leading her away in consolation, Rexxar is angry-faced, and it’s possible those are separate images forming a tableaux.<br />
- Second panel is the same event(s), but from the perspective of the Kul Tiras citizens, who weren’t even there or have a distorted perspective also.<br />
<br />
You are bad at nuance.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kataroku</div><div class="date">2018-05-24, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It means that: we will have new zone for middle patch (because no way they'll introduce flying later than Legion) and we will be able to fly at least on that patch zone. Truly horrific that you'll have to explore small island or something.<br />
<br />
No, it means that they'll hold off on releasing part 2 for 7 months and it'll take another 1-2 months to complete. Just in time for the new zone which you can't fly within anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostglare</div><div class="date">2018-05-24, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see the hatred aimed at Jaina quite often these days. Normally, I keep my peace, but I feel it necessary to give my two cents on the matter in this case.<br />
<br />
It's a coping mechanism.<br />
<br />
Let me explain: I draw parallels between the Horde/Alliance War and those fought on many fronts in real life. The inclusion of cosmic threats like the Legion serve only as temporary distractions from the grievances felt. The euphoria of defeating these insurmountable obstacles does not wash away the hurt of the past. If anything, it makes it worse because now the world where those memories were made has become that much more precious, having survived or prevented an apocalypse... and it does not stop the fear that comes with it. After all, someone's son still died to the enemy invader. Someone's father was still sacrificed for the greater good. Someone's position of authority is imperiled. Someone's culture is threatened. Someone's home. Someone's family. Someone's freedom and their entire way of life. In essence, their world.<br />
<br />
Threatened by the other side, the one that takes up the same planet but lives in an entirely different, alien world from their own that is anathema to their own, evil and frightening.<br />
<br />
Jaina's damaged goods. She admits it herself. She knows she isn't helping, but she can't see any other way. Anduin himself is forced to make the same realization. Every attempt at peace has been ruined by the cracks left by a history that didn't know anything but strife since its inception. Everyone has become victim and culprit both, with only those who have fully withdrawn away and left to observe helplessly having any semblance of innocence left. Compassion, mercy, empathy, these are all finite resources that can be very quickly exhausted, and nothing has successfully happened to replenish them.<br />
<br />
What we are seeing here is a story without heroes or villains. What we are seeing is a global tragedy.<br />
<br />
But I get you. It's not pretty. In fact, it's downright horrifying. Maybe even a little too real, too close to home. So, make your target. Invent your scapegoat. Take a side. I know it's the only way to stay sane... just like Jaina did.</div></div><hr />
