Blizzard has updated the Zandalari Troll (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7379-Battle-for-Azeroth-Allied-Races-Zandalari-Trolls-Preview) and Kul Tiran (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7599-Kul-Tiran-Preview-Battle-for-Azeroth-Allied-Races) race options.<br />
We‚Äôve discovered two errors in our original communications regarding which classes would be available to the Kul Tiran and Zandalari Allied Races. We‚Äôre in the process of updating those communications now, but wanted to call your attention to two important corrections:<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlock was incorrectly listed as an available option for Zandalari at the What‚Äôs Next panel at BlizzCon. The Zandalari have no connection to fel magic, and will not be able to be Warlocks. Mage was incorrectly omitted as an available option for Kul Tirans in the panel and on the World of Warcraft website. While Kul Tiran Mages are relatively uncommon, there are a few prominent examples, and so Kul Tiran characters will be allowed to play as Mage. <br />
<br />
<br />
We apologize for the confusion that these errors have caused.<br />
<br />
This wasn't an error in communication. You just realized after the fact that your judgment was a bit lacking and so you changed some things.<br />
This was simply what it is, an error. We posted one thing on the website and one thing in the slides at the panels. This was a misalignment on assets so we're correcting that now. It happens.</div></div><hr />

KT mages is probably them responding to criticisms, but there was no reason for them to not be so that's good.</div></div><hr />

Even if you want to argue that demoniacs aren't direct parallels to warlocks, they're undeniably connected to fel magic. Sounds like utter nonsense to me and just an attempt at trying to have parity in class numbers rather than abiding by lore.</div></div><hr />

The zandalari one I can see either way they have some capability for it as shown by zul's followers but it does not look like other than zul there are any really obvious warlocks or warlock support in the main zandalari areas so I guess that makes sense. And they got paladins and have 9 options for class which is I think more than any of the other allied races so not a lot there to gripe about.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly what it is. People were crying because Zandalari got so many classes and because Kul Tirans didn't get mages - so they cut one of the Zandalaris and gave mages to Kul Tirans.<br />
<br />
And now they're trying to sell us that this was the plan all along, as we have always been at war with Eurasia.</div></div><hr />

No it's called being unique. That's one of the things I disliked about cata, the new race/class combos. Personal choice is bad when it messes with the story of the game. Like allowing Nelves to be mages, which meant allowing Highborne back into the Kal'dorei society. So you tell me they hated their guts for 10k years but suddenly everything changed in 5 years? <br />
<br />
Pre-Cata's class/race choices were perfect. Heck I'd say they should've stuck with Shaman and Paladin being unique to their respective factions but oh well. IMO personal choice in cases like this sucks, it's just a game, its not like youre not allowed to move to another country or take x career irl...</div></div><hr />

I see were you're coming from, but still think it' wrong for the game. I know people who would LOVE to play DH, but they can't stand elves, so they just don't. They're missing out something that they want to do over something as silly as &quot;blizzard says so&quot;</div></div><hr />

Yeah I don't buy for a second that something the community was waiting for since BfA was announced regarding Allied Race classes failed to get noticed on the slide show. They clearly intended for the races to be as they were announced. Look at the rationale behind KT mages. Every man and his dog would have expected KT mages since the most prominent Kul Tiran is a mage</div></div><hr />

Let's just ignore they actively hunt people for &quot;witchcraft&quot; in Kul Tiras. Let's ignore that Kul Tirans distrust the arcane pretty deeply and that's why Jaina had to be sent away to Dalaran to learn about magic rather than stay home and learn. Who cares about the lore right? &quot;HERP DERP JAYNA IZ MAYJ. ALL KULTIRAN MAGE! STOOPID BLIZZ!!!!111!!!&quot; Fuck I hate how toxic the WoW community has become.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't say its because &quot;blizzard says so&quot;. In other rpg's you have characters that can be one specific class only. Like if I wanted to play druid I'd go either Nelf or Tauren.

This post reeks of entitlement. People make mistakes, people have opinions, people change their opinions. Is nothing ever good enough for you people? Disgusting.<br />
<br />
And when people own up to their mistakes, others forgive them and move on. This isn't Blizzard owning up to their mistake. If they would have simply said &quot;we took the feedback into consideration and agree that the Zandalari have too many class options and the Kul'Tirans don't have enough, so we're removing Warlocks and adding Mages&quot;, yeah there might have been some people upset but it would have been honest. <br />
<br />
Pretending it was all a communication error accomplishes nothing for them. It makes them look unprofessional, because it implies that they didn't even double-check the information they release to the public at a big event they created solely for this purpose, nor did they double check the information on their own website. If that was a communication mistake, how many more were there?<br />
<br />
BFA isn't doing so hot right now in big part because a lot of players feel like Blizzard didn't listen to their feedback during the beta, and they feel like the end result was something rushed and unfinished. Admitting they changed their minds after listening to the feedback, instead of pretending they once again rushed something and did it poorly, would have gone a long way in improving people's view of the company at the moment.</div></div><hr />

Mostly old MMO's, most modern ones are &quot;any race can be anything&quot; because that's what people want. You can scream lore all you want, but the fact is, most people don't care, they just want to play the class they want, on the race they want.</div></div><hr />

Awful human beings? If you go to McDonalds and order fries and get a burger instead, do you not get a mad at the employees for that mistake? And tbh that is harder to avoid, this was just a case of them not even taking that one minute it takes to double-check the slides...that makes them poor employees. We are the customers, we buy their games, and we bought THE VIRTUAL TICKETS and were presented wrong information ON A SLIDESHOW, not a wrong answer to a Q&amp;A question. Let's not even bring up the inexcusable technical problems they had with the Hearthstone panel, having them cut to the Overwatch stage earlier just to not look like total amateurs. <br />

&quot;The Tidesages (also spelled tidesages) or sea priests are a religious Kul Tiran group based in Stormsong Valley, in the Shrine of the Storm. Most people on Kul Tiras look to the seas for guidance the same way others look to the Light, but the tidesages have a much deeper connection with the water.&quot;<br />

Yep, still shamans. Restoration shamans, as they clearly use water spells.<br />

This post reeks of entitlement. People make mistakes, people have opinions, people change their opinions. Is nothing ever good enough for you people? Disgusting.<br />

People are just desperate to believe that the game is struggling without them. <br />
Alex said straight up that he was going to make a case for mage KT humans in a Blizzcon interview. &quot;Reactionary&quot; is a buzzphrase from the people suffering from entitlement issues, same as when they somehow believed that Blizzard put out Old Soldier in a span of weeks as an &quot;OH SHIT!&quot; to the reception of Sylvana's Warbringer... :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even though Zandalari do have a connection to Fel as has been shown throughout the game, if we assume they didn't they still have a Shadow magic connection which also counts for Warlock. If it's good enough reason for Void Elf Warlocks surely it's fine for all the other races who don't use Fel.<br />
<br />
Then we have Kul'tirans who aren't trusting with magic, have an entire zone which has some quests to do with Witch trials &amp; the only Kul'tiran mage we know of had to be sent away to learn to be a mage but that's enough reason for mage to be an option.<br />
<br />
I'm perfectly fine with Kul'tirans being mages under that flawed logic but don't understand why they have to take away Zandalari Warlocks. Why can't we just have something extra instead of it costing something else in return.</div></div><hr />

He hasn't been on the team for a long LONG time now and is a fucking idiot to boot.

Couldn't produce any other source? Go figure. <br />
Kern is a hack, a has-been, and he's bitter AF and always will be. He grasps at ways to remain relevant by latching onto controversies and pretending to be a voice that's worth listening to.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2018-11-07, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So we're supposed to believe that they don't double check any of their Blizzcon content &amp; made two mistakes on the same subject and have changed both of them for lore reasons when both of them contradict current lore.<br />
<br />
Even though Zandalari do have a connection to Fel as has been shown throughout the game, if we assume they didn't they still have a Shadow magic connection which also counts for Warlock. If it's good enough reason for Void Elf Warlocks surely it's fine for all the other races who don't use Fel.<br />
<br />
Then we have Kul'tirans who aren't trusting with magic, have an entire zone which has some quests to do with Witch trials &amp; the only Kul'tiran mage we know of had to be sent away to learn to be a mage but that's enough reason for mage to be an option.<br />
<br />
I'm perfectly fine with Kul'tirans being mages under that flawed logic but don't understand why they have to take away Zandalari Warlocks. Why can't we just have something extra instead of it costing something else in return.<br />
<br />
I can believe Blizzard has gotten so big, that one hand doesn't talk to the other - and this is a minor thing, and not entirely unexpected. The Chronicles were supposed to solidify and make sense of the mish-mash state the lore was in, but they're either not paying attention to the Chronicles, or there's a breakdown in internal communication. Or both. It's just this week's scandal. <br />
<br />
Considering the Kul Tirans now have a magic wielder as their Admiral, I think the whole 'distrusting magic&quot; plotline can be discarded, and will be. Was, actually, since Jaina has already committed the Kul Tiran fleet to a battle, and the overall war.<br />
<br />
You could write an interesting plot arc of the Kul Tiran society coming to terms with being allied with the Kirin Tor, but they won't. They're too busy doing...something, until the Azshara raid drops - this is all fluff until that point, that was the focus of the entire expansion. Sylvanas something something, Tyrande something something, it's all filler.<br />

If anything a Demon Hunter has a stronger connection to the Fel, since intaking a demon soul into themselves instantly corrupts their vessel. A Warlock needs to do magic over time for that to work. <br />

In any case, the language used here is too vague for that kind of reasoning to work as a defense. The connection part isn't the issue.</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying &quot;Zandalari should be demon hunters&quot;. I'm just saying that the Demoniac sect is much more akin to demon hunters than warlocks. Both take a demon into themselves to take their powers. They don't summon demons and make binding contracts with them for power, like warlocks do.</div></div><hr />

Gameplay often trumps lore, and I accept characters who role play outside of lore. I don't mind if characters are &quot;snowflake heroes&quot; as some recent poster suggested.<br />

I'd just accept it as &quot;some time later, that race trained under another&quot; or whatnot.<br />

Even if you want to argue that demoniacs aren't direct parallels to warlocks, they're undeniably connected to fel magic. Sounds like utter nonsense to me and just an attempt at trying to have parity in class numbers rather than abiding by lore.<br />

Are you suggesting we have not been at war with Eurasia at some point? You might want to be careful with that! ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
I like how they say &quot;Zandalari have no ties to Fel magic&quot; ignoring that warlocks are also associated to Shadow magic, and they have been adding Zandalari Warlocks in the game, such as the Zandalari Spiritweavers in Isle of Thunder and Za'roco the Grifter, a named Zandalari Warlock, in Vol'dun. So you keep adding such elements but Zandalari can't be Warlocks, what kind of backwards logic is this, my god<br />
<br />
There just too few. It would not be sufficient to make them an actual part of that culture.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you imagine if the community weren't entitled? What kind of service Blizzard would WANT to give them if people were to give constructive feedback without underlining condescendance? They even went out of their way to mention the error, and they get shit thrown at them. The community could have said, &quot;Oh okay, it was just a miscommunication.&quot; or like... &quot;Well, that makes sense that Zandalari doesn't have ties to Fel magic&quot;<br />
<br />
Can you image what would happen if they acknowledge the well written, constructive feedback that was given by top players for several classes during beta? That was plain, neutral feedback that outlined why some things where bad and suggested some possible fixes for those. What happened with that? Most likely TL;DR<br />
<br />
<br />
You could write an interesting plot arc of the Kul Tiran society coming to terms with being allied with the Kirin Tor, but they won't. They're too busy doing...something, until the Azshara raid drops - this is all fluff until that point, that was the focus of the entire expansion. Sylvanas something something, Tyrande something something, it's all filler.<br />
<br />
Suggesting to show something that's entirely internal to an individual alliance faction? They are humans but they are not humans, humans you can't suggest that! There would at least have to be one Orc somewhere! Alternatively it can only happen in a book.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;While Kul Tiran Mages are relatively uncommon, there are a few prominent examples, and so Kul Tiran characters will be allowed to play as Mage.&quot;<br />

So Blizzard is gonna use this logic as 1 off when it basically justifies almost every class/race combo that doesn't exist to be cannon?<br />

As a player character, we are supposed to be the unique hero, the one who stands out from the crowd and changes the rules to overcome the odds, blah blah, etc.<br />
<br />
This uniqueness is exactly what makes it possible to be a forsaken paladin or human shaman. The restriction that it has to be a race wide thing is pointless. Why couldn't a unique hero have met someone who taught them the ways of a paladin or shaman?<br />
<br />
Why don‚Äôt they do this? Simple. Making totems and Druid forms for every race is a lot of work. Bliz is not about to be an over achiever. I mean come on. At this point all of our new races are just re-skinned old races.</div></div><hr />

Your definition of fair is obviously flawed. We have 4 classes than can be any race, horde have 2. We have 81 class/race combinations (sans pandas), horde have 80 (sans pandas). <br />

Flawed, but i could understand why an alliance alliance player might believe that uneven numbers are fair.</div></div><hr />

Lol I feel the same, the main battle was for them to have paladins. And we won.<br />
<br />
As for warlocks I agree it should be included because warlocks aren't just about demons they're about shadow magic, curses and bazling things up. even if demoniac sect could possibly die out due to them being just few I assume that Hexxers and Pyromaniacs are not that rare.<br />

Cool. I for one welcome our new Kul tiran mage overlords. I hope Jaina is personally training them. :p<br />

<br />
Zandalari have become more open minded with time. While the zandalari training monks is... very strange... the fact that they are becoming open minded enough to consider doing so is kind of incredible. In a good, lore building way. I like it. I can go with this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Or Zandalari have their own fighting style unaffected by Pandaren. Draenei received a background for it in Argus , Jed'hin the wrestling is now their background for monks.<br />
<br />
So Zandalari could be Jaguar warriors like Darkspears are cappoeira practicioners.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't bother me any, I was championing for Paladin, and I guarantee the Scenario to unlock them will be us helping them restore Rezan and that is why Paladin was hidden before now and it likely had very little to do with us asking for them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">therealbowser</div><div class="date">2018-11-08, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gameplay often trumps lore, and I accept characters who role play outside of lore. I don't mind if characters are &quot;snowflake heroes&quot; as some recent poster suggested.<br />
<br />
I'd just accept it as &quot;some time later, that race trained under another&quot; or whatnot.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Actually, coming back to &quot;physical restrictions make little sense,&quot; we get nearly every flavor or warrior, hunter (not monk, rogue or others further out). I don't see physical restrictions as far different than &quot;but they don't do that in that culture!&quot; especially RE: Gnomes are tiny warriors, Tauren are too big to sneak, etc.<br />
<br />
Gnomes have no reason why they can't train to be warriors. It's why even in vanilla they were available. Blood elves couldn't be warriors initially since the blood elves have very few members of their race that would want to pursue mastery of martial training over all other things; i.e. magic, which their culture is known for. Still it makes sense, since while there are few blood elf warriors, there are still enough to warrant a playable class for them.<br />
<br />
Tauren being rogues doesn't make sense because &quot;lolol big hooves&quot;, rather because tauren are totally and completely against the deceptive talents rogues are known by. Frankly I fully expect Grimtotem tauren rogues to exist, but those aren't playable.<br />
<br />
And it's not a matter of 'snowflake' heroes. Some are literally impossible. A draenei warlock would be shunned from society if not outright killed/captured by the draenei for going against everything their society stands for. Undead druids literally cannot feasibly exist. Undead paladins, even, are a huge stretch as their existence would revolve around eternal agony the likes of which no being could realistically sustain.<br />
<br />
And this doesn't even cover the amount of work it would require Blizzard to do so. For instance dwarf druids would require brand new models for every druid form as well as cultural inspiration for it; druids literally require that. Death knights and demon hunters require uinuqe racial customization to a massive extent. So on and so forth. Some classes are easier to give to new races than others; and coincidentally, warlock aside, most of those races have access to them to begin with.<br />
<br />
Even if you think &quot;Snowflake heroes&quot; should exist, it's a bad idea. Period. And for the record, I really don't think it would improve the game or make classes more fun to just blatantly give every class to every race to begin with.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll only give up when we got playable Forest Trolls, lol.<br />
<br />
So in other words no matter what Blizzard does you won't be appeased unless they add forest trolls (which they'll never do)?<br />
<br />
At least you're honest about it.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Or Zandalari have their own fighting style unaffected by Pandaren. Draenei received a background for it in Argus , Jed'hin the wrestling is now their background for monks.<br />
<br />
So Zandalari could be Jaguar warriors like Darkspears are cappoeira practicioners.<br />
<br />
If draenei and zandalari had their own fighting style, they would be fist weapon warriors, which already exist.<br />
<br />
Draenei wrestling techniques of Jed'hin have nothing in common with pandaren monk training. They couldn't be more different. Yet, I imagine a master of Jed'hin would learn pandaren training more easily than, say, someone with no hand-to-hand training at all.<br />
<br />
So you may as well just give up on that to begin with. Pandaren monk training is blatantly and explicitly pandaren in styles, especially since they include brewmaster and mistweaving techniques. If you want to play as a race with hand-to-hand fighting styles that aren't pandaren, just equip fist weapons as a rogue or warrior.</div></div><hr />

Of course they give in to all the shitheads on the forums crying about no Kul Tiran mages. Let's just ignore they actively hunt people for &quot;witchcraft&quot; in Kul Tiras. Let's ignore that Kul Tirans distrust the arcane pretty deeply and that's why Jaina had to be sent away to Dalaran to learn about magic rather than stay home and learn. Who cares about the lore right? &quot;HERP DERP JAYNA IZ MAYJ. ALL KULTIRAN MAGE! STOOPID BLIZZ!!!!111!!!&quot; Fuck I hate how toxic the WoW community has become.<br />
<br />
Gotha love that made up lore you pulled out of your ass there m8.<br />
First of all, Jaina wasn't sent away because Kultiran distrust Arcane, she was sent to DALARAN the CAPITAL of magic to learn under Antonidas, one of the bests.<br />
Second, the witchs AREN'T using arcanes.<br />
Third, Kulirans clearly have no problem with magic since they use a that with their priest, they also have shamans and are totally fine with druids.<br />

<br />
As for warlocks I agree it should be included because warlocks aren't just about demons they're about shadow magic, curses and bazling things up. even if demoniac sect could possibly die out due to them being just few I assume that Hexxers and Pyromaniacs are not that rare.<br />

<br />
Or Zandalari have their own fighting style unaffected by Pandaren. Draenei received a background for it in Argus , Jed'hin the wrestling is now their background for monks.<br />
<br />
So Zandalari could be Jaguar warriors like Darkspears are cappoeira practicioners.<br />
<br />
Warlocks are closer to witch doctors than shaman, so I feel like warlocks aren't farfetched. I think maybe the next set will even up the class/race combos for both factions. <br />
<br />
Gotta love all the Alliance crying, thinking Void Elves should have paladins lol.<br />

Yea.<br />
<br />
And like, 3 people total play them.<br />
<br />
Also, like 68% of all WoW players are Horde.<br />
<br />
Like I said: it's &lt;NEVER&gt; enough for you guys.<br />
<br />
68%? It's nearly 1:1 right now, so check again.</div></div><hr />

To keep things fair they had to pull something. I'm actually shocked they gave a shit about being fair, since it's something that favored Horde.<br />
How is the Alliance have one more class/race option fair? <br />
Lightforged=5 Highmountain=5<br />
Void Elfs=7 Nightbourne=7<br />
Dark Irons=9 Zandalari=9<br />
Kyla Tiran=8 Mag‚Äôhar Orcs=7<br />
They should have just left locks with Zandalaris. But obviously Alliance have to get more classes and allied racials (Zandalaris and orcs only get 4 racials) for it to be fair.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is nothing lore friendly about these changes, they are just bending over backwards to cry babies.. Paladins for Zandalari should have been unlocked at a later date even patch 8.1.5 when they resolved to rezan/voljin storyline after they restored a &quot;royal&quot; loa. <br />
<br />
There is no basis for kul tirans to be warlocks or mages, Jaina literally had to move to Dalaran to study magic because she didn't have a way to learn it in KT. There is a reason why the boss in TD is titled &quot;munition's expert&quot; and not a mage even tho she is using fire spells because the team didn't want pull a mage out of their asses.</div></div><hr />

Warlock QQ is more justified. I am biased but it was on official material for over a year.<br />

And frankly paladins are less justified. Yea there's Rexan but he dies and as far as I can tell just cares about the royal line<br />

Which is a very fair argument and more than enough to disallow Zandalari Monks. Just saying they &quot;don't have access to it&quot; is a bit of a strech considering they can be shamans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But people not caring about monks is not exclusive for Zandalari trolls so you can apply that to all the other races too.<br />

And having a class you might not want doesn‚Äôt change anything. It‚Äôs still class greed when you‚Äôre calling out for all the other specs.</div></div><hr />

Oh but it's okay for Kul Tirans? They got Mage...seen people ask for Kul Tiran DK since they existed when the Lich King was in power...seen people ask for KT Paladin...they have about everything else except DH.<br />
<br />
But yeah...it's okay...it's double standards...especially since now Alliance allied races have more class options than Horde...because double standards are good when it's in your favor!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don‚Äôt know where you are coming from with all this.<br />
<br />
The fact is that people would like Zandalaries to have all classes (I don‚Äôt want to hear anything more about monks please) but I think it‚Äôs alright to leave out Warlock now that they have Paladin, Shaman and Druid. A large part of the Horde playerbase are gonna switch to Zandalari because let‚Äôs be fair, they are pretty cool. So Blizzard need to keep some incentive to play the ‚Äúregular‚Äù trolls. The Horde are already consisting too much of one class (blood elves).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thestuff1992</div><div class="date">2018-11-11, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mine is on Chilton coming back. They'll split Ion's job into two positions, and make up new job titles for each of them.<br />
<br />
That‚Äôd be fucking terrible. Chilton was worse for WoW the anyone I‚Äôve ever seen even before he was GD. He pretty much told the Paladin community to shut up about one of the worst talents added to the game that would only ever be overpowered or underpowered. He also argued about blessing of night which was removed a year later for reasons the community argued when it was introduced. <br />
<br />
Aside from that, there was practically no communication from him when he was game director. At least ion lets us know what they plan on doing and what their thought process generally is. Chilton just had others do it for him probably because he couldn‚Äôt present the selfie patch in WoD without laughing hysterically. <br />
<br />
So honestly I‚Äôd take Ion any day over chilton. While I don‚Äôt like BfA much I do like Ion for at the very least introducing more communication. I think it can be a lot better but compared to chilton it already is. A lot of bfas faults just come from trusting the systems too much. They had multiple class systems in legion that propped up the bland class design and saved it from being too terrible, however they stripped that all away going into BfA and added 1 new system which they trusted too much and it didn‚Äôt pan out which is why we have this garbage class design. They also neglected class design itself and said it wasn‚Äôt a focus for BfA. I went from hyped to skeptical as soon as I heard them say that in a post blizzcon interview. <br />
<br />
OT: Glad that Zandalaris can be Paladins. Not too happy that kul‚Äôtirans can‚Äôt. Honestly the fact they say that all these new races can be monks because they get ‚Äútrained‚Äù is ridiculous. Anyone can train another to be X class, not sure why it‚Äôs monks that get this treatment. Kul‚Äôtirans could‚Äôve been trained to be pallies during the third war and zandalaris could‚Äôve been introduced to the fel in another way. It‚Äôs dumb imo to have such harsh race restrictions on some classes when monks can be every single race because they can ‚Äútrain‚Äù others.</div></div><hr />
