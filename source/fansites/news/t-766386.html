We're very close to the release of Patch 4.0.1, at this point the only question is &quot;How close?&quot;<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, you can probably expect the patch on October 5th or October 12th. Ghostcrawler already suggested that the patch would be deployed right before the end of the arena season and added that &quot;they shouldn't have a lasting impact on ratings, titles, and the like&quot;. <br />
Since the current PvP season will end when these changes go live, they shouldn't have a lasting impact on ratings, titles and the like. We are prepared to just drop a temporary player damage nerf on all BGs and Arenas if necessary just so things don't feel too silly until everyone can level up to 85. <br />
<br />
Additionally, the World of Warcraft Trial Website (https://us.battle.net/account/creation/wow/signup/) has been updated and now announces that the new streaming client will be available on October 5th, which is exactly what we've been testing on 4.0.1 PTRs. <br />
<br />
As usual, nothing is official, but it's probably close enough. <br />

Heroic Deadmines Video<br />
TotalBiscuit released a nice video preview of the Heroic version of the Deadmines, one of the two revamped classic dungeon of Cataclysm. <br />

Currency Conversion - Calculator Update<br />
The Cataclysm Currency and Honor Calculator has been updated with the latest values of Justice Points.<br />
Weâ€™ve revised the Justice Points conversion rate for Emblems of Triumph and Emblems of Frost. When the upcoming 4.0.1 patch goes live, these emblems will be converted into 11.58 Justice Points (up from the previously planned 2.75 Justice Points per emblem). Justice Points accrued above the soft cap of 4,000 will be converted to gold at a rate of 47.5 silver per point (down from 2 gold per point) when patch 4.0.3 goes live.<br />
<br />
The original explanation thread (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=26850245012) and the subsequent conversion math update (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=26850245012&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=10#184) have been updated to reflect these changes.<br />
<br />
[...] The previous conversion rate was intended to devalue Frost and Triumph a bit to discourage some amount of farming and hoarding of points before the conversion, but then we came to the conclusion that no matter what we do people would be farming well above the softcap, and we shouldn't try to make it more difficult for them to do so. <br />

No Worgens and Goblins before Cataclysm<br />
Worgen and goblins require the activation of a Cataclysm key and will not be available in patch 4.0.3 until Cataclysm launches. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026373706/so-worgen-goblin-in-4-03-or-not/))<br />
<br />
Patch 4.0.1 and 4.0.3<br />
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying. These aren't filler patches we developed to tide players over. Patch 4.0.1 will implement nearly all systems changes necessary for Cataclysm (including class and UI changes). We've done this before every expansion to lay down the framework. Patch 4.0.3 brings about the Cataclysm, forever changing Azeroth.<br />
<br />
This has always been the plan for Cataclysm, as we've never released an expansion quite like this one before. On the one hand, this expansion offers another increased level cap with all-new leveling and end-game content. On the other hand, this expansion is virtually rebuilding the content of the entire original game from the ground up.<br />
<br />
Again, patches 4.0.1 and 4.0.3 are not offering filler content. These patches are to implement all of the new content and systems which do not require the purchase of Cataclysm. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026473210/4-0-1-and-4-0-3-the-long-wait/))<br />
<br />
Tanking<br />
Why was threat decay scrapped?<br />
We still like the idea and it might return someday.<br />
<br />
We scrapped it because we didn't think it was necessary and we wanted to focus on things we thought were necessary. We ended up changing threat modifiers quite a bit and getting rid of a lot of the threat management talents. Furthermore, Vengeance is keeping tank dps up pretty well in beta tests -- often 75% or higher of dps. Finally, it was causing a lot of concern among tanks. The intent was to make threat generation more engaging, ultimately to make tanking more fun. But I think we ended up changing so many aspects of tanking (large health pools so avoidance matters more, less AE tanking, mana mattering more, Vengeance, etc.) that changing threat on top of all of that just seemed to some* tanks to be that final straw that made Cataclysm tanking feel totally unfamiliar to them.<br />
<br />
* -- This kind of thing is always subjective. We didn't poll every tank; nor would we put a lot of weight on that anyway. Instead, we read a lot of forums and talked to a lot of tanks we knew to gauge whether this was something they were excited about or not. We know there are tanks that hated the idea and those that will be sad to see it go, as is the case with almost any design change. I offer all of that footnote just to try and stave off some of the inevitable threads that will launch from this one. &quot;Healers don't like running out of mana -- remove that. Warriors don't like rage normalization -- remove that.&quot; We welcome your opinions on all of those things, but encourage you not to search for the magic switch that will get us to change out minds in areas where we disagree. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026472493/why-was-threat-decay-scrapped/))<br />
<br />
Paladin/Warrior mastery undertuned?<br />
<br />
Increasing the value per point of mastery for paladins or warriors is not hard to do. Likewise, we might shift more of the warrior mastery between block and critical block because of the value of Shield Block.<br />
<br />
I'm also not sure we're that worried about paladins (or anyone) blocking, dodging or parrying every hit. That isn't the game breaking scenario that it used to be. If in later tiers of gear you manage to do it, probably by giving up on other stats, I'm not sure it's a huge danger. Sixty percent of damage is still a lot and none of those stats help with magic damage. In a world where two back to back normal hits could kill you, it would be a lot more valuable. In Cataclysm, it might just translate to healer mana savings. We'll keep an eye on it of course.<br />
<br />
We did change parry to scale from Strength. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026323179/paladin-warrior-mastery-undertuned/))[/blizzquote]<br />

I am not in beta nor on PTR but when I am bored I sometimes watch xfire streams and I usually see some weird things.. <br />
<br />
By that I mean 5man heroic run, where in single target boss fight 2 DPSers have each 5 - 8k DPS and then a hunter that has Survival talents (judging by explosive shot being on his bar), rotation: spam Arcane shot, when you dont have enough focus for it, spam Cobra shot. And he is doing 16 - 20k DPS with it.<br />
<br />
I mean is this going on live realms? I literally never see people doing over 10k in these fights, except for hunters, so I bealive it is intended to do something like 8k DPS at 85 in blue gear. Except for hunters :o.<br />
<br />
Now I am not complaining nor crying over it, I actually play my hunter quite a lot because we have 2 new healers on trial before cata so I can go with my alt (that being hunter).<br />

<br />
Don't go for the new streaming client - it's like changing your download software like utorrent to something else like Azureus/Vuze - just because you change the program for download, dosn't mean the content inside will change.<br />
<br />
They should have changed the way the client works in terms of the new streaming feature, but he will still do the stage pre cata downloads and on the &quot;4.0.1&quot; upgrade, it will change like the old client did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Weâ€™ve revised the Justice Points conversion rate for Emblems of Triumph and Emblems of Frost. When the upcoming 4.0.1 patch goes live, these emblems will be converted into 11.58 Justice Points (up from the previously planned 2.75 Justice Points per emblem). Justice Points accrued above the soft cap of 4,000 will be converted to gold at a rate of 47.5 silver per point (down from 2 gold per point) when patch 4.0.3 goes live.<br />
<br />
There you go.</div></div><hr />

If it's not on PTR, I doubt it'll be in live, as what's being tested is going live.<br />
Possibly in 4.0.3 (the full Cata patch) It really doesn't make sense - lore wise - to allow the new classes that come about as a result of the cataclysm before the cataclysm actually happens</div></div><hr />

Patch 4.0.3: The Shattering<br />
Shortly before Cataclysm launches, Azeroth as you know it will be changed forever. Patch 4.0.3 will bring with it cataclysmic changes to the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor. Players will be able to find new and exciting sights to see and quests to do in the level 1-60 zones, all-new troll and gnome introductory experiences, redesigned capital cities, new race/class combinations, and more! <br />

That's not what I was asking about. If the cap was staying at 4k all the way to 85, you'd essentially be wasting justice points after 4.0.3 seeing that you cannot go over the 4k cap, but you' most likely aquire some more JP raiding and also in cata dungeons.</div></div><hr />

Well if I understand it corrrectly there will be another patch after 4.01 (4.02 or 4.03?)that will not be the fullblown cata release but still introduces the changes to Azeroth with the new and revamped zones etc. After that cata will be released in full so the december prediction fits well in that time frame.<br />

Who cares, the game isn't even on life support anymore, the content is dead. It needs a rez, and even though I don't have everything done, I don't care. I'm not coming back to the game until changes are made, and these would be enough. <br />
<br />
What will be interesting is how long this means until Cata. You wouldn't think they can drag this out, but I'm sure they'll want to since they went out of their way soooo much to add those little boss battles. And they though that RS was a real raid, not just filler. Late-Nov, early-early Dec looks probable at this point. And it's needed. The game is freakin' beat, it's killed. They know they screwed up on content this time.</div></div><hr />

To me that means that the patch will come on the 12th of october. As he states &quot;Since the current PvP season will end when these changes go live&quot; its pretty much saying that the season will end the day of the patch.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are prepared to just drop a temporary player damage nerf on all BGs and Arenas if necessary just so things don't feel too silly until everyone can level up to 85.&quot;<br />
<br />
BGs will still be available to play after the patch, so will arenas (But not rated).<br />

Everything is pointing towards a oct 12th release.</div></div><hr />

if you still think december is still relevant after this, your a bit silly honestly. December won't ever come it will be November or January not in between. because December is a terrible time to release things such as Cataclysm a lot of people will be doing family stuff and most people wouldn't buy anything when christmas is so close, that's why. and also if you did read the post, or whatever 4.0.3 will be a few days before Cata not months</div></div><hr />

Thats the pount in the cap, you won't be able to build a huge amount of jp, to get a head start. And you will earn jp in cata only in heroic dungoens. And thats about the time you'll spend your jp on items anyway.</div></div><hr />

Not only that, but also it seems like a really bad idea to me to launch an expansion 10-ish days before pretty much all the staff over at Blizzard goes out for the holiday break; it would be a disaster and nobody wants to see a &quot;servers are offline&quot; message throughout that time. Even if it pains me, they should just wait til January if it's not ready for a November launch.</div></div><hr />

Of course the cost of the items get converted too. So you'll be able to buy the WOTLK items with the &quot;new shit&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I have said all along that December is a bad month to release an expansion and it therefore might be postponed to January if they don't make the November deadline. However, if believe that Boub's prediction is right (he is almost always right on these matters) then the time frame fits well into a December release.</div></div><hr />

With the early October patch 4.0.1 our Triumph and Frosts will be converted to Justice Points which buy blue gear which can't be used to level 85. You'll be making your choices based on anticipated need because anything over the cap of 4000 JPs will turn to small amounts of silver with patch 4.0.3. We'll then sit on those blues we can't wear until Cata hits and we can level to 85. Which means we run the risk of replacing them with drops, crafted, and reputation rewards.<br />

4.0.3 will go live before the expansion is released. With the 4000 JP cap this only allows you to buy 1 or 2 items once you hit level 85.....you can't buy the gear till you reach the level. The blues will be equivalent to level 85 heroic blue drops.</div></div><hr />

Frost/Triumph are being converted into Justice Points. Anything buyable with badges now will also have their costs converted into Justice Points. Level 85 blues will also cost Justice Points... so you have a choice on if you want to buy lvl 80 stuff (or primordials and whatnot) with JP or wait until Level 85 to get a head start on gear for heroics. You are thinking JP are only usable at 85 which is incorrect. This change is not that difficult people...</div></div><hr />

Patch 4.0.1 (biggest part of the patch being the changes to classes) ---&gt; Patch 4.0.3 (biggest part being the change of all the old zones but keeping the 80+ zones locked) ---&gt; Cataclysm (level cap 85 and all level 80+ content unlocked)<br />

The arena season is definitely ending on the 12th and I think he means to say since the patch goes live when the season ends they won't be affect ratings or titles. And the nerf to the bg's is to compensate for the imbalance in numbers before the damage pass that will occur once we hit 85. Using that logic expect a Oct.12th patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the early October patch 4.0.1 our Triumph and Frosts will be converted to Justice Points which buy blue gear which can't be used to level 85. You'll be making your choices based on anticipated need because anything over the cap of 4000 JPs will turn to small amounts of silver with patch 4.0.3. We'll then sit on those blues we can't wear until Cata hits and we can level to 85. Which means we run the risk of replacing them with drops, crafted, and reputation rewards.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that I patch 4.0.3 must come after folks have had time to level, right?<br />

it's been said here:<br />
- 4.0 = end of arena season 8<br />
- end of arena season 8 : october 12th<br />

<br />
What would be the point of a &quot;streaming&quot; client that you couldnt play the content till several days later? The while IDEA of the streaming client is that you can play before its all downloaded.</div></div><hr />

- Do we have a list of the new pricing on items?<br />
- What do you think would be better, spending the emblems now or wait for the conversion?<br />
<br />
I just did a quick check on the PTR, as an example, T10 pieces cost 695 and 1100 JP on there. That's the equivalent of 60.02 and 94.99 Emblems of Triumph/Frost converted to JP so it looks like stuff is the same price. So it doesn't appear to matter when you spend the Emblems you already have. However, converted Emblems are 11.58 JP each and the Heroic bosses on the PTR drop 15-16 JP each so if you plan on farming emblems/JP for any reason (for example, to buy heirlooms to level alts in Cata) it's probably better to do that after 4.0.1</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, thank you. So there isn't any reason to carry more than 345 Triumph/Frosts (345 x11.58=3995) into 4.0 because you'll be above the cap and there will be nothing that you can't already buy at the same rates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the streaming feature is not just part of the downloader and the launcher. It's also integrated in the client itself to download resources in the background and make use of them as soon as they're available. There are even bits of UI specifically added for that feature, like the additional progress bar when creating a character when the client needs to download extra data for it, etc.<br />
<br />
Even the layout of the client data files changed a lot.<br />
<br />
So they did a lot of changes to the engine, to the client to support that feature. If they were to release it before 4.0.1 it would mean releasing a streaming version of the 3.3.5 client. As such it means they'd need to take all the probably significant internal engine and resource management changes and integrate them into the 3.3.5 client, and test them, and debug them, and it's probably not worth the effort since 3.3.5 is soon going to be history.</div></div><hr />

Internal builds are further ahead than what they release on the PTR. Not saying it's bug-free, but what's on the PTR isn't the final code and fixes.</div></div><hr />

And where did you read this?<br />
<br />
Also it simply can not be on October 5th. 8 months of season 8 and then suddenly everything changes for 1 week and determines arena ranks. Even if I don't play arena anymore I think that would be completely ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't answer to stakeholders directly; they're an independent subsidiary of Activism. That said, they'd get shit for missing the Q4 release. You have to understand that the stock market is stupid. It wants quarterly profits, not &quot;gee if we wait a month our profits will be even better next quarter&quot;. From any normal point of logic this doesn't make sense, but it's the way the market works because of various factors (mostly having to do with stock brokers having neither the time nor inclination to do deep research on every company they buy and sell). <br />
<br />
Having said that, like I said, Blizzard is an anomaly because of the way they're setup. They don't answer to directly to stock holders, they answer to Activision. Right now they are some ridiculously huge portion of Activision's revenues. They would doubtless get shit from the parent company for a next quarter release, but there's not much Activision could really do about the matter. They aren't (quite) stupid enough to shoot the goose that lays golden eggs, just because it only managed silver eggs this month.<br />
<br />
Edit to add:<br />
<br />
I'm thinking this will go int two parts, Down loader client updates on Oct 5th, in prep for patch on the 12th. Realistically trying to do both at the same time would be begging for trouble. Also, while I don't personally play arena, I think arena players would have quite a legitimate reason to QQ if they changed all the talents and gear itemization for the last week of the season.</div></div><hr />

The 4k JPcap is soft until 4.0.3 and then permanent. Apparently, Blizzard likes the way pvp honor works and they don't like the way that people have been hoarding tons of badges.</div></div><hr />

I am not in beta nor on PTR but when I am bored I sometimes watch xfire streams and I usually see some weird things.. <br />
<br />
By that I mean 5man heroic run, where in single target boss fight 2 DPSers have each 5 - 8k DPS and then a hunter that has Survival talents (judging by explosive shot being on his bar), rotation: spam Arcane shot, when you dont have enough focus for it, spam Cobra shot. And he is doing 16 - 20k DPS with it.<br />
<br />
I mean is this going on live realms? I literally never see people doing over 10k in these fights, except for hunters, so I bealive it is intended to do something like 8k DPS at 85 in blue gear. Except for hunters :o.<br />
<br />
Now I am not complaining nor crying over it, I actually play my hunter quite a lot because we have 2 new healers on trial before cata so I can go with my alt (that being hunter).<br />

Yes and No. You will get JP from heroics and you will be able to buy T10 from it. But you can't buy all T10 with 4000 JP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I also am one of thoe who really doesn't want the patch now. Rather have the whole thing in one go when Cata launches and have everything to explore, instead of in 3 parts. I remember when the WOTLK prepatch was launched during TBC, how ridiculously OP everyone suddenly became and how lame the game felt, no matter how &quot;short&quot; the period was between that patch and the actual launch of WOTLK - even though I was at that time really excited about the class changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only mages using arcane explosion are arcane mages (wonder if even they will use it) and they will be the last to whine, because they can talent an extra 80% reduced threat for arcane explosion what other classes/specs cant. ^^<br />
<br />
Tanking as a druid will suck, because they are the only ones with 1 ae tankskill until 81, that can even miss, be dodged or parried.</div></div><hr />

The trial account streaming client is not the same as the full version launcher ... that is being enhanced in 4.0.1 with play while downloading feature. While I do suspect the trial account client update will take into account many changes and aspects of 4.0.1, I would be very hesitant to state that an update to the Trial account client is for certain simultaneous with the patch 4.0.1 being applied to Live. <br />
I thought blue posts were that Arena Season 8 would end ( no earlier than 12 October ) and the titles/mounts awarded before 4.0.1 patch. If this were to still hold true, Patch 4.0.1 could be after October 13th, but likely the 19th or later.</div></div><hr />

Edit: Yeah I know this is a little different since its an expansion patch and is a MAJOR reworking of the mechanics. But it shows that a patch is not required to end an arena season.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowyld</div><div class="date">2010-09-30, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, usually there is a &quot;release&quot; after the build number. This *may* be an interesting exception, though, since the PTR build is, essentially, the same build as Beta (with content switched off). If the Beta client is not labeled for &quot;Release&quot;, I don't know if the PTR client will be.<br />
<br />
And, no, the streaming would not need to launch early. The point of the streaming client is that you can install it and run the new files with little download time. <br />
<br />
I am not saying it will launch this coming Tuesday, but if it does not, it will definitely be next, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

As far as I can remember they've only ever done a week-delayed patch for the EU for 3.3.5, using US as the guinea pigs to make sure LFD didn't destroy the servers. Still, if they deplay 4.0.1 a week late for the EU I'll be a very sad panda :(</div></div><hr />

Actually both the US and the EU site either say &quot;soon&quot; or &quot;October 13th&quot; depending what language you use. Just click through the diifferent options.</div></div><hr />
