At BlizzCon 2013, we shared a lot of our ideas for Warlords of Draenor’s Garrisons. We knew early on in development that this feature would strike a chord with long-time Warcraft players going back to the RTS days, as well as set the tone for the conflict with the Iron Horde. Since BlizzCon, we’ve been experimenting and iterating on Garrison concepts in our design laboratories, and we wanted to give you an updated preview of what’s to come.<br />

<br />
In this 4-part series, we’ll be giving you a much closer look at how Garrisons are shaping up and how you can expect to interact with them in Warlords of Draenor. For this first installment, we’re going to start off by painting a picture of Garrisons in relatively broad strokes, setting the stage to delve into the functional depth over the coming weeks in parts 2 through 4.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Establish Your Garrison While You Level<br />
We want the process of staking your claim on Draenor to fundamentally shape your gameplay experience. Over the course of building your Garrison, we want you to face exciting decisions that will meaningfully impact how you interact with the world around you, fulfilling that fantasy of building and operating your own Warcraft base.<br />
<br />
The story you weave in Draenor is one of personal heroism, but your actions have a wider impact—part of your mission is to raise an army capable of toppling the Iron Horde, and the Garrison is integral to that experience. In terms of gameplay, that means you’ll be creating and strengthening your Garrison as you journey to level 100. While questing through Draenor, you’ll encounter opportunities to choose between different types of buildings to add to your Garrison. Each choice will have an impact on your leveling experience, influencing the quests you’ll have available and the zone-specific benefits you’ll unlock upon completion of your chosen structure.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/thumb/gar03.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/gar03.jpg) <br />
<br />
As an example, you can choose either the Lumber Mill or the Sparring Arena while questing in Gorgrond. Not only does this choice unlock the design blueprints that allow you to add the building to your Garrison, it also lets you construct a military outpost centered around that building in Gorgrond. This plays an integral role in how you experience the zone, as you’ll be sent on quests specific to the building you’ve chosen and will receive a permanent benefit whenever you’re in Gorgrond. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/thumb/garr04.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/garr04.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/thumb/garr05.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/garr05.jpg) <br />
<br />
When you’ve completed constructing a building in a zone—and subsequently unlocked it for your Garrison—we want you to feel duly rewarded for helping to strengthen the forces in the area against the Iron Horde. To give you more of a feeling for the ideas we have for zone benefits, imagine summoning a brutish ogre bodyguard from your Sparring Arena when in Gorgrond, or calling down artillery strikes from your Armory while in Talador. Our goal is for each zone to offer equally compelling alternatives from which to choose, and to provide you with plenty of powerful creatures to vanquish with your newfound powers.<br />
<br />
Enlist Followers to Join Your Garrison<br />
Your Garrison wouldn’t be much of a base without some citizens to populate it—we call these brave souls Followers. You’ll be able to recruit Followers through a wide variety of methods—you can think of it sort of like collecting mounts or battle pets. And, like battle pets, different Followers will have varying skill sets, including their own strengths and weaknesses. Some Followers are unique and might even have names already familiar to you, while others will make for fine grunts to operate the saws of your Lumber Mill, brew potions in your Alchemy Lab, or craft magical components in your Enchanter’s Study. You can maximize the productivity of your Garrison by assigning specific Followers to the posts where which they’re most proficient, such as Johnny Blacksmith, who will increase the output of materials from—you guessed it—your Blacksmith when assigned to work it. Similarly, Followers more suited to combat would be ideal to send on missions, from which you can acquire an assortment of useful bounty.<br />
<br />
Missions will have variable difficulties, durations, and group size requirements, and some will play better to the strengths of particular Followers over others. A wise commander will create the ideal team for a mission and send them off to reap the maximum rewards. Complete enough missions and your Followers will level up, and once they’ve reached level 100, they can continue to improve their item levels, abilities, and traits. After you’ve sent a group on a mission, progress will continue whether you’re hanging out in your Garrison, battling through Blackrock Foundry, or even sleeping soundly logged out of the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/thumb/garr06.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/garr06.jpg) <br />
<br />
The buildings you create, NPCs you meet, and Followers you recruit will ultimately determine who inhabits your Garrison, and you’ll see them going about their business each time you visit. You’re in charge of your own base and citizens, and you’ll even host leaders and other notable heroes from your faction to talk war strategy—among other things.<br />
<br />
We’ve also improved NPC AI (artificial intelligence) to further reinforce that “bustling town” feeling as you expand your Garrison. While Azeroth’s NPCs have traditionally been manually scripted to move along set paths for predetermined amounts of time, stopping at certain locations and then heading in new directions only as commanded, this behavior wouldn’t have sufficed for Followers. A particular Follower might need to know on which plot within your Garrison you’ve built your Trading Post, for example, so he or she can make the trek to and from that specific location while doing your bidding. This improved AI also allows us to create more dynamic behavior, where NPCs can react to your commands or other situations happening around them. Want to have your subjects join you in a conga line around town? Thanks to improved AI and a new player emote, you can . . . and they will!<br />
<br />
Fortify Your Fortress<br />
Questing during the leveling process on Draenor will be the primary means by which you establish and grow your base, but the blueprints that allow you to construct different buildings can be obtained in a variety of ways. For example, you can find Followers who will teach you blueprints, obtain them via drops from creatures out in the world or in dungeons, or earn them via faction reputation. At level 100, you can also purchase blueprints from a vendor for the buildings from each zone you originally didn’t choose. So, if you decide to build a Mage Tower instead of an Armory in Talador, you’ll still be able to purchase the blueprints that allow you to build an Armory in your Garrison later on. From there you may decide you want an Armory instead of a Mage Tower in your Garrison—or maybe you’ll find room for both!<br />
<br />
You’ll have access to 21 unique building types in all, each of which can be upgraded through 3 levels and then assigned specializations to maximize their effectiveness, and your Garrison can be expanded from its initial 4 building plots to a maximum of 10. If this sounds like too many big choices to make as you go along, don’t fret! You’ll be able to alter your building choices to suit your needs—and the needs of the war effort.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/thumb/garr07.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/garr07.jpg) <br />
<br />
The Garrison also grants you other powerful benefits. It will play an integral role in your professions on Draenor, giving your character access to more than just the normal two primary professions (we’ll cover that in more depth in part 2 of this preview series). In addition, amassing a powerful army of Followers will maximize your chances of earning mission rewards like dungeon and entry-level raid loot for your character—but these will be tuned to feel more like bonuses rather than eclipsing your character’s direct accomplishments. We want there to be a ton of depth to the gameplay and customization of the Garrison, but we also don’t want to make players feel like they’re required to spend more time than they’d like laboring away on it after they’ve reached level 100. We recognize that there’s a fine line between introducing a system that provides cool bonuses and adding “chores” that feel necessary for cutting-edge endgame progression. To this end, players who prefer to level up mostly through dungeons or Battlegrounds will still be able to purchase the building blueprints that would otherwise be obtained through questing on Draenor.<br />
<br />
The Last Line of Defense<br />
Draenor is a savage and dangerous land. From the moment you set foot onto its soil, you will be hounded at every turn by the united clans of the Iron Horde. With few allies at your side, establishing a well-defended base will be one of the first orders of business. As the story unfolds, you’ll find that Garrisons are intimately integrated into every zone—whether you choose to follow the main quest path or just head off into the hills to explore, you will meet allies (and enemies) in every corner of the world. While your main fortress will always be in Shadowmoon Valley (Alliance) or Frostfire Ridge (Horde), you will establish Garrison outposts in Gorgrond, Talador, Nagrand, and Spires of Arak, all customized based on your building choices. Eventually, your forces will span the continent, and you will have an army capable of assaulting the fortified Iron Horde Foundry. Will your troops succeed? That’s entirely up to you, commander.<br />
<br />
More to Come!<br />
Thank you for joining us on this quick tour of your Garrison, and we hope you’ll come back for the rest—we’ve only just scratched the surface of this exciting new feature. In Part 2, we’ll take a much closer look at the buildings, including all 21 unique building types and their perks and specializations, as well as how professions are integrated. Stay tuned!</div></div><hr />

I loved the farm in MoP, this is like a bigger version of that<br />
<br />
See, I ignored the farm because I found it boring, and this really is like a bigger version of it.<br />
<br />
If you liked it, great, I know a few people who really enjoyed it and I'm happy for them, but the fact that garrisonsto be the linchpin for WoD is a little dissapointing for those of us who didn't give a shit about the farm.<br />
<br />
Still fuck it, I'll just ignore it as much as I can I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two things; What WildStar is doing is actual player housing, this isn't not an attempt to create player housing, so that's comparing apples to oranges. 2: WildStar needs to do something that is bigger and flashier because it's a new game, and not a 10 year old, very established game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
makes sense; because targeted vs aiming ... whether it be Wildstar or Tera vs WoW or SWtOR or Rift ... The action combat, positional requirements, and moving out of the way of stuff to not get hit is much better combat engagement than ... click/tab target, spam abilities.<br />
<br />
Which you prefer is personal; the level of attention and need to avoid is much higher in the action based, aimed ability combat, than targeted stuff.</div></div><hr />

Garrisons will be loved by some; ignored by others. Think making it too integral, which also increased development time, was a goof imo.</div></div><hr />

I'd love to land at my garison on my pally and see my mage chilling there too.<br />
<br />
yeah that would be totally awesome! stepping inside the tavern and seeing your alts just chilling having a beer</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except if you don't wanna touch it until 100, you don't have to. If you don't want to touch it at all, you don't have to. Just like pvp, dungeons, scenarios, etc. <br />
<br />
If you ABSOLUTELY have to use EVERY avenue for gear, then it's mandatory, but then, so is everything else they put in the game with a player power reward, which is pretty much everything but pet battles and achievement points.</div></div><hr />

But after reading this article, I am starting to realize that this really be a feature that transcends a singular feature. <br />
<br />
I was disappointed at first to learn they stripped the idea of a Garrison in every zone, but am ecstatic to to learn they will carry forward that idea in some way with the customizable posts. <br />
The concept is really shaping up nicely, and I am really looking forward to learning how the NPC rangings and professions are tied into it. Sounds like it has real potential.<br />
<br />
Anyone comparing this to the farm and saying they won't like it because they didn't like the previous hasn't read this blog, and likely hasn't even done the farm. <br />
The farm is meant to be a way to obtain some extra resources, and there is slight story associated with it. Its fundamental for the Tillers reputation and story. There were zero npcs that did anything inside the farm, no one else could visit it, and it is quite tiny. <br />
The Garrison appears to be a way to obtain way more resources from a lot of different means, contains actual NPCs, pve events, and customizable full size buildings. Especially considering there will be components involved with leveling and in each zone, I can't see how anyone could even remotely compare the two. Its like comparing a phone to a computer. It does every the previous did, but has 100x more features! It even has its own UI!<br />
<br />

<br />
But assuming I really don't like simple management games, there's very little to get excited about regarding garrisons. The gathering of resources from the farm and garrison will work the same way, ultimately, except instead of planting a seed you tell and NPC to do something. Maybe the time needed to wait will be different, but that's pretty much it. I have zero interest in visiting or inviting anybody to my garrison.<br />
<br />
I used the farm for maybe a couple of weeks and got bored, I honestly think the same will happen with the garrison, beyond the mandatory levelling crap.</div></div><hr />

Actually, you are incorrect.<br />

They have stated NUMEROUS times that Garrisons, at least to some extent, are mandatory for leveling your character towards level 100. HOWEVER the mandatory parts of it will be a lot easier than the optional parts that will add a lot of the better perks.</div></div><hr />

1. Is it going to be a menial daily task of having to spend 10 to 30 minutes making sure everyone is doing what they are supposed to do in there? The farm was 16 little plots and that thing got tedious and boring fast. I stopped using it mostly because of that even though it remains one of the most efficient ways to obtain raw materials of any kind.<br />

So much time and effort into something that could have been much cooler. Ever since the early days, people dreamed about player housing. Interacting with other people, building a guild house together, showing off rare items etc. Instead we only get more impersonal instanced stuff... Scenarios, pet battles, proving grounds(whats it called) and now this... They are alright features, but I feel like they really just missed some great opportunities to implement something bigger and a lot more social. This game really does need more social.<br />
<br />
A once big MMO, where working together was quite crucial (leveling back in vanilla/tbc required some teamwork), granted instances could be a pain, but often worked out and you found a lot of new friends doing so not to mention the respect for just spending that time with other random people. And you had 20-40 man raids. (not saying we should go back to 40). Now everything you do is solo, things are instanced and phased. You're playing a single player game where sometimes you group up to do something (instanced), not at all what I expected this game to be after all these years.<br />
<br />
Only one thing that has remained top-notch in this game, that is raiding. Also the reason I stayed all these years. If they ever fuck it up, that will definitely be it. In the meantime I will enjoy some landmark and wildstar till this silly expansion comes out. 20 man ftw!<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents, sorry for the rant.</div></div><hr />

Whatever floats your boat, I suppose. <br />

I guess it's just a problem with the template they've chosen. If they'd just called it housing or something along those lines, nobody would expect the more action-oriented things that would usually come alongside garrisons / fortresses / battlements.</div></div><hr />

Yes they do. You will be attacked by Enemies that you encountered while leveling and you have to defend it, or your followers can handle it. And no, you don't have to drop what you are doing to defend it. A garrison is a base basicly, a center of operations, RTS's if you get my drift.</div></div><hr />

Wildstar housing can be either &quot;useful features&quot; or &quot;cosmetic customization&quot; or both... e.g you can build a Festival that gives you food etc [you raid the picnic tables!].... garden etc... or Skate board [lol]. Anything you want.</div></div><hr />

Actually, they've said they're integral to the leveling experience. That means they're an inherent part of the story and gameplay in the zones. That's different than &quot;mandatory to advance from level 90 to level 100.&quot;<br />
<br />
Did you read the post? They even address this.<br />

To this end, players who prefer to level up mostly through dungeons or Battlegrounds will still be able to purchase the building blueprints that would otherwise be obtained through questing on Draenor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't like that. I had no interest in Garrisons before. I figured I would construct one somewhere on the other side of the continent and forget bout it. But now they are limiting the garrison to one location and are forcing players to use it as part of the questing. I don't like to feel &quot;forced&quot; to do something that I don't want to do. Hopefully I only have to do it on one character so I can ignore it on my other characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn´t read it that way. Seems more like &quot;choose to build something here (two options given); whatever you choose to build you get the blueprints&quot;. Then, with that blueprint you can build that structure inside your garrison. If later decide that you wanted the other blueprint you just have to buy it. The 1st one you chose to build will remain out in draenor providing some kind of buff in the zone they are placed.</div></div><hr />

Yeah? Last week they still hadn't fixed the combat lag or the animation problems. Did they fix that? I wasn't able to log in for a little test today, due to work. The combat is also less responsive then WoWs, so not sure why you think it's better.

And and well Rift did customizable player housing before Wildstar so the same could be said that Wildstars devs stole the idea of player housing and so on from Rift and every other MMO before them.. In the end everyone borrows ideas from everyone else..</div></div><hr />

Maybe wildstar will fail, good possibility. But the combat is better and will always be better that WoW.<br />
<br />
That's like your opinion man...<br />
<br />
I preordered Wildstar and am enjoying the beta but I personally feel the combat is a bit messy and over the top, it's quite fun but I will always prefer WoW, it just feels more solid while Wildstar feels like a free for all. Comparisons between combat systems and player housing are like apples and oranges in the case of WoW and Wildstar, imho.</div></div><hr />

Weird. My title bar says &quot;MMO-Champion - World of Warcraft News and Raiding Strategies&quot;; what's yours say? There's a reason the site itself has only single sub-forums for other games: they aren't the focus of the site, despite the name of the URL.<br />
<br />
OT: I like the Garrisons okay I guess. Some cool ideas but I'm pretty ambivalent overall though. I'll probably do it on my main, then half-ass it on my first few alts and then don't do it at all on my later ones, just like I did with the farm.</div></div><hr />

For those who have many alts (like me) farm was a nightmare to manage and boring too.<br />
<br />
Then why did you do it? Mats were easy to gather in the world. I never understand people like this. ´I find this boring and it offers no reward, it sucks doint it on 14 alts´.<br />
<br />
I thought the Farm was boring also after I got all the little friends maxed and opened everything up.. so guess what.. even on my main I never planted just to plant. Once the quests were done ( about a month). i just didn´t do it. I have no clue how anyone would do it on alts unless they really enjoyed it. It takes like 2 minutes to get a stack of ore from the world. less time than getting it on your farm.</div></div><hr />

You'll either play WoW or Wildstar. Hell, maybe even both with Wildstar's ability to pay with in-game currency. But still, they are not comparable the way people keep comparing them. Wildstar doesn't interest me personally but I hope it does well.

Not only does this choice unlock the design blueprints that allow you to add the building to your Garrison, it also lets you construct a military outpost centered around that building in Gorgrond. This plays an integral role in how you experience the zone, as you’ll be sent on quests specific to the building you’ve chosen and will receive a permanent benefit whenever you’re in Gorgrond.<br />

Always the same shit. Fanbois of new mmos hail them as the pinnacle of challenge, and when those new mmos come out they learn that they're just as easy as any other mmo aimed at making a profit so they shut up...<br />

I'm still hoping that they'll change their mind on being able to move Garrisons at max level. *really REALLY wants one in Nagrand* Perhaps the new outposts they were talking about will kind of work for that? You'd still have to go to the main Garrison to place buildings and all that, but maybe we can do everything else from the outposts so we can 'choose' where we spend most of our Garrison time at? *shrugs* As for the buildings, I'm hoping that we can get racial buildings but I'm sadly not holding my breath. I'll love all of the Orcish buildings on my Orc, but I'd rather not have Orcish buildings for my Tauren Druid or my Blood Elf Mage, y'know?</div></div><hr />

I don't think the location will be a big problem but I agree with the rest. Horde has Goblin and Blood Elf on their side with amazing architecture and engineering but they go for orc. I guess they gotta follow a theme. Maybe they will pleasantly surprise us. But an Orc armory is not the way to do it. Maybe they are just further along on the alliance side. But their garrison looks epic. Or maybe there is a conspiracy to get more people to play alliance #jk #notjk</div></div><hr />

I'm not impressed either. At first it felt exciting, until Garrisons got driven into the spotlight 24/7. I'm getting sick of the almost daily news bulletins on Garrisons from Blizzard (that's how it feels like, at least). It might sound stupid, but I'll probably look even more forward to WoD if they could just stop talking about their Garrisons for a while. I like to have Garrisons as 'that extra special thing' in WoD, just like the Farm in MoP for example, but I don't want to get it shoved down my throat all the time :p</div></div><hr />

I hope it's more than that, but we'll have to see. That's one of the reasons I despised some of the questing and 'unique non-questing'(cough, bullshit, cough) aspects that Wildstar is pushing. Good game in other aspects, but they failed on making 'non-questing' content feel more than just glorified 'kill x amount of this' or 'collect y amount of that' challenges, with only a few decent ones sprinkled about...<br />
<br />
So, they set the bar pretty low for Bliz, yet, I hope Garrisons goes above and beyond expectations. It's looking good so far, and I'm glad Garrison's are going to effect your experience in zones.</div></div><hr />

That's my biggest problem with it. I know it's only the first part of four, but we already knew the overwhelming majority of this.<br />
<br />
My other huge issue is that they've yet to show any of the Horde architecture. Considering that's what I play, I'm really quite frustrated by this.<br />
<br />
All told, however, I lost interest when they decided against racial buildings. I've never played a human or orc, care little for their politics, and so don't want my Forsaken warrior, tauren shaman or draenei mage running around in their areas.<br />
<br />
It's supposed to be my base.<br />
<br />
Well, a skellie would never build a set of shitty orc huts as a base.</div></div><hr />

PS - have you really seen the player housing in wildstar, its mediocre at best.<br />
<br />
Mediocre? You're able to place 800 different things OUTSIDE and INSIDE your house. You've so many different skins for the house, the area and everything else, along with customisible size of everything that I stopped counting.</div></div><hr />

This will be forgotten and neglected just as farms are now. I don't understand the reluctance to give us an ACTUAL housing system after 10 years.You should pay attention then, they have said over and over, the reason they haven't done &quot;player housing&quot; per say is that it adds no gameplay. It removes players from the game world for no reason. They said they would do player housing when there was a system in place for it, that allowed for progression of the character and the house.<br />
<br />
In other words, they played games with player housing in it and thought it was stupid.</div></div><hr />

But now over time I find myself more and more wondering if it'll just be another grindfest like the &quot;Base&quot; in the Firelands which we were expanding back in the days of Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
With the info given so far it sounds like we will more or less have to establish outposts in every Zone rather than being able to place and construct a Garrison at a random chosen Point as it was announced at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
Also as to the Style of things ... I dont see why a Nightelf for example would build buildings in the way the Humans build them in Stormwind. Same goes for Bloodelves on Horde, Tauren, Trolls etc ... I know it is a lot asking and that it wont happen anyway, but it would be nice to be able to select different styles of buildings.<br />
<br />
Lets hope that as we get more info, there will be more clarity on what it is actually going to be. Until then, lets hope it isn't going to turn into the Blizzard typical grindfest, but actually will be an immersive and fun part of the game.</div></div><hr />

But they still want to believe that they are so representative of some fictional majority to justify what is simply throwing a tantrum over not being the sole audience of mummy blizzard's attentions.<br />
<br />
They said that you would not be required to start from scratch on subsequent characters, though I think each may still require some work, just not the whole thing again.<br />
If you are going to reap the benefit on multiple characters it is only fair that you don't get it all for free.<br />
<br />
Eagerly awaiting the professions detail, since that is another part people chose to whine about, despite a clear statement of &quot;LIMITED access to professions&quot;, not intended to replace any profession at all.<br />
<br />
Yeah I know they said that, and I will more then likely do it. just saying that if it was only one then the choices one make would be bigger, even if you can switch buildings. But with I'm guessing two chars, you can have it all making the choices more of a &quot; what do you want first&quot;. Also hope they make leveling followers take a long ass time. And that they will go over the early raiding gear they mentioned in this part 1 with a very hard and gear dependent follower group needed and like a long time to complete this quest etc. But they got sooo many ways they can go with this. They just need to decide where to start :P Gonna be good, hopefully from the start^^</div></div><hr />

For me, walking around in my own fort will be ´cool´ but that will last a brief amount of time.. Similar to how ´rearranging´ my house in Wildstar got boring really fast... or how barbarshop in WOW got old the first day. Yes, it sounds really cool to be able to spend all day playing sims and changing the skin of your house.. but it isn´t gameplay that lasts within an MMO. It isn´t minecraft, the options you have available are limited in WS housing. A few players will be able to do some neat things.. but for the most part, it will just be like custimized housing in UO.. you will spend a day or two playing with it, then you will put it how you like it, then it is no longer gameplay.<br />
<br />
The real fun gameplay for me, and I hope this is how it actually works at lvl 100 and for the months and months after we are lvl 100, is forming groups and raids with my followers and having a bunch of different groups all going out on different missions. Raising and equiping your followers so that you can form a 40 man raid with your own followers. To me, managing a large number of followers and forming groups with them each day depending on what missions I want them to play.. that is gameplay.</div></div><hr />

TBH to me so far it sounds more like the usual Blizzard Grinfest, following the usual Blizz motto of &quot;Grinding will keep players in the game&quot;. As I had said in my previous post, I was excited at first but with what little info they gave so far it sounds like it will boil down to the typical Grindmarathon.

There are two things though, that dont really make a lot of sense with that ...<br />
<br />
1) Blizz would basically be saying &quot;We think its stupid so we dont give a shit what players think&quot; (Not going into how many would actually enjoy it or loathe it, just more a point of the attitude)<br />
<br />
2) There is not that much difference if a player would be removed from the game while being in his or her house rather than idling in Org or SW while waiting for the next LFG or LFR q to pop.</div></div><hr />

Of course Blizz is making the game the way they want it to be, that is after all their right to do so. It's their pond and we're just swimming in it. But that doesn't mean that everything they do is good, nor does it mean that players can't have differing opinions.<br />
<br />
As to idling in Org or SW ... I dont do it either, I have better things to do with my time than sitting around bullshitting.

Of course they can't win, it's impossible to please everyone and they should really stop trying to do so. I'm glad they're taking garrisons in the direction they want to but that doesn't mean I have to agree with it. As far as garrisons affecting leveling, I highly doubt it will be much outside of a couple quests for each building and they will be side quests. If they're going to sit there and talk about how awesome garrisons are and how they will affect leveling in a meaningful way then I hope they go all out and prove me wrong.</div></div><hr />

You do actually have a good point there ... the way they are doing this means that after the expansion the Garrison is obsolete, unless the next Xpac will also play there. So this great new feature which will improve our game immersion and gameplay so much will be utterly useless once the next Xpac comes out.<br />

I didnt say the game was bad or will suck because of Garrisons, I even let the hope there that as we get more info it will make it more clear as to how it will all go down. As of right now, I can only form my opinion on what I have heard so far and yeah ... that itsn't extremely favourable to the Garrisons, at least not as much as it was back when it was mentioned at Blizzcon. I wouldnt go as far as <br />
saying the majority of things they did over the years were good, but there were enough good things to keep me playing the game ;)<br />
<br />

Where as other games add items to their housing overtime I imagine this will be dead after the expansion. I recently noticed that they do planned obsolescence for every major feature. I'm still playing and enjoying the game, but it makes me sad that this huge world isn't really a world, every expac there are just more and more rails added.Yes, because, there has never been a feature besides guild leveling. Hilarious. I don't feel you even need to know the rest of the features that people use everyday in wow. You really are hopeless.<br />

You do actually have a good point there ... the way they are doing this means that after the expansion the Garrison is obsolete, unless the next Xpac will also play there. So this great new feature which will improve our game immersion and gameplay so much will be utterly useless once the next Xpac comes out.Unless they implement garrisons into the next expansion too, since the system for it will be in place. Garrisons v2.0. Like how the farm is in garrisons now.<br />
<br />
It's weird, everything I'm saying seems obvious to me, why do you guys not do some research before making rush judgements?</div></div><hr />

Their reasoning of &quot;working it into the leveling flow&quot;, is pure bullshit, because last I checked, there are 6 other zones players will be leveling in... Once again, Blizzard is taking away the player's option to play the game a way that suites them, and forcing them to play the Blizzard's way. This is simply another example of laziness on their part. Instead taking a little more time to make quality content that more people will enjoy, they just cut a bunch of stuff, and rush it. They did the same thing with Path of the Titans, because they realized they took on more then they were capable of. That concept was amazing, and would allow for so much more uniqueness to the game. Instead, they just changed the talent tree to &quot;avoid avoid cookie cutter builds&quot;, which failed, because damn near every class have the exact same talents. /rage.<br />

Which is how they'll work it into the leveling flow, but doesn't solve the main problem that you still can't choose what zone your Garrison is in. <br />

(In short, I agree that this solves the problem Desareon is complaining about, but doesn't solve any of my problems with garrisons :()<br />

*shrug* It'll be a worthwhile and useful feature for the expansion pack. However, it will not be: <br />

2) Aesthetically customizable <br />

Except nothing of what they've shown moves anything about MMOs forward. This is just the Blizzard version of player housing as much as they try argue otherwise. Just like when they said they would never do a wardrobe system and then the expansion after that we got transmog. Except MMOs are already plodding past what this is offering for instance the Warplots of Wildstar or the outrageous customization of Rift. This is basically just a preset system where you get an option A or on Option B. It's the illusion of choice with an optional grind attached to it that neither positively nor negatively affects end-game. <br />
<br />
It's a non-system. It's pointless and it's a mediocre waste of time and development hours.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkwarrior42</div><div class="date">2014-05-28, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So unless something is customizable, then you don't like it. OR you heard &quot;player housing&quot; when they said &quot;garrisons&quot;. That's what I get from you. No? What if it's not like the farm, what if it is better?<br />
<br />
I heard player housing when they explicitly said that garrisons would be WoW's answer to player housing. That was their wording at Blizzcon. I will not apologize for being disappointed that their &quot;answer&quot; to player housing has exactly zero of the features I would consider most important to player housing. <br />
<br />
As for being better than the farm... depends on how you define better. I fully expect the mechanical advantages to be &quot;better&quot;, just as I expect the gear in the higher level zones to be better than the gear in the lower level zones. <br />
<br />
And if the relative lack of customization means I don't like it on its own, I would have quit WoW a long time ago, as the entire game is defined by a lack of customization compared to pretty much any other MMO on the market. The catch is, the lack of customization doesn't stop raiding from being fun. It doesn't stop a lot of aspects of the game from being fun. But Garrisons are supposedly all about you building your base on Draenor; the invasion is &quot;up to you, commander.&quot; Except, the building looks however it looks, and your only customization options are mechanical... that's not necessarily bad design, but it's not an answer to housing. <br />
<br />
Also keep in mind how cooking worked with the farm in MoP. The farm wasn't bonus materials; it was a source that Blizzard fully took into account when balancing how many materials various recipes took. Granted, their balance wasn't perfect, but it wasn't &quot;go gather materials the normal way, and here, have the farm on top of that.&quot; The farm was a calculated and known variable. <br />
<br />
I fully expect Garrisons to be the same way. Garrisons will grant plenty of mechanical benefits; of that, I have no doubt. However, I also expect that Blizzard will take those benefits, and any resources they grant the players, into account when designing resource requirements on recipes and the like. So intelligent use of the Garrison won't give you a bonus, any more than using a flask or a talent does; it will bring you up to the level that Blizzard has balanced around. From that perspective, I cannot get excited about garrisons giving me mechanical benefits any more than I can get excited about new gear. <br />
<br />
Functionally, the only thing I've seen so far that looks like it's actually going to be a nice addition is the ability to send your followers out on missions to get stuff for you. That does, however, depend on what they can get you; if they just bring back standard materials, then even that just becomes a much fancier version of planting seeds and waiting a day for them to grow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And we won't be controlling a bunch of units at the same time into combat, so I still don't see the reference. Unless you are talking about the Conga line throughout your Garrisson.<br />
Blizz have decided to have the Garrisons in a sort of Warcraft style and that part of the whole thing makes perfect sense to me. If it doesn't make sense, then there would be way more things in the game that dont make sense at all before that one would even find a spot on the list.</div></div><hr />

No it is player housing. It Is WoW's player housing and as such it should be compared to other games player housing.

But look at the people who did, read this article, the guy calls it player housing, but notice the Blizz rep never once says it is player housing: He actually says that player housing in other games doesn't make sense.<br />

True, but it would be nice if my Shammy could at least have her own room and not have to share a place at the inn with the common townsfolk. OMG what a horrendous scenario that is, having to sleep in a sommoners bed that had god knows who already lying in it. I think I'm going to faint, Fanman quick, I need a fan.Actually I think there will be something like this in garrisons, the thing is... there is one in the farm too, and no one goes there. Why? because it is too far from your city of portals. (That is why the garrison in the starting zone makes sense, you'll see).</div></div><hr />

<br />
And they really, really should have just said that from the beginning. They said it was their answer to player housing to get people excited; the downside is that when it became obvious that it's not housing, all the people that got excited by the idea of having housing at long last became disappointed. <br />
<br />
Of course, I'm also annoyed that I'm going to be stuck in a bunch of Orcish architecture for another expansion, in the ever so lovely and enjoyable Frostfire Ridge, so I'm sure that is coloring my opinion.

<br />
See, I ignored the farm because I found it boring, and this really is like a bigger version of it.<br />
<br />
If you liked it, great, I know a few people who really enjoyed it and I'm happy for them, but the fact that garrisonsto be the linchpin for WoD is a little dissapointing for those of us who didn't give a shit about the farm.<br />
<br />
Still fuck it, I'll just ignore it as much as I can I guess.<br />
<br />
I feel ya man. I only did the farm because I felt I had to and was to cheap to buy mats off the ah. I had to level my cooking and make my own food for raids before someone was able to supply the team with feasts. After that its been rare that Ive even touched it. <br />
<br />
The concept of garrisons sounds cool on paper i just really feal its going to be another fail implementation on their part. THEY will think its great im sure.<br />
I really hope this doesn't take away from 5 man content design or other areas of the game that need improving STILL.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marakesh</div><div class="date">2014-05-28, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a veteran WoW player I get quite sad at features like this. So much time and effort into something that could have been much cooler. Ever since the early days, people dreamed about player housing. Interacting with other people, building a guild house together, showing off rare items etc. Instead we only get more impersonal instanced stuff... Scenarios, pet battles, proving grounds(whats it called) and now this... They are alright features, but I feel like they really just missed some great opportunities to implement something bigger and a lot more social. This game really does need more social.<br />
<br />
A once big MMO, where working together was quite crucial (leveling back in vanilla/tbc required some teamwork), granted instances could be a pain, but often worked out and you found a lot of new friends doing so not to mention the respect for just spending that time with other random people. And you had 20-40 man raids. (not saying we should go back to 40). Now everything you do is solo, things are instanced and phased. You're playing a single player game where sometimes you group up to do something (instanced), not at all what I expected this game to be after all these years.<br />
<br />
Only one thing that has remained top-notch in this game, that is raiding. Also the reason I stayed all these years. If they ever fuck it up, that will definitely be it. In the meantime I will enjoy some landmark and wildstar till this silly expansion comes out. 20 man ftw!<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents, sorry for the rant.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This. Last year, one of the main devs said that he wouldn't have done much different in the development of WoW, except he thought they had forgotten it was a social game and needed to get that back. So, I keep checking sites like these every couple months looking for something to change, but instead all I see is more solo mini-games. This might be a great feature in a single player rpg but I don't understand why people are paying full game price plus 15 a month for this. I guess we have different tastes, but I still don't get it. If you don't raid in the more hardcore mode there are already numerous f2p games that are better quality than this, and w* may take that last strong point away as well.</div></div><hr />

“Player housing from other games is very cosmetic,” he said, citing examples from other MMOs that let players “set up drapes” or rearrange carpets but little else. “In WoW, we really want to make sure that there’s a reason to do it.” That is at Blizzcon, way back in the beginning. I don't think you were actually listening.<br />

<br />
yeah they should have said it was more of a player base than housing.<br />
<br />
not all horde buildings will be orcish. the mage tower will most likely be blood elf. i think they said something about few buildings will be from other races for both sides.<br />

Actually in that one I have to disagree...Chilton said in the first panel &quot;This is the World of Warcraft version of Housing&quot;.

&quot;What is a garrison. Garrison is the ability for you to build your own base on Draenor. This is the world of warcraft version of Garrisons. This is not some cottage that exists in a far away corner in an instance that is not in the world, this is your ability to actually build a base, almost as you do in the RTS games, in the actual world that you will be able to see as you fly through the zones... etc...

Unless they implement garrisons into the next expansion too, since the system for it will be in place. Garrisons v2.0. Like how the farm is in garrisons now.<br />

It's weird, everything I'm saying seems obvious to me, why do you guys not do some research before making rush judgements?<br />

Ok to go on then for you, pet battles are seeing no upgrades come WoD. Transmog is not being expanded, there are items people want to use and still can't for it. Glyph system which was originally supposed to be expanded upon has not been touched. I just think its funny you take what I said as what seems like a personal attack, very defensive words and all. I have my opinions you have yours. Get over it.</div></div><hr />

I never heard of legendary pets that we would get, items that are not transmoggable is a whole different thread having nothing to do with WOD, and glyph system was reduced because, people would have complained that archaeology was now required to do, so they made archaeology optional and just gave us glyphs. These are not reasons why WOD and garrisons will suck. Are they?<br />

Garrisons might be a different change of pace, but the fact is, it looks basically the same, but on a grander scale.<br />

At the end of the day, it doesn't affect your leveling nor you need to look to it.<br />
<br />
Uh, actually it DOES affect your leveling. Blizz said so.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">finskee</div><div class="date">2014-05-28, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty much lost all interest in this feature after I've heard there's only one theme you can get, and that you cannot place it outside your starting zone. Hope they will work on that. I really don't like the Horde starting zone by the looks of it, and I was never a fan of the orc theme.There is a very simple reason for this. You're garrison works best if it is by the main city, near the portals. You'll see.<br />

<br />
My only problem with the optional is, what if you don't want to do the garrison stuff, but also don't only want to level through dungeons, etc? <br />
<br />
I'm only speaking for those that that might be a thing. It also seems like you have to do this if you want anything other than dungeons/raids.<br />
<br />
Me personally, I'm excited for garrisons, but I can see peoples' complaints on the subject.<br />
<br />
You however, seem to constantly think anyone who disagrees with garrisons and voice their opinions on the subject are idiots. You sir, are the worse one of the two, being closed off to other opinions. Not only positive opinions need to be voiced.<br />
<br />
OT: Loving the whole concept of having outposts and constant feeling of growing larger. Throughout the expansions we've become bigger and better heroes of the Horde/Alliance, and now finally we are becoming commanders of armies. RP boner.</div></div><hr />
