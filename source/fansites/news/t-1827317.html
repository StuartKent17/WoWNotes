WoW Americas Regionals $100,000 Prize Pool<br />
Two teams have already qualified for the World of Warcraft Arena Americas Regionals later this year – one from North America, and one from Australia &amp; New Zealand. As we wait to learn who will be joining them from the Latin American Championship and North American Cups 2 and 3, we wanted to take a moment to share some exciting news about the Americas Regionals prizing!<br />
<br />
This year, teams who advance to the Americas Regionals won’t just be competing to earn a spot at BlizzCon, they’ll also be fighting for a share of an epic prize pool of $100,000. That prize money will be distributed among the 8 qualifying teams as follows:<br />
<br />
1st place team: $50,000 2nd place team: $20,000 3rd place team: $10,000 4th place team: $8,000 5th-6th place teams: $4,000 7th-8th place teams: $2,000 <br />
<br />
We’re extremely excited about this year’s Road to BlizzCon, and can’t wait to share all of the details on the Americas Regionals (including when and where they’ll be happening) with you soon. Good luck to everyone competing!<br />
<br />
<br />
Recent PvP Rewards Hotfix<br />
Looks like both changes made it in for maintenance today. All of the Wild Gladiator's armor pieces should now be available on the Conquest vendors, and there is no longer a 200-point Ashran restriction on the weekly Conquest cap.<br />
<br />
So, slightly technical details here, but for those who are asking:<br />
<br />
The issue with the Accolade trinkets is that there's actually just one item per primary stat (Strength, Agility, etc), which has a secondary stat randomly assigned when it's looted. We can't, for example, put the Int/Versatility trinket on a vendor, because that item doesn't actually exist -- there's just an Int trinket that can randomly have Versatility added to it.<br />
<br />
This means we don't have a way to implement a non-random method to get them via hotfix. We'd need to add new versions of the trinkets to the game, and that requires a content patch. I don't know yet if that can happen in time for 6.2.1.<br />
<br />

For me, this was the other way around. Paragon one was really boring, Method was fun due to chatter and better POVs. <br />

They got the world 1st and they had the right to add their chat and nerdscreams and the epic music and everything. Good call from Paragon to keep it toned down imo. Just the kill.

Crap music that didnt go with the vid at all and at the end showing the skip cinematic then just ending it was amature at its best...at least show the end game cinematic.....pure lazy, i guess the salt got real!<br />
<br />
Then your taste in music is awful. I didn't get anything out of Method's video, but Paragon's videos have always been great as has they choice in music. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm I think method video is waaaay better the intro + music + the nerdscream at the end = very epic video kill</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know good videos is not only about music yes Paragon video music is great but Method video is waay better in term of intro and PoV I could see clearly in their video compare to paragon's video (I am talking about the last extra mythic only phase). And the nerdscream at the end alone what made it even more epic.</div></div><hr />

I facepalm as people cant understand this....why would Paragon make a epic video coming in second? And specially if they put it up the same day as Method? Dont you guys think they talk amongs the guilds? Jesus ofc Methods video was more epic, they got the kill. Next time if Paragon gets it their video will be more epic.</div></div><hr />

Yes I agree with you but what surprised me the most that some people say paragon's video is way more epic.. I mean come on really?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea i dont understand that either, i mean its flat for a reason but still flat. And ofc i know they can make epic videos but in this case they had to take the backseat, i just like the respect between guilds shown with this kill video realese.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's just the base spell tooltip. It has one charge at base, and when you take the talent it increases the max charges to two.</div></div><hr />

i do hope is just that, the few buffs after the huge drop of single dps at start of wod for enhancement shaman make me worry on every new hotfix i see the phrase &quot;enhancement shaman&quot; that a strange nerf will appear and squeeze us like worms down to the dps ranking :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only way to pressure pet class defenders in RBGs is to try to blow them up, and that's not going to happen with a Vanish &gt; Envenom that never crits.<br />
<br />
I agree, if they are going to nerf it 40% would be better. Only a 10% chance for a 4 set bonus......I mean I know I can kill people within 3 seconds sometimes but c'mon. In fairness though at least they didn't take away the crit bonus completely because that would of hurt my soul.</div></div><hr />

Ursa Major increases your maximum health by 2% for 25 15 sec. When this effect is refreshed, the remaining portion is added to the new effect. Druid - Guardian Spec.<br />
<br />
The most pointless Druid change ever, seriously changing it to 10 seconds less !!!<br />
and you wonder why the expansion sucked ass.<br />
<br />
IMHO they have too many specs and could churn them down a notch to like 2, there's no difference in Protection and Retribution except a change in weapon also you can make Holy into a Warlock summoning attacking class with a change of weapon.<br />
<br />
Druids could have 3 specs due to lore, Druid of the Flame, Claw and Talon and go nuts etc etc.<br />
<br />
What's seemingly holding them back is pvp and the restrictions of the game, come on Blizzard gives us specs that make us feel like level 100 not level 10!!!</div></div><hr />

Seriously, well played to them!<br />

As for the buffs, I still don't see it in game. At least it's not written in the grimoire.</div></div><hr />
