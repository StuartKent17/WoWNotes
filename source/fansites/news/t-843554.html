Halfus Wyrmbreaker spawn cycle<br />
Ever since the release of Cataclysm, people have been posting on the Raids &amp; Dungeons forums each week to ask what the spawns are for Halfus Wyrmbreaker. Our lovely and awesome Simca (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/545200-Simca) eventually started Theory: Halfus is not random (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/841742-Theory-Halfus-is-not-Random) to see if we can predict the encounters for the upcoming weeks. <br />
<br />
The answer is yes, the add rotation is fully known and verified and unless Blizzard hotfixes something, you should now be able to plan your raids accordingly. (The naming scheme is the one from the original post, that's why the week # aren't in the right order)<br />

Al'akir Heroic World 2nd Kill by Paragon Video<br />
Paragon (http://www.paragon.fi/) released a video of their world 2nd kill of Al'akir in 25-man Heroic Mode! Hopefully this one will make people slightly less angry than the Nefarian videos. <br />

Why? Not even Blizzard separates them anymore. Same lockouts. Granted, the difficulty aint necessarily the same, but who cares?</div></div><hr />

<br />
being honest. 10man is way harder than 25man (for al'akir, before anyone gets on my junk). paragon themselves even stated it. i think it's quite generous that they're being put in the same grouping.</div></div><hr />

His list seems to be wrong, somehow. Simca's actual list in the forum has Slate, Nether and Storm last week, correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you say that with a straight face while knowing that Method &quot;exploited&quot; twin dragons with grounding totem and that pretty much every top guild glitched Atramedes in some way? I'm not supporting Paragon's way of killing Nefarian either, but this way of flagging Paragon as CHeaTaHz while glorifying Method looks ignorant.</div></div><hr />

Huh ... I could be wrong because Simca wasn't around to double check, but I'm not sure what the problem is. You're on US Realms, you had Slate/Nether/Storm last week. <br />

snip snip for picture<br />
<br />
I think the confusion lies in the dates. You have those listed as April when it should've been January 25th to Feburary 1st.<br />

Unless I'm missing something...which I think I am.<br />

<br />
Talking Alakir specific probebly yeah, but there are a few 10-man bosses on HC mode that are quite alot harder.<br />
<br />
Mostly because 10man doesnt have the ability to swap 1 dps for an extra healer, since thatll gimp your dps too much etc.<br />
Think halfus hc, we cant bring more than 3 healers and 2 tanks, otherwise we just suicide</div></div><hr />

People QQ when Blizz used a 'take the class' approach to things. Then Blizz said that they want people to 'take the player' in Cata and people QQ about that. Then people QQ when one fight is tilted in the favour of one class.<br />

Indeed.<br />
I mean 10 man and 25 <br />
- Have the same mechanics<br />
- Drop the same loot<br />
- Have the same lockout<br />
<br />
But yeah because paragon said that 1 boss from 13 is harder on 25 than 10 because of the platform scaling let's say that 25 is harder than 10 in total.<br />

He/They could have easily pulled any &quot;top&quot; guild out of their rears to paste in there really, but Paragon is known pretty well lately. Relevance is not always the point. Making sure your audience gets the reference is.<br />

When I get GB, why the hell can't I have tanks who quit!? Most of the ones I get who stick are like... not tanks. Like... half geared or not geared but &quot;LOLZ I HAS TANK SPEC&quot; types. :&lt; I'd at least rather see real geared tanks. (AKA I at least am trying to show I can mitigate.)<br />

Not every boss have the same mechanics in 10 and 25. Some skills only happens in 25.<br />
<br />
Clueless people is clueless<br />
Stop embarassing yourselves in Cata the bosses are using same mechanics on 10man and 25man normal and heroic.<br />
And maybe this will come as a shock to you (judging by your deep knowledge of the game) but they drop the same iLvL loot.<br />

<br />
Here's the breakdown on Cata Content. All bosses are assumed to be on Heroic.<br />
<br />
Halfus: Harder on ten man due to raid stacking requirements. Must have a mage, probably need either a 3rd tank or a 4th healer, If lacking a mage, you need multiple paladins and multiple spell based interrupts if you're alliance, if you're horde, you need to socket a pvp meta gem into an orc.<br />
<br />
Double Dragons: Harder on ten man. Adds spawn at the same rate, and do the same damage as on 25 man, and up until a hotfix a week ago, they even had the same 310k health pool. Players are far more likely to get instagibbed in ten man.<br />
<br />
Acendant Council: Harder on 25 man due to geometry.<br />
<br />
Cho'gall: Harder on 10 man due to having the same number of adds to deal with, despite the adds being overtuned on ten man.<br />
<br />
Sinestra: No one has seen her on ten man.<br />
<br />
Conclave: Harder on ten man. Sleetstorm does the same damage despite 25 mans having tons more people to soak it.The Wind shield has the same 150k health pool on both difficulties. Adds are much harder to control on ten man.<br />
<br />
Al'Akir: Harder on 25 man due to geometry.<br />
<br />
Magmaw: Harder on 10 man due to 10 mans being incapable of devoting a 5 man team to kiting adds, which have the same spawn rate as in 25 man, and still get any meaningful DPS on the parasites, much less the boss.<br />
<br />
Omnitron: Much harder on 10 man due to interrupt requirements, and the probability of instagibs going through the roof because all the abilities hit as hard as they do on 25 man.<br />
<br />
Maloriak: Harder on 10 man due to poor tuning on the adds. 1.3 mil health on 10 man per abberation? Seriously blizz?<br />
<br />
Atramedes: Equally broken and exploited on both difficulties.<br />
<br />
Chimaeron: Much harder on 10 man due to the nature of the second phase.<br />
<br />
Nefarian: No one has seriously pulled him on 10 man. At least 3 guilds have downed him on 25.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unkn0wnerr0r</div><div class="date">2011-02-02, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People really need to calm down, I mean if they beat that boss with X amount of classes because the boss takes extra damage from Y ability then who cares? Think of it as a bosses weakness, like a boss in Zelda who takes extra damage from say a Fire arrow or bombs, etc.<br />
<br />
They were not banned for it so it is not an exploit, just a Strategy.<br />
<br />
Well the problem is that for so long blizz has been on this &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; rant. It gave many of us hope that some of the less desirable classes/specs would be welcome in things. Yet they completely reversed this with the absolute need for CC when not every class/spec has reliable CC. Further they pushed interrupts, but failed to give every class/spec a viable interrupt. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love the need for CC. I love the need to interrupt. The problem is when pushing those things blizz reversed themselves and made it so some classes are more desirable, and some classes are simply not welcome. They are trying to fix that now, but it's pretty much too little too late. They should go back and make sure they keep the need for interrupts, and crowd control. They should also add in a baseline interrupt/CC for every class. That way it's independent of spec. Similar to how they are doing Rebuke. There you go, now no matter who you get, you have CC and interrupt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Wind shield has the same 150k health pool on both difficulties. <br />
<br />
Al'Akir: Harder on 25 man due to geometry.<br />
<br />
Maloriak: Harder on 10 man due to poor tuning on the adds. 1.3 mil health on 10 man per abberation? Seriously blizz?<br />
<br />
Atramedes: Equally broken and exploited on both difficulties.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think Wind shield has 450k health pool on 25hc! So if you are correct and 10 man has 150k health it's quite less ;)<br />
<br />
ALakir: Its not easier because of the geometry of the plattform, but more so because of the Lightning strike ability. It does Damage equally to the players in the zone. So in 25 player raids the Lightning strike will always do 3 times the damage than in normal mode. That's why paragon did phase 1 with only 17 players in 25man-man!<br />
<br />
Molariak: You know you get a 100% dmg increase buff when attacking the abberations?<br />
10 man total: ~~21million health (abberation HP)<br />
25 man total: 45 million health<br />
<br />
Atramedes: If you try Atramedes hc without running out in the air phase or stunning the boss infinitly the difference between 10 and 25 hc mode is actually very significant! The air phase gets easier the less people you have (if you did try to boss seriously on heroic you know what i mean..)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding the 10 player and 25 player discussion:<br />
Most people who defend 10 player are argueing that it &quot;might&quot; be harder because there are less dead 10 hc bosses than 25hc (exept for alakir : 25hc kills: 5 // 10 hc kills: 6)<br />
But what most people forget is: No Top 20 guild IS going 10 man! Only on Alakir to abuse the 10/25 shared achievments on wowprogress!<br />
Im sure if all top guilds would go ONLY 10 mans instead we would have zero 25 man hc kills on further advanced bosses...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The wind shield got retuned with the same bunch of hotfixes that took down the health on maloriak and Theralion's adds. <br />
<br />
The issues are with the ratio of DPSers to add health. Prior to the hotfixes which saw abberation health nerfed on both difficulties, 10H had 1.8 mil, and 25H had 2.5 mil per. This pretty much restricted 10 man attempts to dragging the fight out 17 minutes due to the bugged enrage timer. I mistyped the health value in my inital post. <br />
<br />
As for atramedes, pretty much everyone either used the infinite stun or the run into the ring strat for their kill, but I can see how the geometry helps in the air phase, it's the most broken fight of a poorly tested tier, and that's saying quite a lot.</div></div><hr />

You need 2 people with interrupt. A rogue/warrior/DK/shaman :/ It's not hard in 10man.<br />
And why the fact that abilities hit as hard as on 25man make it harder? You don't have less HP on 10man... If someone doesn't move out of fire/with debuff/from poison or hits shielded Electron, it's a wipe regardless of raid size.<br />
It'd say that this fight is easier on 10man. Even Ensidia killed it on 10man before going 25-mans, and before any other guild killed it on 25man.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclave: Harder on ten man. Sleetstorm does the same damage despite 25 mans having tons more people to soak it.The Wind shield has the same 150k health pool on both difficulties. Adds are much harder to control on ten man.<br />
Do you have any proof that Sleet Storm deals the same damage on 10man and 25man? Because I don't believe that.<br />
<br />
And the shield: ...<br />
<br />
The wind shield got retuned with the same bunch of hotfixes that took down the health on maloriak and Theralion's adds. Are you saying that the Storm Shield (spell ID: 95865) was reduced on 25man from 450k to 150k? It's hard to believe... <br />
And it's not true...<br />
I just checked our logs from 26th January: the Storm Shield on Rohash on 25man heroic absorbed 459866 damage before going down.<br />

I'd dare to say that it is pretty much unneeded in heroics. I haven't met any tanks, competent or otherwise, that I could pull off of as long as I was attacking a target he was focused on. In the rare case I ever get close, my character portrait flashes and if I have sound on then I hear the &quot;you have too much aggro&quot; sound.<br />
<br />
I guess what I am saying is that Blizzard's default threat notifications have turned out to be more useful than I originally thought.<br />
<br />
This might not always be the case as DPS might start outpacing tanks in the next raid tier of gear, or they nerf tanks to the ground.<br />
<br />
I barely even look at Omen in raids now because our tanks are competent and we are all around the same gear level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the only real answer to the question of separating 10s and 25s. Blizzard doesn't separate them, they are on par difficulty wise, just because we went through a whole expansion separating 10s and 25s does not mean we need to now.<br />

You are not Blizzard employee.<br />
I don't like merging rankings of 10mans and 25mans, because they are different encounters.<br />
<br />
Blizzard said: &quot;We want them to be on similar difficulty&quot;. <br />
They didn't say: &quot;They are on similar difficulty&quot;.<br />
<br />
And they are NOT on the same difficulty.<br />
I don't need to prove that every encounter is different on 10man and 25man. <br />
I just need to show one example to validate my point: Al'Akir is much easier on 10man.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Merging the rankings forces guilds to raid 25mans, because we gain more gear on 25mans, and we can downsize to 10man when it's profitable.<br />
<br />
2. Merging rankings forces 25man guilds to guess which encounters are easier on 10man and downsize on them.<br />
<br />
3. Merging rankings forces guilds to have two raiding teams: one for 25man and one for 10man.<br />

The only guilds that matter when it comes to rankings are the handful of top guilds who make a living playing WoW.<br />
<br />
For the typical WoW player, it doesn't matter if you are #4, #7, #12, or #20 to down an encounter, and it doesn't matter if it is 10-man or 25-man. The distinction only matters if you are trying to justify a paycheck or endorsement.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has said loud and clear that they want to make 10-man and 25-man raiding as similar as possible, with regards to both effort and reward. In reality it is obviously not possible to perfectly balance the two, but overall there is no longer a major distinction between the two. It is just a matter of personal preference of how you want to raid.</div></div><hr />

For the typical WoW player, it doesn't matter if you are #4, #7, #12, or #20 to down an encounter, and it doesn't matter if it is 10-man or 25-man. The distinction only matters if you are trying to justify a paycheck or endorsement.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has said loud and clear that they want to make 10-man and 25-man raiding as similar as possible, with regards to both effort and reward. In reality it is obviously not possible to perfectly balance the two, but overall there is no longer a major distinction between the two. It is just a matter of personal preference of how you want to raid.<br />
<br />
As he is a member of Method, i would assume that the rankings are important to him, which was his point.<br />
Now does it matter for the rest of us? of course not. I'm happy having cleared 10/12 on normal for the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paragon gets free computers and such, but they all do have real jobs.<br />
<br />
I wasn't sure if the top guilds got enough in terms of endorsements to supplement their income or even be a sole source of income.</div></div><hr />

I don't like merging rankings of 10mans and 25mans, because they are different encounters.<br />
<br />
Blizzard said: &quot;We want them to be on similar difficulty&quot;. <br />
They didn't say: &quot;They are on similar difficulty&quot;.<br />
<br />
And they are NOT on the same difficulty.<br />
I don't need to prove that every encounter is different on 10man and 25man. <br />
I just need to show one example to validate my point: Al'Akir is much easier on 10man.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Merging the rankings forces guilds to raid 25mans, because we gain more gear on 25mans, and we can downsize to 10man when it's profitable.<br />
<br />
2. Merging rankings forces 25man guilds to guess which encounters are easier on 10man and downsize on them.<br />
<br />
3. Merging rankings forces guilds to have two raiding teams: one for 25man and one for 10man.<br />
<br />
We don't like it, we don't want it.<br />
<br />
Notfur &lt;Method&gt;<br />
<br />
I agree with Method. Paragon should be recognized for their world first 25-man kills.</div></div><hr />

And why the fact that abilities hit as hard as on 25man make it harder? You don't have less HP on 10man... If someone doesn't move out of fire/with debuff/from poison or hits shielded Electron, it's a wipe regardless of raid size.<br />
It'd say that this fight is easier on 10man. Even Ensidia killed it on 10man before going 25-mans, and before any other guild killed it on 25man.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you have any proof that Sleet Storm deals the same damage on 10man and 25man? Because I don't believe that.<br />
<br />
And the shield: ...<br />
Are you saying that the Storm Shield (spell ID: 95865) was reduced on 25man from 450k to 150k? It's hard to believe... <br />
And it's not true...<br />
I just checked our logs from 26th January: the Storm Shield on Rohash on 25man heroic absorbed 459866 damage before going down.<br />
<br />
The report: worldoflogs.com/reports/fwmlyxsrvdxhbqyy/details/0/<br />
<br />
In ten man, if you got Magmatron and Electron up at the same time, you could get a shadow condutor+Security Measure+Chain Lightning combo, and with potentially less than 1/3 of the healers than a 25 man would be carrying, someone is garunteed to die. If a DPSer dies, that's 20-25% of your DPS dead on that fight. If that was one of your interrupters that died, then you're stuck praying for a non hit capped tank or resto shaman to cover his interrupts, and things go downhill very quickly when arcanotron comes up. There's more redundancy built into a 25 man raid group. Your whole initial interrupt team could be wiped out, and you'd have to have a very strange raid comp to not be able to slap together another one on the fly from your DPS. Not to mention on the AoE heavy components, being pretty much garunteed to have an aura mastery/DG/PW:B for each security measure is a godsend, and 8-10 aoe heals fill up people faster than 3-4 even after taking the cap into consideration.<br />

<br />
They very much DID get recognized, as the first person to down 25m HC. But they werent the first to down him, plain and simple. Blizz said they came in second, so they came in second, their world their rules. Live with it.<br />
<br />
As for the 10/25 argument, if one fight makes u say 25s are harder, then Cho'gall being harder on 10s makes them harder? The hard part about being a 25m guild is finding 25 people who can and will show up and perform to their best, and thats where the difference ends. The encounters are ridiculously similar this expansion, and i credit Blizz for that.</div></div><hr />

Fantastic you guys were going to get them despite the size. I care about the average player in the average to above average raid guild. If the differences are glaring between 10 and 25, then 25 will finish first and out gear before 10 man ever does. The next tier will come out and the 10 man guilds will be under geared and behind 25 man guilds. This makes people want to move from a 10 man guild to a 25 man. Lets face it not everyone wants to do it the hard way all the time.<br />
<br />
Didn't Ensidia start in 10 then go back to 25 because they hit a wall in the race doing it in 10 man? Also, it might be good to remember that the way the top 3 guilds do things isn't the &quot;right&quot; way, its the quickest way; its a race. So when paragon only stacks 17 for a phase you might want to think about that not as they had to do that to win the fight, but they did that so that they could win the fight before anyone else did in 25. <br />
<br />
I firmly agree though this has been the most untested, lazy, and unpolished level of Raid content yet. I think this is the first expansion that blizzard didn't live by their motto &quot;Its done when its done.&quot; Maybe because Ruby Sanctum was trash and people were bored so they released before it was done, maybe it was fear of all the new MMOs coming out while everyone was Wrath bored, or maybe it was that Christmas money they wanted, but all in all badly tuned set of content. Maybe just poorly tested but for sure badly tuned all around.<br />
<br />
Still playing and still having fun, but disappointed that there is so much bonked at release. Been a strictly 10 man raider all through Wrath, did both in BC, and did a fair amount of raiding in Vanilla, more ZG than anything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's pretty much the same scenario that we had at the start of BC. On the BC Beta, the only 25 man encounter that was beta tested was Gruul. Death and Taxes got on the beta, prepared for the fight like they did any fight in Naxx, and breezed through it in a few hours. So, two weeks before release, Blizzard completely retuned all the raid content, with no testing. The result was the worst batch of raiding in the history of the game.<br />
<br />
It's the same thing with ten mans here. Guilds like Modest, which is basically a bunch of Exodus raiders, came at the ten mans like a progression guild should. They shredded everything on the beta, and in response, blizzard knee jerk equalized all the abilities between 10 and 25, and have been slowly working on retuning the 10 mans to where they wanted them to be.<br />
<br />
Basically, 25 man guilds are doing T11 raids, 10 man guilds are reliving some of the worst aspects of early T4-T5 raiding. The only thing we're missing is a 45 minute respawn timer.<br />

10 is not the same experience as 25 thus should be looked at as totally separate brackets as far as heroic modes or any of the completion achieves go.<br />
<br />
That way guilds can be seen as their appropriate bracket any judgments aside on difficulty cause blizzard should be tirelessly working to make em close to equal as possible and probable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FattyXP</div><div class="date">2011-02-03, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the problem is that for so long blizz has been on this &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; rant. It gave many of us hope that some of the less desirable classes/specs would be welcome in things. Yet they completely reversed this with the absolute need for CC when not every class/spec has reliable CC. Further they pushed interrupts, but failed to give every class/spec a viable interrupt. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love the need for CC. I love the need to interrupt. The problem is when pushing those things blizz reversed themselves and made it so some classes are more desirable, and some classes are simply not welcome. They are trying to fix that now, but it's pretty much too little too late. They should go back and make sure they keep the need for interrupts, and crowd control. They should also add in a baseline interrupt/CC for every class. That way it's independent of spec. Similar to how they are doing Rebuke. There you go, now no matter who you get, you have CC and interrupt.<br />
<br />
They do not intend the &quot;bring the player&quot; message when its on heroic difficulty, which is the only time when class choice is of almost any importance.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymrohd</div><div class="date">2011-02-03, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a significant risk of differences between 10man and 25man. Imo it all comes down to two things in the end though. Fights were a flexible raid combo is required will favor 25man significantly. Fights were spatial constraints are important will favor 10man significantly. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, 25man needs to be tuned slightly harder as long as there are multiple raid utilities available that are not bound by limitations. Blizzard recognized the importance of combat rez and limited them. What about other important cooldowns though? A 25man raid will naturally have access to more raid mitigation cooldowns (Divine Guardian, Power Word: Barrier), more strong raid wide heals (Tranquility, Divine Hymn), more mana regen (Mana Tide totem, Hymn of Hope) and has a far easier job in fielding full standard buffs and debuffs (even with all the changes, a 10man raid would still need to pick specific combos if all raid buffs and debuffs are to be available).<br />
<br />
Moreover while many people in forums seem to obsess about how the hardcore guilds are progressing in raids, I think it is peculiar to assume that this is the intent of the majority of players in WoW. Blizzard has actively shown that they want to provide raiding content for the majority of their playerbase. I personally am inclined to believe that hardcore progression is simply not intended in WoW design. Especially in this tier, because of lack of gating, the guilds striving for world ranking would face encounters at quite lower levels of gear than intended. Obviously they would need be creative with raid composition. I am not saying that there are not significant bugs and tuning issues in this tier; this is a mess we have not seen since the large beta raid tests started in PTR for 2.1. Still the problem may partly be in people pushing content faster than expected.</div></div><hr />

As a University Student, it's utter easy. And guess what? 18-25 years old people are mostly student in Occidental Europe (and even more of them in Scandinavia, where Paragon is from). Myself as a student went out of college for 6 months in the middle of my 3rd year and still graduated at the end of the year (like a boss). If you add the current unemployement rate of your country to students and part-time workers, you're done. You have people available enough.<br />
