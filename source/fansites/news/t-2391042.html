Warfront Testing (Horde) - April 17<br />
We're getting ready to begin our first round of public testing for the new Warfronts feature in Battle for Azeroth, and we'll need your help!<br />
<br />
On Tuesday, April 17, starting at 1 PM Pacific time (4 PM Eastern, 10 PM CEST), we'll be enabling the first Warfront for testing. To participate, you'll need to be on a Horde character and head to Zuldazar City, where you'll find a small table you can click on and join the Warfront queue.<br />
<br />
We'll be running this test for about 3 hours, and will be watching and participating ourselves, so we hope to see you there! <br />
<br />
<br />
Voice Chat Now Available for Testing<br />
Voice chat in the Battle For Azeroth Alpha is now enabled and ready for early testing and feedback.<br />
<br />
You'll find the voice chat controls along the left side of the text chat window, and you can configure your devices and push-to-talk in the Voice Chat section of System settings.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to post your feedback on this new feature here in this thread.<br />
<br />
It's worth noting that voice chat should currently only be available for players in a party channel.<br />
<br />
We'll post here with any notable changes as we test. <br />

Windwalker lost Effuse?<br />
Windwalker/Brewmaster will have a basic castable heal as before. It should be back next build. Probably will be called Vivify and not Effuse, to be consistent with the Mistweaver changes so far.

They just wanted to ensure that there was no way whatsoever this mount's faction and race affiliation could ever be questioned or missed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's used for the felbat, the rare drop argus demon mounts, and the Antorus raid mounts, as well as being visually similar in stature to the gronnling and yeti mounts.<br />
<br />
Now I get why blizzard is reusing the rig and animations, but it's a very specific body shape that they're using for several different mounts. Which makes it a little tiresome, especially when the forsaken bats have never used the armed model before. Frankly, I think they should have done a recolor of the store mount. <br />
<br />
A hippogryph is just going to look and fly like a hippogryph.</div></div><hr />

It is a Horde mount. Gotta have spikes on spikes.<br />

Add in few goth candles for Forsaken aesthetic.</div></div><hr />

Checked ingame. There's 9 hippogryphs. On the other hand there's 19 talbuks and 27 drakes.</div></div><hr />

No we don't, that looks like a PVP mount. We get a pretty hippogryph.</div></div><hr />

Alliance will get another steed probably. That hippo is too cool to be just an event mount</div></div><hr />

Yes, it's not a new model, but it's still a new mount model.<br />
Even if it got an update, we've had the hippogryph since what, TBC?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's actually back because of pending lawsuits against game companies for not making their games voice accessible. Way back they were able to argue that it wasn't a reasonable accommodation (voice chat was quite rare in games) but now that voice chat tools are so prolific, developers are required to implement some level of support or be in violation of the ADA.</div></div><hr />

Void elves have me playing Alliance for the first time since Worgen.. The models for the Kul tiran druid forms, the norde/celtic old world aesthetic, it's all right up my street.
