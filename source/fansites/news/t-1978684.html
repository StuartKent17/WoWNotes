Legion - Mythic Dungeons<br />
In Legion Mythic dungeons will scale in difficulty and rewards, making them relevant throughout the expansion. Most of what we know has been covered in the blue posts (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/407625-feedback-mythic-mythic-dungeons/), but to recap: <br />
<br />
<br />
Each level of difficulty increases the health and damage done by enemies in the dungeon by a percentage. <br />
<br />
Level 1 (8%) and Level 2 (17%) Mythic Dungeons have no affixes.<br />
Level 3 (26%) to Level 5 Mythic Dungeons have one affix, selected from Tyrannical, Bolstering, Raging, and Teeming.<br />
Level 6 (59%), Level 7 (71%), Level 8 (85%) and higher have two affixes, selecting from the previous four and adding Necrotic, Volcanic, Skittish, and Decay. <br />
This blue post (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/407625-feedback-mythic-mythic-dungeons/#post3) has the full list of valid affix combinations. <br />
<br />
There is a 45 minute timer that you must beat to advance to a higher level, but not to get loot. <br />
When keystones upgrade, a new dungeon is selected at random. <br />
The Mythic+ dungeons are only limited by keystone availability, not a weekly loot lockout. <br />
Players are suggesting new affixes on the forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1977331-Affixes-Make-your-own!). <br />

<br />
<br />
Decay - All players lose 1% of their max health every 2 sec while the challenge is active.<br />
Skittish - Enemies pay far less attention to threat generated by tanks.<br />
Volcanic - While in combat, enemies periodically cause gouts of flame to erupt beneath the feet of distant players.<br />
Necrotic - All enemies' melee attacks apply a stacking blight that inflicts damage over time and reduces healing received.<br />
Teeming - Additional non-boss enemies are present throughout the dungeon.<br />
Raging - Non-boss enemies enrage at 30% health remaining, dealing 100% increased damage until defeated.<br />
Bolstering - When any non-boss enemy dies, its death cry empowers nearby allies, increasing their maximum health and damage by 20%.<br />
Tyrannical - Boss enemies have 50% more health and inflict up to 30% increased damage.<br />
<br />

Order Hall Follower System<br />
I completely understand the concerns. What you're currently seeing in Alpha are bits and pieces of a system that is still coming together, untuned and often even inconsistent between classes, without additional context. And as a result, there's also a fair bit of misinformation floating around (for example, the cap on active champions/followers is 6, not 20). We haven't published a full explanation of the system, because we're still working out a few of the details - that's the nature of Alpha. And of course in the absence of information, seeing an interface that looks a lot like a reskinned version of what you're used to in Draenor garrisons (followers -&gt; champions, garrison resources -&gt; order resources, etc.), it's easy to assume that this is just a continuation of the old system.<br />
<br />
I'd like to at least shed light on some of our goals and philosophies, and the core ways in which Class Order missions in Legion are going to be very different from garrison missions in Warlords. The mission system in Warlords was conceived as a core part of the garrison experience, and a self-contained progression that offered rewards that competed with other traditional content. <br />
<br />
We approached Legion unsure whether there would even be any continuation of mission gameplay at all. We focused instead on the artifact and class order systems, creating traditional content to provide the experience of forming a band of the greatest champions of your class to combat the Legion, with an eye towards class identity and replayability. We want your journey through the Broken Isles to feel meaningfully different in at least a few key ways depending on whether you are a mage, a warrior, a demon hunter, etc. <br />
<br />
Once we had the backbone of our order systems in place - a campaign quest arc wherein you recruit champions to aid your cause, and an order hall tech tree where you research upgrades - we saw what seemed like a good fit for a version of the old mission gameplay to provide another outlet for leading the champions you've gathered, and spending the order resources you've earned out in the world. But it is far more limited in scope, and designed to be a much smaller piece of Legion than missions were in Warlords - it's serving a larger system, rather than trying to stand alone as a system in and of itself.<br />
<br />
There are fewer followers (champions), fewer and less frequent missions; but more importantly, the system is more closely tied to the game world itself. Order resources come from playing the game normally, and will come primarily from doing World Quests at max level. If you get a &quot;raid mission,&quot; it won't give you a piece of raid loot directly; it will give you a quest to kill a specific boss in that zone, in exchange for a bonus piece of loot. In general, from the ground up, missions in Legion are not intended to be an alternate progression path, or a self-contained activity. We don't think of them as &quot;content.&quot; But they are a useful additional outlet to complement core traditional content, such as dungeons, outdoor questing, and raids.<br />
<br />
We'll have more details to share in the future, but hopefully this helps clarify some of our broader goals and provides some context to what you may be seeing in game.<br />

Raid Testing Issues<br />
Obviously we've been experiencing significant technical issues. We've been trying to diagnose them, but they're beyond the scope of anything that can be addressed in the short-term (infrastructure/back-end issues, as opposed to just a simple code bug that can be fixed). As such, we're canceling today's tests. They'll be rescheduled.<br />
<br />
I realize it's frustrating to carve time out of your schedule and then be unable to actually play. If there were anything we could do to prevent this, we would, but an alpha/beta environment is inherently less stable and polished because of how things are changing constantly, both in obvious player-facing ways but also in terms of behind-the-scenes tech. I apologize, but I honestly can't say that it won't happen again - it might. The disclaimers that accompany each raid testing announcement aren't just empty words. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/407679-raid-testing-schedule-april-8-11/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17611003661?page=1#7))<br />
<br />
FEEDBACK: Mythic/Mythic+ Dungeons<br />
Thanks for the great feedback so far, and lots of useful data. I haven't heard much about the Volcanic affix - any thoughts on how that one played out when it was active?<br />
<br />
In the next build, Necrotic should stack a bit more slowly, but now also reduces absorbs taken as well as heals. Decay seems like it's probably more of a nuisance than an engaging challenge right now, yes? We're still thinking through possible changes with that one. Otherwise, the other affixes seem to have played out largely as envisioned, in terms of modifying gameplay.<br />
<br />
We're keeping an eye on melee-unfriendliness concerns. We specifically avoided making any affixes that felt particularly punitive to melee players; it may be an issue with some specific Halls of Valor mechanics. It's fine if some bosses, or even some dungeons, are less favorable for certain specs or classes; it's not acceptable if the same specs are at a disadvantage in most or all of them, though. <br />
<br />
Not much is likely to change in the next alpha build, but the next steps after that will be porting this system to the other 8 dungeons (Violet Hold will not be part of the keystone system - wave events and timers don't really play well together in a satisfying way).

In future def only queueing for w/e role the satchel is up for, and will return feedback. Thanks so much for looking into this.<br />
Just to follow up, this report helped us improve the queue logic a bit. The situation you encountered shouldn't reoccur. Thanks! (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/717769658607083520))<br />
<br />
So, not trying to rile anything up, just curious did Adventure Mode get cut? or is it WIP?<br />
That's World Quests. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/717804185069072384))<br />
Ah, will we getting more information regarding what it entails in the coming future? End-Game questing? thanks for responses.<br />
Yes, soon! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/717814833366720512))<br />

Problem is that people forget that it works like that, they watch streams on twitch, they read comments on sites and forums and they assume that what they're seeing is the final product... specially if you're like 99% of the people that write the most absurd comments on everything, they're not playing the alpha, they have no idea what's really going on</div></div><hr />

MadSeasonShow in youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOvz3kkYZtCTeXKdiuMG8eg) makes exceptional Legion videos covering individual specs which are linear, thorough, and overall just enjoyable to watch. The only downside is that he only has a few spec guides covered so far and takes about 7-10 days to release a new one. Maybe once he has more videos out, replace Final Boss' videos with MSS? I used to enjoy them but now it's mostly rambling and half the time he doesn't seem to know what he's talking about (just my opinion). Thanks.</div></div><hr />

See this is what confuses the crap out of Blizzard. &quot;Dungeons are too easy. Heroics are too easy. Mythic Dungeons is a joke! Challenge Modes are not really challenging!&quot; <br />
<br />
So they put in a system to make dungeons harder each time you complete them, not a set difficulty level. &quot;I hate this!&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc17dca7fbbd</div><div class="date">2016-04-12, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and this is why alpha should be f... closed and down to only f&amp;f so all crying youtubers/streams who want to get 5 second fame on bashing blizzard for everything be gagged untill blizzard tells them ok this is ocmpleted show it to playerbase in beta.<br />
<br />
actually what people have in mind when talking about &quot;lack of content&quot; or &quot;not many updates&quot; is: there is nothing new added, there isnt much left to add from what was announced, and stuff currently in is...well...&quot;meh&quot;<br />
<br />
not much to expect from 7.1 or 7.2 (almost nobody expects more than 2 patches, even 7.1 will be marked as &quot;delayed tier raid we tested in alpha/beta&quot;, this is so funny)<br />
<br />
we saw how quickly 8-9 dungeons can become boring, no more dungeons announced so far, once you are done with your artifacts (aka finished building up your garrison) i honestly dont see much to do, crafting is still a joke (even though its &quot;back&quot; you still get better loot from raids and progression system is just stretched out current system), did i forget anything? No new battleground, who cares about &quot;add random pillars&quot;-arena?...</div></div><hr />

How can you hate it, really? It adds to an already existing feature, Mythic will still be hard but those who want now have the option to make it harder. I just don't get how that is someting to hate.<br />

Yeah but the main problem with the content wasn't that it was not hard/challanging enough.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the problem is that you haven't got any new dungeons. If I want to play the same content harder and harder I'd buy Diablo. But I don't want, so...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, at the launch is enough. 3 difficulty is more than enough (Norm/HC/Mythic), but the main problem (especially in Warlords) that there were no new dungeons. <br />
<br />
A new difficulty is not a new content.</div></div><hr />

It is though, just not the content you want. I get that, WoD went way to long without adding new content overall, a couple of dungeons would at least make for some distractions.</div></div><hr />

Personally I would be glad if EVERYONE who liked vanilla would stop playing wow. I think WOW has grown into something wonderfull:) It caters to many many playstyles and different menthality.

<br />
In my opinion the problem is that you haven't got any new dungeons. If I want to play the same content harder and harder I'd buy Diablo. But I don't want, so...<br />
<br />
Well, they cant create content faster than it gets consumed without it becoming extremely repetitive with different art. So it looks like you should sub ubtil it gets stale and then unsub until a content patch adds new stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First people complain that dungeons aren't lasting the entire expansion now they're going to last the entire expansion and i'm pretty sure there's going to be 11 dungeons at launch because on the alpha there's another dungeon. So more diverse and difficult dungeons than any expansion so far and people still complain, you just can't win with such ''customers''.<br />

What is wrong with having additional tiers of dungeons like we had in BC (MGT), Wrath (PdK, ICC), and Cata (ZA/ZG remakes, EoT)? This was a great way to present additional lore, add upgraded gear and new dungeons, which also give valor. I liked that approach definitely more than TI or Tanaan. They even can use the same art assets as the current raid or earlier released dungeons to save time in creation these dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the problem of wow (for many) is the lack of challenge AND the problem of wow (for many others and/or the same) is the lack of content, and the boring repetetive nature of things. its both ! both are problems. not the first OR the second one.<br />
<br />
its correct that the myth+ modes dont help with the second one. but it helps at least for the first one. and this is better than nothing and better than wod.<br />
<br />
and nobody knows if blizz really dont add new content. i personally assume it will be similar as WoD, and that sucks, but it is also possible blizz adds more dungeon while Legion. when hots and overwatch dont work well (at the moment hots hasnt that much players) they maybe shift a little bit back to wow. we will see. <br />
<br />
but its better than nothing.<br />

I don't know what is more effort: Some small dungeons in addition to a raid, or a whole area with daily quests etc. The only special about dungeons is balancing of mechanics, but they could be lazy here and just copy-paste bosses in regards to mechanics. They already do sometimes.</div></div><hr />

Oh no, i'd like to get more dungeons, but i just mean the mythic dungeon system, as in that you can re-do the dungeons with increased difficulty through out the entire expansion and people still complain and cry about that even though it's not a must, so that's what bothers me, whatever blizzard adds, even if it's good there will always be these people crying for literally no reason.<br />

Yep, a lot of people from vanilla seem to complain about everything blizzard puts out. Not all of them obviously because i've met some that think vanilla wasn't all that great and they can see flaws in every expansion, unlike some people lol.

I think what makes people upset is that instead of fixing issues like power creep Blizzard find away around them like having the content scale along with the power creep. In TBC for example the heroic dungeon gear and the crafted gear was relevant for a long time because of the small increments of power on raid gear. A solution like this will only work within itself and current content. The outside world and older content will still remain faceroll soon after the expansion launches.</div></div><hr />

In fact, I like increasing difficulty due to extra mechanics with a fixed timeframe better than the current CMs with same mechanics but go-go-go faster mentality. You are awarded for handling increasingly tougher dungeons, this is OK. I just love having story progression mirrored in dungeons, not raids only.<br />

<br />
Easily? I don't play Diablo, because -- I know this is shocking -- I don't like it. Diablo-style dungeons is not something I ever wished for in all my 10 years of playing WoW. Running the same dungeon hundreds of times with slightly different stats for slightly different loot is not remotely fun or interesting to me. Especially since I've not enjoyed any of the dungeons they've made since Wrath. Besides, this still requires a regular group of 5, which won't always be online or available to play with. <br />
<br />
And you're really naive if you believe Blizzard's hand-waving about Garrisons 3.0. They said the same thing in WoD beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, but wow is more casual friendly nowadays, so this way blizzard tries to make it challenging and difficult for everyone on their own level, which is great. People who are crying are being a bit ridiculous at this point, people are just looking for everything to hate on nowadays when it comes to wow.</div></div><hr />

Well, pretty sure any game will look boring and repetitive after 11 years... And WoW is still going strong, even with half of the subscribers gone. This says A TON about this game. <br />

Thing about HotS is more because of MOBA being very shallow genre. They actually added a lot of novelty, but probably too much at once :P And well... some of that novelty shallowed the genre even further.</div></div><hr />

So true. It quickly got old in Diablo and it will in wow as well. A new difficulity is just not content. It's a rehash of old content and rehashed material rarely ever goes over well in MMOs.<br />

blizzard might as well come straight out and tell you that you will be running the same dungeons till your eyes bleed for the next year if not more and the only change will be some Affix the boss gets.<br />

Challenge Modes were an amazing feature when they first released in MoP, and this seems like the logical step.<br />

I just hope it would work a bit more like Path of Exile maps, where you can spend currencies to reroll the affixes and prefixes, instead of not having a choice to do so.

Say a guy whu never raid in tbc after you clear first tier of raids what was not so hard and go in to the second tier , heroics become laughable and you dident need to go there for any reason exept reputation or crafting loot.<br />
&quot; crafted gear was relevant for a long time&quot; Crafted Gear was PART of Raiding !! blacksmith weapons for example ... But you could not make them if you wasn't Raiding !<br />
&quot;The outside world and older content will still remain faceroll soon after the expansion launches.&quot; Only fore Hardcore raiders , we are what?? 10% of WoW population?? You see &quot;Special Snowflake&quot; there are people(like 90% of wow population) who still play this game for fun and dont have mythic gear .</div></div><hr />

I think each raid tier should be 5 iLvl increase with each difficulty being worth 1 iLvl. Mythic reward nothing beyond achievements, cosmetics, mounts, pets, gold, etc. Mythic would ideally be force scaled down. Meaning you can't later come back and cheese it. Ever. You'd be auto- scaled down. This way those mounts and achievements are #worthit.<br />
<br />
I like the welfare legendary idea because I've had too many times people leave guild after getting the legendary. No thanks.<br />
<br />
I also don't like the level scaling as how a level 90 has, literally, no chance against a level 100. A smart level 90 should destroy a dumb level 100.<br />
<br />
There's several things in Diablo I like that I wish WoW had. The Xmog system being one and the account-bound bank being another.<br />
<br />
I do NOT think we need new profession shit every expansion. I'd be ok with them only adding things when needed. So, for instance, we'd stay with what we had (+20 BA, +20 vers, etc) enchants -- we don't need new and more every single expansion. This would imply that professions like inscription would need a re-work to help and be in line, but I think the general idea is there. This would reduce the need to iLvl squish and power creep. People always need stuff. I'd be ok with inscription bringing party buffs and making classes bring their own buff.<br />

This seems true for the same reasons many bands have difficulty with later albums. Most of the music that people love in the debut album has evolved over a much longer period of time of trial and error that the masses dont see.

Well considering you can bring your gear with you -- I can see them justified. Who would want to run a non-Mythic person? I mean we already see *absurd* LFG iLvl requests for normal mode runs. I can't wait to see the iLvl requests for Keystone dungeons. I find it funny how people want a challenge but then make absurd iLvl requests to make it easier.<br />
<br />
They need to set an iLvl for it and give default gear so it's purely about skill -- hopefully similar to how PvP will be.</div></div><hr />

Don't think they've ever been close to WoW's playerbase. TF2 hasn't gone above 85k players a day for last 6 months.

<br />
Problem is, we've heard this all before: &quot;This is incomplete, the finished version will be MUCH different!&quot; (coughShipyardscough) (Blue: Patch 6.1 has PLENTY of world content!)<br />
<br />
Looking at Class Halls, they're Garrisons, with a different paint job. I'm not the only one who thinks that. And for them to write that long a post on unfinished content? I think we're right. And they know it. The film flam has begun. <br />
<br />
Looking at Legion, I see nothing i want to spend my free time doing. Months of class revamping, when everyone will be running around in the same flavor of the week cookie cutter builds, artifacts as the new grind, and you'd better log in constantly to keep up, or you'll be cockblocked from pugs, and raids that the idea of sharing with the typical player these days in pugs or LFR puts my teeth on edge. Oh, and maybe a week of leveling. And the same old battlegrounds and *gag* Ashran. <br />
<br />
Sorry Legion. I'm still passing. I can get the lore elsewhere, and if it's as bad as WOD, I'll be happier not paying for it. The only thing that caught my eye was the sheep staff, and I can see that here. But I'm sure all the suckers who sign up with a free month from seeing the movie will think it's all shiny and cool - until they try to play it seriously. But that's none of my business.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2016-04-12, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must admit, Blizzard were fucking machines in vanilla and TBC. The problem is they were releasing TOO MUCH content and people didn't get to see it all. Now they're not releasing enough and people are sick of it.<br />
<br />
It's too front loaded - it's all released at the beginning, and it's blazed through too fast. They need to spread it out, like Wrath, Cata and MoP - have 3 raid tiers, 8 months each, with 5 mans associated with them, like Ulduar, or the Throne Of Thunder, or Icecrown.<br />
<br />
I honestly believe if they had added 3 5-mans to Hellfire Citadel, there would be less bitching. It's not an unreasonable idea, as it's something they pretty much did every expansion up to WoD. <br />
<br />
Now, IF they have stuff like Ulduar or Icecrown or Throne Of Thunder and SoO planned, that there's no hint of yet, with raid, 5 man, and open world content attached to it, then great. I think that's the kind of expansion most people want - content for everyone. <br />
<br />
If they went back to 5-man design like vanilla, even better - large content zones, like Blackrock mountain, with the questing leading into it, which sets up the raids, even better. LONG dungeons. Not short hallways you can clear first try. Dungeons you actually feel challenged going into, even with good gear. Not this one and done design they do now. I still think Spires was a horrible waste of an opportunity - going into WOD I wanted to explore more of the city in the spires, see what the life up there was like, their lore, but all we got was a short, uninteresting 5-man that was entirely forgettable. Highmaul was also a wasted opportunity for 5 mans and lore. <br />
<br />
I just want to know what the decision making was, to go from a nearly feature complete expansion like MoP to a bare bones, half of an expansion like WOD was. Legion on paper looks a little better, but I have my doubts. (MoP had it's obvious problems, ToT should have lasted longer, and of course, the massive gap after SoO - even though that kept people busy for quite a while) What people want is pretty obvious - more non-raid content, spread out over the life of the expansion so it's not consumed in the first couple weeks of release. It's not rocket science.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beet</div><div class="date">2016-04-13, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah but the main problem with the content wasn't that it was not hard/challanging enough.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the problem is that you haven't got any new dungeons. If I want to play the same content harder and harder I'd buy Diablo. But I don't want, so...<br />
<br />
Well that's a very dumb thing to say. Diablo and WoW are nothing alike even if they have the exact same difficulty setting. If Diablo were an MMO you'd have a point but it's not, so...<br />
<br />
Honestly I think Blizzard is going to eventually say fuck it and just bring back the system they had from Wrath. Each time they try new stuff it fails or is shit on before even getting a chance.</div></div><hr />

Every new feature blizz adds gets hated by some people immediately because ''it's not vanilla'' Just quit wow if you literally hate everything that gets added.<br />
<br />
First people complain that dungeons aren't lasting the entire expansion now they're going to last the entire expansion and i'm pretty sure there's going to be 11 dungeons at launch because on the alpha there's another dungeon. So more diverse and difficult dungeons than any expansion so far and people still complain, you just can't win with such ''customers''.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I would be glad if EVERYONE who liked vanilla would stop playing wow. I think WOW has grown into something wonderfull It caters to many many playstyles and different menthality. You can basically play how you like and the devs try their best to make all kinds of ways &quot;valid&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Calm down. I was replying to these. Personally I don't mind about how the game is but I have sympathy for those who feel that they don't like the game anymore since it has been changed for the &quot;better&quot;.</div></div><hr />
