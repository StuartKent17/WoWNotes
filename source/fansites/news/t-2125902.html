10 EUR/25 EUR.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, the 10 EUR one if 100% donated, while the 25 EUR is not. Meaning, Blizzard tries to make money on charity, meaning I'm not buying them from Blizzard even though I initially wanted the first one. &quot; sales of the the plush will benefit Make-A-Wish &quot;.<br />

<br />
The article for Argi's donation to ARC in support of Ebola relief is a good example. The comments on there were a complete shitstorm. There was also some complaining about the Fey Dragon/Alterac Brew Pup Make-A-Wish donation. Maybe I shouldn't be surprised though as a lot of the community site is full of toxicity. <br />

It's fine if you don't want to donate — you don't have to make excuses. This is Blizzard: they would have made the sales, regardless; and it's safe to assume that a sizable portion of the sale price of the plushie is going toward charity. (Probably $10 of the $25.)</div></div><hr />

You're looking at this too cynically. They could have easily put this cat up for 10$ and kept all of the profits like they do for most of their in game pets/mounts.<br />
<br />
This one, they are donating all of it to charity for a limited time. I actually used this time to buy it and like knowing that the $10 I paid will be going to help a sick child realize their dream.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to donate through Blizz and get a cool pet while you're at it, then you could always just donate directly to the charity of your choice, which will also be good.</div></div><hr />

If 100% of the sales is going to charity, then why would you care? If anything, I'd want them to sell as much as possible.

Yes, but it still increases the sales of the 25 EUR. And using charity to promote it is the worst kind of promotion (it works but still despicable). <br />
Anyway. If you donate and expect something in return such as feeling good afterwards or a pet then lol.</div></div><hr />

our server (dentarg and whisperwind)<br />
has a guy in trade chat who idk how has become like a idol of some sort<br />
and i remember the christmas the goat pet came out<br />
he was saying that blizzard are filthy liars, and all the money they make off it they keep and they give none to charity<br />
when we told him he could go and see the transaction to the charity when it goes through he said then blizzard simply lies and keeps 90% of the money for themselves</div></div><hr />

Using &quot;Charity&quot; as a marketing strategy is despicable and I don't support that. Again, my morals. Pretty undervalued moral, but that's the only way you get rid of the people that use &quot;Charity&quot; for their own good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Which makes perfect sense...The 10 EUR one is a digital item which effectively costs Blizzard nothing (aside from artist time) to give you while the 25 EUR is a physical, manufactured item that costs something to make. It isn't unrealistic for Blizzard to have some of the money sent back to them so that they can balance the costs of buying all the plushes themselves. If they are indeed profiting from it then that would be pretty corrupt but if it is being done to balance what they are spending to manufacture the item and likely to pay the artist(s) who created it then they are just serving as a vehicle for charity money.<br />
<br />
There is no evidence here that they are using it as a marketing strategy and not a charity device.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the end it comes down to whether you want the pet or not with that little bonus of 'charity'.

<br />
And again, how is it a marketing strategy when literally all of the proceeds is going to charity? This isn't &quot;5% of all proceeds go to some anonymous charity you don't know but exists!&quot; This is right there in black and white &quot;100% goes to M-A-W until the 31st&quot;. If you don't want to give the money to Blizz, then buy it now and have all of your money go to charity...<br />

<br />
Then do it. <br />
<br />
However, there are millions of people like me who normally WOULDN'T donate anything to charity but will now because they get a pet out of it... The 10$ I donated wouldn't have been donated if not for this pet. So whether it's a tax write-off or not, it's still a lot of money going to M-A-W that would normally not have been going there. I would have used this $10 on 2 cups of coffee if not for this.</div></div><hr />

This isn't &quot;5% of all proceeds go to some anonymous charity you don't know but exists!&quot; This is right there in black and white &quot;100% goes to M-A-W until the 31st&quot;. If you don't want to give the money to Blizz, then buy it now and have all of your money go to charity...<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then do it. <br />
<br />
However, there are millions of people like me who normally WOULDN'T donate anything to charity but will now because they get a pet out of it... The 10$ I donated wouldn't have been donated if not for this pet. So whether it's a tax write-off or not, it's still a lot of money going to M-A-W that would normally not have been going there. I would have used this $10 on 2 cups of coffee if not for this.<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel like the 'its a deduction I only do it for taxes so I'd rather donate directly' argument is a bit flawed, and ignores the fact that plenty of people don't get those tax deductions anyway. All of my charitable donations, medical costs, student loan etc that could qualify for a deduction come up to WAY LESS than the standard deduction. And I'm married so that standard deduction is even higher than if I was single. <br />
<br />
So great that guy has enough deductions that a $10 tax deduction would matter. Most tax payers don't have that luxury.<br />
<br />
So when I donate, it's because I want to, not because I'm gonna get something out of it. But I definitely don't mind a wow pet, I've gotten most of the ones that donate to make-a-wish.</div></div><hr />

Tax write-offs are literally pennies. This site helps explain it better: http://www.thesimpledollar.com/charity-and-your-tax-bill/<br />
<br />
Basically, you reduce your taxes by .25 cents for every dollar you donate. To Blizzard, a multi-billion dollar taking in several hundred million every quarter, it's technically not even noticeable. Let's assume they sell 50k pets which I doubt they will, that's $500k going to M-A-W foundation WHICH IS AWESOME! and they get to save about $125k in taxes. That's even assuming they're on the same tax bracket as us, which I severely doubt. I'm sure they pay much less taxes as a company than their employees pay... Even then, $125k translate to about how much they spend on paperclips every year...</div></div><hr />

Using &quot;Charity&quot; as a marketing strategy is despicable and I don't support that. Again, my morals. Pretty undervalued moral, but that's the only way you get rid of the people that use &quot;Charity&quot; for their own good.<br />
<br />
i dont think you understand what charity means</div></div><hr />

This will be my first ever in game item purchase in the 10 years I have been playing. It's going to charity, Blizzard made a really awesome advertisement to do it, and the pet itself is adorable! Love it, and the Winter Veil stuff in the video has me wondering if Winter Veil will be a bit better this year?<br />
<br />
Good stuff! I will not be responding to any ridiculous hate over this pet. The people who have anything negative to say about it really show their true selves, and frankly I'm not interested in their thoughts, nor do I care about anything these type of persons have to say about anything else. Typically these types of people believe their thoughts and opinions are really important, and yet they literally offer nothing constructive, positive, or of any real value to this world.</div></div><hr />

Or I could spend 10 knowing it's still going to charity and get a nice looking kitty which would be cool for my pet collection?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The people who whine most about taxes often are the people who have the least to worry about them. This bright bulb is not itemizing his taxes and taking into account a 10$ charitable donation. He's spouting hot air to sound contrarian on a website. <br />
<br />
If you don't like the Pet, don't buy it. If you do, buy it. If you don't care about the pet but like the cause, go for it either way. But stop acting like people who buy it are somehow less pure than anyone else.</div></div><hr />
