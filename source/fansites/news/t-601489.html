Druid post<br />
<br />
The Druid class is somewhat under-represented in the Arenas, which there of course are various reasons for. The developers are looking into the Druids overall performance in the Arenas, so I would say that it is too soon to give up on your Druid just yet. :-)<br />
<br />
Rogue post<br />
<br />
[...]But in regards to Rogue performance in the Arenas in general, this is something that the developers are looking into. I do not have much more info on this available at this moment in time, but we will keep you informed as soon as we know more about the developers plans to improve the Rogue situation in Arenas.<br />
<br />
Many of you have posted good ideas for ways to improve performance and the Rogue class in general, and I would just like to thank you all for that. Keep letting us know what you think, and please keep posting your suggestions :-)<br />

Nihilum vs Millenium<br />
Fragbite (http://www.fragbite.com/) released a video of the Nihilum (http://www.nihilum.eu) vs Millenium (http://www.millenium-source.org) match held during the ESWC in France. The quality isn't outstanding but it's decent enough to be watched ^^<br />

I have just found a near identical response on a hunter thread, heres what Vaneras said :<br />
&quot;Please note however, that you should not expect to see any full class revamp before the next expansion, but that doesn't mean that there won't be any tweaks and changes done in order to improve the Hunter class. The developers are aware that the Hunter class is one of the classes that are less represented in the Arenas, and that is something they are looking into.&quot;<br />
I have a feeling that things like this will creep up on every class forum, and the &quot;changes&quot; will most likely never become reality, just written as a morale boost to keep certain classes keep on playing arena ....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally agree, with new trinket making all classes able to break traps and 30 sec CD on traps then unless you are BM spec you are screwed. Even with scatter shot it doesn't give you long enough to get out of melee range if your own trinket is on CD.<br />
<br />
A few questions.<br />
<br />
Why does the effects of blind last far longer than scatter shot when we are the ones who need it most to get to range.<br />
<br />
Why doesn't sheep, frost nova, fear etc. have 30 sec CD like traps and all break on damage like traps.<br />
<br />
Why does hamstring, crippling poison last far longer than wingclip.<br />
<br />
Then we have LOS issues and general lack of space. Hunters are worst class in arenas and they want to buff druids and rogues in there.<br />
<br />
Trying being a Hunter and killing a feral Druid in bear form with good gear or getting a way from a Rogue who takes 80% of your HP befoe you can even get out of his stuns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1) Because scatter have 30 sec cooldown and blind 5min (3.5 after talents)? Anyway anyone will trinket out of it so...<br />
2) Because WoW &quot;PvP&quot; is not balanced. It is PvE game and will be PvE game, some funny arenas won't change it.<br />
3) Hamstring is OP yes, but crippling can be removed easily as it is poison.<br />
4) This is true. Arenas are small boxes and it hurts hunters most because of deadzone.<br />
5) Try being a rogue and killing a bear... same shit, hell even worse. And rogue who takes your 80% hp in stun? Use trinket or really replace that outland greens.<br />
<br />
And back to topic...<br />
There are very few druids in arenas but not many people play druid anyway.<br />
Problem with rogues is in PvP everyone will take arms warrior instead of rogue. Why would you take rogue instead of warrior? Intercept &gt; Sprint, Hamstring, MS &gt; poisons, plate &gt; leather etc. Stuns? Trinket! And war with 2h mace spec and intercept can stun even better :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mantisen</div><div class="date">2007-07-09, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing is that neither rogue or hunters are nerfed in the arena, no class really is. It's all about how you compose the team and how you specc your class. There is a vast difference in speccing for PvP and speccing for PvE. I know it's not easy to solve the range problem for hunters in the arena but it is highly doable. <br />
Few classes have the kiting ability / ranged dps that hunters have. I know the new / recent changes to the PvP trinket is a problem but it works both ways. While a rogue can remove trap etc with the trinket a hunter can remove sap and stuns with the very same trinket.<br />
Saying that CS / Kidney Shot doesn't run on the same timer is a weak excuse, you just have to learn to prioritise what you want / need to remove!<br />
In my opinion (I can't speak for anyone else) people need to realize there is a big difference between PvPing and PvEing. You can not just gear up to tier 6 in PvE, enter the arena and expect to own in PvP. You do not have the advantages of a tank taking all the hits while getting healed 24/7, you will have to keep the distance on your own and stay alive. <br />
It's all about adapting to your opponents, I've gotten taken down by hunters with silencing shot multiple times and I've won against them aswell (playing a healing class silencing shot can be a bitch ;)). It might not be a good idea to enter a 2 v 2 arena with hunter / healer while a hunter / rogue can be a bitch since the rogue can keep the other teams dps on a distance.<br />
<br />
Ah well, that's just my 2 cents. If you want to pvp with you're class:<br />
<br />
1. Specc pvp<br />
2. Get a teammate / mates that matches your specc / class (might take some experimenting)<br />
3. Learn to take advantages of your opponents weaknesses, leech mana from mana classes, dot rogues, etc.<br />
4. You can not win all your matches against all classes, all classes have weaknesses against certain classes! Some classes suck at playing another class while they have an easier time against other classes. (Frost mages vs Warriors, Elemental Shammies vs most mages, etc, etc).<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Forgot to say that getting good at pvp requires alot of training with your class, learning how to take down other classes takes knowledge about them. Knowing what stunns / attacks / weaknesses / cooldowns other classes have can be a life saver. For example it can be a big help knowing how long CD roges have on kick, hunters on traps, etc, etc. :) But if PvP doesn't get you're steam going stick to killing bosses with your guild or something else ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilith</div><div class="date">2007-07-10, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warrior vs Shaman.<br />
<br />
Warrior Charges you, now you can either chose to;<br />
<br />
1. Lie down and die.<br />
2. Use your trinket when charged, get out of range then get intercepted and die.<br />
3. Try to outheal MS and die. (Pummel)<br />
4. Try to outdps the warrior and die (Pummel)<br />
5. Connect to the ventrilo of the guild from which the warrior is and send naked pictures of girlz and hope he accepts your humble offering.<br />
6. Go emo.<br />
7. Reroll.<br />
<br />
I'm just telling shamans need some other CC, whatever class you mention they have loads more :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mantisen</div><div class="date">2007-07-10, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I do agree shammies can do have a hard time against warriors, but they are downable if you are a decent geared elemental shaman. This I know for a fact seeing that I've just recently respecced to resto from elemental. But putting other than warriors a decent geared shaman stands a good chance against most classes, even rogues. It's just all about specc and reflexes (yes gear might be a small factor aswell ;)). In my own opinion this goes for most classes, a good hunter/mage/rogue/pala/warrior/priest/druid/warlock/shaman can down most enemies but some classes are more difficult (some very difficult) for some classes. That's just the way it is. You cant rock against every class and you cant rock in PvP with every specc, even if it would be fun if enchantment shammies wouldn't suck ass in pvp ;) But thats the whole point Im trying to make, if you want to PvP you have to be prepared to specc / gear for it. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkspells</div><div class="date">2007-07-10, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see why druids are getting any buffs. First off, I've never played a druid in arenas. So to some, its probably going to seem like I'm talking out of my ass, but I think cyclone alone makes druids useful, I don't see anything wrong with them. Rogues on the other hand, I kinda can see them needing a small buff, nothing to huge. Really the only thing wrong with rogues (that I can see) is resilience nerfing their dmg to hell. If there aiming for class balancing etc, I think they should have a look at pallys/warriors, there a little to OP'd (in arenas) imo. It seems that almost every 5v5 (or pretty much any bracket of arenas for that matter) HAS to have a MS warrior, and most likely a pally (or some other healing class, most of the time its a pally, though.) From what I've read (and the main reason rogues have been complaining) is due to warriors, I've heard the question &quot;Why bring a rogue, when you could bring a warrior?&quot; brought up many times, and I have to agree. Why bring a rogue? When you could have a warrior, that does more dmg, is harder to kill, and also has the infamous &quot;MS debuff&quot;. I know rogues have wound poison, but it takes 5 stacks just to get it matched up with MS, and its dispellable.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-07-11, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druids in arenas are already ridiculous, I watched a 2v2 match between my brother and friend (Shadow Priest and Holy Paladin in Epics) vs a Druid and a rogue, anytime anything was looking bad they'd both stun or gouge and run away, heal and drink up, and come right back out and annihilate them.<br />
<br />
Druids are the most versatile class in the game, making them amazing in arenas, I don't see why they need beefed up any if they already have one of the best CC's in the game, can heal, run, AND damage when needed...<br />
<br />
btw as a BM hunter I've had very few issues in arenas, only a few choice classes that can close the gap (warriors mainly) give me trouble.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smy</div><div class="date">2007-07-11, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The arena season one data showing druid as the worst can be used to empirically show that yes, druid is the WORST class PVP hands down. You can't dispute it. Months of arena data does not lie. <br />
<br />
Druid can choose to switch roles, yes, but they are not hybrids. The can't heal in dps form or tank form. They can't cyclone from shifted forms. Switching to heal or cyclone or root is like hanging a giant &quot;kill me&quot; sign our their backs. They have no immunity bubbles, no AE fears or multi-cc options, no way to get out of melee range effectively and only one way to get into melee if they have talented for it. <br />
<br />
Just because the odd druid who happened to have hear at least 20% better than yours killed you or rather you don't have enough experience fighting them or you watched some epeen edited movie from warcraftmovies does not invalidate real world data.<br />
<br />
Best CC's in the game.... 6 sec cc? then 3? then 1.5? Right. 1.5 cast 1.5 GCD. Leaves room for 2 hots in between.<br />
<br />
All classes of have issues, druid just happens to have the short end of the stick. If you buff them PVP you risk unbalancing them for PVE, which the game is designed around. PVP is an afterthought in this game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I forgot to mention the reduced hit box bug that has been in existence since beta, as well. That's just icing on the cake. &quot;You're too far away.&quot; &quot;You must get closer.&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-07-11, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I care not how many druids made it to the top 100 or how many warriors made it etc., I've seen some really good druids who are really really good at their class, and honestly, I really hope they don't beef anyone at this point in the game, maybe fix some druid associated BUGS but druids don't need any &quot;tweaking&quot;.<br />
<br />
And rogues as well, fix vanish and thats about it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smy</div><div class="date">2007-07-11, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Again, you don't care about druids. You're pretty much self-centered on what benefits you. No improper inference here; that is just how most people are. However, by ignoring the overall data and refusing to look at PVP impartially, your opionion is just that, and opinion- no factual basis to back it up.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I play a druid now. Three years ago I played an orc warrior, then an undead rogue, undead warlock, etc, etc. I hopped on my warrior and warlock and pretty much without playing them in over a year, with old world equipment, can decimate people without much effort. On my current druid I have had to gear up so much more and focus so intensely on trying to use my abilities in a way where I won't become seriously disadvantaged for healing, or cc's, or shifting to paper tiger to dps just try even be slightly average. Go ahead, say I must suck without any basis for such an opinion other than an illusory means to try and back up an opinion. I am a top performer at PVE content, but when it comes to PVP the class is very lacking. Mostly it is due to survivability or lack of counters/transitional abilities.<br />
<br />
If you think druids are overpowered, you're letting a few memorable experiences jade you. Sure, there are some exceptionally geared druids with great talent at playing their characters, but if they were so awesome, there would be more of them playing in the game (druid is the lowest population in the game for a reason) as well as in the upper regions of arena rankings (gain, see the previous statement). You can't ignore the 4 months of arena data. You can say the earth is flat, but that doesn't make it so.<br />
<br />
My 2v2/3v3 partner is a hunter and I know how difficult hunters can have it, but a capable hunter should know a druid is more or less a free kill. He'll tell you so himself, the ass. :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-07-11, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright you completely blew my words out of proportion, you are speaking like a stereotypical druid here, you speak as if everyone else is out to get you and like your class is the most nerfed in the game...<br />
<br />
I play a Human Mage, Blood Elf Hunter, and Orc Warlock, I have no issues in the arenas as my hunter, my mage has a few issues (being raid specc'd in arenas never works out) and my warlock dominates.<br />
<br />
The issue is that just because the percentages in the top 100 teams divided out odd everyone thinks &quot;Oh no, only 2% druids, that MUST mean druids suck in pvp!&quot;, wrong, get that out of your head now, statistics are statistics, and in this case it just means a good chunk of druids have no idea how to play their class..<br />
<br />
Any class can beat any class, if you know what you are doing, if you go straight off statistics about how nerfed your class is, you just need to quit the game, all classes right now are FAIRLY balanced, mage damage needs tweaked, druids are a bit on the upside and rogues have a few bugs, but other than that I don't see any issues that need fixed.<br />
<br />
Good druids don't whine, too bad there aren't more of them.<br />
<br />
(Btw druids being a low percentage in the game has nothing to do with their abilities, its a class that only 2 out of 10 races have access to, try comparing that to say, a Rogue, who any race can be save 1 race (maybe 2 too tired to research), the more races a class can be, the more of that class you will see)</div></div><hr />
