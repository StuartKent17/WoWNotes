<br />
Melee haste rating has been nerfed, and it now requires 15.76 points of haste to get 1% increased attack speed. (Instead of 10.51 on the live servers)<br />
<br />
Ranged haste rating calculation is the same as Melee.<br />
<br />
Spell haste rating has been upgraded, and it now requires 15.76 points of haste to get 1% increased cast speed. (Instead of 21 on the live servers)<br />
<br />
If you want to check your haste rating on both PTR and Live servers, you can use the two following commands :<br />
<br />
Melee haste rating<br />
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(GetCombatRatingBonus(18))<br />
<br />
Ranged haste rating<br />
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(GetCombatRatingBonus(19))<br />
<br />
Spell haste rating<br />
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(GetCombatRatingBonus(20))<br />
<br />
You should get a % value in your chatbox like in the following examples. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maas</div><div class="date">2007-08-18, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If this goes through on top of the windfury hotfix they should add a note saying to reroll wizard hat and robe. Melee have to be higher dps/utility to warrant their inclusion in a raid or group given how far more convenient ranged dps is in EVERY setting. Windfury was too good, and is still the best, but a horde of shit is not good enough. The 2.1 patch changed core mechanics like cleave and delivered changes to several encounters large and small specifically to make the expansion more melee friendly because the original design was melee suicide. Now the erosion of 2.1 begins with 2.2? I'm beginning to wonder if the developers actually play melee.<br />
<br />
More of the same from Northrend? Mobs that instantly and without warning give the tank a 10k per second aura of death to rogues sounds like the perfect &quot;challenge&quot; to preclude taking any melee dps to said encounter. Sounds outlandish (haha funny), but thats a Northrend scaled version of what Omor in Heroic Ramparts did, and post-nerf still clings to pretty closely. How about mobs that have an auto attack for 5k with a whirlwind that goes off in 1 second (5k damage), snares, and fears? What if we followed him with an NPC that heals, cleanses, and lays down an 800 point consecrate under himself constantly? Thats Heroic Durnholde, probably the single least used heroic. And that is its current inception, not &quot;pre-nerf&quot;.<br />
<br />
There is no such thing as &quot;ranged haste rating&quot;. Haste rating applies to all physical dps rounds. So hunters will be affected negatively.<br />
<br />
I hope this doesn't go live, but regardless of this potential nerf several encounters are still mad queer for melee participants.</div></div><hr />

That is a buff. It only requires 15.76 spell haste to = 1% haste. Before you needed 21...<br />
So if you a trinket that increases spell haste by 320 for 6 seconds. Before it was 15.23......%<br />

<br />
So it was ok for melee DPS to suck ass when you first reach level 70 because melee classes are supposedly more gear dependant, but it is not ok if there is some turnaround and with the best gear going melee DPS is better than caster DPS.<br />
<br />
How exactly are melee DPS to compete if blizz keep rebalancing the game such that you are equal to caster DPS in the best items available but inferior in any combination of lesser gear. It should be either balanced at all times or imbalanced in favour of each side 50% of the time.</div></div><hr />

Thats bullshit.. BT items giving to much haste? Nerf those items then. My DraginSpineTrophee is a much needed tool to stay near the top. Nerfing that hurts no matter how little a nerf it may be.</div></div><hr />

But they probably had a valid reason behind it =/ I doubt they do anything just to be asses and because they hate a class (although Blizz devs sleep with a Warlock Plushie =P)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maas</div><div class="date">2007-08-20, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, they're doing it due to a continued neglect of melee mechanics. The xpac was, and still is, fucked up for melee. Yet rather than turn off the gay they want to turn it up. The balancing act with melee is poorly thought out, though that is nothing new. Like one poster stated, melee do worse than casters with weak (uncommon) quality gear, and then do better than them with good (epic) quality gear, and this is a problem? Hunters don't do near as badly as melee with weak gear except over a long duration where they lack mana regen. Warriors and Rogues stand to gain and lose the most with rage and deep combat spec rage-lite (offhand energy gain).<br />
<br />
By all accounts rage is a fucked up system full of potential shortfalls and exploits. Yet even though they fight rage with a pointy stick they decided to give rogues something quite close to rage deep in the combat tree. Result - auto attack damage is not only supplemental to dps, it directly improves the quality and frequency of interactive dps such as specials. No mana user possesses a parallel. Clearcasting states and mana drains just don't compare.<br />
<br />
This is retarded. I anticipate Zul'Aman and The Sunwell, if thats what the tier 7 dungeon is, will be equally unbalanced toward melee for months.<br />
<br />
EverQuest got a lot of shit wrong, but one of their good points was thus: melee suffer far more issues with consistency of damage outgoing and damaging incoming. They are furthermore limited in whether they can even attend an event based on the number of other melee in attendance given the mechanics of the particular encounter. Therefore, in all single target encounters, melee are the undisputed masters of damage.<br />
<br />
WoW refuses to accept this design philosophy, and tries half-heartedly to present risks to ranged attackers that qualify them to stand with the would-be gods. Hunters and Shadow priests are the ones most affected by potential ranged gay with a minimum firing distance (hunter), the greatest need to stay immobile to maximimize dps, and a maximum of 24 yards (shadow priests) for the main dps output. The only other ranged that suffer greatly are healers. And every single one of them is slightly disadvantaged. Healers having a problem presents a problem to those most likely to take damage, the melee. So melee are actually double fucked, once by the multitude of shit affecting their character, and once by the shit affecting their healer.<br />
<br />
This all goes beyond haste rating. Haste rating is only a potential symptom of a problem that has persisted for some time, and I, for one, would prefer they err on the side of melee than against. Pre-BC they did a fairly decent job of not being gay to melee. Someone got a stick up their ass over the naxxramas power of warriors and decided to get creative with the whole range of melee classes to compensate. Enhancement Shamans and Feral Druids were just coming into their own and ran smack into this anti-warrior agenda.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.. you have your own abilities that make you useful, where would we be without warriors tanking for us (paladins and Druids can't tank endgame raids) where would we be without melee DPS on boss fights with high magic resist but low armor?<br />
<br />
Itemization has been aimed at melee classes throughout the whole game, compare the number of melee weapons to the number of caster, then get back to me on the whole &quot;more gear dependant&quot; thing, you have more options, make use of them.<br />

Tanking, furthermore, is not the subject, and it never was. Warriors are the best at tanking. I don't see how this plays in at all to the neglect and/or dislike of melee in event design for TBC since the tank is always being healed regardless.<br />
<br />
If you want to discuss tanking paladins have shitty itemization and druids have a glaring lack of ability to counter crush. Warriors should be the best, but not through the current means. The other tanks are weaker than warriors more due to the itemization and hidden mechanics than clear warrior superiority. I believe Northrend will further close the gap and present us with yet another pretender via the DK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well lets see, I got a great idea, lets make a hybrid class as good as both classes its mimicking! But wait! Who in their right mind would need those other two classes?<br />
<br />
See the issue? Druids =/= Warriors, Druid =/= Rogues (Sadly they are getting more powerful), Paladin =/= Warriors (5 mans maybe, 25 mans and up MTing? Forget it), Survival Hunter =/= Decent Raid DPS (Proven fact, Blizzard has stated they are working on it, Legacy goes to DPS Warriors and Shaman, not Hunters (I'm a hunter too btw))<br />
<br />
DK's will not be main tanks most likely, they will lack a lot of the main threat gaining abilities that make the sword and board combo for warriors what it is, I doubt Blizzard is going to go screw us all up by throwing in a new class that tanks better than a prot warrior, DPS's better than a fury/arms, and uses only 2 hands..<br />
<br />
As for itemization, Its been said COUNTLESS times, 2.3 will include tons of new items on the heroic vendor to close itemization gaps for the extra class branches that have sprung up.<br />
<br />
The point is, melee doesn't suck, stop whining, Rogues and Warriors that know what they are doing should be able to stay at the top of DPS just fine (even though DPS only isn't the main focus of all classes as I keep trying to explain to you, but you are clearly ignoring it, You didn't roll warrior for pure DPS, you rolled it for DPS and Heavy Armor, you rolled it for Tank, you rolled it for being a platemonkey, sure Clothies get higher DPS, but healers have a much more fun time with us then they do with you)<br />
<br />
I understand issues with rage, Blizzard said its being worked on, here's how they put it..<br />
<br />
&quot;You need damage to do more damage, so the issue comes down to, if you don't get enough rage, you don't do enough damage, meaning nothing happens, if you get too much rage, you do too much damage.<br />
<br />
We're in the middle of balancing this out currently, and more Rage normalization is on the way&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't see where you are getting that melee DPS is so screwed up, and if you are a melee hunter saying this, I pity it you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have a lvl 70 warrior and a lvl 70 paladin with Thunder. Neither has ever white crit anywhere near 2k.<br />
My lvl 65 warlock on the other hand, gets 3k+ crits with shadow bolt with alarming regularity, a well geared lvl 70 lock can hit for over 2k with shadow bolt. <br />
<br />
With 600 spell damage from gear and CoE and immolate up a lvl 70 destruction lock will see incinerate hitting for 1.4k+, critting for 2.8k+. Thats pretty poor gear for a lvl 70 lock and casting that incinerate takes less time than swinging the 2 hander takes the warrior and can be continued all the time. If a warrior is seeing a 2k white crit it is because he has popped death wish which can only be up 1/6th of the time. <br />
<br />
<br />
On a different point this is what, the 3rd? time they mess around with haste ratings since the expansion was released? They just got their math wrong the first two times? That surely fills me with confidence for these new values.</div></div><hr />

I was addressing the oft quoted &quot;zomg 2k white crits&quot; that come up whenever warrior DPS is mentioned and pointing out that most of the classes saying that warrior DPS is imba because with the best gear using a damage increasing cooldown warriors can put out a 2k white crit, those same classes wouldn't even notice a 2k crit as anything special in crappy lvl 70 gear. I mean does any caster seriously regard 2k as a big crit?<br />
<br />
Your theory of every class having its specialised DPS role doesn't really hold up since pretty much every boss fight in the game is an 8-10 minute sustained DPS encounter and since warriors and rogues can pretty much put out non stop level damage forever. Only the mage really runs the risk of going OOM in a long fight and even that takes a long time if the mage isn't shy about chugging super mana potions.<br />
<br />
If melee DPS was too high in BT the best fix is to just increase the armor of some of the BT bosses. That change doesn't screw over everyone who isn't in BT. Not to mention that the problem seems to be that melee haste rating works very differently for both warriors and rogues.</div></div><hr />

(also shadow priests can run oom in long fights too, even if like for mages it takes a while, mages use on last bosses can (in most cases) be replaced my locks, but u still need them for water/cc/ports so a little dmg boost is always welcomed to help us kick asses, in the end this nerf/buff for players won't have too many repoercutions on a raid as some dmg will go down and some will go up, so the raid output stays the same +/-, aka, it's not that much of a big deal for PvE, as for PvP... well, w/e not the first time they nerf something, and not the last, better get used to it rly...)</div></div><hr />

If I critted 2k with my &quot;auto-attack&quot; (wand) I'd be staring the screen for 10 minutes, wondering... (btw, I have a mage).<br />

Now, the melee haste nerf is obviously connected with the impact that haste has on melee DPS:<br />
http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=jpme6tfmzpw3g&amp;s=9997-10360 (one random example). <br />
<br />
According to a calculation of a (much berated) druid on the official forums, rogues are outdpsing mages by 30 to 40% on average. That is a bit out of hand, regardless of anything else.<br />
<br />
Now, casting haste.. it was nerfed on the TBC patch. Then no one said much, if nothing else because there wasn't much haste gear around. Now it is being buffed (to previous values? - no idea). <br />
<br />
The class that it is bound to benefit the most form this change are mages, but although they will benefit, mana (and aggro?) issues will constrain. Locks will benefit, although only partially, because of dots. Destro locks, SBs spammers, could benefit the most, not being much mana constrained.<br />
<br />
It is a step to balance damage among classes. Seems to me a fair one, but I guess we will have to see the effects.<br />
<br />
Btw, I won't be seing it personally :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casters gain ~2% spell haste from our trinkets and less than that from our spell haste gear now..<br />
<br />
This change is minor, barely noticeable, and will hardly affect your DPS or mine or (dammit) the warlocks.<br />
<br />
Also, go check around and do some research, rogues are high DPS in Hyjal and BT from what I've seen so far, like ridiculously high, not to mention they can now null and void the 1200 armor my mage DOES get..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dont worry about armor pen for pvp. if you see anyone with that much ignore armor they'll be an easy target to take down anyway and a joke for doing pvp with pve gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is unless you get ganked by a rogue in full tier 6 with twin blades of azzinoth.. (sadly there is one on laughing skull in Deus Vox, and thats what he does all day..)</div></div><hr />

Apparently - from the WWS data - on BT rogues can and do outdps mages by 30 to 40% average, although that &quot;average&quot; is only applied to top decked guilds (where the players are likely equiped with the best gear in the game available to them). Although I cba to do a statistical analysis of the data (not THAT bored - hate c&amp;p), by my random inspections, the top mage rarely goes over 1.2k sustained DPS, while lower (2nd/3rd) rogue usually stays at or above 1.1k. And although the dmg order does depend on the fight, it is not very common to see mages above rogues, while sometimes the top rogue does twice (100% + advantage) over the top mage. Maybe it is Furi (Blood legion) fault :P<br />
e.g: http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=yscdmpyujct21&amp;s=2506-2725<br />
<br />
Exceptions, blah blah blah, apply ofc, that being the impression I get from the overall picture.<br />
<br />
Anyway, basing whether the rogue dmg is too high by comparing to mages is probably a wrong, because they are not the ones competing with rogues for the top spots.</div></div><hr />
