A nice change has been made to the official site, http://beta.worldofwarcraft.com (http://beta.worldofwarcraft.com/) is now working ! Well it's not really working, but it's effectively redirecting people to http://beta.worldofwarcraft.com/game/character-copy.html (http://beta.worldofwarcraft.com/game/character-copy.html) on the server. Before yesterday it was only showing a 404 error, this could be the sign of an imminent opening of beta signups and it wouldn't be the first time something like this happens, the Wrath of the Lich King website was &quot;detected&quot; a few days before the Blizzcon using the same method.<br />

Frostmourne Replica auction closed - Highest bid reaches $20,700!<br />
A few days ago the Frostmourne Replica Auction (http://www.weaponmasters.com/auction/) has been closed, and the two highest bid were respectively ... $20,700 and $20,600 ! The 3rd bid only reached the ridiculous amount of $12,000. I personally find it a bit overpriced for a sword, even if it's Frostmourne, but that's probably because I'm a hunter and I don't really use my melee weapons right ? <br />
<br />
You can see the top 100 bidders on Blizzplanet.com (http://blizzplanet.com/news/2256/)<br />

02/04 Spotlight - BattleHeat<br />
The focus of our latest World of Warcraft Spotlight is Blacksmithing, not the profession in-game, but one of the oldest crafts and a major cornerstone in building our modern world. While the profession has been around for a long time it still has much to offer us and a small dedicated group of “real life” armor blacksmiths inspired by the World of Warcraft universe were eager to show the community just how much.<br />
<br />
We interviewed a member of the German workshop group BattleHeat, and talked about the creation of a paladin armor set, the challenges they face and their ideas for the future. Discover the heat of the battle and the ancient art of blacksmithing!<br />

Same thing I posted on worldofwar (who also brought up the PTR forum being down).:<br />
<br />
Blizzard does not use the PTR forum for the beta and alpha they use a entirely different forum with a entirely different link (believe it was forums.beta.worldofwarcraft.com before). Before the beta there would be a private Friends and Family alpha also which likely would not stay private for long before people were running around on sandbox servers of it just like for TBC. I doubt they would announce much of a beta at the WWI as Blizzard hates announcing things like that but it may start a bit after that if the alpha already began by then. It would be more likely to see them announcing a SC 2 beta at the WWI than WotLK though.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has been taking the PTR forums offline before bringing up the PTR lately to reduce spam and as they have said there will be a 2.4.2 thats probably whats about to come up.<br />
<br />
The best sign to watch for before there is a beta is for the F&amp;F Alpha to begin then you know the beta is soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With all due respect to the poster above, I would take the change to beta.worldofwarcraft.com as a very strong indication that the Friends &amp; Families Alpha test has started, as the exact same thing happened back then when the BC F&amp;F test started.<br />
<br />
This doesn't necessarily mean that a closed beta is happening soonish, but it is a sign of progress!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
BC beta lasted about five months, and I'm assuming WotLK will last about the same amount of time. That would make it's release around October if beta started within sometime in April, which would make some sense</div></div><hr />

They are likely preparing it yes but it is not occurring yet. If the alpha was happening we would know just like when BC entered its alpha.</div></div><hr />

The Alpha character copy and forum were under Beta.blahblahblah.com. Like the poster above me said if the alpha started already we would know. Blizzard tries to stop info form coming out, yet never really do. I don't remeber when the beta started it was around phase 4 or 5 of the alpha. <br />
<br />
If anyone remembers when the TBC hunter talents were released...it was the next day the beta started and the test forums became pure shit...like the WoW forums ate paint chips.<br />
<br />
I'd say the alpha is starting soon with the website and the accidental post on the forums about a new server immediately disappeared, something about it was really for internal testing...or so I heard.</div></div><hr />
