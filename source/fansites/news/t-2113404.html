Not all legendary items need to be useful on raid bosses - that thing was super buffed for pretty much all content outside of raid bosses...even then, could be useful on bosses with adds that can be interrupted/cc'd.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skoorb</div><div class="date">2016-11-15, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ALSO, keep in mind that they only posted TWO of the changes to current Legendaries, despite saying that there are &quot;Lots of changes to legendary items&quot;. Definitely more to come, hopefully means they're buffing some of the other crap Legendaries that aren't worth equipping. My friend plays a Shadow Priest and the Legendary he got (can't remember which one) was a 60 item level upgrade, but the stat optimization is so bad he said he couldn't equip it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't a small thing at all. What you speak of is what Mages were from Classic to MoP. That is the vast majority the game's history. The entire foundation of being a &quot;Mage&quot; is being a master of the Arcane. Like you said, they draw from all three trees of the Arcane, and then specialize in one to be a bit better in that specific tree (while still being able to use spells from the other two trees). <br />
<br />
What we have had since WoD on is more akin to Pyromaniacs, Icecallers, and Arcanomancers. True Mages, true purists, those who played Mage from Classic to MoP know what a travesty this is. We aren't Mages anymore. Haven't been for years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
currently the rank 1 melee spec n rank 2 dps spec amongst all the WoW classes, only right behind shadow priests is not a viable choice n garbage spec,LUL<br />
<br />
fire mage can cleave but they suffer heavily after the 6% pyro nerf, for single target they are in the middle of the pack now, 9th in rank and have no rank 1 logs. Arcane doesnt even have a proper rotation cause its balanced around having the bracer n pants legendary else mages would have already made the switch to use arcane for ST and fire for cleave, i would definitely do that, if only arcane is viable without the bracer n pants legendary.<br />
<br />
dont get why clueless player like u leaves comments like &quot;ton wrong with it &quot; but dont bother to list out whats actually wrong with the fury spec, the fury spec is really strong in m+ and all warrior specs have a purpose.</div></div><hr />

fire mage can cleave but they suffer heavily after the 6% pyro nerf, for single target they are in the middle of the pack now, 9th in rank and have no rank 1 logs. Arcane doesnt even have a proper rotation cause its balanced around having the bracer n pants legendary else mages would have already made the switch to use arcane for ST and fire for cleave, i would definitely do that, if only arcane is viable without the bracer n pants legendary.<br />
<br />
dont get why clueless player like u leaves comments like &quot;ton wrong with it &quot; but dont bother to list out whats actually wrong with the fury spec, the fury spec is really strong in m+ and all warrior specs have a purpose.<br />
<br />
Yeah Arms is 1st melee spec, only palas, enh shamy, ferals, rogues (2 specs), and dh are better than us. Damn even frost DK is higher on logs than we are ;) but Yeah that is ALMOST best melee spec. Stop misleading players by taking your info from simcraft Lol.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile this guy is talking like mages are weak... oh boy :d</div></div><hr />

Cool that u linked one fight where arms is good (pure st fight Lol). But like u can see we are 6th melee class in ToV with frost DK. Meanwhile u should check mythic en if u want to judge classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Everyone decent at this game knows that Arms can only pull big numbers when having both bis legis (ring and gloves) on a 100% uptime fight. Your whole &quot;argument&quot; about Arms and Arcane is a fukin joke and you should be ashamed of yourself. Stupidity becomes ironic.</div></div><hr />

Why do people only continue to give a shit about Patchwerk fights? There are 2-3 patchwerk fights out of 10 available bosses. Go ahead and filter by Odyn or Helya and come back to me with your Arms is numbah 1 comment. Arms is really good at ST. Arms is trash at any sort of cleave or sustained AoE. This makes arms overall an OK melee spec but far from the best because it isn't consistent. <br />
<br />
You can have an arms warrior tear up nythendra at 1st or 2nd, then turn around and get destroyed by that DH on every single other fight in EN. That's not what I'd call the &quot;best&quot; melee dps. The best melee dps is the most consistent one -- who is top 4-5 on most fights, not a couple.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, Arms is a good spec (when you have legendary rings/gloves), but it's not the best, at all. The ring/gloves really carried the Arms top end/ceiling and made the spec flow a lot more smoothly, so the nerfs to those two items hit it HARD -- the ceiling is going to drop significantly.</div></div><hr />

Fury warriors gets mobility :P but it is needed for pvp - quick getaway when getting hit, and also awesome for FC</div></div><hr />
