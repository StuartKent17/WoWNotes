Missing frost trait Relic in Tomb. Any reasons? Howling Blast relic havent been in raid since EN.<br />
There’s a Shadow relic with the trait you’re looking for, dropped by a boss whose name rhymes with &quot;Lil Maiden (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6454-Kil-jaeden-Guide-WoW-Tomb-of-Sargeras-Boss-Strategies-and-Loot-List)&quot;. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/864183702737240064))<br />
<br />
7.2 patch notes says you can right click class tokens to give you a set item. Not working with ICC tokens. Intended or bug?<br />
This is intended. The ICC tokens are valid for multiple slots, so you'll still visit the vendor to choose the one you want. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/864178058302963712))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
What are your thoughts on creating/designing rewards around the top % of players? As a player it feels like developers are afraid of making exclusive rewards in games hard to obtain, or only available for a short period of time, as the remaining x% (majority of playerbase) will never get to obtain said rewards. Which leads to a lot of the coolest rewards being easily attainable, thus making getting a really cool skin, or mount not feel rewarding as it was trivial to get, and everyone has it.<br />
I’m a big fan of exclusive, prestige rewards for the best players. Having something that aspirational has benefits I believe even for players who have little chance of ever earning them.<br />
<br />
That said, I don’t think it’s the right design to have great rewards for the best players and only hopes and dreams for everyone else.<br />
<br />
If you unpack player motivations for earning a piece of content, they usually fall out into buckets like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
I want to show off what a bad ass I am.<br />
I want to express what kind of player I am.<br />
The content has power and I need it to stay competitive.<br />
It’s something fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bullet 1 is definitely there to serve the top percent of players. Bullet 2 is less about recognition and more about communicating to other players about who I am. I’d be careful about locking those kind of rewards away to the top percent. You can get away with locking up a little bit of power under the justification that it gets more relevant at the more competitive upper end of the player base, but you have to be careful. Bullet 4 is where it’s easy to get into trouble where players are just in love with something (and not just because it symbolizes achievement). For category 4, I’d make the rewards highly available.

Build of the Month - May 2017<br />
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
All of the parts on this page are Amazon affiliate links. When you purchase your parts through them it helps support the site!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/may/ssdgraph.gif) are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale.<br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L7UZMAK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00L7UZMAK). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 7700K and would get more performance from spending that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Even so, there are so many things wrong with the parts discounting that they only link to Amazon.<br />
<br />
(Btw, they only linked to Amazon for these builds even before Amazon owned them)<br />
<br />
Puppy<br />
<br />
- Suggesting combining a $115 non-overclocking CPU with a $140 overclocking motherboard for the nth month in a row.<br />
- Suggesting a (however cheap) aftermarket CPU cooler despite the fact that the i3-7100 comes with one, and this is a budget build.<br />
- This build will draw nowhere near 600w of power. A 430w PSU would be more than adequate.<br />
- Paying the premium for fast DDR4 (3000) when again, this is a budget build with a non OC processor.<br />
- No SSD, which IMO is a must for any new computer build, budget or non.<br />
- a KabyLake Pentium is a much better buy than any i3 for the money. B&amp;H has a G4560 for $60. 10% less performance for almost 50% less money.<br />
<br />
Dolphin<br />
<br />
- Actually not terrible, but you could get a Z270 motherboard for less than $140<br />
- Again no SSD.<br />
- Regardless, probably the best value for the money out of these builds.<br />
<br />
Narwhal - <br />
<br />
- $120 for a 2TB HD? $60/TB is way too much.<br />
- Specs are very weak for a $1200 PC. Not everyone lives near a Micro Center, but for an example, $1000 will get you a PC with an i7-7600k, a GTX 1070, 16GB DDR4-3000, and a 480GB SSD from Micro Center. You know you're doing it wrong if you can get a prebuilt for cheaper than what you're putting together.<br />
<br />
Unicorn<br />
<br />
- Spending money in all the wrong places that won't really affect performance. For $1300+, you better at least be getting a 1070 and 7700k oriented build. The &quot;$1333&quot; listed price is with the GTX 1060. Plugging in the listed 1070 would bring this build to $1473. For that money, you could get a 1080 or even 1080ti/7700k build.<br />

The last two instances released (NH and CoEN) have both had Blast Radius shadow relics in them, so why on earth would the dude be asking about shadow relics? I mean, the Spellblade relic is pretty decent (3rd BiS trait) but there's not even a Cold as Ice relic (2nd BiS trait), because that comes in the form of a Shadow relic that drops from Chrono. I can see if they left the helm unnerfed why they would be averse to including BR relics in Tomb... but they nerfed the helm by 50%. Wat?</div></div><hr />

He really didn't word it well though, he said &quot;frost Trait relic&quot; which really could be taken as just a certain frost trait on a relic, he should have said frost relic with X trait to be clear. I took it the same way as the blue response at first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When making a guide for your lowest budget threshold one should tend to not worry about future proofing. You could swap the motherboard for a B250/H270, remove the suggested cooler, downgrading the PSU, going from an i7-7100 to a G4560 or G4620 could get you enough money for an SSD and maybe even upgrading the rx 460 to a 470/570.<br />
Also doesn't explain why you continue to pair unlocked motherboard with locked processors.<br />

<br />
Playing by the rules and only using amazon (us) prices, here is a much better Puppy build:<br />
<br />
Case: Rosewill SRM-01 - $31 (-28)<br />
EVGA 500B1 - $42 on Amazon (-6)<br />
G4560 - $76 on Amazon (-39) (their new pentiums have hyperthreading now, this is basically the same processor as the i3-7100 clocked slightly lower)<br />
Heatsink - Use stock cooler, its a budget build. (-25)<br />
Gigabyte B250-DS3H motherboard - $78 (-62)<br />
8GB Ballistix Sport DDR4 2400 Ram - $60 (can opt to go for 1 stick or 2 here. 2 sticks would get you dual channel, but 1 stick would make it easier to upgrade to 16GB later. They are the same price) (-14)<br />
Asus Strix Radeon RX 570 4GB - $200 (+100)<br />
WD Blue 1 TB - $50 (=) <br />
SanDisc SSD PLus 120GB - $55 (+55)<br />
DVD Asus 24x - $20 (=)<br />
<br />
So you'd get a slightly worse case, less future proof friendly, marginally worse processor, but much better current performance with an SSD and an RX 570 which is around TWICE as good as the RX 460 for $19 cheaper without giving anything big up. I don't think it will struggle at anything you throw at it at 1080p/60fps.<br />
<br />
And if you use other sites and/or wait for sales, you can do even better.</div></div><hr />

Thanks<br />
<br />
That $1200 build is superior to the $1333 Unicorn build. And if you up your budget to $1473 (Unicorn build with the 1070) you can sell the 1070 ($250, conservative estimate), buy a 1080 ($500, conservative estimate), and still have money to spare.<br />
<br />
If you're losing that bad to a prebuilt, you're doing something wrong. Again, not everyone has a Micro Center, but the build of the month suggestions just don't put enough money into meaningful areas. <br />
<br />
And lets not get into the lack of Ryzen processors mentioned.<br />

I really need a new computer. But I've decided to just wait it out for awhile. And I'm no expert on this, but wouldn't it be a bad decision to get anything less than 16gb of ram at this point?<br />
<br />
I personally don't feel good dropping below 16GB (current build has 32gb.. but i'll admit it's moreso just so it would be symmetrical) but for a budget build focusing on 1080p/60fps gaming it's probably fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The heatsink falling off after a year was a deal breaker? I'd imagine if not realizing it happened and it damaged your computer beyond repair made you angry. Technically you're suppose to check heatsink integrity every so often regardless, especially liquid-cooling.<br />
<br />
TBH I still don't really see why towers became so much more popular than standard desktop PCs, especially if you conceal/hide your computer. Perhaps it's cheaper and easier to vent vertical setups than horizontal, simply due to the nature of heat/air.<br />
<br />
You know what I'm really surprised didn't take off? horizontal setups with built-in flip-up monitors. It was very popular for consoles (PS1, PS2, GC, Original Xbox, PS3)</div></div><hr />

Nice build but the SSD is still sata. Not any faster than a &quot;regular&quot; non m.2 sata ssd. But again still better suggestion than the one in OP, and cheaper at that.<br />

I know I am still using a PSU I purchased 8 years ago because it still is working fine, it has lived in several different builds over the years, but I guess future-proofing is a personal preference.<br />

I'd imagine if not realizing it happened and it damaged your computer beyond repair made you angry. Technically you're suppose to check heatsink integrity every so often regardless, especially liquid-cooling.<br />
<br />
Honestly, that and a fried psu are the only issues I've ever had do I've been lucky<br />
<br />
TBH I still don't really see why towers became so much more popular than standard desktop PCs, especially if you conceal/hide your computer. Perhaps it's cheaper and easier to vent vertical setups than horizontal, simply due to the nature of heat/air.<br />
<br />
You know what I'm really surprised didn't take off? horizontal setups with built-in flip-up monitors. It was very popular for consoles (PS1, PS2, GC, Original Xbox, PS3)<br />
<br />
Oh, the mother board fried, only had three since then anyway, and asus has been good to me /shrug</div></div><hr />

All brands have a chance at random shit like that happening tbh, get it replaced and move on IMO.<br />

I guess they intend this PCs to only be used for WoW; where purely good Single core performance is all that matters.<br />

Even then I agree, why get a 7600K, when you can get the R7 1600 that comes with a free cooler that'll let to clock up if you so desire.</div></div><hr />

That's if you're gaming and running nothing else at all. I'm a tab freak in chrome, and it's currently using 28% of my total system memory, so just 9GB.<br />

This day and age I think 8GB is the minimum limit, with 16GB being a nice amount. Especially if you run more than just the single game and discord.</div></div><hr />

I know I am still using a PSU I purchased 8 years ago because it still is working fine, it has lived in several different builds over the years, but I guess future-proofing is a personal preference.<br />

Thanks for the reply again.<br />
<br />
I think its just kinda ridiculous how your budget from Dolphin &gt; Unicorn goes up $500 yet you're only going from a 3GB 1060 to a 6GB 1060 and keeping the same processor. I juist think you're putting too much money in nice to haves and not putting enough into things that will actually affect performance.<br />
<br />
I think Ryzen 5 deserves at least a mention alongside intel i5's. Swapping the 7600k for an r5 1600 on the Dolphin build saves you $20 on the processor, $25 on the heat sink, and ~$50 on the motherboard, gets you triple the threads, and you get a processor that will be much more future proof and better at everything (streaming, computing, recording, rendering) except single core performance, at the cost of slightly worse current gaming performance in games that value single threaded performance.<br />
<br />
Maybe for Puppy go for a true budget gaming build with little/no bells and whistles. Just a cheap, but current, build that allows people to play e-sport titles well, and new titles at 1080p with turned down settings. Something like a G4560/RX 460 or GTX 1050/8GB of ram, no SSD (but you can also suggest one), no aftermarket cooler, cheap (but reliable) PSU, b250/h270 motherboard, cheap case, etc. By cutting the bells and whistles you can make a serious budget build for people that are really restricted, instead of getting them to spend a couple hundred on things that won't impact current gaming performance whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Everything Dolphin and up should have a SSD imo.<br />
<br />
The Unicorn build should have an i7-7700k and a 1070 minimum. You're suggesting a build for people with a very high budget basically, shouldn't be cutting corners on the big ticket items, especially not in favor of an expensive cooler/PSU/motherboard/HDD.<br />
<br />
Just my suggestions. I don't mean to be a dick, but its not hard to imagine that some people use these guilds for their builds, and you're just not giving them very good advice.<br />
<br />
edit: I'd like to add that pigeonholing people into amazon only causes them to miss deals such as the incredible Gigabyte GTX 1080 8GB for $360 deal from Newegg this morning.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to go ahead and say that techspot is more credible than your anecdotal evidence. It is in no way shape or form a necessity to have 16gb of ram. If you are building a budget rig 8gb is perfectly acceptable. Even in mid range the computer forum tends to suggest 8gb in favor of putting the money elsewhere. 16gb is just tossing money for little to no performance gain.<br />
<br />
Edit: If you go to the second page they even test adobe premier cc, specwpc, and 7-zip. &quot;The only application we could find that really benefited from 16GB was 7-Zip, though we had to use a crazy big dictionary size to create heavy RAM demand.&quot;<br />

I'll second this.<br />
<br />
Having just built a new PC, first one in over 8 years and has to last another 8 years, I went with a Ryzen Build.<br />
<br />
Granted I spent far too much money (said the wife), I still went with as much future proofing as possible.<br />

it always show based on the spec im on.<br />
So if im on my ww monk and i want to see mw relic, even after switching, itll still show as ww.<br />
ive tried using loot spec, nothin. only when i change the spec does it refresh the book and i can see.<br />
<br />
btw just to be in the same page: i'm talking about trait the relic belongs to not whether or not if a different spec uses that 1 type of relic<br />
<br />
edit2: so in the other words, if my spec is holy and I mouseover a prot pally or ret relic it wont tell me what trait it belongs to for that spec not unless i change to those specs.</div></div><hr />

Also, if you read the article, your system may say its using X amount of ram but you'll see little to no performance loss with less ram. Read it before you reply.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also that may say 28% but it says pretty clearly its only using 1.8gb of ram on WoW</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's using 1.8GB on WoW, and rest on Chrome, Discord and other applications I have running.<br />
I stated that rather clearly.<br />
<br />
This a normal day. Even without WoW open, or production work, and just browser tabs and normal applications I'm using 24% ( 7.8GB ) out of 32GB.<br />
https://image.prntscr.com/image/72907ccad6a14608bb5002edcb28f70e.png<br />
<br />
I've tried doing my project work with less RAM, and it significantly increases the time of my encodes and completion. Easily from under one hour, to 2-3 hours. That's a big performance loss over all, and before I've had Adobe crash when running out of maximum system RAM.<br />
<br />
I have read it ( the article ), and I know how much my system uses; it's the reason I've upgrade my RAM to the amount it is.<br />
Otherwise as stated my system and workflow grinds to a halt. 8GB is the bare minimum anyone should get, and even than it can easily be used up right now simply with browsers, games ( 64-bit ones that aren't capped at 4GB usage), and a few other applications open. 16GB is the norm and recommended by most Tech and Gaming review sites, and YouTubers for a reason, unless your entire system budget is $650 or less</div></div><hr />

But that's not how chrome works. Chrome gives up resources for other processes for one.<br />
But this is going to be my last response. You say most tech and gaming sites this and youtubers that. You list anecdotal &quot;evidence&quot;. You've cited no sources, you take screenshots not understanding whats happening, and I don't think you really know the point you're arguing anymore.<br />
Its okay that you don't understand how ram works. Just don't tell someone they need to buy 16gb of ram when they don't. Its not bad to have 8gb. Its economical to put that money elsewhere and buy another 8gb down the road. <br />

<br />
It's clear you haven't read anything I've written, and yet you claim I don't understand what's happening. It must be why production work s and high end gaming systesm are all using only 8GB of RAM max right?<br />
<br />
I've shown you how much my average project uses, if that amount is more than the system has my Premiere Pro crashes.<br />
Even Windows 10 has errors just for that.<br />
http://i.imgur.com/qqKEJrB.png?1<br />
Your only source yourself is a 2015 article, where as most PC build guides will only list 8GB as the bare minimum, and for *budget* orientated builds, Techspot included.<br />
<br />
I also never once told anyone to buy 16GB when they don't need it, I said <br />
<br />
That's if you're gaming and running nothing else at all. * buying only 8GB*<br />
This day and age I think 8GB is the minimum limit, with 16GB being a nice amount. Especially if you run more than just the single game and discord.<br />
<br />
I stand by my point, and the fact that most build guides also include 8GB as the minimum, with 16GB being the *sweet spot* rather agrees.<br />
http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-pc-builds,4390.html#p2<br />
<br />
If 8GB was really enough, even for the highest end of gaming system; can you explain to me why every build guide there is, and review test bench includes a minimum of 16GB of RAM? Sure if 8 is enough for it all, it would be the standard everywhere?<br />
<br />
Techspot's own test bench in the latter half of 2016 &amp; 2017 features 32GB of RAM. Why? To eliminate bottlenecks when performing hardware reviews, as 8GB wouldn't be enough.<br />
<br />
We benchmarked Mass Effect: Andromeda using our Core i7-7700K test machine which sees the processor running at 4.9GHz with 32GB of DDR4-3000 memory. <br />
<br />
Your own system features 16GB of RAM instead of 8, surely you wasted your money then?</div></div><hr />

I just couldn't resist. <br />
Lets start from the top. The article is from November 2016. <br />
The link you put doesn't suggest 16gb til you get to the $1000 level.<br />
The original question was &quot;I really need a new computer. But I've decided to just wait it out for awhile. And I'm no expert on this, but wouldn't it be a bad decision to get anything less than 16gb of ram at this point?&quot;<br />
Let's use context clues. &quot;I'm no expert on this&quot;. We can infer this person does not use his pc for production. If he did he would know what his system needed.<br />
You are a minority in your pc usage. Congratulations. You're on a gaming forum.<br />
What they benchmark with is irrelevant. Do you think the everyday pc gamer has those specs?<br />
Yes my pc has 16gb. Because I built it like 3 1/2 years ago and had a good chunk of money. It was a mid-high end when I built it and ram would've been a perfectly acceptable place to save money until later. <br />
<br />
If you want to continue this I'd suggest making a thread in the computer forum.</div></div><hr />

Exactly so my points stand it seems.<br />

<br />
That's if you're gaming and running nothing else at all. * buying only 8GB*<br />
This day and age I think 8GB is the minimum limit, with 16GB being a nice amount. Especially if you run more than just the single game and discord.<br />
<br />
Including that 8GB is the minimum and only for budget orientated builds. If you're not on a pure tight budget why wouldn't you get 16GB then? Especially when in many cases the cost to double your RAM is very small; and there are not drawbacks in performance in the long run.<br />
<br />
Techspot <br />
<br />
The G.Skill Ripjaws V 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-3000 is unbeatable value at just $75. Given the price of memory today we upgraded to a 16GB kit whereas this time last year we went with 8GB.<br />
Having 8GB of RAM is the current base for gamers...<br />
<br />
What does Toms say in regards to 16GB?<br />
<br />
<br />
16GB of RAM was chosen to allow games that preferred more than 8GB to stretch their legs with the CPU and GPU.<br />
<br />
What they test with is always relevant, as it's essentially the best performance you can possibly get, without the extra bottlenecks; and 8GB would be one at the mid-high end.<br />
<br />
8GB is the minimum if you're only going to game and run a few applications like discord, and a few chrome tabs; but it is the minimum.</div></div><hr />
