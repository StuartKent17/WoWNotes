As promised, here is another batch of WotLK updates (and almost on time !). All the pages for 5-man dungeons had their summary greatly improved :<br />
<br />
Loot tables have been added. Screenshots for each items are available as well as links to the major item databases. Tooltips on mouseover have been added. Items are now sorted by type and spec.<br />
Quests have been added<br />
Achievements have been added<br />
<br />
The individual pages for each boss aren't done yet and will most likely be ready for tomorrow, along with ... What you're all waiting for. (Yes, raid instances, but listing 150 items in a same instance take slightly more time than 5-man dungeons)<br />
<br />
Also, you can contribute to the next update by : <br />
<br />
Pointing out errors, dead links, or anything useful.<br />
Posting missing strategies in comments, it's not like 5-man bosses are very hard and that's probably easy to explain<br />
Post decent videos for each encounter if you have them ... Just make sure the quality isn't too bad<br />
You can also mail me your screenshots if they're very nice. (1440x900 min resolution, very high details settings, no interface)<br />
<br />
The last one is just here for polishing but I guess it doesn't hurt to ask. And now ... the updated pages !<br />

Thats nice. Why should this be absurd?<br />
Now you can aim better for an item than just having luck with a loottable of 10 items per boss ...</div></div><hr />

I re-uploaded them to filefront again since I thought they might be of interest - although I'm not sure its 100% what you are looking for. I basicly recorded the whole instance and chopped it into segments showing both scenery, trash and bosses (with short explanations)<br />
<br />
Not the most professional videos ever created - but w/e :)<br />

Ulduar - Halls of Lightning: http://files.filefront.com/Ulduar+Halls+of+Lightningavi/;12309186;/fileinfo.html<br />

PS: I highly suggest that people refrain from streaming - the videos are in widescreen and filefront messes that up via streaming.</div></div><hr />

Thank you. My work blocked it as well.<br />

@ theniffrig <br />
reason its same model is to save some excitement for when u actually kill the boss and the item drops. Bliz will change the models once you install the expack. they use same model for beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess you didn't look at the class changes? There's no longer any difference between tanking leather and DPS leather, or at least that's the intent. They've stated explicitly, for example, that there will not be any leather pieces with bonus armor on them ever again.<br />
<br />
Also I haven't looked at the loot tables but I've heard it said there's no tanking plate either.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yhtomitn64</div><div class="date">2008-11-10, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The dungeons have lots of tanking plate in both epic and rare variety's. Also there are some nice blue tanking weapon drops which is cool because when BC came out lots of people were using Grim'Tor's charge and then Suneater before they got something better. Also there is an epic tanking weapon from the Heroics which will be sought after before people get Naxx gear and whatnot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to admit, I havn't read everything about the changes for wotlk (knew about the armour for druids though), so you might call this a wild shot, but won't you still need som def? Or are you supposed to get all def you need from rings/trinkets/neck? Still seems there should be some leather items with +def on them. Especially since blizz said that there will be better gear to tank in than PvP-gear, and I seriously doubt they'll somehow drop the need to be crit-immune.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I believe you can become crit immune just speccing into the talent 'Survival of the Fittest' meaning no +def required.</div></div><hr />

IE. Ramparts giving Honor Hold/Thrallmar rep up to honored.<br />
<br />
I know about the tabard wearing to gain rep with the faction you want at 80. I'm just wondering if in terms of rep-gain speed, grinding out the dungeons first before I do the quests will be faster.<br />
<br />
If so, could this info be added to the dungeon pages? Thanks!</div></div><hr />
