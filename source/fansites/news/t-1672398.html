World of Warcraft 10th Anniversary Ending<br />
The 10th anniversary celebration (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4530-WoW-s-10th-Anniversary-Event-Live) is coming to an end soon. You have until Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 10 a.m. PST / Monday, January 5, 2015 at 7 p.m. CET to get anything you may have missed.<br />
<br />
If you logged in at all during the event, the Molten Corgi (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/84915-molten-corgi) would have arrived in your mail. A successful run of the 40 player Raid Finder version of Molten Core rewarded a nice Core Hound (http://www.wowdb.com/items/115484-core-hound-chain) mount. The Hatespark the Tiny (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118574-hatespark-the-tiny) pet had a 10% drop rate and the Flames of Ragnaros (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118572-flames-of-ragnaros) weapon enchant transmog had a 2% drop rate (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/11502-ragnaros?drops-item-page=2&amp;drops-item-subtab=18#related:drops-item). Anyone that killed Ragnaros also got a spec appropriate item level 640 helm (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-icon=inv_crown_02&amp;filter-ilvl-min=640&amp;filter-ilvl-max=640&amp;filter-source=8&amp;filter-slot=2).<br />

Armory Stats - World of Warcraft 10th Anniversary<br />
We couldn't resist one more graph before the holidays are over and people (hopefully) return to work! There are 3.7 million characters and 2.4 million accounts that make up this sample. The percentage of players that have both the Alliance and Horde win in Southshore achievement is almost too small to see on the graph (0.01%).<br />

Unsure if this is a bug, but killed The Lanticore in H UBRS and no one in group was able to loot/roll. Did the droprate on the pet change?<br />
Droprates when loot is on Personal are different than when loot is on Group. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/549361090635644928))<br />
<br />
This expansion made inventory management worse. Toy box was one step forward and all the new stuff 5 steps back.<br />
What new stuff are you having trouble fitting?<br />
moroes' lucky polish. my inventory is fine save that one item.<br />
Fixed in 6.1 I believe! A few things missed the bus. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/549473206709395456))<br />

Many runs would make the group wipe for 20+ minutes on the corehound packs that have to die at the same time. 10% and 3% drop rate items in such an environment = hell. As a pet collector I gave up on getting Hatespark after 10 tries through this.</div></div><hr />

The battleground was poorly designed and seemed bugged most of the time(uneven A/H players)<br />
Not having a guaranteed way of getting the pet and enchant from MC was also a major punch in the face.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't jive with the comment that they intended for it to be ran once otherwise. Doesn't look like the uptake on the TM vs SS event was very high<br />

Also I think the stats/addon previews make for fine filler news posts during the slowest time of the year. Blizzards back in the office on Monday! Hopefully PTR within the next couple of weeks.</div></div><hr />

Sure, a few people died here and there, but it wasn't too bad overall. I was in queue for 3.5 hours to get in, and the run took a total of about 90 minutes. I didn't die because I knew enough to get away from the people that were like 'durr this is lfr. I don't have to move.' and ended up killing other people for it. Besides them I actually enjoyed myself. :)<br />
Btw, I hit level 100 on 11/17, and did it about 2 weeks later. So it was a bit earlier on, but not super early.</div></div><hr />

The original ruleset they went live with was ridiculous and luckily I only did that once. After they changed the win conditions, I was in a match that the Alliance actually had a chance of winning, and then with less than 5 minutes to go, the Horde were magically awarded 100 points and won. I'm not even kidding. It was so stupid. I think I finally won on the 4th try.<br />
Also, MC was kind of cool for about 30 minutes (assuming you found a competent group), and then you just want to get out of there. I've only done it twice and I don't want to do it again, but I'm going to try to do it at least once more so I can maybe get that damn pet. My friend who barely gives a shit about collecting things got the pet when I didn't. That always happens to me.</div></div><hr />

It's funny because the people who are called &quot;elitists&quot; don't comment on someone's gear or walk up and say &quot;I did more dps than you&quot;. No the people who get called elitist are not even 1/10th of what was shown yelling at Donald. But no, let's make it like there's a problem when the problem is the Donald's have merged with what they perceive to be the elitists. The real elitists are the bad players who demand everything be their way.</div></div><hr />

The BG was blood freaking awful though, in my experience. 1/4 of the group was hoping to just AFK and be carried, and roughly a 1/4 of the group was either bots or... well hopefully they were bots and not that damned stupid. Got my achieve (which I'm really suprised that so few players got it, 12% based on the sample, of the playerbase) and never touched the thing again, which I was sad about because I had high hopes for it.</div></div><hr />

The group I ran with didn't have any issues whatsoever and it was actually fun to see this updated.

Except, it was LFR. And a full group of actual raiders would have never &quot;faceplanted&quot; there. Hell, I even had one good run there, 90 mins, almost no wipes.</div></div><hr />

The battleground was poorly designed and seemed bugged most of the time(uneven A/H players)<br />
Not having a guaranteed way of getting the pet and enchant from MC was also a major punch in the face.<br />

there is a new battleground? just saw it now never seen it advertised once.<br />

Slap a quest/level requirement on them if they think certain items are too overpowered. Pet Charms should have gone to the currency tab. Gorian Artifact Fragments could go to the currency tab. Pretty sure I can find other items in my bag that could go to either currency or toy box.<br />

They put zero work into MC other than scaling it to current gear. I agree entirely, this should have been a fun event, not the generally awful experience it ended up being. I ran it once, didn't get the pet and bought it immediately, knowing both that I would not go back and that the price would skyrocket because very few people would run it more than once. This was no way to celebrate 10 years of WoW and for most of us was an very forgettable experience. They could easily have removed much of the trash or given us an xtra action button to remove our own debuffs to make this far easier and more enjoyable, but 2-3 hours of time for a so so helm and a slim chance at some vanity stuff, was never going to be enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. If they do anything (revamping old stuff for &quot;fun&quot;) like this in the future, I think I'll just skip out on it if I'm even subbed by then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I couldn't fucking understand why in God's name Blizz couldn't have just sent people immediately to fight Ragnaros... or give ALL bosses the chance for the pet and enchant. Speaking of all bosses, why the fuck couldn't they give all bosses a scaled up version of all the gear?<br />

<br />
TM vs SS It captured what TM/SS was back in vanilla... nothing but a zerg with no purpose.<br />
<br />
I almost think this entire event was Blizzard´s attempt to troll the people who talk about how great the game was back in vanilla, since in my opinion, both of these things were EXACTLY how they were back in vanilla. During MC, a ton of people would got AFK during trash. My guild actually did rotations where they allowed you to go AFK.. the goal was to make sure at least 30 people were always really there. If you weren´t on your ´break´ and you weren´t doing real dps, you didn´t get loot. TM/SS was always just a meaningless clusterfck. Just like this little BG, the only goal was to get as close as possible to the opposing town while killing people.. I guess this BG was different in that you didn´t have level 20-30 people getting one-shotted by the lvl 60s who were ´pvping´.</div></div><hr />

Huh? What major milestone was done better in WoW? 5th with Onyxia? Actually, that would be the only time they've celebrated a major milestone with anything other than a companion pet. You can say you didn't like the way they celebrated it, but saying it's lazy is silly. So I'm not sure what your complaint is there. The idea behind it was that if you wanted the mount, then you gotta go through some shit. And so what? Nothing mandatory about it. I've gone through a hell of a lot more for a mount, as I'm sure most players have.<br />
<br />
Oh, and according to the in-game calender (well, at least my in-game calender), they're restarting the anniversary event tomorrow running through next Tuesday. I don't know if that's an error, but I'm assuming it was extended to make up for the botched up ending time.</div></div><hr />
