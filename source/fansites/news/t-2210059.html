Group Finder Addons Changed<br />
Since the release of Patch 7.2, we’ve been working to resolve issues with realm performance that were causing players to experience heavy latency and/or disconnects on the Broken Isles. As our investigation has continued, we’ve discovered that many of these issues were being inadvertently caused by addons intended to automate the creation and joining of groups via the Group Finder, even for players who were not using those addons.<br />
<br />
Today, we’ve changed what addons can do when interacting with Group Finder, in order to address major performance issues with the game service for players— not just for those using these addons, but for others as well.<br />
<br />
In order to alleviate those issues, we’ve recently applied a hotfix that changes how addons interact with the Group Finder. Players will now need to give a manual confirmation when an addon attempts to:<br />
-	List and delist a Group Finder group.<br />
-	Search for and request an invite to a Group Finder group.<br />
<br />
Addons that are affected by these changes will need to be updated to comply with this new restriction. We understand that this is a relatively sudden change, but it was important to resolve the performance issues as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Note: If you are not using an addon that modifies the Group Finder feature, you should not encounter any issues resulting from this change.<br />

Brewmaster Feedback in Patch 7.2.5<br />
Lots of great feedback here on the latest build so far. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Latest thoughts:<br />
Spitfire - It's a fun playstyle option for people, but having both defensive (even without it being an increase to Hot Blooded, it's still more Elusive Brawler stacks) and offensive value (more Breath of Fires for damage), it's hard to fit it anywhere in the talent tree, and it complicates artifact trait values. We're going to just cut if for now (may return at some point in the future when it fits in better). Niuzao will return, and will simply deal more damage to make him competitive with the row.<br />
<br />
Blackout Combo - Yeah, the 2sec rotation is problematic. Some people like the frantic gameplay, but we think other talent combinations deliver on that better anyway. The main problems with it are that it invalidates a ton of other talent choices, actually *reduces* rotational choice because you just combo everything instead of having to choose what you combo, causes energy capping issues, is a massive buff to the talent potentially upsetting talent balance, and is too fast-paced without any other contribution. We're going to return it to 3sec, where you can pair it with other GCD-filling talents to create the frantic playstyle if you prefer, without causing the above issues.<br />
<br />
Hot Blooded and Dragonfire Brew - Baseline, Hot Blooded is very strong. 1% DR per bronze trait is already on the extremely strong side. The Legendary chest was created with Hot Blooded in mind as its defensive benefit. But that gets a little out of hand when we added 4th points to Bronzes, and you min/max relics, increasing it to the massively-OP level of 7% DR for a legendary. Then the 7.2.5 changes also add more Elusive Brawler stacks to that. We're going to adjust these two traits in order to better balance trait and legendary values: Dragonfire Brew will also increase the duration of Breath of Fire's DoT by 100%, giving it defensive value. Hot Blooded will now be active the whole time, instead of ~half the time without the Chest, and so is changing to 1% DR per point to compensate.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Overall Tuning - As always, overall tuning happens late in the process. Don't worry about overall power level of Brewmasters when giving feedback on these changes.<br />
<br />
Thanks all!<br />
<br />
I have a feeling theres a disconnect between how much the monk community value those elusive brawler stack and how the Developpers value them.<br />
<br />
First off, as said many times, dodge doesn't do anything VS magic damage or VS any kind of boss threatening ability as they are undodgeable even if physical (ex: spellblade annihilate).<br />
<br />
From a mythic raider point of view, those dodge stacks hardly do anything, as bosses auto-attack (the only thing that's dodgeable) are the least threatening form of damage we have to face.<br />
<br />
From a M+ dungeon point of view, those stack comes and go so fast nobody will notice the buff... having 100% dodge chance for 1 auto-attack out of the 5+ weak mob training you hardly change anything... <br />
<br />
It's also one of the reason people hardly, if ever, use blackout combo to empower purify.<br />
We value it based upon its actual real world value, not a theoretical worst case that doesn't actually exist. You should too.<br />
<br />
Yes, Elusive Brawler does nothing against Magic/undodgeable damage. However, apart from some extremely niche situations like Star Auger, it's not that piercing damage alone that kills you; it's the combination of those and other damage that is dodgeable. Nowhere is this more true than on Brewmasters, where there is no spike damage, only smoothed total damage (which is mostly auto attack damage). Mastery drastically reduces the total damage you take, which is the only thing scary to a Brewmaster anyway.

<br />
Sounds unrelated.<br />
Connectivity, particularly latency in terms of responsiveness is what would be affected here.<br />
FPS is a local performance issue, either due to wow or other factors in your PC.<br />
Hardware, Software, Addons, Graphics settings, etc.<br />
<br />
A new thread would be a better place to have that conversation.<br />
Start in the Interface and Macro's area perhaps.<br />

Although I disagree with API pruning. You don't really need a WQGF to do WQs. Blizzard Premade groups are already enough for you.<br />

<br />
That's...kinda the point. They are intending to at least reduce the defensive value of the chest. Right now, it is far and away the most powerful legendary for BM for survivability, making it effectively mandatory. Converting it into an almost entirely DPS legendary with a bit of secondary utility as far as snap aggro on AoE packs is a good change.</div></div><hr />

LFD/LFR are always too toxic. I don't even get any surprised WQGF will auto-kick low dps players in the future.<br />

Then you must play a different game than I do, because I can always group up for any quest I like, at least when other people are also looking for groups. If they don't then the game is not to blame.</div></div><hr />

Pay attention to fog effects (or any textured object with partial transparency, such as the star dome in the DH class hall), and see if these are the culprit. A fight like Xavius is virtually unplayable for me.</div></div><hr />

The problem was when there is a world boss up. People would make an auto accept group, boss would die and the group would stay on. Couple of people leave, looking like the group needs 2-5 people at 35~ so new people instantly queue and are auto accepted. Then slowly the rest that already killed the boss leave the group while staying on the same shard while new people constantly get invited to the same shard which keeps pouring people to the same shard.</div></div><hr />

I just love those salty tears of people who were automating parts of the game and are now sad that it is taken away from them.<br />
<br />
Sorry that we played an MMORPG together with other people. <br />
<br />
GW2 is now 5 or so years old, and it had auto grouping / not requiring grouping for their WQs right from the beginning. Auto grouping should be a basic feature.</div></div><hr />

Clearly it did now. Whether it spiked in popularity or something else happened doesn't matter, if the addon is the cause of additional stress on the servers then reducing its impact is to be expected. They did the same thing with gearscore if I recall correctly.</div></div><hr />

I recall the first review of GW2 that I read. It mentioned that you don't need to interact with people, that it loses any need for social interactions.<br />
Whether that's good or bad probably depends on the player. But I wouldn't say that having everything automated in a way that it doesn't matter if the party members are human or AI is the staple of an MMO.</div></div><hr />

Nope, it removed the stress of tagging mobs. All mobs, collectables, etc. were quest zone wide shared with everyone. Reducing toxic behaivor you've now with Sentinax, or without WQGF.<br />

<br />
Not quite, they broke the gearscore addon and allowed you to see your own item level and possibly others via armory, or in cases where both have an addon which communicates with each other in the same group. Prior to that the gearscore addon was scanning anyone you mouse-overed which caused stress on the servers.<br />
<br />
If you're asking them to implement this functionality into the base game, that's something they could possibly do in the future, but not at this short notice.</div></div><hr />

How is removing invasions a solution? There's probably plenty of people who enjoy that content for various reasons, I used it to level up my alt (gives 6 times the xp of regular quests or something).</div></div><hr />

The addon is correct, because it relied on automatically creating groups and listing them. You can still use Blizzard's default Group Finder UI; however, this only shows up for the higher tier quests with the gold star around them. If they extended this feature to all of the world quests, it would be just fine. No addon necessary.<br />
<br />
You can also right click and select Find Group, but with no automated group creation for specific quests, it's unlikely you'll find very many.</div></div><hr />

You (as well as many others) seem pretty clueless. Servers have not been in the same &quot;world&quot; for a long time, every player is in a shard and shard can have players from any realm in the region. Realm population has nothing to do with who you run into.</div></div><hr />

Okay, so why, when I'm on Shadowmoon, do I see more horde than alliance? I'm not pretending I know everything, but when I change shards and end up with guys from other servers I see different population balances. Could you explain it to me better? Maybe I'm missing something.</div></div><hr />

Is this supposed to be a joke? Popping in and out of groups to complete world quests by afking around is now &quot;playing with other people&quot;?<br />
<br />
If only this game still promoted ACTUAL group play that would be great. And I mean with strangers, I don't mean grouping up with your guild to fight the same boss for 3 hours or smash a dungeon you did a trillion times except now the mobs do 384% more dmg and explode when you look at them.<br />
<br />
But I guess raising any concern about these things will immediately have me labelled as a hater and &quot;toxic&quot;.<br />
The thing is, everyone has many many memories of making and MAINTAINING friendships ingame with people they met while questing or while trying to form dungeon groups during vanilla and BC, can you be 100% honest and tell me when was the last time this happened to you?<br />

Have you tried doing a danger rare elite with like &lt;800 ilvl? That person might have been referring to those. Not everyone using this thing just AFK'ed worldquests, because if everyone did, nothing would have gotten done.

Since people will actually have to sift through a lists of similar titles, almost everyone will tunnel in on the 3-4+ groups and outright ignore the single player seed groups unless they're the only choice there is. WQGF, being random/first come first serve style of finding a group to my knowledge, had all groups treated equally for invite priority unless users manually joined them. <br />
<br />
Blizzard should update the current questing tool to make their individual questing groups like the LFD/R tool where you have less control over who you end up with, but will quickly get you in, take out the objectives, then back out into the world onto the next quest.</div></div><hr />

However the invasion leveling, something is just way off about the mobs and the damage they do. Leveling characters have quite a struggle from my experience. But like someone pointed out, isn't this a mmo after all, isn't one of the goals to actually GROUP and play with OTHER people? It just feels like the whole idea behind the world quests was that they were meant to be SOLOED when a &quot;nerf/fix&quot; like this comes along.
