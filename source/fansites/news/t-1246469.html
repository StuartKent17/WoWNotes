Patch 5.2 - Warlock Island<br />
It isn't clear where this island will be used, if at all, during the new Warlock quest line (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/classes/warlock?filter-expansion=5) for green fire. The sky is similar to the one used in the Black Temple, where most of the quest line takes place. The second part of the Island is just a copy of the Maw of Neltharion (http://www.wowpedia.org/Maw_of_Neltharion).<br />
<br />
Don't forget that this is not ready or intended to be previewed, is not a 100% accurate preview, and is likely to change before release.<br />

<br />
Patch 5.2 - New Heirloom Items<br />
Patch 5.2 adds several new Heirloom items (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=16408&amp;filter-quality=128) that scale to level 85. These are upgraded versions of current heirlooms and can be purchased with the old heirloom and Justice Points. <br />
<br />
The Justice Points cost is the same as it is for the level 80 version (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-expansion=4&amp;filter-quality=128&amp;filter-slot=2359278). The new shields cost 2175 Justice Points.<br />

PTR Access – Known Issue<br />
We’re aware that some players are having connection issues when attempting to log into the Public Test Realm. We’re investigating the issue with our QA and development teams to resolve the problem.<br />
<br />
Please be aware that our Customer Support department cannot assist with issues pertaining to PTR access, or upgrading your current PTR account's status. If you have an open ticket we’d appreciate you closing it and waiting for further updates here regarding resolution of the issue.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for the reports and for your patience. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/249948-ptr-access-known-issue/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7591979213?page=1#1))<br />

Patch 5.2 and Conquest Points<br />
As far as I can tell we still haven’t released information about when the current arena season will be over.<br />
<br />
But whenever a season ends, Conquest Points usually reset, and get converted to Honor and/or gold when above the cap. You can probably expect the same thing to happen this time, but we’ll provide more exact information when we get closer to the end of the season.<br />
<br />
Don't worry too much about it, we always put out some news whenever a PvP season is about to end with at least 1 or 2 weeks’ notice. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/249874-52-patch-and-qp/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6297800782?page=1#4))<br />

Elegon Hotfix<br />
This specific hotfix requires realm restarts, which have not happened since it went in. The fix should be picked up with maintenance next week. Sorry about the confusion!

LFR to See Content<br />
If you're pressed for time and your goal is to see and experience raid content, LFR(Looking For Raid) is available and a relatively accessible way to experience that content. The item levels dropped from LFR isn't as high end as those from Heroic modes, but your character's item level doesn't have to be the sole barometer of how much fun you're having. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/249790-not-a-raider/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7414956808?page=4#71))<br />

What is the ETA for Stormwind and Orgrimmar Repairs?<br />
With the majority of stone and lumber being sent to the various war fronts for construction and repairs, there's essentially nothing left for the craftsmen to work with. In fact, the laborers seen toiling over the constructions are not actually doing anything. We've told them they can go home, or volunteer for Pandaria duty, but every day they climb up those ladders, and every day slowly hammer at boards and walls to no effect. They take their lunches in solitude, sometimes taking a break to stare at the sun, and at the end of their shift they climb down and go home. <br />
<br />
They've repeated this every day for over two years. We're quite worried about them. Top men are currently investigating the possibility of providing them with twigs and small rocks with the belief that some progress may snap them out of it. <br />

Future<br />
How about next raid content? İt will be a equal quality with ulduar and sunwell?<br />
I'm pretty excited about it personally, but I don't want to overpromise anything. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281531121714466816))<br />
<br />
Wasn't the Void Storage feature supposed to work WITH the Transmog, so we could transmog things that are in the Void Storage?<br />
It was designed to work the way it does, but not having to move stuff out of VS is a common request we're considering. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280723005955514368))<br />
<br />
So, going by the information available as of now, 5.2 will once again be a 5 months wait?<br />
Was 5.1? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279762074761060352))<br />
5.1 was supposed to be launched with Mists. It was cut and &quot;masked&quot; as a patch to combat GW2. 5.2 isn't like that.<br />
I think you greatly overestimate our ability to hit a target date even if we paid that close attention to competitors. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280717237017538560))<br />
<br />
2. try: is there a chance we will ever see flying combats / air pvp ? maybe as a bg or open world ?<br />
Pretty unlikely TBH. It would take huge changes to our combat engine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281530772815499264))<br />
<br />
Are you guys still kinda working on that thing that has spells land on different parts of the target's body?<br />
Yeah. It won't be anytime soon though. It's a big project. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281522272966160384))<br />
<br />
What about the resource-collection part of the War Effort? That does't concentrate players in one spot.<br />
Yeah, the overall feel of that was pretty cool. Not sure farming Linen was, but a neat idea to revisit someday. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281861043804835840))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
You make raids for 2 or sometimes even 1 tank out of 25 people and wonder why there aren't more tanks...<br />
There were few tanks even back when the majority didn't raid. It's the responsibility IMO. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285137968140791808))<br />
<br />
Why were the fully raid buffed DPS dummies not implemented on live servers - only PTR? Intention behind this?<br />
We don't want players to obsess with theoretical DPS. Who wins a target dummy doesn't actually mean anything. On PTR it's to help us. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279064255775510528))<br />
But that's punishing the theory crafters who hate using sims but would rather the real thing; over a dumb epeen contest<br />
I'd argue that the dumb contest would do more damage to the game than better theorycrafting would bring. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285160201231953920))<br />
<br />
LFR is awful. What happened to encouraging people to do content with friends and guild? Another blow to alts as well.<br />
I 100% believe you will have more fun and stick with the game longer if you play with friends. LFR is for when you can't. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285155117248950272))<br />
<br />
also do you have anything in mind for pvp power to enhance heals outside instances? world-pvp being so important now<br />
Unless something changed recently, PvP Power does enhance heals in the outdoor world. Just not in instances. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285147327960846336))<br />
<br />
linear progression was the worst idea you ever could return to.. you leave behind lots of alt-players and returners.<br />
We understand that. But the alternative is that other players feel their accomplishments have no meaning if rapid catch up exists. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285146067228561408))<br />

If the heirloom stretch was to 90, it might be worth it. But otherwise, I see no real point in doing this. Cataclysm levels are already insanely fast without any BoAs. Really hoping Blizzard changes this.<br />
Yeah I am not 100% sure what is going on yet.<br />
<br />
As you say changing them for 1-90 would be very nice and might justify the cost (I do still doubt it though!).<br />
<br />
Maybe they are introducing &quot;or&quot; payment so you can trade in old item or pay the JP.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what is going on with it at all, PTR is PTR I guess.</div></div><hr />

About the new heirlooms, no way I will be able to afford it, running dungeons are so boring... (But remember, you can just send them over to an alt you've leveled up and ran a few HCs to gear up, bet you got some JP laying around there you can spend)</div></div><hr />

I really wish those prices aren't final. Make the ''''upgraded'''' heirloom items cost somewhat more than the originals, AND have a big discount (50% at least) if you have the previous item! That way, if you don't have the original heirloom, buying the upgraded version would be cheaper than if you just bought the original and then upgraded it.</div></div><hr />

To reach JP cap, you need to run 25 heroic dungeons (assuming 4 bosses per H dungeon), and if you want to buy, say, the Agility heirloom staff from scratch? That's MORE than 25 dungeons of JP grinding since their price combined (original + upgraded) is higher than the weekly cap.<br />
<br />
Suppose your average player wants to start an alt. A mage. And he wants the heirloom. Now, assuming he wants to buy just one trinket, we have: the staff (3500 jp), its upgrade (3500 jp), the shoulders (2175 jp), its upgrade (2175 jp), the chest piece (2175 jp), its upgrade (2175 jp), the trinket (2725 jp) and its upgrade (2725 jp). That gives up a whooping total of... 21150 justice points! That a LOT of justice points! Not to mention the same average player probably upgraded one or more rare-quality items to reach the minimum item level to start running LFR, so there's 1500 or 3000 JP ON TOP of those prices.<br />
<br />
Now you may say: &quot;You don't HAVE to buy the upgrades from the very start! You can wait until your alt is near 80 to do so!&quot; To which I give you this: Ok, so the price to buy all the 'normal' heirlooms is of 10575 justice points. That's STILL a lot of grinding. And here's the kicker: with the time you'll spend on your main grinding those 10575 Justice points ALL OVER AGAIN, you'll probably would have already gone from 80 to 85 on your alt, replacing the level 80 heirloom with normal gear, and may already be well into level 86 already, if not 87.</div></div><hr />

Who needs heirlooms anyway, honestly? It's not like it takes that long to level an alt without them.<br />

Even if you just use the regular ones, how long does 80-85 take? Not that big of a deal.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, I don't think that's even the worst. It's just that paying the same amount of JP as the original item just isn't worth it for 5 more levels. If it lasted up to 90, MAYBE it would be worth that much. Maybe. Even then, I don't think it would be. We're effectively paying for the heirloom twice just to have it work for 85 levels as opposed to 80. These 5 levels are fast enough without heirlooms, I don't honestly see a lot of people who really want to level an alt bothering with farming justice just for that, and rightfully so: it isn't needed OR worth it.<br />
Honestly I don't care if it stays at this price, I don't have to buy them, but it doesn't mean I won't find it silly as hell.</div></div><hr />

No, but the heirlooms' +% XP buff speeds up the process a bit, and also the heirloom items provides you with considerably more powerful stats than what you'll find from quests and dungeons loot of your alt's level, which would, in turn speed up the leveling process even more, coupled with the XP buff. Almost +50% xp is not something to sneeze at, if you have the JP (and TIME!!) to afford them.</div></div><hr />

farming justice points isn't actually very easy, everything gives you valor these days and it's not until you've capped valor that you get some justice. i dont play enough these days to cap valor and then have time to make justice points on top. <br />
<br />
i've already got a full set of heirloom weapons and like hell am i gonna bother attempting to farm up more justice for an extra 5 levels of item scaling. i hope this is just a temporary ptr price...<br />
<br />
tbh i'd gladly trade in my old one and some gold to get it upgraded, but trading in the old one + more justice points is just silly, i dont think i have 2000 justice points across my entire account (let alone 3500 for the staff), it's all valor points - is there anywhere you can actually farm justice these days? or am i right that it's only available after capping valor for the week?</div></div><hr />

Hell being a combination isn't that bad, it's just the amount of justice that's way too high.<br />
<br />
It's still PTR, and for all we know, they could have simply not adjusted the costs yet (the fact that all the costs are exactly the same as the base heirloom plus the base heirloom itself gives this some credit). But as it stands now, they're not worth the price.</div></div><hr />

While that statement is true, even you must admit that the pricing given to the 'upgraded' heirlooms are way out of the norm. It's like going to the car dealership:<br />
You: &quot;I want to buy this car.&quot;<br />
Vendor: &quot;Awesome! That will be 8000 dollars!&quot;<br />
You: &quot;Can I use my current car as part of the payment?&quot;<br />

I don't honestly believe a lot of people will be outraged if these prices go live (except those who bitch and are outraged by anything). I personally don't care: don't like it, don't buy them, they're not required at all. But you do have to admit, 5 levels of extra XP for that much JP isn't worth it at all. I usually defend most of Blizzard's decisions, and while this one has little to no impact on the game, it's kinda silly to introduce something if most people will probably not even bother with that. The time used to farm the JP would be better used just leveling the alt. Perhaps in the last tier people will be swimming in JP and be able to buy these without a second thought, but not now.<br />

And it took me a great while to get them. I think it's also a prestige to gather them (cause it takes quite some time), but with these changes it's just like doing all the effort again for a small addition. It would be different if it gets an extra spell effect (not cosmetic, but something like a haste proc or anything) than it would be viable to gather the JP for it. I think with these additions, I won't take the effort to upgrade these heirlooms. JP and VP gathering is already very slow atm, the amount of JP from hc dungeons is way too low (35 per boss, in Cata 70), plus you don't get JP from LFR. To reach the hard cap of 4000 JP you need to do around 70 normal dungeons (per week) or (considering 4 bosses per hc dungeon) 28 hc dungeons (per week). So for 1 item you need to do (say 2000 JP) 14 hc dungeons. Count the amount of items, it will take almost as much time as grinding MC rep.<br />
<br />
My solution is, scale those items up with no costs. Or put an extra proc and cosmetic upgrade on it, then it will be viable to grind for it. (An achievement for gathering all the items would be dull)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The prices are high and likely not worth it. On the other hand: During the last 3 months I spent several justice points on buying items to just make (almost wortless) shards out of them cause I was close to the cap. So even those heirloom prices are better than that. If you are not raiding 2 or 3 days a week then you have the choice of heroics or LFR for Valor...and given that heroics give almost as much valor but are faster to do(if you include the waiting time even more so) I can imagine that during the remaining 2 years of this expansion it will be quite common to run heroics. <br />
I can just speak for me, but I just gained the last item from lfr that was useful for me...untill 5.2 there is just not much reason left for me to go lfr(unless I don't manage the valor cap...and valor is always needed thanks to upgrading), especially given that the players on lfr seem to get lazier by the day(&quot;uh we outgear that encounter...why moving at all? The others can do the adds. I keep eating my pizza and use my 2 spells.&quot;).<br />
<br />
We just shouldn't forget that the expansion will still last for a very long time...and we don't need all heirlooms tomorrow. I just hate the idea that they will do this every expansion now....upgrade heirlooms by 5 levels....again...and again...and again....</div></div><hr />

Hey if an Old God can go renegade why can't a demon?<br />

In response to all the posts about how hard it is to get JP, if Blizz doesn't lower the JP cost for the new heirlooms, one way to get JP quick is to have a character twinked at 85(i.e. - stop gaining XP) and then just keep queuing up for random Cata dungeons/heroics. It might be possible with WOTLK as well(level 80 twink), but I'm not sure if those instances still grant JP to level-appropriate characters.</div></div><hr />

So warlocks get a reused Ragefire Chasm (May be miss spelled, ally player here..)? Looks like the rest will be cool though<br />
<br />
About the new heirlooms, no way I will be able to afford it, running dungeons are so boring... (But remember, you can just send them over to an alt you've leveled up and ran a few HCs to gear up, bet you got some JP laying around there you can spend)<br />
<br />
Rogues dont have a speculated expansion dedicated to them and their source of power either. Burning legion returns 2014.</div></div><hr />

Those new Heirloom item prices are again way too expensive, should be like one digit less or something (i.e. 3500-&gt;350 JP). Heirlooms were way too expensive when they were first released and now the same situation is happening again, seriously Blizz?</div></div><hr />

If they want to make them expensive to purchase they shouldn't make those who already spent countless hours and JP's getting them in the first place have to do so all over again just to &quot;upgrade&quot; them 5 more levels. If this holds and is in patch 5.2 Blizz I may be less inclined to play WoW more than ever. I already have all the currently existing jp's so I don't need them. But this continuous meaningless crap they keep adding to eat away at the players' time is leaving a sour taste in my mouth. Add some &quot;fun&quot; things for goodness sake!</div></div><hr />

Only 85? Same ridiculous prices with MoPs 1/4th JP rate of cataclysm? Pure stupid.<br />
<br />
During 4.3 I burned untold amounts of jp sell twink gems or primordial saronite. (4.0/4.1 JP was useful)<br />
In MoP I filled all my slots with better than JP gear before I even got near the cap, the whole low ilvl 450 and reputation insult at launch sucked too. 458 is still dumb, should be 463 period.<br />
<br />
Hell given how you can get some MoP ilvl blues as early as level 80 and they blow these out of the water AND some are good to 90 who would waste their time earning jp? Farm gold and hit the AH. 80-85 since reduction is actually really quick, a good Cata quest pattern is better than MoPs.<br />
<br />
At least they FINALLY added shields, not sure why it took two entire expansions to figure that out, not rocket science. Forgot about offhand still...<br />
<br />
Current heirlooms should be made 1-85 for free full stop. Then add an upgrade option for 90s, and 3500 jp way too high when I can buy a 425/442/450 weapon cheap.<br />
The arch boa items are 463 and can even be upgraded to 471! (polearm is amazing for monk/druid/dk/war/paladin, agility be damned, offhand is decent for casters, trinket is not bad for anyone)</div></div><hr />

Yeah this really does not make any sense the way it is on PTR at the moment maybe they are setting it up so that is how it will work?<br />
<br />
Who will pay 3k JP for 80-85? 85-90 sure I would maybe bite on that! :)<br />
<br />
Worth remember JP will be much easier in 5.2 as well (any excess VP will be converted to JP)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The cost of the new heirlooms (1-85) is going to be EITHER 1500 JP OR trade-in the old one and get the new one.<br />
<br />
I love reading the stupid comments from players crying about stuff that is barely on the PTR.<br />
<br />
Another really interesting fact is that heirlooms generally have stats based on the expansion you are in. So for instance, at lvl 58, a green item from BC will actually have much better stats than your heirlooms.<br />
<br />
This principle is expanded greatly with 80-85 because there are so many incredible MOP rare items that have level requirements at 81. Those type of items will be far superior to what a lvl 81 heirloom is. A lvl 81 heirloom might be ilvl 330 or so.. there are plenty of ilvl 442 rare items from MOB that a lvl 81 can use. My monk is not there yet, but I have been buying up MoP gear for him to use from 80-85. I know I have an ilvl 442 weapon he can use at 81 and a few other items with ilvls above 400. Even with slots that have exp bonus, 100 ilvls is a lot to pass up.</div></div><hr />

You are missing the entire reason behind heirlooms, it is the exp bonus not the stats; 45% additional exp is huge for leveling.</div></div><hr />

I rather go level my alt instead of farming JP for hours. In the time I can farm 7k JP for 20% extra xp for level 80-85 I can just level my alt from 80 to 85. Unless I am planning to use these heirlooms on at least three characters or I am JP capped by doing things I was already going to do anyway it's very unlikely I will upgrade them if the price stays like this.<br />

To keep us busy by making us farm more JP. Like it is fun to do even more mindnumbing heroics.<br />

I wonder how they are going to do this next tier and the tier after that. Do they really expect us to keep running these stupid heroics the whole expansion?</div></div><hr />

And then to think people rly want to farm mindnumbing heroics with a tabard equipped :)<br />
Farming the JP will be quicker then the leveling. And hopefully they drop the prices a bit.</div></div><hr />
