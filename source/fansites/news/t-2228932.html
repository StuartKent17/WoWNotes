Why does a random green set have new item IDs? Also, I'm curious what transmogrifiable gear will be purchasable using the Trial of Style token. I'm personally hoping that it will be a mix of new appearances as well as appearances that may be unobtainable by this point in time. Or, at least, higher definition versions of old appearances that properly fit the new dimensions of player character that were added in WoD. (I have some appearances that I really like... but don't transmogrify to them because the art texture gets stretched and/or condensed on HD player models.)</div></div><hr />

I think you just answered your own question about the Trial of Style rewards -- presumably that random green set is one of the rewards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fixing that by tweaking the aura (when the 0% are the current value anyway), then that is just.. weird.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That means an item level of 885, bah... a bit disappointing for who invested in professions.<br />
<br />
They could have it improved a little bit, considering that LFR drops 885-895+ ilvl with procs.</div></div><hr />

That is item level 115, not required player level.</div></div><hr />

Do we not get a 3 % buff to some of our abilities? I think the nerf of &quot;Blast Radius&quot; is just common sense. One relic should not completely outshine the others.</div></div><hr />

Just delete your account you toxic fuck. It was a 3% nerf to t19 when we're getting t20.</div></div><hr />

If you go to the PTR datamining on wowhead for the buff (http://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=137006/frost-death-knight) we can clearly see the listed skills in the patch-notes. BUT there is a &quot;see more&quot; page button here aswell that lists ALL of the skills. If this is the source of the data then this clearly states that all of the Frost DK skills are getting a 3% buff and not only the ones listed here on wow-head.</div></div><hr />

Ice and arcane look solidly middle of the pack, fire looks to tie or lose in aoe to arcane, and it will be so far below all other specs in ST it will be a meme.</div></div><hr />

Seems to be and error in the patch notes. Check the data-mined ptr-build on Wowhead. All of our abilities are listed as 3% buff there.</div></div><hr />

(For Frost DK)<br />
That is just even better! I dont understand players whining about Blizzard wanting to balance our relics. Right now they could might as well just remove all others than Blast Radius because it is the only relic we are using. I like the changes.</div></div><hr />

Yea I know right. I love that they have nerfed it. Just the notion of running BRH over and over to get 2 relics made me almost puke :P</div></div><hr />

Affli was way overtuned, this will hopefully tune them down from god tier.</div></div><hr />
