The review of moderator applications is now finished! It definitely took much longer than expected and we almost got 400 applications from users who wanted to help, about 40 of them will be accepted and promoted as moderator in a few days.<br />
<br />
People who are accepted as a moderator will receive a private message from me with more details on what to do. If we refused your application please do not take it personally, we refused some of them for tons of various reasons, in a lot of cases good posters didn't make it because they weren't active enough on forums, etc ... I'm still glad that so many people applied to help on the forums and even if you didn't make it, your efforts are appreciated. <br />
<br />
The increased amount of moderators will allow us to make sure that things stay under control on forums and should allow a couple of extra features that I couldn't deploy earlier without causing total chaos. The amount of users and posts on the forum increased dramatically over the past few weeks and I'm glad that more and more people are joining our little community! <br />

<br />
During the next few days, the Cataclysm and World of Warcraft forums will be merged in a single category after the release of the expansion. Hopefully, I will also have some time to expand the Off-Topic forum section and I'll try to find a way to make them accessible from the front page. (Probably with a simple filter on the latest forum posts box, or something like that)<br />
<br />
Also, if you want to see extra WoW or Off-Topic forums, now might be the right time to bring it up in the comments of this news post.<br />

Season 9 - PvP Armor Sets Final Preview<br />
Someone pointed out that I never posted a preview of the final models of the Season 9 Armor Sets, I'll probably have time to do multi-races at some point but I'm not going to promise it, I still have tons of work to do before the release of the expansion. (Also, I'm pretty sure the Rogue set is still bugged ... not sure if that's a bug on my side or not, can't seem to fix it)<br />

&quot;What Wrath players need to know to not suck at Cataclysm&quot;<br />
Daetur posted a very interesting post on the forums: What Wrath players need to know to not suck at Cata! (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/795945-What-Wrath-players-need-to-know-to-not-suck-at-Cata!) I'm not going to front page the whole thing but you might want to read it if you're not sure if you will survive Cataclysm's raiding. <br />

The Daily Blink - Mage Monopoly<br />
I don't think I ever posted something from The Daily Blink (http://www.thedailyblink.com/), their comics are usually decent and I'll try to feature them on the front page more often in the future. <br />

It's just unfortunate that the people that the thread's aimed at is simply going to whine that it's &quot;elitists getting on my case&quot; and likely they'll just QQ at Blizzard until they nerf the new Cataclysm 5-mans to mindless 20-minute zergfests.<br />
<br />
Instead of, yanno, playing the game how it's designed to be played and accepting help and pointers from others.<br />
<br />
On that note, I've run into TONS of people lately in random LFG that have outright began to rage and drop group because someone dared try to help them not suck. Lots of Paladin tanks that refuse to use Righteous Fury, DKs DPSing in Blood Presence still.... getting all pissy when you try to point out a mistake they're making.<br />
<br />
Those people will hopefully 'drown' in Cataclysm. Or they'll just reroll to Arcane Mages. Either or.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The official [old] WoW forums are now read-only, yet Blizzard links heavily to these old forums from all their sites. Even the Battle.Net site links to the read-only old forums if you click on the &quot;Forums&quot; link. You have to click on the &quot;Enter the new Community Site&quot; button on the Battle.Net site and -THEN- click on the forums link. It is a navigational snafu of epic proportions.<br />
<br />
Also, the new official forum UI just feels less-than-optimal and isn't as clean and efficient as their old forums or especially MMO Champion forums.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's forum migration blunder is MMO Champion's gain.</div></div><hr />

It sounds like we're going back to a TBC playstyle, which I welcome with open arms. I've been itching to use traps on my hunter again, and maybe I'll have a use for my enslave demon and banish demon abilities on my warlock again ... not sure if I want to seduce mobs with the succubus, though.<br />

just so you're aware, arcane won't be as faceroll as you suggest in cataclysm, even for caster dps, mana is going to be a very finite resource, and arcane mages will need to learn how to balance the damage output as well as mana conservation, and it's kinda ignorant to suggest mages will still be as overpowered as you make them out to be.<br />

After that it will just be a tool for teleporting your guild (and/or friends on server) group to the instance. It will be more fun to weather the storm of content wrecking the other people in your group and just quest your way to 85 and only stick with people on your realm to do 5s than waste 30-60m extra per run teaching people stuff they can learn from googling on their own.</div></div><hr />

It may be just me, but I don't want 'scare factor' in a Paladin set anyway!<br />

We're shining defenders of the Light and of Justice, not raging Barbarians (Warriors) or demonic spellcasters (Warlocks).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard's forum migration blunder is MMO Champion's gain.<br />
<br />
This is a matter of opinion. I find the new forums nicer to use, so I'm not sure you can use your opinion as concrete fact.<br />
<br />
I found the old forums pretty dull looking, I like the new avatars, I'll get used to them over time but they feel less clunky and look less bad. They are also a better contrast between text and background.<br />
<br />
I think the influx of traffic might be to do with the lull before expansions versus the new expansion getting ready to ship. I took a long break during the summer, both from WoW and from MMO-Champ, and I came back OK for Cataclysm. I know the official forums are an intellectual cesspit at the best of times, but they have improved the layout (unlike some other companies who really did break their forums in an attempt to upgrade them).</div></div><hr />

Especially with the merging of the two general topic forums. <br />
<br />
Perhaps an Alliance and Horde general discussion sub-forum, where faction specific things can be discussed and help limit the alliance/horde back and forth that so many threads get mired in. <br />
<br />
I think no matter what happens the new mods REALLY need to be on the ball with locking pointless threads, moving topics to their correct forum and keeping things as clean as possible. With the thousands of topics that are going to be created in the next few weeks, order will have to be maintained.<br />
<br />
I've been frustrated quite a bit by some of the garbage people post that ends up going on for 10-20 pages without any intervention. When a thread devolves into bickering it should be locked since there isn't anything else that's going to be gained from it.</div></div><hr />

I love LFG, but at this point I think it's insufficiently &quot;WoWish&quot; to qualify. The first few months made it look like it was going to be yet another WoW inspired comic, but it's branched off into a story line so complex and so different from WoW that the only real commonality is the look of the characters. It's a great comic, don't get me wrong, in a lot of ways it's a better comic for *not* being yet another WoW strip, but it's really not a WoW strip anymore.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, if you removed the lore from general, then youd just have &quot;garrosh vs. zul'jin&quot; type threads. It would make it rather empty.</div></div><hr />

We have a lot of anime-related talk (even manga-related talk!) in the TV forum, and a book forum is definitely under consideration. For now, you're welcome to post book-related discussion in the TV forum also, if you'd like :)</div></div><hr />

People are undoubtedly going to whine and complain because the rules right now aren't being enforced as strictly as they should be just because there are SO many users and so few mods.<br />
<br />
What happened last time (and I was around for it) was moderators actually started banning people and people were like &quot;WAT!?! THSI SITE WARNS/BANS FOR IMAGE SPAM?! SO LAME. I NEVER READ THE RULES BUT THAT IS THEIR FAULT QQQQQQQQ&quot;.</div></div><hr />
