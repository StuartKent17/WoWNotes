Cataclysm Hotfixes - Updated Dec. 16<br />
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br />

<br />
It is no longer possible to waste a Soulstone by attempting to use it on a dead target. The player will receive an Invalid Target error message at the completion of their channel.

Cataclysm 10-Day Trial Edition Now Available<br />
If you or a friend are currently playing Wrath of the Lich King and haven’t yet experienced the content Cataclysm has to offer, you can sign up now (http://us.battle.net/en/info/cataclysm-trial) to play a 10-day free trial version of this latest expansion for World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
During your free trial, you'll undertake epic new quests, explore the reshaped and newly discovered lands of Azeroth, and see the world from a whole new perspective as one of the shape-changing worgen or crafty goblins.<br />
<br />
To participate, you’ll need full versions of World of Warcraft and the first two expansions, The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King. Note that a character of at least level 78 is required to explore the new, high-level zones. More information on the 10-day free trial is available in our FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article/wowcatatrialfaq). We look forward to seeing you in the new Azeroth!<br />

In-progress dungeons<br />
If you choose specific dungeons instead of the Random Dungeon option, you should never get an in-progress dungeon. We understand you may be looking for a specific dungeon boss because of a loot drop, achievement, etc., so it may be in your best interest to queue for that particular dungeon if this is the case.<br />
<br />
We don't want to make it too easy for players to skip over in-progress dungeons. What would happen is a Dungeon Finder group would virtually always be abandoned as soon as anyone leaves the group.<br />
<br />
Also, I think right now you're seeing more in-progress dungeons pop because, in general, the dungeons are more challenging now than they were when the Looking For Dungeon feature was first introduced in Wrath of the Lich King. Some players may get frustrated and bail at the first sign of trouble, instead of realizing that everyone may have to work a little harder than they're used to in order to conquer a dungeon.

Actually its Blizzard intent to promote raiding in such groups, as they removed distinction from all their trackers (namely Armory). <br />
Killing something in 10 or 25 should be now play style choice, not a meassurement to skill.<br />
<br />
Also, for first video there seems to be a problem (&quot;user removed this video&quot; for me)</div></div><hr />

I don't think its overloaded. There has been some problems with the armory since blizzard changed to the new one. The problem seems to be mainly with the EU armory tho.<br />

As a guess they nerfed it. Those were particularly difficult add packs without a lot of CC. Not impossible, but fairly difficult. We wiped on them a couple times in a Random that was overall quite good and cleared the rest of the instance with minimal wipes, we just had limited CC. <br />
<br />
On a side note I'm surprised none of resident conspiracy theorists have jumped in yet to declaim the horror of MMO-Champ advertising a new Curse service on the front page.

<br />
You keep telling yourself that. There is no individual skill difference between 10-man and 25-man raids. The only real difference is that there are higher odds of mouth-breathers in a 25-man raid and you have to manage them. Hell, the joke back during the days of 40-man raiding is that it took just as long to form and setup the raid as it does to actually work on the content.<br />
<br />
In simpler terms, 25-man raids are only harder in the sense that you have more people to manage and more points of failure.<br />
<br />
Personally, I've retired from 25-man raiding and prefer to do 10-man raiding with a smaller group of like-minded, fun people and there is a lot less drama and issues because usually everybody is on the same page.<br />
<br />
In the end, WoW is a social game. Some people might prefer running with bigger packs while others might prefer smaller cliques.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds simple enough. 25 has 15 more people and even if one of them fails at boss tactics, it's often a wipe for the entire group. So more players, more chances of failing. And usually some people have crap dps and those aren't chosen for 10 mans</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? Pact of Darkness can be interrupted (at least on normal, don't know about heroics). Absolutely no normal mode 5man needs any CC anyway...</div></div><hr />

There is no individual skill difference between 10-man and 25-man raids. The only real difference is that there are higher odds of mouth-breathers in a 25-man raid and you have to manage them. Hell, the joke back during the days of 40-man raiding is that it took just as long to form and setup the raid as it does to actually work on the content.<br />
<br />
In simpler terms, 25-man raids are only harder in the sense that you have more people to manage and more points of failure.<br />
<br />
Personally, I've retired from 25-man raiding and prefer to do 10-man raiding with a smaller group of like-minded, fun people and there is a lot less drama and issues because usually everybody is on the same page.<br />
<br />
In the end, WoW is a social game. Some people might prefer running with bigger packs while others might prefer smaller cliques.<br />
You can go ahead and keep believing that because Blizzard tells you to. I SERIOUSLY doubt that 10 and 25 man can ever be tuned to the exact same difficulty. I like that they share loot because I really don't have time/the desire/patience to deal with 24 other people making stupid mistakes, but I don't delude myself into thinking that they actually are the same difficulty. 25 mans are what competitive raiding guilds should be doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tell me with a straight face that 10m LK was as difficult as 25m. You can't, because it isn't true. Many portions of the fight were basically not an issue with less people.<br />
<br />
The entire challenge of raids is trying to get people to minimize points of failure. Boss mechanics take maybe 5 minutes to learn and execute. But to get everyone to do their task IS the challenge. So, naturally, more people = harder to do said task without someone screwing up. Then there are situations like 25m LK, where the mechanics of the fight are different when you're in the 25m version. Valkryies are pathetic in 10m, as there's one single target. No need to group up at all which can be tough when you're doing it near a defile timer. That part of the fight is not challenging anymore, and it makes the two versions completely different.<br />
<br />

People continue to say that the smaller raid group is the better raid group. Eventually we'll end up with 3 player raids. EXCITING.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It can be interrupted on Heroic too, but the first pull in the instance has two of those guys, plus one of the fire throwers (who cast WAY more often than the cool down on any class' interrupts). You can only interrupt so many things, and there are a lot of things to interrupt. Like I said it's not impossible, but it's quite challenging. Pact of Darkness ticks for 20K-25K AOE on Heroic, the fireballs hit for around 20K-25K (and even with all interrupts on that guy he's going to get some fireballs off, let alone assigning two people to the Darkcasters). At least a tick of Pact is going to get off no matter how quick you are... Anyway, we got it, but it took several tries to get all the pieces in place, so I rather doubt they buffed it.</div></div><hr />

More hands to &quot;share the load&quot;. &quot;Real men&quot;, as someone so eloquently put it, are not 25-man raiders, as if the size of your raid determines your value as a person. (Yeah, you forgot about the women.) The simple fact is, that you raid whatever the f*** you like to raid, whichever is more fun for you. Neither one is &quot;better&quot; or &quot;more challenging&quot;. From my personal experience, the only challenges to 25-man raiding are filling the spots with competent, like-minded players that you don't need to hold hands with and carry through the content. Oh, and staying connected and running on a slow machine are pretty annoying hurdles. 10-mans are more friendly, more close-knit, and everyone HAS to pull their weight. From what I've experienced, there's little to no drama over loot, and it's easier to find mistakes and correct them. Wiping on 10-man is fun. Wiping on 25-man is a headache. Just my two copper, take it or leave it as you will.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, because being the second best guild in the world is a failure. Wonder where you were ranked?<br />

Apart from that, if you consider 10 man raiding a lolol business, funny how most guilds in the top 10 ranked are 25 man guilds...in fact the pretty even mix of 10 and 25 man guilds seem to suggest that tuning both raidsizes as similar as possible is working....<br />

That is the spirit. We need more argumentations like that (also know as polemic). Indeed, 25 mans are not 10 mans because ....doh..they need 15 men more. That is not fanboism, that is basic maths.<br />

Badly designed if you asked me. I got to character selection, typed my char's name (and misstyped one char) and now i am stucked at 5 tries to confirm its really not my character, and after i failed all i got was i can try again in 3 hours :D<br />

First you can not deny there are more people in 25 mans than there are in 10. Now do things hit harder in 25 man vs 10 man? Yes. There are more aoes, more things for healers to keep track of, more things for everyone in the raid to keep track of. If you have a stackingdot, with an aoe component in 10 man it's easy to spread out. In 25 man it's harder. It's a bit harder to see certain markers for bosses in 25 mans. <br />
<br />
You may not like it, but 25 mans are harder. Saying it isn't just shows you for the wrath baby you are.</div></div><hr />
