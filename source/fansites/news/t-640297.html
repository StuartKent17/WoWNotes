quote bye Boubouille:<br />
The PTR testing schedule has been updated. The Flame Leviathan encounter was heavily bugged when it was tested on PTR yesterday and it wouldn't be surprising to see a new build deployed on PTRs tonight or early tomorrow to fix the issues before the testing.<br />
<br />

I just want Weapon Mastery and Improved Intercept to switch places back to their current live positions again. :'(<br />
<br />
Seriously, why is it that Fury is going to have a talent that shortens Intercept's cooldown and one that resets it completely in the same tree???</div></div><hr />

<br />
Intercept is fury ability, always was. Fury talent tree is original place for that talent. And is a buff for fury pvp. I was waiting for giving weapon mastery back to arms for a looong time. Was stupid move from blizz removing it from arms. He need that talent for reduce disarm, really need. Even when stupid retri with retarded judgement crits got disarming reduction arms was still without it. Never understood that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Arms is getting Juggernaut, Prot has Warbringer, Fury should have one called &quot;Juggernaut Bitch&quot;, where Intercept has a 10 sec CD with an additional talent to increase stun by .2 and lower CD by .4 for 5 points<br />
<br />
I just want something other then Armour Pen in Battle Stance... something Useful like an extra button to push</div></div><hr />
