Homogenization and healing<br />
Homogenization is a risk. Totally. It's something we try and fight against. In the case of healing, we don't want to erode the unique aspects of the 5 talent specs. We just want to move the non-unique parts closer together. If you need an analogy, we're not going to mess with the flowers or the fruit or the shape of the leaves. We just want everyone to have similar roots. Spells like Circle, Chain Heal and Beacon will continue to be an important and unique part of your repertoire. We just want to make sure everyone has the basic tools so that they aren't in a situation where they're trying to tighten screws with a hammer.<br />
<br />
Now having said that, there are a couple of exceptions. If you are a Disc priest who loved to use PW:S and nothing else or a Resto druid who loved to use Rejuv and nothing else, then you will probably need to use more of your buttons again. We don't want to promote the strategy of trying to pre-heal as many people as possible without really worrying about who is actually taking damage. There's not a lot of decision-making or coordination or reactive gameplay there. Disc priests will need to actually cast heals (and Penance can certainly be one of them) and druids will have to mix in some direct heals along with their hots. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25026435563/where-s-blizzard-heading/))<br />
<br />
Healing in Cataclysm<br />
I take a different view on a couple of your points here. Healers won't be forced to spam their most efficient heal because the encounters will be less threatening early on. Later on when your mana regen as at its highest you will need to use your highest throughput spell because the damage is higher. You'll also need to use your fast heal sometimes for the same reason. Fortunately fully raid buffed and in good gear, you'll have more mana regen. I don't think any of these changes encourage players to blame healers more. Bad players are always going to deflect their failures onto someone else. That is why they are bad players. The alternative is to make healing so simplistic that there is almost no chance of failure (i.e. nobody would ever die). You'd never get blamed for anything but you'd probably also be pretty bored.<br />
<br />
Minus gaming coefficients, we pretty much had this model with downranking and it largely worked. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25026435563/where-s-blizzard-heading/))<br />

&quot;Widening the spell selection&quot;<br />
The definition of &quot;widening spell selection&quot; has to be real choices. Just putting more heals in your spellbook doesn't accomplish much. They have to be spells you'd realistically consider casting, and not just once an evening. That is most challenging with the druid because we decided not to cut any current heals.

Retribution in Cataclysm<br />
The current plan is for Crusader Strike to be baseline, but for Ret to have talents that add to it, and for Divine Storm to be the 51-point talent. <br />
<br />
[...] Keep in mind that the way Retribution works, you aren't often choosing to exclude one attack in exchange for another. A Fury warrior can just not use Whirlwind and spend the rage on Heroic Strike again. But Rets are not limited by mana as much as cooldowns. You can choose to not do anything when Crusader Strike et al. are on cooldown, or you can use Divine Storm.<br />
<br />
I agree it would, and perhaps does, feel crappy to get the same ability that another class gets as a base ability for your 51-point talent. That's not the design goal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25026405663/will-divine-storm-remain-the-51-point-talent/))</div></div><hr />

I think what they referred in the post was about healers currently pre-hoting people without thinking, they want you to think who you are healing. Of course the best healers would be the ones doing pre-emptive healing based on what they know will happen rather then reactive healing. This will always be a difference between great players and average ones no matter what system you have.<br />
Sure at the start of the expansion, at simpler raids reactive healing will work, but I'm sure at end-game raids fast reactions will also count.</div></div><hr />

And some tool said how the graphics leave much to be desired for 2010. You have to bear in mind the world is much larger than most games you will play.

To be honest it's probably just because of the mass amount of leaked Catagasm Alpha screenies we've seen already. There's basically no point in giving us daily screenshots anymore if they're just pictures of fucking trees.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't change the fact that making Divine Storm into a copy of Whirlwind (again) is detrimental to the spell as a whole, which hurts due to it being a talent. This is one of the many reasons people didn't spec into Command when baselines spells (Blood/Matyr, Vengeance/Corruption, Rightenouss, Everything else).<br />
<br />
But hey, doing something like making the spell baseline in it's soon-to-be-AoE form and giving Rets something else to do dps with is just far too hard.<br />

Agreed at this point. Enhancement Shammies have been dual wielding for so long they've official outgrown any other older means of deeps.

And some tool said how the graphics leave much to be desired for 2010. You have to bear in mind the world is much larger than most games you will play. Do you have any idea how much lag there would be if they increased the graphics too much? Or how long loading screens would take? Of course not, you probably live on CoD.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't know what you're talking about. All the graphics are on the client side, better graphics doesn't slow load times. What slows load times is blizzard's servers. On PTR load times are way faster than live. Blizzard is so far behind graphics its pathetic. The only lag it would cause is FPS lag which has nothing to do with load times or servers. WoW uses streaming 3D meaning that the whole world is not loaded, what is loaded is just what you can see on your screen, this is how the world is seamless with no load screens between zones.<br />
<br />
If your FPS is too low just turn down the settings, simple. Nothing to worry about.</div></div><hr />

That could be any jungley place, my first thought was STV. i was hoping for more creatures, and shots of the destruction, maybe some of the new places in the old world, and the occasional shot of new zones. But the new zones is all we're getting. And it's like &quot;Oh, a wall! Must SS that!&quot; &quot;Oh, this wall! We must SSotD it!&quot; &quot;YES!&quot; and poof. We have a wall. -_-;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orinosuke</div><div class="date">2010-05-26, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The screen shot looks fairly nice. I say fairly because the game really badly needs a bloom/lighting update. The lighting seems almost more outdated than even most Wii games. Galaxy 2 has some real impressive lighting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Funnily enough, I always considered lighting to be one of the few strengths of the Wii graphics engine Enough so to the point where they, when used properly, masked the jaggies in most Wii games. It made the graphics look a lot better than they otherwise would have. (Though, the only games I've really seen do this are Nintendo-published games.)<br />
<br />
At any rate, I like the screenshot. It's not necessarily exciting in an obvious sense, but it really has me looking forward to the explorative atmosphere of the zone.</div></div><hr />

I'm almost certain they did this to prevent Elemental and Resto shaman from dual-wielding caster weapons, but is there a reason why making all caster weapons Mainhand-only wouldn't be the smarter option?</div></div><hr />

Theyare trying to make cata fun for healers again - 'predictive healing' is anything but fun. Going into a fight knowing I only have two concentrate on certain peopple carrying certain responsibilities on a fight is dull.<br />

I love when raid raid members suddenly get smashed for tons of health makes me have to be on my toes and react quick therefore making the encounter more fun.<br />

<br />
Looking at bars go down and then reacting as quickly as possible to get them up is not a very smart gameplay either. Always hotting same people knowing that is exactly what is going to happens isn't either. <br />
<br />
Knowing something bad is going to happen to a certain area, or knowing take is going to take a few big hits in the next amount of time so you organize your mana and healing burst for that exact time while reacting at other stuff is nice and challenging healing.</div></div><hr />
