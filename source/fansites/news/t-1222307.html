The only Caribbean country to really get hit by Sandy was Haiti. Cuba the Dominican Republic and Bahama's suffered some damage, but noting incredibly serious. And I don't mean to trash Haiti, but over the last 2 year they have received a MOUNTAIN of aid from the international community (including the US). Also,the damage estimates and death toll in the US far out pace all of damage and death caused in the Caribbean combined (Yes, I did pull that from Wikipedia, don't shoot me). <br />
<br />
Bottom line, the US was by far hit the hardest. I'm not saying other countries don't need help, I'm really not. But to insinuate that the US doesn't deserve a slice of that pie is just plain wrong.</div></div><hr />

Your support will enable the Red Cross to provide shelter, food, emotional support, and other assistance to survivors of disasters like Superstorm Sandy<br />
<br />
He said &quot;like Sandy&quot;. It was an EXAMPLE. When the money starts to flow from that pet it'll be too late to help the sandy vics anyway. <br />
<br />
But nowhere does it state that the money is reserved for USA only. Seems to me like they give it to the RC to do with as they deem necessary.</div></div><hr />

Once again, the only country that got hit hard was Haiti, and there is already a huge amount of money that has been rolling into that country from the the earthquake 2 years ago. Something along the line of 2 billion dollars of international aid have been put into it.<br />
<br />
Once again, I'm not saying Haiti doesn't need help, I am saying that relief structures and money are already in place for it.</div></div><hr />

While I do not agree with the general America hate, you do start a lot of wars. Most recently: Afghanistan and Iraq. They were just ... unnecessary. This whole &quot;war on terror&quot; is just political BS to be able to go to war, for whatever reasons.<br />
<br />

<br />
Have someone in your guild or a close friend buy it for you and gift it too you....then you just pay back your friend with real money.<br />

Wish there was a mount to match the Kitty....that would be even more awesome.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
They could have donated nothing at all, would that have made you happy? I mean, clearly 0% is much better than 50%.<br />
<br />
People are so jaded these days. Why is it a bad thing for a corporation to make money? Blizzard/Activision isn't running a charity, they are running a business. Stop being mad for them wanting to make a buck. Hell you pay them a monthly fee to play WoW, you paid them to buy WoW and every expansion. Don't be mad at them on one hand for wanting to make a buck and love them on the other hand enough to continually pay them each month to play their game.<br />

I will be getting one of these fine firey felines. I'm a ginger, so it has a special place in my heart. Oh, and i love cats. I don't own any cause i'm a little on the allergic side and live in an apartment where it would cost too much for me to own one, but i love the little guys!</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry? Where on earth do you get your economic information from? Greece is in a depression and is close to being a failed state. America has 3.5% GDP growth, dropping unemployment, and a government able to enforce its laws. So again, how is America anything at all like Greece?<br />

While I do not agree with the general America hate, you do start a lot of wars. Most recently: Afghanistan and Iraq. They were just ... unnecessary. This whole &quot;war on terror&quot; is just political BS to be able to go to war, for whatever reasons.<br />
<br />
Every logical thinking human being knows that you cannot defeat a loosely structured organization with independently operating cells through conventional warfare. It's just not possible.<br />
<br />
Umm...other than the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, I challenge you to name a war STARTED by the United States.</div></div><hr />

Face it, your country is broke. Also the spread of wealth in the US slowly starts to slide down to 3th world proportions. So expect living conditions to drop and crime flourish even more than it is doing now.<br />
Also the reason the US goes to war a lot also has it's ties with the arms industry being the biggest industry in the US. Also the second biggest industry is very illustrative: the trash industry. Considering everything has to be big in the US that doesn't surprise me though. The US is adapting very poorly to the future TBH and it will hit the hardest when resources run out as you are running a 'waste' economy.</div></div><hr />

Wrong. They have the ultimate tool : the USD printing press. As long as they have the dollars making machine , and the other people on the planet still use and accept dollars, they are not broke and won't ever be .</div></div><hr />

As a Serb, I wouldn't dare call a NATO bombing of Belgrade a &quot;war&quot;, neither would I call a singular invasion a &quot;war&quot;. War is a state of usually open and declared armed hostile conflict between states or nations. NATO is not a state, and Panama never fought back, ergo neither instance you linked are wars. Seriously, it looks like people just want to shit on the US for whatever. Let's not forget that the British have invaded 90% of the world, with only 22 countries through history escaping their wrath. Why not call the British out on their aggression?<br />

I find it funny that your own link (http://www.usdebtclock.org/world-debt-clock.html) counters your awful point. Compare the debt levels of the US and Greece, then try your argument again. Or is 73% somehow equal to 189% and 100% is equal to 234%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pathetic Blizzard, a slap in the face on those poor people who already had it rough to start with before hurricane Sandy, like on Haiti<br />
<br />
You do realize that the US as a whole donated something like 800million dollars to the relief efforts in Haiti right? Your belief that everyone in the US is rich and well taken care of is a joke and the belief of either a) a child or b) an ignorant adult.</div></div><hr />

Printing more money just lowers the value of said money and if you keep doing that dollars won't be accepted anymore. Money needs to be backed up by something of value, otherwise the paper it's printed on is worth more than the money itself. Just printing more is a downward spiral if you don't have economic growth to back it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll just send my money where they need it.<br />
<br />
Let's say you got your wish. Defense is slashed in half, US bases cannot be supported and are withdrawn. What now? Who steps up to the plate? The UN? Fat chance, a coalition of countries with no militaries more interested in themselves than the good of the whole. The only other country to match the US in army is Russia, so that's out. Not to mention what happens to places like S. Korea, Afghanistan, etc. when peacekeeping forces leave in the interim before another superpower steps up. What if we never intervened against Saddam? What would happen had his intended capture of Kuwait's oil reserves happened? What happens to all those smaller countries all over the world with inadequate police forces that welcome the protection offered? It's not as simple as picking and choosing who to help, and letting those countries burn is not an option, we're far more civilized than that.</div></div><hr />

Dude, the natural disaster was in the USA. We already give money to other countries that are in need. My gosh. People want handouts all over the damn place...<br />
<br />
Euhm, you want handouts yourself mate.... thats one great example of irony.<br />
<br />
And you are one misinformed person amongst millions, due to the lack of media attention, wich was more focussed on the US then on the rest of countries hit:<br />
http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/29/caribbean-nations-hurricane-sandy<br />
69 people dead in 6 countries. In Haiti alone 52 people dead, and hundreds of thousands are left homeless.<br />
<br />
Now I do feel for those hit in the US, but I never forget the fact that those people hit in the US even now have it better then the people living on the Caribbean islands wich get hit by hurricanes more often.<br />
<br />
The severity of the impact on the people in the two regions isn't comparable at all. Its like comparing a drought in Africa to a drought in western countries. The fomer costs thousands of lives, the latter increases the local food prices at most. <br />
<br />
And with the US as an economy being so big, that economy makes relief efforts cheap and might even lead to an increase in spendings wich in terms causes more jobs. On Haiti the people who didn't already live in tents, (still after the 2010 quake) will have to do so now, and might have to do so for the coming year(s).<br />
<br />
However to keep things on topic, I do like the idea, and will buy the pet. Its atleast something I can do to help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you know what? <br />
<br />
In current &quot;high tech&quot; society and civilization money is based on the basic principle of existence itself! On the exactly the same law/rule as all living beings! <br />
<br />
&quot;I am that I am and I am the 'law' &quot;<br />
<br />
Money is nothing else than a state's (national/country) law that declares &quot;money&quot; as the only legal tender in the economy of the corresponding area/territory.<br />
<br />
But their is one big, prime problem which such a thing, &quot;fiat&quot; money. Its value is based on pure speculation and hazard of &quot;high banking&quot;, which operate beyond the scope of goods exchange and on &quot;vampire&quot; principle of usury. <br />
<br />
IT IS THAT THING WHICH NEEDS TO CHANGE, NOT SAVING AND HIGHER TAXES! <br />
<br />
With higher taxes and saving we are only prolonging &quot;status quo&quot; (current state of only increasing debt but at slower pace) to the total collapse and destruction of human civilization. Unless those who &quot;run the show&quot; decide to trigger another world war for total economy reset.<br />
