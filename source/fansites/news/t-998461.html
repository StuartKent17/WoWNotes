PTR Raid Testing Schedule - Oct 14<br />
Super short notice but it looks like we'll get to see the Dragon Soul raid today!! Post stream links and screenshots in comments!<br />
<br />
And so it begins...<br />
<br />
Today we're going to try and test a couple of the initial bosses in Dragon Soul.<br />
<br />
14:30 PDT - Morchok (10 Player)<br />
16:30 PDT - Yor'sahj the Unsleeping (10 Player)<br />
<br />
There will be additional testing scheduled in the upcoming weeks, both in the morning and afternoon.<br />
<br />
As always, the scheduling for PTR testing will be VERY fluid. Tests can be announced, canceled, or rescheduled at a moment's notice depending on build and server status, outstanding bugs, etc. I will try to give as much advance notice about tests, but that is not always possible. Also note that these encounters are all works in progress. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Morchok<br />
<br />
Morchok<br />
The most powerful elemental still under Deathwing's sway, Morchok-once a passive guardian-is now convinced that his only respite will come with Azeroth's demise. Morchok rages against the foundation of Wyrmrest Temple, Azeroth's last beacon of hope in the Hour of Twilight.<br />
<br />
Stomp<br />
Morchok performs a massive stomp, splitting 750000 damage between all players within 30 yards. The two closest targets take a double share of the damage. In Heroic Difficulty Stomp also increases the Physical damage taken by affected players by 50% for 20 sec.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/tank.png&quot; /&gt; Crush Armor<br />
Morchok strikes his current target, inflicting 120% normal melee damage and reducing the target's armor by 10% for 20 sec. This effect stacks up to 10 times.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/deadly.png&quot; /&gt; Resonating Crystal<br />
Morchok conjures an explosive crystal onto the battlefield that explodes after 12 sec. for massive Shadow damage. The explosion splits the damage between the three closest enemies, and the total damage inflicted increases depending on the distance of each player from the crystal. In 25 Player raids, the damage splits between the five closest enemies.<br />
<br />
Furious<br />
At 20% remaining health, Morchok becomes furious and increases his attack speed by 50% and his damage inflicted by 20%.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/important.png&quot; /&gt; The Earth Consumes You!<br />
Morchok uses the power of the earth to draw all players to him, inflicting 50% of their total health as Physical damage. While the power of the earth draws the players to him, Morchok also summons Earth's Vengeance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Earth's Vengeance ('http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/103178/earths-vengeance/') - Shards of Earth's Vengeance erupt from the ground, inflicting 15000 Physical damage to nearby players within 2 yards and leaving behind obstacles.<br />
Black Blood of the Earth ('http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/103785/black-blood-of-the-earth/') - Morchok causes the Black Blood the Earth to erupt outwards from him, inflicting 5000 Nature damage and increasing Nature damage taken by 100% every sec. while a player stands within the blood. This effect stacks up to 20 times.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/heroic.png&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/important.png&quot; /&gt; Even Morchok<br />
Upon reaching 90% health, Morchok tears himself in half, creating his twin, Even Morchok. His twin will do the same spells Morchok performs, a few seconds later.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yor'sahj the Unsleeping<br />
<br />
Yor'sahj the Unsleeping<br />
Since the fall of the Bastion of Twilight, Yor'sahj the Unsleeping has eagerly assisted Deathwing, providing the Destroyer with the means to release more faceless ones from their prisons deep beneath the earth. Their numbers are endless and their power is beyond reckoning, and Yor'sahj intends to reap a grim reward for his faithful service.<br />
<br />
Void Bolt<br />
Soulflayer Yor'sahj blasts his primary target with dark energy, dealing 90000 Shadow damage and reducing the amount of healing they take by 10%.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/important.png&quot; /&gt; Call Blood of Shu'ma<br />
Soulflayer Yor'sahj calls to the might of Shu'mas, summoning three differently colored globules of his blood. These globules path slowly towards Yor'sahj, infusing him with additional powers if they reach him. In Heroic difficulty four slimes answer Yor'sahj's call.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fusing Vapors ('http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/103635/fusing-vapors/') - The blood globules emit a vapor that fuses with all other nearby globules when attacked. The vapor heals the nearby globules for 5% of their maximum life.<br />
<br />
When one globule dies, the surviving globules completely fuse and gain immunity to all forms of damage.<br />
Glowing Globule - When a Glowing Globule reaches Yor'sahj, it infuses Yor'sahj with the Glowing Blood of the Shu'ma.<br />
<br />
Glowing Blood of Shu'ma ('http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/104901/glowing-blood-of-shuma/') - Yor'sahj's Void Bolt now hits all nearby targets instead of one, Yor'sahj uses his abilities twice as often, and his attack speed increases by 50%.<br />
<br />
Cobalt Globule - When a Cobalt Globule reaches Yor'sahj, it infuses Yor'sahj with the ability to summon Mana Voids.<br />
<br />
Mana Void ('http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/105539/mana-void/') - A Mana Void leeches all the mana from every ranged spell caster and healer, storing the mana within itself. Destroying the Mana Void evenly returns the total of the leeched mana via Mana Diffusion to players within 18 yards.<br />
<br />
Crimson Globule - When a Crimson Globule reaches Yor'sahj, it infuses Yor'sahj with the Searing Blood ability.<br />
<br />
Searing Blood ('http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/108363/searing-blood/') - Yor'sahj sears the blood of three random players, inflicting a base of 35000 Fire damage. The further the target stands from Yor'sahj, the greater shock received from the blast. In 25 player raids, Yor'sahj sears the blood of eight random players.<br />
<br />
Dark Globule - When a Dark Globule reaches Yor'sahj, the corruption of the blood seeps out into the Mouth of Shu'ma. This vile corruption then periodically creates Forgotten Ones that attack the players.<br />
<br />
Forgotten One - These creatures fixate on a random target.<br />
<br />
Psychic Slice ('http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/108355/psychic-slice/') - The Forgotten One emits a wave of psychic force at its current target, inflicting 44000 Shadow damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Acidic Globule - When an Acidic Globule reaches Yor'sahj, the mouth of Shu'ma infuses with the acidic blood and stimulates further Digestive Acid production.<br />
<br />
Digestive Acid ('http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/105573/digestive-acid/') - Digestive Acid periodically secretes from the stomach lining, inflicting 60000 Nature damage to a player and nearby allies within 4 yards.<br />
<br />
Shadowed Globule - When a Shadowed Globule reaches Yor'sahj, it infuses Yor'sahj with the Deep Corruption ability.<br />
<br />
Deep Corruption ('http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/105173/deep-corruption/') - Yor'sahj's Deep Corruption spreads to every player, causing every fifth healing or absorbtion effect cast on a player to trigger a violent detonation, inflicting 50000 Shadow damage to all players.</div></div><hr />

I think it's supposed to be a pun. He splits into two bosses so there's even more &quot;chok&quot; to fight.<br />
<br />
No idea what chok is supposed to mean...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also can't help but think that the raid content I've seen so far is pretty dull. I mean sure, lore-wise it makes total sense to have the battles in Drtagonblight and AQ etc, but it &quot;feels&quot; like I'm watching a wotlk world boss fight in Dragonblight.</div></div><hr />

I'd sure pick up those days again rather than hardcore raiding encounters you already know everything about. <br />
The only part of Vanilla raiding that sucked was the cockblocking four horsemen / ouro / cthun and their very generous tuesday hotfix for Nihilum only.<br />
<br />
+ Im not saying they shouldnt test it. Im just saying that they shouldnt have it on public testing. Is it really that hard to test for themselfs? Or invite guilds and pay them for testing new content while signing an NDA.</div></div><hr />

If I didn't knew better I'd say they're putting as much resources as possible into the next expansion. It's still a reasonable assumption though, looking at the serious competition that's on the way, and the decline in subs. The next one needs to be a massive killer, otherwise WoW is going down the drain. It's not like that it will die, it's more like a fading away. And with it comes the downfall in terms of the money producing machine it got to be. There needs to be a big, fat BOOOM that lasts beyond Blizzcon and hype, beyond the initial release, otherwise the competition may have the potential to eat away serious amounts of customers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm assuming that its Present time still, but seeing as how 2 of the 5mans are in the past it is much easier to have Hour of Twilight and Dragon Soul enter from the same place (I also cant think of anywhere else can you put a entrance to a raid/5man that takes place in an entire zone, I for one wouldn't like to find an obscure portal at one of the Dragon Shires)</div></div><hr />

The whole storyline begins in the 5 mans, and ends with the raid. In End Time you go to the future, then in the Hour of Twilight to the present, from there to the Well of Eternity in the past, and finally Back to the Present (sadly without any kind of De Lorean), where the raid called Dragon Soul will happen. <br />
<br />
So it makes complete sense to have it in the Caverns of Time, because it's one hell of a time travel ride.</div></div><hr />

As long as the boss challenge is fair and not just assuming that people will be okay with unfairness, then yeah, go for it. It would give players a sense of having to pick priority, because most if not all healers are casters (why I say it has to stay fair: don't have the voids fuck up all mana for all healers and then have him hit like a damn truck right afterwards while making that particular globule too fast for anyone to reasonably take down). <br />
<br />
Does sound like to me you don't like casters. No reason to make the fight unfair against them. Yes, give them a danger that they will have to develop a strategy for, but don't make things impossible for anyone to deal with because of a personal grudge (and yes, I too think mages have become severely OPed now at the expense of other classes getting constantly nerfed for no reason).</div></div><hr />

Well, based on the video, Yor'sahj himself doesn't really seem to hit all that hard (I mean obviously not, right, because otherwise he'd destroy the raid if you ever got blue+yellow), so most healing will be based on whatever largely-avoidable AoE damage is going out at the time. Mana Void will probably end up actually helping healers because they have generally lower regen than DPS casters and thus an equal share of mana will almost always end up taking from DPS and giving to healers.<br />
<br />
As for me, I don't necessarily dislike caster classes, but I do dislike Blizzard's design philosophy for this expansion, which is alternating between the fight that favors ranged, the fight that sucks for melee, the fight where multi-dotting is king, the fight where ranged get a ridiculous damage buff, the fight where weak adds untouchable by melee let ranged pad meters with AoE, etc etc. It's dull and this dumb attack power boost doesn't change anything because the problem exists in the boss mechanics. Hey, maybe they should get rid of glancing blows too, that might help. Ugh.</div></div><hr />
