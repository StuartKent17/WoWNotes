World of Warcraft in Russian<br />
I don't think it's a big surprise for the readers of this site, we announced it last week. Anyway Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today announced that World of Warcraft is to be fully localized in Russian for release in 2008. The Russian version will be the fifth officially supported European language, complementing the existing English, French, German and Spanish versions.<br />
PARIS, France -- Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today announced that World of Warcraft®, its award-winning, subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game, is to be fully localised in Russian for release in 2008. The Russian version will be the fifth officially supported European language, complementing the existing English, French, German and Spanish versions.<br />
<br />
A dedicated Russian-speaking team is currently being assembled at the Blizzard Europe offices in France and Ireland to ensure Russian World of Warcraft players will benefit from the same quality of 24/7 native-language support as other European players. Roles will include in-game support, offline technical and customer support, localisation and quality assurance, community relations, and creation and maintenance of a new official Russian World of Warcraft website.<br />
<br />
&quot;Considering the scale and enthusiasm of the Russian community, we recognized that offering a dedicated Russian-language version of World of Warcraft was the next important step for the game in Europe,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, president and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;We’re looking forward to providing an even more accessible gameplay experience to current and future players.&quot;<br />
<br />
Further details on language pack downloads and migration plans for existing Russian players will be available closer to the release. To keep pace with the multi-lingual European growth of World of Warcraft and development of other games, Blizzard is currently hiring for numerous open positions. More information on available career opportunities at Blizzard Europe, including positions on the Russian team, can be found at http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobopp (http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobopp). <br />

Attack range bugs<br />
Tharfor made a fairly interesting post about bugs affecting tauren druids, and sometimes even other classes (last part).<br />
The attack range as a tauren in humanoid form is slightly longer than when you're shapeshifted in cat form. <br />
The server check making sure that your target is in front of you before landing an attack is much more thorough than the standard auto-attack. This applies to all classes. (Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Pc8ADOUlWs))<br />
<br />
The Tauren character model has a larger attack range than other humanoid models; the feral form models do not benefit from this as the feral form is no longer a Tauren. Simply put: when you shapeshift to a smaller form (feral), you will need to get closer in order to attack – this is not a bug.<br />
<br />
We also received a video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Pc8ADOUlWs (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Pc8ADOUlWs)) which shows auto-attacks hitting a target which is behind the player, but the special abilities do not. This was investigated and it was discovered that the ‘target is in front’ check for abilities is much more thorough than the standard auto-attack. This applies to all classes.<br />

Group loots bugs<br />
It seems that some items from quests, skinning, herbalism, etc ... now counts as group loot. This is a known issue and a fix will be included in a future patch. (Source (http://This is a known issue and a fix will be included in a future patch.))<br />

3rd profession on characters<br />
For the moment, the answer is &quot;not going to happen&quot;. World of Warcraft is a multiplayer game, it is meant to have communities and have you interact with other people to accomplish certain things. I have played on a high population and a low population realm and while some rare recipes were a little harder to find on the low population realm, I definitely could find them and just had to put some effort into communicating with the proper player and meeting up with them. In the end I don't really see a reason to add a 3rd profession to my characters other than convenience and making things easier.

Backpack: Bigger is better<br />

Now it's been fixed. The personal rating will be gone within 2 months. When people are complaining left and right about having arena points they cannot spend that will be the end of the personal rating for arena.</div></div><hr />

Actually, you're still wrong.<br />
<br />
The exploit was being able to get a 1850 personal rating with a team rating around ~1700, minimum.<br />
<br />
You can't farm teams at 1000 like youre saying and still get personal rating points. They have to be within 150-200 points for you to get 1 point for every win.<br />
<br />
So yeah, you're still clueless.</div></div><hr />

Can't that still be easily worked around by swapping out players on a 1850/2000 team just to visit the vendor? Seems like it will just be a minor inconvenience to players who are abusing the system anyway.</div></div><hr />

Acutally it can't. As was stated previous to the Season 3 launch, your personal rating for that particular roster is reset to 1500 once you join a new team.</div></div><hr />

<br />
correct, and this change is much needed, especially after seeing that team with a 3000 personal rating in the first day of s3. clearly it was bugged. having both just means that you cant join a team just to buy weapons, the team has to be at 2k, and you have to be responsible for that. imo it makes perfect sense and i wish they would enforce personal ratings in more areas.</div></div><hr />

I think what he was saying is that this will encourage team boosting again. If you can't break 1700, you're an idiot. So people will do what they've been doing for the past few weeks, cheesing the system to get a 1700 team/1850 personal rating, then pay two people who are actually decent players to come on the team, and just win games till the team rating matches their personal rating.<br />
<br />
Congrats blizzard, you just re-introduced a new facet of economics into the system that is buying and selling arena teams.</div></div><hr />

i made 2k gold casually boosting 3v3 last season (some people on our server made 15k+), and given i have weapon and shoulders (or should today), i fully welcome boosting again, 3g per rating is the going rate lol.<br />
<br />
incoming change from blizzard, team rating/personal rating, 75% matches played requirement on weapons. this is the next logical step imo, before simply ticketing a GM to give you your weapons.</div></div><hr />

Ye I made around 15k gold myself doing boosts in 2v2, mainly 3v3 and some 5v5.<br />
I see ways people can get boosted through this requirement aswell..</div></div><hr />

<br />
yup same idea as always, and if your alts are the ones who played it down to 1k they will still get the points from the 2k team rating lol.<br />
<br />
arena points based on personal rating anyone?</div></div><hr />

Clearly, you have no clue about the feral range bug. It's been a problem since closed beta for retail and has been reported many times. It just shows where Blizzard's priorities are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Buying and selling arena teams still happens. Crappy players will still buy a 2k+ team and then nurse it downwards for a few weeks to get points from it. All you guys that are crying about how re-introducing the team rating is going to lead to &quot;buying and selling teams coming back&quot; are somehow managing to miss that it still happens a ton.</div></div><hr />
