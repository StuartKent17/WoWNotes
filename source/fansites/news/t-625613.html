Also, some people have been complaining about the FPS drop they're getting since the release of Wrath of the Lich King, if you're using a Nvidia card and do not update your drivers often you might want to check the Forceware 180.48 (Win XP (http://www.nvidia.com/object/winxp_180.48_whql.html) / Vista (http://www.nvidia.com/object/winvista_x86_180.48_whql.html)) drivers released a few days after the expansion. (I'm only bringing this up now because my framerate surprisingly improved when I updated, it doesn't mean that it will work with you but it definitely helps for some people)<br />

AoE Healing and dungeon difficulty<br />
Heroic Loken is hard. He’s the hardest heroic boss. Having a priest may make the encounter easier, but it doesn’t make it tirival and having a paladin doesn’t mean you are almost certainly doomed to fail. Honestly it has a lot more to do with what the rest of the group is doing to minimize the damage they take than what the healer has to do to keep everyone up.<br />
<br />
Malygos is a slightly different situation. We kept amping up the damage of Vortex because CoH and WG could just easily heal through it. We finally decided those two spells were just OP and pushing priests and druids into just relying on that one spell too much. With the cooldown on COH and WG we will probably nerf the Vortex. I say probably because players are farming the encounter already so I’m not 100% that things will go from farm to impossible with this change, but we’ll be sure to test it out a lot and watch for your feedback.

Game balancing and top guilds<br />
I'm not sure we could ever nail the balance of the game so perfectly that even the most cutting edge raiding guilds would bring the player not the class. But these guilds are so selective in who they bring and train their guys so much that they can make an assumption (which most of our guilds can't make), which is that all of their players are very, very good.<br />
<br />
I know of guilds that have people respec tradeskills for certain encounters (or at least did in BC). That's kind of at a level beyond whether shamans and death knights bring the same buffs, or whether warriors and paladins can both tank the same boss.

<br />
Healing Meters<br />
Healing meters are a silly way of measuring healer performance. Often it's when and who you heal that is much more important than how much you heal. But measuring healing is very difficult, so players tend to go back to meters.<br />
<br />
I agree that if a team is beating the boss then their setup works. But sometimes raids wonder if they should have brought a different person or what would happen if someone respec'd so they start to wonder who their best healers are.

Bugs with Judgements<br />
We are trying to track this issue (Judgements sometimes failing) down. We aren't sure what is causing this and we can't come up with a situation that causes it reliably so we can figure out what's happening. More information from players about what situations seem to reproduce the bug will be more helpful than just posting &quot;still happening&quot; over and over. Yes, we know it is still happening. We just don't know why. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12454540455-judgement-is-broken.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Healing meters matter for:<br />
1) Healers on the same assignment<br />
2) Same class healers<br />
3) Single target healers that beat AoE healers.<br />
<br />
Back in the beginning of BC I was a resto druid. Not only could I not AOE heal, but I couldn't even flash heal the raid to spam meters, just HoT and have it get overwritten. I was still top 3 on our meters (horde 2nd guild at the time, went to horde 1st shortly after. Nothing special in worldwide rankings, but not awful.) AND was the last to go oom.<br />
<br />
If I had been an officer in that guild I would have had some serious talks with most of our healers based on those heal meters.</div></div><hr />

The game is 4 years old, the graphics aren't. The dynamic shadows probably aren't helping the framerate in Terokkar. ^^<br />

<br />
As far as what healer is taken, that really is irrelevant as it really depends on the players for getting back into his range and preventing the debuff from causing too much damage. I am a holy paladin and even when we didn't know what to do I kept us alive for the most part (of course we wiped to learn) so I don't think it matters what healer is there really.</div></div><hr />

I can't say I remember any major bug / balance patches that happened during the middle of an arena season.<br />
<br />
I'd expect them to push the season's start back a bit, and put up the patch the day of or the day before (much like many other season starts).<br />
<br />
Considering that many of the fixes are class targeted and/or bug fixes, and nothing major has been implemented... What is the possibility that they won't even use a PTR? There are a lot of extra programers working, and internal testing for such a minor patch could definitely be possible.</div></div><hr />

&quot;learn.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's pretty fucking obvious, seeing as you take a tick every second based on how far you are from the boss. Unless NO ONE in your group moved until you wiped, it would be pretty obvious.<br />
<br />
Actually, it should be noticeable b/c tank/melee take 400 damage while casters take 4000. HMMM MAYBE I SHOULD GET CLOSE.<br />
<br />
Also any time a boss stands still and starts a long cast, IT'S USUALLY SOMETHING YOU SHOULD RUN AWAY FROM.<br />

This boss is retardedly easy, I did it on normal in a level 77-78 group, and in heroic the day I hit 80. 1 shot it both times.<br />

<br />
Which OS are you using?<br />
If you are using XP, then I can say that those drivers also caused similar crashes and BSODs on my system. Good thing you rolled back, better wait for another version.<br />
The Vista ones are flawless however.<br />
<br />
I have XP and Vista on different partitions, and up until now I used XP for WoW because it ran much better than on Vista.<br />
I then heard, from this news item, that the new drivers might improve my framerate so I decided to give 'em a try.<br />
<br />
At first, after installation, I had constant BSODs and crashes. I then uninstalled the drivers in safe mode, did a cleanup of all the nvidia leftovers with Driver Sweeper, and then installed the drivers again.<br />
It seemed fine for a while, but I kept getting flickering textures in WoW and every 1-2 hours I would get a BSOD or a &quot;driver stopped responding&quot; message.<br />
<br />
I then decided to boot Vista and see if those drivers are any different on this OS.<br />
To my surprise, not only they work perfectly well, but they improved my FPS by more than 100%. Really.<br />
I used to have like 20fps in Dalaran, now I'm getting around 40-50.<br />
<br />
The only thing that I don't like about the Vista drivers is that I have to start using vista again :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aikouka</div><div class="date">2008-12-08, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm I'll have to see if there have been any new ATi Catalyst releases lately. I believe I'm on 8.10 (Oct) or 8.11 (Nov), but not entirely sure. I have no qualms playing a single WoW at once on my 4870 (512MB version unfortunately), but if I attempt to play two WoWs... Northrend makes my PC look like it's nothing more than a Tandy. I'm pretty sure it's an issue with the video memory being too low though. I used to have an 8800GTX 768MB video card and when I switched, the RAM use (while playing two WoWs at once) went up 100MB a pop... and the difference in VRAM between the two cards is about... 200MB (a little more but work with me). <br />
<br />
Video cards since the days of AGP have been able to use system RAM if they run out of video ram and it looks like I'm running out and it really shows in Dalaran (with two clients open (in windowed mode), the game is a slideshow sometimes). My thought was possibly to go with a dual-card solution, but not SLi or Crossfire... simply using one card to drive one monitor and another card to drive the other. But I'm really not that affluent with dual-gpus working separately like that... anyone have any good advice? Just need me some good workin' WoW.<br />
<br />
Oh and I assume GC meant Loken was hard on the healers but conceptually his damage abilities aren't hard to grasp. I've actually heard about him before this post from a priest friend of mine and how annoying he can be to heal for.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kartu3</div><div class="date">2008-12-08, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uhm, so GC sort of said that 2k dps difference between 2 equally skilled players (say a hunter and an elem shammie) matters ONLY TO TOP GUILD, and most guys posting in that thread just swallowed it.<br />
<br />
What a pity that I can only post on EU forums... :(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frott</div><div class="date">2008-12-08, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all:<br />
<br />
Loken with two priests in the group toggling POH = automatic win on heroic. I know everyone loves to run with tank/dps/dps/dps/heal but back in TBC you were foolish to attempt early, undergeared, pre-nerfed heroics without two healers or main/off healer. <br />
<br />
The strat is to just spread out and heal through everything. The fight is shorter because you're doing dps 100% of the time. The mechanics of the fight make any pet classes bad to have because you can't spread as much. We use the circle in front of his throne to do it. Cheese fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly:<br />
The malygos encounter has people's panties in a bunch because of vortex. The only heals that can happen during vortex are instants. THE PROBLEM WITH THE HEALING IS NOT DURING VORTEX, ITS PRIOR.<br />
<br />
My job as coh priest is obviously to spam coh during vortex. But that became completely irrelevant when I learned that the REAL strategy to this fight is to simply make sure heal over time spells are ticking on everyone before vortex happens. So I simply renew everyone, hopefully while standing in a spark, pre-mending, and that's that.<br />
<br />
There is little or no difference to this part than whining about Maexxna: you need heals over time or preventative healing in place before the raid gets wrapped or else you fail.<br />
<br />
<br />
So really, bringing up malygos as an obvious reason why priests are overpowered is completely ignorant (worse than saying Loken is the hardest encounter in a heroic). <br />
<br />
People look at meters and hate it that a priest in garbage gear can &quot;outheal them&quot; in their epics by spamming COH. Sorry, but that's the role of the priest. I guarantee that that same priest's pointless meter score drops to nothing on patchwerk if they're specced to buff COH and not buff greater heal, because get this: that coh specced priest is not the idea single target healer. Even if they spec for it.<br />
<br />
So no, saying that priests are jack of all trades and master of none is ridiculous. I agree that COH needs fine tuning, but hacking it down at the knees is simply going to make the same shaman stacking nonsense that was in sunwell for chain heal a reality again. Even moreso because of how bad VE is now.<br />
<br />
If I spec for COH, I expect to do the majority of the healing because i'm healing the &quot;raid&quot; and not focusing on the tanks. Someone, at the end of the day, is going to be the best raid healer and it is fruitless to whine when it isn't you. Making it shaman spamming chain instead of priests spamming COH is irrelevant. In case you missed it, they've botched the utility of our buffs in that priests are the one class that have nearly full coverage. Spirit, Improved Spirit are useless. Fort can be handled by shadow. Where's our aura? Our reason to bring us over that other paladin or shaman.<br />
<br />
If they insist that we're meant to be this &quot;does a lot of stuff mediocrely&quot; class they shouldn't be surprised when it goes back to the old &quot;paladins for direct, druids for hot, shaman for group&quot; ways again. <br />
<br />
That, or, they could put the damage reduction and shields on some sort of parsable log so that we can see how disc is REALLY stacking up.<br />
<br />
The mystery amount of reduction from grace, the fact that shields aren't parsed<br />
(how hard is it to say Blahblah absorbed 1200 from CASTER'S Power Word Shield) anyway? This is foolish at this point in the game.</div></div><hr />
