The Tauren Heritage Armor quest chain is now available for testing on the PTR. It requires you to have a level 120 Tauren that is exalted with Thunder Bluff to start the chain.<br />
<br />
<br />
The quest &quot;When Spirits Whisper&quot; begins at the Orgrimmar Embassy. Spiritwalker Isahi informs you that Chieftain Baine Bloodhoof has requested your presence in Thunder Bluff.<br />
Upon arriving, Baine explains that the spiritwalkers have been troubled lately by visions of chaos and turmoil, and the spirits have whispered your name. He asks you to meet with Spiritwalker Ussoh at Fargaze Mesa in Camp Narache.<br />
At the top of the mesa, you are instructed to sit and commune with the ancestors by lighting an incense. Upon doing so, you witness a kodo in dire pain and Ussoh says that must mean the spirits are issuing a warning. He suggests you enter the spirit realm at once and tells you to meet him at Sun Rock Retreat in Stonetalon Mountains.<br />
There, you begin the ritual and are tasked with meeting with your spirit guide on the other side, which turns out to be the kodo from the earlier vision. You follow it up a nearby hill in the spirit realm, and eventually it is attacked by a a void spirit, who sends its minions upon the guide. Upon defeating them, the spirit retreats through a portal and the kodo guide reveals itself as an ancient chieftain, Iti. She says the spirit realm is out of balance with dark spirits crossing over into the mortal world. She tasks you with warning the Tauren.<br />
Ussoh says that having a spirit guide that is a chieftain is a great honor, and tasks you with heading to Bloodhoof Village in Mulgore to stop the spirit attack.<br />
All of Mulgore is shrouded in darkness when you arrive. You reach Bloodhoof Village and rescue it from the attacks, but are then pulled to Thunder Bluff by Baine sounding the horn that it is under attack.<br />
When you arrive, you help Baine take down the spirit from Stonetalon Mountains with the help of your ancestor. Periodically throughout the fight, Chieftain Iti will appear with a glowing circle around her. Standing in it grants you a stacking buff that increases your damage by 100%. <br />
When you defeat the spirit, Baine tells you to get rid of it for good, but he is interrupted by the spirits of his father, Carine, and his mother. Cairne tells him that they have already saved the spirit realm and balance is needed between light and shadow to see what lies before us. Baine pleads for them to stay and talk, but Cairne says that is for another time. The two fade after telling Baine that they are proud of him and continue to watch over him.<br />
Baine then sends you to a nearby cliff to light an incense to honor the ancestors. Upon doing so, your spirit guide Iti appears and grants you the Heritage of the Taur-ahe (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/291621-heritage-of-the-taur-ahe) (Ancestral Chieftain's Armor). You also receive the Ancient Tauren Talisman (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/167860-ancient-tauren-talisman), which summons your spirit guide for a brief moment.<br />

Ok<br />
<br />
It was never actually all that bad, just people used it wrong then moaned and it got a bad rep ;). Its ok if you want to just check azerite quick or get a rough idea. Tested it a few times and majority of the time it gets me within 100dps of raidbots best list. It just works different to simcraft not all on stat weights but real data iir (combat logs).</div></div><hr />

Whole heritage/allied race stuff in general is quite flawed.<br />

<br />
You say it's not that bad, and but you have no idea why it got a bad rep? <br />
It wasn't people using it wrong, it legitimately gives wrong information, the rotations it uses are wrong, the recommendations are wrong. Class communities have spent a lot of time going through AMR to write up lists of things that were incorrect on it. <br />
<br />
Worth looking through rets one, they had a list of around 80 errors AMR has for ret pally alone. Which they tried to contact and sort out with AMR, and got ignored. <br />
All specs have a similar situation to that. <br />
<br />
Everyone should be warned against AMR, and aim to use raidbots. Why use something that's often incorrect but can fluke it and be right, over something that just IS right? <br />
<br />
Raidbots also doesn't work off stat weights. You're extremely misinformed. And AMR works off a basis of their incorrect APLs (proven to be incorrect) on top of combat logs going off ilvl percentile (not real percentile, they pick a random person doing well for their ilvl bracket when someone at 413 can sim 24k or 29k). <br />
<br />
AMR is that bad, because it's meant to help to decide the optimal gear to use, and all its ways of going about that, are flawed. Everything it does is flawed because they're trying to do a care bear &quot;real scenario&quot; system, and they're just getting it wrong over and over again.</div></div><hr />

i dont get why you keep comming to this forum when is clear you hate the game.<br />
<br />
But you couldnt be more wrong, just for the look on my server there are multilpel void elf and Dark Iron and now Kultirans moving around, the less popular u could said is Light forge Drenai.<br />

<br />
<br />
What content would you replace it with?<br />
<br />
no meter what content blizzard made the will bitch about, that what this forums become now.<br />
<br />
Wait till patch 8.2 droop and they will complain how they need to farm stuff on Mechagon or how bad the essence system is. <br />
<br />
WoW community become a super picky community is never happy and they always complain. <br />
<br />
Probabbly the heritage armor are one of the most cool race thing introduce on game since the racial mount from pvp back on MoP. <br />
Im glad blizzard ignore this forum</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raidbots treats tanks as they should be, too complex to be put into a 1 sim fits all box. It's not treating it like a second class citizen, it's acknowledging you can't sim for tanks. <br />
<br />
Also, how does raidbots have the symptom if &quot;have the mindset of method or get out&quot; it literally simulates your rotation being done correctly, and shows you what gear is best for you. That's it. Seems like you have some weird issues.</div></div><hr />

Thing is everything to you and a few others is flawed, so not surprised to see you hating on WoW as per usual, since it seems you have nothing better to do, surprised you are not playing your beloved FFXIV.. Oh and one other thing I leveled a Lightforged Draenei Priest and I like the look of the heritage armor..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally did the quest as you can see from the pictures, and it was the kodo, who was your spirit guide for the quest chain. Using the item summoned the kodo, and the tooltip for the item says &quot;summons your spirit guide&quot; so I figured based on my experiences that it was the kodo. Had nothing to do with outside sources.</div></div><hr />

You don't have to level a new toon. That is only for Allied Races. The 120 Tauren exalted with Thunder Bluff can start the quest.</div></div><hr />

Ayyy Eleccybubb is back with more negative comments regarding WoW related things. It's a shame we're not all playing that successful Final Fantasy game, right? Or is it Elder Scrolls?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh for fuck sake... The people who develop and spend time doing the heritage armor are NOT the same people who spend time making &quot;content&quot; such as raids or whatever. Besides this IS content, as in content is litterally whatever that is added to the game. Oh and this armor is litterally coming in the 8.2 patch, which containts a lot of &quot;content&quot;.<br />

<br />
<br />
It'd be nice if people that have been Tauren since day 1 could get this quest chain automatically instead of leveling an entire other toon....<br />

Erm... Good news then? The Heritage Set for older races requires nothing but two things: Exalted with home city (Thunder Bluff in this case) and a level 120 tauren. Meaning your currently level 120 tauren, not a brand new one which you've leveled from 1-120 after 8.2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah you can just do the quest when the patch drops as long as your Tauren is 120 and exalted with TB. They didn’t want to deter old mains from getting heritage armor. I got it on my Belf paladin ive has since tbc.</div></div><hr />

&quot;5% of the population touches Allied races&quot; seems to be a favourite line to spread right now amongst the usual suspects.

&quot;Why don't they add content instead of cosmetics???&quot; - Cosmetics are a big part of MMORPGs, like it or not. And this Heritage armor (and the others) come in patches also containing raids, new zones, dungeons, quest content, new gearing systems, a reworked AP system etc etc.<br />

&quot;But we want QUALITY CONTENT!!&quot; - Ah yes, let me guess, &quot;quality content&quot; as in whatever obscure shit you can make up that isn't what we're getting just to have some fuel for that whine parade.<br />

I can't tell if are you berating me thinking that I am whinging or what??

It wasn't people using it wrong, it legitimately gives wrong information, the rotations it uses are wrong, the recommendations are wrong. Class communities have spent a lot of time going through AMR to write up lists of things that were incorrect on it. <br />
<br />
Worth looking through rets one, they had a list of around 80 errors AMR has for ret pally alone. Which they tried to contact and sort out with AMR, and got ignored. <br />
All specs have a similar situation to that. <br />
<br />
Everyone should be warned against AMR, and aim to use raidbots. Why use something that's often incorrect but can fluke it and be right, over something that just IS right? <br />
<br />
Raidbots also doesn't work off stat weights. You're extremely misinformed. And AMR works off a basis of their incorrect APLs (proven to be incorrect) on top of combat logs going off ilvl percentile (not real percentile, they pick a random person doing well for their ilvl bracket when someone at 413 can sim 24k or 29k). <br />
<br />
AMR is that bad, because it's meant to help to decide the optimal gear to use, and all its ways of going about that, are flawed. Everything it does is flawed because they're trying to do a care bear &quot;real scenario&quot; system, and they're just getting it wrong over and over again.<br />
<br />
Raidbots made things easy thankfully, if we were still stuck with regular old simcraft I'd still be all over AMR because of the simplicity.<br />
<br />
As would many people, people flock to simplicity, whether it's wrong or not. Why do you think icy-veins is so heavily used over each classes website or google docs? It's all there in one place.</div></div><hr />

FFXIV is equally focused on the cosmetic side, and has a shop too where they recently released a whale mount, which is hilarious. <br />
<br />
The toys on the Blizzard store don't screw over collectors in any shape or form, every single toy achievement can easily be earned by collecting the 500+ toys earnable in-game.<br />
<br />
You're grasping to whole new levels at this point.<br />

You don't have to give a shit about those things unless you want to, although player behaviour and feedback shaped the game so these things being prevalent is sort of telling.<br />

It's not treating it like a second class citizen, it's acknowledging you can't sim for tanks. <br />
<br />
Also, how does raidbots have the symptom if &quot;have the mindset of method or get out&quot; it literally simulates your rotation being done correctly, and shows you what gear is best for you. That's it. Seems like you have some weird issues.<br />
<br />
The problem is that AMR gives just plain bad info regarding tanks. Better to just hit your class Discord. If anyone suggests that their info is wrong in any way they just say &quot;we're right rather than your feelycraft&quot;. Tanking has too much nuance for AMR's approach to work well.</div></div><hr />

For some classes IV is the best guide or as good as others. Hunter for example, hunters guide writer there is a top tier hunter with a community of people helping him to make sure the guide is always top notch. But other IV spec pages don't have that sort of backing. <br />
<br />
Though I agree if we had to do the old simcraft, people would stick to AMR for simplicity 100%. Surely the reason people still use it, is because they don't know how simple raidbots currently is. There is nothing AMR does, that raidbots doesn't do better and simply.<br />

<br />
Yeah, I agree. I don't think AMR or Raidbots should step into the world of trying to sim tanks. It should be left to class discords/communities who know how to work out what's best for tanks, who put in the effort and testing and theorycrafting. <br />
<br />
Expecting raidbots to manage tanks because AMR does, makes no sense. Because AMRs tank information sucks. It's wanting information for the sake of information, whether it's wrong or not.</div></div><hr />

Allied races especially when only 5% of the population is touching them and which begs the question how many of those people actually levelled because I rarely see people in the armor.<br />
<br />
Thats because many of the armors are for specific classes. I have a nightborne hunter but the heritage armor is a mage/spellcaster armor, it looks stupid on a hunter. Same with lightforged Draenai, that screems paladin armor.<br />
<br />
Aside from that i like the allied races, i leveled 3 to 120 and one is lv 104. I like leveling and the races give me a reason to do so.</div></div><hr />
