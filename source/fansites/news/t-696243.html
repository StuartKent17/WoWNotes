Don't forget that the real yogg hardmode was +0 which was not needed for the meta, and it made the encounter much harder compared to +1</div></div><hr />

Once bitten, twice shy.<br />
<br />
just look sucky....<br />
<br />
Actually these are among the easiest achievements to get.<br />
<br />
Portal Jockey (10 man) : <br />
3 people in the raid has to be buffed every 30 or so seconds. That's not an achievement, it makes it easier! Send in two healers and a mage or someone else that wants mana and dps.<br />
<br />
Once bitten, twice shy (10 man):<br />
As a tank or healer this is extremely easy, but nonetheless; if you can kill her then three+ people don't get bitten (talking 10 man here) before she dies.<br />
Just rotate those three people over 5 resets and voila, your entire 25man setup has gotten it :p<br />
With high dps, we managed to give 5 people in a single 10 man raid this achievement in one go.<br />
<br />
They're all quite easy except some of the hard mode clears, but rating by achievements I've tried myself, the hardest 3 in 10 man are probably (in this order:)<br />
<br />
1 Full House (RNG mob transformations ftl:p)<br />
2 Nausea, Heartburn, Intergestion (dps has to be decent)<br />
3 Dances With Oozes (someone that probably never did it before has to kite one big slime at the end. Two people if the dps is shit. And they have to stay away from each other. Maybe this has to be the hardest one:o)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Glory of the Ulduar raider didn't require Algalon either IIRC. Yogg 0 and Algalon were intended to be the hardest fights in the tier, in practice, that's not exactly true but it was close.<br />
<br />
If Arthas HM is supposed to be as difficult as Yogg 0, it's not that surprising to see why they left it off the meta. Anyone who's compared 1 light to alone can tell you there's a huge ramp up in difficulty and strats between the two.</div></div><hr />

Check out where your guild is in progressionranking. Move your eyes up about 3000 spots, and you should find them...<br />

<br />
But on another note:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They're all quite easy except some of the hard mode clears, but rating by achievements I've tried myself, the hardest 3 in 10 man are probably (in this order:)<br />
<br />
1 Full House (RNG mob transformations ftl:p)<br />
2 Nausea, Heartburn, Intergestion (dps has to be decent)<br />
3 Dances With Oozes (someone that probably never did it before has to kite one big slime at the end. Two people if the dps is shit. And they have to stay away from each other. Maybe this has to be the hardest one:o)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I wouldn't put these first, but as you said, these are the ones you've tried yourself. <br />
<br />
Full House: Requires some patience, but isn't that hard imo<br />
Nausea, Heartburn...: This does indeed require some good dps. But if you care about clearing the Hardmodes, this shouldn't be a problem ;)<br />
Dances with Oozes: Again, this shouldn't be a problem with good dps, as you can pretty much kill the boss with the normal tactic, and in the end use a second kiter.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the Buffet from Sindragosa should be about the most annoying of all. You've got only very little room for errors and may have to adjust your tactic, to keep an ice block from P2 into P3 to make sure your tanks can reset fast enough. (Or can you actually use any normal LOS methods in this room?)<br />
<br />
Another one is probably, killing the Vile Spirits before they explode in the LK encounter. This highly favors ranged stacking, unless there is a trick I don't know yet.</div></div><hr />

I find the fanboys that call people envious or jealous to be the most fun. It's so deliciously silly I won't even start with it. Nice try though.</div></div><hr />

Hint: read the whole post and not just the part where I bash the hater. If you still don't get it - I edited the text :p find the solution why your post is pretty stupid yourself.<br />
Only because I say you opinion is stupid, doesn't mean I think others are better. You know you ALL get to involved over this whole thing. LET IT F'ING DIE! It's annoying -.- Nobody cares if you like or hate some guild. Really.<br />
<br />
and I'm right. I don't talk shit about Ensidia and this makes me a fanboy. I'm pretty good, heh? ;)</div></div><hr />

By the way, it really funny. Blizz opened a new russian realm &#1056;&#1077;&#1074;&#1091;&#1097;&#1080;&#1081; &#1060;&#1100;&#1086;&#1088;&#1076; a couple of weeks ago, a lot of good guilds transferred to it, and it became #1 world realm in a blink :&#1056;</div></div><hr />

also a clever move to focus on the 10man because the top 10 guilds focus on 25. WF are also about planning and setting the right focus for your guild. so, well played.</div></div><hr />

I was wondering how the fuck a realm called &quot;Howling Fjord&quot; got a world first. (Blizz always names the new realms something topical, so you can tell all the awful realms here in the US because they're named things like &quot;Netherstorm,&quot; &quot;The Scryers,&quot; &quot;Grizzly Hills,&quot; etc.... All the good realms have been around since Vanilla and aren't named after zones/factions in TBC/Wrath.</div></div><hr />

You seem to have quite an ensidia obsession there, zagnaphein. <br />
<br />
Some posts from your posthistory;<br />
&quot;Everyone has the right to critise whenever they want and again what's with u? Are you an Ensidia member or just a fanboy?&quot;<br />
&quot;And to all Ensida fanboys if u tell us to improve our PVE&quot;<br />
&quot;I just hate the promotion Ensidia get&quot;<br />
&quot;So since ensidia fail worldwide we will now promote them as EU first?&quot;<br />
&quot;It suck's to be Ensidia fanboy now that they fail eh?...Poow boy...&quot;<br />
&quot;Down the post they got banned for 3 days! woohoo!!!!&quot;<br />

PvP isn't hard, it takes time reflexes and understanding of your and most other classes and combos, yes, skill and intelligence to some degree, but PvE requires a different kind of skill, but still skill nonetheless and I myself find PvE more rewarding, satisfying and fun, which is why we're here, so cry less.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
my guess is:<br />
<br />
since its clear that LK hardmode cant be downed with the gear people have atm, most guilds are runing and reruning 10man and 25man hardmodes to gear up fast (with the help of those damn ALT raids) and than go try LK. Since there is only 1 WF left i think most guilds arent really forcing on putricide.</div></div><hr />

Why are we having this discussion is just weird to begin with.<br />
To end this discussion, Europe's geography ends in the east, at the Urals, while most of Russia lies in Asian part, the vast majority of Russians live in the European part. That makes them European, capish?<br />
Also, eu means both Europe n European Union, short for both.<br />
End of story.</div></div><hr />

Or at least look at your own map which makes it quite obvious. <br />
<br />
True, but most ppl live in the European part. :)<br />
Its Eurasia :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SilverLynx</div><div class="date">2010-02-18, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hint: read the whole post and not just the part where I bash the hater. If you still don't get it - I edited the text :p find the solution why your post is pretty stupid yourself.<br />
Only because I say you opinion is stupid, doesn't mean I think others are better. You know you ALL get to involved over this whole thing. LET IT F'ING DIE! It's annoying -.- Nobody cares if you like or hate some guild. Really.<br />
<br />
and I'm right. I don't talk shit about Ensidia and this makes me a fanboy. I'm pretty good, heh? ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually you blasted someone who really wasn't saying anything negative at all. They asked where Ensidia was - you torched the hell out of him for it.<br />
<br />
So let's say you're somehow not a fanboy - okay - you're just tired of &quot;meanies&quot; picking on other guilds that said &quot;meanies&quot; can't compare to!<br />
<br />
But asking where they are isn't an insult. Asking where they are is just a question - perhaps asking if Ensidia was racing to this achievement, or if Ensidia even cares about the 10 man. Hell, he could have even been worried that all this drama had made Ensidia quit! Several people responded to his question with a link to Ensidia's wowprogress. He responded with thanks. Clearly he didn't have said link. Clearly everyone got it that he was inquiring about Ensidia, as a potential fan or at least as a curious party.<br />
<br />
But not you! You exploded in righteous fire that HOW DARE anyone who is not better than Ensidia ask about them!?! And you couldn't let your original flame stand - no you had to go out of your way to embarrass the poor dude, come back and edit in his 'shameful' world rank.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't make you a drooling fanboy, I don't know what does!<br />
<br />
Next time, maybe don't go out of your way to tear apart anyone who asks about what you think are touchy subjects - not everyone who has an account here posts every single day and knows what the touchy subjects are. <br />

<br />
To the people who are trying to figure out whether Russia is EU or Asia - geography doesn't matter. If they get the patch on the same day as a group of servers and are grouped with said servers, they fall where Blizzard says they fall. Which is in Europe.<br />
<br />
Russian progression on a EU-Russian server is EU progression. <br />
<br />
Yes, that might be silly because they could be on Asian servers, but they aren't so why freak out about it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
so true it boggles my mind that people had time to go and look up member states of the EU, and the Geographical location of Russia, but forgot to check the Realm lists and see which sector the russian realms are listed as....<br />
<br />

<br />
Depends if you count pre-nerf C'thun as being &quot;possible.&quot; If not it will probably take about 6 years of LK not being dead for people to admit it is harder than Muru or Yogg0.</div></div><hr />

Considering the limited try approach, 6 years sounds about right.</div></div><hr />

I was just checking their DPS logs, and someone was using saronite bombs,<br />
SO!<br />
Grats on 72 hour ban and removal of achievements/loots!<br />
<br />
<br />
1st off, they removed the siege damage component temporarily, therefore fixing the bug until blizzard stop siege damage from really fixing it..<br />
2nd off, lots of people actually USE saronite bombs for dps.<br />
3rd off, you have made only two posts, one of them is the above, utterly retarded, and the other is the one on the same page about germans getting practice &quot;clearing&quot; with jews.<br />
<br />
I hope YOU get a ban before this cancerous drivel continues.</div></div><hr />

Before you go telling other people to learn anything, hit up a wikipedia or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
OR people could look at a map and see that Russia is in Europe AND Asia. It is divided along the Ural Mountains. Source (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Google FTW.....incase you are too lazy Let me google that for you (http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=russian+continent).<br />
<br />
As far as the WWII humor, that was lame and offensive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Grats to the guilds that accomplished feats that most that post on here never will.</div></div><hr />

It says in the thread that it is a 310%</div></div><hr />

in russian it means: gratz guys, keep moving on ;D i'm proud of Exorsus... 8)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ottius</div><div class="date">2010-02-20, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By the way, it really funny. Blizz opened a new russian realm &#1056;&#1077;&#1074;&#1091;&#1097;&#1080;&#1081; &#1060;&#1100;&#1086;&#1088;&#1076; a couple of weeks ago, a lot of good guilds transferred to it, and it became #1 world realm in a blink :&#1056;<br />
<br />
<br />
&#1043;&#1086;&#1088;&#1076;&#1091;&#1085;&#1085;&#1080; and &#1057;&#1074;&#1077;&#1078;&#1077;&#1074;&#1072;&#1090;&#1077;&#1083;&#1100; &#1076;&#1091;&#1096; already were #1 and #2 respectively. So, no surprise there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Since when Russia is EU ???<br />
<br />
<br />
Since like after the dinosaurs died.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The EU is a political formation that has nothing at all to do with geography, and Russia (and other european countries) aren't in it.<br />
Before you go telling other people to learn anything, hit up a wikipedia or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
By EU Blizzard meant European continent, you silly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EU != Europe<br />
EU = European Union<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union<br />
<br />
<br />
They (Blizz) just decided to mark the European zone with the same principle they used to mark the US zone with the ISO 2-letter country codes.</div></div><hr />
