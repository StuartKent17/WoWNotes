Maybe if you could drive the &quot;tanks&quot;, use fly-copters, lead 20-50 soldiers behind you, upgrade NPC abilities, gain power / horde kills, build barricades on roads, have ways to attack the enemy base (like rogue operations); but yeah those things cannot be copy-pasted and you have no money to do actual work.<br />

I wonder how low have sub numbers go to see actual fixing of gameplay and progression...<br />

<br />
For real? <br />
<br />
Bats are the most iconic flying mount for the Horde since Wc3. They've been used extensively for Undead and trolls ever since. <br />
<br />
It's ridiculous that the last patch was the FIRST time we've had a bat even added to the game for players (outside of the store one). And people are complaining that the second one is &quot;too many bats&quot; already? This is an awesome mount for the Horde.<br />

Ally one can fly too - using the power of sparkles!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, for everyone mocking the &quot;Horde favouritism&quot; of the mounts so far in BFA, you must be willfully ignorant. The whole horse fiasco is a pisstake. Not only is it the same model for all mounts, with saddle graphics copy and pasted from other mounts, but they haven't even fixed the running animation for any, and haven't anchored charachters properly so you rock back and forth 90 degrees when riding.</div></div><hr />

Grasping about what?<br />
<br />
About the Bats? Bats are iconic mounts for the Horde - having a second non-store one is great. People have been after bat mounts like these for literally over a decade. <br />
<br />
About the horse mounts? <br />
Blizzard has OBJECTIVELY spent less effort on the Alliance mounts on BfA launch. There's not an argument here - Horde even has whole a quest chain and achievement around one of their new mounts (https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=13030/how-to-ptrain-your-pterrordax). It baffles me that they couldn't even put a wicker beast wolf mount in.</div></div><hr />

At least Kua'fon can be used by both Alliance and the Horde once the mount is learned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah that'd be helpful. Gladiator gear is really annoying for cloaks. All of the other parts of the set are rewards for conquest each week apart from the cloak which was skipped. I've had a whole load of cloaks drop so far, but still not the one that goes with the Leather set :(</div></div><hr />

Malygos would be my guess on 1st vehicle combat.</div></div><hr />

I'm still unconvinced they can make a PvE event fun to play given hotkey WoW mechanics. Would be 100% better if they had pvp a la Alterac Valley.</div></div><hr />

Maybe if you could drive the &quot;tanks&quot;, use fly-copters, lead 20-50 soldiers behind you, upgrade NPC abilities, gain power / horde kills, build barricades on roads, have ways to attack the enemy base (like rogue operations); but yeah those things cannot be copy-pasted and you have no money to do actual work.<br />
<br />
I wonder how low have sub numbers go to see actual fixing of gameplay and progression...<br />
<br />
And WTF is that pvp reward system? My friends and I made a 3man arena team but it turned out you will be rewarded for first win / day... I don't think Blizzard understands or even knows how hard to get 3 people to be up for PVP every day.<br />
You don't only get a reward for the first win of the day, the first win is just guaranteed to give you an item. Every arena game has a chance of giving you items when you win</div></div><hr />

I don't know if you got the memo, but Alterac Valley was shit when people found out that it's faster to avoid the enemy players and strictly run to the boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder how you could have fixed that (speaking as someone who loved the length of alterac valley in vanilla).<br />
<br />
All I can think of was to change the geography so the enemy base wasn't attackable until certain goals had been met (e.g. defenses destroyed). Add back in enemy mobs (like the troll of death in the middle graveyard). Also change the way the honor system worked so you got honor over time instead of just honor when you destroyed towers etc. Maybe included the option to rebuild defenses to help push the opposing side back? Or even add siege engines to finally win the day.<br />
<br />
As is... it's fun but kind of broken and a shadow of what it once was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might have missed the new memo because it isn't really like that anymore. You can't reliably do the boss with even a single tower up. People defend towers like crazy. Usually how it works now is horde sends about half or a bit more on offense and keeps about 10-15 on defense at iceblood and either slows them down or retakes towers while offense takes and holds the first two towers. <br />
Either that or the alliance almost all stay defense and hold stonehearth bunker and stonehearth graveyard at all costs. Either way, its much more interesting than just a base race now.</div></div><hr />

Bats are the most iconic flying mount for the Horde since Wc3. They've been used extensively for Undead and trolls ever since. <br />
<br />
It's ridiculous that the last patch was the FIRST time we've had a bat even added to the game for players (outside of the store one). And people are complaining that the second one is &quot;too many bats&quot; already? This is an awesome mount for the Horde.<br />
<br />
What I mean is that is that if I saw a version of each bat mount in front of me, I couldn't tell which was from the battlefront currency. I can with the tiger. That was my point :)</div></div><hr />

Except that you can't kill the boss with every tower up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In this expansion we got so many horses on the pile of horses that we already have that im actually asking question &quot;OH, ITS NOT A HORSE? HOW COME?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I get your point. Store mounts are meant to be unique and easily distinguishable from &quot;normal&quot; mounts. Having two new bats kinda ruins that experience.<br />
<br />
On other side.. Allies... well.. We have horses... and Gryphons! We even got a Horse in BFA Digital Deluxe Pack, on top of 3 New Horses and Gryphons that we got for reputations on already existing pile.<br />
Honestly, most let-down situation for me was when, after 12 years of playing horde, i have decided to roll as Ally for exp or two, just for the sake of change (and im not a fan of Sylvanas horde too so i guess i kinda deflected), and opened my mounts collection. That damn thing is full of Horses and Gryphons now.</div></div><hr />
