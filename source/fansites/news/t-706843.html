We are going to take the opportunity in Cataclysm to try and fix some of the problems with the Rage mechanic for both warriors and druids. Some of these problems include:<br />
<br />
Warriors/druids in the lowest levels of gear can be Rage-starved.<br />
Warriors/druids in the highest levels of gear no longer have to manage their Rage when it becomes infinite.<br />
Warrior/druid tanks lose Rage income as they improve their gear and take less damage.<br />
The gameplay of warrior and druid tanks loses a lot of depth when massive boss hits means never having to manage Rage.<br />
Heroic Strike and Maul are effective, but tedious abilities for using up extra Rage.<br />
In general, warriors and druids don’t have enough control over their Rage.<br />
<br />
To resolve these issues, Rage will be normalized in Cataclysm. This will make the Rage gained by characters more consistent and avoid drastic differences between low-end and high-end gear.<br />
<br />
The concept of normalized Rage may leave a negative impression on some veteran players, as we tried it once before in The Burning Crusade and it wasn't successful, resulting in them feeling weakened. However, we think that the concept is still sound -- it was just that the previous implementation didn't balance the values correctly, leading to players being Rage-starved. That is not the goal. As part of the change, we want to give warriors and druids a lot of ways to control their rage, so even in the worst-case scenarios they won’t feel like they lack the resource to do their job.<br />
<br />
Here are some of the ways the Rage mechanic will change in Cataclysm:<br />
<br />
1) Rage is no longer generated based on damage done by auto-attacks. Instead, each auto-attack provides a set amount of Rage, and off-hand weapons will generate 50% of the Rage main hands do. This amount is based on a constant formula which factors in the base swing speed of the weapon. This means the Rage gained should be averaged out between fast and slow weapons. The constant formula also gives us the ability to easily increase the rage gained if it feels too low (or reduce it if is too high). We are also implementing the following mechanics, which will still allow rage to improve to some extent as you improve gear:<br />
<br />
If the attack is a critical strike, it will generate 200% Rage.<br />
Haste will accelerate swing times to generate Rage faster.<br />
<br />
2) Rage from damage taken will no longer be based on a standard creature of the character’s level, but instead will based on the health of the warrior or druid. Again, there is a constant that is multiplied by the rage generated in order to allow for fine-tuning. This calculation ignores all damage reduction from armor, absorption, avoidance, block, or similar mechanics, so improving your gear will not reduce Rage gained.<br />
<br />
3) We will provide warriors and druids with more instant sources of rage. For example, the warrior shouts are changing to work more like the death knight ability Horn of Winter. Instead of Battle Shout consuming Rage, it will generate Rage but have a short cooldown. Both classes will have additional methods to generate Rage in an emergency or bleed off Rage when they have too much.<br />
<br />
4) All “on next swing” attacks in Cataclysm are being removed. Heroic Strike and Maul will be instant swings that cost a variable amount of Rage. For example, imagine Heroic Strike costs between 10 and 30 Rage. You must have at least 10 Rage to use the attack, but it will consume all available Rage up to a maximum of 30. Any Rage consumed above the minimum will cause the ability to hit harder, and in some cases much harder. We will tune the ability so that it’s generally not a good idea to hit it when you have low Rage (unless everything else is somehow on cooldown) but becomes a more attractive button the higher your Rage.<br />
<br />
<br />
We understand this change may be scary for many players, but keep in mind that the constants in the formulas for gaining Rage will give us the ability to make quick adjustments if we feel Rage generation is too low. Our goal is for each character's Rage to not be always high or always low, but rather a resource that needs to be managed properly by the player.</div></div><hr />

I sure hope so, cleave is a nice tool, but the fact that it cancels if you switch targets combined with having to wait for the swing to go off can be a real pain sometimes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't really like the idea of 10-30 rage abilities either but that's probably because of the way they nerfed the fun out of Execute (which no longer executes but just slaps you for some damage, as to where Kill Shot really is a Kill Shot). However Im just going to wait and see what the Beta brings to make any decisions yet however Im a bit disappointed (but then again, so was I when they announced Titan's Grip and it's not too bad but 1H&gt;2H imo).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if they turned it into a revenge like ability. Not available unless you dodge/parry, but instantly attacks when used, and given a short cooldown.<br />
<br />
I'm impartial to this news. I've been playing my warrior since a year after release, and the whole rage mechanic is what I liked best about being a DPS warrior. I just hope the rage change isn't going to cause me to dislike playing my warrior. It's definitely too early to say, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HS is a threat tool and rage dump. Execute is a killing tool and rage dump. Warriors are given an ability to create massive threat with tools like HS without putting out tons of dmg. Execute puts out tons of damage in a short period of time to &quot;beat&quot; the incoming heal on the player or mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know why they just don't make Execute like Kill Shot. Big hitting attack but with a cooldown. It's kinda dumb that one of our weakest attacks is called EXECUTE.</div></div><hr />

I certainly do hope they dont screw this up for the sake of making the game more simple, approachable, easier to balance or fix their own design mistakes. Removing majority of stats, normalizing rage gains, simplifying trees, further gear self-customization, i dont really like the direction this game is to take in Cata. Even if the next expansion looks much better so far than the current one in terms of the included features.</div></div><hr />

&quot;A possible solution would be to award a percentage of rage based on damage that WOULD have hit the tank. So, damage which is avoided or mitigated (via shield block or even armor) awards rage in addition to actually getting hit and dealing damage.&quot;<br />

I completely agree. I rather like having a separate cooldown for Maul. Slap it on a macro and I'm a threat machine. Now I'm gonna have to grow a 6th finger to get it into my rotation. ;D<br />

<br />
<br />
No, they're not! Execute consume all of your remaining rage, plus it is not usable on enemies what have more than 20% of their health. New HS will use at least 10 point of rage, but no more than 30 and usable anytime you've got enough rage. There is a difference. Read it again.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurggy</div><div class="date">2010-04-05, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm really excited about the changes to rage, actually. What I'm less enthusiastic about is this blurb about the &quot;change&quot; to haste that they've been promising us for the last couple months that's supposed to make it more attractive for us (since they're taking away armor penetration). <br />
<br />
Haste is extraordinarily expensive because, for classes with cast times, it reduces them, allowing their overall dps to increase at about the same level as their haste, within the limitations of their resource. For us, it has always been overpriced because it only affects our white swings and so we receive about 10% of the haste benefit that caster types get from it. <br />
<br />
Supposedly they were going to to improve the attractiveness of haste for us, and I'm sincerely hoping this isn't all they're bringing to the table, since essentially this change amounts to no change at all.<br />
<br />
I think I'm with other posters about the HS change, I actually think it's likely to change some things about the class, i.e. Bloodsurge can't have the same proc chance/source as it has now, since we won't be using heroic strike often enough to make it the same, but in return we'll be getting an execute like ability to use during the entire combat. That does make the Arms talent a bit lackluster, however, but presumably they'll do something to execute to make it more worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

L2P?? http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=47471 http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48577. Execute is worse tho, cause of the 20% factor, and with Sudden Death talented, you need at least 40 rage for a fully powered Execute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ummm... is this sarcasm?<br />
Execute (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=47471)<br />
<br />
With improved execute, . . . . lessee. . . costs 10 rage, uses up to 30 rage. .. . .<br />
<br />
So the issue is, how is the new HS different than just making execute usable at any time? I don't think the mechanics are really that different, especially if you've played an Arms warrior recently and had the Sudden Death (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=29724) Talent.<br />
<br />
In fact, without modification, HS would actually be preferable to execute, since it could be used during the entire fight without a proc chance. <br />

But certainly the 10 rage minimum and 30 rage maximum is pretty much identical.</div></div><hr />

This sounds like Blizzard is giving all warriors a set amount of rage based on nothing but the fact you swing.<br />
<br />
Also, unless Blizzard greatly changes warriors, specifically fury warriors, there isn't a time to use HS or Cleave. On top of that, we will have been greatly reduced in our ability to damage multiple targets. This sounds like a very poor idea.<br />
<br />
Imagine this situation... Every main hand swing you generate 25 rage, every offhand swing you generate 12.5 rage. You receive this amount of rage every 3 seconds. There is a high chance any swing can, and will, miss. Not being able to change main hand swings to &quot;yellow&quot; attacks effectively turns them from 0% miss to 17% miss (give or take). So, unless blizzard is planing on implementing some change in Titan's grip and hit reduction, I think removing HS has a much further reaching negative then blizzard is willing to admit.<br />
<br />
Simply not &quot;liking&quot; the fact that warriors appear to have no issue with rage is simply because we have adjusted to the system and created our gear to give us no rage issues. This is very similar to healers or mana DPS classes. They have attuned their gear so they do NOT have mana issues! And this is a problem because? Well apparently we are supposed to have headaches with mana and rage.</div></div><hr />

Execute consume all of your remaining rage, plus it is not usable on enemies what have more than 20% of their health. New HS will use at least 10 point of rage, but no more than 30 and usable anytime you've got enough rage. There is a difference. Read it again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Execute only uses a maximum of 30 rage, much like the new HS. You haven't played your warrior since, like, vanilla, haven't you?</div></div><hr />

I like this too, provided that they don't add cooldowns to Demoralizing shout. <br />
<br />
I don't care so much when I'm dps, but since we don't have any good ticking AoE that we can use for area aggro, I sometimes use Demo Shout while running through packs and wait to use TC/Shockwave until I've got the group rounded up. I'd hate to see my ability to do that taken away because they wanted to impose a 20 second cooldown on it so it worked like horn of winter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't forget the one other implementation, that the amount of rage doubles if you crit.<br />
<br />
However, your other point is very valid. The current system that changes white to yellow reducing from a 17% miss chance to a certain hit (with enough hit rating) is certainly something we will lose out on. Of course, right now when we do that, we also don't get any rage back from those hits. <br />
<br />
I still like the concept because they can actually adjust the levels in beta depending on whether we're seeing ourselves becoming rage starved or whatever, but I do think that they'll have to do something to prevent every Fury warrior losing about 1-2K dps right off the bat to accommodate for not having this &quot;secondary&quot; global timer mechanic we're used to. To be fair, I'm willing to take the hit as long as it doesn't stay at the point that I was at before I geared up, where I was pulling so little dps that I had to beg just to get in the raids. Especially with the stiff enrages Blizz is loving so much these days that require 6.5K dps on average in 25's.</div></div><hr />

So you are saying they are planning a COMPLETE reworking of how Fury Warriors operate? This sounds like something MUCH different than advertised then. If this is the case, then it is way more than just rage management they are talking about. They did NOT discuss this yet, and if this is what they are thinking, then they need to talk about it.<br />
<br />
If they plan on greatly altering the way main hand swings will land, we are talking about a 20%~ loss in damage. BT-WW-(1 sec delay)-BT-Free-Free is fairly typical rotation Fury rotation. The way swings would line up would be with each of the attacks so (Swing-BT-Swing-WW-Swing-BT-Swing-Swing-Free-Swing-Free. All this change is looking like is filling the Free swings with this new &quot;HS&quot; which looks exactly like Execute.<br />
<br />
Unless this new Heroic Strike/Cleave operates separately from the typical GCD, or the GCD is greatly reduced, you might as well throw away most of the other useful tools a fury warrior can do. No more place to add sunder, shout, or demo shout. No more chances for stance dances. You either totally break your rotation and have far too much rage, or you simply don't cast HS for one of your new moves.<br />
<br />
I'm very leery of these changes, trying to insert more necessary GCDs into a class that already is GCD starved is just asking for huge problems. On top of the potentially huge DPS loss from changing main hand swings to white swings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember DK tanking being braindead in 3.1 (I think 3.1 ... whichever patch before the start of the DK tank nerfs). Now I have to think more and rotate my abilities a bit more intelligently or I end up with no resources available and I just stand there and get kicked in the nuts until the cooldowns are up. I'm not saying that DK tanking is tough, but there is a huge difference between DK tanking pre-3.2 and DK tanking now.<br />

It is also nice for warriors and druids not being penalized rage-wise for overgearing an instance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand all of the comments to this effect. It's like saying Shield Slam is the same as Bloodthirst because they're both offensive abilities that cost 20 rage and are instant cast.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is just taking the rage dump implementation of an ability and applying it to more abilities than just Execute. You know zero about how the abilities themselves are going to be implemented, how each is affected by talents, glyphs, etc. to make them behave differently.<br />
<br />
Every single ability that takes a set amount of rage to fire off is equivalent according to the poor reasoning being thrown around here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And once again, do you really think there is any chance that this hasn't occurred to them yet? <br />
And in case you missed it, every talent tree is getting a major overhaul, and talent trees are a large source of the style and nature of a spec. Ergo, every class is getting a major overhaul. I understand your concerns, but just wait for the beta and see what they're doing. <br />
<br />
Also: depending on just how much damage heroic strike does, it's possible that as high threat ability, it might cause you to pull aggro. I can't say I'd be entirely surprised, given the nature of the change's that they're already making, to see high threat abilities changed so that non-tanks are discouraged from using them at the risk of pulling aggro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeddek</div><div class="date">2010-04-05, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These changes tend to worry me when looking at the current way fury warriors are set up. We currently need 5% (4% if alliance) hit for the &quot;cap&quot;, and with this it will increase that to 17% (as someone has already stated). Now, if they go through and fix this with talents, or change how titan grip works with duel wielding, that could fix the hit problem. <br />
<br />
The other problem I see is how a fury warrior uses GCD. Currently a fury warrior uses HS during every swing, and basically uses up every single GCD for either BT, WW or Slam (among a few other things). With this current system, the fury warrior will lose rage much easier. From what i hear, it sounds more like an Energy-ish system then the current rage system. For those who have played a rogue, many times you are sitting, waiting for your energy to recover so you can use another attack. But to compensate, those attacks do more burst, and rogue's melee damage is a great portion of the overall damage done. <br />
<br />
When looking at the fury warrior, currently our hardest hitting Ability is BT (normally hitting around 15-20k). WW and slam do around 12-15k hits. These hits happen every time they are off CD, because we have infinite rage (along with HS going on, which is actually the majority of our damage). If we are finding ourselves waiting for our rage to recover (waiting for next white hit to connect), wouldnt that greatly decrease our damage? With the current system, we need to attack as often as possible, and going rage starved for even 1-2 GCD is a great dps decrease. I could see having to wait for rage more often with this new system totally killing Fury if something isnt changed with how the fury warrior is played. Changing BT, WW, or Slam's burst might fix it, but i dont think they'll want to change fury into a Burst class.<br />
<br />
Am I thinking too much into this? I know I dont have hard numbers and such, but this seems to me like it could pose a problem if the Fury warrior isnt greatly changed. <br />
<br />
oh, and this wasnt strongly thought out and is more a &quot;first response&quot; type post, so please, no flaming ;D<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Also, this isn't a QQ post. I don't hate the changes, they just make me nervous. I could see them balancing it by changes Titan grip so they hit is less on fury, and by making it so the damage is more bursty, or some other addition. It just makes me nervous, because I enjoy my warrior alot, and this change looks like it's going to almost completely change how warriors are played, and I'm hoping ill still enjoy my warrior after this change takes place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Every Auto-attack will generate rage. This is no longer based on damage and thus not gear dependent. It will be dependent on the speed of the weapon and that will be normalized - think flametongue from shamans.<br />
<br />
1.0 speed weapons generate 10 rage every auto-attack swing.<br />
2.0 speed weapons generate 20 rage every auto-attack swing.<br />
3.0 speed weapons generate 30 rage every auto-attack swing.<br />
4.0 speed weapons generate 40 rage every auto-attack swing.<br />
<br />
2) Haste effects rage due to increasing the speed that you auto-attack and thus gain rage. Think of this like flametongue for shamans again - you will most likely want the slowest weapons possible to gain the most rage from haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Crits will cause double rage gen.<br />
<br />
<br />
4) All hits done to you will cause rage generation depending on your max health. This means you will gain more rage with higher your max health, it doesn't matter if the attack lands at all. This would make warrior tanks none rage-starved at higher gear levels from avioding too many hits.<br />
<br />
This normalization might work better since they are doing it at the start of the expansion instead of in the middle.</div></div><hr />

i dont like this change, i just dont like it and im afraid of it.<br />
so, we are loosing heroic strike, which is currently 25-3x% of our dmg. i admit spamming HS was/is stupid, boring, smashing a keyboard (1 button) constantly for 4 hours of raid was and still is devastating for it...<br />
BUT if they want to remove it then what about our overall dmg? we will be left with BT, WW, Bloodsurge? lol? really? i mean, reaaaaally? /wave my warrior hi my enh shaman/rogue.<br />
even if, theoretically, we would have enough rage to spam bt,ww,slams whenever they are up, we dont have enought gcd to fill heroic strike in. for example: bt - ww - slam - bt - free(yeee heroic strike!) - bt - slam - ww -bt ... oh, hi sunder armor. oh, hi battle shout, oh, hi commanding shout, hi berserker rage... or should i say, goodbye because i dont have the time to use it.<br />
<br />
the point is, we dont have the chance of actually using heroic strike to a point where our dmg becomes competitive.<br />
the only options are: improving talents to improve our dmg by x% (improving unending fury, removing the penalty on titans grip), or making the new heroic strike not only an instant attack, BUT also a GCD free attack. does it sounds op? no. we wont have rage for it, unless they wont destroy the rage mechanic that much.<br />

im more of a traditionalist and a realist...</div></div><hr />

i dont like this change, i just dont like it and im afraid of it.<br />
so, we are loosing heroic strike, which is currently 25-3x% of our dmg. i admit spamming HS was/is stupid, boring, smashing a keyboard (1 button) constantly for 4 hours of raid was and still is devastating for it...<br />
BUT if they want to remove it then what about our overall dmg? we will be left with BT, WW, Bloodsurge? lol? really? i mean, reaaaaally? /wave my warrior hi my enh shaman/rogue.<br />
even if, theoretically, we would have enough rage to spam bt,ww,slams whenever they are up, we dont have enought gcd to fill heroic strike in. for example: bt - ww - slam - bt - free(yeee heroic strike!) - bt - slam - ww -bt ... oh, hi sunder armor. oh, hi battle shout, oh, hi commanding shout, hi berserker rage... or should i say, goodbye because i dont have the time to use it.<br />
<br />
the point is, we dont have the chance of actually using heroic strike to a point where our dmg becomes competitive.<br />
the only options are: improving talents to improve our dmg by x% (improving unending fury, removing the penalty on titans grip), or making the new heroic strike not only an instant attack, BUT also a GCD free attack. does it sounds op? no. we wont have rage for it, unless they wont destroy the rage mechanic that much.<br />
<br />
im more of a traditionalist and a realist...<br />
<br />
<br />
Whoa! simmer down there chief. Did you read the post or just the replies?<br />
<br />
4) All “on next swing” attacks in Cataclysm are being removed. Heroic Strike and Maul will be instant swings that cost a variable amount of Rage. For example, imagine Heroic Strike costs between 10 and 30 Rage. You must have at least 10 Rage to use the attack, but it will consume all available Rage up to a maximum of 30. Any Rage consumed above the minimum will cause the ability to hit harder, and in some cases much harder. We will tune the ability so that it’s generally not a good idea to hit it when you have low Rage (unless everything else is somehow on cooldown) but becomes a more attractive button the higher your Rage.<br />
<br />
So no HS isn't going anywhere it's just gonna be different now. <br />
<br />
I thought I was a reactionary. Let's not burn the house down just yet.</div></div><hr />

the new heroic strike will be an instant and will now, most likely, require a GCD(the current heroic strike doesnt, just to let you know). so we will barely have the time to use heroic strike(assuming we have rage) which will be only a filler in the rotation, and we will be loosing hell alot of our main hand real overall damage.</div></div><hr />

The rage normalization isn't exactly encouraging, but then it pretty much sucks the way it is now too...so meh. I'll reserve my opinion for more details.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) The HS change is stupid, plain and simple. Requires 10 rage, consumes up to 30 for extra damage? Thats an improved execute without the 20% hp restriction. At lower levels of gear, its will be inferior to execute, but once you get decent its damage willl outshine execute's. Also, no point in having 2 similar skills with only damage as a difference in the same class.<br />
<br />
2) The main problem with rage is how it scales with gear: once we get hit caped, we hit more often and get more rage. Same with expertise. More crit rating = more critical strikes = more rage. Since low geared warriors have low hit/expertise/crit, their rage generation and also damage is terrible. This &quot;normalization&quot; apparently is ignoring all that; rage should be generated even on miss/dodge/parries, that way a t7 warrior would generate almost as much rage as a t10 one (t10 would generate more since it will crit more often).<br />
<br />
3) The system is called &quot;rage&quot;. I would &quot;rage&quot; if i try to hit an enemy and it would miss/dodge/parry my attack. Giving some extra rage to that would help balancing low-geared warriors.<br />
<br />
4) I once saw in a blue post that they were unhappy about having no benefit in having a full rage bar (since the execute nerf). Makes sense, after all, if I'm full raged, I should hit harder (*free advice here blizzard), this would force warriors to admin their rage since having less rage = less damage. However, i didnt see anything in this &quot;normalization&quot; regarding this issue.<br />
<br />
Come on, its been 5 years and the rage system (aka the core of the warrior class) is still broken, and that second &quot;normalization&quot; is the best they can do? For real, hire me and I will fix your game for you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jorkku</div><div class="date">2010-04-05, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK tell me how you can tell it is nice change if you dont the cd of the new hs or will it be mixed up with BT and ww cds? Think if you can swing the hs now 2-3 times before next cycles starts again every swing does approx lets say avg 10k crit and 5k hit, if you do the little math 2x10k+5k you get 25k. So after this change you can prolly swing 1 heroic strike(assuming cd is like 3 sec maybe more) so lets say the change would come to live NOW: the one heroic strike have to hit atleast 25k in one strike to beat the old mechanic(next swing). Lets say bloodhthirst crits now approx 14k and hits 6k. So imagine why would they change heroic strike so overpowered that it will be almost double up better than bloodthirst. I repeat imagine the new heroic strike mechanic would come to live now and how good it has to be to beat the old mechanic. <br />
<br />
Another points 1. it will be basically the same because if you crit now you will get 100rage immediately so this &quot;the attack is a critical strike, it will generate 200% Rage&quot; doesnt change anything and 2. oh wait &quot;Haste will accelerate swing times to generate Rage faster&quot; doesnt this sound like old mechanic, if you hit more you get more rage(it also means you can hit more big strikes where the rage is practically generated nowadays). So the post doesnt really say anything positive yet maybe they straight it up in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is what they are doing basicly. You no longer gain rage based on damage done but you gain rage on every auto-attack, even if it misseds from what I understand.<br />
<br />

Sure your five percent to hit worked for you for THIS WHOLE EXPANSION PACK, but in Cataclysm, you're going to be looking at stacking more and more hit anyway, point is:<br />
<br />
A LOT OF THINGS ARE CHANGING, YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE WHOLE PICTURE, STOP BEING SO FRIGGING SHORT SIGHTED!<br />
<br />
Imagine how useful this will be for leveling up warriors as well, having a real ability @ level one? Gtfo!<br />
<br />
But seriously, like many others have said, you don't know what else is being changed, if you apply the current known changes into the current system, some things just would not work, i.e., shamans having zero intellect for enhancement, you would OOM a lot faster than your Shamanistic Rage cooldown could keep up with, so obvi something is being changed else where.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Haste still sucks as always cause again if you crit you get the primary rage like nowadays so crit will overpower haste in this rage issue and ofc like now gemming crit in best icc gear is almost the same as gemming str so in Cataclysm when you &quot;dont have the rage issues&quot; gemming strenght getting even better. And if the intent is to just remove rage starvation why they even want to do it by lowering the value of the other stat? someone might call this nerfing. And if they want to get rid off rage loss they arent really changing the mechanic if they just doing another stat better for getting rage than another, now it has been str/crit and next it will be crit/haste like they posted. Change the mechanic not the input where the rage is gained. Period.</div></div><hr />

Ghostcrawler said somewhere that they will base these skills not on the globlal cooldown. He said it somewhere in one of the recent warrior discussions.<br />

<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Client Patch &quot;Before the Storm&quot; (12/5/2006) (a.k.a. 2.0)<br />
<br />
Warriors<br />
-Rage generation from dealing damage has been normalized.<br />
All Rage awards are averaged with our expected rage per swing (adjusted for weapon speed).<br />
<br />
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Client Patch 2.0.10 (03/6/2007)<br />
<br />
Warriors<br />
-The rage normalization equation has been adjusted to grant more rage. The typical warrior should see an increase of 15% to 20% in their rage generation.<br />
<br />
Three months to fix it, from the time it was released to live. Not to mention it was already broken in TBC Beta, and they ignored it. How much happens in your guild in three months? How much progression does your guild make in three months? That's the only thing that worries me when Blizzard makes these statements of, &quot;We'll fix it quickly if it isn't working right.&quot; History says otherwise.<br />
<br />
This doesn't mean that the new angle they're taking will necessarily be bad, it may turn out to be quite amazing. (I certainly fall under the category of old timers with apprehension, since I remember the worst of times and how long it took them to finally fix it.) I just think there could be better solutions to help warriors be functional at all levels of play, without resorting to gimmicks that turn rage into something more akin to &quot;energy&quot; than rage.</div></div><hr />

You have to know there will be more changes. You are trying to apply the changes to HS to what we do NOW. We aren't gonna do it that way in the future you can be sure of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of you QQing about implementing these changes into present rotations/priorities are seriously short-sighted retards. But you've all been flamed already by some other people with some kind of sense already, so i'll just leave it.<br />
<br />
The changes to shouts are really exciting, imo. I'm an arms warrior through and through, and when i respec to fury to play around, one of my favorite changes was how much rage you could get from abilities, like berserker rage. Definitely made me feel more in control.<br />
<br />
This is exciting. A week ago, i would've been one of the few opposed to removing next-swing abilities, but i can see how this could bring balance to warrior dps compared to other classes... it probably makes scaling way easier for blizzard. Lastly, rage changes should be fun too. i foresee way less time worrying about rage, and much more time thinking about it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quez</div><div class="date">2010-04-05, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, i read it. <br />
and did you read what ive wrote?<br />
<br />
the new heroic strike will be an instant and will now, most likely, require a GCD(the current heroic strike doesnt, just to let you know). so we will barely have the time to use heroic strike(assuming we have rage) which will be only a filler in the rotation, and we will be loosing hell alot of our main hand real overall damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you seriously think that blizzard won't compensate for the massive dps Heroic strike was accounted for? Really?<br />
Warriors will not fall behind, not for long at least.<br />
<br />
I'm really exited about these changes, one of the reasons why I quit raiding on my fury warrior a month back was because it was so damn boring doing that ez-mode rotation.<br />
<br />
Now with another low-cd ability doing damage depending on rage will affect the fury warrior prio list a lot, thinking ahead like:<br />
&quot;After this gcd I will cast WW, leaving a x sec window for next BT with 30 rage remaining, HS is coming off 2 secs earlier then BT, shall I use HS right away? Will any autoswings go off before BT so it doesn't get delayed? Or should I use HS after BT to ensure that it won't get delayed?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I were to design a rage dump ability, I'd make it something like 200% weapon damage for 60 rage. (Using Fury/Arms numbers as an example. Prot numbers would differ due to talents, of course.)<br />
<br />
It would cost a shitload, so that you couldn't use it very often; but it would certainly be worth the button press and the GCD at times when you are in abundance of rage. <br />
<br />
I doubt Blizzard will make something much different. It will follow the model of hitting a fair bit harder than other abilities of the spec, but with a significantly higher rage cost.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodcore</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has fail all over it:<br />
<br />
1) The HS change is stupid, plain and simple. Requires 10 rage, consumes up to 30 for extra damage? Thats an improved execute without the 20% hp restriction. At lower levels of gear, its will be inferior to execute, but once you get decent its damage willl outshine execute's. Also, no point in having 2 similar skills with only damage as a difference in the same class.<br />
<br />
2) The main problem with rage is how it scales with gear: once we get hit caped, we hit more often and get more rage. Same with expertise. More crit rating = more critical strikes = more rage. Since low geared warriors have low hit/expertise/crit, their rage generation and also damage is terrible. This &quot;normalization&quot; apparently is ignoring all that; rage should be generated even on miss/dodge/parries, that way a t7 warrior would generate almost as much rage as a t10 one (t10 would generate more since it will crit more often).<br />
<br />
3) The system is called &quot;rage&quot;. I would &quot;rage&quot; if i try to hit an enemy and it would miss/dodge/parry my attack. Giving some extra rage to that would help balancing low-geared warriors.<br />
<br />
4) I once saw in a blue post that they were unhappy about having no benefit in having a full rage bar (since the execute nerf). Makes sense, after all, if I'm full raged, I should hit harder (*free advice here blizzard), this would force warriors to admin their rage since having less rage = less damage. However, i didnt see anything in this &quot;normalization&quot; regarding this issue.<br />
<br />
Come on, its been 5 years and the rage system (aka the core of the warrior class) is still broken, and that second &quot;normalization&quot; is the best they can do? For real, hire me and I will fix your game for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurel</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i play my fury warrior for quite a few years already and i am somewhat used to the how-the-warrior works idea.<br />
i dont like this change, i just dont like it and im afraid of it.<br />
so, we are loosing heroic strike, which is currently 25-3x% of our dmg. i admit spamming HS was/is stupid, boring, smashing a keyboard (1 button) constantly for 4 hours of raid was and still is devastating for it...<br />
BUT if they want to remove it then what about our overall dmg? we will be left with BT, WW, Bloodsurge? lol? really? i mean, reaaaaally? /wave my warrior hi my enh shaman/rogue.<br />
even if, theoretically, we would have enough rage to spam bt,ww,slams whenever they are up, we dont have enought gcd to fill heroic strike in. for example: bt - ww - slam - bt - free(yeee heroic strike!) - bt - slam - ww -bt ... oh, hi sunder armor. oh, hi battle shout, oh, hi commanding shout, hi berserker rage... or should i say, goodbye because i dont have the time to use it.<br />
<br />
the point is, we dont have the chance of actually using heroic strike to a point where our dmg becomes competitive.<br />
the only options are: improving talents to improve our dmg by x% (improving unending fury, removing the penalty on titans grip), or making the new heroic strike not only an instant attack, BUT also a GCD free attack. does it sounds op? no. we wont have rage for it, unless they wont destroy the rage mechanic that much.<br />
<br />
im more of a traditionalist and a realist...<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm concerned myself, but there are easy fixes to a few of the things you mentioned.<br />
<br />
1. All the shouts will generate rage, and be on an extended cooldown, so they won't necessarily be on the GCD, (also eliminating the need for Blood rage/berserker rage). Sunder Armor...lessee how to work that in? Hey we could make it a next swing ability! lmao<br />
<br />
2. They could change the hit penalty for DW to 4% mainhand, 17% offhand to compensate for taking HS off of next swing ability<br />
<br />
Making HS work like execute sounds kinda dumb when we already have execute, but we'll see how they work that out.<br />
<br />
Hopefully we won't see a PvE nerf because PvP warrs are generating uber-rage with their larger health pools and then spamming 30rage HS bursts! ;D</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but what the hell is your point?<br />
<br />
Currently tanks get rage for hitting and being hit, and they still will. It's just that their rage for hitting will not go up as they get better gear and their rage from being hit will not go down as they get better gear.<br />
<br />
As a fury/arms war, you will get a consistent amount of rage regardless of your gear.</div></div><hr />

Yup, Warriors will be Rogues with no combo points (a.k.a. Hunters with Focus) that start a fight at 0 Energy.<br />

I personally believe this &quot;normalization&quot; is a new way of energy but starting from zero. Everything has a set value, nothing to determine a change. This = this much rage, this = that much rage. It's so basic, rage to me is the core of the warrior class. When I get rage my character should be pumped, like a baseball player on steroids, just going all out banana insane on the target. Like a no remorse enrage. A full rage bar to me means, I am pissed the F*** off. My solution to the rage problem, the higher your rage bar is the more damage you do. A full rage bar means you get a % modifier on your dmg. A low rage bar means your at basic damage. Sort of like hunter pets. You feed them, at yellow happy face they do their normal dmg. At green, they do 50% more damage. So a full rage bar or above 0 rage means more damage. So warriors who dps will be forced to manage their rage by having a good amount of it to get the % bonus to their abilities, without running out and not getting a bonus to damage. So you'd have to time you abilities right to have alot of rage whenyou use them to get a nice damage boost to them. For low levels who get parried/miss/dodge alot of their attacks. If I was a warrior and some worm in rfc dodged my slash. I'd get pissed off and be like. &quot;OMGWTFBBQ, worm cant dodge a knife, im MADDDD!!! RAWR!&quot; So imo dodges,parries,misses should give some amount of rage. So if a mob dodges your heroic strike you are refunded a % of that rage that it cost or w/e. Or it just generates 5-10 rage. Another idea, is that at a full rage bar or 75 rage + or situations where u have infinite rage moments, you should be able to hit some short CD ability that puts u in a nutjob maniac mode and u get a huge dmg bonus. This drains 60+ rage and you lose more constantly as the buff persists but your abilities are going to hit a hell of a lot harder. That way you have to manage using the CD in conjunction with your abilities so you dont just waste rage and not have any more rage to use abilities. When instead you could have used that rage on abilities and done more dmg than with just white hits with a dmg buff. These are just stupid ideas that came to the top of my head. Sorry for the wall of text. I just feel blizz took the easy way out on this problem. Yes it sounds good on paper, and yes it fixes alot of problems, but it seems to take away the core feeling of the class and make it feel like some sort of rogue/hunter where you just keep refilling your rage and theres no trivial rng to get crit or get a crit on a mob to give you more rage to use.</div></div><hr />

There a a freaky high number of warriors in wow that want to get into raids and hero inis as tanks. <br />
There are many reasons why but they have no clue how to tank. <br />
On the other side there are so many dps plyers which will never learn that you have to wait for aggro. Look at Aggro...pay attention.<br />
<br />
Rage for a tank is all about Aggro generation. Change HS ist a good solution. Make Devaste a dot like Hit like Bleed, Blocking attacks with reflect damage on the attacker, Add more aggro the protection.....<br />

<br />
I am skeptical of change but I will withhold outrage until I see something more concrete.<br />
<br />
They should completely rework the rage system instead of making it a rogue/dk hybrid. Been mentioned before in various threads, but having rage affect damage output of skills instead of usability of skills would make playing a warrior truly unique. QQ normalization.</div></div><hr />

They just told about the BASIC changes for rage. They didn't say a word how your talenttree / skills affect the rage being generated.<br />
<br />
So the basic rage will be normalized and be a way easier to change / balance if there are some flaws or problems. Nothing like today, where a simple change could make the class loose massivly or getting op in an instant.<br />
<br />
I guess every talenttree will have his own, unique skills which give some kind of bonus rage - and I don't see what could be bad about something like a chain combo of certain skills to get out the max. of dmg. Way more interesting playstyle.</div></div><hr />

No they shouldn't?<br />
<br />
This new model is amazing. If you don't like it, it's because you don't understand it yet, which is fine. I'm telling you though, this is the best thing to happen to rage ever. No longer warriors not caring about their rage or not having enough.<br />
<br />
The new Heroic Strike is awesome too. Makes you think about your rage before you hit it. If you have 30 rage it will use it all, if you have 10 rage it will use it all.<br />
<br />
Great stuff, warrior game play is about to get so much better.</div></div><hr />
