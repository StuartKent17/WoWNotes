Exorsus - Mythic Helya Statement<br />
Exorsus posted a statement on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/5ei76r/statement_about_helya_situation_and_some_other/) today about their Mythic Helya kill.<br />
Helya situation<br />
To make sure everyone fully understands what's happened, i will try to explain it as simple as it could be. Helya has a &quot;Breath&quot; ability, which deals cone damage + spawns adds on 1st phase and void zones on 2nd phase, that should be soaked. Our guild found out, that if you're killing your tank on 1st phase, Breath is stopping, so using shamans talent &quot;Ancestral Protection Totem&quot; to kill your tank effectively gives you more damage on 1st phase without any negative consequence. At that point we never knew how it works on last phase, however we've been pretty confident that we can avoid this breath the same way on the last phase.<br />
<br />
Before starting to discuss everything else, I'm pretty sure some of you will ask - why would you do this?! It's an exploit by itself, you're killing tank to avoid mechanics. The answer is no, that was the strategy everyone been using on Archimonde (avoiding the crystal via tank death) and even Blizzard themselves are ok with this part.<br />
<br />
So the real deal comes to the last phase, because for some reason after you're avoiding first breath, she simply stops casting it. It's an obvious bug (that has been reported by some guilds on a heroic week), that makes encounter easier (not even close to trivial, if you ask me). So at this point we had 2 options - completely scrap the strategy and start inventing new one or stick to this strategy, considering it's still a solid one, because even without this bug it's a valid strategy (because if Blizzard fixed a bug, that Helya stops breath we still can kill our tanks to avoid the same ability, simply by ressing them via combat resses or via shaman's totem). I guess you already know which strategy we've chosen after all.<br />
<br />
Talking about consistency - ALL last bosses in last 3 raid contents had some &quot;tricks&quot; to make them easier, on some bosses even totally trivializing last phase: 1) You were able to use Monk tank on last phase of Blackhand to completely avoid his smashes - top 4 and top 5 guilds both used it (and even published a video) - yet no consequences. 2) On Mythic Archimonde you were able to kill your tank to avoid Crystal on last phase, helping with dps requirement on the fight. Every guild in top 5 (or even 10, most likely) used it. Again, no consequences.<br />
<br />
So now comes the last part of 1st paragraph - our kill log. In case some people are wondering is this legit kill or not (or if the boss is trivial with this &quot;exploit&quot; or not) - when boss died we had 3 combat ressurections available + totem (more than enough to cover all the breaths without any bug on the encounter). Once again - i'm 100% sure it will not change anything, so it's more of a thing for community to take a look at:<br />
<br />
https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/VynvfKX7HtmqGpZ2<br />
<br />
Now let's move to some other paragraphs.<br />
<br />
Legendaries<br />
I'm 100% sure this is something that almost every WoW player currently experiencing, so want to brought up some of the main issues with them, because they're making only more frustration to MAJORITY of the playerbase:<br />
<br />
1) Design itself - currently we have utility vs dps legendaries. For almost any situation you want to bring dps/hps legendary, making utility legendaries totally unwanted. And even dps/hps legendaries now are not always something everyone wants, because it may be slight to none in dps gain, due to bad design. Solution to this problem is simple - all legendaries should only be utility ones, making them something you want to get for some new capabilities, but not making you always win/loose on dps meter.<br />
<br />
2) &quot;4 legendaries softcap&quot;. I know that Devs stated more than once that there's none such a thing like &quot;softcap&quot;, but it's definitely currently in game. For sure, there are persons with 5 (or even 8) legendaries, howeve i assume most of them due to early bug, that helped you to get many legendaries if you got your 1st one at the start of the expansion. In fact, even the guy (or guys) who made 1340 M+ dungeons on his character still has 4 legendaries, which is more than enough of a proof. Currently, such softcap leads to some totally idiotic things, raiders (including mine) are forced to do. Got 4 legendaries on your class and they're all terrible? Got 4 legendaries for &quot;Fire&quot; spec and now it's useless, so you need Arcane ones? Missing one that is crucial for your gameplay?<br />
<br />
The answer to ALL of those questions is simple - go on and create new character, level it to 110 and good luck this time. That's the ONLY choice right now for you, otherwise good luck with your useless ones.<br />
<br />
Solution to this issue is surprisingly easy: either let us exchange our 2-3 legendaries into a new one or just remove this softcap, which is just ingame for god knows why reason. Talking about Mythic raids - i would prefer if Blizzard completely disabled legendaries for 1st 2-3 weeks (making their enabling as a 1st meaningful nerf to the dungeon)<br />
<br />
&quot;Race coverage&quot;<br />
That's the next issue i want to brought up with all the community and Blizzard. Am i the only one, who's a bit upset about the fact, that best PvE MMO Ever has PvP tournament each year at Blizzcon, however no one cares about PvE at all? More on that, we even have M+ rankings on Blizzard side now, but still nothing about raid dungeons. Every time i'm checking official Warcraft twitter i can see reposts about someone beating &quot;Lil'idan&quot; petbattle with some fancy screenshot, but almost not a single mention about the PvE race at all.<br />
<br />
The sad thing is - PvE top scene is slowly dying. Remember the times when getting into top 10 of the world was something you dreamed of as a hardcore guild? Now it's more of a question if you have 20 people to stay online for 14+ hours for 1 week.<br />
<br />
Split raids are killing top guilds too. Progressing in Mythic difficulty is fun, but leveling 6 characters, farming legendaries, AP, gear on them to make 6 splitraids on heroic week is not. The reason such things still exists is understandable - heroic week is a &quot;1 more PTR test week&quot; for developers, where they can fix bugs, tune classes and so on, however from top guild perspective it's just terrible.<br />
<br />
Recruiting becomes almost impossible - it's hard to explain to any skilled player, why would he waste his time on this, when the only good outcome he gets is some cheering on twitter and some good emotions after the kill. The only thing that still attracts people to such guilds is &quot;boosting&quot; (and it's gonna be the last paragraph), because selling M+ and raid runs for a real life money helps every top guild to at least get some cash for what they do.<br />
<br />
And for all this situations i see only 2 variants (I'm not telling they're ideal ones, just my 2 cents):<br />
<br />
1) Introduce some kind of small prize pool for top N guilds in a world, making rules pretty straightforward (you need to kill the final boss, maximum X raiders per guild, etc), this changes will attract a tons of people back to hardcore scene, to WoW as a game and will give Blizzard additional media resources and advertisement. They can even introduce some kind of pets (for example a small version of every endboss in a raid dungeon), and sell them as a crowdfunding thing (5%/10%/20% of all payments are going to prize fund) for this prizepool. All of these thing are even making more sense, considering Blizzard is trying to expand into Cybersport industry in every single game right now (seen this cool Krusher video?). Why not to make it in most successful one?<br />
<br />
2) This variant helps if Blizzard definitely still don't want to care about PvE race as a thing. How about introducing totally new &quot;progress&quot; system? Rules are quite easy and simple - every guild streams their progress and the one that kills it 1st (2nd,3rd etc) on the stream gets the prize fund. With such variant attracting more sponsors for such progressions will be easy as a cake. And i'm 99% sure every top guild will agree on such terms.<br />
<br />
&quot;TOS Violation&quot;<br />
I've seen such popular statement from different fans and just forum posters on different websites. I'm pretty sure they don't really understand to what extent ANY top guilds violates ToS in fact. I just want to shed some light on how everything really works for a top guild:<br />
<br />
1) &quot;Small abuses&quot; - every top guild tries to maximize their character performance, so if they found a small bug, which helps you to get an advantage - they will use it 100%, unless it's a clear bad exploit. (examples in Legion - enabling raid group before withered scenario to get exalted with faction / enabling raid group for infinite gathering world quests / dueling in 5 man dungeons to get PvP talents working (hello DHT) / resetting insanity drain on Shadow Priests and many more).<br />
<br />
2) &quot;Account sharing&quot; - once again, if some guild needs 4 (insert class here) and their main roster has only 3 of this character or some guy has an alt / inactive guild players with better legendaries - they will just transfer him to new account with the same name and surname, and use him for progression for another player. If it's an inactive player account, they will just &quot;rent&quot; it for the progression. It's a common approach and every top guild uses it when they need it. (And yes, top guilds been using it even on last 2 contents with a bunch of examples)<br />
<br />
3) &quot;Boosting&quot; - as I've already stated in 3rd paragraph, every guild needs to attract and keep people by some ways, other that &quot;we're top guild, it's so fun to be on progress site top rankings&quot;. Because of that and the fact, that there are 0 tournaments or opportunities to somehow get any $ from top raiding (apart from streaming) every top guild is selling boosts for real life money. So by paying ~100-1000 USD/EUR you can get your piloted (yes, even with account sharing) / selfplay raid / Mythic+ run with a top guild. And if, for some reason, you're interested in buying something every week, you may even stay in this top guild (finding examples is not that hard simply by observing some &quot;strange&quot; raiders in wowprogress roster), to avoid confusion on the streams etc (however most of them anyway using addons, which replacing nicknames on raid frames and damage meters to avoid questions on streams). Once again, it's not something every guild is doing because they enjoy it, it simply a matter of surviving because of the fact, that &quot;PvE race&quot; is not something that by any means acknowledged by Blizzard. The sad part is, that a lot of guilds are now completely abandoned such thing as progression and just simply focusing themselves on boosting as many clients as possible.<br />
<br />
4) &quot;Raid abuses&quot; - such term as &quot;abuse of ingame mechanics&quot; is always a very creative thing from developers side to interpret. Sometimes a lot of things are simply ignored, sometimes we're being punished for them. Most of the time developers are even watching at top guild pulls during progression, and fixing some stuff over here and there. In the end of the day, every progression for a top guild is more of a situation, where they encounter a fight, that is simply tuned for ilvl, that is way higher than they have. And starting from this point we're trying to find different solutions how to heal/damage it through. Sometimes we're coming up with simple solutions like &quot;let's just try it with 3 healers&quot;, sometimes it's &quot;let's keep the dragons away, because this way we can avoid killing dragons&quot;, sometimes it's &quot;let's kill our tank on crystal / breath, to avoid killing this add, because we're lacking of DPS&quot;. In that case it's always been like that and nothing will change in a future, unless something drastically changes.<br />
<br />
Hope some of those words will explain a lot of rumors about top raiding and probably even some Blizzard guys will read this and probably this will change something.<br />
<br />
Other than than i still want to say thanks to Blizzard and add that from casual player perspective Legion looks like the most successful expansion ever, due to tons of things to do and some really good timing with adding new content over time. However i do hope they can show some love to dedicated players of their game too.<br />

<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
What are your thoughts on the pros and cons of the DPS/Tank/Healer triad? Should games keep that or should it be scrapped? Do you think that MMOs could benefit from the composition of teams and combat styles we see in MOBAs?<br />
Man, this could be an entire book.<br />
<br />
I think the biggest pro is that DPS/tank/healer generally works and it’s something players understand by this point.<br />
<br />
I think the cons are that it’s a bit tired (though I think devs are more tired of it than players are), that setting up any system of “you must have X types” makes group-building harder, and it doesn’t mesh well with other systems. By that last bit, I mean that if you’re going to have a healer, it’s hard to come up with another leg in that stool that is as capable as the healer (say a “controller” or whatever) because nothing is as useful at a base level as unwinding damage. This is why we really only have one healer in League, Soraka, and she’s a pain in the ass to balance.<br />
<br />
I will argue that tank/DPS/healer doesn’t scale very well. What I mean by that is that if you have a game with character progression, the player expectation is that the tank gets more tanky, the DPS does more damage, and so on over time or successes or both. But if the tank starts out 30% more tanky than the DPS and becomes 200% more tanky than the DPS, then you move the two roles farther and farther apart the more progressed the characters can get. Maybe this means your DPS can tank a little at low progression but gets one-shot at higher progression. Maybe this means the suggestion of having three roles becomes more mandatory the higher you get. (D&amp;D for example has all three roles, but generally doesn’t mandate that you use them all, except possibly for 4th edition, because your group can scale the character progression and difficulty however they want.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The idea of building a new first person engine for something unannounced is interesting. I'm assuming this means they couldn't adapt the Overwatch engine, which drops a wide assortment of game styles from contention for what it is. Although, it could still be those and the engine just didn't do what they wanted. Just speculating,</div></div><hr />

Carrot on a stick. Blizzards main problem with wow is people playing the hell out of it, burning the content faster than they can or at least want to create it and then quit. But what if you couldn't because it is capped? Then you would keep playing ofc chasing a carrot that is a non shit legendary you can't possibly catch. By that logic blizz would also never tell you the soft cap is real, since you would just quit when you get whatever number it is and realise there is nothing left for you until they raise it again.<br />
<br />
But its kinda tin foil hatty to even suggest it, and they could make it possible to get 5 but just insanely rare (even more than legendaries under the cap are) so a few people would pop up on the armory and &quot;debunk&quot; the theory in its entirety. So super smart move honestly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Makes sense though, the strategy would have worked and it only caused an &quot;exploit&quot; because the fight was broken. So the fight being broken meant that they had to change their perfectly valid strategy purely to avoid exploiting a broken mechanic. Ultimately if the fight was not buggy their strategy is perfectly valid.<br />
<br />
Also, you have to take into consideration that Blizzard is selective with which bugs they ban over, in every tier there have been bosses where many guilds killed those bosses with the help of &quot;clever use of mechanics&quot; or outright exploits and Blizzard didn't do a damn thing, some of those situations even became the mainstream strategy for the fight.<br />
<br />
So if you're in a competitive environment you have to make a choice, they made the choice to continue with this strategy and it didn't pay off, but there was a very equal chance based on history that it could have paid off, or even that they could have used a different strategy (to avoid triggering the bug) and then lost the race to someone who did exploit the bug and got away with it.<br />
<br />
It is ultimately Blizzards fault for having a situation where a valid strategy causes a bug with the fight.. If Blizzard had been consistent with exploit bans in the past then nobody would exploit bugs, but since Blizzard are very inconsistent you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.<br />

exorsus admitting to RL Money Boosting should net them a perma Ban<br />

Hopefully it will be eye opening for blinded white knights out there pretending Boosting for real cash / systematic abuse of mechanics are not a thing in wow top guilds. The boosting thing is the real cancer of the game right now imo. The number of brats pretending to be PVE heroes because of high ilvl, achiev or mounts while spitting on casuals to feel better about themselves when they get carried all the way by real money is insane.<br />
<br />
I wish sponsored race with Blizzard was a thing, so that you guys could finance yourself properly without spoiling wannabes. The thing is, even if one could be a pro raider, what would stop top guilds to continue selling boosts for extra cash every week?</div></div><hr />

But he does have a point about legendaries. ALL of them should be utility ones, I have good 2 legendaries on my resto druid and I consistently do more healing than the other resto druid in my guild who is just as skilled as me and has 10 ilvls more than me but only 1 shit legendary.

Don't know why are you so salty. Method does it, Midwinter does it, Envy did it. You have to work part time or take time of your job if you want to raid in the top 10. Paying the bills gets way harder. Blizzard knows about this, they just can't prove it and don't care about it. They never did anything to anyone who used those exploits no matter top guild or not, so again it's not cheating if the allow it.</div></div><hr />

Carrot on a stick. Blizzards main problem with wow is people playing the hell out of it, burning the content faster than they can or at least want to create it and then quit. But what if you couldn't because it is capped? Then you would keep playing ofc chasing a carrot that is a non shit legendary you can't possibly catch. By that logic blizz would also never tell you the soft cap is real, since you would just quit when you get whatever number it is and realise there is nothing left for you until they raise it again.<br />
<br />
But its kinda tin foil hatty to even suggest it, and they could make it possible to get 5 but just insanely rare (even more than legendaries under the cap are) so a few people would pop up on the armory and &quot;debunk&quot; the theory in its entirety. So super smart move honestly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Obvious reason&quot;? What, to makes sure that your character is ruined after you get 4 and it's not the ones you need?<br />

<br />
As for his point on competitive raiding I think Blizz can do it but they'd need to build it from the ground up.<br />
<br />
1) Normalized raid templates. The raid will not drop gear and you go in with the same stats every time. You go into a mythic raid and you pick your talents but your artifact is set to a specific level with all traits unlocked and specific relics and all your gear is set to a specific level for very specific stats. <br />
<br />
Don't like your stats? <br />
<br />
Tough. <br />
<br />
2) Native viewing of the raid. Make one of those floating invisible NPCs that Blizz was talking about just a bit ago, they don't need to let you view what abilities are being used but you can follow every single thing going on. There will be a 10s lag between stream and raid so that you don't end up with the stream watching raid leader that's not participating, so no coaching you have to be in the game. Stream revenues are determined by the success of each stream. <br />
<br />
Do those two things and then PvE as a competitive &quot;sport&quot; suddenly becomes possible. It'll be all about skill - though yes there will be a lot of class stacking - it also removes the truly high end raiding from the rest of the game. Though there should be rewards of gear, pets, transmog and the like rewarded after the run ends. This also makes it so if anything goes nutty on a run - like Helya stopping her breaths - you can then shut down the raid immediately. <br />
<br />
Legendaries are more of the same old salt. They are one of those weird things that just doesn't matter until they do. The biggest issue with them though isn't getting a utility legendary though it's getting a legendary with poorly optimized stats, they'd be better off just letting you choose your stats somehow on the rings and necks or at the very least give them an even rank of each stat.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GrieverXIII</div><div class="date">2016-11-24, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course you have absolutely no grasp what the race is like at that level.

<br />
<br />
There's nothing level headed about it. They use straw man fallacies to justify cheating and breaking the Terms of Services of the game they are so &quot;dedicated&quot; to then ask Blizzard to turn it into something that its not: a way to make a proper living.<br />
<br />
Its like they're finally waking up and realize their situation isn't sustainable. Denial is always the first step. Maybe in a few years they will also be casual &quot;scrubs&quot; who dare play this shit for fun, just to unwind after working their 40s.</div></div><hr />

When mythic releases there are always thousands of people watching raiders from top guilds progressing through the raid for several hours. The number of people watching could be greatly improved if blizzard adivertised the race and put a money price for the winner.<br />

Except that he wasn't even referring to boosting as the cause of the ban but as to what they have to do to be able to keep people interested and able to raid at that level.

It was tested. The thing is you can't test for every single possible scenario. It was working as intended and then they found a loophole. Not everything is bug free.

I wonder, how good would those top guilds be if they were locked to one character to raid with? I mean better than me and probably better than most of us here, and ofc they do have time to gear up loads of character and use the best one for the raid. But if they competed with similar terms as we &quot;normals&quot; do, would it then take alot longer to get first kills? With a week? 2? 1 month?<br />
<br />
For those bugs in raids etc, its been like this for 12 freakin years, don't fool yourself and think that this is something new cause they are now suddenly rushing things. One reason might be that they always rushed it :P<br />

<br />
You realize that for a &quot;small&quot; prize pool to feel remotely significant to at least 20 people (that's assuming only the winning guild would get something and that's not how most competitions work), it starts to ramp up rather quickly right?<br />
<br />
Just to put it in perspective, if they gave them $5000 each, that costs Blizzard $100,000<br />
<br />
Also, by E-Sport standards, WoW Arena Prize pools aren't that big at all when you look at LoL's, DoTA2's or CSGO's for example, and even then most, if not all of it is covered by advertisement revenues it generates, on top of the fact that it serves as a massive advertisement campaign for these games/companies themselves.</div></div><hr />

Its not so much as justifying as saying Blizzard is inconsistent. They ban randomly for random things and then leave other boss exploits alone. I think the whole point isn't a cry for justification, more than it would be nice to have consistency from the Developers as to how they properly test their content and how fast they fix their bugs and their actions against guilds/players. The fact that this bug was being reported for 9 days before the first exploited kill happened without getting a fix is completely on Blizzards head and not the guilds who assumed because it wasn't fixed it was part of the design. The fact that guilds killed Mythic Odyn when he wasn't doing mechanics, only melee attacks, and they didn't get banned for that exploit is a good example of the randomness, or when Mythic Elerethe had to be fixed after a couple guilds killed her, yet nothing happened to those guilds. Or with Mythic Xavius and the Imp dispelling, again no bans. That's just 3 examples from this expansion alone.</div></div><hr />

Just to put it in perspective, if they gave them $5000 each, that costs Blizzard $100,000<br />
<br />
Also, by E-Sport standards, WoW Arena Prize pools aren't that big at all when you look at LoL's, DoTA2's or CSGO's for example, and even then most, if not all of it is covered by advertisement revenues it generates, on top of the fact that it serves as a massive advertisement campaign for these games/companies themselves.<br />
<br />
Blizzard usually gives out 200k in arena price pools during blizzcon, even though there is only like 30k people watching on twitch, and no one gives a shit about wow arena. If the world first race got promoted it would generate way more viewers and way more PR. <br />
<br />
<br />
Also death skipping crystals, breaths, big dmg is a legit tactic. Guilds use it all the time. Its all on blizzard for not fixing a bug they knew about on the PTR, the 8 day ban is stupid. At most what they should have done is fix the p3 bug and remove the kill, so the three guilds could kill it the blizzard intended way.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand what's wrong with his statement? They love raiding at a competitive level so of course they would like raiding to be taken more seriously by blizzard themselves since it's their game.<br />
<br />
Nah, money prize for PvE would be too much, don't forget it's a fight against heavily scripted (and in some cases buggy) NPC, it's not a chess match against highly advanced AI, it's not a top-end PvP match against unpredictable, skilled and creative players either.<br />
<br />
I don't want to sound like a shit-poster or an ignorant person, I myself used to raid quite hardcore back in WotLK and Cata, but I'll say it anyway, high-end PvE raid race is a bit meh and dull. Blizz can't even stream it real-time, cuz quite often it requires hundreds of wipes to kill a boss, heck, even top guilds themselves are refusing to stream their progression :p<br />
<br />
However, acknowledging, and announcing winners, or some PR from Blizz would be quite cool.</div></div><hr />

They would be obviously streaming the whole thing. The reason they are not doing it now is because they don't get any benefit from it but it's just a disadvantage because as you said someone might spy what they are doing on a certain fight.<br />
<br />
But don't they love the PvE race so much that they want others to see and love it as well? Or do they just want enough money for a year from 2 weeks of &quot;work&quot; when a raid is released?</div></div><hr />

First of he is the Archetyp of douche highlvl raider (These PoV is not uncommon once you reach top 100)<br />
<br />
Second of as you dont race against the Content but against other Guilds on time, it would be possible to get a good competetive view out of it (exspecially with limited trys and chars on it, making execution instead of efford the main part, and making real head to head possible) , but my main Problem ist his justification.

Thats the thing though, the encounter was bugged. This strat would had been equal as the archimonde strat IF Helya didnt bug out and never did breaths again. So what Exorsus and other top guilds did, were a 100% legitimate strat, but due to the encounter being bugged, they are getting the blame for cheating? <br />
<br />
As we can see in the logs, is that they could had sacrificed the tank 3-4 times during that fight if she kept doing the breaths, and thats because they had the battleresses for it, which would had served them the kill. Hell, they could had done the breath properly the two-three first times and then started killing off the tank, which people did on archimonde as well, AND which became a legitimate strat.<br />
<br />
Do you see now? This strat is perfectly fine, its because the encounter was bugged that it backlashed on the top guilds, and which causes ignorant people like you to lash out on them as if they've commited some huge f*** crime.</div></div><hr />

They could, but they didn't.<br />
For Archi, you always had to sacrifice a tank for each crystal. For Helya, they just had to sacrifice a tank once. That's of course NOT the same, lol.<br />
If you know that it's a bug, then why do you still intentionally do and force it again. I'm glad Blizzard banned these guilds and revoked the kill and the people abusing the AP world quest bug lately. These guys just don't know what &quot;fair play&quot; is.</div></div><hr />

Well, in their post they did write a way in which it's possible - to have a pet which is a small version of the final boss, sell it in Blizz store, and give 10% of the money to the top guilds. Don't know how much money these guilds will make that way, but it won't come out of Blizzard's pockets, they even get to keep 90% of the money earned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well if they sell a pet at £10 and blizz take a 50% which is probably very low and 50% goes in the prize pot they would need almost 100000 people buying it to get a decent pot going. But when thats not enough they will probably complain they need a bigger pot etc etc. <br />
It also doesnt stop them still selling boosts so its just more money on top of what they are doing now so its not changing the situation.<br />
<br />
Also PvE race isnt an organised competition it never was it purely something the community made to create bragging rights and over time escalated to its current form of people taking time off work etc to get thier 5mins of internet fame. Theres no reason at all to give them a prize pot. It thier choice to do all that for no reason its not blizz job to make their choice more profitable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not defending them, but they brought so many people w/ CR to CR tanks who died to breath in p3, CRing players isn't a bug, it's not even an exploit, it's legit strategy, however there's no breath in p3, and that's the bug.<br />
<br />
TBF, exorsus guys were wrong to use that bug, even if they didn't know about it beforehand, they should've wiped and come up w/ another strategy to work around that bug.<br />
<br />
However Blizzard devs aren't saint either, for some reason, this expansion devs are REALLY slow at fixing bugs, they don't fix many important/game-breaking bugs ASAP, they just leave them be until quite a big number of players start either abusing it, or suffering from it, and it's been this way since beta. For instance, notorious bug w/ undead bat-rider in Stormheim, it's reported numerous times during beta, but they let it be for more than 6 months, and released the game w/o fixing it, but they had to fix it as soon as people started levelling in that zone on live O_o Now there's this bug w/ hidden artefact skins and their tints, it's so widespread that many people think it's a feature and that's how things are supposed to be, so now we have &quot;unleashed monstrosities doesn't unlock artefact skin/tint&quot; drama, and the only reason why it happens is because blizzard decided not to address this bug o_O</div></div><hr />

Yeah I know, but by P3 they had a lot more cr's remaining then they would've. That is an edge gained from exploiting a bug. Maybe they were more calm about the whole fight knowing they had 5 or however many extra CRs. That might've made it easier.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps step 1 is not to take your playtime as a Job. You didnt join a competitive game scene with a big prize pool. Why should Blizz care about you? <br />

The tank dies in p1, and it results in the breaths stopping completely in p3, they 100% knew that this was going to be looked at questionably by blizzard. Its different from archimonde because it completely removes an entire mechanic from a phase.Unless they killed helya the very first time they entered p3 after the tank dying in p1then its not excusable. Its just sad cus these guys are good enough to do it without using this, makes you wonder why they did.<br />
The post though is just a big distraction from them actually exploiting, at least limit just came out and said fuck it yeah we exploited we accept the punishment, not whined about other aspects of the game and how they believe they are owed money just because they nolife and play wow more than others.<br />

Yes, but that's not what you said.<br />
Your statement was that there is no fight which requires players to die (for these fights it was required because it is part of their mechanics).<br />
<br />

<br />
why ? smarter ones make buisness/living on twitch - dumb ones ? cause they have 0 achievments in real so they fake fake glory on webs. <br />
nothing happens when they quit - after few weeks nobody rememebrs that there even was such player.<br />
<br />
mythic progression is simply not material for e - sport - who would pay for possibility to watch 8-16 hours of contant wipes on 1 boss ? nobody when there is ton of streamers stremaning their progression anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't want to sound like a shit-poster or an ignorant person, I myself used to raid quite hardcore back in WotLK and Cata, but I'll say it anyway, high-end PvE raid race is a bit meh and dull. Blizz can't even stream it real-time, cuz quite often it requires hundreds of wipes to kill a boss, heck, even top guilds themselves are refusing to stream their progression :p<br />
<br />
However, acknowledging, and announcing winners, or some PR from Blizz would be quite cool.<br />
<br />
That is not the reason why they don't stream and you should check wow twitch streams when mythic progress starts. There are thousands of people watching guilds progressing that are not even in top 5. Also while pvp is unpredictable and I give you that, pve is that easy that after 7 days only 2 guilds had a clean kill of helya.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to put it in perspective, if they gave them $5000 each, that costs Blizzard $100,000<br />
<br />
Also, by E-Sport standards, WoW Arena Prize pools aren't that big at all when you look at LoL's, DoTA2's or CSGO's for example, and even then most, if not all of it is covered by advertisement revenues it generates, on top of the fact that it serves as a massive advertisement campaign for these games/companies themselves.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to discuss or make a business plan for raiding to be an attractive e-sport, but to sum up this reddit post blizzard just don't give a fuck about the race to the point that they don't even congratulate the winners, nor they have some kind of ranking on the website like they have for pvp and mythic +.<br />
I'm pretty sure though that if they make pve an e-sport and force top guilds to stream their attempts and there is a good reception more sponsors will contact these guilds to have their brand advertised on their stream.</div></div><hr />

Aside from the simple fact that you can earn more than enough money from streaming the game, making video guides and getting a sponsor without bug using or violating the ToS World of Warcraft was never meant to be competitive on an professional E-Sports Level and arguing that it should be won't change that. Don't get me wrong: I do use websites like wowprogress and I like a bit of ambition and competiton within the game, but it is and never will be an E-Sport. The only thing that comes close is the Arena Championship because you can play it in some sort of sandbox enviroment with equal opportunities for everyone. You are free to try that if you think you've got what it takes.<br />
As for your silly excuses concerning ToS-violation every top guild uses:<br />
1) The small abuses: That is the one and only point I would see even worthwhile to discuss: If it just &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot; ist O.K. with me.<br />
2) Account sharing: The way it is done is hard to prove but if Blizzard notices one and the same Person playing in England with one of his accounts and Italy with another, they should take action (now you can use VPN to cover that up to a certain extend...)!<br />
3) Boosting for real money should be absolutly forbidden and lead to a permanent account termination of all people involved - if people in a so called pro-guild have to rely on these kinds of services to make a living, they should better go casual and get a real job. Aside from the fact that most of these businesses are illegal because the people involved to not pay any kind of taxes or social security (making this tax evasion and maybe even money laundering), the whole concept is killing the game by offering a pay-to-win option (you wanted the game to be a fair competition on all levels, right?). The one thing from Blizzard that I do not get is that some of the same people doing live raids or Arena Competitions on BlizzCon, GamesCom and other high profile conventions are the ones offering boosts for huge amounts of real money on their guilds / Arena Teams Websites. Yet they are never banned or at least uninvited from these events. The problem with drawing attention from the boosting crowd to fill up your roosters is home made. Instead of recruiting People with a passion and talent for the game, you invite a bunch of greedy suckers, who would leave your guild any moment you stopped generating money for them. If your guild needs gold to keep up with the race, we can have an argument about that, but at least it is within the rules.<br />
4) If decide on letting you tank die to a certain mechanic, because rezzing him is less of an effort than playing a certain mechanic it is very different from discovering you can shut down a mechanic completely from doing a certain thing, because everybody sane person would notice that this was not intended. You guy never learn: The Kinds of statements always appear after major f#ß! ups. Be it saronite bombs &quot;we though that was part of the mechanic&quot; (yeah right, using a bomb usually constructs larger platforms), LRF abuses in Dragon Soul &quot;everybody did it, so we did as well because competition&quot; (Paragon was the only guild back than with an honest we're sorry&quot;, while FtH prefered to hold ist breath till they turned blue and stopped raiding because people are mean and now this one. Funny fact: Ist always some of the same people involved - just different guild tags. Think about it.<br />
Not fixing a bug is not an excuse to use it. If by chance i found a way to use your credit card via Internet, because there was a bug in the security system of your bank, I'll use the same silly excuse when I'm caught. &quot;Please Mr. Judge, I thought it was okay! I told them there was a bug, but since they did not fix it ASAP, I grabbed all the money I could get.&quot;</div></div><hr />

A) I know why they don't stream :p<br />

B) I didn't say easy, I said dull and meh. Viewers don't see raid fights as something engaging, it's like watching ants fighting against bugs on NatGeo channel. There are way too many things happening on the screen: 20 players, shitton of mobs and a boss. It's not that interesting to many, cuz they can't relate to anyone in particular, majority of people likes to have fav heroes, people want to cheer for a certain person or two, not 20 ppl raid :p There's no PotG, no MVP...<br />
<br />
Moreover, It's quite difficult to comment on such things, heck, even in PvP it's quite difficult to adequately comment during 3v3 matches. That's one of the reasons why competitive RBG isn't a thing.</div></div><hr />

I agree on this one, as I said earlier, some form of acknowledgement, coverage and PR would be a nice thingy to have.<br />

If you feel you need to let a player die, then you are using the wrong approach..<br />
<br />
It's one game when you're trying to beat something 1st.<br />
<br />
It's a totally diferent game when you're trying to beat something while overgearing it (probably your example).<br />
<br />
When you want to beat it 1st (you know, race for world 1st, lol), you will have to deal with a boss tuned for a higher ilvl than your raid have, because it's the intended way for most players, to keep farming initial bosses to increase their power and have an easier time on final bosses.<br />
<br />
That's why they prefer to use the resources avaiable (like a battle res) for a tank to keep dpsing the boss instead of dpsing a crystal. But as they said, the crystal will come back later (unlike Helya's breath).<br />
<br />
They use their BRs avaiables for these, while the rest of the players use to fix their raid's mistakes (like dpsers standing on fire, lol).<br />

So those top guilds use exploits, break the ToS , kind of hate what they do (playing 6 alts, rerolling when you get 4 shit legendaries, etc.) and somehow feel they should be paid for it. <br />
<br />
What I miss is the 'why'. What happens when they simply quit? It's just a small percentage of players that care about the race, most don't even know there is a race and won't care if it stops. I say just permaban their asses and be done with it. The carrying for real money does more bad for the game then the race does good, so bye bye.<br />
<br />
That's indeed a good point... why should anyone sponsor players that cheat???<br />
<br />
But about the &quot;small percentage that care&quot;, I'm surprised to still see people talking about who beat the latest boss 1st in the general/trade chats in the servers I play. Really doubt that knowing about it is a &quot;small percentage&quot;.</div></div><hr />

They would like the pve race to be officially covered by blizzard with official rules, and one of this rules would be that they are forced to stream all of their progress. He also mentioned that it would be nice to have a prize pool for the winners like every other e-sport, to get more people involved in the race as not many people are willing to raid at that level at the moment.

To be fair, such a small percentage of people care about who kills a boss first. The top end raiders are doing this to themselves. They created this so-called race. They don't have to spend 14+ hours a week. They are burning themselves out. They only have themselves to blame.<br />
<br />

So the fight being broken meant that they had to change their perfectly valid strategy purely to avoid exploiting a broken mechanic. Ultimately if the fight was not buggy their strategy is perfectly valid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me point out that one of the other banned guilds that is in full support of being banned because they... 1) saw that it was an exploint, and reported the bug 2) and avoiding it knowing that using that to kill the boss would be an exploit... said it was the tank dying when targeted by the breath. So the perfect valid strat that that they had to change was to 'not let the tank die' when he was targetd with the breath. Fight might have been broken, but it is something they should have been avoiding doing anyhow, sorry.</div></div><hr />

The people talking in chat is by definition a small percentage. The rest of the players is actually playing :) Most people I've met have trade/general chat turned of since an hour after entering the main city for the first time ever ;)<br />
<br />
Blizzard once said that most players don't have any character at level cap (can't find the exact number atm). I think it's a safe assumption that those people don't know and/or care about 'the race'. That's already a majority right there.<br />
<br />
And the people who do care, would they quit when there is no more race? I doubt it. They are usually very vocal, but in the end the race has no direct impact on their game, so I doubt they'd actually quit.</div></div><hr />

Exactly my thoughts - No one is forcing anyone to play 4 alts because of legendary drops. Someone will always be first - if you want to commit the time and effort it is your choice. You can't live from that? Well then you need to get a job and work for money like we all do. I personally don't mind if it takes 1 week, 2 weeks or 2 months. This competition is only as hard as those top guilds created it.<br />
Remember Lich King? People QQ that it takes a lot of tries to kill a boss. Blizzard limited amount of tries. Top guilds made a lot of alts to have a lot of tries.</div></div><hr />

They would need addon restrictions, no access to ptr as testing on there gives a pretty huge insight to the bosses from 1st hand experience and what others stream. Its alotof work for something that is only a competition between a small circle of guilds as it requires alot of time and sacrifice to even be able to compete. PvP on the other hand you just need the ability and you can compete.<br />
<br />
Im sure many would like what they enjoy to be an esport. But you can just demand game devs make it a competition because you decide to spend and what many deem as unreasonable for nothing other than bragging rights to a small circle within the playerbase.</div></div><hr />

How disconnected from reality are these guys? Blizzard doesn't design this game so THEY can monetize it, and won't ever do it. The only reason the Arena tournament exists is because it generates advertisement revenue as E-Sports are engaging to watch in general, nobody is going to watch them &quot;race&quot; bosses everyone has been killing on whatever difficulty already for months by the time Blizzcon comes out lol.<br />
<br />
Time for them to finally get out of the basement and get a fucking job.<br />
<br />
Totally agree top end guilds and raiders are a cancer for the game it was high time Blizz stopped designing the game around these fools and catering to them. They are the ones that will complain about any little thing Blizz implements if it does not cater to them or benefit their mythic raiding. Don't get me wrong I like PvE and raiding but not to the extent these high end guilds take it too. This statement by Exorsus just validates my point even more. How delusional are these guys?</div></div><hr />

It's not enough that they were exploiting in a WF race. Now they are trying to blame it on Blizz. Pathetic.<br />

<br />
As far as them getting paid for playing a game, we've been doing that for a long time. Adults all over the world get paid to play game that we watch. <br />
<br />
If there's an audience who wants to watch top end PVE, I don't see why there wouldn't be a reward/pay system for the winners and a route for revenue via sponsorship.</div></div><hr />

this is still the case if you go to a stream site like twitch... its not the pve-er that have the big viewnumbers its the pvp-ers<br />
hell for a non wow player seeing a raid is basicly watching something on lsd... might look nice with the collors and stuff but wtf is going on.<br />
also how do you showcase a 20men thing in a correct and understandable way?<br />
<br />
also stop feeling entitled because your a top x guild.... you're not the focus for blizzard... hell ill even go as far that you guys hardly even make money<br />
blizz is still a bussiness and what do they want... money<br />
<br />
the whole rand about legendaries en splitraids is only relevant for maby 1% of the playerbase<br />
no one cares about you.... you wanna be the best... good luck... but it means investing time and indeed if rng isnt in your favor create more rng chances , cause wow so balanced outside of that... no...whole wow is rng...you have a chance to kill a boss for a chance that it drops loot for a chance to get it... so not rng<br />
<br />
min/max-ing is for the elite and being elite means investing time<br />

'we cheated and got caught, now were gonna try and drag every other guild down and blizzard.' Salty bastards.<br />
Why even bring up such a statement like that hahaha it felt like desperation yapping on about legendarys, and other reasons why it wasnt there fault that they cheated but the systems instead. <br />
<br />
From scratch basically saying 'we did it just in case someone else did it and got away with it before us....so it must of been ok yes?'<br />
<br />
Love it when things like this happens because its like he said in his statement, PVE is not showcased as much simply because your not worth it to them.<br />
The moneys in the esports side of the game. <br />
So stop being salty cheating fucks and get on with your bans like men, no one will give a fuck till next raid tier.</div></div><hr />

But looking at legendary paragraph it actually worries me how much he is right, and 4 legendaries soft cap for real? If that statement is true, and blizzard fucked up this, or it's intended then rip. Get 4 legendary items which decides your spec and you are stuck to it. <br />
<br />
I raid only in heroic but I like to compete for highest parses in logs so I often switch to what is best spec, it's my personal thing and I know no one cares about heroic logs but still, it would make me really sad if I wouldnt be able to switch to potentially better spec which outscales my current spec + need legendary to shine. <br />
<br />
I would straight hate to pve anymore if this will stay true. As he said, either make all legendaries utility so it won't decide our spec/playstyle or remove that retarded softcap, as by a little research on that topic it seems very legit and even players from top guilds admit that it's very possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand what they said about legendaries (which was confirmed there is softcap 4 legendaries ... WTF? dropped 4 which sucks and you were finished) and fact PvE race could use more popularity. Even small events where will be streamed race and people could actually learn something from their mentality (does not mean using exploits, but how they approach the fights).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guigui7</div><div class="date">2016-11-24, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) &quot;Small abuses&quot; - as if them being &quot;small&quot; makes it ok... This is why we do not care about your top 10 rankings and shit, as we all know you abused every possible mechanic you could. <br />
Also crap like this: &quot;however i do hope they can show some love to dedicated players of their game too.&quot; - Basicly saying that people who are not exploiting to be in top 10 kills are not dedicated fans - what a load of crap.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with exploiting, they play stupid high amount of hours and had to have 6... not 1 or 2....SIX alts geared up, add to the alt cancer legendary RNG and AP farming... That is some dedication only top 10ish guilds have. You can claim you are a dedicated fan, it can be true, but not as dedicated as them. FFS with the amount of hours they put in the game... its their job at this point. Who can blame them for boosting..... I dont even understand why people care about boosting, do you get poked in the ribs everyime they sell a run?! I for one can sleep at night..... I'll throw that out there also... flash news, most guilds that sits in the top 400-500 even 1000 sells run for gold and or real $$ the only diff is that they're not in the spotlight like the top guilds and most likely would never get caught for that reason. As long as you are 1st on your server and can carry people, runs will be sold.<br />
<br />
Does that mean that if they're selling runs they're bad people? Hell no, I'm sure to some extent a top player on your server helped you improve or something like that, that same player probably got payed X gold or Y$ that same night for raiding. It doesn't make them fucking monsters.<br />
<br />
Yes they exploited, so what, who gives a shit, most guilds did and they all got the same punishment. It is true that blizzard isn't consistent with their ban, 3 tier no bans, next tier everyone gets banned. I'm not going to go in the whole debate but I'll just say this... maybe if they tested the encounter with every possible strats (Like killing a tank... which btw... was a legit strat if it wasn't for the ability vanishing from P3)<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a grey zone imo, should they get banned, should they be able to abuse like that...? Who the hell knows, just like any situation people will be for or against the situation. But straight up bashing and putting words / making tl;dr just to make them sounds like they're bitching is straight up 4 years old mentality. It is true that blizzard has always lacked support toward the PvE race. I dont think monetization is the solution, but I do think there should be some kind of rewards for top10 guilds or so. Reason why I say monetization sucks is the only reason that if &quot;X&quot; guild gets 2nd without doing this one minor exploit on the final boss and &quot;Y&quot; gets 1st doing that exploit, now we encounter a problem with abusing game mechanics.... but with money on the line this time. There has to be some kind of reward tho, I think we can all agree on that. The amount of time these people put into the game is crazy stupid and they shouldn't do that only to leave empty handed with &quot;World 1st guild&quot; on a 3rd party site and get some recognition. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I don't think this will change everyone's mentality, but hopefully it will help some. Also, sorry for my English mistakes here and there, it's not my first language.</div></div><hr />

We know the 4 legendary softcap is a thing now, they removed it since and wrote a post about it and the increase in legendary drop rate as well. <br />
<br />
Its on each guild to do what they want as a guild and to progress how they want. If a guild such as Exorsus, Method, Serenity or any other decides they wish to take part in the world first race, great on them, they have a ton more time than others so they can do that. While I agree that there should be some incentive for the top 50-100 guilds that do progress this way it should not be cash incentive. At most it should be something in game or even free game time for the time and effort they out forward.<br />

If only you'd read my previous comments you'd know that I also think that giving out money for PvE is too much...<br />
<br />
However, I do think that some form of coverage and/or acknowledgment from Blizzard would be a nice thing to have.<br />
<br />
And who is forcing us to be first, seconds and ninth in PvP? No one, but ourselves :p In this regard PvP and PvE are quite close. PvPers and PvEers do what they do cuz they want. But it's much easier to stream and comment on PvP matches, it's much easier for viewers to relate to individual participants, there are MVPs/PotGs, and matches are relatively short. Overall 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 PvP is much more viewer-friendly, heck, IMHO, something can be done about challenging 5man PvE content too. 5v5 speed runs through insanely tuned brand new M+. Something like EU vs NA dungeon run Blizz hosted before Legion's launch.<br />
<br />
But tournaments related to BGs and/or PvE raids? Nah, never... And I explained why in one of my earlier comments :p</div></div><hr />

So the perfect valid strat that that they had to change was to 'not let the tank die' when he was targetd with the breath. Fight might have been broken, but it is something they should have been avoiding doing anyhow, sorry.<br />
<br />
Disagree, letting the tank die as a strategy to deal with a mechanic is something that is regularly used as a tactic for killing bosses. It was and is used on Elerethe Renferal for the winds as recent as Emerald Nightmare, it was used for the source on Archimonde, it was used on Twin Ogrons in Highmaul. There have been loads of situations where the strategy was &quot;let the tank die and just battle res him&quot;, going as far back as I can remember, think there was something like that used on Anub'arak in Trial of the Grand Crusader too.<br />
<br />
Unless Blizzard removes battle res from the game or changes fights to react differently to tank deaths then it will remain a valid and widely used strategy for for the foreseeable future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The irony is also delicious. Coming off with some flimsy excuses while their exploits are ok but at the same time no one takes the &quot;pro-raiding&quot; scene seriously. Yeah, I can't imagine why that would be.</div></div><hr />

Does he really think if Blizzard started handing out cash prizes for raiding that the time a player has to invest would actually decrease?<br />
<br />
And would people really watch hours upon hours of a guild wiping? I know I'm relatively old and watching other people play games on Twitch seems like a waste of time, but I can't see that attracting a dependable audience large enough to even break even. If the top guilds want to do that, they can organize it on their own and gather their own paying audience. If it proves a success then you know Blizzard will take notice.</div></div><hr />

The game itself is supposed to be the reward. How entitled could you be? Maybe you need to take a step back and re-evaluate your life, perhaps find a new game, if that's your attitude. And no, I don't think WoW PvP warrants tournaments either, but the simple fact is, watching people compete against other people is vastly more entertaining than watching people compete against gameplay mechanics.</div></div><hr />

PVE race is also about skill but time investment plays a far bigger role than skill. As they mention themselves, it's the question of whether you can be online for 14h+ per day for 2 weeks. That's why it shouldn't be endorsed by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

a wall of text which can be sum up in &quot;bla bla bla we re top mythic guild so we deserve to cheat without punishemt ... blabla bla legendaries are unfair ... bla bla bla we should be able to boost for real money thus violating ToS &quot; - bunch of cheating crybabies.<br />
<br />
So openly admitting is disgusting, but hiding and denying it like a little girl who's been naughty is admirable to you?</div></div><hr />

Not only that, but they also have the audacity to actually try to milk blizz for money &quot;yeah, totally give us a prize pool here, sure we break the rules to keep at top but you still should put in money rewards for us&quot;. It's like a sports athlete who got caught using doping and trying to justify their using as &quot;everyone uses and what's the big deal&quot; and that's why they should get to keep their medals.</div></div><hr />

Yup, in the past someone has stepped up to take over addons when we news them, hopefully if people like it this will be the case here.<br />

I love this addon. I think it is the best thing ever. I sure hope someone maintains it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is the artificially amped up silliness over being first. Considering it gets you nothing beyond bragging rights, it's really, really silly to put so much blood sweat and tears into it to the point you feel you need to smack the ToS around like its a punching bag.<br />
<br />
If the race is so tough that you feel the need to break the rules, it's time to reassess, not time to break the rules. If you still choose to break the rules, then own your decision and don't try to justify it through &quot;everyone's doing it&quot; or its &quot;Blizzard's fault&quot; because no one made you do it but you. <br />
<br />
I thought it was irritating when people whine about &quot;broken&quot; specs because they do like 1% or less dps than other classes/specs, but this is a new level of ridiculous. <br />
<br />
Here's to hoping Exorsus and other guilds that allegedly use the ToS for kindling get banned for their absurdity.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ElDoorO</div><div class="date">2016-11-25, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy hell. There are some ridiculous people here. Let me guess -- all of you were surprised that people got caught using steroids in baseball too? Anyone who actually watched even passively at Hooters knew what was up or had their head in the sand.<br />
<br />
Look -- we deal in the real world. We don't live in a fair and balanced utopia. That's just the way it is. You're welcome to deny it all you want.<br />
<br />
If you report a serious bug and Blizzard doesn't do anything -- or even acknowledge it -- what are you suppose to do? Perhaps that's beyond your ability to comprehend. I'll use something most of you are familiar with: Sports. You find out the reason every other team is so insanely strong is because they use illegal drugs. There's practically no one the officials don't know this. So what do you do? Get on your high horse and walk away? No. You play the same fucking game everyone else does. You fall in line.<br />
<br />
These guilds have more balls to admit they were cheating than people here. Botters get caught and own up to it? More balls than you.<br />
<br />
But instead of being constructive and going &quot;wow, maybe Blizzard should put forth an effort to discourage this and find a better way to get that information from these people&quot; they get attacked. Great job.<br />
<br />
You'd like to think that for the top 100 guilds they'd have a better contact system to say &quot;shits broke, yo&quot; instead of the dismal customer service that's default reply is almost always &quot;as intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then they go on to list other issues and, again, aren't treated seriously. The 4 legendary system people kept saying doesn't exist? Turned out it did. The &quot;if you find one legendary you have a great chance of getting another one&quot; that totally impossible and people just &quot;didn't understand statistics&quot;? Yeah, those people were wrong.<br />
<br />
Again, and again -- people are shown Blizzard fucks up and are mocked. Sigh.</div></div><hr />

At least one of the guilds (Limit) had the guts to own their decision and say &quot;yes, we did it, and yes we deserve the ban.&quot; That gets respect from me, especially after the sad 'justifications' from Exorsus and From Scratch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because &quot;falling in line&quot; takes so much guts right?<br />
<br />
And here's the thing you're skipping right past on your way to justifying the actions of these guilds - this isn't justification. <br />
<br />
Using your sports analogies - I seem to recall Lance Armstrong being stripped of trophies and publicly disgraced for doping. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, if you break the rules of the game, you need to own up to that decision and accept it if and when you get caught. The flimsy justification of &quot;everyone else does it&quot; is not a valid argument to change that, especially when the race these guilds are pushing to be competitive in has gotten to this point through the construct of their own competitiveness. Blizzard provides no incentives for this.</div></div><hr />

When you say &quot;hey, everyone is doing this&quot; and they fail to acknowledge it and do something about it quickly -- that's on Blizzard.<br />
How long should you wait? A day? A week? A month? A year? Forever and ever?<br />
<br />
In a competitive environment you don't have long to wait before you have to make a call but I doubt you've ever been in a competitive environment in any capacity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So we'll just call this here. I mean, if the best tactic you have is ad hominem, then you have no argument. <br />
<br />
Also, the psychic powers you must clearly possess to make such a claim are very impressive. Do you only use them to lose internet arguments?</div></div><hr />
