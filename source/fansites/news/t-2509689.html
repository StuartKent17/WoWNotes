Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Azshara’s Eternal Palace<br />
<br />
The Queen’s Court<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue with Repeat Performance (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/304409-repeat-performance) where Ignore Pain triggered from Warriors’ Bastion of Might (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/287377-bastion-of-might) (Azerite Trait) was counted as a cast, causing them to be silenced if they used Ignore Pain after casting Avatar.<br />
<br />
Queen Azshara<br />
<br />
Overzealous Hulks should no longer be affected by snaring abilities or gain the Infuriated (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/300428-infuriated) buff from such abilities.<br />
<br />
Developers’ note: Since Overzealous Hulks become immune upon the first expiration of a crowd-control ability, using a movement speed reduction effect on them was generally a trap, and sometimes unavoidable for players with uncontrollable snares tied to their rotational abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Temple of Sethrallis<br />
<br />
Removed a Void Emissary near the pack of enemies by Galvazzt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Tauren players who completed their Heritage Armor quest line can now turn in “Remembrance” to Baine in Thunder Bluff.<br />
&quot;Show Me What You've Got (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/48939-show-me-what-youve-got)&quot; is no longer required for the The Norwington Estate quest line in Tiragarde Sound.<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW Classic<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where turning in the Head of Rend Blackhand for the quest “For the Horde!” was not granting the Warchief's Blessing buff to players in Orgrimmar.</div></div><hr />
