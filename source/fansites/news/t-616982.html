End of Arena Season 4 Coming Soon / Patch 3.0.2 Release date<br />
Season 4 will end on October 14, it wouldn't be surprising to see the Patch 3.0 deployed on live servers on the same day. (Not surprising = 95% chance to happen)<br />
We’re currently planning to end the fourth Arena season on October 14, 2008, and as always -- this date could easily change. This Arena Season is only ending in respect to the ladder, meaning we'll be taking a snapshot of the season's ladder and then go through our normal process to determine who is eligible for the end-of-season rewards. This process should take approximately one week. It's very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for the arena-specific title and/or Armored Nether Drake to refrain from transferring their character to another realm between the date outlined above, and when the end-of-season rewards are physically awarded.<br />
<br />
Upon the end of this Arena Season, teams and ratings will not be wiped, and will carry forward allowing players to earn points each week and purchase gear until the launch of the expansion (November 13, 2008). <br />
<br />
<br />
WotLK - All TBC Raid instances massively nerfed<br />
It seems that the latest build brought an interesting change to TBC instances : all monsters in TBC raid instances had their health points reduced by 30%, bosses included. We don't know yet if this change is final, but below are a few exemples of changes for some of these instances, more values will be added as we go through the instances. Feel free to contribute with your own lists in comments. <br />
<br />
Note : The change isn't confirmed by Blizzard yet. We don't know if this change will be pushed live, and we don't know when it will happen but we might see this change shipped with Patch 3.0 before the release of the expansion<br />

Arena rating changes in WotLK<br />
Since we're talking about arena, it might be worth mentioning the change to the rating system now. <br />
There will be a new, persistent rating system that should keep top-rated players facing other top-rated players, regardless of the bracket in which their current team sits. We'll have more information to come on this soon. <br />

And a small thing to make all warriors very happy, and all other classes very unhappy in PvP. <br />
Ghost is out for the rest of the evening so I thought I would make a quick post regarding a new warrior change. Berserker Rage will now be usable in all stances.</div></div><hr />

I'm also kinda happy about the arena change, I mean i'm not a Arena fanatic (being a shaman) so it might make it a tiny bit more fun considering I won't have to deal with brutal warrior and druid teams anymore.</div></div><hr />

Because people only did the first bosses before reporting this change, ie they haven't been up to the other bosses and couldn't report their health level. It's difficult to report on the health value of a boss nobody has seen yet after the last patch.<br />
<br />
It would make sense to have it up only on the PTR (testing of the current encounters with new talents, ie finding out if there's any boss ability that can't be beaten with the changes) or to have it go over on live (allow people to finish all instances they are currently working on).<br />
We'll see what happens.</div></div><hr />

Hydross = Easiest??? Probably one of the harder fights in SSC mostly due to the resistance gear needed, and having 25 people stop DPS:ing when Hydross changes between phases.<br />

all monsters in TBC raid instances had their health points reduced by 30%, bosses included.<br />

Obviously people are not able to progress much further than the beginning of the instance if they're doing it solo, but sofar every mob encountered in raid instances have had ~30% health reductions.</div></div><hr />

I hope they increase the cooldown on 'zerker rage. 30 second instacast nocost CC breaker for 10 seconds in any stance is just slightly OP. Warlocks and priests will be consistently destroyed by this.<br />
<br />
IF they keep it at 30 seconds, they really need to change Hand of Freedom for pallies. Otherwise we're again holding the shortend of the stick for CC mechanics, because even though hand of freedom can break stuns (on other targets), it doesn't grant immunity while it's active, or break fear. We have divine shield sure, but that's a huge cooldown compared to 'zerker rage.<br />

I'm not going to complain if they don't change Hand of Freedom, but it would be nice to have another CC breaker besides divine shield....</div></div><hr />

Maybe the number one thing that burned me out on arena was facing full s4 rogues in the 1700-1800 bracket over and over and over. I had thought that this was the worst current problem in arena but really didnt expect to see it addressed so soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
nah, the worst thing is seeing rogues in 4piece s4, 4piece t6, and both warglaives.</div></div><hr />

It was as if thousands of casters cried out for a second before they were silenced by dual twohanders ripping them to shreds every 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
I hope they increase the cooldown on 'zerker rage. 30 second instacast nocost CC breaker for 10 seconds in any stance is just slightly OP. Warlocks and priests will be consistently destroyed by this.<br />
<br />
IF they keep it at 30 seconds, they really need to change Hand of Freedom for pallies. Otherwise we're again holding the shortend of the stick for CC mechanics, because even though hand of freedom can break stuns (on other targets), it doesn't grant immunity while it's active, or break fear. We have divine shield sure, but that's a huge cooldown compared to 'zerker rage.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to complain if they don't change Hand of Freedom, but it would be nice to have another CC breaker besides divine shield....<br />
<br />
Priest fear is already weak.<br />
Warlocks are shred to pieces anyway by most warriors.<br />
So not really any difference :&gt;</div></div><hr />

It's to speed up leveling, just like they did with 20-60 a few months ago. It's a lot easier for them to just implement a &quot;all mobs over level 60 reduce health by 30%&quot; than to go through every single mob in the game and determine whether it should have its health reduced or not. The leveling speed increase from 60-70 is going in in the patch, so the mob health is being reduced at the same time.</div></div><hr />

In my Kara run on the PTR, we had fewer mana issues than ever before. I stopped to drink maybe 10% as often as I do on live and the priest who was solo healing the raid never complained once.

Mana is not an issue in beta, since the MP5/Spirit regen for healers is absolutely outrageous, (in a good way), and other casters also received a healthy dose of regen lovin'. The fights seem more about dealing with rapidly changing situations, making the players deal with various problems storming at them very fast. Heroic Dungeons are a great test to see who in your group knows their class, and who clicks around with buttons, hoping the other players carry them. Mana, however, is usually not an issue.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you, this should have been implemented months ago.<br />
There is no reason why Blizzard couldn't &quot;force&quot; a rating on gear, <br />
so that those people who like to steamroll the nubs can't just by reforming teams.<br />
<br />
Great, you have a s4 weapon - your rating remains at 2050 regardless of the team you are on.<br />
You have s4 shoulders, awesome! - your rating remains at 2200 regardless of the team you are on.<br />
<br />
This should hold true for all of the armor that is rated. <br />
This would solve a lot of issues different people have with arena.<br />

<br />
Going out on a limb here, it could be entirely possible the PR is locked once you are wearing certain pieces of gear, which is what I hope. So, if you get shoulders, your PR won't fall below 2200 until the next arena season starts, and it will go back to being based on team rating only for points. Basically solves the entire problem right there, you get less points for new teams, and your new team is queuing high enough to ignore starting players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Meh, not quite so dire as ppl make it out to be as you have other mechanics to counterbalance it. Still, a 10-15% HP nerf would have accounted for the changes in raid stacking/mechanics. 30% is gift-wrapping the encounters.</div></div><hr />

Only time HP is a factor is if your running into the enrage timer. Most bosses in BT/Sunwell are more about situation awareness then how much dps the raid can put out. Most wipes are caused by lack of coordination not the boss enraging.You need to look at the big picture of why they did this. One being the new talents and class balanceing. Another being pot sickness and how mana regens. There is less mana regen in 3.0.2 than there was before. VT is no longer based off how much dps the spriest can do. It restores a % of you base mana now. Spells are no longer given a set number for how much mana is used. It's all been put on a % of your base mana. We can no longer down rack our spells to conserve mana. Spells have been changed to the amount of damage they do to compensate for level scaling for when you hit 80 to keep them from being over powered. By making this change they didn't really change anything. If a boss was hard to you now it's still going to be hard for you in the patch with all the class specific changes.</div></div><hr />

that article is hilariously off base. yeah, we're losing stackable bloodlusts and stackable shadow priests, but we're gaining huge dps talents, raid wide buffs, mana regen abilities, etc. stacking bloodlusts and spriests did not account for 30% of raid dps anyway.</div></div><hr />

Untrue. Taking HP off the boss means your raid has less time that they have to perform without screwing up. Basically, any time you would have wiped under 30%, you now will end up winning. For bosses with adds, the adds will become a joke. Ghosts will be easier to kill on Gorefiend for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand people have to understand that quite a lot has changed for 3.0. It is, I guess at least, essential that raids get rebalanced aswell. The HP lowering was not the first thing to do on PTR and i doubt it is for giving a chence to see what players not raiding through the game have not seen. You must understand how such a balancing is done in a software as complex as this one.<br />
<br />
All changes may only be judged with lots of, and i mean lots of, logs created and analysed. To have lots of those logs they need lots of people testing. All of us may consider himself a tester from the very day of 3.0 going live far months well after WOTLK has been released.<br />
<br />
Such a radical cut in health is a very gross guess about how the game will change with 3.0. Once not only a few thousand, but a few million &quot;testers&quot; will do the testing you can expect tonns of patches in a short interval fine tuning actual numbers. It makes more sense turning this few weeks to the expansion a test period for masses than favoring the few guilds that are just now progressing through these raids.<br />

+ Less time spent on trash and bosses<br />
<br />
That means progression for guilds in BT/Sunwell full stop.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless your a Restoration Druid, which get a rough 20% healing nerf, ofcourse.<br />

<br />
<br />
Team rating: ~ The rating of the current team you are in.<br />
Personal rating: ~ Your current personal rating based on your participation in your teams games.<br />
Hidden rating: ~ Your heightest personal rating obtained.<br />
<br />
You will earn your arena points based on the TEAM rating unless your personal rating is over 150pts LOWER then your TEAM rating and you will be matched VS players with an average Hidden rating based on the players in the queue.<br />
<br />
Eg;<br />
<br />
I get 2200 rating with my druid buddy.<br />
I then join a team with a freshly dinged player at 1500.<br />
The team will then get matched vs players who also have an average combined hidden rating of 1500+2200/ 2 = 1850.<br />
Your still awarded Arena Points based on your current team.<br />
<br />
The only thing that remains to be seen is how the win/lose points will be sorted out? eg if a 1500 rated team with 2 2200 players in beats a 2200 rated team with 2200 rated players in will they lose 25pts+? or will they lose 15? my hope is 15.</div></div><hr />

Only being able to drink a single mana pot per fight will significantly hurt a lot of casters and healers. Fights can't last as long with current gear with changes to the way pots and mana regen works, unless they're vastly different (i.e. buffed) from what I've seen.<br />

don't forget no more downranking heals</div></div><hr />

A different version I would prefer is: (unless everyone's in a 150-300 range) you are matched with teams of the team rating/highest rating of any participating player in the team, but gain points/rating based on your own rating.</div></div><hr />

Only one thing: I really hate, where really stay for REALLY, team full Season X (with shoulders, weapons and Jesus bless on neck...) that are matched @ 1550-1600 rating. WTF are they doing over there? Why they are not playing against teams of similar equip and every time we reached a nice rating a group of these get us lower and lower once again?<br />
<br />
I wanna play against people that have a similar equip, so i'd like to have an hidden rating (as you've told) to starts games on a similar plan. Nothing else. <br />
<br />
STOP doin' 2200 Teams Vs 1600 Teams , this is terrible and many players stop playing arena for this!</div></div><hr />

Yes. So I can spam more inefficient Lifeblooms and actually go oom since mana regeneration took a hit aswell.<br />

The only boss whose health I actually made note of was Nightbane's. He only had 960,000 hp. Throughout the run though everyone remarked at how incredibly fast everything was dying. We only had seven people and did a full clear in under two hours without rushing in any way. Stuff just fell over with almost no effort.<br />
<br />
<br />
Two words: Over powered! LOL<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I have also dabbled in the PTR for a moment... And ran a Heroic Shattered Halls... We downed the last boss and the timer in under 15 mins... The normal timer to rescuse the hostage is 45 mins - 1 hr... And we did it in 15 mins... Wow... And they maybe be nerffin the SSC, TK, Hyjal, BT, and Sunwell bosses and mobs?! Talk about those places on farm now till WotLK... Unfortunately they will also nerf the drops, including the legendary items :( Time to put those places on farm now before Oct 14th!!!</div></div><hr />

This is totally unfounded, you have no proof that legendary drops will get nerfed, from my own experience they actually seem to be increased. The amount of Thunderfury drops raised significantly by the end of pre-bc, and I know of guilds with upwards of 4 sets of warglaives now, who have not had Illidan on farm for very long at all. We even had 2 in the first 2 weeks we downed him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We were doing some heroics last night, and someone said heroics were nerfed, too, and from how we cut through some bosses, that may be correct. On my second bota run, with my badly equipped mage, we downed the Botanist in Botanica without him going into tree once.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laan</div><div class="date">2008-10-27, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dont understand this &quot;we have lvl 80 @ lvl 70&quot; mentality. As if you dont scale with gear? You know what? alot of classes dont get new ranks of spells to DPS with. Fact of life- new talents, plus new gear = the real buff you get. As far as i know, the only class/spec getting a new spell that changes their DPS entirely and not from a talent, is elemental shamans and lava burst. Thats it. If you were getting something new it was from talents(chaos bolt, frost-fire bolt, haunt, ect). <br />
<br />
Sitting here and claiming that you are &quot;lvl 80's @ lvl 70&quot; is complete crap and you know it. Ret pallies have been overpowered on beta for a long ass time, you had this coming.</div></div><hr />
