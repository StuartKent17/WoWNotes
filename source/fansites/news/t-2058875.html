I never really liked the dragons, they were all super boring personality-wise, just generic benevolent beings... more often than not in skimpy outfits. My opinion of them did not improve with the shittiest raid patch of all time, Dragonsoul, which was filled with them, their horrible voice acting and cringy writing :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
She was trying to bend the Val'kyr to her will; using that artifact she was holding. If she did that she would essentially be immortal; they would bring her back anytime she entered the shadowlands (that's their job for normal &quot;heros&quot;).<br />
<br />
By destroying the artifact, the being she was bending to her will was freed. She still has a few of them left, but when she goes through them, that's it... unless she figures out a different path. <br />
<br />
With that said, Genn is most likely going to be dead soon. She fired a Black Arrow at him. (which is probably why she did not run after him)</div></div><hr />

I believe it uses Shadow Poison, it is shadow based (at least in In-Game-Mechanics), and it slowly eats away at you... and if you die from it, you come back as undead. <br />

I think she is the only one that can cure it/dispel it... Not even Arthas could fight it. I am kind of miffed that Genn spoiled her plans...</div></div><hr />

This. &quot;Oh no my allies want to turn dragons into aspects to help protect the world. I don't like it. Hey Helya can you pull this piece of Ulduar out to come fly us in the sky?&quot; &quot;Hmmmm I can make valkyr, but it's painful and they never get to move on to the afterlife and I can force it upon people... Helya thinks it's bad and will leave me.... *turns her into the first one forcefully*</div></div><hr />

Genn spoiled Sylvanas's plan may be good for Sylvanas in the long run. She can seek another potentially better solution. <br />
I do not think enslaving Eyir is a permanent way to solve the problem. Eyir is not someone who would submit easily. Mind-controlling Eyir would go against the very foundation of forsaken. <br />
<br />
Personally I hope Sylvanas could take the place of Helya. Then she could offer each soul a choice made by free will, remaining dead or being raised as forsaken. <br />
<br />
Aduin can take Odin's power if balance between Alliance and Horde is an issue. Both Helya and Odin might need to go anyway in patch, so why not buff faction leaders a little bit? Especially considering that Players are very powerful in lore now.</div></div><hr />

Sylvanas is pretty smart, she may realize killing Genn would escalate the faction conflict more, increasing the chances of her and the Forsaken's death in the long run.</div></div><hr />

It can be explained. I hope she lets Genn go because she does not want to widen the conflict between Horde and Alliance. She is one of the few leaders who actually can use their brain to see the big picture. <br />
<br />
I understand that Genn needs to survive the encounter. Though I still feel a little disappointed since after this encounter nothing changes, so what is the point of this story....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sylvanas is nothing like Garrosh... he went from pathetic, to strong and honourable, to orc hitler. Sylvanas has pretty much always been a bitch, as Garrosh put it so aptly :p she had one moment where she wasn't a total asshole (the Broken Shore) and that was it. Rest has always been vengeance, killing, raising; broadening her meatshield, not wanting to get sent to WoW hell. <br />

The Ysera cinematic was probably one of the prettiest I've seen although can't say I was as moved by that one as I was by the Broken Shore one ... the first time. Now I could care less for that one, too. But then again, can't say I care much for Ysera or even Alexstrasza. Don't care much for women who dress like sluts. I'm glad Sylvanas got a new model to cover her up some more. She's a walking corpse. She shouldn't look like a hooker.<br />
<br />
Sad now the only two Aspects remaining are Nozdormu and Alexstrasza. We lost Malygos in WotLK, Deathwing in Cata, none in MoP or WoD, and now Ysera in Legion. Question is if Nozdormu is next or Alexstrasza. Kalecgos nor Wrathion I count because they're replacements. Also begs the question who's going to replace Ysera now as leader of the green dragon flight. Considering it took from WotLK to Firelands to replace Malygos, Ysera might get a replacement around the middle of the next expansion (one after Legion).</div></div><hr />

I doubt she'll be replaced at all... The &quot;aspects&quot; are gone.. they no longer have their aspect powers which is probably why Ysera was corrupted so easily... Although is becoming apparently that the devs apparently want to kill off all past and present possibly important person or lore character just to push the story forward.. its like the only thing they know how to do.. Personally I'm going to start to wonder what they'll do when they run OUT of &quot;important&quot; people to kill off to push their story forward</div></div><hr />

no one is forcing you to play.<br />

Can someone explain the significance of the val'kyr captured by Sylvanas and what its release means?<br />
<br />
And the music used in the Val'sharah cinematic is Nightsong from Cataclysm. Did this song actually appear in game in Cataclysm, as opposed to just on the soundtrack, (I don't recall it) or is this the first time it's been in the game?<br />
<br />
the golden val'kyr was eyir the current val'kyr queen.<br />
sylvanas wanted to enslave her for endless val'kyr, aka immortality.<br />
<br />
and yes, Nightsong plays in mount hyjal sometimes, well of eternity, teldrassil and ashenvale.<br />

they make you practice your wand on target dummies ... lol wtf is this crap.<br />
<br />
<br />
you dont even have to read the quest to get what is going on, you do their shit because their boss teacher guy has the key to open the door to get the tidestone of gol'ganeth pieces.<br />
<br />
pure logic, you just need a couple of brain cells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, they do. The guy who did it won two Oscars for it.<br />

<br />
Yeah no, those sounds are ripped directly from Jurassic Park.<br />
<br />
They may have been licensed. Or they just created similar sounds. If they copied sounds directly from the movie, Speilberg would now own Blizzard after a massive lawsuit.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard - and WoW lore's, particulary - has some of the best storytelling I've seen in my entire life and trust me, I've seen a bunch of them (game-wise). The fact it didn't went the way you wanted doesn't mean it's bad. Shitloads of story is yet to be told. Be patient and let things unwrap for itself :)<br />
<br />
Well just because only fantasy lore you know is twilight doesn´t mean this is good story telling ;) (oh sorry, game-wise than super mario instead of twilight)<br />

They show her on a good light during the Broken Shore quest chain, from the Horde perspective. Yet now, it seems she's back to her old shenanigans. I really hope they don't do a repeat of Garry. Sylvanas is an opportunity for Blizzard to redeem themselves from the mess that was Garrosh Hellscream's character development.<br />
That's what I took away from the Sylvanas and Genn in-game cinematic as well.</div></div><hr />

My opinion of them did not improve with the shittiest raid patch of all time, Dragonsoul, which was filled with them, their horrible voice acting and cringy writing :pAnd let's not forget 'KALEN, NOOOOOOO'<br />
<br />
Oh man, dragons are so lame.<br />
<br />
Know whats also lame but hilarious to at least observe?<br />
<br />
Butthurt alliance babbus.<br />
<br />
They cry about everything, it's hilarious. Like I'm a pro-alliance pigdog myself (have 10 lvl 100s on alliance and like, one level 60 on horde), but Horde players don't ever seem to get as butthurt as allis do about stuff.<br />

This also is lame, but hilarious to observe.<br />

Blizzard is. In order to play the game I want (raiding) I have to do this mindless shit (questing).Lol get over it. You could go play a game Blizzard doesn't make that doesn't mandate you do some quests to do your true endgame, but you won't, you'll insipidly whine on a comments section, while entirely planning on doing whatever it takes anyway. You're whining for the sake of whining, don't feel bad-- as it's not an uncommon side-effect of being an entitled brat who has to pay 15 dollars a month to complain about shit on the forums with no real intent of ever stopping playing.<br />
<br />
I mean you aren't the only one here doing it, but your example was just an easy one to reach.<br />
<br />
Blizzard isn't forcing you to anything, you're only deciding that raiding is worth whatever comes beforehand, and are choosing to go through stuff you enjoy less to get to stuff you like more.<br />
<br />
Besides, it's not like you have anything else to do until raids actually open in a week from now, anyway. I mean you could go and do something constructive with your life rather than whining that Blizzard is forcing you to play their game, which they're not. I mean you could save yourself 15 USD a week by not letting your delusions of being forced into playing a game override your common sense, but that's too good to let happen, isn't it?<br />

It's good story and you know it.It's okay, but honestly it's not the most appealing on going story, and it's INCREDIBLY generic fantasy stuff.<br />
<br />
What it is as a story is easy to begin on, I personally am a huge Warcraft lore nut, and there definitely are interesting tidbits among, but claiming it as the paragon of on-going storytelling is like saying Chris Metzen is the best voice actor.<br />
<br />
If you think so, sure... that just means you have very low standards.<br />
<br />
Also do you even know what a sheep is in the context you're using it?<br />

Actually the T-Rex in JP was a baby elephant that they recorded in some US zoo... so in a way yes they did record their own dino sounds.The full-blown T-rex roar is indeed something they said they layered several different animal sounds over each other, an elephant, a jaguar's meowll, and some other shit I forget, I think there was some sort of manmade horn in their too, but not the more subdued groan the op is talking about, which is just a stock sound effect. It may have been used in Jurassic Park, but it's not made by them.</div></div><hr />

never played them. do you mean the game has a great story progression or are you talking about the movies and the MMO just happens to live in that world?<br />
because i don't think they are the same thing. but can be great too.</div></div><hr />
