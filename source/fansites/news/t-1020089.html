Explanation of 4.3 Balance Changes, Part Two<br />
Don’t take this as an announcement that the release of patch 4.3 is imminent. While we have completed a lot of work (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3608419/), it’s just hard to know at this stage when the patch will be ready. Nothing is set in stone until the actual patch, and even then we still have the ability to hotfix any major problems that we missed or caused.<br />
<br />
First, here is the link to Part One (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3615095) of our balance explanations. We’ll discuss additional changes below.<br />
<br />
In particular, you may want to pay attention to my comments about rates of change (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3435893). While we do overhaul mechanics when we think it’s warranted, we try to save as many of those as possible for expansions. As exhilarating as it can be for players who log in regularly to suddenly be able to look at a talent or spell in a different light, it can also be frustrating for players who maybe took a break in between patch 4.2 and 4.3 to have to relearn rotations or re-gem their character. In particular, we try to be really conservative when buffing spec B of a class upwards to compete with spec A of the same class. We have gotten it wrong before, and forced a large number of players to swap specs. Ideally we want you to play the spec you enjoy the most and not the one that does the highest DPS, but asking you to continually swap specs to achieve that highest DPS is an unreasonable thing for us to ask.<br />
<br />
Mortal Strike (and similar debuffs)<br />
We dropped the healing debuff from 50% to 10% some time ago, but were convinced at 10% that it was hard to appreciate the effect at all. We want to try Mortal Strike et al. at 25% to see if it feels useful but not mandatory. If 25% is too much and 10% is too little, then it may mean the entire mechanic may not have much of a future. We decided to only change the debuff for the warrior, rogue, and hunter, restoring the original relationship between “strong” and “weak” MS that we had in Lich King.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..deathknight))<br />
We decided not to prevent or discourage block capping for paladins and warriors, because it would have required several corresponding changes to compensate for such severe nerfs and the risk of getting things wrong or asking players to change gear was just too great. Instead, we decided to buff DK and druid tanks to improve their ability to handle streaks of bad luck. In the DK’s case, we increased the armor bonus of Blood Presence.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..druid))<br />
As mentioned above, we increased the Stamina bonus of bear form in order to reduce the chance of tanks being killed too quickly by bad luck. We also changed the armor bonus for bears at lower levels by removing the mechanic that mimicked the warrior and paladin transition from mail to plate. Bears were having difficulty surviving in low-level dungeons, which honestly we don’t want to be that challenging. The armor change should not affect end-game tank balance. We changed the Glyph of Shred so that Feral druids wouldn’t need to vary their rotation in situations where they could not Shred (such as on Ultraxion). We changed the pushback on Cyclone because we decided that it was appropriate for DPS casters to not have pushback protection on heals, and for healers to not have pushback protection on nukes, but that utility spells should be protected for both roles. This will be a small PvP buff for caster druids.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..hunter))<br />
We provided a modest DPS buff for Beast Mastery and Survival hunters to help them catch up with the Marksman spec. As I mentioned above, we wouldn’t consider it a success if we made every Marks hunter respec to Survival, so our intent is to get close without going over. BM also suffers from a lack of AE damage, so we increased the damage of two of their AE pets.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..mage))<br />
We offered some buffs to Fire mages to help them compete with Arcane. Frost is viable in PvE, but at high-end raiding we understand that its damage isn’t perceived as comparable to Arcane or Fire. The problem is that Frost has a lot of control and survivability, and if their damage were also identical, there would be no reason to choose Arcane or Fire. Note that the 5.0 talent design is partially to fix this specific problem, where specs have either higher DPS or higher utility.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..paladin))<br />
We continued to adjust Holy Radiance for its new 4.3 design. We want paladins to be a viable group healer without suddenly becoming far and away the best AE healer. We also want Holy paladins to continue to care about Holy Power and Light of Dawn and not revert to just spamming Holy Radiance. We changed Beacon of Light largely because it was unclear which mechanics were supposed to cause the Beacon transfer. This is a change from our previous design, which allowed Protector of the Innocent and other forms of healing to benefit from Beacon. We want Beacon of Light to remain a powerful spell, and it will be even with these changes, but putting slightly less focus on Beacon will allow paladins to still shine in situations where Beacon isn’t operating at its maximum effectiveness. For Retribution, as we suggested previously, we lowered the crit chance of Hammer of Wrath to reduce burst but increased sustained damage through Two-Handed Specialization and Seal of Truth.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..priest))<br />
Most of our Holy adjustments were discussed in Part One, but we did buff Guardian Spirit to make it more competitive with Pain Suppression. The Shadowform glyph was strictly a quality of life improvement requested by several Shadow priests.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..shaman))<br />
We have slightly unnerfed the initial Wind Shear nerf, but we still want it to be much harder for a healer spec to have such a potent interrupt. Wind Shear (originally Earth Shock) was balanced in the hands of a Resto shaman as a tool for coping with enemy casters in the absence of a magic dispel. While a priest could remove an ally’s Polymorph, the shaman’s only recourse was to prevent it from ever landing in the first place. But in a world where Resto shaman gained the ability to remove magic debuffs, the net result was too potent. We nerfed Elemental’s tier 12 set bonus because it was so powerful that shaman risked passing over their tier 13 set bonus. We increased the passive benefit of Shamanism and Fire Elemental scaling to help compensate for this nerf. There are many other shaman changes discussed in Part One.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..warlock))<br />
We increased Demonology and Destruction’s DPS to be more competitive with Affliction, and increased the duration on Improved Soul Fire to make that buff a bit easier to manage. We also fixed a long-standing bug that caused the Doomguard to do too much damage, so Demo’s buff also needed to offset that.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..warrior))<br />
We believe we have fixed “charge jumping,” where a target who jumped ended up in a different location from the warrior. The warrior should now end up next to the target. We needed to nerf Fury’s DPS slightly to keep them from being ahead of other melee DPS.<br />

<br />
Talking hunter here, 4.3 looks very dark. All melee get 10% buff, Rogues get Legendary Dagger and all casters with some self respect run around with Legendary staff. Wonder what class will be the bottom of the DPS foodchain.<br />
<br />
And why bother doing anything with BM AoE, so you expect them to swap pet when there is a part of a fight where you need to AoE ? Yeah those 2 seconds to dismiss the pet + the global to call a new one, send it to the targets, and then another 2 seconds to dismiss AoE pet and then another global to call back your main dps pet will surely be awesome !<br />
<br />
How about you make Multishot cost a LOT less focus, or do a LOT more damage, so we ain't forced to save Rapid fire for it so we actually have some AoE that last more than a few seconds before you need to rebuild a full focus bar.</div></div><hr />

Couldnt they add some scaling debuff that helps to ramp up their dps? That wouldnt be so bursty in pvp but could let to better scaling in long term dps.<br />
Something like X frost damage every Y seconds per stack, up to 5 (or 10) stacks on the target, applyed by Frostbolt. Make it scale with crit and haste and you just gave a non-burst dps buff to frost mages.<br />

<br />
<br />
I think the issue with Mortal Strike (Warriors) in Wrath was not MS itself, but the Overpower talent we got as well. It allowed a Warrior to basicly kill a Healers healing done (To the healer) by 75% if you could hit the over power during the cast (Which wasn't hard to do with any healer except Druids). <br />
<br />
I do agree that a 40% nerf to compesate was a bad idea, and upping it by 15% now isn't a good idea either. But they needed to look at the over all abilities that can potentially reduce healing done or recieved.</div></div><hr />

Notice the WILL be. Notice what you linked is from this tier and without Legendarys, I'm talking 4.3 and tier13.<br />
<br />
Now calculate in a 10% dmg buff to ALL melee and Legendary daggers+staffs and check again where MM Hunters will be (and BM/Survival will still be below)</div></div><hr />

As a Frost DK in 80% bis gear, it's still a challenge with a comparable fury warrior :P<br />
<br />
I am super excited for the DK changes, even if they're bandaid tank fixes. They're welcomed none the less.</div></div><hr />

Probably the same thing people dislike about Frost DK, when you don't get lucky, that burst turns into falling on your face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
imo combat is much more fun than mutilate. in combat at least you are constantly using gcds instead of waiting for energy to recharge. i would love for sub to be brought closer in line with the other 2 specs, but position reqs of backstab and ambush can make the spec useless on some encounters.<br />
<br />
anyways, i get the feeling that blizz thinks rogues are pretty balanced pve wise and i agree with that for the most part. im sure if even with the daggers rogues struggle for what ever reason (doubtful) there will be hotfixes.<br />
<br />
pvp on the other hand i feel is a whole nother beast. i think the change to the ms on wound poison will be a nice little buff, but i would really like to a boost in dmg output outside of shadowdance, like possibly a buff to hemo and backstab, that is only accessible to sub builds so it wont effect assassination once it gets into its execute range.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beet</div><div class="date">2011-11-11, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man I was so happy I had completely forgotten about the fact that fury warriors were getting that 5% damage nerf. Pretty freaking disappointing especially looking at http://www.simulationcraft.org/430/Raid_T12H.html which makes me think we really were not in need of this nerf at all. I was really hoping deep down that Arms would get a buff for 4.3 but I guess that won't happen now. And no I don't mean in PVP. It would just be nice for arms to be even with fury or even better for at least a couple months. I can barely remember the few times that's happened. I do feel you hunter's pain though. When everyone is geared for tier 13 you're going to be pretty far down the totem pole. It's always a real shame when a pure dps class ends up in a situation like that. <br />
Mutilate 14th best spec and rogues are smashing PvE huh? Sure combat is 4th with cleave. But alot of rogues think combat is boring as hell. Oh please. At least you've got multiple specs you can play that do are all viable in some encounters. As a warrior fury has been our only viable pve spec for 3/4th of our history in WoW including right now.</div></div><hr />

As I mentioned above, we wouldn’t consider it a success if we made every Marks hunter respec to Survival, so our intent is to get close without going over. BM also suffers from a lack of AE damage, so we increased the damage of two of their AE pets. Yeah... who cares that mm will be shit in 4.3 compared to all casters,hybrids and melee thx to their 10% ap buff... <br />
Warlock (Forums / Talent Calculator / Skills/Talents) We increased Demonology and Destruction’s DPS to be more competitive with Affliction, and increased the duration on Improved Soul Fire to make that buff a bit easier to manage. We also fixed a long-standing bug that caused the Doomguard to do too much damage, so Demo’s buff also needed to offset that. Affli is the highest dps specc atm so you pump up other 2 lock speccs to lvl of afflicition but 2 hunter specc you pump up to lvl of mm even tugh mm is miles behind affli and we are talking about 2 pure dps classes here <br />

7 bosses every 3-4 months or 12 bosses every year? We are getting more content faster. We've been getting it. Instead we get less bosses. If you want 14 bosses cool. But i rather not do the same raid for a year. 7 bosses in half the time is cooler for me.<br />

There was never a change intended for combat to use a dagger in the MH, there is only a change intended for combat to specifically use the legendary daggers. Which is a tweak on the dagger end, not the rogue end.<br />

Blizzard is getting ridiculous in how they are handling them, the dozens of question they got asked about them and all they can muster up is a non-answer. I really don't care about resto blizz, stop talking about wind shear and start telling us how you are dealing with ele shaman. As of now (last I checked the math behind it too) an ele shaman loses ~1600 dps just from 4.3 vs 4.2. While making 2pt12 useless it makes us reliant on our 10min cd like t11 (every other fight you are optimal, like demo now), but not only that its buffed from 50% sp to 55% sp. So we now will have even larger changes in our dps per attempt. /sighI assume other elemental shamans have a similar feel.</div></div><hr />

Well... The FACT is that if you are good at playing a hunter you will obviously do very good with it. The korean kids who won the blizzcon tournament is living proof of that. Its easier to choose fotm-classes/comps and succeed with that ofcourse. MLS as an example. <br />
<br />
But whats the fun in that? Its more awesome to play an underdog spec/class. Atleast for me.<br />

Hardly. The skills combined from the hunter, dk and paladin was the winning factor. They learned how to play with a non-fotm class/spec<br />

Note that the 5.0 talent design is partially to fix this specific problem, where specs have either higher DPS or higher utility.<br />
<br />
Thats a pretty poor excuse. They have tried everything to buff Frost. First T13 4P reduced cooldown on Icy Veins by 60, then by 100 and now by 150 seconds (Icy Veins cooldown only lasts 144 seconds). T13H BiS with T12H 4p is better than T13h 4p. That´s a damn bad joke. Viable? Really? T13H Fire DTR is 12k DPS ahead Frost DTR (First SimCs). T12H 4.3 Fire is ahead T12H DTR Frost. Lets talk about &quot;control and survivability:&quot; Cauterize &gt; Ice Barrier in PvE. I never used Frostnova, Shattered Barrier, Reactive Barrier or Improved Cone of Cold in Firelands nor would I in DS. That´s just stupefaction of the people!

Wind Shear (originally Earth Shock) was balanced in the hands of a Resto shaman as a tool for coping with enemy casters in the absence of a magic dispel. While a priest could remove an ally’s Polymorph, the shaman’s only recourse was to prevent it from ever landing in the first place. But in a world where Resto shaman gained the ability to remove magic debuffs, the net result was too potent. If the issue of Wind Shear is centered around not having Resto shamans be able to interrupt AND dispel (when originally they could only interrupt, not dispel), why not make Wind Shear nerfed or unavailable for only Resto spec, but have it stay the same for Enhance and Ele, who can't dispel magic? Unless I misunderstand, wouldn't that be easier and more balanced for everyone? Because as I understand it, Wind Shear is to be nerfed for everyone :confused:</div></div><hr />

The legendary daggers are just a band-aid fix on what is a vanishing class, they have even said that throwing the class a legendary isn't going to change to set in stone view on &quot;Don't bring the class that gives nothing&quot;, and since that change is for further on we get stuck with little to nothing that needs to be tweak before the big changes they have plan.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the after patch balance hotfixes that will come with the legendary daggers being too powerful for either<br />
1) PvE<br />
2) PvP<br />
3) One spec preforming miles ahead of the others with the daggers.<br />
<br />
So for now the rogue balance changes are in hiding for thier incoming fixes with the legendary that will &quot;fix&quot; everything.</div></div><hr />

Back when they gave us no info at all, people complained that Blizzard never explained the intent behind any of the changes they made.<br />
When they gave us some info, people complained that they weren't giving us enough info.<br />
Now that they make huge in-depth posts explaining exactly where they're coming from, you complain that you don't like their reasoning.<br />
<br />
I can understand people not agreeing with a reason behind a particular change, but surely there's a better way to articulate your dissatisfaction than throwing all of your toys out of the pram.</div></div><hr />
