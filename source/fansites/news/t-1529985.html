Warlords of Draenor - Dark Portal<br />
The Dark Portal model that is located in Draenor appears to still be in progress, as it is missing textures for most of the model, but it does have an interesting addition compared to the Outland version. <br />
<br />
The Draenor version of the Dark Portal has a small room under it that may be related to the Gul'dan's Prison (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/34393-guldans-prison) quest, which mentions Gul'dan (http://wowpedia.org/Gul%27dan) being held below the Dark Portal to power it. If you are interested in the quests that involve the Draenor Dark Portal, take a look at the early preview of the intro experience quest line (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3960-Warlords-of-Draenor-Quest-Preview-May-2-Hotfixes-Blue-Tweets-Classic-Games-Art).<br />
<br />
Build 18297 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4010-Warlords-of-Draenor-Alpha-Build-18297) also added a red version of the Dark Portal in Outland, which currently isn't being used anywhere. There is also some nice Fan Art (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1529492-%28Mock-up%29-WoD-Login-Screen-UDK4-0) that uses it to make a login screen.<br />

<br />
Patch 5.4.8 Hotfixes - June 3<br />
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br />
<br />
Siege of Orgrimmar<br />
<br />
Resolved an issue where Kor'kron Shaman's Treasure (http://www.wowdb.com/items/105751-korkron-shamans-treasure) was not dropping in Flexible difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds and Arenas<br />
<br />
Ethereal Soul-Trader can no longer be summoned while in an Arena or Battleground.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Also, I think it's being suggested that in high end raiding, choice in talent in that tier is an illusion.<br />
For (literally) the top 0.1% of players, it's a non-choice. For the rest, it's a way to customize the feel of the rotation. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471326044591374337))<br />
Is that the top 0.1% of raiders or all players? Raiders as those seeing the content.<br />
The &quot;content&quot; in this case is the talent tiers themselves, no? In which case they are relevant to everyone. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471336303368216576))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
If we've deleted certain toys in the past will they still appear in the toybox? (due to having the Q completed) I.e: Marmot<br />
We hope to, but are unsure what form that will take. (Source (https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/473875411038789634))<br />
<br />
Are drop rates going to be higher to compensate for gear changing stats and the same item being usable by more people?<br />
Drop chances and treasure table structure are both going under the knife for some upgrades to account for the new paradigms. (Source (https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/473981369807159296))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
What are your thoughts on Challenge modes being cheesed by use of Invis pots?<br />
Invis pots are the counterbalance for Shroud of Concealment. Otherwise rogue would be mandatory. Mob kill count keeps it sane. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471342739783548928))<br />
<br />
Since CMs will still downscale gear, and therefore still be challenging, could their loot tables improve each tier?<br />
Quite possibly, yes, but it's too early to make a definite call on that. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471336816709099520))<br />
I thought the plan was later patches have new dungeons + old dungeons scale up to remain relevant (to avoid burnout)<br />
That's what we'd discussed. Scaling up CM gear rewards as new tiers unlock is a separate question entirely. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471344046456455168))<br />
<br />
Free Faction Change<br />
Question. Why free transfer to alliance for faster queue when after doing so horde queues will be fast again? Defeats the purpose?<br />
Queue length is not the primary reason people transfer. Cost is the primary reason they don't. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/471312343314362368))<br />
<br />
Servers/Cross servers NEED to be faction balanced. PvP servers/players DO NOT want a server with a dead opposite faction = boring.<br />
Ironically PvE servers have great faction ratios. PvP servers are the ones that have trended towards imbalance. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/471312715571400706))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
is blizzard working toward anything to stop DDOS or compensating for it, especially in the rbg environment?<br />
DDOS attacks occur outside the realm of control of Blizzard. I recommend you do not use programs that make your IP address known. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469724872948477953))<br />
<br />
Just wondering what Bliizard's opinion is on Horde in Isle of Conquest?<br />
I think Horde avoid it or give up too easily. They used to win it handily. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469911385552744448))<br />
<br />
Any chance the base wow arena Tournament UI getting revamped soon? No life bars over characters is hard to follow.<br />
We have discussed ways to improve including low hanging fruit like nameplates and reducing number of buffs, damage/healing numbers. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/470415052638404608))<br />
<br />
Are honor/cp rewards staying the same for random BGs in WoD, or are we switching to only drops?<br />
Random BG/Call to Arms won't give an honor bonus anymore. It will be strong boxes. So today's system with a different bonus. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/470623712274690048))<br />
<br />
It is my impression that damage, in PvP, scales twice as fast as healing, because there are generally two DPS per Healer. True?<br />
False. Those scale in parallel; no net scaling difference. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470781494181380097))<br />
<br />
with long fears being reduced to 6 seconds, will you address sap, as it's a indirect nerf to sap and its function?<br />
no plans to change sap (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/471319283507552256))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
so gathering profs are largely irrelevant with farming in MoP, any interest in making a secondary 'gathering' slot?<br />
Something we have considered, but we'll just be focusing on making gathering useful this time around. (Source (https://twitter.com/TheCrafticus/status/470775692939247616))<br />
<br />
New Jumper cables and Army knife, no engineering requirement on them? What's the point in being an engineer now?<br />
Knife has a requirement now. We decided against the other cables. (Source (https://twitter.com/TheCrafticus/status/471066449914912768))<br />
so new knife, Eng can combat res? (please say yes) if it fails (or not anymore?) would consume a res charge or not?<br />
Not a combat rez, but will work 100% of the time. Side effects on the engineer may still occur.<br />
<br />
Pets and Pet Battles<br />
Could we get a sneak peek of one of those very cool bonuses? <br />
Here ya go: We will be introducing a new type of battle pet stone that grants levels to pets instead of quality. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/472061474836201472))<br />

Doubleagent - Level 89 Neutral Pandaren<br />
Doubleagent (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/mannoroth/Doubleagent/simple), the Neutral Pandaren has finally hit level 89!

It's some guy who's been leveling his pandaren entirely on herbing and mining. He's never left the Wandering Isle and he's never chosen a faction.</div></div><hr />

I actually think that, he will get the alliance-based achievement once hitting lvl 90. I believe that's the default file for Pandaren.</div></div><hr />

Uhhh, I'm assuming this means RBG? I don't know why they did this either way, it's just a pet. I'm thinking maybe because of the pots that allow you to see invisibility? Were you able to buy them inside the arena/RBG and use them as oppose to buying them outside and not being able to use them inside? I hope I can still use mine in a normal BG because after you kill people it shoots a gigantic, super long-range purple beam at their body and gives you their soul.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol...whatever the reason is...it's Blizz own fault. They didn't stop the duping and now it's that cheap that almost anyone that wants one got one.<br />
<br />
<br />
*Just wondering what Bliizard's opinion is on Horde in Isle of Conquest?<br />
I think Horde avoid it or give up too easily. They used to win it handily.*<br />
<br />
Same in AV. They used to win it...but meta changed and the Horde is exactly as lazy as the alliance(and it's a bit odd to think they should work harder for the win than alliance does) and as a result of the uneven map design alliance wins now. Can't blame the horde...neither can you blame the alliance for losing arathi and mines. <br />
Check out how much Strand of the Ancients win rates changed since they cut the advantage of alliance by giving factions a random starting position.</div></div><hr />

And the funny thing: Blizz can't catch the bots. I mean, bots are always quite visible cause they run the exact same path as a group....but in IoC it's borderline ridiculous. I mean those bots wait in the beginning till the front gate closes and then use the teleporter to get out(nobody, I mean NOBODY with a working brain does that)....it's so obvious that they could paint &quot;BOT&quot; all over their char!</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. If they give 1 faction a free mount and not the other a huge uproar would happen!<br />
<br />
2. Does anyone remember what happened in Cataclysm when Goblins got 2 bikes and they decided to half ass Worgens and not give them a mount? Yeah the Alliance cried up a storm over the fact the Horde had 2 extra mounts and they didn't and that prompted Blizzard to throw them 2 horses just to shut them up! <br />
<br />
3. Would Blizzard be dumb enough to give an Alliance bike to a horde character or vice versa? What do you think Garrosh or Varian would think if they saw that thing come rolling into Org or Stormwind?? They would throw a temper tantrum and smash that piece of junk to pieces! <br />
<br />
4. Charging us money for 1 bike and not the other? Who the hell is going to pay for a mount that doesn't even fly!? I call BS on that! <br />
<br />
5. That is a lot of work put into those machines and only 1 bike make it in? I'd be pretty upset if I were Paul's crew if that's the case! <br />
<br />
6. I find the voting will end up being pretty biased and unfair because not only does this game have more Alliance players but people aren't even going to vote for which bike genuinely looks better! They are voting for the faction they play!</div></div><hr />

There is approx 16mil XP required from level 89-90 right? If he is only getting 20-30 xp PER herb/mineral that doesnt seem feesible. MATH=<br />
<br />
16mil xp / approx 25 xp per herb = 640k herbs.<br />
<br />
640k herbs * approx 5 sec per gather = 3.2 mil seconds<br />
<br />
3.2 mil seconds = 37 days. (actual play time)<br />

Seems impossible! and that is only from level 89-90...</div></div><hr />

He is also completing dungeons and raids, not sure how with no faction, maybe it just queues you up for both.?</div></div><hr />

Blizzards stance toward bots at this point is pathetic. They used to be known for one of the better companies at policing bots. Now I have to think they are getting monetary kickbacks from the bot makers/gold farmers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought from an earlier post that he was leveling by doing daily pet battle quests on other character and then completing them on the Panda. I don't think he is doing any dungeons and raids, or at least the gear on his armory page is all stuff that can be made/enchanted by tier-1 professions from the island.<br />
<br />
If he could complete dungeons/raids, he would have been 90 twelve months ago.</div></div><hr />

The recent activity is from the players alts, which others have already explained earlier! ;) Check any of your own characters in the Armory, they should all show the exact same recent activity, in other words it's account-wide recent activity, not character specific recent activity.<br />
<br />
As for the gear, my guess would be that other players on Wandering Isle have simply given or sold those items to Doubleagent.</div></div><hr />

It's a bug. Here's my alt for example who is 65 and shouldn't be able to do them either.<br />

He can't leave panda starting zone, but correctly leveled herbs give you XP like normal.</div></div><hr />

It appears there is more going on than I thought. I'll have to wait for the release to not know as much.</div></div><hr />
