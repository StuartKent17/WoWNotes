Cho'gall Heroic World 2nd Kill by Paragon<br />
Paragon (http://www.paragon.fi/) also killed Cho'gall in Heroic Mode during the week-end and reached Lady Sinestra, the heroic only encounter of the Bastion of Twilight, things might get interesting very soon. To this date, Paragon (http://www.paragon.fi/) is the only guild with 11 Heroic boss kills in Cataclysm, followed by For The Horde (http://manaflask.com/) with 10 kills. <br />

Addon Review - Quest Completist (by Shamanic (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/572399-Shamanic))<br />
This addon, created by Viduus of Frostmane EU is a quest tracker/finder updated for Cataclysm, allowing you to track all the quests you have completed - and which ones you have yet to complete.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quest Completist at Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/quest_completist.aspx)<br />
<br />
<br />
Using this Addon<br />
In order to bring up the console you type /qc<br />
<br />
The first thing you want to do is &quot;Perform Server Query&quot; by clicking on &quot;Zones&quot; and it's the final option. This will update to the addon which quests you have already completed. You will need to give the client a minute or two to get all the data but this only needs to be done once.<br />
<br />
You will most likely want to select &quot;Hide Opposing Forces Quests&quot; in order to only see quests available to your faction. <br />
<br />
Now you can select your zone, including Zones, Dungeons &amp; Raids, Professions, Classes etc. When you open the console, the zone listed will be the one that you are standing in, if you are travelling through zones the console will automatically switch, making it very easy to find the quests for the area you're currently in. The total number of quests found is displayed on the bottom right. If you want to track which quests you have not already completed you can tick &quot;Hide Completed Quests&quot;. Now only quests you have not completed are shown. Quests you are already on are marked with a question mark, and quests you have completed but not yet turned in would be highlighed yellow.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/january/Jv7px.jpg<br />
<br />
An excellent feature is the listing of daily quests. See for example Twilight Highlands. This allows you to keep track of which zones have daily quests. Hovering over the quest will give you information including quest text, objectives, quest giver and the co-ordinates. The addon offers TomTom support.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/january/qIoOu.jpg<br />
<br />
It is a work in progress and you can help the addon author keep this addon updated by sending your Saved Variable file found in \WTF\Account\&lt;account name=&quot;&quot;&gt;Saved Variables\QuestCompletist.lua to viduus.wow@gmail.com<br />
<br />
Conclusion: This is a very simple addon with an attractive user interface with a one click setup (query server) required, overall a very easy to use and useful tool for quest hunters and loremasters.<br />

Revenge: Marrowgar Solo Kill by Raegwyn<br />
You probably heard Raegwyn's name a few times in the past, he's that crazy Death Knight who likes to solo stuff that people aren't really supposed to kill alone in the first place. Last time he tried to kill Marrowgar it ended fairly painfully (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smobcoXPT6Y) because of the enrage timer but things are now very different with 5 extra levels...<br />

Anyhow, nice with even more competition, with Paragon being 11/12, FTH being 10/12 but with Cho'gall killed. Looking forward to the Sinestra-race ;)</div></div><hr />

I quite honestly expect Bliz to implement something like QC in the near future in the default game. It's just convenient to see what quests remain in a zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The top guild from the previous raiding tier (aka Paragon in ICC) and EU guilds in general, have always gotten better front page treatment. Its subtle enough that its not a problem, but anyone that claims it has always been 100% unbiased has not been following for very long. Whenever a new guild gets the most valued world first-kill of the current tier, theyll get the special treatment too.</div></div><hr />

In fact, most of the 2nds I recall were either EU/US firsts or the final bosses leading up to the last boss in a tier. Until she goes down pretty much every guild that has a reasonable shot of being first making another step towards it is newsworthy. The announcements aren't *just* about patting people on the back for doing it. I don't have a horse in the race, and I'm not cheering anyone in particular (although I do know who I'm not cheering for at this point), but I'm still interested to see how it plays out. Since I don't care enough to lurk other people's guild sites, MMO-Champ is probably the only place I would hear about it.</div></div><hr />

The reason he posts it is because now TWO guilds have unlocked Sinestra, the supposedly uber-hardmode-boss and therefore there is some REALLY interesting competiton starting right now between Paragon and FTH.<br />

<br />
Can you not read? Paragon is the FIRST guild to down 11 of the Heroic Cata Bosses while FTH only has 10 down. That is why he brought up Paragon's name is because they are the CLOSEST to downing all of the Heroic Cata bosses. Also, someone also brought up another obvious reason... They are guilds competing against each other to down Sinestra and it is interesting to see which one will get the job done first. So he noted that FTH has 10/12 and Paragon has 11/12 to make us aware of the competition. NO ONE EVER said that FTH did not get the World First. They got their front page post about their kill and they got their glory. Get over it you're just mad you can't be in a guild that is sooo close to conquering the last encounter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, get over yourself already.<br />
<br />
This is not about idolizing you guys but keeping people informed who are interested in that (cutting edge progression).<br />
Sometimes it is interesting who has the second, or even the third kill, sometimes it is not.<br />
<br />
One example would be just to stress how much better the guild must have been that got it first because the second kill happened much later.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side-note:<br />
I thought you did most of the publicity stuff for FTH. Given a comment like that, you seem to be the wrong person for that position.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I thought this was just a single slip, but then I read your posting history here... I advise everybody to do the same.<br />

<br />
This is not about idolizing you guys but keeping people informed who are interested in that (cutting edge progression).<br />
Sometimes it is interesting who has the second, or even the third kill, sometimes it is not.<br />
<br />
One example would be just to stress how much better the guild must have been that got it first because the second kill happened much later.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side-note:<br />
I thought you did most of the publicity stuff for FTH. Given a comment like that, you seem to be the wrong person for that position.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I thought this was just a single slip, but then I read your posting history here... I advise everybody to do the same.<br />
I wouldn't judge your whole guild for your behavior, but others surely will.<br />
<br />
I'm actually inclined to agree with this guy, but this is more on the publicity side. I've looked over Tyranias last posts, and it seems like there almost is another guy typing the last ones. While i do not understand german and hence dont know what he wrote before, it feels like he's the archetype of an elitist, and then i dont mean in a good way. Calling people idiots, mocking them for not being as fast as he is, among other things. Sure, For the horde is a great guild and all, but the way this guy is acting, is everyone like him? This just leaves a bitter aftertaste to them being world first to unlock Sinestra, if they're all like this guy. I sure hope others in FTH aint. <br />
<br />
Btw. I can only make it stronger, check this guys last.. 5 or 6 posts. That's where i'm juding from, and not before.</div></div><hr />

and I love that addon<br />
<br />
and Hunters have already soloed that dude a long time now<br />
<br />
and 1 Hunter have also soloed Heroic Vortex Pinnacle<br />
<br />
Which means that currently its Hunter 1 and DK 0 since all that DKs can solo is possible for a Hunter also, but we have soloed Heroic Vortex Pinnacle also. And u guys havent.<br />

<br />
The point why Boub announced Paragons world 2nd, was because now there is a race to kill Sinestria first, between them and FTH.<br />
Second, Paragon has killed 11/12 bosses in heroic 25, while FTH, still having a Cho'Gall first, only has completed 10/12. <br />
Hence, Paragon has the chance of being the first guild to reach all bosses killed in Heroic, while FTH still has to kill Sinestria and one more to do the same feat. (Which one FTH has to kill more, i dont know.)<br />
<br />
(I'm sure someone else has already said this, but i'll just clarify it again.)<br />

<br />
I think the relevance is that he had attempted it at lvl 80 and was only beaten by the enrage timer. I don't know of an hunter that can boast the same. I haven't attempted this, but I still think it a 'cool' thing to have done.<br />
<br />
As for Paragon kill, it is news. News belongs on a news website, of which mmo-champ is. True, if I'm an avid follower of Paragon's progress, I can read it on their website, but I come to mmo-champ because someone has done that for me and presented the news to me quickly. Paragon world second is topical and worthy of reporting. Like someone said above, it highlights that there are now 2 guilds in the running for Sinestra.</div></div><hr />

And because Paragon had Blizz nerf Darkflight because those prema donna's wanted to make sure their chosen faction was always the top raid comp. Give For the Horde the respect they deserve, because with this post about Paragon you're spitting on them.<br />

Bad way to speak to the guy who can ban you here like that. So what if Darkflight was nerfed, it is still great. Watch your tongue next time, I highly say no to talking to people like that.</div></div><hr />

Not once was it mentioned that he did it for a world first.<br />

The reason it is mentioned is because now paragon is leading in terms of kills. Get it? Not becasue they managed to kill a boss 2nd, but because they took the 1st place by killing 1 more boss than anyone else.

<br />
I'm going to go ahead and summarize what many others have said that justifies this post.<br />
<br />
1) It's not about getting world 2nd, it's about another guild being eligible to defeat the final heroic-only boss and creates interesting competition.<br />
2) Paragon is now 11/12, while FTH is only 10/12. Paragon is the top guild right now in terms of boss kills. It's just a fact.<br />
<br />
You need to relax.<br />
<br />
<br />
And Thalendil, what is the title supposed to say? It's just a fact that they got world 2nd and is mentioned because he primarily wanted to mention the new competition for the new boss. You also need to relax.</div></div><hr />

It's world FIRST to be 11/12. That's world first. Yes, they were the second to kill that particular boss, the point is to show which guilds are currently leading and the state of affairs. Without listing this means an inaccurate description of the current state of affairs (which is that paragon is ahead.) Get over it.</div></div><hr />

If people were as committed to actual useful things (i.e. curing diseases, saving lives, just generally helping people...) instead of being retarded and rushing to beat a game the world would be a way better place. Instead we have basement dwellers feeling proud in the useless accomplishment of beating an online boss first which only applies to real life in the realization 5-10 years later that they are/were pathetic losers.<br />
<br />
I didn't go through beta testing and waste/rush through countless hours to make this &quot;useless post&quot; so it would be dumb to say QQing/bitching like this is anywhere near as bad as what these losers do (pre-emptive strike at other losers that will try to justify their countless hours wasted by just saying I'm jealous or that whining here makes me no better).

Well generally a title reflects what an article is mainly about. If he 'primarily wanted to mention the new competition for the new boss,' why isn't the title 'Paragon unlocks Sinestra'?<br />

and fth are maybe the 2nd best guild atm but believe me if this raid would be linear and not three different raids then no guild would have a shot for a world first kill.<br />
I am not a a fanboy but realistic and Paragon play atm just better, greater strategys and near to perfect execution. <br />
They failed with Cho Gall because they underestimated Fth and beat Chogall like under 24 hrs after fth, so they could get him easily first <br />
<br />
So beat it</div></div><hr />

That addon looks good.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just slow today, but I can't figure out how to get the addon to display only the daily quests for a given zone, like the author shows in the final screenshot. Can anyone help me with that?</div></div><hr />

If people were as committed to actual useful things (i.e. curing diseases, saving lives, just generally helping people...) instead of being retarded and rushing to beat a game the world would be a way better place. Instead we have basement dwellers feeling proud in the useless accomplishment of beating an online boss first which only applies to real life in the realization 5-10 years later that they are/were pathetic losers.<br />
<br />
I didn't go through beta testing and waste/rush through countless hours to make this &quot;useless post&quot; so it would be dumb to say QQing/bitching like this is anywhere near as bad as what these losers do (pre-emptive strike at other losers that will try to justify their countless hours wasted by just saying I'm jealous or that whining here makes me no better). It's not a problem to play a game but when you make it more then just that (a game for free time) you need to think about your priorities in life.<br />
<br />
I assure you there are maybe around 1000 people who do raid hardcore and race for world first kills,most of them attend school or study,they got enough free time to do that they do,they can also not attend school/university for 1-2 weeks without getting heat.Another part of hardcore gamers are people who do work but the kind of work they do does not require any special dedication or extra hours and has free work schedule,f.e.IT-branche.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actual useful things&quot; will never belong to hardcore gamers category,because if you want to &quot;cure deseases&quot; and &quot;save lifes&quot; you couldnt spend your free time completely apart from job because sooner or later you would get emergency calls which accidentally would brake any kind of raiding schedule.<br />
<br />
However maybe some of the hardcore raiders who are attending school will become doctor,nurse or member of rescue team,fire emergency etc.<br />
<br />
I also would like to point out that professional sportsmen dont save anyones lives in their training time as well maybe you should flame them too.</div></div><hr />

Ensidia fanboys are Paragon fanboys because most of them migrate to whatever is currently the best. The rest of the people simply don't care about these guilds and post about it. They're entitled to their opinions, much like you are. Let moderation sort them out.</div></div><hr />

This is more relevent since paragon maintains a 1 kill lead on clearing all content.</div></div><hr />

Please stop posting non-sense already, you cant even count to 13. Well, wowprogress dot com finally updated the digit.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think abusing game mechanics to greatly simplify an encounter was rewarded with a 72hours relaxation back in time. Remember some of the final encounters like Yogg-Saron-0 or the Lich King where guilds have been suspended for three days after a &quot;world first kill&quot; plus undoing.<br />
<br />
These days though you can take an awesome screenshot making fun of how easy a specific encounter gets by changing your raid line-up &quot;slightly&quot; and Blizzard is stunned by all that glory. I am not insulting Paragon for getting their shot on Nef, but asking the community about Blizzard's decisions regarding final bosses.<br />
<br />
Either you respect guilds for abusing stuff and hence admit those &quot;faults in boss designs&quot;, or you undo the whole kill (including drops) like you did with Ensidia in WotLK.<br />
<br />
What is your opinions on the bug kills by Exodus (Yogg-0), Ensidia (Lich King normal) and Paragon (Nefarian).<br />
Do NOT judge guilds, argue on decision making please!</div></div><hr />

Just as clarification, the video is rendered at what looks like 2x-3x speed. The new Rune system followed by the Death Strike healing nerfs put things on more of an even scale. <br />
<br />
I don't know that he's healing any more than, say, a Protadin with a WoG spec.</div></div><hr />

im glad that in these times there is no possibility at all to edit a video to an extent that it cant be faked in no way whatsoever.<br />
<br />
the excuse &quot;we dont post videos bcus we dont want other top tier raiding guilds to geta chance of frists&quot; is just crap on a stick, do you really think that these guilds do not more likely know like nearly everything that there is to know about these encounters? do you really think that posting a 1st kill video of any boss would affeckt the speed in that a guild like FtH or whatever bcus they saw how you did it? yea it would .... if one guild didnt know the bug then yea it would....<br />
<br />
<br />
if you really think all the &quot;so called&quot; pro guilds could simply just post theyre combatlogs in the moment theyre putting up the news on theyre pages... but guess now why they dont do it...</div></div><hr />

Obviously yes, otherwice all top tier raiding guilds would have killed em already, if they knew everything about the encounters and utilize it properly ? They have tactic, they see how other ppl did it succesfully, they add some elements to their tactic and kill the boss ding ding ding!</div></div><hr />
