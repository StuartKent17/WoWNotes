<br />
<br />
Keep Your Feet on the Ground and Something Valuable, Perhaps? - The quest chain starts in front of the Stormwind Embassy and sends you to Dun Morough to investigate a care. You find a tablet and bring it to Brann Bronzebeard in Ironforge.<br />
Ancient Armor, Ancient Mystery, Watch Your Back, Madoran's Study, and Shards of the Past - The tablet tells of the Bulwark of the Mountain King, ancient dwarven armor that you find out Madoran Bronzebeard wore in the past. You enter old Ironforge with Advisor Belgrum, take out some troggs, and enter Madoran's study to retrieve the shards of the armor.<br />
Interest Yah in a Pint? - You then head to Loch Modan and speak with Grumnus Steelshaper to discover the armor can only be reforged if the Great Forge's flames are made hotter.<br />
Recruiting the Furnace Master and Earthen Blessing - Brann mentions that Ulduar is being rebuilt and Ignis has been revived and sends you to recruit him. After helping Ignis destroy some fire elementals, the forge master agrees to help. You return to Loch Modan and learn from Bouldcrag the Rockshaper that you need to retrieve a piece of Magni's ritual so that your stoneform can withstand the flames.<br />
Forging the Armor and Legacy of the Bronzebeard - After getting a piece of crystal from Magni's ritual in Old Ironforge you and the others assemble at the Great Forge and forge the Bulwark of the Mountain King. You then bring the armor to Muradin and the quest chain ends.<br />

Luckily you can just like buy a tabard and grind it out in like a day.<br />

If you have a 120 Dwarf not exalted with Ironforge, you're simply terrible at life.<br />
<br />
Honestly if you're not exalted with all the cities...you're pretty bad at life. Those are like the easiest exalts outside of simply being a raider during raids with rep lol</div></div><hr />

You needed to be exalted prior to get the Allied Races - and your AR toons start at exalted with their corresponding reputations (Nightborne, etcetera).<br />
Plus, they've been saying that you need to be exalted with Silvermoon/Dwarftown since they've announced these things and that they are race-specific quest chains...<br />

<br />
With Allied race Heritage armour, you need to actively get to level 110. Prior to being able to get your Allied race to 110, you need to get a specific faction to exalted.<br />
<br />
Now, before we even talk about the laughable ease of getting any of the home city reputations to exalted, we have to also realise that NO LEVELLING IS INVOLVED.<br />
You don't have to level 1-120, and if you want heritage armour on your DWARF, what exactly were you planning to do with it? Play him locked at sub 120?<br />
<br />
Non allied race heritage armours are quests, that is it. All you need is your 120 Dwarf to be exalted and then you can start the questline.</div></div><hr />

Oh and on the upside guys BFA is on sale right now! (i think about Â£34 from the store?) You can make a new account and pay to get it upto BFA, this will give you a FREE 110 BOOST you can use on mains account. Why do this you ask? Simple buying a 110 boost cost nearly Â£50 direct from store this will save you some cash.</div></div><hr />

Dwarves aren't an allied race. Besides, all allied races require an exalted reputation to unlock.</div></div><hr />

it seems you just need to be 120, so you are able to use a boost and just level 110-120. seems like it'd actually be quicker and easier than levelling 20-110</div></div><hr />

Considering you can just put the tabard on and grind to exalted in a single day if you just keep running Utgarde Pinnacle over and over and over, I don't think it's THAT big of a deal.</div></div><hr />

This is about as close as you can get to &quot;something for nothing&quot;. City reps take about an hour of running obsolete dungeons to get to Exalted, or you will probably get to Exalted accidently just by levelling to 120.<br />

Just enjoy the bloody heritage armors, you are getting them for free.</div></div><hr />

But this isn't an allied race. This is a core race that's been in the game for 14 years, so it stands to reason that they'll use a different metric than an allied race, which wasn't even available a year ago. And as such, blood elves, gnomes, and tauren will also need to hit exalted with their home city and hit 120.<br />
<br />
I'm not entirely sure why it's such a big deal. If you liked the race enough to play it, odds are that you've either got one at max level already or close to. And even if you're rolling a new toon just for this (for an armor set that, as far as I know, can only be worn on that race), it won't take you long to get to max level, especially with the leveling XP nerfs.</div></div><hr />

I actually agree with what you say. The 110-120 is not a big big deal, i actually have a 120 exalted dwarf to start with can't can't wait to do this quest. So personally it won't affect me. <br />
But in regards to the recent events and the status of Blizzard as a company and BfA atm., it smells like a quick cash grab through timegating with those 10 levels. I might be wrong, but this is just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

I might be wrong, but werenât BE and Dwarf heritage armor and requirements announced before Blizzcon. That of being max level and needing to do a quest line to unlock? As far as I know, the whole being exalted aspect was recently announced which isnât a huge deal as itâs easy to grind out. The addition of being exalted with a faction has no bearing on making Blizz money from a cash shop or in game currency exchange.</div></div><hr />
