<br />
Head Enchants Removed<br />
Head enchants are gone. <br />
<br />
We decided that putting head enchants on the various faction vendors wasn't working well with our design intent for the factions. There is a lot of max-level quest content in MoP, much of it focused around the reputation with the new factions. I think it's really cool stuff -- worlds away from the old Argent Dawn scourge stone days.<br />
<br />
In previous expansions, the head enchants on the faction vendors served to force players into that content. You couldn't even choose which reputation to pursue -- you had to pursue the one with your specific head enchant. Our design intent for MoP is to give players options in how to play, and the head enchant design wasn't compatible with that. <br />
<br />
Once we decided to no longer offer new head enchants, we made the older ones non-functional or else players would feel like they had to go back to older content or be missing out on power. This way, helmets are just no longer enchantable and you'll have one less required step to get a piece of loot ready to wear.<br />
<br />
Shoulder enchants can now be provided by scribes, so those still exist, but they are also not part of the faction reputation system. <br />
<br />

Session Spoofing<br />
We've investigated several reports of &quot;session spoofing,&quot; as reported both in these forums and elsewhere on the internet. We treat these kinds of reports very seriously; however, to date, we have yet to identify a single case of compromise which was the result of a player joining or participating in a public game. <br />
<br />
Additionally, we've looked into the issue and found no evidence to indicate compromises are occurring in this fashion, and we've determined the methods being suggested to do so are technically impossible. <br />
<br />
Even so, we're continuing to investigate related reports. If you have evidence which supports your claim that such reports are &quot;100% true,&quot; then please relay that information to our support representatives. If you're just spreading hearsay, however...well, that's just not cool. Spinning the rumor mill isn't helping the community, it's only making it dizzy.

Auction House Error 31073<br />
Players will sometimes receive &quot;Error 31073&quot; when attempting to create a new auction. This is an intentional measure to help improve auction house stability by throttling the number of auctions that can be created at any given time. To that end we plan on updating the messaging that accompanies this error in a future patch to better describe why players are receiving it. If you receive this error message when attempting to list an auction you should wait a few moments and try again. While we understand this is an inconvenience, our goal is to ensure a more stable auction house experience for everyone.

While I understand his reasoning, I do think it would be appropriate to split it into a Diablo news update and a WoW update. And some option to hide the Diablo ones would be nice. While I'm playing and like the game a lot, I really think this a WoW site. Diablofans exists if I want MMOchamp-style data on the D3.</div></div><hr />

It's not about simple - it's about boring. No one got anything out of grinding one particular faction on a toon after the first patch. It was a boring prerequisite. It added nothing to the depth of play, it just stretched the whole thing out.<br />
<br />
My most recent toon I had ready for Raid Finder in a day. Yet I still had to spend two weeks doing dungeons just to get the helm enchant. It was boring. It didn't help anything. And it didn't make my toon more powerful, it just got it up to speed with everyone else. <br />
<br />

<br />
ha, that's not even the worst of it. I am pretty confident after thorough testing the throttle is by ilvl. I believe the higher the ilvl the lower in queue (and higher chance of failure) you have. I can almost certainly without a doubt sell a crappy item with no problem, second i start trying to unload inferno stuff, failure 100% of time without fail. It definitely seems to be tied to items, if it's not ilvl then it's some other type of item based priority filter server is doing as a throttle.<br />
<br />
What gets me is, to improve the quality of service, they are denying service. Personally i think it was betty when it was lagging and timed out from time to time. VS not laggy but not able to sell about 90% of your items. sigh.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that the helm enchants are boa and once you are exhalted with said factions you can just send alts the enchants from that toon right? Also it boggles why they havent made the shoulder enchants boa yet. It didnt take them this long to do it in wotlk.</div></div><hr />

I'm not bashing taking out head enchants, but we have to remember what makes WoW the MMO it is. Take out all of the grindfests and what are you really left with? That's when people will start complaining about being bored, because they have nothing that takes time to accomplish anymore.</div></div><hr />

Because then it is just an annoyance logging onto another alt and mail them.<br />

Not really, as Head enchants we're BOA, not BOP, so you could grind the faction on your main, to have all factions exalted, then buy it with him and post it to your alts.....which begs the question of why anyone would feel a need to grind rep with more than one character, if you do it, it's your choice...<br />

<br />
from what i've read, shoulder enchants are no longer a faction reward, they are now done by scribes; these could be given to scribes or enchanters too, but blizz seem to think it just complicates matters</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wownomo</div><div class="date">2012-05-31, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the reasoning and logic behind the whole specific faction having your chant and forcing you into gameplay instead of allowing you to play where you want, but removing them completely I think is just a lazy solution. Tabards helped reach this rep goal, but were really just a burden to carry around, swap on and off, etc... Making them BoA back when they did was basically Blizzard admitting that this was a pain in the ass form of gameplay and they were going to help you by not having to repeat it on your alts (except shoulders for w/e reason).<br />
<br />
So developer and players both agree the previous rep enchant grind was a pain, not engaging game play. So the answer is to just remove them entirely? LAZY! Get a little more creative and figure out a way to keep them around without having to mindless grind quests and dailys. I'd rather see them remain in the VP vendors inventory and cost gold/points/whatever than see them completely removed. Give them to a vendor who's unlocked halfway thru whatever our first raid is going to be. Give them scribes along with the shoulder chants. Something, anything to keep the chants in game.<br />
<br />
I know I'm going to be feeling a little naked in the helm department when I don't see those extra stats up there come MoP.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekobaka</div><div class="date">2012-05-31, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For myself the helm enchants was never really a problem as far as a grind was concerned. You could usually unlock the tabard quickly while leveling anyways and then do dungeons. The shoulder enchants on the other hand was easily skip able while leveling and to this day I do not have the Cata shoulder enchants because Blizzard stuck the quest chain so far into a zone that you did not need to spend much time in and I lost track of the quest, a horrible design IMO.<br />
<br />
The whole purpose of these enchants and rep vendors was to get players to see the content along with the other repuation vendor rewards, if you want to gear out you will be doing content that you may or may not want to do. With a tabard vendor and BoA enchants, there is not as much of an issue as there was with say the shoulder enchants. To say they dont serve their purpose is basically saying that obtaining them is so easy that they might as well just remove them. Blizzard might as well remove all stat based reputation rewards so that players dont feel forced to grind a reputation.</div></div><hr />

There's any number of other ways the head enchant could have been made available without tying players into a specific rep grind. You could have a 'helm enchant' vendor unlocked at exalted with every rep, they could have added them to an existing profession, they could have been a JP or VP purchase, they could even wait and introduce them in a 5.1 rep-grind (think molten front). Hell, they could even go the vanilla route and make them obtained through raid content like the old ZG enchants. I don't think it will make a big difference at the end of the day, but it shows a lack of creativity. I like working for things and this is just one less thing to for me to work towards in MoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I say this with all due respect, but I think you're in a minority. I think most people &quot;work towards&quot; things in real life at work or school or uni so much that when they sit down at their computer to play a game, they just want to run into a dungeon and kill stuff with their friends (or strangers!) for a while - not do daily quests over and over, or worry about this rep or that being most important or whatever. I think that's just the way it is. Blizzard wisely need to cater to the majority of players - if they don't, they lose subs, and lose money, which isn't great for the game as a whole. Lose 1% of hardcores, or 99% of casuals - it's just math.<br />
<br />
Obviously those stats are a WAG. Not even a guess, just a representation...</div></div><hr />

Yet I still had to spend time doing raids/dungeons just to get attuned. It was boring...&quot; See where I'm going with this? <br />
<br />
I'm not bashing taking out head enchants, but we have to remember what makes WoW the MMO it is. Take out all of the grindfests and what are you really left with? That's when people will start complaining about being bored, because they have nothing that takes time to accomplish anymore.<br />
<br />
Take a look at it this way.<br />
<br />
Now that reputations aren't mandatory to grind for raid preparation, perhaps they can remove the rep tabards and make rep grinds a bit of a challenge to do again, for those who like mount or tabard collecting, a la Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
There's no need to view changes as all minuses, but as the potential to lead to entertaining pluses down the road.<br />
<br />
But the reality of it is, most people I've spoken to about the change are in huge favor for it, especially those people who detested Deepholm questing. Why? Because they don't want to have to do an obnoxious quest chain just for the ability to buy a tabard to rep grind in dungeons (which is what they want to do). Nor did they ever want to have to do 8 dailies each day in some out-of-the-way location somewhere just to get some sort of raiding requirement handled. Quite a few people don't like doing daily quests, and they shouldn't have to feel obligated to do them just to prepare for other completely separate elements of gameplay that holds the most draw for them as players.<br />
<br />
And yes, as it stands, Questing is &quot;solo PvE&quot; and dungeons/raids are &quot;group PvE&quot;. That's Blizzard's catigorization there, as you've noticed that most group quests have been eliminated from the game... hence this is their design philosophy. It is such as that because there are persons who can and will prefer one element over the other, and the ability for Blizzard to allow people to enjoy one solo element without feeling obligated to the other is why WoW thrives to this day. It's the reasoning for PvP stats/gear back in TBC, and it's the reasoning for this change, too.<br />
<br />
You don't have to like their reasoning, but it makes sense. But it's certainly not a 'cop out' or 'bowing to laziness'. Just because people play WoW in a different way than you do does not invalidate their worth of having some sort of design decisions made that facilitates them and ultimately makes the game less of a damn chore for all players.<br />
<br />
edit: and to the poster immediately below me, you realize how much of an insane minority you're in, right? Do you remember the statistics of people who even cleared Sunwell before its nerf? Or how many cleared it after the nerf?<br />
<br />
Catering to what amounts to 1-2% of your player population to experience content that takes the vast majority of development time is stupid game design no matter how you cut it. You can go ask game companies that are ATTEMPTING to cater to your tastes though. Like let's ask Trion, for instance. Ask how Rift's &quot;We have 1 million game accounts!&quot; a year ago is doing now, now that 4 of their servers literally ghost-towned after the launch of Diablo 3.... and that was AFTER they announced they had only about 200,000 players left back in April.</div></div><hr />

WoW was a a grindfest back in Vanilla and in TBC (in the beginning) and I found it fun, but yet people find the helm enchant pointless and stupid because you have to grind a faction? You mean like Oracles who could reward a mount? So it wasn't a flashy mount.. It was a helm enchant but guess what you learned a lil more that day by doing the quests and unlocking more by doing them. Plus you earned a lil more gold each day. Kept you from becoming those bums who ask for gold in Capital Cities... At some point enchants themselves will just be stupid, nothing a gem cant do.... The only enchants left will be ones that make your weapon shiny and thats because the the base of this game is children.. Yes Pandaria has lore from way back when but honestly... This looks more like Nick Jr's World of Warcraft... and if you don't know what Nick Jr is, its a children's progrem on Nickelodeon. I've played the game for 7 years and honestly I think its just getting too easy. With each expansion content was getting cleared faster and faster.. The only dungeon to swift kick raiders in the nuts was Sunwell Pre-nerf... I don't know about you, but I like a challenge.. I don't want to feel like I wasted my money to get handed everything.. All in all, having faction rep and certain items or enchants earned was a displaly of dedication and the fact you don't want to look like a chump or for that matter like everyone else.... Thats all its becoming is equal opportunity without the whole dedicated part. Fair maybe, but the only objective for the hardcore base now is &quot;how fast can we clear this&quot;. There is no standing out because everyone has either the same gear different color. Nothing really impressive anymore. Mounts are great but I enjoy the whole package when it comes down to it. I know some will see my point and others will disagree which I expect but dont last out at me if you feel offended.. Because if you're offended you need to get out more.<br />

My most recent toon I had ready for Raid Finder in a day. Yet I still had to spend two weeks doing dungeons just to get the helm enchant. It was boring. It didn't help anything. And it didn't make my toon more powerful, it just got it up to speed with everyone else. <br />

2 weeks for grinding revered ? <br />
I have to say that you are doing something very wrong in your playstile. I made my rogue from 78 to 85 in the last weekend. When I dinged 84, went to Uldum, made friendly in about 2 hours, bought and equiped the tabard. Made quests in Uldum area untill the conquest of Neferset? city and maybe fouror five dungeons in the same time. After i dinged 85, in about 5 - 6 more dungeons i had revered with the faction, so i could buy the head enchant. That means in another 6 hours of gameplay. So, no way &quot;2 weeks of grinding&quot;. Or yeah, in case you are doing for the next 2 weeks a half of a dungeon each day it could be possible.</div></div><hr />

Taking the helmets and giving to another crafter would unbalance the crafts...kinda (that's if you personally believe they are indeed balanced) like BS has socket bonus- alchs have potion benefits and self healing etc etc etc. Then again could be looking at it wrong but eh oh well lol just my thought on why its not added to a profession like they're going to with shoulders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I kind of disagree about the reason being explained... It was a big grind and dictated your choice of reputation, yes, but all that says to me is that they needed to change the way you obtain helm enchantments. It doesn't really explain the reasoning behind removing them completely. They could have simply removed the reputation requirement and find another source for them. Transfer them to Inscription, maybe even Enchanting or make them available for a small amount of justice/valor points, for instance. It just seems rather extreme that when faced with the problem of helm enchantments being too &quot;grindy&quot;, the solution they came up with was &quot;let's just wipe them out completely&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well here's the thing then... what if people want those new rewards without the grind and justify it the same way head enchants are justified now? What then? This kind of mentalitiy is exactly what for some people keeps WoW getting more and more shallow with each passing day. Once agian it contradicts with game buisness model which should encourage you to play more. What is the point of keeping a long subscription if you're keep getting spoon fed like that?</div></div><hr />

Well, it's nearly the same talent-philosophy from Diablo 3: You get a hand full of useful tools for most of the situations. Use them wisely.<br />
<br />
It's a little bit harder to balance for a class that can handle three different roles (tank/heal/dd), but at the end of the day, the player will have to use his brain more often.<br />
<br />
Skill trees are wonderful for a single player game, where there is no need for a perfect balancing. They are static and therefore hard to adjust, because there are so many multipliers included.<br />
<br />
In the future you will be able to select your special abilities strategically before a fight to receive the best outcome. At best, your choices will directly influence your performance. Maybe next ID you are interested in doing it differently to be better or to outweight some unfitting skill choices.<br />
<br />
This is one of the (few) coolest things in Diablo 3. I like to switch and check my set of abilities for a certain boss fight. For me it's one of the best possible solutions for the skill-tree-problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take the rep grind funneling out of the equation and what does that buyable enchant really add to the game? Right nothing. There is no choice involved because there is only one for each role. All it does is take 100+ Gold away and let you do 2 right clicks and a left click. Done.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now what I would like to see is shoulder AND head enchant go to enchanter (seriously what does a scribe have to do with gear enchants in the first place if there is a profession solely themed around gear enchanting? This is just Blizzard being desperate because their glyph system makes scribes absolutely useless nowadays.) and add more head enchants so there is choice involved (want haste? want crit? want mastery? maybe create other fun effects similar to movement speed for boots.)<br />
<br />
But nah too much work, just remove it. Sad. :(</div></div><hr />

You totally just described WoW's entire enchant system. See, it could be interesting and could add a lot to the gameplay. Yet because of how WoW implements the enchants they end up simply being extra numbers added onto your equipment that you have to get before raiding, which adds absolutely no gameplay or choice whatsoever.<br />

Hooray, enchants!</div></div><hr />

There are so many other more important problems to address! This wasn't worth 1 sec of development time. And if they felt like it needed changing, why not make head enchants available from whichever faction you decide to farm first?!<br />
I hate when Blizz takes stuff out, it's just one less thing to do, no matter how small, in a game where everyone is bored to hell and complains that they burn through content too fast.<br />

Yet I still had to spend time doing raids/dungeons just to get attuned. It was boring...&quot; See where I'm going with this? <br />
<br />
I'm not bashing taking out head enchants, but we have to remember what makes WoW the MMO it is. Take out all of the grindfests and what are you really left with? That's when people will start complaining about being bored, because they have nothing that takes time to accomplish anymore.<br />
<br />
We are getting much more interresting &quot;grind-fests&quot; than rep just for an enchant (and I am completely aware that the helm enchants are currently BoA. Personally, I never had any issue getting enough rep on individual alts simply because I enjoy questing so I do it on multiple toons...for the helm enchants questing generally would get you to the necessary rep even without additional &quot;grinding&quot; from instances via tabard.<br />
<br />
My issue with the helm enchants (and shoulder for that matter) is that they force you to grind rep for a particular faction. Maybe I really love Rahmaken but hate Avenger's of Hyjal...too bad for me as a caster. I am forced to spend time in an area I dislike because I have to grind enough rep for an enchant. Shoulder enchants were always held by the most horrible area in game or the one that meant the most flying around for one quest from one side of the world to the other...just completely boring game-play.<br />
<br />
The &quot;grind-fest&quot; will always be there, as it should be. But we shouldn't be forced to grind something we don't want and have to wait to grind what we do want. I'm glad they are getting rid of Helm enchants and making Shoulder enchants Inscription items. I will now be able to &quot;grind&quot; what I want to grind and not what I'm forced to grind.<br />
<br />
Boring doesn't add depth to play. And giving us choices on what to &quot;grind&quot; doesn't take away from the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Scribes should focus on boosting stuff not creating new stuff - the profession is past it's target. <br />
They should be able to boost enchants/gems/armor kits/what not, but not create anything. <br />
Let's say a you as a jeweler create a Brilliant Queen's Garnet gem, a scribe should boost that gem to +60 (low) and +75int (high). you craft Enchant Bracer - Agility, a scribe should boost it to +60 and +75 agility. That's what a scribe should do, not create new stuff, especially not enchants since he has nothing to do with it. <br />
<br />
Goes for all professions tbh, for example tailors shouldn't do leg enchants and cloak enchants. <br />
<br />
But as it is now is just filler, 'cause crafted stuff from most professions is just crap (2 minutes later from when you get a recipe), so each profession needs something to be worth taking, so we get this filler shit that gives professions some use, which is flawed.</div></div><hr />

I don't know anyone enjoys grinding for head enchants fun. I would love a Drake of the West wind and various other items that rep gives, but since I don't enjoy that aspect of the game I don't do it; it's not worth it<br />
<br />
I'm just starting DS heroic, and I don't have rep enchants. As a healer, I feel obligated to get every single stat point that I can, because the difference with each new item is pretty noticeable. Almost everything that I need can be acquired from doing raids, including the money I need to upgrade gems from +40 int to +50. This works for me, since I enjoy raids. <br />
<br />
The enchant requires that I either except a stat loss (which isn't acceptable to min/maxers) or get involved in a lengthy rep grind. This makes many players feel &quot;forced&quot; to play a side of wow that they don't like, in order to acquire an item that isn't even fun. Some raid members will actually point out stat losses from not having particular enchants, and tell players to get them. Yes we can refuse, but with so many players relying on us (healers and tanks in particular), it's hard to justify.<br />
<br />
I feel that necessary raid items should be available via raids, dungeon items via dungeons, pvp via pvp etc. That way players can stick with what they prefer to do. Removing this head enchant is a small but meaningful step towards making this happen.<br />
<br />
I really don't see what the big deal is, it's a very minor change, and there are plenty of grinds to be found in WoW</div></div><hr />

Yeah, the arcanums purchased prior to the fix still require rep. It seems that instead of fixing them they simply replaced with new versions sold by vendors, as the fixed arcanums had different item I.D. numbers than the ones purchased early in the expansion.</div></div><hr />

We decided that putting head enchants on the various faction vendors wasn't working well with our design intent for the factions. There is a lot of max-level quest content in MoP, much of it focused around the reputation with the new factions. I think it's really cool stuff -- worlds away from the old Argent Dawn scourge stone days.<br />

I'd imagine that would get a response from Blizzard akin to: &quot;That's still forcing players to do content.&quot; I suppose for whatever small subsection of players only quest enough to level, and spend most of their time in Dungeons, Raids, and BGs.</div></div><hr />

That's not the point. When the helms went BoA in WotLK, there was no rep requirement on the part of the alt to use them. However, in Cataclysm this was changed to include requiring the appropriate rep to use it/them on an alt. It was a ridiculous move on their part, and I don't understand how they can't just go back to how it was in WotLK. Or failing that, why can head enchants not be moved to a profession as their shoulder counterparts were?</div></div><hr />

So keeping shoulders in the game and giving the ability to sell a 'lesser' version then one for scribes only makes sense. Taking the helmets and giving to another crafter would unbalance the crafts...kinda (that's if you personally believe they are indeed balanced) like BS has socket bonus- alchs have potion benefits and self healing etc etc etc. Then again could be looking at it wrong but eh oh well lol just my thought on why its not added to a profession like they're going to with shoulders.<br />
<br />
Or you know could give it to engineers and then have it be balanced....<br />

How about simply giving the head enchant(s) to the profession it should have been since day number one? Enchanting... You could always make them buyable or better yet, droppable patterns from 5man dungeons.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is just really boring about everything these days. Just remove the gemslots too while you're at it, doh. These days they like to remove and edit, instead of just add new things on every game they make.<br />
<br />
enchanting doesn't need another enchanting slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
casual gamer should't be the same with raiders etc... you could put head enchant as part of a quest taking you into different areas instead of removing it ...<br />
MOP is starting to annoy me big time...first the changes in talent trees that dont leave alot of choices to people ...they should put effort in creating more options making people research their class instead of limiting their choices...since it will then go down to people with faster connection better pcs that will be better of pressing buttons faster instead of actually making people think what to choose and when... another -1 for blizzard.</div></div><hr />

No one got anything out of grinding one particular faction on a toon after the first patch. It was a boring prerequisite. It added nothing to the depth of play, it just stretched the whole thing out.<br />
<br />
My most recent toon I had ready for Raid Finder in a day. Yet I still had to spend two weeks doing dungeons just to get the helm enchant. It was boring. It didn't help anything. And it didn't make my toon more powerful, it just got it up to speed with everyone else. <br />
<br />
That isn't fun. And if it isn't fun, why should it be kept?<br />
<br />
There's such a simple reply to this. If its boring, dont remove it, make it fun. It's boring so remove it? Leveling up Skinning is boring so let's remove it. It's a lazy mans solution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm. I kinda do and kinda don't.<br />
<br />
I begrudge having to pay someone to &quot;make&quot; an enchant (or having to level up a profession just for one enchant) and I really would prefer to have them available from rep vendors rather than needing a profession.<br />
<br />
I don't get why Blizzard would remove rep grinds when they're trying to get people back out in to the world (eg. flying not available until max level).<br />
<br />
Yet another pointless removal of something in game, but then after almost 6 years of playing I guess I should have expected nothing less.<br />
<br />
**edit. Also, the Shoulder and Helm enchants aren't needed by everyone, only serious players who wish to raid at their optimum. If they're raiding seriously then a rep grind should be no problem at all! Failing that, they clearly don't take raiding seriously enough.</div></div><hr />
