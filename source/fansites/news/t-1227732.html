Boss Pull Counts<br />
WoWProgress added a nice new feature (http://www.wowprogress.com/post/127_Amount_of_Pulls_on_WoWProgress!), boss pull counts! It shows how many times players attempted a boss. <br />

<br />
Arena Exploitation and Win Trading<br />
Providing an environment where players can compete in the spirit of fair play is extremely important to us, particularly in rated Player versus Player combat. As part of that commitment we regularly monitor gameplay, and have discovered an issue where some Arena teams have exploited the queuing system to obtain high team ratings, “dodge” unfavorable team compositions, and engage in win trading. <br />
<br />
These, and all, exploitative activities are absolutely prohibited. We will investigate the situation carefully, and players that have been found to have participated in exploitation will be subject to the appropriate actions against their World of Warcraft accounts and characters, including:<br />
<br />
<br />
Arena team deletion<br />
Character MMR reset to 1500<br />
All Conquest gear removed<br />
Conquest earned tally reset, as well as all Honor and Conquest points removed.<br />
All Arena achievements earned since the beginning of Mists of Pandaria removed.<br />
3 day suspension<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to the measures already discussed, as a result of the rating inflation that occurred due to the exploitative activity, all Team Ratings and MMR above 2200 will be reset to 2200 during the upcoming maintenance.<br />
<br />
Please note: Conquest Point caps should not be affected by this reset. Point Caps will return to the appropriate levels relative to rating the following week.<br />
<br />
Does that include RBG ratings? A quick answer would be appreciated as queuing hangs in the balance!<br />
It doesn't include Rated Battlegrounds at this time, and this is primarily aimed at the recognized Arena issue. <br />
<br />
We're looking into RBGs though.<br />
<br />
I think this change is geared towards people who weren't intentionally exploiting, but gained rating off of exploiters.<br />
Correct!<br />
<br />

Arena Ranking Improvements<br />
You know, when they said more active teams would benefit from playing more often and how they said they would energize ladder teams etc etc<br />
The new system should be arriving in patch 5.1. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/245491-when-are-the-team-rating-changes-going-live/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7178928717?page=1#3))<br />

Hide Shoulders Option<br />
Blizzard has stated in no uncertain terms that hiding shoulders isn't something they'd consider.<br />
That's not entirely accurate. It's true that offering an option to hide shoulders is something we've been reluctant to do, because so much effort goes into the creation of shoulder art, and those items are some of the most visually distinctive and iconic items in World of Warcraft. It's not necessarily totally off of the table though. As we've said often in the past, we still plan to grow and evolve the Transmogrification feature over time.<br />
<br />
Well, to be fair Blizz open the door to this when they allowed us to hide our helmets...that makes less sense than hiding shoulders<br />
One could make that argument, but opting to show a character's face is a choice we've offered for quite a long time. It's sort of its own thing; especially considering that there is quite a lot of art and animation specifically for character heads and faces, and customization of those features is a significant part of making your character your own. Allowing faces to be displayed makes sense in that context. While armor doesn't necessarily look terrible without shoulders, I don't think that making exposed shoulders interesting has been high on the priorities when designing chest armor textures/models over time.<br />
<br />
how about having the artist team making a complete set that looks good for a change?<br />
Art is an extremely subjective thing. With very rare exceptions, if you take any random piece of armor or art, and ask people for opinions, they'll almost certainly be divided.<br />
<br />
For example, I uh, never really liked any of the AQ40 stuff (scandalous!). I know people that love it so much they have it 'mogged to this day. *shrug* (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/245473-hide-shoulders-option/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7179258666?page=3#47))<br />
<br />
Listening to Feedback<br />
I've seen the following statement I made quoted a few times:<br />
<br />
Your guess is spot on. We are constantly gathering and analyzing information on gameplay. Raw data is tremendously useful, but it doesn't really offer context, which is why other sources of information are essential.<br />
The responses it has received suggest that the responders didn't read the most important part of that statement, though:<br />
<br />
Raw data is tremendously useful, but it doesn't really offer context, which is why other sources of information are essential.<br />
We know that raw data doesn't give us the whole story regarding why players are doing one thing or another in-game - we're always trying to fill in the context behind why players make the choices that they do. It's not enough to know that an activity or feature is popular, it's important to try to understand why.<br />
<br />
Any ETA on CRZ fixes? Not troling/whatever but i am interested when all the bugs are going to be worked out. Good Luck all!<br />
No specific ETAs, but there are some changes coming in 5.1 that may help address some of the issues with the timing of holiday events, confusion over realm time zone changes, and the like.

8th Anniversary Letter<br />
but still nothing about the awkward mail we received.<br />
That was indeed a bug, and it does not appear that it can be hotfixed. <br />
<br />
Suffice it to say that we're not happy about that, but we are happy that you guys have all joined us for the 8th Anniversary of World of Warcraft. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/245426-8th-anniversary-seriously/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7178648344?page=21#407))<br />

1v1 Arenas<br />
While in theory this sounds fun, the game just isn’t balanced around 1v1, not even 2v2, 3v3 is probably the most balanced bracket. <br />
With 1v1, you could have fights that could last indefinitely, specs that wouldn’t work, everyone would probably have to switch to damage dealing specs or tanking specs (imagine double healers facing each other).<br />
<br />
As you probably know 2v2 already has some restrictions when it comes to the rewards you can get from it exactly for the very same reason, so I wouldn’t expect 1v1 anytime soon.<br />
<br />
But thanks for the suggestion, I do understand where this comes from, it's fun to duel, it really is, but that's why we have the duel option, but we must recognize that duelling has no place in Arenas as the game works right now, this doesn't mean that it will never happen, just that we don't currently have any plans for it, if one day we do, I’m sure that will only happen if circumstances change drastically and somehow we manage to balance PvP across all brackets with a radical new approach to it.<br />
<br />
I know this is especially bothersome to those of you who really enjoy playing alone and prefer the 1on1 competitiveness of PvP, just like some people prefer to only do 1vs1 in RTS games, I know that some players are so competitive that when you win, you want to know that it was 100% because of you and only you and not because of your teammate, it’s nice to have total control over the fight, I get that, but still we can't put 1v1 in arenas unless we feel it’s equivalent to all the other brackets, and as I said, at the moment we don’t even feel 2v2 is equivalent to 3v3 or 5v5.

World of Warcraft’s 8th Anniversary Video<br />
World of Warcraft turns eight on November 23, 2012! Another epic year has flown by, and we’d like to thank you all for joining us on so many great adventures. To celebrate, players who log into the game between the dates of November, 18 through December, 1 will receive a feat of strength added to their Achievements and a “Celebration Package” item. Using your item will kick off the celebrations by shooting off fireworks*, applying a (visual only) tabard to your character, and granting an 8% bonus to experience and reputation gains from any enemies defeated while active.<br />
<br />
For an extra bonus this year we’ve put together a little video to take you through the years from the original release of World of Warcraft to the newly revealed shores of the Mists of Pandaria. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the journey. We know we have.<br />
<br />
We look forward to another year of adventures ahead and many more to come!<br />
<br />
*Use fireworks responsibly. Harmful or fatal if swallowed. If fireworks get in eyes, rinse in muddy pond water for 20 minutes, /dance, and contact your nearest Mistweaver, Priest, Shaman, Druid, or Paladin.<br />

<br />
Couple of things. A lot of that content is still run today, either by twink guilds for gear or small groups farming them for transmog/pets/mounts/achieves, and I think that's enough for most people. Even if stuff like MC was scaled up to 90 (god forbid, I never want to see the inside of that place again) the mechanics are dated and dull. It would create a huge heap of stuff for Blizz to balance classes around, and I don't see it being anything other than a mess.<br />
<br />
Secondly, not to bash GW2 or anything, but Anet apparently doesn't understand what their statement means. Yes there's downscaling to give you a tiny semblance of difficulty (you still 1-2 shot stuff even downscaled so it doesn't really matter), but as an 80 there's zero reason (outside of map completion) to go to lower level zones. Want to know where the max level population is right now? Lost Shores/Fractals. Because that's what the &quot;worthwhile&quot; content is.<br />
<br />
tl;dr: WoW is fine as is, go play (or stay with, if you are playing already) GW if you like what they did with their game so much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For years, Blizzard has ignored an obvious flaw in WoW - healers do too little damage. Why are tanks, who are a defensive spec just like healers, viable in arena but healers not? Because tanks do respectable damage, enough to potentially kill dps specs and even each other. Healers, in contrast, cannot kill anyone who is equally geared and at the keyboard, because their damage output is lower than can easily be handled by the various defenses of even dps classes, let alone tanks or other healers. Healers also have minimal burst capability, making it almost impossible to finish someone off even if the healer does manage to get them low.<br />
<br />
Why SHOULDN'T healers do more damage, more like 75% of a DPS spec rather than 40%? Would it mess up raiding? Nope. Blizzard could easily tune around this and even create more bosses where the healers were expected to dps in some phases. As it is now, they do so little damage that is rarely worth the bother. Soloing? Heck no, healers need more damage here than anywhere else. Few people solo/quest as healers precisely because of their poor damage output. So that only leaves PvP, where more damage would solve the problem of healers being unable to kill anyone without help (which is insanely NOT fun from the healer's point of view!!!) and create overall better balance in small-scale situations. The only downside is the larger brackets might need to be re-balanced if healers become OP, but this isn't all that hard to do.<br />
<br />
Up healer damage now, thank you very much.</div></div><hr />

Any &quot;pure dps&quot; will be replaced by healer as only healer spec would be capable to withstand the other healer. <br />
<br />
In both way. To heal themself and even to kill the opposing healer. Pure dpser would have no chance whatsoever 'cause if he cannot kill the healer &quot;soon&quot;, he will just die &quot;later&quot;. So fat chance that Blizz devs will throw balance away in such a way. <br />
<br />
On the other hand it would be nice if <br />
<br />
Resto Shaman, Resto Druid , Disc Priest would be a viable setup up in Arena <br />
<br />
Or just imagine to throw in the above setup also Holy Paladin and Mistweaver Monk and you would have a killer 5v5 combo.<br />
<br />
Well you can still dream about that. :)</div></div><hr />

Banning won't happen. Blizzard does not resort to mass closure of accounts for exploitation, although they do for use of 3rd party hacks and bots. This action amounts to a slap on the wrist, which is the punishment they hand out for lots of different infractions anymore. Years ago you would get banned if you so much as pulled a boss in a way they didn't like or used the F word in trade. The game has evolved since though, you won't see any closures due to exploiting an unfair advantage anymore and trolling/harassing is a new E-sport in the game. <br />
<br />
Realistically a rollback to 2200 for everyone isn't that bad, the people that are really that good will gain their MMR and gear back in no time. Everyone else will threaten ragequit but probably won't.</div></div><hr />

I think that's more attempts on 1 boss than actualy raid kills I ever did myself, in 8 years! And they do these hundreds of attempts in a the same night!<br />

I now realise why guilds were against the 20 attempts per boss gating in Wrath.</div></div><hr />

A hundred attempts on a boss is nothing. That's considered a easy boss. Ragnaros HC in Firelands took the first guild more than 500.</div></div><hr />

A lot of that content is still run today, either by twink guilds for gear or small groups farming them for transmog/pets/mounts/achieves, and I think that's enough for most people. Even if stuff like MC was scaled up to 90 (god forbid, I never want to see the inside of that place again) the mechanics are dated and dull. It would create a huge heap of stuff for Blizz to balance classes around, and I don't see it being anything other than a mess.<br />
<br />
Secondly, not to bash GW2 or anything, but Anet apparently doesn't understand what their statement means. Yes there's downscaling to give you a tiny semblance of difficulty (you still 1-2 shot stuff even downscaled so it doesn't really matter), but as an 80 there's zero reason (outside of map completion) to go to lower level zones. Want to know where the max level population is right now? Lost Shores/Fractals. Because that's what the &quot;worthwhile&quot; content is.<br />
<br />
tl;dr: WoW is fine as is, go play (or stay with, if you are playing already) GW if you like what they did with their game so much.<br />
<br />
I can think of many reasons to go back to other zones in GW2, in WoW there is 2 reasons, loremaster/map achievement, wuptido.<br />
<br />
I have yet to see any one, ever on the servers i'm on that does the old content as twinks/whatever, it's level 90 or thereabout that just do it for achievements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
75% is not a magic number. Maybe it is 60%. But it is certainly far above what it currently is, where healers are incapable of killing anyone on their own and are essentially not even a rounding error if real dps are present. Note that tanks do much higher damage than healers, despite both being defensive in nature, yet tanking specs have a rather spotty history in PvP and only have occasionally been viable. The fact that multi-healer groups WOULD be viable is not necessary a bad thing, as long as they were not OP. Blizzard has plenty of knobs to turn in order to keep such things under control.</div></div><hr />
