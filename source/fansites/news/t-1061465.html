<br />
The mage nerfs are obviously correcting the over-buff they got in 4.3, 17% increase i believe it was.<br />
<br />
Someone said something about wands being an instant, but much like multishot before Cata, it is instant, but it has a short cast time so you can't use it while moving.<br />
<br />
The black arrow buff was just to give it priority over explosive trap for single target fights, and it didn't increase the dmg, just gives it more chances to proc LnL.</div></div><hr />

Wants, and throw/gun/bow attacks (except for hunters) had a 0.5 delay. Not a cast time, but you had to stand still that amount of time before a missile was fired. It was really stupid, not worth whining about on the forums, but should have been fixed loooong ago (especially for warrior tanks prior to heroic throw)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Maybe I misunderstood, you probably were just pointing out that the change is old news.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep it does less! But for a good reason...<br />
<br />
It does less dmg because it's split between only half of the raid...since you have to deal with Morchok AND his twin - so it's actually MORE dmg split between fewer players.</div></div><hr />

The Black Arrow change is a very very slight buff if you were playing correctly and using Explosive Trap. This just makes sure we actually use Black Arrow.</div></div><hr />

Its a tooltip fix that mechanic has been the same since it released it was just worded different.<br />

•Deterrence now also reduces all damage taken by 30% while active.When activated, increases the chance melee attacks will miss you by 100%, reduces the chance ranged attacks will hit you by 100% and grants a 100% chance to deflect spells.

<br />
<br />
BA change is awesome. Throwing traps sucks. I notice the lack of Lock and Load not using Arcane Shot disappeared from the patch notes. Wonder where that went.<br />
<br />
700 RAP (~900-1100 RAP depending on spec) sounds nice but is kinda meh when a sort of decently geared hunter can already have 15k+. Skills use a % of RAP so this isn't a raw damage increase. Plus, since it is on Hawk we get even MORE penalized for switching to Fox.<br />
<br />
Deterrence is still very limited because of the fact you still can't attack with it on. It can now be used to reduce one big ae blast by 30% as long as you have a cancelaura macro (gg more keybinds!) ready to go so you don't stand around for 5 seconds doing nothing but sucking a little less healer mana. If used to reduce a DOT..lol.. You affect get 2 ticks normally.</div></div><hr />

There are certain boss abilities which get past deterrence. My guess is this change is made to give hunters a cd against those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Zon'Ozz Heroic Retuned/Normal nerfed?:(Buff to aoe but nerf to eyes individual damage. Seems could be they want to rebalance the fight a little less RNG bursty, so less risk of someone getting WTF owned by being targeted by a bunch of stuff at once. The overall raid damage should be about the same i speculate)<br />
Black Blood of Go'rath: Deals 4300 (up from 3795) damage every 2 seconds (per stack)<br />
The Eye of Go'rath casts its Shadowy Gaze at a random player, inflicting 23310 to 27090 (down from 25900 to 30100) Shadow damage.<br />
<br />
Hagara Nerfed?:<br />
Drowning within Hagara's water bubble causes 12% (down from 15%) of maximum health to be lost and reduces movement speed by 50%.<br />
<br />
Ultraxion?: (green buff removing &quot;direct&quot; from tooltip is what caught my eye, does this mean what i think? green will now affect more hots?<br />
Essence of Dreams: Imbues one target with the power of dreams. Healing done is duplicated and distributed evenly amongst all friendly targets within 50 yards.<br />
<br />
Gunship Nerfs?:<br />
Twilight Barrage (10N/25N): Deals 140000 (down from 200000) Shadow damage to players within 5 yards of the point of impact. If no players are struck, the Skyfire instead suffers the full brunt.<br />
Twilight Barrage (10H): Deals 280000 (down from 300000) Shadow damage to players within 5 yards of the point of impact and increases their Shadow damage taken by 50% for 15 sec, stacking. If no players are struck, the Skyfire instead suffers the full brunt.<br />
Twilight Barrage (25H): Deals 280000 (down from 300000) Shadow damage to players within 5 yards of the point of impact and increases their Shadow damage taken by 50% for 6 sec, stacking. If no players are struck, the Skyfire instead suffers the full brunt.<br />
<br />
Spine Nerfed?:<br />
Blood of Neltharion (10H/25H): The barest hint of a shadow of the former Earth-Warder suffuses your blood. Damage taken from all sources is reduced by 20% (up from 10%). This effect can stack up to $U times<br />
Degradation (10H/25H): Destroyed Amalgamations degrade the maximum health of all enemy targets by 5% (down from 6%). This effect occurs regardless of the state of the nucleus and stacks up to 15 times.<br />
Grasping Tendrils (All): Damage reduced in all difficulties (to about 1/3rd of what it used to be). Slow reduced on heroic to 35% (down from 50%)<br />
<br />
Dragonsoul Trash Mobs:<br />
Exploding Boulder: Inflicts 19500 to 20500 (down from 34125 to 35875) Physical damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i don't understand. European notation?? why would they use European notation on JUST the mage patch notes and not on the other patch notes for the other classes where they correctly used standard decimal points?? because if that is indeed European notation than they did infact ONLY use it on the mage patch notes and not the other classes... so i highly doubt it's european notation, However i also HIGHLY doubt it is a typo because it seems unlikely they would typo twice in a row for both pyroblast and fireball. What else could this comma mean? since the comma appears only on this current revision of the patch note and not on the original patch note where it doesn't even have decimals its just a solid 6% one would think perhaps they are reducing it down to the latter number after the comma , . who knows. just my 2c</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL.... um, no, they didn't. I love how people who know nothing of the hunter class and where it is sitting atm, whom come in a spout comments like this. -_-<br />
<br />
So they buffed hunters by 700AP, which is about 1/2 of what they should have gotten along with the melee in getting the 20% AP bonus (up from 10%) (Oh and FA in the great scheme of things and how well they scale, but any buff is appreciated). There would be no way that they would buff hunters to compete with a legendary, what would the point of them be then. They are trying (I assume) to bring them up a little closer to the middle of the pack of those without a legendary, not the bottom.</div></div><hr />

There is a world outside the US that doesn't always do things exactly the way you're used to. In this case we write 6.2 as 6,2 - either way is correct and means the same. It's not being changed from 6 to 3, that would have been written in a much clearer way.</div></div><hr />

Why is it &quot;Good&quot;? If your raid group has one (if not many), which most raids certainly do - it just made your group that much weaker.<br />
People that were being sat before (if so), will remain there (fire will still be top or near top dps). So, how does this benefit you in any way?<br />
<br />
I love how you fools wish nerfs upon certain PvE specs, just because your own personal DPS doesn't match up. <br />
Instead of looking for buffs to your own class, you would rather another get nerfed; quite pathetic if you ask me.<br />

Note: This coming from someone who Doesn't raid as Fire and was perfectly fine with others utilizing it, even if it was superior.</div></div><hr />

You're reading too much into this. These are not official patch notes (blue) but Boubouilles's patch notes (green). He is european, so 6,2% is just his way of writing 6.2%. Both are correct.<br />
In the later part of the post, commas are used the american way (&quot;280,000 shadow damage&quot;) but I think this is because Boub quoted that part directly out of the dungeon journal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's even worse. Since the base damage is lowered, the maximum crit will also be lower, since your magnitude of crit damage is dependant on the magnitude of the base damage. <br />
<br />
Sorry, people who want fire mages to be nerfed like this are plain stupid. The correct option is, as the quote sais, to reduce the delta, not the basis. When I'm playing fire, there are bossfights which are great, because I'm critting all the time - and then there are others, which are depressing because I almost never get some crit and my damage sinks into the abyss. <br />
<br />
What is it with Blizz and RNG for fire mages? I thought, Fire was about sustainable damage, movement, dots, and AoE - compared to Arcane (single-target, bursty, stationary) and Frost (gimmicks, pet, survivability). Don't they get their own class definitions right? Of course, this will lead only to bulls**t.</div></div><hr />
