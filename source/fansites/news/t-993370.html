Blizz: &amp;*^$*$<br />

Seriously, knock it off. Set bonus is fine. Fury chance is going to be significantly lower than arms anyways because arms already refreshes CS. Fury doesn't. Giving it roughly the same chance per second for fury as arms (would have to be 8.666% then) would be overpowered because you'd have a lot less wasted procs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you wonder why you received an infraction? It's perfectly reasonable for Death Knights to want to see their tier, especially after this long.<br />
<br />
OT: I like the Holy Priest changes, and the Warrior 4p is so low because you can use Bloodthirst about twice as much as you can use Mortal strike, so it has about half the proc chance. Now, if I were Blizzard, I would make it 10/20% (bt/ms) instead of 6/13%, but that's just me...<br />
<br />
I still don't know how I feel about that loot role/roll change. As my friend put it &quot;Messing with RNG is a slippery slope, who knows what other reasons they could use to influence the RNG system&quot; But, at the same time, I hate when I lose things to tanks. Oh well.</div></div><hr />

Yes: /roll 100 No: /roll 80 Folks wanting gear for a role they aren't currently playing are SLIGHTLY disadvantaged vs those who are needing for the spec they are currently playing as. Sensible move imo. It still lets people get gear they need for other specs without screwing those who want gear for the spec they are currently playing.<br />
<br />
That sounds good in theory, and if you are talking about 5 mans, it will work. The problem is that with the LFR, most tanks will be rolling against 5-10 other people. It doesn´t indicate how big the ´bonus´will be.. but even if it is 50%, the tank is still going to lose tanking gear frequently against that many strangers. LFR is going to have longer queues than 5 mans just because every time a tank rolls for loot, he is going to see 10 people roll against him. <br />
<br />
The solution is to add a 4th roll ´need for offspec´.. which only lights up for people who have a tank spec. They get priority over other dps, but can´t roll need against the current tank.<br />

3. She has scaring and bags under her eyes.<br />
4. Still wearing the say dress, but as you can see now the color looks rather dingy (can we say Tide w/Bleach)<br />

Placeholder models are always models existing in prior patches. Blizzard never implemented unfinished models to PTRs. Azshara's was a new model, unique to 4.3, not a placeholder. Her change is a clear result of community reaction.</div></div><hr />

as mercadi said. if you really think they werent going to just use that model you are sorely mistaken. you cant tell me that they would make a new model for azshara and use it as a placeholder. the model is exactly the same as it was, they just swapped some colors around to make it more lore accurate. the changes are clearly based on peoples feedback/criticism on the older colors.<br />
<br />
now lets see if they will make the well bigger......but that is pushing it since that would take alot more work than just swapping some colors.....oh well. im just happy to be getting a war of the ancients dungeon in game finally</div></div><hr />

So you don't want to tank because you don't want people rolling against you and taking your tanking gear, but you're just fine with taking another tanks gear while you are in DPS spec. Yep, makes perfect sense. :rolleyes: :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with the idea that there should be a separate off-spec roll that is lower priority than your main spec but I am not sure that I agree that overly sensitive tanks who dont want to be rolled against will be holding up the LFR queues. LFD in 5 mans gets held up on tanks because you need one tank for every 3 dps/1 healer. LFR you are only going to need 2 tanks for every 17 dps/6 healers. If anything I think it might be the tanks that actually end up waiting longer on this one, but we will never know till we get to see it live.<br />
<br />
Also, overly sensitive might sound harsh but everyone in the raid is already dealing with having to be rolled against for their gear. Dps lose to healers and tanks with off specs on top of having to roll against a higher number of people, healers lose to dps and tanks all the time too. Its something that we all have to deal with in pugs.</div></div><hr />

Yeahhh, the previous color scheme just looked nicer overall. For the sake of following lore from the novels, all they had to do was change her hair to a silvery white, perhaps with a faint cyan cast, and make her eyes golden instead of shimmery blue. And definitely not that bright marigold color, a faint bronze hue would have sufficed. This new version is nowhere near what I would call the most beautiful of all night elves. =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's from coding. In most C-like languages, all variables are represented by %d (double) and %s (string). The actual value and what variable is represented is hidden in pointers that point to the memory location of said saved variable. So this is in fact no mathematical equation, but you just replace the %d by the roll number and the %s by the strings for the item name (1st) and player name (2nd).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not an equation, it's a formatting string for a printout to the chat pane. %s would be the contents of a string like player_name or item_name and %d would be a decimal number.</div></div><hr />

I agree, I am sure this will only cause more people to roll &quot;need&quot; on offset pieces because &quot;main spec rollers have roll bonus anyway&quot;. <br />
<br />
IMHO this is not a very good solution, because random(100) can still be greater than random(100)+bonus. So while mainspec rollers have better probablility of getting the item, the system relies on the damned RNG instead on who actually needs the item most.</div></div><hr />

because if it was something like 30 and you are an healer that rolls an item for 50+30 (80) and a ninja rolls need 81 without any bonus, the ninja would win. <br />
<br />
if it's 100 then for every class with the same role is like doing /roll 101 - 200 <br />
everyone else rolls /roll 1 - 100 <br />
this way if a ninja rolls 80 and the correct role rolls 20, the latter wins.<br />

If i wanted to ninja-loot something I could still choose my role when it's time to roll and get the bonus :P<br />

That's not the point. We know your INTENTION was to quote something, except you did not make it clear it was a quotation. You have to actually use the quote function to make it clear you're quoting someone, like I'm doing right now to quote you.

Seriously, knock it off. Set bonus is fine. Fury chance is going to be significantly lower than arms anyways because arms already refreshes CS. Fury doesn't.

The % thingies are placeholders, and the charachter(s) following the % indicate what type of data will be put there.<br />

Because you will be raiding loads of FL with T13?<br />

Yep, makes perfect sense. :rolleyes: :confused:<br />
<br />
eh.. i was being hypothetical... but I really do think a lot of tanks are not going to want to tank a raid if they are rolling against 10 other people for tanking gear. In guild runs, tanks get priority, in 5 mans, pug tanks only have to roll against one dps usually. It will definitely get frustrating as a tank to constantly see pure tanking gear get rolled against by so many different people. It is just easier to go in as a dps and be stress-free and roll on the same loot.<br />
<br />
so.. taking bets on how long until CTA comes to LFR<br />

<br />
Except we don't know how big the role bonus actually is. It might be +100, for all we know.<br />
<br />
If the role bonus is 99% or more, it is exactly what we already have. Since Blizzard has constantly said that they like the fact that off-roles can roll need, I think the bonus is going to be small..10-25%. I am sure someone with better math skills than me can calculate this. 11 people make rolls, one person gets a bonus 50.. what are his chances of winning? My guess is it is around 40%ish. With 10 offspecs rolling, someone should get in the 90s, and then there is a 50% chance the tank rolls under 50... but even then, I doubt the bonus is going to be 50%.<br />
<br />
Even if you get to the point where 10 people each have a 7% chance to win, and the tank has a 30% chance to win, the tank is still going to lose 70% of the time on tanking gear. And I think 10 people rolling is low, as others have said, the psychology of this change will cause more people to roll need than would have otherwise.</div></div><hr />

What I'd love to see as an added option to the PUG loot rules, would be an option to exclude someone who wins an item from further rolls, until all others of the same class role have also won something. Instead of worst case 1 A-hole rolling on everything, including maybe stuff he doesn't plan to use as an upgrade at all.<br />
<br />
Edit: Maybe allow someone who queues as Raid Leader to customize the loot rules as well? Only within reason, no one should for example be able to disable the class-role restriction, but be able to add a fairness rule like the one i sugested.</div></div><hr />

Giving it roughly the same chance per second for fury as arms (would have to be 8.666% then) would be overpowered because you'd have a lot less wasted procs.<br />
<br />
First of all, I like the change to BT rather than RB because of the mechanic behind fury.<br />
<br />
If you proc a CS off RB you will not have RB off cd ever, meaning you would only be able to use 2 BTs and possibly a slam (if you're lucky) and any obvious HS.<br />
<br />
RB (Proc) 0 - BT at 1.5 - Open at 3.0 - BT at 4.5 - RB at 6 (if proc works very kindly and your rotation is not delayed by lag).<br />
<br />
But now that it is off of CS, you can guarantee 1 RB and 1 BT with a free GCD. The potential for 2 BTs exist depending on how the proc works, so an ideal occurance of this will net 2 BTs and 1 RB guaranteed.<br />
<br />
BT (Proc) 0 - RB at 1.5 (if avail, else open), BT at 3.0, RB/Open at 4.5, BT at 6.0 (if proc is nice, as above).<br />
<br />
So, it's a slight rotational improvement but mostly it's better because we don't do 1 RB for every 2 BTs.<br />
<br />
However, when you compare a value between Fury and Arms and mention that Fury would have &quot;a lot less wasted procs&quot; this is simply false.<br />
<br />
Sudden Death resets the CD of Colossus Smash, it doesn't activate it. The only time you can have a 'wasted' proc is if you activate your proc DURING a CS. This would be an overlapped, or wasted, proc.<br />
<br />
But! Both fury and arms have the same chance of wasting a proc while it is currently up. If Sudden Death procs while your proc is up, it's not wasted, as you still receive the CS reset.<br />
<br />
With that said, I find it fairly telling that it's obvious that Fury has a lower chance of using the tier 4 proc right out of the starting blocks.<br />
<br />
As you said, 8.6666666% would be the equivalent for Fury. So comparing arms to fury here would yield a better 4 piece arms proc than fury.<br />
<br />
No reason to try to defend it, arms is sub par to fury in the last patch, if this is aimed as a balance between the two, I dislike the idea of balancing arms vs fury by giving fury low proc rates.<br />
<br />
I'd rather have the proc on the same level and simply buff arms in other ways that doesn't make playing Fury less interesting.</div></div><hr />

If you see it like each hit of BT has 6% chance is still a 12% chance in total. thats not the case here. Bloodthirst is one hit. It doesnt increase your proc chance by 2x just because you have two weapons. RB in other hand is different since it does a RB Off-hand damage as well. It does two hits. Bloodthirst isnt the same =(. I dont know how often the proc will work but this is just fucking ridiculous. 6% is not really a high number</div></div><hr />

It's nice that they changed her eyes and hair to fit lore, and those parts look okay, but the blue-green skin and pink gems/tattoos are a bit too... gaudy.</div></div><hr />
