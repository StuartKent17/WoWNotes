Shaman community perception vs. reality<br />
I don’t mean to harp on you not specifically mentioning enhance. But I am constantly getting told enhance doesn’t bring enough cleave to be invited to a group. Note, not a mention of my skill, but of the class itself. I am pretty good at enhance, i am pretty bad at ele. But my god can ele do some amazing cleave and aoe dmg. Enhance… um… no? I get that there is and should be differences, but the gap seems too wide, no?<br />
<br />
Right now that’s an issue with the perception of Shamans. numbers wise shamans can put them up, both Elemental and Enhancement, however the perception of Shamans in 8.0 has led to you guys into having a harder time when in reality you’re perfectly viable. I wish I had a solution to this right now but its something we’re aware of and know it becomes a problem if a class is known as “struggling”. One of those unfortunate WoW things when it comes to community discussion on viability that has existed since Vanilla.<br />
<br />
Little off topic from OPs original post but just letting you know its something we’re aware of.<br />

Blizzard CFO Hired by Square<br />
Blizzard Entertainment's CFO Amrita Ahuja has been hired by Square, Inc. This comes one week after the CFO of Activision Blizzard (Blizzard's parent company), Spencer Neumann, was hired by Netflix (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8247-Frightened-Kodo-Mount-Blue-Posts-Activision-Blizzard-CFO-Hired-by-Netflix-DLC-661).

Former top Hearthstone designers making a Marvel game<br />
Former Hearthstone director Ben Brode and a group of colleagues left Blizzard last year to start a game studio called Second Dinner (https://seconddinner.com/). They announced they've received $30 million in funding from Chinese game company NetEase, who is also a co-developer on the upcoming Diablo Immortal mobile game. They will be making a game set in the Marvel universe. Click the banner for more information courtesy of Kotaku.<br />

The more likely scenario is that they put her in charge of development planning, and then BFA got crushed in its reception, and Diablo Immortal spawned meme ridicule the likes the world has never seen. Then in a surprising coincidence, she accepted a job at a different company and got the hell out of Dodge before the fallout hit completely.<br />

It's Netease, so a Chinese mobile game was basically a given<br />
<br />
In way, I guess you could say Ben Brode got poached from Hearthstone to make a mobile game (primarily for China) using the Marvel license. Likely will also be a card game<br />

<br />
Maybe Blizzard was butchering themself and the cost cutting was needed to even survive. You guys doesnt even know were they are cutting costs. Maybe the are cutting costs by not starting questionable project over and over again and put more money into their working games like WoW. If the Diablo article a couple of weeks ago is even halfway true it shows how many projects they start in a single francise without finishing it. Alot of game studios died with their second failed project.<br />
<br />
I know its cool to downtalk everything new and hype up all the old stuff. But we dont know what is going on inside of Blizzard and even if we knew, probably no one of us is competent enough to make better desicions.</div></div><hr />

Fate/Grand Order and Fire Emblem Heroes are pretty well-designed games (F/GO's gacha is notoriously stingy, but the free characters are designed well enough that all you really need is Cu and Hans to steamroll the entire game with preparation), credit where due.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not that uncommon but also not really common due to restrains people with &quot;C&quot; in their job position have while signing contract. <br />
<br />
there is a reason why they are paid milions of $$ monthly and have extraordinary &quot;golden parachutes&quot; then their contracts are terminated prematurly - because very often their contracts include clauses of for example not working for 2-3 years in the same industry after leaving company X before contract is fullfilled.. <br />
<br />
in those cases its pretty obvious that their contracts run out and after collecting juicy yearly bonuses they swapped jobs to even better paying ones.<br />
<br />
most of conspiracy nuts who whine about activision have no clue how real world works . at certain level if you are really good at your job you dont give any fucks if comapny will fire you or looses money (if its not your fault ofc ) because there are 3-4 others just waiting to recruit you . its usually the corporate drones and middle managment who worry about their positions.</div></div><hr />

Tis why I never feel bad when I hear of a CEO, CFO, or other higher up getting canned. They get huge amount of money when they get fired for being incompotent at their job. Then there's another job hiding in the weeds for them to go to as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah that tends to happen. People seem to get upset, too, if you're playing a &quot;bad&quot; spec and pull better number than them. It isn't that they're bad either, it's that they assume your spec is and feel bad because they figure they should be vastly outperforming your spec instead of being closely comparable. <br />
<br />
I used to main Shadow, and it was something that would come up even among guildies. &quot;Ugh why can't I beat you in damage on this fight wtf I'm having such an off week&quot; No, it's cause there is 3 targets all fight and I'm multidotting, it's basically what my spec is for, and your spec is better at single target.</div></div><hr />

The numbers just didn't add up. If they were, pros and streamers would have played them in WF race, raider.io 1st page etc.<br />
<br />
Yep. It's a complete load of horseshit coming from guilty devs that promised changes since last expansion and rightfully admitted enhance could use some love. Now all of the sudden, enhance performs well but it's the player's fault for perceiving it as a weak spec? You don't just wake up one day and perceive something as a weak spec. Reputation builds up over time, and rightfully so. Enhance is shite and these cunts are guilty for procrastinating changes for a good 2 patches now, so they're shifting the blame on the community.<br />
<br />
<br />
To add to it all, they actually nerfed it to the ground in pvp. Because being shit in pve wasn't good enough. The pvp fix only required a balance to the damage pvp talents, not completely neutering the spec with no defensives by taking away healing too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, there's an issue with your perception of Shamans. Ele Shaman simply aren't fun. I don't care about the competitive numbers. It is an unwieldy spec most of the time that can, at times, shine and, just as often, fall flat on their faces because of the unwieldiness.<br />
<br />
I've played since Vanilla Beta, and have typically mained an Ele Shaman since the start of BC...or, worst case, had him as my primary alt. This is the first expansion where it has been such a terrible playing spec that he's not even on my top 5 alt list anymore. 8.1 pushed his numbers up a bit, but it is still the same unwieldy and unfun spec since the beginning of the expansion.<br />
<br />
Ele Shaman was far better in Legion, and I don't think that was a particularly great expansion for them. But for some reason you decided to take away every tool that made Ele Shaman interesting and flexible.<br />
<br />
Stop trying to rationalize your bad decisions and start understanding that most of us don't play the game to be high on the ego charts (aka dps charts). We want to have fun and feel like we are contributing...you've taken that away and have demonstrated no ability to understand the damage you've done.<br />

There's backlash in the West, but mobile is still growing in the East. Chinas the biggest player in this. Mobile games are all their government wants them to play (consoles were banned from 2000 to 2015) It's engrained in their culture.

In the West, we can at least get people to wise up and not waste their money on RMT games, and add some legal restrictions, but it's not going anywhere unfortunately. (like alcohol, cigarettes, etc)<br />

In the US maybe but in the EU you have to deal with EU regulations &amp; laws on top of the regulations &amp; laws of the individual member states.<br />
And some (not all) of the countries here are well sorry to say but not as politically backwards with regards to technology as the US is and these countries also tend to have strict laws with regards to gambling which loot boxes fall under. Also selling a product without in advance warning their potential customers that the game they are about to buy is incomplete ie season passes, bank tabs, xp boosts etc via micro transactions can be perceived as deception and be deemed very illegal indeed.</div></div><hr />

I don't think China has any desire to fix any perceived issues with mobile really, other than loot boxes/gambling. They still have no sense of copyright either. China does what China wants.<br />
<br />
China does have some loot box rules now, like in Hearthstone it made them disclose the pack rates. Even so, mobile isn't going anywhere for them. We just have to accept that mobile and console gaming are both going to be a major thing. That's just the East though. Hopefully the West will still fight the good fight, but I wonder about the next generation of gamers that raised with mobile device in mind from the get go.

The Chinese have a sense of copyright, don't be silly. They became a member of WIPO, and on paper, western/foreign copyrights have protections there, it's just getting them enforced in courts that can be troublesome. It's a vastly complex issue, but to say they don't have a &quot;sense&quot; of copyright is simply not true and naive at best. There's just issues enforcing foreign rights there (mostly from corruption in local politicians). Educate yourself, there is a vast amount of information and discussion of the topic online. <br />
<br />
Business in China is a strange thing, because of their mix of capitalism and a communist government. I'm not a fan of them, I'm not supportive of them, but I have worked with many people who do business there, and have learned how things actually work there.</div></div><hr />

They became a member of WIPO, and on paper, western/foreign copyrights have protections there, it's just getting them enforced in courts that can be troublesome. It's a vastly complex issue, but to say they don't have a &quot;sense&quot; of copyright is simply not true and naive at best. There's just issues enforcing foreign rights there (mostly from corruption in local politicians). Educate yourself, there is a vast amount of information and discussion of the topic online. <br />
<br />
Business in China is a strange thing, because of their mix of capitalism and a communist government. I'm not a fan of them, I'm not supportive of them, but I have worked with many people who do business there, and have learned how things actually work there.<br />
<br />
So when did China last care about a foreign company's copyright? It's not that complex. They're corrupt to the core and care only about China.<br />

I'm just sad that the way forward for games recently seems to be crappy mobile ones made by Asian companies that are riddled with MTX rather than providing a fun experience.<br />

Once that is fixed, why bother playing on a phone?<br />
<br />
Because mobile games are being played on long commutes which are up to 2 hours each way on trains in not only China but South Korea and Japan. Add also Taiwan and other markets which use similar commute methods in the east unless you're going to suggest setting up consoles and pcs on trains the mobile market is just the best way to game for the situation out there.</div></div><hr />

I wish I had a solution to this right now but its something we’re aware of and know it becomes a problem if a class is known as “struggling”. One of those unfortunate WoW things when it comes to community discussion on viability that has existed since Vanilla.<br />
<br />
I would like to see those numbers. Number wise sims show enhance doesn't even come close. Number wise gameplay I've seen doesn't even come close. Number wise when I played enhance it doesn't even come close. Either I'm pressing crash lightning and SS wrong, or they're using an excuse that they won't prove and we can't see.</div></div><hr />

It would be the epitome of awesome if china banned blizzard games, Their entire diablo immortal would fail so hard, its 100% made for the chinese market. Without that market, it would burn<br />
With the new Social credit system the Chinese govt introduced, they dont really have to ban the games. Yoy get negative social credits for simply playing video games. You loose enough social credit your internet , such as it is, is taken away and then you are labeled a Criminal . People will be to afraid to play video games<br />

I will have to say we should wait to see what happens with mobile games. They could very well be a fad but they could also become the next big thing.<br />
There have been plenty of fad style systems and peripherals, such as Wii’s motion controls. Lasted a long time but for the most part it is no where near the popularity it once was.<br />
There have also been others that have lasted forever, such as mobile gaming that started becoming huge with Gameboy.<br />
As for people saying phones will never be powerhouses, we simply have to look to the past. The first computer to ever play a successful game was the size of a small room with a monitor that looked like a porthole (if I remember the picture correctly).<br />

<br />
Blizzard is basically telling us that &quot;it's all in our head&quot; and that &quot;we should take their word for it&quot;. In context that makes sense and is fine, but out of context (partially, to be fair) this bugs the hell out of me. And I really don't take everything the dev team at their word to begin with, nor do I have complete faith in their abilities. I would at least like to know where they are drawing these conclusions from. <br />

Flame me if you must for saying so, but I miss Ghostcrawler's posts where they discussed the changes they were going to make with the community so we'd be on the same page.

True, but VR has pretty much died off. It was looking to be this new big thing but has slowly been dying off. VR itself is something that companies have tried to make a big thing but keeps failing. That said, I’m not trying to point out VR is gone because that would be untrue, but it has certainly lost momentum thru lack of quality games and cost of making said games. Hell, PS4 has had 1 game that truly showcased its capabilities out of a few dozen. Other style Vr headsets for computer and portable phones have had their fun, but none have truly taken off as the next big thing.<br />
Switch might have motion control, but again, how many games utilize it effectively and as it’s only source.<br />
Again, I’m not stating something is gone or dead, but none of these things have become a big todo. If they had we’d have quality VR games, almost every single game would have motion controls, and we wouldn’t have this debate of phone games.</div></div><hr />

I got VR as a gift. I didn't plan on getting it for the same reasons people are saying here. I thought it was a gimmick. But damn, it is one of the best things I've ever experienced. I can't wait to see what the future has in store for VR because it's going to be out-freaking-standing. You don't get it yet, but you will one day. Beat Saber is such a fantastic experience. Thrill of the Fight, while a little rough due to being made by one person, is great. Lone Echo is 100% outstanding (best movement type of all VR games, too).<br />
<br />
Yeah, VR headsets run 350 (at least the oculus including 2 sensors). After playing it, I loved it and bought a 3rd sensor and stands to put them on. You don't need a 30 sq ft. room. 3mx3m is the minimum required, and I'm able to do it in my very small room filled mostly by bed and desk. Most games have some type of locomotion so you're not actually walking around. It would be nice to have a larger space for it, but it is totally far more than double than without it. Some games are better than others (Beat Saber doesn't need a lot of space, Thrill of the Fight needs more, and Holopoint would do better with at least 7x7 imo). There are many games you can play sitting down (cockpit games).<br />
<br />
But yeah, when you actually play VR, you'll experience something you never have before. I actually played it in a commercial environment at first. If there is a VOID around you (you can find one at downtown disney), they have VR games in a warehouse environment, and that really opened my eyes up to VR.<br />
<br />
This is not just a gimmick. This will be a major future in gaming. This isn't like 3D stuff. This is legit and will only get better.</div></div><hr />
