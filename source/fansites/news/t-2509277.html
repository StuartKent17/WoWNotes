I see this new mentality creeping into feedback. &quot;Yeah, we know it's broken/an exploit, but it's fun so leave it alone&quot;<br />
<br />
What people fail to think about in an MMO environment though is that today's fun, is tomorrow's ruined server economy. It's not about having fun today, it's about making sure the game is in a healthy state 3 weeks from now.</div></div><hr />

it will, it bans the account based on that sub, wow classic is on the same sub as your live account.<br />
unless the people have 2 subs going, 1 for classic, and 1 for live wow, and have them seperated then no.<br />
<br />
<br />
cause mine for example has 2<br />
<br />
Fleplague 1: my main account<br />
felplague 2: a trail account i made on acident<br />
<br />
<br />
both my live charecters, and all my classic charecters are under &quot;felplague 1&quot; so if i was banned i would lose both<br />
but if i had all my charecters on felplague 2, and my classic on felplague 1, and one got banned, the other would be fine. but i would need 2 subs for that.<br />

the 2 are completly different,the xp thing was done by people just playing the game as intended,the guys abusing the layering to respawn bosses in their face....remember in cata 4.3 when ret paladins had a crazy dps increase bug?no one got banned or punished,because the bug was caused by normal gameplay<br />

dont compare this to those situations,the xp thing and layer thing doesnt even qualify as an exploit,the xp was a bug and people were just playing normaly,nothing to punish for that,and layering in the case of farming was 100% working as intended,but blizzard just caved after all the complaning and changed it</div></div><hr />

You cannot get &quot;100k gold&quot; in 48 hours by killing a 5man dungeon boss over and over.<br />
<br />
Actually it's fairly possible due to the tailoring patterns that are best in slot, most of the server economies have been dumped due to this. Basically you would farm the pattern then float it way under for easy turnover and rinse and repeat. Initial server prices before this rolled out were 400-700 but now they're ~100. That alone would have gotten people thousands of gold. Also taking into account the three different patterns and people also buying up cheap epics in hope of flipping them for much higher, there would have been high demand. Then there's all the extra things you can farm using this, so guilds as a whole would have earned 100k gold. Players who completely no life'd and rand the dungeons over and over could have made a few k especially if they saw the value of their items as part of that net worth increase.<br />
<br />
It's a bit sad because Blizzard said they were &quot;on top&quot; of layer exploits and that people couldn't abuse the system but it's clear they just lie through their teeth at this stage. Classic has shown to be a bust just due to Blizzard's laziness, #nochanges was never a reality and they know they make way more out of micro transactions these days. Layering, leeway and no wall jumping has made this fairly mediocre from my expectations. I can't see a way for Blizzard to fix the economy after this one.</div></div><hr />

Yeah... probably in the same way like they had bags full of Black Lotuses and Arcane Crystals, right? :rolleyes:<br />

What is this nonsense?<br />
<br />
Demand doesn't magically increase. Having pattern doesn't magically increase amount of gold in economy. Massive supply only means that prices will go down, players will get it for cheap, but gold in economy will stay the same.<br />
<br />
Also there aren't that many layers to begin with. Instead of 1 pattern they'd get 3-4 on high populated realm. Layers aren't infinite, its not cross-realm farm that exists in retail. Use your brain before blowing whole thing out of proportion and believing fake screenshots.<br />

What excess gold? Why has economy been ruined? Economy is fine, gold didn't magically increase because some people got patterns. Supply of those patterns increased, that's all. Which means prices for those patterns decreased. Economy is fine.</div></div><hr />

It's similar, it's still breaking the game and, clearly, a bug.<br />
Bugs are in the game, that was part of Vanilla and in the spirit of #NoChanges the same sort of bugs are still in Classic.<br />
However taking these bugs and using them for any sort of gains is against Blizzard rules now and back then. Exploiting is and always has been punishable with rollbacks, character bans, account bans and so on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gold value =/= economy. A huge demand item with high value being oversupplied just sucked the gold from normal players who bought the item and also allowed exploiters and market manipulators to become whales. So yeah demand doesn't increase for a BiS item because it is already as high as it will get, yet the amount of gold and value that have been shifted have significantly impacted the game. There was enough layers to keep a steady flow of these, go watch the videos of people clearing this stuff. It's already the same with Devilsaurs and what not. The AH and economy have been completely destroyed by layering not just from instances. Players and guilds have even said they will actively horde for AQ once the initial wave settles. I like playing the AH more than any other aspect of the game and it's very clear this has impacted the economy dramatically. I'm not max level because I've been enjoying amassing gold and it's clear that huge amounts of money have shifted the balance of the economy. Like I've gotten a significant amount of value from these exploits and I haven't even been in the dungeons.<br />
<br />
I'd say layering was a huge failure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to hope they have more ways to actually figure out who abused it than visual inspections (wealth)<br />
Like boss kill tracking would be the dead give away.. where a player has somehow killed a unique dungeon npc dozens of times but barely killed the trash for more than a couple runs.<br />
<br />
We've seen bugs before, and I can completely get behind rationalising on the 1% (probably less) out of 100% taking advantage.. but people were talking about layering abuses (openly) months before classic launched, the people who took advantage of it on an industrial scale knew what they were doing and deserve an account/credit card ban (though I am not confident this will happen)<br />
<br />
And doing nothing/expecting what has been done to resolve itself, will inadvertently punish the remaining players in the long run.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AlexRS</div><div class="date">2019-09-16, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard only perma bans for serious exploits (duping for eg, even duping a vendor pet back in the day resulted in a perm ban), selling boosts for cash 6 months, buying boosts for cash (jaina mount for example was easily traceable at first = 1 month ban and mount/title removed). Exploits like repeat instance bug - a couple of days to a couple of weeks (like XP potion), botting 6 months first time, second time permanent, PvP account sharing 30 days ban and no participation in the next season.<br />
<br />
Also many exploits got unpunished or semi punished for example; <br />
<br />
Disable CRZ worked for 2 years nobody I know got in trouble, <br />
Grabbing mythic(heroic) boss titles from LFR defeats also got none in trouble, <br />
Instant respawn WQ AP farm in Legion did get people in trouble they kept all the AP gathered, <br />
Brawlers rank10 with Ra'sha sacrificial knife also got none banned, they just made the knife unusable - thats why many got rank10 during week1/2 of Brawlers guild back in the day.<br />
Infinite 25g gold per 2 seconds exploit recently got hotfixed, secret fish of Kun'lai had instant respawn and could be vendored infinitely, Blizzard simply removed vendor price.<br />
<br />
This is why the quote &quot;Exploit early, exploit often&quot; exists and this is why people abused dungeons and layering, 8/10 times you get away with it, 9/10 times its worth it even if you get caught, and maybe 1/100 times you get in serious trouble.<br />
<br />
I do not encourage exploiting - just stating facts based on history of WoW, as much as I love Blizzard they do a poor job at punishing people for abusing bugs, maybe they love their playerbase too much so there's that too..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard has had a policy for a very long time of not banning people, like before the expansions you're referring to. They had already adopted this policy in BC, and it was in full effect during Wrath (their best expansion in terms of subscriber count). <br />
<br />
It's not a subscriber issue.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has been very clear for years that they only use bans in the most dire circumstances. They're often fine with just fixing the problem and continuing on with life as usual, and if they do need to take action, they'll do a rollback or a temp suspension. Occasionally they'll do both.<br />
<br />
It's why all these calls for, &quot;OMG Blizz should ban!&quot; are kind of absurd. This just isn't a bannable offense to begin with, according to Blizzard. Unless people are doing things like using external cheating tools multiple times, or are clearly hacking/gold selling accounts, Blizzard just doesn't ban.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Layering&quot; yet another Blizz Idea which looked good on paper, but was very poorly designed and had even worse implementation, no forethought at all was put into this, they just put it in live solely to get more subs and revenue, nothing they have done these last 2 x-pacs has been properly thought through, this is what you get when the devs we now have these days have no idea what they are doing, they don't even play the game, and certainly they have no idea how players will react to content...just so out of touch.<br />

<br />
I disagree with the &quot;slightly&quot; faster lvling. It was a lot faster. Instead of 5% XP per player (10 man raid grp) you got 14%, that is nearly 3 times as much as in Vanilla, because the raid penality was not given and the grp XP bonus for 5 man grps was added. 110% is a bit faster, 280% is insanely fast.<br />
<br />
I call triple XP (2.8 to be exact) a TON FASTER.<br />
<br />
Also not infinite gear. It is mostly BOP gear that you can farm like 5-10 times (based on layers) without having to do the trash again (just one boss not all). So it is a lot faster (or mounts) but not even close to infinite gear.<br />
<br />
So you play the one exploit down by a lot and the other one up to infinite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, and have like 100 players in a zone trying to farm the same 20 mobs. It is already a mess to lvl in Strangle right now, make it 10 times as many players and you can't play.<br />
<br />
Your solution sucks. It solves the exploiter problem by making the game unplayable outside of instances.<br />

<br />
hmmm, most people are still lving, playing normally, not taking any exploits and don't care much about the economy that isn't really hit by the exploits yet. No challenging engame was clear from the start (the first challenging raid was AQ).<br />
<br />
So I don't see any problem. Still better than retail where you run around alone doing things you do to get better gear that is crap later on anyways. In classic you run aound, lvl, find new friends and that's it. In the end in both games you have nothing ingame of value, but in classic you at last get some social interactions done.<br />
<br />
Classic is fun for the ones that look for an MMO where you play together. <br />
Retail is fun for the ones that look to raid mythic or the ones that want to kill their brains.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, and have like 100 players in a zone trying to farm the same 20 mobs. It is already a mess to lvl in Strangle right now, make it 10 times as many players and you can't play.<br />
<br />
Your solution sucks. It solves the exploiter problem by making the game unplayable outside of instances.<br />

hmmm, most people are still lving, playing normally, not taking any exploits and don't care much about the economy that isn't really hit by the exploits yet. No challenging engame was clear from the start (the first challenging raid was AQ).<br />
<br />
So I don't see any problem. Still better than retail where you run around alone doing things you do to get better gear that is crap later on anyways. In classic you run aound, lvl, find new friends and that's it. In the end in both games you have nothing ingame of value, but in classic you at last get some social interactions done.<br />
<br />
Classic is fun for the ones that look for an MMO where you play together. <br />
Retail is fun for the ones that look to raid mythic or the ones that want to kill their brains.<br />
<br />
Instance leveling is how I have played the gams since I started in January 05, I play the game for the instance content and the second they are available that Is how I level so this sounds like a pretty good fix to me. I tried leveling with Quests and F that noise everything is 4+ levels above me and a pain in the ass to kill.</div></div><hr />

It was a lot faster. Instead of 5% XP per player (10 man raid grp) you got 14%, that is nearly 3 times as much as in Vanilla, because the raid penality was not given and the grp XP bonus for 5 man grps was added. 110% is a bit faster, 280% is insanely fast.<br />
<br />
I call triple XP (2.8 to be exact) a TON FASTER.<br />
<br />
Also not infinite gear. It is mostly BOP gear that you can farm like 5-10 times (based on layers) without having to do the trash again (just one boss not all). So it is a lot faster (or mounts) but not even close to infinite gear.<br />
<br />
So you play the one exploit down by a lot and the other one up to infinite.<br />
<br />
The thing you quoted should say &quot;If you are &quot;Farming&quot; then you go outside the dungeon and reset and then go again. You don't try to do something that reset the last boss while you are still in the room &quot; I dono why you changed it to say something else.. or even what it is you are on about.</div></div><hr />

That's the real problem - the penalties are not harsh enough. As long as you can do a risk assessment and come out ahead (often quite substantially), the incentive to cheat remains. It's like fining a company $2m dollars for cutting corners, but they make $10m profit because they did so. That only tells them IT'S WORTH IT.<br />
<br />
Anyone who is knowingly and blatantly exploiting should just be permanently banned. Killing an instance boss 100 times in a row is not a case of &quot;oops this just happened&quot;, nobody who did this can claim they didn't know it was wrong. They knew it was. And they did it anyway. We don't need people like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Infinite stone in Legion or AP in BfA were quite easily abused too. So it is blizz not the players? Knowing that this was truly wrong.<br />
It's like leaving your door key under plant pot and going on holiday.

It was reported during the Beta that the XP gain seemed too high. Blizzard either never looked into the report(s) or just didn't care until people complained because watching streamers farm SM for 18 hours isn't enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

You would need other players to buy those tailoring patterns. I don't think 1 person managed to sell 100,000 gold worth of 1% drop chance patterns in a 48 hour period. It is not &quot;fairly possible&quot; in the slightest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The drop rate is ~10% and no one person didn't sell 100,000g worth of patterns. Players were saying they had upwards of 10k, so they would have had to of sold 25 patterns which isn't inconceivable especially on a populated server. If they were flipping them quickly than maybe 40, again not that big of a deal. There were also people farming chests in instances which would have again ruined the economy. I don't understand how people don't get this.</div></div><hr />

Classic is fun for the ones that look for an A) MMO where you play together. <br />
Retail is fun B) for the ones that look to raid or the ones that C) want to kill their brains.<br />
<br />
A) People have been meeting and making friends in this game just fine 13 years past Muhnilla, fyi.<br />
B) Normal/HC/Mythic/Do M+/Do Organized PVP, all of which you do with other organized players. Then there's the casual stuff like LFR, Normal/HC dungeons, collectibles, Islands, Warfronts, WQs, Max level Zone gameplay etc etc, all of which is done amongst other players at the very least, before counting friends grouping. <br />
C) I wasn't aware that Classic requires exceptional people in... well, any content.<br />
<br />
Oh you people. Can't even keep the contradictions in check.<br />
Classic is for people who prefer the gameplay of that time.<br />
Retail is for players who prefer the gameplay of the present. And yes, to some players, both versions are desirable. <br />
<br />
The game still remains an MMORPG for a fact, and that means other players no matter how you spin it. <br />
<br />
And yes, Retail is happy to accommodate the crowd that just wants to hop in, play the game, then log out, be it due to social anxiety or just not having any interest in meeting people. And that's fine too. Literally nothing's put in place that forces players not to be social though. Nothing.</div></div><hr />

no it's fucking not lol<br />
<br />
The epic tailoring chest patterns that drop off of endbosses? No, it is not anywhere near &quot;10%&quot;. It's more like 1%. If they were truly a &quot;~10%&quot; drop chance, they would not sell for more than 10-20 gold each. Maybe even less.<br />
<br />
<br />

Basically you would farm the pattern then float it way under for easy turnover and rinse and repeat. Initial server prices before this rolled out were 400-700 but now they're ~100. That alone would have gotten people thousands of gold. Also taking into account the three different patterns and people also buying up cheap epics in hope of flipping them for much higher, there would have been high demand. Then there's all the extra things you can farm using this, so guilds as a whole would have earned 100k gold. Players who completely no life'd and rand the dungeons over and over could have made a few k especially if they saw the value of their items as part of that net worth increase.<br />
<br />
It's a bit sad because Blizzard said they were &quot;on top&quot; of layer exploits and that people couldn't abuse the system but it's clear they just lie through their teeth at this stage. Classic has shown to be a bust just due to Blizzard's laziness, #nochanges was never a reality and they know they make way more out of micro transactions these days. Layering, leeway and no wall jumping has made this fairly mediocre from my expectations. I can't see a way for Blizzard to fix the economy after this one.<br />
<br />
Just because it may be probable I still haven‚Äôt see a shred of evidence anywhere hinting that players reached absurd amounts of gold anywhere.</div></div><hr />

Stage because a lot of streamers have said the opposite. They don't actually made new friends or met people while playing while they did in classic. And I can say that same about me and most people I know. In retail you play and have a small grp you know and that's it. You dont care about anyone else because they don't really affect you at all.<br />
<br />
Normal/HC doesn't require much organization. Mythic and PvP yes but even there you mostly have smaller grps that are fixed. You don't just meet new players or get something unexpected.<br />
<br />
And Classic doesn't require exceptional people. Retail does. It requires people that do the same things without any goal. they play nearly a normal RGP just with coop and a worse story telling and no choices for story changes and pay for it each month and without an end. Retail is a mess of a game. Classic is not a ton better, but it at least has some room for adventures and more forced social interactions when Retail is exactly what you except, doing the same things over and over for the same stuff for years, pretty much like working all the time except you never get promoted.<br />

<br />
If you do quests with mobs 4 lvls above you, why do you do it? There are quests with mobs at your lvl or below. but not all people want to farm instances, especially when it is normally slower (except with the raid exploit). Doing the same content over and over just becomes boring really fast for most players. Questing, meeting others outside and getting into unexpected situations is the fun in classic. Just farming instances or rushing to 60 ASAP means you ignore like 80% of the current game.</div></div><hr />

Look around you, after that short amount of time classic is already a shitshow: Two viable classes for dungeonfarming, raidexploits, broken economy, literaly no endgame that is challenging, etc.<br />
<br />
You thought you wantend it...<br />

LMAO. I've been playing since 2006. 2x 60s on vanilla, 6 x 60s on PServers (all 1x XP rates). Nearly another 60 on Classic. Many more to come.<br />
<br />
Fantastic immersive world, flavourful and diverse classes and specs, gear that means something instead, just being an adventurer instead of the god-hero of all Azeroth (along with every other player), people who are happy to group and communicate with other, fantastic community...I could go on and on tbh.<br />

<br />
I think it originated as a result of weird design decisions that nobody understood, things that restricted the gameplay for just for the sake of restriction (or so the playerbase understood it). <br />
<br />
Good example would be the limitation to camera distance that was introduced in WoD I believe.</div></div><hr />
