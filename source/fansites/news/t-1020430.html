Patch 4.3: Deathwing Brings Raid to You!<br />
On the PTR, Deathwing lets you know he is ready to fight in Dragon Soul by visiting Orgrimmar and Stormwind and trying to burn them down! Keep in mind that this event took place early in testing and could turn out to be a PTR only event.<br />

MoP Intellect Change<br />
The way we see it, Intellect increases the power of your heals. Spirit (and other regeneration mechanics) replenishes your mana. Having Intellect also increase the size of your mana pool complicates things. It's harder to balance, and feels worse for players trying to balance their character.<br />
<br />
While we think the healer mana model for Cataclysm is sound and ultimately accomplished what we wanted, it was still a little too difficult for a on fresh level 85 just going into dungeons, and a little too easy for raiders. Part of that comes from what improved stats do for healers: they get bigger heals (from Intellect), the ability to cast more heals (larger mana pool), and the ability to cast those heals for a longer period of time without running out of mana (as a result of regen). Along the way, the tank and the group are take more damage from tougher bosses, but also have higher damage and higher survivability from improvements to their own gear.<br />
<br />
Please remember, the goal isn’t to make healers so resource-starved that they can’t heal. That isn’t fun. The goal is to reward healers who limit how much overhealing they do (in other words, play smarter) for their efforts. You limit your overhealing by doing things like casting a smaller heal when a smaller heal is sufficient, or casting a slower heal when death isn’t imminent, or casting a single-target heal when the group isn’t all taking damage at once. Skillful healers should prosper. When players feel like increasing their skill doesn’t increase their success, they tend to get bored or frustrated.

Stampede<br />
So, would it use our pets we have on hand or would it be more like the group of npc's we get when you do the Firelands daily at Sethria's Roost? Just some random animals. Would it use any of our pet's special abilities?<br />
<br />
We're talking about something that is completely hypothetical, so anything is possible. I personally would want the ability to call the five pets that I actually have on hand at the time, since that would give me control over what everyone sees when I send out the stampede.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it makes a lot of sense for the spell effects to not vary much from hunter to hunter, so special abilities would be right out, *but* I wouldn't mind seeing the pets going through their best motions.

Glyph of Inquisition feedback<br />
The intent is that it is not damage neutral. Yes, managing Inquisition should mean higher DPS, if you are exceptional at managing it. However, a lot of players find that they can’t operate their class at full effectiveness when they are actually in an encounter with all of the running around, target switching and other encounter mechanics that aren’t present when blasting away at a target dummy. One of the biggest differences we see between good guilds and best-in-the-world guilds is that the latter can maintain maximum DPS in almost any situation.<br />
<br />
The hope by implementing a glyph like this (and we aren’t sure we will, which is why we want feedback) is that your empirical DPS with the glyph may be higher than your theoretical DPS without it. Players who ignored the glyph might do lower DPS (because they are mortal and sometimes fumble with Inquisition) than if they just used the glyph.<br />
<br />
This is the kind of idea that, if it works, would be something we could do it for most classes and specs: trade off higher theoretical damage / tanking / healing for an easier rotation that might just mean higher effectiveness for some players.

people in the raid finder were getting that. if you wipe on deathwing in the raid encounter, you get &quot;stood in the fire&quot; and since he's so accessible in raid finder, that achievement really won't mean a thing.</div></div><hr />

Ya it was just Xelnath trolling, he spawned like 50 living metors in org first, then razed the city with DW fire for ~10 mins and moved everyone to the tauren area GY so you can't run back because you couldn't see anything but fire.</div></div><hr />

The only exception will be the xmute specialization which won't take that long assuming you farm Volatile Lives and xmute them accordingly, but that will take quite some time, bout 13-14 weeks, you'd be better off farming the volatiles, or just buying the Truegold, assuming you only have to turn in 4 Truegolds, not make them.</div></div><hr />

Part of that comes from what improved stats do for healers: they get bigger heals (from Intellect), the ability to cast more heals (larger mana pool), and the ability to cast those heals for a longer period of time without running out of mana (as a result of regen). Along the way, the tank and the group are take more damage from tougher bosses, but also have higher damage and higher survivability from improvements to their own gear. Please remember, the goal isn’t to make healers so resource-starved that they can’t heal. That isn’t fun. The goal is to reward healers who limit how much overhealing they do (in other words, play smarter) for their efforts. You limit your overhealing by doing things like casting a smaller heal when a smaller heal is sufficient, or casting a slower heal when death isn’t imminent, or casting a single-target heal when the group isn’t all taking damage at once. Skillful healers should prosper. When players feel like increasing their skill doesn’t increase their success, they tend to get bored or frustrated. <br />
<br />
Isn't the point of gearing up to be able to heal things more easily without breaking out into sweat? Or to survive trash/boss pulls without being dead within 2 seconds? Yes, it was very hard to heal cataclysm dungeons in ICC heroic gear and a few green/blue (quest) pieces along the way, but that's why you go into the dungeons, to eventually get the drops and get more survivability/dps/healing. Isn't content supposed to be hard when you just dinged? Otherwise it defeats the purpose. If you ding and you go immediately into a heroic of course it is hard to heal then. I don't quite get their point. Are they trying to say they want to make dungeons so easy again that people get bored already at lower level? Or harder for geared characters so that they're not so bored? To be honest, with having 7 characters at 85, I didn't have a problem healing dungeons anymore when I dinged 85. A) You can easily craft some 359 pieces or B) buy 353/359 boe's on the AH for not much money (depends on the server I guess, on mine they're cheap). I don't know, it doesn't matter what gear I'm having, I get bored of dungeons when I do them many, many times. And when I do them many, many times, I'd rather have smooth/quick runs than needing to concentrate all the time, especially in LFG pugs. If I want concentration, I go into raiding heroic modes. Also, do you just want us to stack Intellect and Spirit as much as we can? Cause we obviously still need Intellect for Spellpower, which is, compared to Spirit, giving us bigger heals still. I don't know, I'll see how it goes I guess, maybe they can make it so it's actually worthwhile. Reminds me a bit of Wotlk, having spellpower or spellpower/spirit gems with a rather small mana pool, and paladins having tons of mana since they stacked intellect. Good times. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for rewarding 'skilled healers' who don't overheal as much. I'm a druid and currently on 6/7 hc, and no matter what I do, no matter what gear I'm wearing even when I was in shit gear starting to do FL normal modes, I'm ALWAYS top on overhealing, rarely another healer doing as much, that's what hots do, you can't smart heal them when there are other healers involved. I put a Rejuvenation on a target, and another healer tops that person up in a matter of 2-3 seconds, so my heal still has a few ticks that just go to plain overhealing, not my fault that someone else healed them up. Or Wild Growth, I can't choose who to heal with it, it just goes to the 5-6 people whoever has the lowest health at that point. And yet again, with a few other healers in the group it's very likely that especially the 1-2 people that are at lowest health get quickly topped up, with WG yet again going to overheal. /shrug. Of course I can just use Nourish which heals for 10k with a 2 second cast, which is a rather lol-heal I only use when there's really no damage coming in or to refresh LB. Regrowth is a waste of mana and unless I want the haste buff, I don't cast it. Cause it also heals for almost nothing and costs way too much. Healing Touch is a nice heal, the biggest we have, also costs a bit of mana so you wanna think about it before casting it. Swiftmend is amazing, but yet again, can go to overhealing quickly if the people that happen to stand in it are basically at full health. Dunno, maybe it's just me but I'd find it hard not to overheal unless I'm solo healing as a druid. Not saying it isn't going to work, I do not know how the raids will look like in MoP and maybe they make it so there's always constant damage incoming, even if only small, so that hots just don't overheal, but I doubt it. Yet again, let's wait and see, but for the moment I'm skeptical. <br />
<br />
<br />
'When players feel like increasing their skill doesn’t increase their success, they tend to get bored or frustrated.' - If you play with 4-24 other people, success isn't always about you. Even if you play perfectly, if the others make many mistakes, you wipe, and still get frustrated. If you manage to not go oom, to keep people alive if they don't do silly stuff like standing in the fire, you don't get hit by stuff yourself and time your cooldowns at the most convenient times, I yet don't find it has much to do with overhealing but more about raid awareness. People die if you don't act fast enough, you die if you don't move fast enough, everyone dies if you use e.g. tranq too early and then don't have it for a healing intensive phase. Skill isn't only about who overheals the least, having played for a long time now, often the ones doing the least overhealing were the ones you could have not brought to the raid at all. Every class is different. Some classes are tend to overheal more than others, cause that's just a class mechanic that makes each healer unique.</div></div><hr />

I agree that Wrath healing was easy and Cataclysm healing seems fine, but they still fail on encounters most of the time. Damage that could once be healed by burst healing now kills the raid. Fights like Lord Rhoyolith are random enough on top of that if you happen to get stuck with 2 volcanos up, you can not heal &quot;smart&quot; but you have to pretty much spam shit around and pray that you have enough mana - especially if you're learning the encounter and when you hit p2 you're pretty much fucked so you spam AOE heals again. <br />
<br />
Bosses that have enormous AOE or reqire spamhealing:<br />
Beth'tilac p2, Lord Legs p1/p2, Alysrazor p2, Baleroc, Ragnaros - so 5 bosses in Firelands and that's just the last raid.<br />
<br />
Healing in general is fine, but boss dynamics are not. Most bosses are still on Wrath level in one of their phases concerning raid damage, while healing got castrated. And some classes are clearly more efficient at mana usage as others Paladin, Druid, Disc vs Holy Priest for example, which makes no sense what so ever.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, I'm pretty tired of changing the way I heal from expansion to expansion, wish they would find a good medium and leave it at that. New skills and talent changes are fine, but switching spells and efficiency around is kind of annoying. Went from +healing to spellpower only, then they removed that made intellect the sp stat, changed healing completely, when we hit max level, our spells felt like flicking bandages at players instead of healing and now with mists we will have to adjust to smaller mana pools and different spell costs again. I'm kind of tired of that.</div></div><hr />

They were only wipefests because people went in undergeared or gamed the system (with PVP gear/offspec gear in bags), and then treated it like Wrath easymode dungeons.<br />
<br />
They were never hard. They just required you not to be total dumbass and to have respect for the dungeon and use caution. People who actually learned and used tactics from pre-Wrath (like line of sight pulls, waiting for pats, and knowing what mobs to CC) didn't have wipefest problems. People who expected to charge in and pwn did. Funny how that works.</div></div><hr />

Yes. The recipes for that will be found in the new raid and not from trainers.

<br />
^^^ this. However, in patch 4.3 truegold is not needed for any of the new recipes, so in all likelyhood (if they don't change that in the last minute) truegold prices will skydive.<br />
Having said that, the new recipes/plans/patterns/designs whatever require a lot of fire &amp; water volatiles, so being able to transmute them 20% faster just is the way to go, especially as raids use battle cauldrons and in dungeons you're hard pressed to see anyone using a flask, let alone potion. Right now alchemy has 2 dead speccs and 1 which is a money machine. Not very hard to guess what people will do.</div></div><hr />

If you take away that really awesome goal of being able to heal X dungeon with ease once you're at Y gear level, there's very little incentive to face down 500+ attempts on your stupid Heroic bosses. The &quot;feel good&quot; feeling of seeing a boss dies only lasts so long.</div></div><hr />

Call me crazy but I've never found myself &quot;bored&quot; with healing. If anything I'm more frustrated with healing because every time I turn around our regen tools are getting hit HARD with the nerfbat. &quot;Oh hi, I'm a Druid healer and I used to have this really awesome spell called Innervate that would restore between 30-40% of my mana - and then for some reason this was bad...and now it barely restores 10% of my mana. I also used to love when a Shaman would drop a mana tide coz that was a GREAT help too, but not so much anymore.&quot; They've decided to remove all forms of replenish and now they want to make it more of a &quot;thought process&quot; to heal? Hoenstly, why not just give EVERY heal a 35sec SHARED cooldown and have each heal cost 1/3 of your entire mana pool so you have to be in a separate vent channel with the other healers trying to math out which healer will use which heal when their next c/d is up. The only thing I could possibly see this doing is putting a stop to healers that like to pad the charts, for all the good it never does. The balance is fine how it is - and if anyone is &quot;bored&quot; with healing then go play a different role and let those of us that enjoy being healers continue to enjoy it.</div></div><hr />

Theres a SW:ToR forum place here in MMO Champion. I suggest you go over there for your QQ over WoW rather than advertising your star wars game.<br />
P.S. The company made the game, not the players. They focus on what the players need in the game. Blizzard has other plans rather than listening to babies on forums that want housing and undead pallys.</div></div><hr />

I dont think you read the comment you quoted properly. The quote was:<br />

<br />
<br />
While we think the healer mana model for Cataclysm is sound and ultimately accomplished what we wanted, it was still a little too difficult for a on fresh level 85 just going into dungeons, and a little too easy for raiders.<br />
<br />
Now its clear that blizzard said it was too difficult for a fresh lvl85 to heal dungeons but too easy for raiders. Obviously at the beginning the difficulty should be the same when you go raiding as it is when you go in 5 mans. you gear up from loot you get in the raid.</div></div><hr />

Yup, Truegold on most realms might cost 1k for that much, especially high population servers.<br />

Still, unless they are going to fix the proc rates to be better and give cauldrons the ability to proc for flask mastery, maybe even introduce a cauldron for potions to be spec specific so that they can have a proc based cauldron for potion mastery.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;According to Wowhead, all of the existing BC alchemy mastery quests are staying in the game, so your future alchemist alts can breathe easy. That doesn't mean that existing alchemists won't see changes, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is either contrary to the front page, or omitted from the front page.<br />
<br />
<br />
Essentially the old quests are still game as of 4.3, but if you wish to switch specs, you have to do the new quest for the spec you wish to pick up.<br />
<br />
Either you;<br />
-go to your trainer and get the new quest<br />
-or you go to the old quest giver in outland and do the old quest.<br />
<br />
The 150g fee that is currently attached to switching specs is gone in 4.3, if you want to switch you have to do the associated quest from the trainer instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
-Current 525 transmute spec wants to change to elixir in 4.3 must do the quest for Elixir instead of paying 150 gold to respec<br />
-New alchemist wishes to pick up a spec in 4.3 can do the new quest from the trainer in any major city(which can be done at level 1 apparently) <br />
-or at the appropriate level (68 and 325 alchemy) you can do the old quest, but must go to the NPC in outland and get the quest.</div></div><hr />

Stop wasting time and energy on things that work fine for years its starting to get really tiresome. Just see the damage you done to raiding.<br />
<br />
I stopped healing in Cata in large part because I am tired of the radical changes to mechanics. And, for those still doing it, things are about to change yet again.<br />
<br />
Making healing &quot;fun&quot; ultimately means keeping people alive. Devs have run this &quot;make smart decisions&quot; line at us before, and the result is they are once again going back to the drawing board, sort of, trying to chase down the more fun boss. I mean, making spirit important again....wasn't I stacking spirit back in BC? <br />
<br />
You know what makes raiding fun guys? Creatively designed boss fights, good looking graphics, well-balanced classes, and an incentive to grow community. all this shifting of the basic way we play, rather than exciting and new, is actually pretty tedious. <br />
<br />
The game is down in paid subscriptions since this xpac went live by huge numbers (even for Blizz). You have pretty much killed off 25 person raiding. PvP is not much more than a side show for the vast majority of the population. <br />
<br />
So, before embarking on more new grand schemes to make playing &quot;more fun&quot; how about looking where you screwed the pooch and tweaking the stuff that really matters to us instead?<br />
<br />
btw, I've been on the same server in the same guild doing end game content for over five years. I want you to get it right.</div></div><hr />

I don't know... maybe because... it's Blizzard's game? Hard to hear as it might be, but you are, in effect, &quot;renting&quot; your ability to play WoW from Blizzard. <br />
<br />
And it's become painfully clear that &quot;doing what the players want&quot; doesn't always come out sunshine and butterflies, either. Look at the reception the Pandaren, one of the most asked for races in all of Warcraft, got. Look at how people QQed about transmogrification, a feature that has been asked for for a long, long time, claiming that it was just an excuse for &quot;blizzard not to have to make new gear&quot; or &quot;a poor excuse not to add new content.&quot; This claim that blizzard never does anything for the players is short-sighted, and, overall, completely untrue. Just because a feature that YOU didn't want (intellect changes, Pandaren, pet battle system, etc) is added doesn't mean NO ONE wanted.</div></div><hr />
