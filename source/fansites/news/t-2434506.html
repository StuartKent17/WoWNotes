Blizzard Responds to Azerite Armor Concerns<br />
Azerite - Worst Itemization in WoW's History<br />
You can't target the gear you want at all.<br />
There are 10 M+ dungeons, all of which drop ~10 different items per dungeon, and are all eligible to be looted from the cache (the only way to actually get the gear). This translates to a 1/100 chance to get the piece that you want, but that's only one piece. Then you've got to get 2 more pieces, each on separate 1/100 &quot;drop&quot; chance. Let's be lenient here and say we are given 6 months per content patch. This means that the probability of getting the items we want is actually orders of magnitude lower than the probability of getting the ideal legendary items in Legion.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of traits are useless and uninteresting.<br />
When all of our abilities were stripped away in 8.0, we were promised Azerite armor that would bring back the gameplay changes that artifacts brought. There are very few circumstances where this is the case, and most of the top-performing traits are just stat-padding, providing no progression or gameplay enhancements.<br />
<br />
When we get &quot;upgrades&quot; we have to re-farm the same traits that we have already farmed.<br />
We complained about having to farm traits on Legion Artifacts, and Blizzard's response was to give us only 1 or 2 traits, but to consistently lose them and have to re-farm them for the whole expansion. How is this an improvement?<br />
<br />
Every single gear change or upgrade requires simming.<br />
At no other point in WoW's history has simming been so required to find out if an item or trait is actually an upgrade. The proc rates, damage bonuses, or other interactions are so unintuitive that we have absolutely no idea what is an upgrade or not. At no other point in WoW's history has the casual player been at such a disadvantage for being uninformed.<br />
<br />
340 traits are out-performing 385 traits. Significantly.<br />
This is just embarassing, and should not be the case. How did this sort of imbalance between traits make it to live?<br />
<br />
The reforge cost re-introduces the exact spec-lock problem people had in Legion, but worse.<br />
Oh you want to PvP? Gotta reforge your Azerite! You want to PvE now? Reforge time! Oh, you need to tank this boss? Hearth and reforge your Azerite! People are getting their reforge costs into the thousands of gold, and it doesn't go down fast enough to allow us to reasonably perform multiple roles. How was this supposed to improve gameplay?<br />
<br />
The massive swings in power during &quot;tuning&quot; passes mean we have to hold onto all gear.<br />
We have no idea what is going to be our best trait next week, and what is best today may just be completely gutted tomorrow. Our only option as a player is hold onto every single piece of Azerite Armor and hope we have the right ones when Blizzard swings power in a different direction. Not only that, but when new traits are introduced to replace old traits, per Ion's comment, we are likely to encounter exactly the same issue.<br />
Few things I'd like to comment on here.<br />
<br />
First off, thanks for putting this thread together. Even if phrases like &quot;Worst Itemization in WoW's History&quot; are a bit hyperbolic (seriously, I can't be the only one who remembers farming level 30 dungeons for AQ40 resistance gear), you've summarized a lot of the discussions we've been seeing around the community very well. It really helps us clarify exactly what we need to be focusing on.<br />
<br />
I'll speak to each of your points as best as I can:<br />
<br />
Regarding targeting specific traits: I think we've said this a few times now, but just to reiterate, we believe that's merely a symptom of the imbalance between traits. Ideally, the gap between them isn't so large that you feel it would be hugely beneficial to grind out the perfect set.<br />
<br />
The point about traits being &quot;useless and uninteresting&quot; is interesting considering that you also make the point of &quot;every gear change requires simming.&quot; These two points are kind of at odds with each other. The way to solve the simming issue would be to make the traits more simplistic in nature. Similarly, making traits with more outside-the-box designs leads to more complicated questions of &quot;is this better or not,&quot; which in turn encourages more simming. Either way, it's an interesting challenge, and one we're taking to mind as we move forward with traits in future updates.<br />
<br />
I think we agree that re-farming traits doesn't feel great. I don't have a solve for that issue to share today, and to be completely transparent it may be something we simply have to accept as a downside to the system for other reasons. But we agree it can be a bit of a downer.<br />
<br />
I mentioned the imbalance between traits before, but just to expand on that: that's why we've focused so much effort into tuning Azerite traits over the past few weeks. With this most recent round of tuning, we think we've gotten most of the really egregious outliers dialed in, but please let us know if there are any you still feel are so good that they're worth huge sacrifices in terms of item level.<br />
<br />
As to the point about reforging costs: these costs get so high because we want the behavior you're describing -- reforging constantly depending on what you're doing -- to be unsustainable. Our intention is that you either build out multiple sets of gear for different situations, or you lean towards traits that work in a variety of roles (even if they're maybe not the absolute best for each in particular). We added the reforging system to help ease cases like, for example, a DPS who suddenly finds themselves needing to transition to being their guild's main tank, not as a means for constantly re-adjusting traits like a second set of talent points. Maybe the current system isn't achieving that, but if it isn't, we're likely to become MORE restrictive on reforging, not less.<br />
<br />
And finally, regarding the tuning passes: like I mentioned, we think we've got most of the major outliers dialed in to an acceptable level at this point. There's likely to still be some adjustments here and there, but we don't believe we're going to need another big wave of Azerite trait tuning like you've seen over the last few weeks. To put it another way: if one trait is far and away the best compared to every other option, sure, we should probably do something about that, but we don't expect that to take the form of a widespread tuning pass going forward.<br />
<br />
Also, to Ion's comment about new traits being introduced: he was referring to new traits on new gear added in new content, with higher item level, that replaces your old gear entirely. We're not planning to add in new traits to existing items, so don't worry about holding onto old Azerite pieces just in case their traits change.</div></div><hr />

We acknowledge that our complete inability to balance the azerite traits is killing the feature. <br />
Since the traits have different power levels, they must be useful and interesting, and live up to our promise that they would alter gameplay in fun ways.<br />
We agree that refarming traits is super not fun at all but we need to have you grinding as much as possible.<br />
We believe that tuning the traits to the point they should have been at before launch makes them useful and interesting.<br />
We intentionally made a high reforge cost to make you keep piece of azerite armor and need to farm every single one. Have fun with that.<br />
Because new traits will only be added to all new gear we think the forced grinding and hoarding is fine.<br />
<br />
This response legit makes me want to quit the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well what people assumed and what was communicated about the system was this:<br />
<br />
There would be traits for different situations and playstyles.<br />
<br />
Meaning some best suited for PvP, Mythic+ and Raids.<br />
<br />
The problem with this is that the cost of reforging the traits AND the fact that the gear isnt farmable means it directly contradicts that. Now instead of people looking for traits and armor for different situations it encourages you to only use the ones that work in all situations.<br />
<br />
A lot of the issues with Azerite traits could be resolved by allowing you to farm them in Mythic+</div></div><hr />

So I’m slightly confused about something. Why are people saying azerite gear isn’t farmable? As far as I know each piece has specific traits so I’m not seeing why you couldn’t just get multiple of the same piece or whatever and lock in diff traits? Am I missing something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the only way to get Azerite items in PvE above ilvl 340, is in the weekly m+ chest which picks a single item from every possible dungeon loot table, and from raids which reset weekly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
because once you want to go above 340 ilvl, you are dependant on your rng weekly caches to acquire the vast majority of traits - so not really farmable unless you consider crossing your fingers and toes every wednesday morning farming :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point of the system is to have equally strong traits that (supposedly) change your game play, pending on which trait you choose, for whatever play style you like to pursue.</div></div><hr />

This is possibly the worst argument i have ever heard, and the fact that it comes directly from blizzard themselves is the worst red flag. I mean this dude, this mentality is exactly why we have the problems we have ingame. I would bet u the dude writing here, talking to us, barely even plays wow. <br />
<br />
like legit. How does having to sim gear indicate any sort of gameplay complexity? when we fucking have 0 info about the effect, at all. How do we value an arbituary 500 haste vs 120 agility vs 1200 dmg on a X PPM? Simming is how we value it.<br />
How are the points of traits being passive number increases come at odds with traits being useless and uninteresting. <br />
How?<br />
Legit, how the fuck?</div></div><hr />

Oh ok I see. So azerite gear won’t drop from a completed M+ but it CAN drop from the weekly cache? I thought there was no azerite gear in M+ period, completed runs or weekly chest. Yeah, that is annoying.</div></div><hr />

Its not farmable because the entirety of m+ azerite gear is knly obtainable by a once a week rng roll</div></div><hr />

It really helps us clarify exactly what we need to be focusing on.<br />
<br />
The vanilla analogy makes the current system look even worse. In vanilla you knew what to farm and where to farm it. Simple. In BFA you can't even target items which is such a fundamental feature that it's making it clear, in my opinion, that BFA actually does have the worst itemization systems in WoW's history. Or are you saying that head, chest and shoulders should be as rare as legendaries were in Legion? That's the only system that comes close, and it was solved by the end of Legion; wakening essences. You have solved this exact problem before!<br />
<br />
Like, what even is the reasoning behind the scarcity above 340 item level? Is there some fucked up roleplaying aspect I´m missing here?<br />
<br />
Regarding targeting specific traits: I think we've said this a few times now, but just to reiterate, we believe that's merely a symptom of the imbalance between traits. Ideally, the gap between them isn't so large that you feel it would be hugely beneficial to grind out the perfect set.<br />
<br />
This goes against one of the core aspects of loot-driven RPG games; Actually getting sought after loot. If your solution to the issue of not being able to get desired items is to make them undesirable, then you are in fact missing the very essence of loot-driven games. You are also telling people how their subjective enjoyment of the game is wrong which is complete folly.<br />
<br />
The point about traits being &quot;useless and uninteresting&quot; is interesting considering that you also make the point of &quot;every gear change requires simming.&quot; These two points are kind of at odds with each other. The way to solve the simming issue would be to make the traits more simplistic in nature. Similarly, making traits with more outside-the-box designs leads to more complicated questions of &quot;is this better or not,&quot; which in turn encourages more simming. Either way, it's an interesting challenge, and one we're taking to mind as we move forward with traits in future updates.<br />
<br />
Jesus christ, no those points are not at odds with each other, and this is not even an answer to the core issue of actually being able to get the traits in the first place. A trait can be uninteresting and require simming at the same time. You accomplish this by 1) wording the tooltips so vaguely that players have no way of knowing what is going on and 2) you make all traits similar and passive with zero player input interaction. You have successfully achieved this with Azerite traits.<br />
<br />
I think we agree that re-farming traits doesn't feel great. I don't have a solve for that issue to share today, and to be completely transparent it may be something we simply have to accept as a downside to the system for other reasons. But we agree it can be a bit of a downer.<br />
<br />
Well now I feel much more secure in my trust in BFA, thanks :)<br />
<br />
Honestly though, throwing your hands up in the air saying &quot;deal with it, we don't believe we can fix it&quot; is possibly the worst response I have ever seen. It's far worse than not saying anything at all. YOU created this system, are you saying you don't know how to program a better system, or are you saying that the system is so heavily intertwined with other systems that no changes for the better can actually be made? I don't know which is worse.<br />
<br />
I mentioned the imbalance between traits before, but just to expand on that: that's why we've focused so much effort into tuning Azerite traits over the past few weeks. With this most recent round of tuning, we think we've gotten most of the really egregious outliers dialed in, but please let us know if there are any you still feel are so good that they're worth huge sacrifices in terms of item level.<br />
<br />
See above, the issue is not solely the balancing of the traits, it is also the acquisition of the gear with the traits in them as well as the traits themselves being boring and passive with zero interaction with what I, the player, actually does in the game. That aside, you're actually missing the mark with the balancing, so thats a triple failure.<br />
<br />
As to the point about reforging costs: these costs get so high because we want the behavior you're describing -- reforging constantly depending on what you're doing -- to be unsustainable. Our intention is that you either build out multiple sets of gear for different situations, or you lean towards traits that work in a variety of roles (even if they're maybe not the absolute best for each in particular). We added the reforging system to help ease cases like, for example, a DPS who suddenly finds themselves needing to transition to being their guild's main tank, not as a means for constantly re-adjusting traits like a second set of talent points. Maybe the current system isn't achieving that, but if it isn't, we're likely to become MORE restrictive on reforging, not less.<br />
<br />
Another contradictory system put in place here. Azerite traits are rare above 340 item level. There are also HUNDREDS of them in various combinations, so getting a trait is hard, and you might not be lucky and get the &quot;right&quot; trait for your playstyle. On top of that you add arbitrary restrictions to HINDER players from using that rare trait combination for more than one situation. The tank into dps into healer example is the go-to, but dps also have traits that work differently based on spec and talents and situation. Making it hard to adapt your gear to your character and gameplay, or as you do threaten to make it nigh impossible, is an arbitrary restriction on top of an uneccessarily cumbersome system. You worked for so long to get rid of these kinds of system, only to add them back. It is not FUN.<br />
<br />
Here's an interesting exercise. Change the word &quot;reforging&quot; to &quot;respec&quot; and &quot;traits&quot; to &quot;talents&quot; in the above paragraph, and see how well it would sit with Blizzard's current system of talents and respeccing.</div></div><hr />

As far as I know each piece has specific traits so I’m not seeing why you couldn’t just get multiple of the same piece or whatever and lock in diff traits? Am I missing something?<br />
<br />
bc ppl try to max out trails for dps reason when they shouldnt.<br />
So ppl that only do M+ cant upgrade thier Azorite gear outside the M droop. Something THAT BLIZZARD said was going to be a thing, to separate M+ from Raiding.<br />
<br />
So if you want to replace your azarite gear you need to raid or pvp.<br />
So ppl dont want that they just want to do M+<br />

Ppl complain allll the timeeeeee</div></div><hr />

Meanwhile, due to the assigned combinations of traits on armor pieces, the BiS drops for several specs are only found in the M+ weekly chest. Or, to be more accurate, only potentially -- but never actually -- found in the M+ weekly chest.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of raiders farming high keystones for potential upgrades to their raid loot, but after doing at least one +10, it's just a weekly lottery to see if you get anything useful for your efforts. Because M+ Azerite armor -- which, again, includes BiS pieces for several specs -- only has a single chance to drop a single piece per week from a loot table of over a hundred items, it's more likely than not that you will never see the piece you are looking for over the course of the entire expansion.<br />
<br />
And then the devs tell us that they want us to farm more Azerite sets if we want to play multiple roles.<br />
These two points are kind of at odds with each other.<br />
Indeed.</div></div><hr />

How does having to sim gear indicate any sort of gameplay complexity? when we fucking have 0 info about the effect, at all. How do we value an arbituary 500 haste vs 120 agility vs 1200 dmg on a X PPM? Simming is how we value it.<br />
How are the points of traits being passive number increases come at odds with traits being useless and uninteresting. <br />
How?<br />
Legit, how the fuck?<br />
<br />
Exactly this. That was a lot easier to manage back in MoP, when all proc chances were actually written down (i.e. 15% proc chance, 55sec iCD). Most of Azerite traits are like &quot;Your damaging spells have a chance to&quot;. A chance to. 5% ? 98 ? No iCD ? 20 minutes iCD ? No idea, simming is literally the only way to know if you should expect a 0.2% dps upgrade or a 20%.<br />
<br />
Plus, the fact trait stacking is absolutely not transparent (and you have to wander around the internet to know) entirely sucks. Why didn't they add something in-game, to clearly see what are the actual benefit of your items ?</div></div><hr />

agree with you abuot farming a 10+ for a chance on that BiS azorite gear.<br />
But you dont need any of that to do the current content that is out there. <br />
Not bc your have your BiS trail your dps will go up crazy vs a 375 droop from Heroic raiding with not BiS traits<br />
<br />
<br />
That is just a metality that blizzard is trying to remove from player, and i hope they stay with this new system. Allow you to just dont go crazy over gear like past expansions</div></div><hr />

Azerite - Worst Itemization in WoW's History<br />
<br />
Few things I'd like to comment on here.<br />
<br />
First off, thanks for putting this thread together. Even if phrases like &quot;Worst Itemization in WoW's History&quot; are a bit hyperbolic (seriously, I can't be the only one who remembers farming level 30 dungeons for AQ40 resistance gear), you've summarized a lot of the discussions we've been seeing around the community very well. It really helps us clarify exactly what we need to be focusing on. <br />
<br />
I remember having to farm for the mats for the Frozen Shadoweave set back in BC....that was a CRAFTED SET with materials I had to FARM to TARGET the gear I wanted. I also remember having to farm shadow resist gear and fire resist gear for Tempest Keep - again, I KNEW where the gear was that I needed. This is the most bullshit way to start this wall of text of a response.<br />
<br />
I'll speak to each of your points as best as I can:<br />
<br />
Regarding targeting specific traits: I think we've said this a few times now, but just to reiterate, we believe that's merely a symptom of the imbalance between traits. Ideally, the gap between them isn't so large that you feel it would be hugely beneficial to grind out the perfect set. <br />
<br />
What the fuck even is he trying to say here? Does blizz not realize certain classes value certain stats over others and we are targeting them because our rotation(s) feel like dogshit due to the lack of secondary stats (thanks again for not putting any on azerite gear). Like, I have to stack 3 different types of haste procs just to create a semblance of casting smoothness. It's egregious I have to keep swapping gear around to make sure I have one or two decent haste procs just to make my rotation feel normal. That's not fun or interesting or anything, that's fucking broken.<br />
<br />
The point about traits being &quot;useless and uninteresting&quot; is interesting considering that you also make the point of &quot;every gear change requires simming.&quot; These two points are kind of at odds with each other. The way to solve the simming issue would be to make the traits more simplistic in nature. Similarly, making traits with more outside-the-box designs leads to more complicated questions of &quot;is this better or not,&quot; which in turn encourages more simming. Either way, it's an interesting challenge, and one we're taking to mind as we move forward with traits in future updates.<br />
<br />
Even if you made traits simplistic such as &quot;this grants 538 haste for 12 seconds when you cast spell and effects&quot; and &quot;this grants 323 mastery, 323 crit and 323 haste for 18 seconds&quot; people would STILL SIM THEM. These two points are not &quot;at odds with each other&quot; and in fact they are mutually exclusive. Irregardless of the gear people will sim, that cannot be changed. What can be changed are the variances and effects of our gear. I would like to be able to maintain other abilities (class baseline ones) with the azerite traits for some serious synergy. Allow some traits to interact with the core abilities of classes to make the rotations and abilities feel INTERESTING. While I like the flat haste and mastery buffs, I like things that change the rotation. As a Destruction lock I actually like 'Bursting Flare' as it changes the rotation up but to maintain it and ensure it stays up is a pain vs other traits, not to mention the buff isn't as good as other passive ones. I want to use them but the other passive options are clear winners. These traits are not fun (oh and the ones that are get nerfed rather than buffing other ones, gg)<br />
<br />
I think we agree that re-farming traits doesn't feel great. I don't have a solve for that issue to share today, and to be completely transparent it may be something we simply have to accept as a downside to the system for other reasons. But we agree it can be a bit of a downer. <br />
<br />
lol<br />
<br />
I mentioned the imbalance between traits before, but just to expand on that: that's why we've focused so much effort into tuning Azerite traits over the past few weeks. With this most recent round of tuning, we think we've gotten most of the really egregious outliers dialed in, but please let us know if there are any you still feel are so good that they're worth huge sacrifices in terms of item level. <br />
<br />
They have &quot;tuned&quot; traits that were already garbage. I have 0 reason to use Flashpoint - mobs above 80% health are non existent as higher gear levels are achieved. It should be &gt; 80 and &lt; 30 to balance it out. As I mentioned, Bursting Flare for Destruction locks can be fun but managing it vs others is a no brainer. Accelerent seems cool and in theory it works nicely to boost the AoE for Destruction buuuuut when there are not 3 adds it leaves a lot to be desired (this is not going to turn into a Rain of Fire bashing as that spell needs a massive rework). The tuning they did were on garbage traits, they need to bring traits more in line and buff the proc rate / chance and maintenance for a whole lot of azerite traits.<br />
<br />
As to the point about reforging costs: these costs get so high because we want the behavior you're describing -- reforging constantly depending on what you're doing -- to be unsustainable. Our intention is that you either build out multiple sets of gear for different situations, or you lean towards traits that work in a variety of roles (even if they're maybe not the absolute best for each in particular). We added the reforging system to help ease cases like, for example, a DPS who suddenly finds themselves needing to transition to being their guild's main tank, not as a means for constantly re-adjusting traits like a second set of talent points. Maybe the current system isn't achieving that, but if it isn't, we're likely to become MORE restrictive on reforging, not less. <br />
<br />
I mean, I guess kudos for standing your ground but this flies in the face of OBTAINING THE GEAR WITH THE RIGHT TRAITS that was mentioned at the start of this excuse of a response. Like, ok, sure let's get the pieces we need with the traits we want so we don't have to reforge oh wait I just realized the piece I need is above 340 and therefore I have to wait for RNG upon RNG upon RNG to get what I want - GREAT IDEA.<br />
<br />
And finally, regarding the tuning passes: like I mentioned, we think we've got most of the major outliers dialed in to an acceptable level at this point. There's likely to still be some adjustments here and there, but we don't believe we're going to need another big wave of Azerite trait tuning like you've seen over the last few weeks. To put it another way: if one trait is far and away the best compared to every other option, sure, we should probably do something about that, but we don't expect that to take the form of a widespread tuning pass going forward. <br />
<br />
They are so tone deaf to the issues that the playerbase is suffering from. Tuning a trait here or there is not what certain classes need. Touting the azerite gear as a replacement for legendaries, tier and artifact weapons was far too ambitious and ludicrous. Someone should have told them to pump the breaks on that idea because it has sunk like a stone. These traits do not make the rotations interesting nor do they enhance the gameplay. All they do for me is long for a time when I had a balanced class and stats that I could manage myself and be happy with that. Now in between procs of &quot;Overwhelming Power&quot; and &quot;Blood Rite&quot; and &quot;Elemental Whirl&quot; I am just crossing my fingers and hoping that the proc will happen again otherwise it's just stagnant and sluggish.<br />
<br />
Also, to Ion's comment about new traits being introduced: he was referring to new traits on new gear added in new content, with higher item level, that replaces your old gear entirely. We're not planning to add in new traits to existing items, so don't worry about holding onto old Azerite pieces just in case their traits change.<br />
<br />
Oh, that's great. That doesn't solve the issue of me having 9 chest pieces, 7 headpieces and 3 shoulders though at the moment, does it? <br />
<br />
I swear this whole response was a giant middle finger to the players. blizzard has no fucking clue what they are doing and they are bringing us down with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While i loved Classic, and i certainly wouldn't go back to that, it is true AT LEAST i could aim for an item and farm it. And after that, there's been many iterations of that system and improvements working perfectly. Til WoD. Now i don't even know. Roll the dice and pray RNGesus. So much bullshit going on and they still act like entitled gods with all knwoledge. It's like re-living Diablo 3 bullshit storm.<br />

Fix all this nosense and focus again on the main aspect of the game, HAVING FUN. Please. I agree there needs to be a good amount of grinding, it's an MMORPG game, but they made everything so dull, boring and job-like nowadays, from leveling to farming gear, it is digusting.</div></div><hr />

why you have 9 chest 7 head and 3 shouelders????<br />

<br />
Even if Blizz internally feels like their Azerite system is flawless and a gift from the gods, if their customer base is loudly and forcefully voicing legitimate concerns, then it means they should be making changes (within reason) to keep their customers happy. Having to constantly farm AP to regain the same (or sometimes worse) traits you already had just because you got a new piece of gear that is technically an upgrade is a very unfulfilling game play mechanic, and it needs to be addressed ASAP.<br />
<br />
But even more importantly, Blizz really needs to work on their tone when dealing with an unhappy player base. I really don't understand why defending Azerite Power/traits/gear is the hill Blizz has decided to die on, but they are really throwing good money after bad trying to make us all think it is a great system and everything is fine.<br />
<br />

If you raided regularly and completed the available content, you had a very good chance of getting what you were after. Not necessarily a socketed titanforge, but at least the item itself you were hoping for. Loot tokens made it even more likely.<br />
<br />
Putting a lot of the best gear on a massive loot table with one chance per week to reach into a chest and pull one out at random ... no, that's not &quot;just like wow has been forever.&quot; Oh, I have had some really unlucky RNG spells in WoW before, but this is worse RNG than early-Legion legendary drop mechanics, and you can also get duplicates.<br />

This is what i don't understand. Ghostcrawler maybe took many bad decissions, but it wasn't on this level of bullshit. Like, i don't know, Diablo 3 was a major flop by almost everyone i know, and it lost it's population kinda fast because how repetitive and RNG revolved it was, consensus was &quot;keep the new cool stuff but go back and recover it's old soul&quot;. But nope. They got every digsuting trait from that game and slapped on a perfectly working game because it requires less effort that way. Sad times indeed.</div></div><hr />

So ppl that only do M+ cant upgrade thier Azorite gear outside the M droop. Something THAT BLIZZARD said was going to be a thing, to separate M+ from Raiding.<br />

You don't even bother responding with a legitimate counter argument. Your response is some half ass post with tons of obvious / intentional typos when the original poster clearly spent a good amount of time giving well thought out critiques of the game. Why do you even bother posting? You clearly don't play the game in the same way as others and that is fine. But I would bet my account that you aren't a serious end game player otherwise you would agree with the points being made in the original post. You aren't affected by the issues because you don't even play the game enough to understand the frustrating feeling of sitting on a multiple 340 ilvl azerite pieces for nearly a month now because you weren't lucky enough to get Azerite from your weekly M+ cache OR get a low drop chance of receiving a raid piece of azerite. I've cleared 8/8n and Heroic since week one and i'm still using 2 340 Azerite items.<br />

Like really dont know what to said you, you just overcomplicate your game, bc no reason. <br />
<br />
Like you complain right now bc you want to maybe win blizzard if they nerf or buff something, while everything will become irrelevant as soon as the new raid come out and the item level go up.<br />
<br />
That why i like the new system prevent stupid punish stupid behivior like this<br />
<br />
I see that youre constantly trying to tell people What they should be doing in game. How about making a system that makes it possible to play your character to its full potential in any given situation? Is that such a bad thing? If Im in a group where we need a lot of aoe because the other people bring single target, or vice versa, i want to be able to bring that to the table, but i cant do that to its full potential because the gear required is not available to get in a reasonable or deterministic way. Meanwhile another player can because they got lucky. That is not a fun system. <br />
<br />
I have saved every single 340+ azerite piece since the first tuning pass because god knows What theyll do next week</div></div><hr />

first dude, im a end game player, currently working on mythic with my guild, and working on getting Rival rank doing Rbgs.<br />

The issue is that i make the best of what i got and im not go complaing to every single change blizzard do. <br />

So you admit that theres an issue. The same issue we are saying is being handled poorly. Youre just choosing to go with it. That doesnt solve the issue.<br />
<br />
I Dont think Anyone is saying its literally impossible to do the things we want in game, like raiding or pvp or m+. The issue is that we could do it better if we got lucky. That is a gnawing feeling of disatisfaction for people like me who like to be the best they can be. We want to change that to work so that we could do better if we worked towards a deterministic goal of getting x items with y traits, but it is impossible right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it is really that horrible that you have 2 340 ilvl pieces after 5 weeks? You can actually upgrade them to 345 for one and you will eventually get those 370s or even 385s. Why does it have to be immediate always? Think back a couple of expansions, you had to farm some raids for months before your BIS actually dropped and then everyone wanted it and you had to be either very active or very good or both to actually get it.<br />
<br />
Yes, Blizzard has gone faaaar overboard with the &quot;Everyone can get Everything whenever they want it&quot; philosophy, but that's actually very bad for an MMO. Because let's face it: If gear is your goal, then you won't have any incentive to continue playing if you get everything the first hc ID you play. If your goal is challenge, then not having the absolute BIS the very first week is actually working in your favor because it makes things just a tiny bit more challenging. Not impossibly so, but a bit more.<br />
<br />
And to be fair, especially after the latest round of azerite tunings, there is literally not that much difference between the traits any more. So even if you don't get the one that sims like 50 dps higher, you still will be able to do competitive damage.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crimsonhead</div><div class="date">2018-09-27, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">why you have 9 chest 7 head and 3 shouelders????<br />
what situation demand that you have that many options????<br />
<br />
If you are hybrid class you have 3 combinations, and maybe one for pvp if you are a hight end ranking player. <br />
<br />
<br />
So plz im really interesting to know why you have 9 chest<br />
<br />
Fair question, I will try to provide the best answer. <br />
<br />
As a destruction lock my choices are already limited as to what is &quot;good&quot; - I need haste and mastery and crit has started to falloff severely as a desired stat. As such, I have multiple chest pieces that have combinations of each (mastery / haste) but in different amounts with different T2 traits meant for AoE and single target. Some chest pieces are duplicates of others but have alternating traits and some chest pieces are for other specs. I may not be exactly 9, but it's more than 6. <br />
<br />
Sadly none of the chest pieces are 355 (I have 370 shoulders which I have to drop to 340 sometimes for better traits, the 355 ones are for another spec) and my helm at 355 is OK but has to also be moved around to 340 for optimal haste traits.) I am seeking things like &quot;Overwhelming Power&quot;, &quot;Blood Rite&quot;, &quot;Meticulous Scheming&quot; and that one that procs mastery. I am constantly rotating gear and making new sets to see what works and what doesn't, I haven't gotten rid of anything for fear tomorrow it may be buffed to be BiS as everything is garbage (or pretty close to it) right now.</div></div><hr />

Not impossible, just improbable :)<br />
<br />
And then again, isn't that very similar to titanforging / overpowered sockets? Equally improbable that you get everything ilvl 400 with socket, but that would probably give you an even bigger boost to become the &quot;best you can be&quot;, no?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes its roughly the same issue, but at the same time its not. If youre going for 400 w socket in every slot, you can actively target farm that by doing the specific content/boss that drops that piece of gear, one at a time until you have them all. A tangible goal, albeit not very likely to ever be achieved. However there is no equivalent option for azerite gear, which is the issue that needs solving. Even if the drop chance was 1% it Would be better than the current system as you could target it and obtain it with some sense of a deterministic approach.</div></div><hr />

Comparing farming resistence items for one boss in AQ40 to getting a shitty upgrade with wrong traits. OOoookay.<br />
<br />
Is this guy high or smth? What's up with the side-stepping and weird analogies?<br />
Traits can't be balanced when they fill different roles. I never had AoE, ST or whatever role these traits fill. Those roles were defined by specialization.<br />
Why is the game so damn overdesigned now. Every system has to be this grand overarching thing. It's so fucking boring. Turns out lawyers are good with spreadsheets but not with fun game design.<br />
<br />
I'm so pumped when classic comes out again. It's like a testament for veterans to show WoW wasn't always such a boring streamlined game about rng items. Maybe it'll be hated, either way, I'm so excited for the reactions.<br />
<br />
Legion was better than WoD just because of sheer content and that the game was cranked up so much to crazy levels. Farmable dungeon items that are better than raid? Are you kidding me?? Made most things irrelevant and now the trick doesn't seem to work twice and people get bored and more demanding but unlike Legion there's not enough filler content to keep people happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is 1 trait that is good for raiding as resto shaman. So I just stack that one and ignore everything else. And 1 trait good for mythic +. Everything else is just fluff I don't really need.<br />
<br />
Between my specc specific traits and the other ones there is no choice. A trait that increases my main spell wins everything over a trait that gives me a procc that I do not even want. <br />
<br />
Next traits in line for my gear is a trait that increases my speed by a microscopical amount when something dies. It goes not give me any will to get azerite at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow has always been a mix of those 3. Vanilla having a good balance of those 3, Later in vanilla they introduced the tier tokens, which reduced rng slightly, and grinding by a lot. Setting the main focus of progression on how hard content you defeat, thus better is your character progression.<br />
<br />
From tbc they further reduced rng, by adding badges and very powerfull crafted items, but greatly increased the grinding needed. But you could target a spesific item that you wanted to work against.<br />
<br />
Wotlk reduced both grinding and the focus on defeating hardest content, since tier items dropped in 10man. Setting the game into a good balance with the 3 factors in progression.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm kept the progression balance, although they increased the difficulty on the lowest difficulty compared to wotlk, and removed much of the character progression you could do outside of raids and dungeons, making it hard for less experienced players that wotlk catered to, to have any character progression. The LFD system is not a good tool for difficult content. Blizzard was forced to tune it down, and introduced LFR as a bandaid fix for less experienced players to progress, but at the cost of progression that made the player feel like they were contributing.<br />
<br />
Mop increased the out of raid/ dungeon grinding a lot, too much id say. But kept the progression balance decent enough. Until siege of Orgrimmar, where warforging first was introduced, increasing RNG factor of character progression.<br />
<br />
Then came WoD, that reduced grinding out of raid, but massively increased RNG by keeping warforging, but set a much higher focus on defeating hard content.<br />
<br />
Legion further increased RNG, but added mythic+ to give out of raid grinding and a focus on hard content. But RNG became a much stronger factor since you could titanforge and warforge, making it a RNG grindfest.<br />
<br />
BFA added more RNG factors with forced personal loot and azerite traits, to the point that it is the most dominant factor of them all. Since you can titanforge gear to be equal to the hardest content, thus removing the need to do the hardest content, as long as you grind enough and have RNG gods on your side.<br />
<br />
Out of the 3 progression factors, RNG is the least fun and meaningfull way to progress your character, but when you add grinding as the second most dominant factor. Its just not fun. Since your hard work aint guaranteed to give results, just increasing your chances.</div></div><hr />

Doing old content for an increase in power isn't inherently bad anyway. If done correctly it could even be fun. Destiny has done this with Black Spindle and Whisper.

We acknowledge that our complete inability to balance the azerite traits is killing the feature. <br />
Since the traits have different power levels, they must be useful and interesting, and live up to our promise that they would alter gameplay in fun ways.<br />
We agree that refarming traits is super not fun at all but we need to have you grinding as much as possible.<br />
We believe that tuning the traits to the point they should have been at before launch makes them useful and interesting.<br />
We intentionally made a high reforge cost to make you keep piece of azerite armor and need to farm every single one. Have fun with that.<br />
Because new traits will only be added to all new gear we think the forced grinding and hoarding is fine.<br />

Our intention is that you either build out multiple sets of gear for different situations, or you lean towards traits that work in a variety of roles (even if they're maybe not the absolute best for each in particular). We added the reforging system to help ease cases like, for example, a DPS who suddenly finds themselves needing to transition to being their guild's main tank, not as a means for constantly re-adjusting traits like a second set of talent points. Maybe the current system isn't achieving that, but if it isn't, we're likely to become MORE restrictive on reforging, not less.<br />

This is the dumbest shit I've heard from Blizzard in a LONG time. I play MT for my guild, but I also do pvp as arms, and swap between dps and tank as needed for high end M+. Blizzard I PLAY YOUR GAME, why the fk are you making it impossible to do that?</div></div><hr />

Mythic guilds are able to kill the bosses, yes, that doesn’t make the system good. Especially not when mythic players complain about the system and keep trying to offer suggestions. The game is balanced around the system so obviously it will be achievable. <br />
<br />
Your own attitude is just as toxic as people who ask for hand-outs. You just assume that any criticism isn’t legitimate and comes from bad players because mythic guilds reluctantly put-up with the system. You are just as out of touch as anyone asking for the whole thing to be removed.</div></div><hr />

Wish they had the balls to do that on all of their decisions, instead of the usual backpedaling they play, like the little snowflakes they usually are.<br />

blizzard has always been incredibly stubborn about their decisions to a fault, what are you talking about.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The point about traits being &quot;useless and uninteresting&quot; is interesting considering that you also make the point of &quot;every gear change requires simming.&quot; These two points are kind of at odds with each other.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
also this is hilarious<br />
<br />
so because the item has a convoluted tooltip like &quot;this does x damage sometimes&quot; and that dmg value isnt even the actual value adn we have no idea of the procrate, that somehow makes it interesting<br />

So basically the same as (better than, in fact) tier sets used to be?<br />
<br />
I don't particularly like the Azerite system, but this seems like an asinine complaint to me. If it were farmable in M+, people would instead say they're &quot;forced&quot; to run (insert dungeon with best simming trait here) forevermore.</div></div><hr />

You could have also just bought/crafted it like my guild did back then, not to mention it was only used for a few bosses anyway (for content that was completed by probably less than 10% of the players).

We acknowledge that our complete inability to balance the azerite traits is killing the feature. <br />
Since the traits have different power levels, they must be useful and interesting, and live up to our promise that they would alter gameplay in fun ways.<br />
We agree that refarming traits is super not fun at all but we need to have you grinding as much as possible.<br />
We believe that tuning the traits to the point they should have been at before launch makes them useful and interesting.<br />
We intentionally made a high reforge cost to make you keep piece of azerite armor and need to farm every single one. Have fun with that.<br />
Because new traits will only be added to all new gear we think the forced grinding and hoarding is fine.<br />

That might not be the case if they actually tried to balance the traits and not make some of them 4 to 5 times stronger(or weaker) than most others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's part of why I don't really like the system myself, as well. But let us not kid ourselves, the same people would feel forced to run dungeons ad nauseum even if the best trait was a 5% upgrade over the second best instead of a 30% one or whatever it is. To say nothing of the fact that best simming traits aren't always the best in practice, trait stacking and ST vs AoE (among other things) can vary things up considerably, and as such fanatically farming a trait because Bloodmallet says it is the best is missing the forest for the trees I think, for a good amount of specs at least.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, it reads almost exactly like the destiny 2 team making excuses for nerfing this that or the other in favor of balance. Never put balance ahead of fun. <br />
<br />
Azerite gear commits the worst sin in gaming... it’s boring. Hunting tier, legendaries, or even pet farming are more fun than azerite gear. <br />
<br />
They really should just bite the bullet, admit it’s not working, and redesign it for 8.2</div></div><hr />

<br />
&gt;Worst itemization? Oh look at shit we had 15 years ago! That was worse! Don't complain! It could be worse!<br />
<br />
&gt;We want all traits to be basically the same in effect in all situations and we believe that is good.<br />
<br />
&gt;How is azerite boring if it needs to be simmed?? (Seriously logic isn't Blizzard employee's strongest trait.) <br />
Gear requires simming because it's all passive gains with no way to personally track their impact as a casual player without proper addons and ton of time so people sim it. If the azerite trait was having some impact on the gameplay then people could choose whatever suits them, i.e. AoE vs ST; highly rewarding but also highly punishing vs moderate reward and low punishment for poor execution etc.<br />
<br />
&gt;Oh yea we fucked it up with re-farming but guess you have to suck it up and wait for a properly prepared and finished expansion that wasn't rushed and totally flaked on the way to launch.<br />
Reforging is actually a matter of discussion with no easy way out, that I can agree.<br />
<br />
<br />
Technically Blizzard just admitted that they utterly failed with Azerite armor and they are going to just even out the traits so that they don't really matter and you just mindlessly equip the gear with higher item levels because there is even no point in trying to fix them in some smart way (on that I agree, can't scrap them so just make them irrelevant). They also basically told us to suck it up.<br />

<br />
pretty much, nioh was a recent success of a mix between the diablo loot spray meets RPG reforging.<br />
with the addition of the abyss you can straight upgrade starting greys to legendary quality by corrupting them then running at least 3 continuous levels in the abyss.<br />
the reforging allowed you to randomly reforge a trait but a material obtained by daily twilight missions and doing co'op with low-levels where the rewards are tailored to your current equipment with the aim being of giving you upgrades or at least useful materials for upgrading your current equipment more efficiently.</div></div><hr />

Except for my Azerite pieces, which are inexplicably still 20-35 ilvls lower because of shitty loot systems.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I recently received a 385 Chest that did negative HPS if I actually tried to benefit from its trait. I disagree that the traits are balanced.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not really inexplicably. they are lower because they are rarer. To me that is not necessarily an issue.<br />
<br />
If there really is a trait like this (though I believe there is a lot of hyperbole in there), then it is a bug and you should raise it to the devs. I don't know how it works for heal traits as I don't have a healer, but for locks at least, there are some that seem a dps loss at first, but then if you adjust your gameplay to it, they are actually one of the best traits out there. Maybe that's the case for the heal ones as well? As I said, don't know just a hypothesis.<br />
<br />
Overall, I don't see an issue wearing a 340 or 2 despite everything else being 370. On the contrary, my point would be that the 370s / 385s are too common. Maybe I'm playing the game for too long, but that was one of the really cool things back in Vanilla and TBC that you actually had to work several months to get your equip, not several weeks or even days like now.</div></div><hr />

We added the reforging system to help ease cases like, for example, a DPS who suddenly finds themselves needing to transition to being their guild's main tank, not as a means for constantly re-adjusting traits like a second set of talent points. Maybe the current system isn't achieving that, but if it isn't, we're likely to become MORE restrictive on reforging, not less.<br />

<br />
<br />
First: The reason we may have to &quot;accept as a downside&quot; is because by the time they could come up with a good fix, the problem will no longer be present, as the &quot;catch up mechanism&quot; is allowing us to gain AP much faster every week, so 3-4 weeks from now, everyone will have the first two or three traits unlocked on every piece of azerite gear in the game, and it won't even be as much of an issue for new players, since their AP gain will be ludicrously fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second: I agree that there is an issue with Azerite's Rarity and the M+ cache issue, and Lore didn't specify anything further about that, but their stance on this is that they want us to have gear for specific specs, and that's not a bad thing inherently, especially when you only have to swap out a few pieces. I liken this to the Legendary system from Legion, I had 2 legendaries equipped and was forced to carry alternate sets of legendaries for use in other specs. The difference here is that Azerite Pieces do have traits that can be used by any spec, and that are more universal. So it's actually a slightly better system.</div></div><hr />

Next expansion we will give the playerbase what they want.... epic rotations, gcd gone for most spells, fun content, flying immediately after getting pathfinder 1, cutting down WQs to 2 a day, etc etc&quot;<br />
<br />
Imagine if they said this? I'd pay for a year's subscription if they said this.<br />
<br />
Will never happen, they'd all be fired if they did. No corporation will allow it's workers to admit their product is fatally flawed when it's still being sold. Imagine if in the 70's, Ford had advertised &quot;We admit our Pintos explode when you backend them, but we'll get it right next time - but go buy a Pinto!&quot; <br />
<br />
The only time they will admit they failed is when 9.0 drops. That's how they've treated it in the past. Right around when 9.0 drops, Ion will make one of his scripted &quot;We need to do better&quot; Q&amp;As - and the cycle will repeat.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc59b5827c7e</div><div class="date">2018-09-27, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First: The reason we may have to &quot;accept as a downside&quot; is because by the time they could come up with a good fix, the problem will no longer be present, as the &quot;catch up mechanism&quot; is allowing us to gain AP much faster every week, so 3-4 weeks from now, everyone will have the first two or three traits unlocked on every piece of azerite gear in the game, and it won't even be as much of an issue for new players, since their AP gain will be ludicrously fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second: I agree that there is an issue with Azerite's Rarity and the M+ cache issue, and Lore didn't specify anything further about that, but their stance on this is that they want us to have gear for specific specs, and that's not a bad thing inherently, especially when you only have to swap out a few pieces. I liken this to the Legendary system from Legion, I had 2 legendaries equipped and was forced to carry alternate sets of legendaries for use in other specs. The difference here is that Azerite Pieces do have traits that can be used by any spec, and that are more universal. So it's actually a slightly better system.<br />
<br />
I hope you realise that new Azerite gear will require even higher neck levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not them forgetting, this is their new stance after spending several days sitting around the office &quot;discussing&quot; the issue, talking to the devs who made this hot garbage, don't have the talent/ideas to fix it, so this is the new stance - &quot;we want you to not care about the number one selling point and path of progression for the entire expansion. We might fix it later, but we have &quot;discussions&quot; to do, yammering endlessly that doesn't get us anywhere, and hopefully you'll just get used to this shit on a pretty platter we sold you.&quot;<br />
<br />
WoW needs new management and leadership. Period. I hate to go there, but it's true. Maybe not firing, but moving whoever is making these decisions to a different team. They burned up what dregs of respect and faith left long before this, and I have zero faith they can design their way out of this. Again, not even mad at Lore, but I suspect he may be one of the first real victims here, because he's got a big red target on his back anyway, and it's now 10 miles high in blinking neon defending this trainwreck.<br />
<br />
Morhaime needs to step in on this, soon. At the latest, opening Blizzcon with an apology, introducing the new Game Director and Producer, and talking about the path forward. It's that bad. They have to sell this awful nonsense for two more years - this could literally drop subs to the point they can't justify a budget - or force massive budget cuts, making the game even worse. Lore is just telling us what Ion's attitude is, and it's clear, Ion doesn't give a wet fart for what players want, and doesn't going forward. He's trying to retrain and micromanage the players to some vague &quot;grand scheme&quot; he won't reveal, because the whole secrecy issue with gaming is getting out of hand. They're going to double and triple down on stupidity for ego, and it's going to require a boxcar of popcorn until Morhaime fixes whatever is wrong over there in Irvine.<br />
<br />
Unless they're revealing a new franchise or game that will replace WOW sub money at Blizzcon, they have a serious issue with their bread and butter money maker here.</div></div><hr />

No, you can't. But apparantly you remember this 20 minute farming session as some kind of grand problem with the loot system. A 20 minute farm (you can just spam farm it like you would boosting low levels) that affected less than 1% of the playerbase. Possibly even fractions of a percent. Makes it sound like the person stating this has no idea what they're talking about. Not saying that's the case, but that's certainly how I perceive it. Do not compare flaws in nearly every single piece of Azerite gear this Expansion to this tiny niche that was solved with 20 min of farming, which I might add sounds more fun and RPG centric than what we have now. I'd welcome that system again with open arms, Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

If MMO-champs has had 500k users across its entire history I would be surprised.

The thing is, MMOs are a money pie, and every other company wants a part of that pie. Besides mobile games, MMOs are the most profitable game gender, this way of thinking is basically what brought the gender to it's knees and made it merely the ghost of what it was. It is what brought trash games that had only the goal of milking the cow until death such as Neverwinter, ArcheAge, BDO, ESO and a lot of others.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the prospect of having full-VR MMOs is terrifying to me. MMOs are already buried under tons of QOL improvements and cosmetic options hidden behind a paywall, Jesus Christ, what will it be in full-VR ?<br />

blizzard will never ever take into concern what the player base say, do or want ...<br />
blizzard does what ever they want to do ....<br />
<br />
a short example :<br />
noone so far mentioned the increase of dismounting, slowing from low lvl mobs to max out lvl players .....or even the fact that mob increasement at places where u have to make a WQ or kill a quest mob, by 250% compared to other expansions.noone mentioned so far that wow turned into a korean farming game and became a lineage 2 clone ( compare mats for pots and flask for example since WOTLK untill now ) increase of arround 300%...<br />
when blizzard want, that players need 1 hour to go the way to a quest mob, by killing 100 other mobs they fill find a way to make that happen.<br />
just take a look at suramar, court of stars as example ...<br />
<br />
the only way blizzard will EVER listen to the players, and start to truly communicate with them. even outside the USA ( we all know that blizazrd ONLY act,react to the US forum, and players ) is if the whole player base will not play wow for arround 1 month ......this 1 month without players will make blizzard listen and hear what we say .....<br />
people are demonstration for all shit arround the world.. why it should not be possible online for a game than ? <br />
when blizzard dosent have players for 1 month, they will know something went realy wrong, and they pissed of the players ...<br />
<br />
90% of the player base is not happy on the how wow turned out since legion, and the crapp blittard is always bringing to the game....<br />
the only good thing so far was reforging at cataclysm .. but blizzard removed it.....<br />
<br />
that in the last 3 months blizzard is forced to explain almost every single day something, to defend themself, and always says it different should make the players at last start to realize that something is wrong ...WQ, content blocker, reputation grinding like hell, on every fucking char, the fact that players in legion could not play a 2nd or 3 rd charakter untill the end of expansion ( because of AP farming grinding, what became almost a job each day to not fall behind there raid and guild members so much ) noone mentioned.the monster increase and mass at argus ( increase of 700% and even more ) als this doiesent matter now .....they all cry that azerith traits arent powerfull enough , got uned, nerfed,buffed whatever ....<br />
the only solution is , to remove the azerith traits completly from the game, give us our old sets back, change setbonus from skills to utilitys, and all is fine.</div></div><hr />

As long as all the traits are fairly close in performance, what is the issue?<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with this system is PvP being way to dependent on having the correct traits. And hearing Ion saying that the traits will get more and more powerful during the expansion, with more and more gamechanging traits, it will become a nightmare for PvPers. Good luck farming PvP RNG for the FOTM Azerite Traits for your spec.<br />
<br />
When everyone has 2 bags full of Azerite Armor &quot;just in case&quot;, it's a problem.<br />

lolI can't speak for Diablo but at least in Destiny2 the armor and weapon traits actually affect how you play. In WoW that would be the equivalent of having traits that increase the range on your Charge or Blink, or increases the total amount of soul shards by 1, etc...<br />
<br />
The traits we have now are entirely passive and useless and don't affect your gameplay. Blizzard always said that &quot;+1% Crit&quot; talents were bad design but the entire expansion is now made around that. Really out of touch :|</div></div><hr />

This adds more flexibility to you gearing choices and less headache when you actually get some of the armor. Or they could do a combination of both, have 1 empty slot on all the tiers that you can socket with the randomly generated ones as well so evennif you don't have a relic you still feel like you are getting something.</div></div><hr />

Ok, in order. We have no idea how big the beta is, and even if the all of the 1% all reported stuff in, we've been told this before. Blizz gets told about a bug, they try for a while to replicate it, and if they can't in a reasonable timeframe they move on. That's why they want us to be so detailed as much as possible. Say a mob bugs out and goes evade immune during a quest. Blizz tries to replicate it, can't do it, so they move on. Turns on the bug only happens if moonfire and the MoP Timeless Isle teleport trinket proc at the same time. You guys seriously, seriously underestimate this. <br />
<br />
Second, the small indy company meme needs to die in a fire. It's only used by naive people who think throwing bodies and/or money at something can solve any problem.

Second, the small indy company meme needs to die in a fire. It's only used by naive people who think throwing bodies and/or money at something can solve any problem. By that logic IPhones should be absolutely flawless and last forever, cause just look at how much Apple made last quarter!! /s<br />
<br />
Turns out it was easier than all that. You know... everything they are doing post launch... was explosively pointed out during beta. So at least they wouldnt have had to have 200% swings in trait strengths. Hell warriors at a 1000% change to master after launch! Don't get me wrong adjustments will always need to be made in a game as complex as WoW. But things over a 100% swings just seems like blind oversight. To the core system of the expansion no less. It is obvious they went at it alone without listening to feedback minus from MVP posters that will tell Blizzard the game is perfect most the time because it's what they are there for. I mean I know a lot of people give Preach shit but go watch his videos from alpha and beta. I mean its like a play by play of this garbage.</div></div><hr />

The truth is most ppl dont give a damn. Most ppl dont try to min max everything so they beat the game in the first week of issue. You dont need to farm azerite all day for two years to beat 99% of the content within its life time. The problem is not blizz mostly. Its the playerbase wanting to beat everything immideatly. Players asking for ridic reqs to pug. ITS A GAME. Most ppl have a real life and kids and work and dont give a shit about 99% of the complaints. Players want a reasonably balanced game in which they can have fun. All the rest is not important. In truth blizz delivers on that. The rest is useless complaining from 15 yr olds who have too much time on their hands.<br />

You DO realize how the law of averages works, don't you? You get a much clearer picture from observing something done millions of times than you do hundreds or even thousands. So a beta tester says I did this thing 100x and it did this. Then we go to live and it's done 10,000x and on average it ends being totally different. Unless you want them to turn off RNG on all spells and abilities you're going to have to accept that beta will not fix even the majority of balancing issues.<br />
<br />
Also see the post above me and the one he's referring to. You guys doing +15 keys and mythic raids already are the super tiny minority nitpicking at everything. The average joe that the game is actually for, we're having a good time not obsessing over the trees so much we can't enjoy the forest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It basically reads like this:<br />
Yeah we know the current game is shit, but not as shit as it was at a time most of the players don't even remember...<br />
And yes we know nobody likes the current azerite power and gear grind because it is daunting. But we need you to chase the carrot,<br />
because we need all of those juicy DAUs MAUs and BlizzCon Ticket cashgrabs and mount sellouts for our quarterly reports.<br />
<br />
If you don't like it, go play something else? Ohhhh wait, there is no proper MMO out there ? hahaha suck it wow playerbase and deal with it!<br />
<br />
These RNG systems are in place because they work for whatever goal the player is chasing, but they are not fun. It just keeps the money flowing.</div></div><hr />

I think the game is actually for everyone. To say other wise is pretty asshole-ish and elitist which seems to be what you are trying to paint me as ironically. The game wasn't balanced right. Blizzard itself admits it and proved it with its actions. You actually do not have to put on the white suit of armor and defend them here because they have already retreated from this line. I am going to be honest I am doing alright in BFA but for some reason you seem to think I hate the game or expansion. This isn't the case. But that doesn't mean when a piece of shit drops from the sky onto my face I am ok with it. The azerite system is trash. We know it. They admitted it. You can relax on building a wall for it. It sucks.</div></div><hr />

The game is for everyone, and most everyone is playing it and having fun. It's only the most hardcore members who are obsessing over things like azerite traits, reforging, bad trinkets, etc etc. You're so busy screaming at Blizz &quot;this could be better why aren't you fixing it&quot; that you're missing the main point... to have fun.<br />

So you disagree with the reality that those systems are just in place to keep you playing and paying?<br />
If there would be meaningfull endgame content and good ideas flowing over there at blizzard to keep the game interesting you really think we would need to bother with this kind of shity RNG systems? We as a player learned that legion grind and RNG was shit, and now we have it back even worse and under a different name? Why wouldn't a developer realise that fact.... except he's achivieng his goals and can overlook the stuff he let's his users go through.<br />
<br />
c'mon</div></div><hr />

It's a sub based game. The fact is exists is meant to keep you playing and paying. Acting like all of a sudden there's some evil conspiracy is trite.<br />
<br />
There's mythic dungeons, mythic plus, a raid you can run on whatever difficulty suits you, six zones of world quests, and pvp. All things we had in Legion. Now we add another max level zone to rare hunt, island expeditions, dueler's guild, things Legion didn't have. Seems to be there's a lot of meaningful endgame content. Not sure what RNG system you're talking about, there's always been RNG in loot. How is the AP grind for the neck worse than grinding AP for 2-4 weapons in Legion?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erous</div><div class="date">2018-09-28, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem here is that the reasoning for them reducing talent choices was because there was theoretically one path players would take based on maximizing their character for the situation. Yet, Blizzard goes and makes an entirely more complicated process by adding Azerite gear + power system and doing the same exact thing: adding traits that are in many cases useless. The only difference now is that you farm the gear and you get a random drop that's useless and have to farm the specific powers per gear piece repeatedly, instead of having the option out of the gate like we had with talents.<br />
<br />
Also, having set pieces prior gave a 'path to perfection' that helped bridge that randomness gap. We just don't have that anymore.</div></div><hr />

A trait can be uninteresting and require simming at the same time. You accomplish this by 1) wording the tooltips so vaguely that players have no way of knowing what is going on and 2) you make all traits similar and passive with zero player input interaction. You have successfully achieved this with Azerite traits.<br />
<br />
Azerite traits being closely balanced absolutely means you should be simming them, unless you have the ability to eyeball DPS increases from reading a tooltip.<br />
<br />
If Azerite traits aren't closely balanced, you pick the good one and get fucked if you don't get lucky with that slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
'We acknowledge your feed back and appreciate it. It really helps us focus on whats important.<br />
<br />
That said, I think you are just being impatient. We know you don't like it, but you just don't understand, you will! Its going to be great! Thanks for your feedback.'</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryphoon</div><div class="date">2018-09-29, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">[...] we've been told this before. Blizz gets told about a bug, they try for a while to replicate it, and if they can't in a reasonable timeframe they move on. That's why they want us to be so detailed as much as possible. <br />
<br />
If only they allowed us to type more than a tweet's worth of bug reports during Beta so we actually could describe WTF was going on and why!<br />
I can't believe people still defend Blizz and say WE are the problem somehow because we aren't doing things we can't do because we aren't given the tools needed. Countless of times I had to cut vowels, make up abbreviations and shit like that to try and fit the report. Then you can't even get an overview and edit because the damn report box is only a single line that when you try and step back you get thrown to the start of it.<br />
<br />
They don't even allow us to do what they tell us to do, then, according to you, they can't be arsed trying to decipher the reports and get on with it. No wonder the game is a mess. Also, they have stated twice now that they didn't give a fuck during Beta feedback. Both in the post above, and in the AMA.</div></div><hr />
