I have a Baby Blizzard Bear as an BoA Item sitting in a bag of one of my bank alts, allowing me to send it to any of my other alts, so they can learn it too. So...if this item works the same : you right click, you learn, it goes to pet tabs but you keep the item too, it should be.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, check your spam folder. For some reason, Blizzard decided to mask the url to the redeem page, meaning any decent filter will immediately flag it as a phishing attempt (And seriously, Blizzard, using http://mailman.netcraft.co.il/t/r/l/dkxp/yhurjyzt/r as an url?! - I was SO close to deleting the mail before I realised it was legit).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, boub if you read this, please add this part to the mainpost since it seems to confuse alot of people.<br />
For security reasons:<br />
Go to battle.net, merge your WoW account if you haven't already (Its needed to redeem the code) then click on Promotion Code Redemption on your Manage my games screen and enter the pet code there.<br />
<br />
And yes, new characters made also receive the pet in the mail, so aslong as your Goblin/Worgen x is on the same wow account they will receive the pet.</div></div><hr />

I didn't even realize this was the case until I saw it here. Out of pure habit, I didn't click the link in the email, instead I manually typed in blizzcon.com/pet into my browser and went about it that way. It worked, naturally.<br />
<br />
And I wasn't too concerned anyway because I (like anyone else in their right mind) have an authenticator.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because Marine can mean two things:<br />
<br />
1) A water animal<br />
2) A soldier of some sort.<br />
<br />
So in this case, The Marine Marine = The Water Soldier</div></div><hr />

Yeah, as the code is tied to your account which then allows your alts to also get the pet.</div></div><hr />

Yes, after getting the code redeemed your account will be flagged for it and every character you currently own or will create in the future will receive the pet in the mail.</div></div><hr />

I dual box occasionally and both are tied to one bnet account, (so I only need one authenticator) both accounts got the mail.<br />

Guys, the original date frame said 6 to 8 weeks. <br />
<br />
If we were 50000 to buy and get the code, that's 50000 email today. Yes I know Blizzard has the capacity to send out 50000 milions emails per day, but still, that makes it 50000 codes, 50000 validations, 50000 items to generate etc.<br />
<br />
EDIT : And yes, I am one of those waiting still.</div></div><hr />

Edit: Never mind. Problem occurred between keyboard and chair. Stupid was to busy doing other things that he didn't read the whole thing and missed some instructions... durrr. ::) :P</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you don't know this... but XML can only be written one real way. That way is the web-standards way. XML is an extremely picky language that reads the same on all browsers that comply with the standards. I've worked with XML before, it's a pain.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard's sites do a bit of trickery involving what they serve and browser detection. Firefox has some XML-related features that the others don't, and hence, it is served a different page from the others. I found this out a few weeks back while writing a screen scraper app for the store, back when the authenticators were almost never in stock and I wanted to get one. Making the scraper look like Firefox got back a different page from the other browsers.<br />
<br />
As for Grunty - email still hasn't shown up for me. Not in my inbox or spam folder. I sent an email to blizzcon@rayv.com to inquire about it, haven't heard back yet, but they're probably flooded at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've noticed this too. If you go to the armory, and log in and try to scrape your character's calendar, it's completely different in Firefox than it is in IE and Google Chrome. Unfortunately, neither source reveals useful information however, and the real source is delivered through AJAX apparently through a URI that's remarkably well hidden (read: I can't find it). <br />
<br />
Also yes, IE is VERY strict on rendering XML. In every case I've ever seen however, this has been a flaw with the XML. This may be the only situation ever in all time when you may applaud IE's dedication to standards.</div></div><hr />

The e-mail wasn't from Blizzard, it was sent by RayV (Sender e-mail: no-reply@rayv.com), the company that provided the video streaming for BlizzCon. Link masking is commonly used in e-mail marketing campaigns to track click-throughs. Stop blaming Blizzard for everything and actually, you know, pay attention before you qq.<br />
