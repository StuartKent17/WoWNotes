The time has come to shut this thing down. We’re going to do that at 2019-07-13T00:00:00Z. 
 
Look for something quite unusual starting at 2019-07-12T23:00:00Z.

Yeah dont get your hopes up about that, since its 1h before closing they will probably spawn bosses and overpowered enemies in the capital cities like they did when the original beta closed.</div></div><hr />

Ragnaros spawned at orgrimmar, everybody got bodied, Gamon included.<br />
All of a sudden, a GM named Layering joined the fight. he had Sylvanas as pet that would summon skeletons, but it would appear and disappear randomly because of ... layering.<br />
Ragnaros adds were lv 43 and they would drop a thunderfury with no level requirement and marked as one-hand.<br />
Then Guardians of Blizzard spawned everywhere at 15 minutes before server closure. they would melee hit for about 6k damage.<br />
this was on the PVE server.<br />
Got some screens but I can't link them unfortunately, not enough posts...</div></div><hr />

HAHAHA. MMO-C at its best. You got told off because you couldn't be bothered reading the thread. Your reaction is to just attack someone. Good work MMO-C. I expect nothing less than crybabies throwing tantrums when people call them out.</div></div><hr />

More or less this maybe some kind of ingame thank you or perhaps the scourge invasion/aq opening event.<br />
<br />
It will be something not a part of normal gameplay.</div></div><hr />
