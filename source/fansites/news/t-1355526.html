Human Racials in PvP<br />
Previously, what made EMfH and WotF such strong racial abilities is that in many cases you could simply replace the Medallion with a PvE trinket and you would have more damage as well as getting to retain some form of crowd control removal. With the change in 5.4 resulting in changes to PvP trinkets and item level caps, these racial bonuses are not as strong as they were in the past. <br />
<br />
PvE gear in instanced PvP has an item level cap, PvP gear has no item level cap. You get additional resilience from equipping a Medallion with another PvP trinket.<br />
<br />
To take a quick theory-crafting quote from this blog created by Eldacar:<br />
<br />
Eldacar:For those of you contemplating using a PVE trinket or two here are some facts to help you make your decision. The 2600 Resilience offered by the PVP trinket set bonus provides roughly 2.31% additional damage reduction from baseline, which is about 8.25% effective damage reduction after factoring in the value scaling. Furthermore the set bonus will always increase your effective health by 32.11% relative to displayed health, so if you are currently at baseline you would go from 357% EH to 389% EH.<br />
In what situations do you feel that it's more beneficial to be using an additional damage trinket over the Medallion paired with another PvP trinket to benefit from the Human and Undead racials?<br />
<br />
How can you possibly be trying to deny the superiority of PvE trinkets in the light of the past?<br />
I'm not denying their strength in the past when you were trying to push for maximum damage. Going for a PvE trinket by sacrificing the Medallion and having WotF or EMfH was by far a good choice and it's the reason we made the changes in patch 5.4. Now when you trade the Medallion for a damage trinket you are losing out on 8.25% effective damage reduction which equates to approximately 32.11% increase in effective health.<br />
<br />
Also what exactly are you talking about PvE gear cap in PvP? The way i understand it is that the cap will eventually rise to the same iLvL PvP gear is by default. so they are equal in terms of ILvL at that time. <br />
We have mentioned in the past that the item level ceiling for PvE gear will actually cap out at 512. PvP gear has an item level of 522 and is unaffected by the cap, this means that PvE gear actually misses out on 10 item levels compared to PvP gear.<br />
<br />
You think that the survivability boost given by the trinket duo will suddenly make people who try to max damage in any ways possible to not try to max damage in any way possible? <br />
It's a trade-off now and more of a choice. In the past, while not necessary, it was better to have the second damage trinket; now it's a choice between damage and survivability rather than how it was in the past where you got damage and sacrificed very little.<br />
<br />
I’m not saying that EMfH isn’t a strong racial, and the same goes for many of the racials that are available, but the changes which occurred in patch 5.4 have helped to deal with the popularity of choosing to remove the Medallion in favor of an extra damage trinket. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/272745-human-infestation-in-pvp/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8293349296?page=7#125))<br />

Character / Items<br />
Might be a short term fix, but do you think making vanity items account bound might help a little with bag space concerns?<br />
Would it be weird to get a lot of duplicate items from say quests the second or third time around? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383754019304247297))<br />
<br />
And invalidate 8 years of work and effort to improve your toon. Wasted. Why keep playing if all the work will be for nothing?<br />
If you had not put in so much effort on your character then it might have taken (and still will) 9 sec instead of 6 sec. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382251151355154432))<br />
But if you just love seeing six digit numbers fly off your character, then yes, we would be nerfing that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382251582407974912))<br />
having a new expansion overwrite your top teir raid gear with greens feels more like a waste than the number squish<br />
Currently, the raiders just get to wait longer before having to swap out to new gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383008897977438211))<br />
The counter to that is it also sucks to go for a long time with no possible upgrades. Not sure what the compromise is for that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383008817979486209))<br />
I don't see a problem. If you raided last exp, new one's lowest zones should feel easy.<br />
Agreed. It gets to be a problem when a raider ignores all rewards up until the next raid. That starts to get old. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383039137609052161))<br />
<br />
Raid Finder<br />
one more thing. One of the reasons LFR is toxic is bc its is easy. If it was hard, people would be forced to make it work.<br />
That is a nice sentiment, but we found the reality is players just bail rather than trying to make random matchmaking work. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383751887343734784))<br />
With groups of friends or even organized pugs, we find that to be much less likely. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383751954863632385))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Norushen enrage timer is a bit strict isn't it? For the third boss, i can understand later bosses but the third boss?<br />
Usually when we see this on Norushen, it's folks not doing well on the solo component, not just failing to DPS the boss enough. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382244465093517312))<br />

Only groups where all people were contributing did well and without issues. Last night we inspected 4-5 people, kickvoted them out (bad players, autoshotters, tanks with no gems, no enchants, using dps items etc.) Pretty much the difficulty of the fights got the group working for a common target: kill the boss.<br />

As I'm a casual myself and have been in several groups messing up in LFR that has failed on kor'kron shamans and Nazgrim, makes the nerfs feel good. But also makes me realize that it is still a raid, and should therefore have some skill requirements.</div></div><hr />

You wake up and realize sims mean nothing. Sims will tell you that Frost Mages are the strongest spec of all, while this is not far from the truth it is a galaxy away from the truth. Warlocks most always sim middle of the pack before BiS, but in reality when you factor in multidotting, overall encounter design, movement, execution phases, add aoe, warlocks are one of the top. So before writing next time, sit down for a minute and think. Jeez.</div></div><hr />

QQuing about bugs are normal or some overtuned mobs like the slimes which killed most of the times tanks while shamans weren't that deadly...<br />

<br />
IMHO QQ'ing about Bliz taking the easy way out, and completely ignoring the real issue is appropriate QQ.<br />
<br />
I think the vote kick debuff getting nuked, would allow the community to police itself more effectively in LFR. Though, an increased threat of being booted would probably only mean an increased &quot;quick pull&quot; strategy by those who know they are going to be kicked. In the end there would have to be some sort of kharma rating for players, and if your constantly being kicked from groups, then you wouldn't be able to queue. <br />
<br />
But hey ... it's the end of the expansion. There is very little point to doing LFR. It isn't fun.<br />

Since when BoP items can be traded?<br />
<br />
They ´were´ tradeable if you also killed that boss. Kinda like in dungeons where you can win a BOP item, but trade it to someone within 2 hours.. the same was true in Timeless island. If you got a burden off of a rare, you could trade that item to anyone else who also tagged that rare... and basically as soon as Huo died, you had people spamming /1 trying to sell the mount.<br />
<br />
Not sure why it needed to be fixed. I never sold anything, but burdens are useless on my main so it would have been nice to at least give them to other people who could use them.<br />

Nazgrim didn't need any nerf.<br />

<br />
I am not a LFR hater at all, in fact I am glad it is in the game. But I agree with you. I don´t think any LFR boss should be nerfed in the first or second week. At least keep the challenge for a short time to see if players can adapt and overcome it. Why add mechanisms at all if your first reaction to a few days of players failing them is to nerf them to where they can be ignored. Blizzard is just reinforcing bad behavior where players think they can join LFR, ignore mechanisms and still get loot. There needs to be more time to see if (force) players can learn the mechanisms.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard needs to nerf mechanisms where players can troll the group ( ie.. defensive stance for Naz, or ´crush´ from Galaron) and stuff like that. But otherwise, at least give us a few weeks to work through the mechanisms before making them ignorable.<br />
<br />

<br />
Agreed. The problem is ( in my experience).. only half the people attacking Naz in defensive stance were ´baddies´.. but there were just as many other people in raid gear who were doing it on purpose, and even lusting during it just to troll. Like the CD with galaron on crushes, they just should have limited the amount of ´bad´ that one player can do to the grou, or as you said, make the damage reflect back on that individual player, or maybe produce a stun.<br />
<br />
It really is one of the problems the ´elites´ seem to ignore when talking about LFR. As much as their are low dps players, and bad players who ignore mechanisms.. there are even MORE people in raid gear who try to troll every boss mechanism they can.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, so lets reduce the content so that's its impossible to fail.

Ok, so what you're saying is it would be ok if you zoned in, hit him with a couple spells and he died and gave you loot? I mean it's supposed to be easy right? Why not make him even easier? The FEEL of raiding is wiping. Making mistakes, learning from them by dying, and coming back in and making progression. That is what was happening in LFR. It's a friggen easy fight, one of the easiest. The boss gains benefits based on how many mistakes the raid makes. Nerfing it is the very definition of pathetic.</div></div><hr />
