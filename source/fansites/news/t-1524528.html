Warlords of Draenor - Tier 17 Rogue Armor Sets<br />

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png Free Faction Changes for Select Realms<br />
It looks like Blizzard is ready to try something new to address long battleground queues, starting with a test on US-Barthilas. <br />
<br />
As it stands, Barthilas has roughly 18.6k players with a Level 90 character on the realm. Around 14.7k of those characters are Horde and 3.9k are Alliance, resulting in a population that is 21% Alliance and 79% Horde.<br />
<br />
Looking at characters rather than players, there are ~41.7k Level 90 characters on Barthilas now, with 34.3k Horde and 7.4k Alliance, for a 17.8% Alliance and 82.2% Horde population.<br />
<br />
Holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka) also answered some common questions about the transfers on Twitter, noting that this isn't intended to solve the faction imbalance problem on many realms. <br />
<br />
Something to keep in mind about free faction transfers: The primary objective is to balance faction populations at the region level. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469164643781316608))<br />
Nice little attempt to give players corrective abilities to balance their own realms. Good luck on Mal'Ganis...<br />
Again, the intention isn't to correct realm imbalances, but region imbalance. It's unlikely Tichondrius would become 50/50. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469184533573533697))<br />
Do you think starting with smaller realms to balance the regional overflow (not wanting ques) would work?<br />
We're starting with one server to ensure we can be responsive if anything unexpected occurs. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469191766793416706))<br />
What if you don't get good results? Will you try another server? And thank you for listening to us <br />
if things go well we will expand to other realms and regions. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469207846815428608))<br />
My question was if they don't go as expected on that one server, will you still try another?<br />
We started with one server to evaluate the process not player response. If the process works properly we will expand it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469214322053230592))<br />
<br />
what is the incentive though? why would anyone at this time choose to go to the side that lower pop, and lesser racial abilities?<br />
We're trying to remove barriers first. People faction transfer all the time. They may not need added incentive. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469167563536990208))<br />
<br />
So horde-&gt;alliance is probably all we are going to see initially?<br />
Yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469165044836466689))<br />
<br />
but what about when all the alliance go horde like they've slowly been doing since faction change was implemented<br />
We aren't offering alliance to horde transfers for free. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469165237036277762))<br />
how is that helping to solve the alliance dominance on my server then? Horde is dead on my server ..<br />
it isn't meant to fix that problem (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469207711050383360))<br />
<br />
I wonder why they started with Barth? are we the guinea pig server? but I am excited. Ashran!!<br />
It was a good size and had a horde/alliance ratio we thought might attract faction changes. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469287666194726912))<br />
<br />
<br />
We consistently watch queue times for all areas of the game to try to identify problem areas where we can step in and make an improvement. Battleground queue times specifically tend to be a direct result of how many people are entering the queue at any given time from both the Horde and Alliance, within an entire region. While a number of factors can lead to longer queue times, faction interest in queuing for PvP tends to be the primary influence. For that reason we're going to be trying something new. For a limited time, and only for select realms (for this first test just a single realm), we'll be opening faction changes for Horde characters to change to Alliance for free.<br />
<br />
These changes will be provided on a limited basis to realms where we see the greatest potential for changes to occur. Guild leaders who want to Faction Change their guild for free will first need to pay for the initial transaction, but will be granted a refund* if they change to the eligible faction within the free change time frame.<br />
<br />
This first test of free faction changes will only initially be available to players on Barthilas. Eligible characters will be able to faction change from Horde to Alliance for approximately** one week beginning on Tuesday, May 27. If you're looking to faction change--and especially for any Guild leaders looking to initiate a Guild Master Faction Change (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/guild-master-realm-transfer-faction-change-procedure)--we highly recommend taking advantage of this offer as soon as possible to avoid leaving anyone behind. For more information on Faction Change eligibility and limitations, please visit the support site here (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/faction-change-basics-eligibility-and-limitations).<br />
<br />
We'll be providing updates on availability--as well as if this offer is extended to additional realms--here on the front page, so keep checking back. We look forward to your feedback on these faction changes, and ensuring you spend less time in a queue and more time slaughtering your enemies in glorious team-combat.<br />
<br />
* Eligible Guild Master Faction Change refunds will be automatically processed within 72 hours.<br />
**Faction Change availability may either be shortened or extended depending on ongoing evaluation during the faction change period.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Isn't a talent that denies another talent bad design?<br />
The problem is when one talent mandates another. It's OK if *occasionally* two talents are incompatible. Still a choice. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467990817945051138))<br />
How is that a choice? I have the choice to pick a incompatible talent? ... not a choice at all<br />
I think you may have misread. The point is that you do still have a choice, between the other two talents. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467997723321331713))<br />
what if 2 or all 3 talents are penalized/incompatible/defeat the purpose? You have only 1 remaining.. or none<br />
Then that's a problem, as I said. We try to never do that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468001738801172481))<br />
and 75 talents, if you are not a BM hunter, you dont want any of that as its tuned around BM mastery.<br />
That's... not actually true, you realize? It doesn't matter if a row is stronger for one spec; row is still balanced. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468007886291861504))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y))<br />
So Army is losing its Defensive properties then with it being instant or will blood gain a small defensive boost for short time?<br />
No; the 4sec of damage reduction is remaining. Yes, that's a buff, since it's no longer in lieu of being able to dodge/parry. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467820854563196928))<br />
<br />
BT Is the only option now in that tier and that is also passive as most people just macro it. That tier is illusion of choice.<br />
Are you a PvP-oriented Unholy DK? For every other combo that tier has some of the most talent diversity. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468572025510830080))<br />
I'm a PvE raider. Every DW DK runs BT, 2H runs RE and so on. No choice there for PvE. Sorry I'm just not seeing choice there<br />
Of Frost DKs who killed a boss in N/H SoO last week, here is the T5 talent breakdown: 43.93%, 29.81%, 26.26%. Guess which is which? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468576674385121281))<br />
The point here is that different people can view choice differently. Sometimes each might think theirs is the only &quot;right&quot; answer. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468577239391404032))<br />
I agree. The 43% is obviously BT, the other two are way low meaning they need help. Just spice them up so aren't so boring.<br />
The 43.93% is actually Runic Empowerment. Go figure, right? (BT pulls ahead if you look at Heroic exclusively, but it's still close.) (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468580214000189440))<br />
Can you see whats chose for raids or just &quot;who killed a boss&quot; &amp; &quot;what they have now&quot; independently? I switch for raids<br />
The former - can look at it boss-by-boss, or for BGs, or arenas, etc. As you say, it wouldn't be accurate otherwise. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468585751475539969))<br />
<br />
Will AMZ stay a talent for dks, when all other minor raid cooldowns are given to classes baseline?<br />
There are many talented forms of raid utility. It's actually a benefit to the class to be able to trade it for something... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468583999909031936))<br />
...else in the situation that it's not particularly useful. There are several talented raid utility abilities. Examples: ... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468584199633371136))<br />
Nature's Vigil, Heart of the Wild, Ancestral Guidance, Hand of Purity, Clemency, Sacred Shield, Safeguard, Vigilance, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468584610100543489))<br />
But then blood gets it, I thought you were removing all raid cds from tanks.<br />
A very fair question. We've not reduced tanks to zero, just as much as we can without hitting talents. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468586993069215744))<br />
AMZ is more a raid CD than those types of utility though<br />
It's no more of a raid CD than Nature's Vigil or Chi Burst or Ancestral Guidance, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468587517998923776))<br />
Er, you might not have intended it that way but it's very much viewed (and assessed) as a raid CD by DKs today.<br />
Er, I'm agreeing that it's a raid CD. And pointing out that there are many talented raid CDs; it's not unique in that regard. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468643181848825857))<br />
<br />
...Blood DKs feel that Purgatory is a must since it acts as a cheat death. That's huge for a spec like Blood.<br />
And AMZ isn't valuable during progression? It depends upon the fight; in many cases AMZ is better. Lichborne too (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468647401012465664))<br />
If you're seeing any DPS/Tank DKs take Lichborne widely in PvE, I'd be very interested in hearing about it.<br />
I was referring to the 6.0 version of Lichborne. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468648158113718272))<br />
One quick question- is 6.0 Lichborne still a CD, or does the Leech have a passive component?<br />
Still 2min CD. I believe it's 15% Leech, offhand. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468652327553871872))<br />

Hunters also have no stackable raid utility, will we be getting one in WoD?<br />
Yes. We're working on solving that problem. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467596503628787712))<br />
<br />

Thanks for forcing RoP on us for some progression fights. I'm so excited to hate playing my class.<br />
No idea where this is suddenly coming from, but you can help spread the word that it's not the case. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467322718791020544))<br />
If RoP is superior to MI or IF, we have to use it. Just like LB &gt; NT for single target now, even if I hate LB I have to use it.<br />
Extremely different situations. LB was fully intended to be better than NT for single target. RoP is not in that situation. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467329341609611264))<br />

Will &quot;Death from Above&quot; profit from Sub Mastery and Revealing Strike? How will it be balanced for Mut against Envenom?<br />
We're working on a tweak to it to solve that concern, actually. Looking like we'll have it do an Envenom/Eviscerate on land. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467329732082536448))<br />

any plans to add a ranged component to lava lash during ascendance? It's a serious quality of life issue for enhancement shamans<br />
No; it's intentional that you do &quot;nearly 100%&quot; of your damage from ranged, not &quot;fully 100%&quot;, with Ascendance. That's so... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468875427189379072))<br />

whats the reasoning for the warrior talent change: Storm Bolt replacing Blade Storm in the line up? is it just for pvp balance?<br />
We feel the talent grouping makes more sense. It puts DPS cooldowns together and CC abilities together. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/467383076499103744))<br />
<br />
Glyph of Unending Rage is very powerful for all War Specs and near mandatory. Happy with req Glyph or chance of making baseline?<br />
Worth considering, but how mandatory it is may significantly change in WoD; waiting to see. Regardless &quot;Mandatory-&gt;Baseline&quot;... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467790338208198657))<br />
...is generally a thought process that glosses over the fact that that's a net buff to the class. Easy mistake to make. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467790864190672897))<br />
Wtb hints on arms changes<br />

Will prot mastery benefit gladiator stance at all?<br />
Yes; mastery grants +%AP for tanks. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468705312891891712))<br />
About this, will Mastery's AP scaling for tanks be tuned differently for each tank?<br />
If needbe. So far, no, but we haven't fine-tuned performance yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468874289769627650))<br />

Do you think we can have full spell effects out in the world and only diminish them in raid environments?<br />
That's the plan (other than in large concentrations of players even outdoors, such as Ashran). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468643525651730434))<br />

It's good for loot distribution, competition, variety, and interest, for different items to be valuable to different people. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468642050749906944))<br />
Had they changed stats, a given ring would be useful to everyone of a role. Rings that 2/3 of the raid rolls on... CC: @olandgren (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468642554355793920))<br />

Is there any intention to help alts with upgrades? Will take 4 months to upgrade a full gearset with a weekly 1k valor cap.<br />
The increase is mainly to let already-capped players continue progressing. If your gear is unupgraded you don't have that issue. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468815181401702403))<br />

Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
With the upcoming stat squish, will we feel weaker when soloing old raid content compared to how it is now?<br />
No, not at all. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467299908869832704))<br />
<br />
You mentioned that necks, ring etc with spirit will be useless for dps in 6.0. Same for mail gear? Will be super annoying as ele<br />
Nope. Mail gear will not have Spirit on it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467306891966967808))<br />
<br />
will secondary stats weigh equally for each spec so we can stack what we think is more fun, not which is &quot;more dps&quot;?<br />
We don't aim for perfect equality (and that that's not even feasible most of the time). But, we are aiming for much closer. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467320177445457921))<br />

Can trinket procs or weapon enchants multi-strike? Or is multi-strike focused on player abilties.<br />
If you're referring to ones that do damage, such as Elemental Force, yes, the damage can Multistrike. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468588506197925888))<br />

PvE<br />
Is the new recharging rez system for flexible difficulties only or mythic too?<br />
For all difficulties - a Mythic raid will be treated the same as a 20-player Normal/Heroic raid. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/467736988964376576))<br />
<br />
Kind of puzzled at the LFR Garrosh timer increase as opposed to a health reduction. 18+ minute LFR fight is a little long, no?<br />
Vast majority of LFR Garrosh kills are well short of that, but if you made it that far, a sub-10% zerk wipe is the worst thing. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468780542520197120))<br />

Thoughts about honor from bgs after the buff? It still feels like it's WAY too little honor for how much you need on a new toon.<br />

What's your opinion on &quot;Prideful Conquest&quot; being account-wide. The catch up is brutal for most people.<br />
I've done the catchup myself through pugs several times. I think it works great. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/468772621899689984))<br />
And then you're still behind on gear.<br />
The intention isn't to catch all the way up. Playing consistently should have an advantage. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/468773797877665792))<br />
I guess you're right. I guess I'm just the minority that feels rated PvP shouldn't be an uneven playing field.<br />
there others with that opinion. I think WoW strikes a good balance. There is progression but fairly easy to get to full gear. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/468777869561184256))<br />

Random question, but is there a particular reason that there is no cooldown text on action bar buttons by default?<br />

No idea where this is suddenly coming from, but you can help spread the word that it's not the case.<br />
<br />
The community sentiment against RoP isn't &quot;suddenly&quot; coming from anywhere. The majority of Mages (on the forums and Twitter, which I'll admit is small compared to the number of players but does tend to be the more progression-oriented base) dislike the talent - but, more importantly, have realised that the lvl 90 talents HAVE to be balanced around the flat damage buff. Incanter's Flow and Mirror Image have to average out to a 15% damage increase, or perhaps slightly worse if played poorly.<br />
The idea of the tier as one that focuses on a constant damage increase should be scrapped. It's never been fun, just maintenancy.</div></div><hr />

Of Frost DKs who killed a boss in N/H SoO last week, here is the T5 talent breakdown: 43.93%, 29.81%, 26.26%. Guess which is which? (WatcherDev)<br />
The point here is that different people can view choice differently. Sometimes each might think theirs is the only &quot;right&quot; answer. (WatcherDev)<br />
I agree. The 43% is obviously BT, the other two are way low meaning they need help. Just spice them up so aren't so boring.<br />
The 43.93% is actually Runic Empowerment. Go figure, right? (BT pulls ahead if you look at Heroic exclusively, but it's still close.)&quot;<br />

if he pruned the logs down to just characters who achieves 8/14H he would notice a huge number of people going for BT.</div></div><hr />

I get what aesthetic they were trying to accomplish here, a kind of master poisoner, but I feel like they shoehorned &quot;savage&quot; into the armor set. What is up with the Blades and spikes on the helmet/shoulderpads? Why are there metal links on the pants? Those elements seem like they belong on a warrior armor set, not a rogue. Really, the only blades I like on the set are the blades dripping with poison. Although I would have rather preferred they put that effect back on weapons when the player put on their poisons rather than put it on a single armor set. Regardless, they could have implemented the &quot;savage&quot; feel in other ways instead of just putting spikes on armor. Maybe some bloodstains on the armor, have the little daggers made of bone or stone, shrink the armor to show a little more skin because the rogue isn't afraid of taking a few hits (they're remodeling the character models anyways), or anything other than just slapping spikes on the damn thing. As for the mythic set, it reminds me more of the iteration Bane from Batman when he used Venom than a poisoner. Really, an alchemist/poisoner should strive to pump the enemy with poison, not him/herself. The belt should have poison vials/bottles on it, maybe have the assets from the other tier sets to get the armor dripping with poison, throwback to old crafting poisons by having some Deathweed stuffed in a pouch, or really a multitude of other things that are not what is currently there. Disappointed....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Freeasacar</div><div class="date">2014-05-26, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys, long-time Barthilas player here. Just thought you might like to hear my perspective on the free faction swaps offered to us.<br />
<br />
A little bit of history about Barthilas' faction imbalance first. The population was nowhere near this unbalanced as recently as the end of Cata. Only in MoP did the big Alliance guilds start moving to other servers (primarily Frostmourne) and now here at the end of the expansion it's eventually become the ghost town it is today. Sure, the old players that many still know are still around, lord knows it's hard to ignore them when they come and try to gank us at the Horde shrine daily. But really there's not much reason to be over on our Alliance side when you could just hop realms. I think the best example of this was back in the Summer when ~100 Horde literally walked (not ran) their mammoth mounts into the Alliance shrine and cleared it out with ease.<br />
<br />
Will this be the start of a great migration of the population over to Alliance? Maybe. But it'll take a lot of faith from a lot of people. The infrastructure just isn't there in the form of large raiding guilds and a considerably active community. Only if enough people move over to stoke the once-flickering fire of the Alliance side will we see anything close to faction balance again.<br />
<br />
To be honest I'm really not sure why they chose us for this experiment. We're quite an unusual server since we're only freshly imbalanced and we already have a really small community with a handful of players that everyone knows on the unbalanced side. It was balanced in it's own strange way. Meanwhile though, servers like Stormrage (where I originally started) have been unbalanced for far longer and have even less active unbalanced sides. Those are the servers that really need it, not so much us.</div></div><hr />

I recommend not sitting down then.<br />
<br />
From a design standpoint, they could always disable sit when wearing that armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True . It wont balance anything. Someone must be crazy to leave the Dominant faction in his server to join the lesser 1. Merging servers is the key . If they dont understand that they must move fast to this direction then its their loss. My server is Hellscream -EU . They promised us a merge with Aggramar-EU months ago. It failed. Then nothing happened. No ETA no responce from Blizz. Nothing. We just wait ....and wait ....and wait . PPl in dead realms are starving for attention. We need a solution..... any solution<br />
I know your post was about balancing issues and not about dead realms but damn i am really :mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know people like smaller pop servers but imho once you try a higher pop realm you realise how terrible it can be.. especially when its heavily one sided on a PVP server.. Try doing quests, try leaving the shrine, sitting on timeless isle.. and trying to do the Rare/elites on timless.. UGH tedious<br />
<br />
Stupid people and new players will take the FC only. <br />
<br />
Also as a raider who would take the lesser racials ?</div></div><hr />

&quot;I'm a PvE raider. Every DW DK runs BT, 2H runs RE and so on. No choice there for PvE. Sorry I'm just not seeing choice there<br />
Of Frost DKs who killed a boss in N/H SoO last week, here is the T5 talent breakdown: 43.93%, 29.81%, 26.26%. Guess which is which? (WatcherDev)<br />
The point here is that different people can view choice differently. Sometimes each might think theirs is the only &quot;right&quot; answer. (WatcherDev)<br />
I agree. The 43% is obviously BT, the other two are way low meaning they need help. Just spice them up so aren't so boring.<br />
The 43.93% is actually Runic Empowerment. Go figure, right? (BT pulls ahead if you look at Heroic exclusively, but it's still close.)&quot;<br />
<br />
if he pruned the logs down to just characters who achieves 8/14H he would notice a huge number of people going for BT.<br />
Pruning down to a group that isnt getting the job done proves what? This blue was an excellent FU to every player who thinks they have enough info to speak for everyone else. Its a tough pill, but swallow it: most of the time your assumptions are pure shite.</div></div><hr />

I love how blizdevs try to confuse people pointing out idiocy of their &quot;design&quot; by presenting irrelevant or intentionally misrepresented stats, going as far as an actual bait and switch-type action:<br />

Will you never learn people? :D Why even bother to voice a legitimate concern if the best you can get in response is some open and blatant BS?<br />
Watcher's response has nothing to do with the question.<br />
The question was about DW and DW alone when referring to BT and 2H when referring to RE, regardless of how successful their groups were LAST WEEK. Response is about FDKs (both DW and 2H) who happen to belong to groups which killed a boss in N/H last week. The two groups certainly overlap, but whatever stats say for group 2, it has no relevance whatsoever for group 1. First thing is, boss kill depends on a couple more factors in the group than what resource talent the FDK took. I also have a feeling DW/2H distribution in group 2 might be curiously similar to its distribution of BT vs. RE. Add in the fact 2H needs 1 good weapon less than DW to be topped up for current progression stage and Watcher's sophistry becomes amusingly obvious.<br />
Unfortunately the player took him for a half-honest participant in a discussion and thought Watcher wanted to show as much as half DW takes other talents than BT. What a mistake. I wonder if Watcher had of those &quot;oh fuck he might catch me out and show just what a piece of shit I am&quot; moments followed by a hearty sigh when the bait was taken. Afterwards it was just a matter of a couple snide remarks and voila, issue addressed, the talent tier in question can stay boring as a dead sheep.<br />
<br />
Still, blatant sophistry on the part of blizdevs is not half as hillarious as the epic crack-licking some players seem to enjoy:<br />

Provide statistics showing the pop of 2H F-DKs is same or higher than DW for either of those groups, or save the snarky angst for guild chat. And what of the 30% using neither BT nor RE. Must be the sophistry...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't have to, don't need to. The simple fact a player voiced a concern regarding specific distribution of 2H/DW talents and got a response about something else, clearly designed to mislead him, is perfectly enough. Well, enough for people who fail to appreciate Bliizchoc of course.</div></div><hr />
