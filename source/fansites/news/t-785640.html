[Character Copy] Epic Pre-mades Available!<br />
Pre-made characters with level 359 epic gear are now available and ALL should have functional tradeskills. We've also reset everyone's available character copies back to 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
HEROIC Blackwing Descent now open for testing<br />
Reposting this one as a full front page news because it's a pretty huge change!<br />
We're going to open Blackwing Descent for testing today, and Heroic difficulty will now be available. The zone will stay open for at least a day to allow different regions to test the content.<br />
<br />
Throne of the Four Winds and Bastion of Twilight will be closed for now. They'll open up later. <br />
<br />
Rated BG's are now available!<br />
I am happy to announce that rated battlegrounds are now available in the beta. The bracket is set to 10v10 for this period of testing. We will rotate the brackets to get testing in all areas as we see fit. Please queue up and leave us any feedback that you find on the system.<br />
<br />
We will be setting up a &quot;play with the devs&quot; focused test for Rated BG's sometime next week. Be on the lookout for a post with more info soon. <br />
<br />
Yeah, I have loads of questions about rated BGs. It sounds like it's &quot;Guild BGs With Ratings&quot;, rather than Rated BGs; if I'm not misinformed, all members of a BG &quot;team&quot; have to be in the same guild, no?<br />
Your guild membership has no impact on rated BG teams. You can form a raid to join up no matter what guild you are in. However, if you join a rated BG with the minimum number of required guild members, you will earn guild xp for a win. You will be notified in the top right of your screen via a guild banner that you are in a guild group.<br />
<br />
It actually sounds like there is a lot of confusion going on with players about rated battlegrounds in general. I will get a basic FAQ together and get it posted ASAP. <br />
<br />
<br />
Region Wide Battlegroup Matching<br />
As we previously announced, we’re in the process of rolling out region-wide battleground matchmaking. Once completed, all realms for our North American players will be matching together for battlegrounds, and four larger groups for dungeon finder use. This is a large technical undertaking, and while we’re extremely excited to see this huge advancement in connecting players within World of Warcraft, the complexity means we’ll be rolling it out slowly in a staggered approach.<br />
<br />
Battlegroup listings and which realms are within each can be found at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/battlegrounds/battlegroups/<br />
<br />
Phase 1 - Complete<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
The below battlegroups are now linked for battleground matchmaking.<br />
<br />
Whirlwind<br />
Emberstorm<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon Finder<br />
The below battlegroups are now linked within their group for dungeon finder matchmaking.<br />
<br />
Group A<br />
Whirlwind<br />
Emberstorm<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 2 – Implemented 11/3/10<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
Two additional battlegroups are added and all four are linked for battleground matchmaking.<br />
<br />
Whirlwind<br />
Emberstorm<br />
Vengeance<br />
Bloodlust<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon Finder<br />
The below realms are linked within their groups for dungeon finder matchmaking. In the final phase, all realms are expected to be grouped in this manner based on their physical locations.<br />
<br />
Group A<br />
Whirlwind<br />
Emberstorm<br />
Group B<br />
Stormstrike<br />
Nightfall<br />
Retaliation<br />
<br />
<br />
Final Phase – TBD based on performance of previous phases<br />
<br />
We’ll be updating this thread as these phases progress. <br />

Leveling speed on beta<br />
Just to follow-up on the question about the 80 to 85 leveling experience in the beta, we feel it's where it needs to be right now. We feel the current pacing is correct, based on what each zone supports via quests while allowing you to mix and match dungeon runs along the way. Keep in mind though that there are always those that are likely to power level their way to 85 fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that the leveling experience now (1-60) will be changing. I guess we will see if the perception of whether it's too fast or not will change based on that. At the very least the flow of how you level should be improved. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27495546183/we-level-too-quickly-anymore/))<br />
<br />
Magmaw Testing (Blackwing Descent)<br />
Magmaw was not available for testing previously simply due to some bugs that needed to be fixed. Magmaw will be available for testing sooner than you think. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27497530630/magmaw/))<br />
<br />
New official forums<br />
These new forums will be available &quot;soonerino&quot; and I'm glad you asked. While we obviously can't mind control everyone or force anyone to make certain sorts of posts, we CAN encourage you all to report those that violate the forum Code of Conduct AND we can also encourage you all to uprate or downrate posts you like or don't like. By doing so, you can bring to light the posts you see as better quality or help hide the ones you feel just don't cut it. Keep in mind though, it's just a tool to be used, and it's up to you all to use it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27497536722/new-forums-quality-of-post/))<br />

AE Healing nerf<br />
The beta still does not have all of our AE nerfs, so e.g. Holy Radiance and Efflorescence are still healing by too much. Once those numbers kick in, then we can lower AE damage accordingly. Priest and shaman AE healing are closer to our targets. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27509096887/healing-in-raids-and-why-it-s-not-working/))<br />

Buffs effects on pets<br />
We believe all of these buffs are affecting pet stats correctly (meaning that the pet does not get buffed directly but inherits the master's stats). Sometimes you may need to reequip a piece of gear or zone to get the tooltip to update correctly, if for example you have just spec'ed into Trueshot Aura.

Backstab isn't nerfed, and tooltips are lying to you<br />
Backstab is also 200% at level 80. If you are on beta, you may have a tooltip that says 150%, but it is lying to you. If you are on live, it has always been 200% and will stay that way for Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Below level 80, Backstab (and other attacks) will do less weapon damage, which is really all this change was trying to accomplish. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27497536585/rogues-yes-nerf-more/))</div></div><hr />

warriors are doing just fine as of right now. we are not balanced around 1v1 and coupled with any sort of heals we can cause some serious dmg. And finally we can put out mad pressure in pvp without having to rely on a 1 minute + cd. We are getting some actual CC now as well. Honestly, i think warriors as of right now look to be the most fun they've been in a long time.<br />

I have had about 10 or so say they are quitting and they were fairly good at what they did. I played a healer myself but I doubt I will. What they see as a &quot;challenge&quot; I see as a inconvenience and annoyance. <br />
<br />
It's more trouble than its worth and the very reason I stopped healing in BC until they buffed mana regen. The challenge should come from the instance or raid its self NOT based on the players ability to hold threat or manage mana.</div></div><hr />

And finally we can put out mad pressure in pvp without having to rely on a 1 minute + cd. We are getting some actual CC now as well. Honestly, i think warriors as of right now look to be the most fun they've been in a long time.<br />
<br />
you will barely notice the lack of self heals. its not the end of the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
They really arent, I have been pvping on my warrior nonstop since the patch came out and they are way worse. Bladestorm is the worst 51 talent point anyone has, it is easily disarmed and does little to no damage, most warriors only use it as a 2nd trinket.<br />
<br />
The worst idea of all was to let range run and cast/shoot, I have been killed so many times while I am trying to get to them but am dead before I can get to them due to them running and casting, it fills in the gaps where warriors were able to keep it even with the amount of damage output. Charge usually bugs out so it either doesnt stun them or it does and they are 10 feet away from where you charge and now all casters can take advantage of the deadzone of charge and intercept and just sit in between that range and run and cast.....its bullshit.<br />
<br />
Now our healing got nerfed, it was a small amount as it was but could actually turn the tides in a battle every now and then, noone will choose those talents now, noone wants to put 3 points into a talent to get healed for 3%. Blizzard allow hybrid classes to heal ridiculous amounts regardless of being a full dps class but a warrior cant heal 1/10 of their health on a situational basis?<br />
<br />
We in no way top charts in either damage or heals, unlike locks, boomkins and shadow priests can but we still get the nerfs. I enjoy my warrior alot more when I have a healer but I shouldnt be a useless class without one, we bring nothing to the table that is individual to our class anymore...we have nothing another class cant do better, I almost felt sick when blizzard said warriors are the most mobile class........we arent even in the top 3 for most mobile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 GCD, 1 Rune, 30 second CD - 15% health (with the possibility of the CD even being reset) <br />
<br />
2 GCD, 40 Runic power (which costs 4 runes to accumulate), 3 minute cooldown - 25% health <br />
<br />
<br />
..... 6 times longer cooldown and instead of 1 GCD it takes 2, and technically takes 3 more runes for 10% more health.</div></div><hr />

<br />
honestly, from the way it sounds, it seems like you are having more of an issue with pvp in general than with warriors being underpowered. warriors are definitely one of the most mobile classes in the game. And jumping charge has been an issue for a while, once you get piercing howl though, it wont be as noticeable. we can finally dump out mad pressure without having to rely on UA op&gt;ms&gt;hs&gt;op&gt;bs. We can actually set up cc, we can actually control what happens in a match. And considering we will be getting leap, we will have a THIRD gap closer, with an aoe snare (piercing).<br />
<br />
all of these things make warriors look extremely promising.<br />
<br />
and with the self healing, you need to keep in mind we have field dressing, blood craze, enraged regen and second wind. All of that coupled with heals would be extremely overpowered and would be borderline ridiculous. <br />
<br />
the nerf to self healing is easily justifiable</div></div><hr />

Simple answer, PvP complaints from other classes. PvP, a game within a game, the most powerful force in WoW, summoner of the mighty nerf bat, the only power that was capable of defeating the Scourge Invasion, scaring the bejesus out of Blizzard so much they had to bring it a quick and limp wristed ending.</div></div><hr />

This is why I feel sorry for the dev team sometimes. You try and make the game fun, challenging, and require skill. Then you get guys like this who complain they have to press more than two buttons and maybe worry about mana for once.<br />

You have to be joking. I just started playing my warrior again after 4 months and I am completely amazed how good they are now. In BG's I am next to unstoppable going 35-0 with a healer. 1v1 I can pretty much beat out any class besides mages, hell I can even take out healers (even holy paladins given enough time). Bladestorm is still amazing, just pop sweeping strikes + storm and you kill everyone within 5 yards of you. Warriors heals are pretty ridiculous right now in BG's, especially with the massive victory rush buff. I am able to do massive of chains of 1v1's just because I can literally heal 30% of my health in a couple of seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have to correct you here. Not trying to be a douchebag, but you've neevr cosidered that the reason might be that you haven't managed to addapt to the changes yet?<br />
I have a third main that is a warrior in relentless gear, and wich I haven't played in 2-3 months. Right after the patch we ere weak, yes. then blizzard patched th game some more and now we're more then fine.<br />
<br />
yes I get raped by balance druids or fire mages or destrolocks if I have spellreflect. shield wall and trinket on cd when they jump me with all their cd's ready. I'd expect nothing else, when caster atm a a little too powerfull all around on the dmg part (allthough warrs are pretty brutal too right now).<br />
<br />
I usually end up in top5 KB /and or HK in bg's, with almost allways very few deaths. I beat most people I meet. In duels it's 50/50 really. It all depends what spec you meet. <br />
<br />
All in all I have decided that my warr is gonna be my new main in cata, now that ArP is gone forever (I hate playing something that people call OP, so I change my main if that happens, lol)<br />
<br />
The only beef I have is with bladestorm, allthough it's no nearly as bad as people make it sound.<br />
Yes it does less dmg, But it still helps you kill that frostmage sometimes if you make him make mistakes. I wwouldn't trade it for anything honestly.<br />
<br />
edit: Oh and the healing nerf is probs because health pools are getting bigger in coparison to the dmg and healing output, and that if it stayed unnerfed it would become OP I guess.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urikslargda</div><div class="date">2010-11-05, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They really arent, I have been pvping on my warrior nonstop since the patch came out and they are way worse. Bladestorm is the worst 51 talent point anyone has, it is easily disarmed and does little to no damage, most warriors only use it as a 2nd trinket.<br />
<br />
The worst idea of all was to let range run and cast/shoot, I have been killed so many times while I am trying to get to them but am dead before I can get to them due to them running and casting, it fills in the gaps where warriors were able to keep it even with the amount of damage output. Charge usually bugs out so it either doesnt stun them or it does and they are 10 feet away from where you charge and now all casters can take advantage of the deadzone of charge and intercept and just sit in between that range and run and cast.....its bullshit.<br />
<br />
Now our healing got nerfed, it was a small amount as it was but could actually turn the tides in a battle every now and then, noone will choose those talents now, noone wants to put 3 points into a talent to get healed for 3%. Blizzard allow hybrid classes to heal ridiculous amounts regardless of being a full dps class but a warrior cant heal 1/10 of their health on a situational basis?<br />
<br />
We in no way top charts in either damage or heals, unlike locks, boomkins and shadow priests can but we still get the nerfs. I enjoy my warrior alot more when I have a healer but I shouldnt be a useless class without one, we bring nothing to the table that is individual to our class anymore...we have nothing another class cant do better, I almost felt sick when blizzard said warriors are the most mobile class........we arent even in the top 3 for most mobile.<br />
<br />
Excessive QQ, man. Most of the Tier-7 talents are lackluster, are they not? Yeah, Howling Blast is good, but Gargoyle and DRW? Very expensive and situational at best. Berserk, maybe. Meh.<br />
<br />
No mobility? lol. Try Death Grip for a while and see if you don't end up being grateful for Intervene/Intercept/etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I the only one that thinks the Death Pact heal nerf was unnecessary? I mean Death pact is nearing being useless compared to how rune tap works.. <br />
<br />
1 GCD, 1 Rune, 30 second CD - 15% health (with the possibility of the CD even being reset) <br />
<br />
2 GCD, 40 Runic power (which costs 4 runes to accumulate), 3 minute cooldown - 25% health <br />
<br />
<br />
..... 6 times longer cooldown and instead of 1 GCD it takes 2, and technically takes 3 more runes for 10% more health.<br />
<br />
I completely agree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mages should have a 100% HP evo and also faster then 10sec cast. I think rogues heal is fine now, but dks and warriors heals are still too strong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
having to actually make decisions and using abilities at the appropriate times will actually have a significance now. Sorry you'll actually have to pay attention to more than just the meters now.<br />
<br />
This is a game. I wonder if ppl still know what that word means ... it's supposed to be fun. Not grief. The game isn't being played as we intend it to be played? WTF who is complaining?<br />
Typically blizz. nerf something in the ground than buff into oblivion just to keep yurself bussy and at a job.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vordigan</div><div class="date">2010-11-06, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why the hell did they nerf warrior healing?<br />
<br />
We already suck enough as it is.<br />
<br />
Well. the part &quot;We already suck enough as it is&quot; is totaly your mistake, or miss of hability, BUT, However, Nerf warrior healing, they, absolutely maken a mistake.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Ok The New patch, bring many things very good to warriors, that we who play with them do not have seen at along time...<br />
<br />
Now think about, Warriors, are a class of &quot;Hits&quot; Dmgs, without &quot;magic dmg&quot;, soo, all that we can have its a little self healing, like the 10% of healing that was still little, BUT Great enough! <br />
<br />
Its not a balanced thing nerf Warriors Self healing.... Think About, how is the DK self healing? and now, Rogues and Mages, can heal very well.... but no problem since they DONT nerf our Warrior self heals.</div></div><hr />
