Emerald Dream<br />
Even if pretty much anyone on earth know that Northrend will be part of the expansion, I'm still not sure if the Emerald Dream will be here. Theorically we could use the 4 portals in Azeroth to access Northrend through the Emerald Dream, technically the Crystalsong Forest (http://www.wowwiki.com/Crystalsong_Forest) could be the starting zone in Northrend. <br />
<br />
The Emerald Dream is pretty big though, and I don't really see why Blizzard would use it as a simple transition zone, maybe they're just planning to release an uber-big expansion. <br />
<br />
I'm posting this because while I was going through the 2.2 PTR Patch MPQ files, I noticed that two textures from the Emerald Dream was updated in this patch. <br />

Expansion<br />
While we wait for the Blizzcon, I'll post a few expansions informations depending of the mood. I'll add a probability % to each, they're not 100% accurate but they should be decently reliable.<br />
Level cap should be 80, not 75. (90% Sure)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That itself could indicate that those &quot;big plans&quot; were not to make it an expansion, but that the Northrend expansion actually allows this to be an instance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course they could also just include Emerald Dream because they do not want to begin adding undermine, kul'tiras etc. :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eternity</div><div class="date">2007-08-01, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tigole stated in late May 2007 that Blizzard has &quot;actually done a lot of work on the Emerald Dream but we scrapped what we had for bigger, grander plans.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Nethaera said in September 2006 that &quot;As for the Emerald Dream, there are no plans for anything as of yet but it is a consideration for the future. The Emerald Dream opens up a lot of different opportunities and the Burning Crusade is definitely not going to be the last of the expansion packs. There are many different places and storylines that can be pursued. The story is going to keep growing and as it does so, people will get to experience it.&quot;<br />
<br />
doesn't this meaning emerald dream is far from being ready ?</div></div><hr />

They did it because thanks to you, whole community is confused, waiting for something that Blizz might had no intention to give us. Although you may think of it as some sort of an accomplishment of yours, - ruling out the competition, and then turning your site into yellow press center. gj.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways, maybe you'll access Nothrend via one of the portals but since they were corrupted you'll need to take the last one to the emerald dream (which I'm afraid would open in the expansion after this one, of course, that's pure suspition from me as I haven't read anything that would go that way, well, anywhere, but I still think it would make sense, or at leats something similar). The emerald dream is supposed to be not big, but rather huge as it is a version of theworld without the corruption of anything (Elves, humans, trolls, etc. only nature rules it, or so it did untill the Nightmare came in to corrupt it). Therefore I would expect the emerald dream to be a massive expansion including just about all of Azeroth (northrend and Kalimbor included)...<br />
Then again, it's only 2days away, so we'll know soon how wrong I am :-)<br />
<br />
PS: I'm serious about that hug!</div></div><hr />

I support you fullheartedly.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malineros</div><div class="date">2007-08-01, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be nice and it would be fun, but I doubt it's coming so soon. Blizzard had been pretty open about how far development of the Dream went and its being put aside for other things. We still don't what the force behind the Nightmare is, so it could easily be something so powerful that we'd need to be 90 or 100 for it.<br />
<br />
That said, whenever ED is added to the game, if it's supposed to be Azeroth as if untouched by the &quot;corruption&quot; or changes wrought by the races, then how would there be outposts/towns/cities? Would we have to hearth/port back to waking Azeroth everytime we need to visit a vendor/bank/etc.?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well ED will eventually be added to problems like these are soemthing Blizz should fix.....this doesnt mean that ED wont come anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Atleast they spoke about ED's completion rate...they didnt about Northrend so maybe Northrend is at 0% and Emerald Dream almost done.<br />
<br />
For all we know the Nightmare can also be a lv 80 raid mob...... while they said that Arthas would come at lv 90 or something this would make any man think that next expansion would be ED if it werent for the numerous rumors<br />
<br />
So all cross ur fingers for ED and class specific Hero classes......</div></div><hr />
