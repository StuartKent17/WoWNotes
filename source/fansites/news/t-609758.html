<br />
Why? Because he has the money to support some fun? This &quot;sick freak&quot; is obviously better off than you. :)<br />
<br />
Rich people spend there money on what they choose, 99.9% of them being much more expensive than a pair of 500pound computers and £89 a month, anyhow i heard a rumour that chinese wow subscription is £5 a month - What is £50-£89 a month for good entertainment, Look at xbox360 games:<br />
<br />
The RRP for GTA:IV is £44.99, and this game definatly has less playtime than WoW (10 WoW's in this case) - He will be working on Zul'aman soon so much more challenge to go - and in WoTLK every raid will have a 10 man alternative, i'd imagine he is having great fun beating the challenges.<br />
<br />
Heck, a smoker spends alot of money on there addiction and this is certainly a waste of money. So i guess you walk past smokers and call them sick freaks , although i know you would only say it online because you feel safe making insults whilst under the anomnity of the interwebz :)<br />

Nah. CWOWs payments arent monthly. it depends on the time you play, so its more like hourly payment, since players aged under 18 have 5hr play time per day restriction.</div></div><hr />

He already said it was for the fun of doing it - and to prove that he can. If you read the forum post he made, you'll see how he discusses how he achieved most bosses with his setup.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">omglazor</div><div class="date">2008-07-15, 03:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To some of the posters above about a quad-boxed ele shaman setup. I am pretty sure it doesn't get any cheesier than 4 elemental shaman hitting 1 target with a lightning at THE EXACT SAME TIME. This is not a question of whether this is allowed by EULA or that it's still 1 person controlling them - it's a question of reaction speed.<br />
<br />
Take 4 elemental shamans, put them all on vent and have them focus fire a target. Keep in mind approx. 100-200ms latency to the WoW server for each person, in addition to Ventrilo latency and finally add the time it takes for them to hear the target being called, target it and then start casting a lightning.<br />
<br />
With a quad-box, you basically get rid of all those extra factors meaning, again, they will ALL hit the SAME target at the SAME time. On my warrior with 399 resil and 12.5K HP an elemental shaman with bloodlust / heroism is one of the most dreaded enemies. 4 elemental shaman would kill me without a chance for a spell reflect seeing as all 4 chain lightnings is plenty to take me from 100 to 0. Even if those 4 don't kill me, the consequent shocks / lightning bolts will kill me. For a quad-box of shamans it would take about 5 seconds to kill a warrior or pretty much any target for that reason (unless it's a mage or a paladin preemptively blocking / bubbling).<br />
<br />
Basic point I am trying to make is that multi-boxing is akin to cheating by cutting out human factor.<br />
<br />
PvE is another story - I could care less for what/when/how someone kills a boss.</div></div><hr />

Please 150 dollars a month? I can make more than that in a day easy working. All you kids saying he is so rich really need to get full time jobs instead of living off your parents, or just working 20 hours a week at best.<br />
<br />
You would be suprised how much money you have if you work 40+ hours a week. Sure you work alot but you also have alot of money so you can actually do fun stuff. Like 10 box kara. Or, Go get plastard in vegas. I have done #2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes its a easy instance to do, this is because the everyones gear has improved and they quite frankly outgear it. I remember doing it in greens / blues and it was a nice instance - So because its a easy instance that PuGs clear 24/7, does that make it easy to 10-box? there are 5 boxers that team up with 5 boxers to try take down karazhan and none of them have gotten as far as this guy. The challenge and fun that comes with learning the tactics on your own, imho that will outlive any enjoyment you can possibily get from any game on the market. <br />
<br />
There was also a reply from someone saying if they was 'rich' they wouldnt be spending money on WoW - you would not give a shit about £89 leaving your bankaccount every month :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except you missed the point. 4 characters with 0 latency between them is not the same as 4 human characters with all those extra factors counted in. I've fought quad-ele shaman teams before and pretty much all of them suffered the same problem - they did not react fast enough to changing environment. They would need to play a ton of games together to adjust to each other's playstyle and to develop their own twitch reaction, however with a quad-box of 4 ele shamans there is no overhead, 10K+ damage comes in at the same time and hits the same target.</div></div><hr />

If I saw 4 shamans coming at me (even if they WERENT dual-boxed) I don't think I would have any reason to not be in D stance with a shield on. It doesn't matter about the reaction times or any of that, what I meant was why would you set yourself up to get one shot.</div></div><hr />

Ever heard of tremor totem?</div></div><hr />

Wrath of Air totem(s). <br />
Magma totem(s). (for melee attackers to enjoy)<br />
Healing/Mana stream totem(s).<br />
...<br />
Lightning bolt.<br />
Chain lightning.<br />
Earth shocks... for spell interrupts/dmg and for instant dmg for melee attackers.<br />
Frost shocks... for slow effect/dmg.<br />
<br />
<br />
5 of anything is evil to have to face down... especially 5 ranged classes vs anything.<br />
I've seen 5 box locks, hunters, and mages. But the fact that Sham's have so many utilities built in already, having 5 of them operating in sync with one another is literally shock and awe.</div></div><hr />

http://www.dual-boxing.com/forums/index.php?page=Index will answer all your questions there is quite a few programs that transfer your keys to the other wow clients keyclone you pay for once, octopus is free and requires a little more setting up. once you have the addons on the alts and the macro's set up its actually quite easy to play</div></div><hr />
