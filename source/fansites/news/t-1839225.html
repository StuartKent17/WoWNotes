Dev Interviews<br />
BlizzPlanet (http://warcraft.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/gamescom-2015-legion-interview-with-tom-chilton-ion-hazzikostas) had the chance to talk to the developers about Legion. New information that wasn't in other interviews is below:<br />
<br />
<br />
There won't be another filler patch between Warlords and the Legion invasion, other than the flying patch.<br />
Ruby Sanctum didn't work out well. It was entertaining for a week or so, as there was one boss to kill and then you were done. <br />
In Warlords, the team didn't do enough to express the story through in-game content. The garrison campaign wasn't enough. <br />
One more character slot is being added.<br />
Having one artifact per spec will help to focus the specs. Right now Frost Death Knights can use a two-hand weapon or dual wield, but their artifact is two runeblades, so they will focus on dual-wielding in Legion and Unholy will focus on two-hand weapons.<br />
The new Honor system allows for some new abilities to be added that would have been cut in the past, as they were PvP only.<br />
Draenor's forces are busy rebuilding Draenor, so they are not going to come and help with the Burning Legion.<br />
Illidan's storyline will span the entire expansion.<br />
Only allowing elves to be Demon Hunters fits the lore and is the right choice for Legion.<br />
One of the social features under development is notifying you when friends join a queue and allowing you to queue with them.<br />
The team would also like to improve communication across groups. If you have a group of friends you raid with or PvP with there should be a better way to communicate with them.<br />
Older time limited legendary items, such as the Mists of Pandaria cape, may become transmogable.<br />
The sewers of Dalaran were mention as an Order Hall for Rogues again.<br />
Champions will unlock or complement content rather than doing content for you.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Segus1992</div><div class="date">2015-08-09, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hopefully they make DW Frost more fun then, as it's currently very uninteresting in comparison to 2h Frost.<br />
<br />
Also, really? Sewers of Dalaran? When Rogues have places like Ravenholdt Manor, being one of the few classes with an already established class hall, they give them a new one in the literal *sewers* of Dalaran? Damn, I guess they truly don't care about Rogues.</div></div><hr />

But you were quicker than me. :P But yeah, I agree! Ravenholdt Manor is much more fitting than some sewers in Dalaran. Please Blizzard!</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't mind crucifying the lore, when it suits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep in mind Ravenholdt is not open to all rogues lore wise and i would it prefer it remain that way, The sewers could be really cool id blizzard implements it like a secret section full of awesome stuff, 90s RPG style.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AdamJariko</div><div class="date">2015-08-09, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ravenholdt was destroyed in lore by Wrathion. Can't really go there.</div></div><hr />

One of those ares should be an aren't for this sentence to make sense. Presumably the second one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frost in general needs something. Though with a focus on DW, it could just become the &quot;fast&quot; (i.e. cooldown limited rather than resource limited) spec. Plus DW degrades into a 2 button spec when AoE comes into play...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vegas82</div><div class="date">2015-08-09, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If Frost is to be DW only, then they need to make it how it was back during Cata.<br />
<br />
They've made it sound like there will be major overhauls for some specs. Maybe frost is one of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have stated previously that it will be Achievement based again, and Survival IS melee. Though most people think that BM would make more sense as melee, even considering that Surv was melee in Vanilla.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Best feature would be a dressing tab for tabards and transmog items. Similar to how heirlooms work.<br />
<br />
The transmog UI has been stated as being moved to that. Whether it's in a later, unplanned, patch (Dance Studio) or dropped is yet to be seen.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tpedro</div><div class="date">2015-08-09, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am pretty sure that implementing the transmog/tabard tab would make players happier than any other new expansion features.<br />
And that is pretty sad imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How would people who still don't believe it believe it more after this interview? They've said it in other interviews..</div></div><hr />

<br />
When did that happen? I see that Wrathion took over Ravenholdt in Cata, which could be why it's been precluded as the Rogue Order Hall, on Wowpedia, but there's nothing about it being destroyed...<br />
<br />
As for the Sewers of Dalaran being the Rogue Order Hall, it makes sense in a way. Dalaran is mobile, which is perfect for Rogues, and if the Kirin Tor doesn't mind the Rogues being there, it makes it the perfect base of operations. Dalaran will likely have stay neutral after this, though (Sorry Alliance fans. :( ).<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Draenor's forces are busy rebuilding Draenor, so they are going to come and help with the Burning Legion.&quot;<br />
<br />
wat?<br />
<br />
<br />
They're going to be apart of the Army of Light. Despite WoD's failings, I don't see Blizzard outright abandoning Draenor or its denizens. We may even go to Goria one day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's...the servers are going to be ghost towns. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And Dalaran Sewers for rogues...fuck you, devs. Ravenholdt. It's in the fucking game already. Or are you just going to abandon it like everything else?</div></div><hr />

Because his whole little whine fest was specifically about demon hunters only being night elves and blood elves. <br />
<br />
Also it's their fucking lore, so they can't crucify the lore cause the lore is whatever the fuck they decide it is.</div></div><hr />

Did you not watch the teaser cinematic that shows Gul'dan resurrecting him? Maiev Shadowsong took his body back to her prison to make sure no one tried to do that, but Gul'dan did somehow. I'm sure we'll know more in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope this can be disabled; it sounds like it could really be annoying. It's one of the first things I turn off when I install Steam. I don't want to be spammed with Steam popups every time a friend comes online or starts playing a game. Besides, sometimes I just want to be left alone and play the game by myself and if my friends want me to join their queue I figure they'll ask me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's be honest - they control the trickle of info, and they don't have much more to announce yet. I wouldn't expect anything substantial until the beta, honestly. Stockton seemed like he was holding back on the professions question, I'm sure they're mid-development and aren't going to go in depth until it's done. <br />

The only thing that would make sense is if they're playing semantical games again, they have a &quot;content&quot; patch for WoD, not a 'filler' patch, and they're not ready to announce it yet. <br />
<br />
If 6.2 is it for WoD, that's bad. There's no way this expansion is coming in less than 6-8 months, not if it's going to be fully tested and not rushed.</div></div><hr />

I think it's obvious, whoever is in charge of PR and community relations at Blizzard has decided that the only way the devs will talk now is on third party sites, Blizzcon, and events like this. No forums, no player questions, no Reddit questions, just scripted, controlled, contained dribbles of information, and carefully cherry picked questions on Twitter.<br />
<br />
Why? Who knows, that's internal Blizzard stuff, and they don't talk. Maybe the devs and other employees were letting the player comments get to them, and they were wasting too much time blowing up over insults and criticisms, and debating things like flying, so a higher up said &quot;enough&quot;, and told them to knock it off, shut down most lines of communication so as not to distract the devs in their shiny ivory tower. <br />
<br />
Or, maybe they just don't care anymore. It's just a job, and you buy it or don't, they don't really care, they're watching for opportunities to jump onto the Overwatch team anyway.<br />
<br />
Who knows? <br />
<br />
It's up to you to decide if this is a company you want to give you money to. If you feel that you can play the game without developer interaction, you're good to go. Otherwise, you're not going to be happy. Or unsub, and move on. <br />
<br />
I made my choice based on the actual gameplay. Watching the devs flail around in mudpuddles they created themselves has been the best free entertainment all year.</div></div><hr />

Realllly lame, if you ask me. All of this resurrecting old villians from past expansions is just plain lazy story telling. It was okay the first dozen times, but now it's getting played out.

After defeating him, you click on his body and his portrait says, &quot;Dead&quot;. It doesn't say, &quot;Knocked out cold.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that it was very clear to 99% of the player base that he dies in his battle with us atop The Black Temple. Unless there's some EU lore out there written in a book or something that says otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lore wise it's the only thing that makes sense, these are the demon hunters that were with illidan, do you remember fighting any gnome or worgen demon hunters? plus with the fact they can double jump and elves are only ones with two jump animations, they aren't going to go through and give every other race a 2nd jump animation for something that wouldn't even make sense.

Yes, yes, I have heard all of this before, and I agree with none of it, other than I ofc know that it takes time to create custom models for more races...but that was not my question.

Well Illidan did consume the skull of the MU Guldan, so maybe he found him because of that. Maiev is pretty horrible as a jailor. Tyrande was able to get Illidan out before without too much trouble, I'm sure Guldan wouldn't have any problems either.</div></div><hr />

Right now there are four tiers of raid difficulty, and the hardest raid tier is only accessible if you run with 20 people. I personally want them to get rid of a raid tier, perhaps even LFR, and go back to the model they used during Wrath, Cata, and Mists with the option of doing a 25 or 10 on normal and heroic, allowing people to engage in the hardest raiding difficulties in different ways depending on the size of their guild and who they wanted to play with. I would also like to see them implement more features to foster community and guild. I was hoping for guild garrisons, but it looks like that isn't going to happen. I hope they don't drop the ball again like they did in Warlords.</div></div><hr />

Interested why you liked 2H more than DW. Is the rotation you liked better? The high damage obliterates? Because i am sure that since you will not be able to use 2H they will also tune the rotation and make all abilities usefull, including Obliterate.

You have no idea how much happiness this brings me. During ToC and Early ICC i was tanking on my dk as DW Frost. Best part for me was almost everyone at start said &quot;why dw tanking lol noob&quot; then when i took like 1/2 the damage of other dk tanks ppl were like &quot;wow didnt except that&quot; <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tankbug</div><div class="date">2015-08-09, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, found the answer I was looking for: <br />
<br />
Ion Hazzikostas:<br />
<br />
In Legion, certainly only elven races will be Demon hunters, part of it is, you aren’t just any demon hunter in general, you are a lead member of the Illidari, specifically the Demon Hunters that were in Illidan’s service at the Black Temple that you saw back in Outland, and that’s where your story begins.<br />
<br />
Everything about Demon hunters as we’ve seen them and further described in Warcraft Lore, focuses on these two races, and that’s what makes sense for the story that we are telling.<br />
<br />
So I think also that when players have been excited about playing a demon hunter when they were asking us for years, if we do them as a hero class, the fantasy of the demon hunter — what immediately comes to mind, is Illidan or the associated Blood Elves we saw in Burning Crusade. I don’t think anyone has this picture of a dwarven demon hunter in their heads. So I think that’s what we are focusing on and I think it’s the right choice for Legion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, that's good news and bad news. I won't play a DH in Legion, but perhaps I can create one in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I did this too, for dungeons. Because a Frost focused spec was in every way inferior to Blood for defensive purposes. A split build could potentially have been better than pure Blood (such as the one I played), but that was 2-handed. Dual wield Frost was NOT better or even as good as Blood for tanking.<br />
<br />
That said, if they make dual wield Frost a cool DPS spec, I don't mind the change.<br />

If they would have just said &quot;Legion 45 min Recap&quot; everyone would have not cared, and not wasted their time for it. They said Q &amp; A and we thought Real Q &amp; A.<br />

Fixed that for you.<br />
<br />
And yes, I agree with you. I really wonder what went on in their heads when they decided this was a good idea.</div></div><hr />

Well I can't speak for him, but for me the answers are yes and yes. The 2H rotation is more logical. Spamming Howling Blast and Plague Strike feels crappy. Sure, you could use Obliterate, but there's no point. They tried to fix it then immediately reverted the fix instead of adjusting Might of the Frozen Wastes or something.<br />

That and frankly I just like the look of two-handed weapons better, and I think Unholy's pet-based play is obnoxious, and now it's the only option after both DPS Blood and 2H Frost are effectively removed.

I see... thanks for answering...i also like a the 2h rotation more but on the other hand i like the look and animations of dw :) i think that since there will not be a 2h frost, they will fit obliterate into rotation for sure..it wont gonna be just howling blast, plague strike and frost strike...<br />

Maybe the artifact talents we will chose will play a role as to what rotation we chose to play..</div></div><hr />

Not really your fault when it conflicts with everything else they'd set themselves up for.<br />
<br />
We had the opening a while back saying Sunday would be answering questions.<br />
The very fact it was labeled as a Q&amp;A.<br />
Celestalon asking for questions on twitter.<br />
A recent tweet from @Warcraft saying that we'd be learning more.<br />
<br />
Then what we got was a cosplay and dance show with little to no new information and all of the questions sounding very empty and scripted, though the script was apparently poor enough that they let someone saying horde paladins were in classic.<br />

Hell, the fact they had the lead developers up on a panel alone sets expectations.</div></div><hr />

There they go lawyer-speaking us with the &quot;we didn't promise that&quot; phrase. I swear that is their excuse for everything. They &quot;genuinely&quot; said they will be hosting a live Q&amp;A on Sunday.<br />
<br />
Yep they tend to do that a lot. They'll say x y z thing/change will be in the game. Then when they don't do it or they just pull it, they say well we didn't promise. It's ridiculous.<br />
<br />
The players are the customers. In adult life or in business, if someone says they are going to do it the other person expects that the other person will do it. It is irrelevant if they didn't use the word promise, or pinky swear, or swear on a stack of bibles, or had fingers crossed, or whatever elementary school excuse they try to use to get out of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We had the opening a while back saying Sunday would be answering questions.<br />
The very fact it was labeled as a Q&amp;A.<br />
Celestalon asking for questions on twitter.<br />
A recent tweet from @Warcraft saying that we'd be learning more.<br />
<br />
Then what we got was a cosplay and dance show with little to no new information and all of the questions sounding very empty and scripted, though the script was apparently poor enough that they let someone saying horde paladins were in classic.<br />
<br />
Seems like they changed their minds last minute and didn't have time to change the schedule, but rather just panicked and made it seem like a Q&amp;A when in fact it wasn't one. That's poor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2015 Q3 sub number 2.5-3M<br />
<br />
2015 Q4 sub number 1.5-2M<br />
<br />
2016 Q1 (before legion's release) sub number 500K-1M<br />
<br />
2016 after legion release, sub number increases to 2M<br />
<br />
Ever since sub number will stay around 1M<br />
<br />
Blizzard announces legion as the final expansion of WoW, this game will end in some time around 2017, they probably will give Segras a proper ending but this game will be over once for all.<br />
I really hope for it. WoD in my eyes is a disaster. I want my Demon Hunter asap. The sooner their subs sink the sooner I will get my new shiny class. Well new expansion is going to be about legion and elves so it is right by me. Until then sink, bitch, sink, to the bottom with you!</div></div><hr />

they do deserve it for the attitude they have - lets hope all of devs responsible for the WoD disaster will be fired asap cause they fucking deserve it for runining this game. to keep loosing 1 mln sub a month and not doing anything deserve geting lynched.</div></div><hr />

lower subs mean anything but longer dev time - it mainly means lower income so cuting stuff out of game untill it become empty shell.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's damning at all nor did I ever see them &quot;promise&quot; anything even in that blue post. Not that I think they have to say &quot;We promise...&quot; (though I think they ought to start since everyone and their mother sees a blue post as a promise even when RL happens and things need to be changed/removed/adjusted), but, to me, it was clearly just an announcement of their future plans at Gamescom and people decided to take it as &quot;yes! they can answer every question form every forum and every tweet!&quot; And when they inevitably don't (I still see topics and posts about DH's using rogue weapons or how they're pissed we're in AU again - answered in the Q/A) people get so angry and become knobs. People had a lot of questions right after the announcement (rightly so) and while they obviously didn't answer all the important ones some people wanted - based on the backlash - it's hardly fair to garner this reaction, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I didn't know about profession quests so that was something answered for me. I'm glad they're going to try and revamp that part of the game. I got something out of this little stream and that's all I took it for: once I saw at as 90% recap, I was like &quot;meh, they'll have more at Blizzcon in 3 months&quot;. Or is this Q&amp;A just an outlet for people upset about the no flying at the start of the expansion again?</div></div><hr />

I hate to say it like this but this is the norm here at MMOChampion. People will take the smallest, most insignificant thing and say &quot;this is the worst thing ever, wow is dead&quot; and then it enters the echo chamber and makes a very very minor thing into something major. Personally I would rather not see a site admin throw fuel to the fire like this especially considering that MMOChampion is probably the best example today of an unpleasable fanbase today. <br />
<br />
We are still months away from Legion and considering the disaster last time about cutting features did people honestly expect them to announce new system functions this far out only to have to strip them away which then will cause this echo chamber go nuts. Hell its already being done right now with that one island in the bottom right of the map.</div></div><hr />

They have needed, and continue to need, some better inter-dev communication as well as public speaking skills. These guys are programmers and developers...their lack of public presence and savvy speak is evident.<br />

exactly! I'm raiding with my guildies now out of attachement. and fffff, I miss playing with my buddies but they could not stand more than 1-2 months of it. they were all raiders, sure, but raiding alone won't keep all kinds of people. there was nothing to do outside. even im mop I remember joining dungeon runs just for the sake of fun and of course points. now, nope, there is really nothing to do. at least DH will provide me with some expansion long fun. transmogs, new sets to gather and mastering of class.</div></div><hr />

It was 900% cringeworthy.

Welcome to being a company, where advertising something and failing to deliver actually means more than a random layperson - it tarnishes your public image.<br />
