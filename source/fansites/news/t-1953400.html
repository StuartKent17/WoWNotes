Legion - Protection Paladin Flail Artifact Weapon<br />
The latest Legion build added a new artifact weapon variation that looks like it may belong to Protection Paladins. We took a look at how it may appear in game using the existing mace animations. As always, remember that this is just a rough preview, not a final release. <br />

[Feedback] Marksman Hunter<br />
I don't think this is quite intentional. Also, keep in mind that the higher frequency of Mark's after 1 cast greatly reduces the extra benefit on Trueshot, which currently increases the frequency of Mark application. <br />
<br />
Would be happy to see this frozen between 2-4 arcanes, with Trueshot dropping it to 1-2. Or whatever revamp you're working on regarding Marks and Trueshot. Is it possible these were tied to the duration of Vulnerable, so while the duration for it was low (prior build) so too were the numbers required to proc Mark? Thus, when the duration was tripled to 30s so were the value ranges on the Mark procs. If true, I don't like that at all - those outliers are far too wild. It's currently described as, &quot;Approximately 6 procs per minute.&quot; One way or another, 1-1-1-1-1 versus 16-1-11-2 and 1-12-14-13 are not good directions in my opinion. Maybe consider something to make the manipulation of Hunter's Mark more player controllable.<br />
<br />
edit; and a comment about explosive shot. You'll probably find most people will stand in melee range to simplify this into a click-click rather than a timed reactivation from range. Also I'm not sure 'slow moving' correctly describes 'crazy rocket'... <br />
(Warning, more under-the-hood techy talk, safe to ignore, not important to playing the game or performing well!)<br />
<br />
I appreciate the in-depth testing of this. Unfortunately, I think your testing method was missing that it's RPPM now, not a % chance. The count of shots between procs isn't relevant anymore, instead the time between procs is. And since you likely alternated between spamming a bunch of shots in a row (which you wouldn't do in practice due to wasting Focus) and stopping to take notes, you got wildly varying results. The proc rate is 6*Haste RPPM (with Unlucky Streak Prevention) now. With 20% Haste, this'll work out to about 1 proc every ~7.7 sec. The Unlucky Streak Prevention will start ramping up the proc rate after about 16sec, with no droughts of longer than 24sec.* With Vulnerable lasting 30sec, this will ensure 100% uptime is possible, with a ton of slush. A Mark every ~7.7sec on average will provide a reasonable frequency of Marked Shot usage as well.<br />
<br />
*16sec and 24sec are estimates based on my memory of the Unlucky Streak Prevention logic, which I don't have in front of me at this moment. Don't hang me if those are off by a bit!<br />
<br />
Regarding breaks for notes, this was per GCD. No gaps. So each one of those numbers represents the GCD of one spell: 1-1-15-3, for instance, would've been Arcane x1, Marked x1, Arcane x1, Marked x1, Arcane x15, Marked x1, Arcane x3, Marked x1. One hand for the button, one hand for writing the number. True enough, though, this would not account for gaps in time present from Aimed Shot cast times, so maybe that would affect things a bit. Yeah I sat there doing that, shush<br />
I've done similar things in the past. <br />
<br />
Yes, the Aimed Shots you're doing in-between (along with any other talented abilities on cooldowns, such as Head Shot, Barrage, or Explosive Shot, etc.) will fill time, which drastically affects things, cutting that 1-1-15-3 to actually 1-1-5-2 in practice, with that 5 being broken up by a couple other shots in between, thereby avoiding any long string of Arcane Shots.<br />
<br />
So the speculations about hunters mark being RPPM now were correct... Not happy about this. What if you got your proc on the boss right before a bunch of AoE fodder spawned, now you can't do your cleave because the RPPM timer has just started ramping up? RPPM is the worst kind of rng there is, it is uncontrollable and unpredictable. With 50% proc you at least could reasonably expect a proc after four arcane shots at most.<br />
This is a misunderstanding of how RPPM works. The only ramping proc chance is Unlucky Streak Prevention, which only kicks in if you've gotten a long string of bad luck, not normal gameplay. It's a time-based proc chance. RPPM is *more* consistent that a comparable simple % chance.<br />
<br />
Also, the &quot;before&quot; in Jademcian's data is not the 50% proc chance. That's the prior version, which was a much higher-overall ramping proc chance, when Vulnerability/Marked Shot was a previous design. A 50% proc chance is not &quot;four arcane shots at most&quot;; you'd commonly see way more failed procs in a row than that.

[Feedback] Holy Paladin<br />
Light of the Martyr's cost (mana) is currently higher than intended, which should be fixed in the next build. That should make the spell more attractive to start experimenting with and finding a role for in your playstyle. While a raw computation of net healing per mana will still make it appear below average, it will be much less so than it is now, and its other advantages should be more relevant: being a spammable instant, being able to focus higher throughput into one target, helping with mobility, synergizing with abilities such as Avenging Wrath, and the fact that self-damage varies in importance based on the situation.

[Feedback] Resto Shaman<br />
It's intended that healing from other totems doesn't add to Cloudburst Totem (as on live), and the tuning should reflect that. We'll add a short shared cooldown so you don't instantly recall the totem by accident.

CC with cast times( excluding sheep and fear), often don't get used, because it is often too late to use it. revert Shadowfury<br />
We haven't found that to be true at all. Why exclude Polymorph and Fear? They have cast time, and are used regularly. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/698342685543759872))<br />

Why was ranged autoattack (Shoot) removed from melee classes? Was great for flavour/RP, didn't affect PvE. Can we get it back?<br />

For Legion Brewmaster, will Haste reduce the recharge times of Ironskin and Purify in addition to increasing energy regen? Because I've seen that Haste is reducing recharge times on other tank AM abilities.<br />
Possibly; we're still deciding. Haste does give you more Tiger Palms, which give you more Brews, but that's relatively minor. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/698341145013653504))<br />

The solution is obvious... Ignore those who complain about the trivial details of a viable solution. Pretty sure the intended game audience is generally satisfied with medieval weaponry in the game. No one ever cared that swords, maces, and pikes have appeared in many games prior to WoW. Flails are just one more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
flails were always almost as dangerous to the user as the target in unskilled hands. when learning to use nunchuks on a hard target I once put my entire arm to sleep from the elbow down by not accounting for the rebound.</div></div><hr />

I just want swipe as a tool without a fucking CD, is this so much to ask for Blizz? Dang.<br />
<br />
Warriors and their CD on TClap, since forever, say hello. Stop complaining. The only valid complaint you can have about this is that tab targeting is so fucked that selected new streaming mobs is a nightmare without mindless AoE threat grabs.</div></div><hr />

That and using old models from Classic &amp; TBC, back when weapons looked like they were made of metal crafted by someone who knew what they were doing. &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't compare the two. And why should Droods be like Warriors? We had swipe for literally ever, since release of 1.0. No need to change a decent mechanic. Furthermore, just because Warriors have cd on Thunderclap this means Droods should have it as well on Swipe? Kinda strange, how does the Drood's cd-less swipe affect you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I realize this is kind of contradictory to the entire design and concept of the &quot;Artifacts&quot;....but you can transmog over them with whatever weapon/shield you want.<br />
<br />
No reason to blow off playing any specific spec or class just because you don't like the look of the &quot;Artifact&quot; itself when you can make it look like nearly anything in the game.</div></div><hr />
