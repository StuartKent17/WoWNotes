* Aura Mastery now lasts 6 sec. (Down from 10 sec)<br />
<br />
So, looks like it wasn't just holyprot pvp that was causing issues.<br />
<br />
Using LoH on yourself as a tank is a nice CD, gone. Sacred shield is a nice mitigation spell, nerfed to the ground (Exception: 25 mans)<br />
<br />
Was prot in PvE overpowered?</div></div><hr />

<br />
its only DATAMINED spell comparison, it could be a bug, a test, it could be only part of a bigger change (like adding a talent in prot that allows you to use it on yourself), etc.<br />
<br />
Wait to see what official patch notes will say in a few builds about it.<br />
<br />
As for AM, 10 second of insane resistance and no interrupt was ridiculous for PvE magic damage fights. I hope and assume they will compensate somewhere for these changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's just annoying. If the reason turns out to be &quot;Paladins were too good in PVP&quot;, I'll be sad. I mean... How the fucking hell can you not lay hands on yourself? <br />
<br />
It was also a pretty decent lifesaver in PvE, albeit not a necessary one. In almost every situation, I'd rather cast it on the healer than myself (As me getting low on health means the healer's either in trouble or OOM).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm FED UP of PvP ruining the core PVE game that is WoW. I'm fed up of the crying and puerile arguing from the PVP crowd that is, patch by patch, ripping this game apart. First they tore Warriors to shreds, then Deathknights, then Priests, then Rogues... now they remove the Paladins STAPLE FUCKING ABILITY because of the PvP game?<br />
<br />
Hear me out : I play WoW PVE, and yes, obviously my Paladin's a main. I also think it fucking STINKS that my game has to be affected by a small niche of WoW that I completely ignore.<br />
Once and for all, SEPARATE PvP from PvE. MAKE PVP only servers, stick to tournaments... better yet, make Arena PvP a pay-to-play service or something.<br />
<br />
OORRRRRRR, JUST REMOVE FUCKING ARENA FROM THE GAME. I don't swallow the developer's tripe of &quot;oooh, WoW is too complex and deep to balance bla bla bla&quot;<br />
<br />
What they mean to say is &quot;Competitive Arena PvP in WoW is too complex and deep to balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuck Arena. It's breaking the game. It's making the game less enjoyable to play.</div></div><hr />

Yes. Classes are flawed, and thus, should be refined (or redefined) based on the solid foundation of gly-- wait...<br />

<br />
Another Example: The Spirit of Redemption glyph in it's original form. (Gave a % change per heal to add X seconds to SoR's duration) In that form, Priests could possibly stay in SoR form indefinitely, and you know what can come from that.<br />

Yeah, we know who to blame the next time a Prot Pally's death leads to a wipe.<br />

I do however, concede to the point that it is a PvE nerf for specific fights like algalon - a nerf that probably isn't justified and as such should maybe be made up for somehow.</div></div><hr />

I'm FED UP of PvP ruining the core PVE game that is WoW. I'm fed up of the crying and puerile arguing from the PVP crowd that is, patch by patch, ripping this game apart. First they tore Warriors to shreds, then Deathknights, then Priests, then Rogues... now they remove the Paladins STAPLE FUCKING ABILITY because of the PvP game?<br />
<br />
Hear me out : I play WoW PVE, and yes, obviously my Paladin's a main. I also think it fucking STINKS that my game has to be affected by a small niche of WoW that I completely ignore.<br />
Once and for all, SEPARATE PvP from PvE. MAKE PVP only servers, stick to tournaments... better yet, make Arena PvP a pay-to-play service or something.<br />
<br />
OORRRRRRR, JUST REMOVE FUCKING ARENA FROM THE GAME. I don't swallow the developer's tripe of &quot;oooh, WoW is too complex and deep to balance bla bla bla&quot;<br />
<br />
What they mean to say is &quot;Competitive Arena PvP in WoW is too complex and deep to balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuck Arena. It's breaking the game. It's making the game less enjoyable to play.<br />
<br />
<br />
I liked the part where LoH was never usable in arena anyway, so arena essentially had zero impact on the change.<br />
<br />
But yeah, nice use of color and sizing to underline how overreactive you are about this.</div></div><hr />

A paladin Tank shouldn't need to rely on this as a -core- ability for tanking. They should focus on mitigation and keeping threat (which isn't hard). Leave it to the healers to be the healers, if everyone is doing their job right, then this issue is irrelevant. Not to mention, if by chance/luck you have a holy paladin healing the raid, you'll still have ONE LoH that will save a raid, It's like a druid and a BREZ. If you use it at the wrong time, it can screw up the raid completely or set you back somewhat... more strategic use of the LoH will be needed by the holy pally.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't work in arena to start with so no QQ from them about it.<br />

It works in BG's yay every 15/20 min u get a 2nd life, so basically once a bg. Not a game breaker...<br />

PvE it was a nice and one of the only 2 cd's a prot paladin has to trigger him/herself in o shit moments so again no reason for the change.<br />

Thanks for AGAIN nerfing PvE because of PvP.<br />
WoW is not a PvP game! You, Blizzard, have stated that many times. So quit ruining things for the PvE people because of this.<br />
LoH has been this way since release, what in the world makes it deserve a nerf now? Takes you 4 years to sit there and go, &quot;ok let's nerf it!&quot;<br />

<br />
That said.<br />
This nerf is hardly because of arena, because LoH isn't usable there.<br />
This nerf is hardly because of BG's, which incidentally do count as PvP and even more so with rated BG's, but LoH was only really an issue with prot paladin flag carriers and more of a nuisance than anything else. I'd like to see someone suggest a scenario where such a major change would be brought about because of BG imbalance.<br />
<br />
So, as far as the &quot;zomg pve nerfed cos of pvp&quot; cries go - there is no ground to stand on. <br />
<br />
The most likely scenario in my opinion is that Blizzard didn't like that prot paladins could go around soloing stuff left and right.</div></div><hr />

I have leveled up one before, up to 58. <br />
<br />
The other night, a group I was in needed a tank because our tank was d/c and he decided it would be better to switch over to his shaman to heal. I decided to switch my spec to prot from ret and found that LoH was a great save button when our shammy went OOM. <br />
<br />
As for pvp, yes, I can see that it can be a nuisance to fight a pally only for them to pop a LoH and replenish all their health but this should only truly be a problem if you are taking that pally on 1-on-1. Most of the time, that's not the case in BGs.</div></div><hr />

No. We still don't have a second cooldown. There is no excuse for this, period. It can't be used in arena. It is a reactionary oh shit button for holy and prot. The only excuse for this is not wanting people to use it in BGs. This is completely retarded<br />

Why is Lay on Hands nerfed? It shouldnt be PvE, considering it's more or less a &quot;Oh shit&quot; button for the player. It can't be Arena, as it can't be used(right?). Did the PvP moans and whines finally catch up? Or is it that OP for PvE?<br />

I never use LoH when soloing tbh, Even the SS nerf wont hit us that hard, Just means well have to use SoL not SoC when soloing, so just means it will last longer.<br />

<br />
LoH as a tank cooldown, hmm, tbh 'Ive been using it as a Mana regen for our healers, since in ToTc its rare if im that low its ever anything but an over heal, Algaron its a nice thing but else ways its...meh Its still kinda random and uneeded.</div></div><hr />

And i'm not going to touch the LoH nerf too much, because it's only in beta on the PTR, but for all the reason's that people have been sounding off on; i believe it has nothing to do with PvP, and has more to do with what all the Protadins have been saying.

<br />
<br />
and objectives are obviously balanced around a prot paladin and &lt;insert healer&gt; being able to hold their own vs. players simply by outlasting them? <br />
<br />
Take wsg - a prot paladin in decent gear can easily hold his own against quite a few even if his healer dies because of his damage reduction from gear and talents, his &quot;I'm dead oh wait back up to w/e % of HP it is&quot; and finally LoH. I've been quite frustrated countless times over having the healer and one or two dps rush in on us having had time to res and realize there was trouble in the flag room, at which point they pick us off and we start all over again. Now LoH might be on cooldown and we may have a chance if the resurrection timer aligns correctly with the healer going down and we get more than 20 seconds to take the paladin down 1.5? times<br />
<br />
Honestly, it just annoys me farming rep with Silverwing Sentinels because every time there's a prot paladin on the opposing team, it ends up being a 0-0 or 1-0 game after 25 minutes or a crushing defeat in 3 minutes if we didn't have a tank-specced player on our team. This rarely happens with any other class unless that player is ridiculously well-geared.<br />

and wtf r blizzard thinking with will of the forsaken?!?! i say that if they do that to the undead they have to do the same thing to Every man for Himself (which is WAY more OP then WotF), and escape artist (its only fair if they're &quot;balancing&quot; things). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Every man for himself SHARES the pvp trinket cooldown.<br />
<br />
so.<br />
no<br />
<br />
and i did actually lol irl when i read the LoH changes, im sure they will put some prot talent in or a glyph so you can use it on yourself.<br />
Anyway for whatever reasons paladins have been loling around for the last 1 year with their WOTLK talents, so ofc all the retadins are QQing and i will say this.<br />

<br />
lets see, if we go by blizzards logic to &quot;balance&quot; things, lets also take stealth away from rogues and cat form druids, sense humanoids and feign death from hunters, blink from mages, pets from all pet using classes (hunters, warlocks, unholy/dk, shadow/priest and frost/mage), stuns from warriors and rogues, dots and fears from warlocks and shadow priests, and eliminate plate from the game... maybe THEN the game will be &quot;balanced&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
You do realize that Every Man for Himself shares the full cooldown with a PvP trinket right?<br />
<br />
Or are you suggesting that every other trinket effect should be sharing a 45 second CD with it?<br />
<br />
I'm confused</div></div><hr />

The LOH nerf is made along the lines of being able to DI yourself, it just makes no sense. As people are saying, Paladins have &quot;two lives&quot; as things are now.

<br />
So lemme get this right. You take away a class defining ability so they cannot go back and do old content which blizzard has already stated they don't care about anyway. that's the worst theory i have EVER heard on thi ssubject. the funny part is that EVERYTHING a Prot Pally can solo i have done on my Ret Paladin and Warlock.

I wouldn't worry too much on the Lay on Hands change at this point. I don't want to promise we won't change the spell for 3.3, but our intent was to revert the others only change before it went out to the PTR, which is why we didn't patch note it.

<br />
# Infusion of Light now also reduces the cooldown on the effect of Sacred Shield by 12/24 sec.<br />
<br />
wouldn't change a thing. <br />
<br />
As for Prot Pallys / Ret Pallys solo'ing things, I'm afraid Blizzard won't put soloing content before PvP &quot;balancing&quot;.<br />

* Paladins will now receive a 2% increase to DPS for every cloth item worn. In addition, chance to crit will increase by 5% if a dress is worn. This is to encourage a wider variety of itemization for the Paladin.<br />
* Paladin can no longer target self with Lay on Hands as the spell was intended to help others.<br />

I hardly PvP and when I do, I break fear with 'zerker stance, not WotF. The only time I ever used it was breaking sneaky mindcontrolling priests or the occasional succubus.

What's the point of being undead anymore?<br />

The only other racial they had was cannibalism... that hardly seems equal compared to the increased axe expertise, or a free +1% hit, or a haste racial or...<br />

It's good to see that Blizzard was looking into the issue.<br />
<br />
As I stated earlier, I have a PTR pally, a level 58 pally and I'm going to start one up for role playing purposes and I'm an altoholic. I saw the self-LoH nerf as being something outrageous but I can't help but think that I could stand some changes to the current LoH:<br />
<br />
-First, revert Lay on Hands back to it's previous status of draining the paladin of all their mana when using the spell.<br />
-Second, remove the talent and the glyph that reduces the cooldown so that it stays at 20 min.<br />
-Third, in the Holy tree, with the removal of the cooldown reduction in Improved Lay on Hands, replace it with something like reducing the mana used by half (1 talent point) and 100% (2 talent points) and reduce the damage reduction buff from 10%/20% down to 5%/10%.<br />
<br />
That's only my idea, probably will not go over well, but hey, it's worth a shot.</div></div><hr />

I hope all pallies are not this stupid. My main isnt a pally, even so I KNOW well infusion of light is a deep HOLY talent. The sacred shield nerf is to make ret pally less tanky, while holy is untouched. If there is holy pally in raid (what raid has no holy pally nowadays!?), sacred shield is put on the tanks 100% time, so this isnt much of a nerf for prot pally in pve either. <br />
<br />
And if you count roughly each tank class has 2 major tanking cooldowns, while prot palles has got used to LoH as a tank cd for a while, you ll see this is a nerf for PvE pallies. They revereted the change in local PTR build, but LoH will be touched in the future in another nerf/fix.</div></div><hr />

I hate to sound like a total noob and I can probably blame this on the fact that I don't have a pally at 80, but I don't think I am using Sacred Shield as often as I should be. But from the looks of it, the way you explained it makes the nerf seem not so bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I hate people posting when they don't know anything about their class or what they are doing... if you don't have 80 lvl paladin, you can't be using fuckin' Sacred Shield because you don't have fuckin' Sacred Shield. Paladins get it at lvl 80.<br />
<br />
Now to the busines..<br />
<br />
True, Sacred shield &quot;nerf&quot; for holy palas isn't bad as individual. Though.. in the raid you cannot place it on each tank so prots should still have their own.<br />
<br />
And nerfing ret palas survival... Only things they have is LoH, SS, Bubble and self heals (which cannot be done so much with rets mana pool). If the nerf on self-LoH comes on top of SS nerf.. ret palas in PvP are goners. As you bubble on bg there is always a warrior who'll take a way your bubble. Boom - it's shattered.<br />
<br />
What comes to self-LoH.. BULLSHIT! <br />
<br />
By the way I'd like to hear how Blizzard would explain that to RP realms.. &quot;Palas cannot lay hands on themselves because.... uh.... they are afraid they have the golden hand of midas and would be turned in to gold? &quot;<br />
<br />
In PvE.. as holy paladin self-LoH.. it's sometimes nice to use it on yourself - not only because of mana. AoE damage can be pretty nasty and you need to heal others too than just tank and yourself. So I sometimes &quot;have to&quot; use it on myself.<br />
<br />
as ret pally.. I've many times saved myself with LoH if healers has been too busy to heal me in a tight situation. I read every comment posted on this subject and had tons of ideas to talk about but can't really remember more than this. Guess this was already a bit too much? ;)</div></div><hr />

Either way though, i use Lay on Hands in the event healers are out of range/wondering why fire is hurting their character.<br />

Might be troubling though in those rare situations where you may encounter a soloable old boss that uses a skill to catch you off guard i suppose, and you need a jolt of healthy goodness.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Ouch&quot; is right, Bouboille. Those wings are like... toes. They're toe wings. Coming out of her lower back.<br />

If the wings were raised and her hat was shrunk like about an infinity of times so that it didn't make her look like a 2 foot tall toe-winged bat fairy with a mardi-gras mask intended for the incredible Hulk resting precariously on her head (without breaking her neck which, now that I mention it, doesn't fricking exist) then yes, she'd be amazing.<br />

<br />
It can possibly be PVE based.<br />
It's highely likely they started internal testing of Arthas, or some other boss, and like we saw in recent developments, they may need to nerf a single ability that can triviliaze the fight.<br />
<br />
Imagine Arthas having an ability called &quot;I'll Bitchslap You Silly&quot; where he backhands the tank on the cheek, and the slap is so loud the entire raid is deafened and silenced and the tank is brought to 1 HP. Healers can't heal, the tank has to survive someone (moving out of the way or whatever), but pop the Prot Pala pops LoH.<br />
It's an absurd scenario, but it could be possible. It happened with Anub.</div></div><hr />

Doubtful. Because in 25 ICC there will be always more then one paladin and swoosh, the trick is still possible. This would make 25 easier than 10? Never again!<br />
It makes more sense that its related to Improved Lay on Hands being to powerful and devs thinking to complicated to just change this. (I say &quot;more sense&quot; in contrast to the quoted reason)</div></div><hr />

The LoH nerf is pretty unexpected, but neither is a nerf to holy..SS nerf is to stop prots &amp; rets getting so many shields, and as holy you generally use LoH on other people<br />

It's not only hurting prots. It hurts the usability of paladins as a whole. A class is not only good for a group/raid because it can buff and heal everyone but also if it can take care of itself by healing itself and take some load from the healers.<br />
Blizzard stated soo often that paladins are a defensive class and now they are nerfing 2/3 of their major defensive tools? Yeah, we still have our bubble..wonder for how long.<br />
I don't know and don't care pretty much how this effects pvp..but it hurts pve much.<br />
Especially one of the funniest parts of being a paladin: soloing older content with ease.<br />
I'm still voting for more seperation of pvp and pve mechanics (uh like pet avoidance maybe? don't tell me it's impossible or hard to understand for players)</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't worry too much on the Lay on Hands change at this point. I don't want to promise we won't change the spell for 3.3, but our intent was to revert the others only change before it went out to the PTR, which is why we didn't patch note it. We have already changed it back on our local builds. <br />

It doesn't affect me really as I play holy. But still, if they want to eliminate prot healing, why not remove the increased heal on critical effect? That'd sort alot and it hasn't got any use for Prot paladins.<br />
<br />
Would be nice aswell to see the mana return lower to prot holy from avoidance somehow. But I think this will effect PvE too much so they won't take action.</div></div><hr />

thats prob why we have not seen shammy t 10 they want us to look extra nice for are start as kings of wow<br />
<br />
<br />
although that will never happen....... :'( :'( :'( :'( :'(<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe not kings of wow, but in some way its a special treat to us. At the moment i'm glad i changed from enhancement to elemantal though enhancement is a lot of fun to play. But in PvE damage i'm better of with elemental skill. At least it works better for me.<br />
If the T10 eleshaman-set stays like that i am really looking forward to get my hands on it :)<br />

<br />
I wouldn't worry too much on the Lay on Hands change at this point. I don't want to promise we won't change the spell for 3.3, but our intent was to revert the others only change before it went out to the PTR, which is why we didn't patch note it. We have already changed it back on our local builds.<br />
<br />
The paladin class isn't just supposed to be for support anymore, but at the same time, the original intent for many paladin abilities was to help the group. Over time however they have contributed into making the paladin into a &quot;one-man army,&quot; able to play offensively, defensively and heal without say the stance changing or shapeshifting or sometimes event talent specialization required of other classes. Many of the LK balance problems we've had with the class are because of that core issue.<br />
<br />
With that said, we're just not sure a Lay on Hands change really accomplishes much from a balance perspective, while it feels bad to lose such an iconic ability. We just don't think the bang for the buck is there on this change, which is why we reverted it. But I'm not going to promise we won't touch it.<br />
<br />
In fact, I'm not going to promise anything with this post. :) Please don't dredge it up later to try and argue against any upcoming changes. I'm just trying to clear up some confusion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To clarify that I am not a Paladin hater. I have been playing Paladin since before Molten Core was out as a raid instance. I have plenty of experience with the Paladin class and have dealt with all the bull of the class and Blizzard's changes for 5+ years now.<br />
<br />
With that said.. these are not PvE nerfs.<br />
With that said... stop crying.<br />
<br />
If you don't understand...<br />
Lay on Hands;<br />
There isn't a single PvE encounter in the game based around the use of LoH. While this might be a loss of a cooldown for a Prot Pally, it doesn't affect in the slightest what Holy Paladins and Ret Paladins should be using LoH in PvE for. If you're a Holy or Ret Paladin and you're taking so much damage that you need the use of LoH to save yourself... Well then there's something clearly wrong with what you're doing and you should probably do something to fix it.<br />
<br />
Sacred Shield;<br />
Protection Paladins and every other tank might not be balanced to reduce the same ammount of damage but regardless of that point every tank is designed to be able to tank an encounter without the use of Sacred Shield.<br />
In a 10 man you do not need Sacred Shield to kill a boss. If you do a 10 man without Sacred Shield, which will happen in a lot of pugs due to the fact that most Paladin players aren't very smart (let's be honest), you are not in any way handicapped. In 25 mans you should most likely have a Holy Paladin which if you payed any attention to the change to Infusion of Light... SACRED SHIELD STILL WORKS THE EXACT SAME WAY FOR HOLY PALADINS - WHO BY THE WAY HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL SACRED SHIELD OUT OF THE 3 PALADIN SPECS.<br />
<br />
Lay on Hands nerf doesn't affect arenas in the slightest since it wasn't usable before.<br />
Sacred Shield slightly nerfs the group utility of comps that use a Ret or Prot/Ret Pally which don't depend on Sacred Shield anyhow.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell you're crying for no reason... accept the change and realize that it might do some good, because as soon as all the easy-to-use-faceroll aspect of the Paladin class is gone, we might get some great abilities or ability-combos that require a little bit of skill to use.. and that is when the people who genuinely want to play the class rather than be FOTM can actually rejoice at the fact that Paladins are no longer the easy-mode class that any noob can pick to get into the game.<br />
<br />
TLDR? Well here you go-<br />
<br />
Holy stays the same.<br />
<br />
It's not a Holy PvE nerf.<br />
It's not a Holy PvP nerf.<br />
<br />
It slightly hurts PvE Prot.<br />
<br />
PvE Ret isn't affected in the least unless you're incompetent and need to LoH yourself.<br />
PvP Ret and PvP Prot/Ret don't depend on either of these abilities so QQ MOAR.<br />
<br />
10 mans are easy these nerfs don't hurt whatsoever.<br />
10 man heroics are designed for you to actually think about who and what you're bringing.<br />
<br />
25 mans: You should have a Holy Pally in just about any raid so wipe your tears and think about wether or not you really need to be crying next time.<br />
<br />
Nerfs to faceroll abilities may one day bring buffs for skilled players, have faith!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I highly doubt they will remove this ability from pallis using it on themselves,however i have feeling that blizz will end up removing it from pvp,when i say pvp i am talking about bg's and arena's,world pvp is random and cannot be labled as imba.<br />
<br />
LoH in bg's is imba because it's supposed to be 10 vs. 10,15 vs. 15,etc. not 11 vs. 10 or 16 vs.15<br />
LoH in arena is just as bad or worse.<br />
Could you imagine having a battle rez or reincarnate option for arena?? well LoH is basically the same as those 2.<br />
<br />
Speaking of reincarnate,shamans prepare yourself losing it as a ability in bg's,if they do it to palli's i see no reason they wont do it to you.<br />
<br />
But this is all speculation,so relax and play the game to have fun.It's not supposed to be something to make you miserable and make you come to near tears when your beloved class is nerfed or not given something at all.<br />
<br />
Just because they say it cant be cast on yourself doesnt mean thats it.Who knows,they may have more changes in store for it where if you do cast it on someone you also will benefit from the spell in some way,Blizz may not reveal it yet because they want to test it first to make sure they arent making something worse by trying to make it better. ;)</div></div><hr />

80% Playerbase: Ooohhhhh Paladin nerfs yippeee. Now I don't have to kill them 3 times in BGs and Wintergrasp.<br />
<br />
Paladins: Oh noes a nerf. Cry, cry, winge, moan, emo, /wrist etc.<br />
<br />
80% Playerbase: Om nom nom nom Paladin tears are tasty.<br />
<br />
Blizzard: Wait, you know what that nerf to LoH wasn't really needed and we've taken it away now. We just wanted to see how you guys would react should we ever need to nerf some thing big. So we decided to test it on something of yours you only use in BGs, world PvP and tanking if you manage to die twice in less than 2 minutes. We're very, very sorry Paladins here have a tissue, to make you feel better we'll lessen the other nerfs on you when the other classes aren't looking, probably when Shaman t10 gets released. You know we've been holding it back all this time just incase this happened. We love you Paladins.<br />
<br />
Paladins. *sniffle* Really? You scared us for a moment there Blizzard. You've given us all this love of late and then we get a couple of minor nerfs...... That was a really mean trick to play.<br />

Paladin: Oh yes plox, oh and one more thing. Could you make a tier set that we look good in?<br />

<br />
this is really kinda devastating for our guild mt tho. lay on hands was a lifesaver when the healers were down and getting b rezd. he'd blow some cds as they go down and when hes almost dead pops loh boom full 55k health. parries and blocks enough to last till heals are up and making big pretty green numbers again.<br />
<br />
on a more exciting note TAKE THAT YOU DIRTY UNDEAD ROGUES!!! no more auto breaking 2 of my fears then cloaking as i have enough dots on you to do any damage. you cloak when i want you to cloak.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind him bubbling and then healing, but after that and I think I've finally killed him - bam, casts Lay on Hands, back at full health. This is in Battlegrounds of course.<br />
<br />
It's a stupid spell that was overpowered for a long time. Props to Blizz for finally having the balls to do this.</div></div><hr />

so they are doing this not because they care for u, but just because they want to boost their new crap &quot;race change&quot; service.<br />
so cheap ....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bubbling+healing is enough for Paladins. It's unfair for them to have three lives in a Battleground.<br />
<br />
But I do think LoH should be self-castable through a talent in Holy, like others said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is an insane nerf for our lvl 80 spell. Now if you don't have Infusion of Light (reduces the cooldown on the effect of Sacred Shield by 12/24 sec) it's a total waste of mana.</div></div><hr />

I understand that Blizz Nurfs classes that have a larger player base than the rest.. but.. they needed to Nurf Retadin really.. get rid of all the /cast random noobs.<br />
I would of thought if they really wanted to Nurf Ret paladins in PVP. Make LoH unusable in BG?<br />
And also i agree with the self-castable talent in Holy.</div></div><hr />
