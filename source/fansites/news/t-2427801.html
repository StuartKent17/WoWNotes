Rift's advertising slogan back then was &quot;We're not in Azeroth anymore&quot;.<br />

Nowadays you want to be anywhere but Telara. :)<br />

<br />
Everyone called bloody everything a wow killer and if it didn't then it was a bad game....<br />
<br />
People are idiots.<br />
<br />
Loads of great MMOs outside of WoW and sadly there are people with this &quot;WoW is the only MMO and fuck everything else&quot; mentality.<br />

Are there any of the other so-called &quot;WoW killers&quot; still up and running other than TOR now?<br />
<br />
FF14, GW2, ESO and a few others.<br />
<br />
But this whole &quot;wow killer&quot; shit is silly. As I said. Plenty of great games outside of WoW and have a healthy population.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was actually a cracking game at the start.<br />
<br />
NMT is when it went to shit. Devs started going full on cash grab with crap like putting a gear slot behind a paywall or heavy ingame grind.<br />
<br />
Recent expansion they just gave up in favour of a progression server which ironically tanked.</div></div><hr />

Still a sad news. Wildstar had some great art and gameplay. Even if the thing was a mess.</div></div><hr />

FF14 sort of slipped under the radar because it failed so bad on its initial release. When they shut it down and re-did the whole game, it had a gradual uphill climb to gain any sort of popularity. People knew it was a total shit game in beta though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rift and ESO are the two I know of. I remember when Rift first aired the launch commercial which stated &quot;We are not in Azeroth Anymore&quot;. The first commercial of a game is &quot;Hey were the one's who are killing wow&quot; doesn't hype people up it seems. The gameplay actually was fun at first though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair it got very popular on it's relaunch. 14 million lifetime players in 5 years isn't half bad.<br />
<br />
1.0 was absolute trash though I agree.</div></div><hr />

I tried it again this summer because i was bored of wow and wanted something to fill the void for a couple weeks, and i could barely get past the starting area. <br />
<br />
I will say one of the best things about wildstar, was the double jump. Love that WoW put it in for DH.</div></div><hr />

Dude shut up with this mentality already.<br />
<br />
I don't mean it maliciously towards you but every time someone proclaims something to be a wow killer and it isn't then it immediately gets a bad rep behind it. Wildstar wasn't a bad game per se it was just completely mismanaged.<br />
<br />
Pisses me off a bit to no extent because there are loads of great games outside of WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What? The WS community itself was arrogant about its future, much like Lawbreakers devs vs Overwatch. Both failed horribly.<br />
<br />
The WS community was toxic not denying it. But this whole &quot;WoW killer&quot; shit they proclaimed should never have been taken seriously.<br />
<br />
The people who proclaim the next MMO to be a WoW killer are idiots mate. Not saying you are of course but well it's best to pay that kind of person no heed.<br />
<br />
If anything Wildstars huge toxicity was it's RP community. Horrid little cliques who put you through hoops just to even be &quot;worthy&quot; of playing with them. Arguably one of the worst RP communities of any game.</div></div><hr />

Yes because I'm sure Ion himself worked on this directly and neglected the game.....<br />

Most that would have been involved is the Art/PR team and even then the artwork was outsourced. Get a grip.</div></div><hr />

Well no it's not....<br />
<br />
The art department don't do anything that you listed to the game other than possible layout design and concept art.<br />
<br />
But sure let's let a lead artist have a crack at game fixes. Should work wonders.<br />
<br />
And no let's not pretend resources were diverted. Most of the work would have been outsourced. The most involved team will have been the PR one.<br />
<br />
If you are going to dump on a company for the sake of it over some art then at least try to make it appear like actual criticism. It's more hilarious that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because I know some of the community was a bit.... special but I doubt they went that far personally. <br />
<br />
Certainly. Here's a string comment to a huge debacle. Basically they came from being THE top raiders in Wildstar. When they came to the forums, not only were they super aggressive, but ALL of their players were trouble. They began becoming blacklisted among communities, and a lot were permabanned for RMT. This was one of their last somewhat decent encounters with people, as immediately after this the GM was karma sank in any forum due to his ultra hostile behavior.<br />
<br />
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/6lgivs/invective_official_response/<br />
<br />
Edit: IIRC- the whole drama started unfolding about a year into their guild attempting to day raid to beat Method- whom they accused of guild poaching. <br />
Nothing was outlandish until a former guild member(Artice I believe) who was poached by Method dropped a shell of a truth bomb<br />
<br />
* The GM decided that despite trying to day raid to beat other progression guilds, he would also cycle out alts and gear them before attempting to finish gearing his non-clique guild members who also formed their main raid team. <br />
<br />
* After coming to the WoW forums and basically saying that &quot;WoW is casual mode of Wildstar, we're going top 5 within the month&quot; they only made it to top 60. This infuriated their GM who lashed out publicly against WoW's playerbase, as well as those guild members who didn't transfer from Wildstar with them; which lead to<br />
<br />
* Publicly bashing and saying Method was their reason for failure. This is probably the pinnacle of the whole thing. What makes this so great was that when Method caught wind of this(which wasn't hard, Invective was making huge bashing posts at this point) one of their higher ranking members or the GM themselves invited them into the Discord channel... WHERE THEY RECORDED AN ABSURD OUTBURST FROM INVECTIVE'S GM. It gets crazier than that, because at points he takes pride in manipulating his guild mates into progressing basically only him and his close friends from Wildstar, and bashing Method because they used &quot;exploits&quot; and &quot;cheats&quot; to get ahead, as well as guild poaching. <br />
<br />
Oh my unfathomable fuck god. That was the best when they posted that audio. It was so crazy!</div></div><hr />

I'm going to miss Wildstar. It had a great universe, interesting and unique races, and it was both fun and really funny. Plus the player housing was stellar. It's really too bad it was an MMO, as now it won't be playable. It's one of the biggest drawbacks to MMOs- once the studio shuts down the game, it can no longer be played; there's no &quot;offline&quot; mode.<br />
<br />
Private Servers. There'll probably be at least one dedicated one to crop up once the game is fully dead. I'm not certain, but we can assume there's probably a few WildStar private servers up right now that are more populated than the retail product.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Certainly not the first casualty and won't be the last. So far the only two that have done legitimately well is FF14 ARR and I suppose SWTOR, but that could be because dedicated fan base. <br />
<br />
Then again FF14 never poised itself as a 'WOW' killer, and never even compared itself to wow. Although they certainly borrowed certain aspect. Which isn't uncommon.</div></div><hr />

Same here. I loved it. But it ran worse then SWTOR. Lag and GPU/CPU bugs made in unplayable for most. Instead of fixing the engine somewhat, they scrapped the large scale PvP. Large scale PvP with zergs bashing each other to pieces is what brings many people I know to MMOs. Especially if you do not die instantly for no reason, but can stand your ground for a few moments. The game would have needed at least annother six months or a year in development.<br />
<br />
I liked the combat. Like WoW with AVM, it was clearly telegraphed, which I loved. PvP was broken, but very, very fun. PvE was more fun than Mythic+ in WoW, especially in the beginning, while there were no cookie cutter builds.<br />
<br />
Hoverboards were the best form of transportation, ever. Housing could have been a stand-alone game.<br />
<br />
But at the end of the day, it ran like a potato and going free2play made all people I knew quit.<br />
<br />
Going to miss it, nonetheless.<br />
<br />
PS. IMHO annother potentially great MMO that NCSoft pushed out way too soon, to save a quarterly profit margin.</div></div><hr />

Way too soon?<br />
<br />
It stopped making a profit for about a year or even more when they hid it from their quarterly reports.<br />
<br />
Keeping it up was generous to say the least.<br />
<br />
If any game was underperforming the point that it's a loss and a fair one at that of course it's going to either be shut down or at the risk of it.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the signs were there for Wildstar. Content was essentially at a halt and the letter to the players in January had the omens of it.<br />

No we didn't. That was an absolute mockery of a proper housing system other games at the time had.<br />
<br />
Wildstar and Rift are prime examples of housing done right. Your own little instance to do with whatever you want? Want to throw 100 cushions down inside the house? Go for it. Want to create a themed house? Go for it.<br />
<br />
FF14 does it pretty decently as well. However it's limited on each server which is a pain in the ass on high pop servers. However really low pop ones like Lich or Zalera always have plots open.</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about? I am talking about the development and release. NCSoft pushed Wildstar out to cash in on the investment in the short run, before the hype could wear off. NCSoft pushed for a not finished game to be realeased, while the main person behind the game was dealing with personal issues (cancer). The same thing they did with Tabula Rasa. &quot;You can fix the rest later, no one will be max lvl for a while.&quot; -NCSoft</div></div><hr />

This makes me painfully sad.<br />
<br />
I didn't play it much because work forced me to limit myself to only a handful of games. I only have so many hours I can devote to gaming anymore.<br />
<br />
I ESPECIALLY loved the race concepts, and the entire game concept as a whole was just so amazing. I wanted to see them succeed - not as a WoW killer (who honestly thinks anybody but Blizzard could kill it? Who really cares about that?) but just as an alternative MMO gaming option, in the same vein that FFXIV is. The lore and the world they built was amazing.<br />
The Mordesh and Mechari were, in particular, truly unique and amazing race concepts that I don't want to see disappear.<br />
<br />
I'm going to miss my little Aurin Spellslinger, my Human Stalker, my Mordesh Engineer, and my Granok Warrior. :&lt;<br />

Plug the PC I in to a 1080p TV in another room with a long HD I cable, then switch back to my shitty monitor, and if I was to alt tab, the problem came back again.<br />
<br />
<br />
It had an issue with wildstar, the only game, I open a ticket like you should, its clearly a bug and my problem was unique, so much the GM got a dev to come and help, his suggestion? Get a new TV<br />
<br />
<br />
I only had this problem with this one game, I'm not getting a New TV when I can play all my other games just fine. <br />
<br />
Years later, got a decent job, and a decent monitor, finally went to play Wildstar, glad I waited, it was digs shit awful. <br />
<br />
<br />
Warhammer age of reckoning and wildstar are dead mmos that were said to dethrone wow... They failed, oddly age of conan, rift, aion and AA are surviving, but for how long? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
!likely missed another Mmo but they got a fate worst than death, forgotten.</div></div><hr />

Their attempt at rebranding into a free to play model was just pathetic, though. That's what sealed the coffin.<br />

Apparently they have had horrible management issues since before the game was released.</div></div><hr />

Wildstar was awesome and I played it alot. However it had its fair share of problems and that is not allowed in this day and age unless you have a fanbase like wow. I love wow as well. And between a sub in wow or wildstar, wow has won it for me back then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still a sad news. Wildstar had some great art and gameplay. Even if the thing was a mess.<br />
<br />
oh people loved 40 man raids,when it was in wow and bosses had one or two mecanics,but when you make an mmo with 40 man raids and the difficulty of current wow,yeah,no one is going to put up with that,all the people who wanted hardcore wildstar had a really sad wakeup call when they realised they actualy arent good enough for hardcore....ops</div></div><hr />

When they shut it down and re-did the whole game, it had a gradual uphill climb to gain any sort of popularity. People knew it was a total shit game in beta though.<br />

I bought the original FF14 collectors edition, Boy was the original bad..<br />

Before they remade the game they even turned off the subscription costs while improving the original, It was some pretty good customer service</div></div><hr />

People keep throwing the blame at NCsoft yet NCsoft let the game basically operate at a loss financially.<br />

NMT is when it went to shit. Devs started going full on cash grab with crap like putting a gear slot behind a paywall or heavy ingame grind.<br />
<br />
Recent expansion they just gave up in favour of a progression server which ironically tanked.<br />
<br />
To be fair, they REALLY fucked up the progression server.<br />
<br />
People wanted Vanilla Rift. Instead they gave them current Rift - All the class changes and everything - But with all the new content locked behind a timegate.<br />
<br />
If people wanted that, they'd have played normal rift and just not gone further than their desired game.<br />

It certainly was, and honestly if people swore off the game forever I wouldn't have blamed them.<br />
<br />
But I do applaud Squeenix for doing the right thing and scrapping/trying again. The finished product is a LOT nicer.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
My opinion: I liked Wildstar as a game. It's combat system was interesting, everything felt challenging, and they had a lot of cool stuff going for them.<br />
<br />
However, I didn't get to max level until late, and by then the high level population was already shot. Finding a group for anything was impossible. So because everything was locked behind attunements that required you to be max level... Well, you can imagine the recipe for disaster that was.<br />
<br />
I'll be sad to see it go, but moreso because all it's assets are going to waste. Honestly, the endgame of the game could have been a LOT better.</div></div><hr />

So long Crag, wishing the game you were in was better :(<br />
<br />
Edit: there is a lesson to take from this however, not the one about how to make an mmo work or crap like that. Its the dangers of becoming addicted to an mmo itself. <br />
<br />
As someone said on the articles comment section, you pour years of your life into an mmorpg, in wildstars case, building not just characters but character housing, spending all that time and effort in making something fun you like to revisit. <br />
<br />
But unlike console games of old or even older pc games like say sims or similar games with offline accessibility, mmos like wildstar, conan, final fantasy 11 and of course wow, are or were all dependant on online access by the control of the moderators and game makers. <br />
<br />
In 20 years, I could load up a copy of the best of megaman or mario or zelda a link to the past, and relive those as much as I enjoyed them when first playing them. With MMOs, you don't have that luxury, and all the time and memories you made, you can't relive it, even if you want to.</div></div><hr />

Shame about it though. I wanted to enjoy Wildstar when it was new. But the raid attunements were out of this world, so I just quit it instead and haven't been back to it since then. That was like 4 years ago?</div></div><hr />

I feel I have to correct this. Ncsoft gave crb almost nothing for f2p. No money to upgrade the servers, no time or resources for major overhauls or changes, and they expected hundreds of thousands of players to come in immediately. Which did happen but with shit servers people couldn't even log in. It's carbines fault the game had to go free but nc didn't do them many favors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Age of Reckoning and Wildstar can hardly be put on the same level though. Age of Reckoning is still my all time favourite MMO. AoR was a casualty of EA pushing a game out a few months too early and with far too high of expectations. The game never claimed to be a WoW killer within their own Studio but as a place for Warhammer fans to have an MMO. The early release came with expected Bugs and whilst it had very favourable points to it, these Bugs drove much of the beginning playerbase away.<br />
<br />
Wildstar on the other hand overplayed themselves, adding things to a game that people considered anti-QoL by the standards of MMO's at the time, they also doubled down on it for a while until realising they fucked up and tried to scramble back to a point that people actually wanted.<br />
<br />
Basically 1 was killed by a Publisher, the other was killed by overconfidence and nostalgia.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VincentWolf</div><div class="date">2018-09-08, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shame.

Elitists quickly scared all the regular players off with their attitudes and barely in one year game went f2p. I'm actually surprised it lasted that long.

I don't mean it maliciously towards you but every time someone proclaims something to be a wow killer and it isn't then it immediately gets a bad rep behind it. Wildstar wasn't a bad game per se it was just completely mismanaged.<br />
<br />
Pisses me off a bit to no extent because there are loads of great games outside of WoW.<br />

<br />
You know it really makes me wonder what could actually kill wow. I mean the graphics are dated, leveling is a mess, classes are gutted and the story is repetitive and predictable.<br />
<br />
Yet it is still the most popular MMO cause of nostalgia and all the friends people have that they only know from wow. Oh and the fact that playes put enough time in wow that would have let them learn a new instrument or something. That commitment shouldn't go to waste. At this point it is not even a question of wether wow is a good game or not. Probably the only thing that can actually axe it if Blizz gets tired of messing with the old code and decides to do a wow 2.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monstafish2k</div><div class="date">2018-09-09, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did people ever call XIV a WoW killer? Rift is still going but not in great shape...then again neither is ToR.<br />
<br />
thats exactly what killed Star Wars the old republic. EA wanted to release it 2 months earlier (before wow addon) and what did they get for this? Game failing... and guess what? I was NOT surprised by seeing SWtor fail because &quot;EA&quot; was behind it. Everything (and i mean every god damn thing) EA touches, fails. SWtor had the potential to turn into a real WoW rival (if they have taken the time and finish endgame content before releasing the game). Both, SWtor and WoW, have a good Story behind the game and SWtor could get as strong and popular as WoW. But it was EA behind it so it was meant to fail.<br />
<br />
btw im not saying SWtor would have killed WoW (no MMO can) but it had the potentiall to be equally strong. The worst thing is, EA doesnt learn of their mega-fails so we shouldnt expect them to learn from their smaler fails (like Battlefront lootboxes).<br />
<br />
Rift failed because... you cant make a paid game, with sub (if i remember correctly) into a free2play asiagrind like FlyFF etc.<br />
TESO? Looks like a ripoff <br />
Wildstar was fun and i played it a few months at the beginning but the motivation went missing real fast even tho the graphics style and game humor was enjoyable. <br />
Most MMO´s fail because of extreme greed for monies. EA is the best example by killing one of the best games since WoW. I fucking loved leveling in SWTOR but once you turned max level... there was NOTHIGN to do. not even questing. And the temperature of my GF650ti back then went up to 110°C without going max detail in Options and what did they do about it? Nothing... how can you expect someone to play your game if they risk their hardware for playing a game without content?.... what EA does is a crime and they should be locked up in prison for that.</div></div><hr />

NCSoft is such a shitty company. I'll be honest, though, I never thought Wildstar was that appealing to me begin with. Shame for those who still played it, however. Oh, and NCSoft hates anyone trying to duplicate their work; there almost certainly won't be any private servers for Wildstar. The death of the game is pretty final.<br />

<br />
There’s a few other MMOs with decent populations. GW2 has some players and I enjoyed the combat system for a while, I enjoyed exploring the world too but the new monsters/NPCs in each zone never actually felt “new” so that turned me off during the leveling process. Once I hit max level, there was enough to do but nothing to interesting. Fractals and such were cool but didn’t hold my interest for long. Only thing I really loved was seeing the giant crafted twilight/Daybreak swords. You could look into them and see space and shit it was beautiful. <br />
<br />
Honestly those two legendary swords from GW2 are probably the best looking weapons I’ve seen from almost any game. They were just mesmerizing and really fun to look at.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would tend to agree.</div></div><hr />

I don't know anything about wildstar since i've never touched the game. I know the best wow-killer though and that's bli$$ard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually Yoshida was very open about looking at wow for inspiration. When he got the job of saving ffxiv, wow was by far the most popular MMO. He put a unique twist on things, but generally wow was the blueprint. Much live how everquest was for ffxi.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Step back, and try to look at WoW w/o all the time you've already put into it. Compare MMO X with WoW and realize just how much stuff is there for a new player to experience. We're all jaded because we've been playing it since 10 (or 12 or 14) years already. But many of us are still playing it...<br />
<br />
As a new player?<br />
- Aged graphics, boring classes, uninteresting profession system, no housing, lack of dynamic leveling content, meh quality writing, very bad trial system.<br />
<br />
Why would I play it as a new player?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I played wildstar during the second year of WoD and loved every single minute I spent in planet Nexus...<br />
<br />
Its a shame to see such an amazing/fun/loving game go down like this... wish Blizzard could bought the franchise and add it to bnet rooster.<br />
<br />
Very sad day for me :(</div></div><hr />

The old wow devs would be 100% against it.</div></div><hr />
