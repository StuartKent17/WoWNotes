<br />
Making sure Kin Raiders get the world first. It's promotional scam by Blizzard to make WoW even more appealing to the asian markets, which are the new target audience in MoP with Pandas and Pokemon.<br />
<br />
Ha! Conspiracy theory unveiled! :D<br />
<br />
But seriously, GM probably there to check on any inconsistencies and/or bugs. They usually monitor these things, I think.</div></div><hr />

thats not the point, i'm pretty sure at least 99.9% of the people who post here won't kill heroic DW. the point is this wasn't even climactic at all. deathwing died faster than his minion. what does that say?<br />

It says that the boss is hard enough that 99.9% of the players dont kill it before next xp pack. Which is the opposite of a &quot;joke of a boss&quot; like you suggested. <br />

One person quoted paragon on paragon's forums &quot;Since we had confirmed that our only competitor had used this exploit before we even considered it, using it was the only chance for a fair race. We're not racing against those US guilds that didn't exploit. What they do doesn't matter when it comes to the race. What matters is what EU guilds do and we already knew what they did, which made the decision a foregone conclusion.&quot;<br />
<br />
A fitting end to cataclysm for a guild with such attitude. The grand prize for the whole expansion was taken by someone else. But even more so, paragon is stuck at 6/8h while someone else is at 8/8h that is like being on baleroc when someone kills rag. It will be some time before they show up on these forums again but their legions of fanboys will always comfort them.</div></div><hr />

Please, enlighten me by telling me all the top-end experience you have..<br />

Rather interesting that it seems getting to Madness is harder than downing Madness. It sort of makes sense, since I guess Spine is as much Deathwing as Madness is (even drops the same level of loot). Either way, it made for a rather anti-climactic ending to this tier and expansion, although that may be attributed in part to a lot of top guilds being severely behind after the bans.</div></div><hr />

Fact is, having double lockouts... doubles your experience in there. You act as if I don't know most guilds have alts and do alt runs. They have the ability to do the same norm/alt runs, but twice as much.<br />
<br />
you are just clueless, the double lockout is only on OLD content(firelands,BoT,BWD,Tot4W). not on new content, so they didnt 'outgear' the guilds who didnt get banned.</div></div><hr />

The key point here is not the last boss, but Spine. The fact that they were able to get over that huge gear check that spine seems to be, while using a &quot;mechanic&quot; that EU/US guilds could not take advantage of, allowed them early access to Madness of Deathwing, and allowing them to defeat the encounter.<br />
<br />
No, I checked on the armory as someone else suggested. They have the same number of DS lockouts as everyone else. They just spent the time and figured out a strategy that worked. Grats!</div></div><hr />

It's a world first. GM's usually watch the raiders during these events, and this one likely asked to be in the picture.<br />
<br />
Since they are not really interfering with anything, its totally within what they are allowed to do.<br />
<br />
That said:<br />
<br />
I'm just glad that the cheating Paragon did not get this world first. Maybe this experience will knock them down a few notches, and the kids will realize that cheating is never the way to go.</div></div><hr />

check out KIN raid team's raid composition thread and then let's think.<br />
<br />
yes, they said that they have 19 DW. right. so they use EVERY DW at battle of madness? NO!!<br />
<br />
presuming they faked their comps and anybody who can using DW had a DW and DPSing with that.(yes it's ridiculous assumption.. I think maybe 9~10 DW are used and somebody would heal)<br />
<br />
Even case of that, they used only 14DW!!! oh guys... really think BL or Paragon couldn't make 14DW??<br />
<br />

But its more important to understand that even though they may have more legendaries within the guild, the kills themselves used the same number of legendaries that other guilds that have yet to kill it are using. If anything the only thing you can argue is that some players with the Legendary may have an alt that also has the legendary thus giving them the ~same gear as their main but with any extra advantages that their alt's class may provide. So yeah, either way they had the same amount of legendaries. What interests me more personally is that not one but two guilds that were previously not in the top 10 have killed spine and are both from KR, which begs the question, what problems are western guilds having with this fight?Maybe they'll get the kill soon, but maybe the next reset will come round and KIN and other KR guilds will get a 2nd kill before them, that would be amusing :D</div></div><hr />

I think it will come earlier Q2 or Q3 perhaps. I wouldn't be surprised if beta hits servers in 3 months. Then a few months of testing et voilà.<br />

Why would it? It's hardly unreasonable that heroic Spine would be the hardest boss this tier. If that's the case, then world first Madness is quite likely to go to whoever gets world first Spine. Which was KIN. They got there first and killed him first. A well-earned world first.</div></div><hr />

I expected that Deathwing is unbeatable for like at least a month like LK or so, not like 'Spine died, next day he died too lol' <br />
<br />
Now What they are gonna do till PoM;)<br />
<br />
I see that you seem to have forgotten WHY the H Lich King didn't go down for a month. The encounter (particularly heroic mode) was designed around the stacking buff. Heroic version wasn't really meant to be beat for a month or two, though it was probably technically possible. I doubt Heroic Deathwing is any less difficult, it's just that the guilds are already facing the encounter at the setting the fight was tuned for.</div></div><hr />

I've not seen all content, i've not even started on Heroic, and i've only done Spine and Madness in LFR, but honestly, it's taken 21 days to kill the end boss on Heroic. Regardless of what they did, it's still done in 25-man (where the majority of big guilds compete, you can't deny that). It's not that 10-man is more or less difficult, it's just that 25-man is where they all seem to be competing these days. GZ to them, but a little surprising to see it done so soon.<br />

I would believe the reason for guilds killing the end boss so &quot;fast&quot; is because they are getting better, most likely. <br />

It just feels a little weird that race has ended so quickly... i'm not saying it easy, just that for an expansion final boss, usually more gear/tactics are needed... who knows, maybe this guild has done an incredible job with tactics and no other guild will down it in some weeks, but frankly, I don't see that happening.</div></div><hr />

Most importantly however, we've managed to fully assemble ten legendary staves within the guild at the time of this article's publication, with two more due to be completed within the next two weeks. Adding this to the three we helped to finish, we are poised to enter Dragon Soul heroics with an astounding fifteen Dragonwraths : one for every main caster DPS in the guild, and several alts as well !<br />

Are you going to deny it? Heroic ragnaros took over ten times as long as heroic madness to kill. Speaking as a raider in one of the guilds working on heroic spine atm, it's pretty sad knowing that this is apparantly as tough as it gets.</div></div><hr />

Possibly because KIN is maybe aware their last kill has been met with a lot of unwarranted suspicion by some idiots who believe everything they read on the internet, even if it's written by an account with two posts with no evidence anywhere (or that anyone else for that matter can provide, because it doesn't exist) to back up its claims.<br />
<br />
So if a GM was watching the kill, they might've asked him or her to stand in the kill shot to kill the idea of them using an exploit right from the start.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, cuz they had 8 people with Dragonwrath in on the kill and no other guild in US or EU has that many...errr...wait. All the top guilds have more than 8. Oh well, it was a lovely theory, perhaps next time you should keep your theories to yourself.</div></div><hr />

The lack of perspective is strong...<br />
<br />
It's not about only a few being able to defeat it. It's about a fight tailored to bring those few guilds to their knees. Looks like the almighty expansion end heroic boss failed at it's job. Less then a month while his &quot;minion&quot; heroic Ragnaros fared better.<br />
<br />
And now, since the race is over, how long until Blizzard anounces massive nerfs to normal and heroic DS? They didn't wait that much after Heroic Rag was killed.<br />
<br />
To be honest, they should not touch them anymore since LFR is here now... but... ppl got used to facerolling nerfs... so guess they're alread asking for them, so they'll be able to experience the &quot;new&quot; *cof*397*cof* content... lol</div></div><hr />

Ignorant post is Ignorant. Is FL the ONLY way to bolster your roster with legendaries? What about recruitment and those who first got the staves to use as leverage to join these top tier guilds? This happened on my server to the top guild. Their first legendary joined vodka and i'm sure MANY other people decided to do the same. This double lockout doesn't mean sh*t when people with legendaries are itching to raid with the best. I'm certain Blood Legion, Paragon, Vodka, and etc. have access to any person with a legendary if they want to bring them on board and im sure they have brought in legendaries that were made elsewhere. So why are people complaining about 5 extra lollockouts like they got ilvl504 gear off ragnaros only to steamroll DW. Have you seen Blood Legions raiding regiment where they separated all their alts and mains into separate raid groups to maximize loot for their mains? Its all perfectly done on a spread sheet.

<br />
Spine SHOULD be harder, Deathwing is alive, mobile and in complete control of himself. Madness he is almost completly insane and at deaths door. The major victory is won by Thrall who was aided by the players. <br />
<br />
You may say that a fight shouldn't be difficult based on its lore associations, but Ragnaros was the same way. He is fairly controllable before we piss him off and then he becomes a monsterous fight. The situations and results are different but the effect on their difficulty is the same.</div></div><hr />
