Statistics: Rated Battleground Class Balance<br />
Continuing our ongoing statistics posts, today we look at class balance in rated battlegrounds at different levels of gear. The item level is taken from the gear the character is wearing on armory, not their maximum item level. Keep in mind that there are some characters that may not do rated battlegrounds as well as some characters that do not log out in their higher item level PvP gear. <br />
<br />
The graphs used here are not scaled starting at 0 to allow you to visualize the difference in win percentages more easily. Keep in mind the actual differences are much smaller than they appear. <br />
<br />
Sample Size<br />
<br />
Item Level 370+: 2.6 million sample size<br />
Item Level 385+: 600k sample size<br />
Item Level 395+: 25k sample size<br />
<br />
<br />
Participation Rate<br />
<br />
Item Level 370+: 17% of the eligible characters participated in Rated Battlegrounds<br />
Item Level 385+: 28% of the eligible characters participated in Rated Battlegrounds<br />
Item Level 395+: 39% of the eligible characters participated in Rated Battlegrounds<br />

<br />
Because a class always wins and always losses. Basically this chart says the team with more mages wins more and the team with more hunters lose more. Byt teams with hunters will win and teams with mages will lose.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand what they are trying to show here? That you win more with more mages and locks then hunters? That resto druids bring down teams? That you need your token prot warrior to hold a flag?I am not getting the point of this chart. I'd much rather see representation by spec. Which I'd bet would look something like: ProtW 10%, Frost 10%, Sub 10%, Affl 10% HolyPa 15%, Disc 10%, FrostDK 8%, RestoS 8%, moonkin 6%, ele 4%, MM 4%, ret 2%, feral 2%, 1% Blood dk.That way you get an idea of what specs are actually being taken, not which classes have higher win percents.</div></div><hr />

Yeah not only you :( I wasn't in RBG´s at all too. I never wanted to do them tho´because I find them stupid to be honest. Just pre made BGs.<br />
<br />
DLC - awesome :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anyaka21</div><div class="date">2012-01-17, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This article has the feeling of a slow news day.<br />
<br />
Why? Because essentially the graph tells us nothing. It has participation percentages by class. It doesn't tell you what spec of each particular class. It doesn't tell you how successful each class is. It doesn't tell you how many of the mages are part of the participation either. It just says 'x%' of 'y class' with a 'z win %'. It also doesn't show how many times or even thoughts for how often a class/spec participates, which actually could give us some interesting notions.<br />
<br />
Outside that, the easiest inference that one can actually think about it is that the team with the best gear score wins as the winning percentages go up when the item levels are higher.</div></div><hr />

If you only supply things to do in group and you go online at 10 am in the morning....there's absolutly nothing you can do, at least not for players who have been around for +/- 5-6 years. Hell, I play SC2 &amp; Anno 2070 now. I just enjoy the option to go online w/e i want and have some time on my own, i rly do. Anno is bag of chips &amp; pepsi, enjoy the game! SC2 is nerdrage, pulling my hair out but yet, w/e i do enjoy the games 300% and that's what it's all about. Edit: MMO's are just not as popular anymore. The hype from swotr was immense, and now people are dropping off. It's not fully blizzard, it's people, it's in our nature to search for change.</div></div><hr />

The maximum difference between the lowest and highest is what? 8%? and that is only at the highest ilvl. Yes I know hunters are the lowest on all graphs, but in my opinion, all is within reasonable limits and it looks quite balanced to me. Somebody has got to be the lowest.</div></div><hr />

Hunters seem to be doing &quot;ok&quot; according to this chart.

Paladin - 304<br />
Mage - 256<br />
Druid - 255<br />

Warrior - 214<br />
Death Knight - 190 <br />
Shaman - 175<br />
Rogue - 148<br />
Warlock - 143<br />
Hunter - 91<br />
Among 2000 players, approximately 200 of each class should be in there. So hunters are less than 50% of what they are supposed to represent, where Paladins are 150% of what they are supposed to represent. All in all, other than Hunters and maybe Locks and Rogues, the other classes are well within the &quot;normal&quot; limits. But Hunters are a bit too low indeed.<br />
<br />
I do RBG with my hunter, and the only thing hunters are good at is to idle at farm flag. That's it. And many other classes can fulfill that role easily. So nobody really &quot;needs&quot; a hunter for their RBG team.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I think that 'tank' is a role in RBG, especially the Capture the Flag kind.Total: 18 roles, among 2000 players, that means 110 of every role, so, expected:<br />

However, once they were implemented and I realized that the only difference between rated and regular bgs was that you were willing to form a group and I'd be penalized gear wise for not being willing to put up with people I'd otherwise simply /ignore I went on 'bg strike' for all of Cataclysm. My idea of fun does not include putting up with rude players. <br />
<br />
Before people get defensive, and I can only judge by my experience of playing this game almost 6 years, a large chunk of the regular bg players on every realm are loudmouths and people I would not group with. I did group up to pvp, with people I wanted to play with, but for the most part I went in there solo and played for the team.<br />

Now that rated bgs are in decline I've started playing pvp again, well that and the gear rewards for converted hp</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, this is totally wrong. It would only be true if there are 3 times as many paladins as hunters playing rated BG's, but there aren't. Hunters are less than paladins, but not 3 times less. So, when you look at the highest rated players in RBG, the only normalization you can use is that, how many are playing RBG's. So the &quot;roles&quot; are irrelevant. <br />
<br />
Assume there are 10000 players doing RBG's total and around 900 of them are hunters, which is an &quot;ok&quot; position to be in, not every class will occupy exactly 1000 spots. But when you look upon the 2000 highest rated players, and now there are only 91 hunters instead of 180 (which is the spot they should occupy based on the normalization of 900 out of 10000), that means at high ratings hunters are 50% as successful as they should be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All BGs should be rated IMO, based on the individual player's prformance, this is why they failed. <br />
<br />
Premades, never wanted to fight other premades; just like twinks never wanted to fight only other twinks. This concept is dead and it was obvious when premades completely stopped after they made the matching system. Keep it random, rated and with 5 players max to queue together per-BG.<br />

When other pure DPS classes have abilities like Ring of Frost and Smoke Bomb, Hunters really bring very little to aid the group.

<br />
Hunters do make pretty good base defenders though, having a pet attacking an enemy while you're feared etc isn't to be underestimated but to be quite honest, being placed at Stables/Lighthouse/w/e for the whole game can get pretty boring.</div></div><hr />

You can only balance a game on ladder representation. There's no other scientific tool you can use. Blizzard said that they are not doing that, simply because they can't, that the game is too complex to actually give every class/spec an equal footing. So they are &quot;ok&quot; as long as there are some people doing well from each class.</div></div><hr />

These were statistics pulled off the armory, which only shows characters that have been active &quot;recently&quot;. I'd presume there is a fair chunk of players that lost RBGs in the early days, grew disinterested as a result, and stopped playing that toon (either left WoW or rolled an alt). Picture an RBG guild with 10 people that lost 90% of their matches, a bunch qq and ragequit WoW and those that stay rolled pallies instead. Now the original 90% loss group disappears off the armory.<br />
<br />
I'd be slightly curious about an update on the horde vs. alliance ratio of won (normal) bgs lately. I know a year or more ago it was very near 50% (except for AV where alliance had a slight edge and maybe one other). I'm willing to accept the possibility that I'm a horrible player and somehow my play alone accounts for the disparity, but I'm seeing about a 33% win ratio for alliance (and roughly 10% in Strand of the Ancients). From what I can tell it seems to be a healer disparity. Most losses I note the other team has more healers or better healers. I routinely lead my team in healing. I am a prot warrior. That seems wrong.<br />

The reason there aren't that many rogues is probably because rogues are the least played class at 85 right now. If we'd normalize by population probably they'd be exactly where they should be. I see one rogue in every RBG I do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Close. Being a ganking superfreak works when you're facing players at 110k health and 2k resil. When you're running RBGs against clothies at 150k health and 4k resil they're still alive when your CC runs out, and then you die. That's my guess anyway, I never PvP as rogue.</div></div><hr />

THIS, x 1000.<br />
<br />
Rated BG's would have been a great idea by simply taking an individual's w/l record and tiering them accordingly, then letting folks queue just as they do for normal random BG's. Instead, we get forced raid style grouping, and get to experience snoozefests like 10 vs 10 AB. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc877bd117d6</div><div class="date">2012-01-17, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, prepare for some long wall of text incomming.<br />
<br />
First off, the way these graphs are created seem to be way off the mark, you choose 3 random arbitrairy barriers (370+, 385+ and 395+) without any argument as to why these were chosen.<br />
To me these barrier mean the following, 370-385= very outdated gear, most likely not been actively played since s9/early s10.<br />
385-395 People with mid level current RBG (ranging anywhere from 1000-1800) and 395+ is ranging anywhere from 1800-3000 (most high-level people I know are ~400 ilevel by now)<br />
<br />
These statistics therefore hardly say anything other then an aproximate skill level.<br />
To me, this says sloppy statistics.<br />
Second, the way they are measured basically doesn't say ANYTHING representable about class balance or RBG balance or even which classes leaders like to pick for their RBG's, all it says is that some classes win RBG more often then other classes.<br />
<br />
Especially in the 25k sample size, this can be VERY easily dilluted, as one good RBG player (someone who has played at ~2.2k RBG for 3 seasons) will by now have easily recked up ~400 games (I know I have around 350 around 2 chars and I didn't play any RBG in s10). <br />
If you devide that 25k by 10 (assuming just about equal representation for all classes) that means that 1 person can be responsible for 1/5th of the entire class sample.<br />
I have no idea how you can come close to even calling that representable statistics.<br />
<br />
A much better idea for measurements would have been current rating, or even highest RBG achievement earned, this could show much more interesting and representable statistics then % of games won.<br />
<br />
Further more, Win-L ratio doesn't say anything about the rating you are on, I am currently 15-1 on my alt at 1900 MMR/Rating, why? not because my class is balanced but because I play in my 2.4k mains RBG alt group with very shifting compositions, so we are never actually going to get high, yet my W-L ratio implies im some sort of super hero.<br />
<br />
After this reasoning about the way these statistics are presented, im going to tell you something about the current top-team RBG teams and their setup.<br />
<br />
For credential purposes, I have gotten 2650 RBG rating in s9 leading my own battlegrounds, now im currently at 2310 again from leading pug RBG's.<br />
The normal setup for any RBG team which is worth their salt (about 2k+) is the following:<br />
Prot War (FC)<br />
Hpal (Healer)<br />
Dpriest (Healer)<br />
Hpal or Rsham (Healer)<br />
Frostmage Mage (DPS)<br />
Sub Rogue (DPS)<br />
Affli Warlock (DPS)<br />
This is currently the backbone of any decent RBG team and any team worth their salt will run with a spine composed of these class.<br />
For the last 3 spots a balanced mix of the following classes are chosen:<br />
Spriest (1 max)<br />
Ele shaman (1 max)<br />
Affliction Warlock (1 max)<br />
Fire mage (1 max)<br />
Frost Deathknight (1 max)<br />
Balance druid (2 max)<br />
So thats about it for the average RBG setup, the higher-end statistics should represent this, which they don't, therefore there must be something invalid in your statistics.<br />
<br />
Now for the people who hate RBG, I don't understand you but to each their own</div></div><hr />

Oh look hunters have the lowest win percentage implying teams looking to win the most would not include classes that tend to lose. It's like trying to say hunters aren't broken in arena, plenty of hunters are on arena teams yet they are always the least represented class in high rankings. The higher ilvl charts show this as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd made a comment about the &quot;bad&quot; players with ~30% wins or less simply stopped playing and ended up removed from armory. It took another poster for me to notice that the stats listed are only for players 370 ilevel and up. So any players with under 370 ilevel that do RBGs aren't represented, and one presumes they are doing worse (under 50%).</div></div><hr />

In other words, 370ilvl, 385 and 395+ are the three groups, leaving a big-old 0-369 out. I think it's reasonable safe to say that some scrubs in ilvl 340, just doing rbgs for points, probably only have a 20% win rate or something. To those saying the stats are incorrect or superficial; they aren't. It says what it said it would, it doesn't really hype the data up (ok it could show the graphs from 0 to 100%, but that would be... slightly unreadable), or try to make any conclusions. You seem more frustrated by this lack of a conclusion, when really it's just random data. Now onto the real topic, and taking it only at face value; yes it shows the problems, but as someone pointed out an 8% gap (the biggest) isn't that bad. What is bad imo, is that these differences have been around for a long time now, and nothing has really been done about it. Anyway, keep it up, I personally enjoy the stats.</div></div><hr />

Hunters seem to be doing &quot;ok&quot; according to this chart. But if you actually look at statistics based on rating, of the top 2000 Rated BG players in the US, here is the breakdown by class.<br />
Paladin - 304<br />
Mage - 256<br />
Druid - 255<br />
Priest - 224<br />
Warrior - 214<br />
Death Knight - 190 <br />
Shaman - 175<br />
Rogue - 148<br />
Warlock - 143<br />
Hunter - 91<br />
Among 2000 players, approximately 200 of each class should be in there. So hunters are less than 50% of what they are supposed to represent, where Paladins are 150% of what they are supposed to represent. All in all, other than Hunters and maybe Locks and Rogues, the other classes are well within the &quot;normal&quot; limits. But Hunters are a bit too low indeed.<br />
<br />
I do RBG with my hunter, and the only thing hunters are good at is to idle at farm flag. That's it. And many other classes can fulfill that role easily. So nobody really &quot;needs&quot; a hunter for their RBG team.<br />
<br />
<br />
That makes a lot more sense and those figures would make a meaningful chart. The chart on the front page doesn't tell me anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The hunter problem in PVP is the same problem they have in PVE, by the way. They have plenty of tools in the toolbox for PVP, but to be blunt, they don't do enough damage and at high resil, that really shows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All BGs should be rated IMO, based on the individual player's prformance, this is why they failed. <br />
<br />
Premades, never wanted to fight other premades; just like twinks never wanted to fight only other twinks. This concept is dead and it was obvious when premades completely stopped after they made the matching system. Keep it random, rated and with 5 players max to queue together per-BG.<br />

These are win *percentages*, independent of the absolute number of classes that play. Last I checked hunters were one of the most common classes at 85 too, so one ought to expect more hunters to be playing rated bgs, but that isn't the case either. Personal rating would be terrible to implement if it were based on win:loss ratio since it would mean increasing queue times for Horde as Alliance are matched with suitably unskilled players. I'm mediocre at best at PvP, but I collect gear from the current season, bind my abilities and turn with my mouse and I've won just over 31% of my 1736 battlegrounds played. In comparison, I've won 52% of arena matches I've played. It would probably be even worse if it were based on damage or healing done, since it would encourage players to ignore objectives, skip utility and just tunnel vision the opposing team. Absorbs still aren't counted as healing according to the battleground chart, so fewer players would join as disc too. If they were based on objectives, it'd probably penalise healers in WSG and TP at least: I've had 9 flag returns in over 100 games of WSG, it's very rare that an enemy flag carrier dies without a melee being nearer to them than I am.</div></div><hr />

I think this bit of info is much more useful. Honestly the item level differentiation given on the front page is meaningless. Sadly, we can't see from the data that resto druids are not taken to rateds because they are so squishy, etc.<br />
<br />
Truth be told, even the distinction displayed above is skewed. EVERY decent RBG team has a rogue on it. It's almost mandatory due to Smoke Bomb. Paladin is the best healer so you will have 1-2 per game. Prot is the best fc spec so you'll almost always have a warrior. Many teams have full warlock/boomkin setup. Mage for defensive peels, Hunter for resource map defense (or use your prot).I like that pvp has been featured in a news item here but we do need some more valuable data and ways to obtain that data.</div></div><hr />

They're not paired up against ungeared teams below 370...at least not for more than a few matches after reset. But for 395+ players they win 2 out of 3 games - somone out there must then loose those games?<br />
<br />
bottom line is that it has to be people with less gear. So while the graphs don't show it, it has to be that the lesser the gear, the more you lose. Remember, these stats are based on gear, they are not based on ratings. Teams are matched up based on average of ratings not average of gear, if not mistaken.</div></div><hr />

Because a class always wins and always losses. Basically this chart says the team with more mages wins more and the team with more hunters lose more. Byt teams with hunters will win and teams with mages will lose.<br />
<br />
Uhhhh or it just means more people play Mages that PvP. Based on the polls a lot of people NEVER even stepped into RBG's.</div></div><hr />
