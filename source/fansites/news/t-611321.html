Lake Wintergrasp ... on Live Beta Servers ?<br />
Yes ! There are actually a few things in Lake Wintergrasp on live beta servers ! Even if obviously nothing is really implemented here and this is only a developer playground for the moment, we've got a short previews of the vehicles available from the goblin workshops here along with a screenshot of the ... Strand of the Ancients Battlemaster. <br />

Blue posts<br />
For additional posts, make sure you check the Blue tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/) ! I apologize to Death Knights but I had to push your walls of text at the bottom of class posts. <br />
<br />
Update 14:30 CEST - Fixed an error, the post about the hit % of the master being transferred to the pet was for warlocks, not hunters. <br />

Feral Concerns in WotLK<br />
The changes made to things like armor were done mostly to solve itemization problems. We didn't make them to nerf Ferals (or anyone). We did them because we started to consider bosses who needed to drop 30 different pieces of armor (or tokens to trade for them or whatever) because classes and even specs were heading off into distinct niches. You'll get something to make up for it. No, you aren't there yet.<br />
<br />
We're not entirely happy with the way the Feral ended up in BC. The idea was that you could be a decent tank and a decent melee dps class, so Ferals were something you wanted to bring if you weren't the kind of guild that swapped different people out for every boss. But I don't think &quot;convenience factor&quot; is ultimately a great value to bring to a raid. The problem was we were kind of stuck because if we made Ferals end-game tanks and amazing melee, then the rogues were screwed, because they couldn't go respec to tank or heal.<br />
<br />
But now we have a chance to add some new talents, and we'd like for some of them to be the kind that let a druid declare that she is more of a cat or more of a bear. It doesn't have to be shoehorning two whole talent trees into one, but even offering a few choices would go a long way.<br />
<br />
I didn't mean to sound condescending. The pot example was to offer that we haven't forgotten about bears. My point was NOT: hey, you lost armor but gee you got health stones, so why all the QQing? It was cool to see those big armor numbers on bears, and we have some plans for how to replace them (and not just with pots).<br />
<br />
The DK gets a lot of attention because it has a lot of catching up to do. There were no DKs in UBRS or MC or TK or even Arathi Basin. Nobody knows how their abilities and power system are going to work so we feel like we have to cover a lot of the ground that was explored literally years ago for some of these other classes.<br />
<br />
We will be really disappointed if there aren't bears main tanking Naxx and later raids, and cats that if not consistently as high as rouges, are at least a lot closer than they are now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/8537784293-feral-concerns-in-wotlk.html))<br />

Allow Feral Swiftness Indoor<br />
Seems reasonable to me. Done. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/8557151746-allow-feral-swiftness-indoors.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter<br />
The mana cost of new ranks is not just an issue for Hunters. We're looking at lowering the mana cost of all new ranks among all classes. We also intend to do some improvements to Aspect of the Viper. Not to mention mana return mechanics in each of the tree's (Invigoration, Rapid Recuperation, Hunting Party etc.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/8557207322-mana-issues.html))<br />
We'll be doing some improvements to Chimera Shot. We'll experiement with it refreshing the duration of the sting instead of consuming, and adding some base damage to the shot as well. It should act as an Arcane Shot replacement, doing significantly more damage (especially if serpent sting is on the target). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/8430105938-chimera-shot--discussion.html))<br />
Regarding Serpent Sting, we'll bump the damage bonus you get from this effect up. We also want to make Serpent Sting more usable for Hunters. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/8430105938-chimera-shot--discussion.html))<br />
Tranq Shot will soon be able to dispel enrage mechanics (i.e. Warrior Enrage, Rogue's Hunger For Blood, etc.). It should also be able to dispel Druids' &quot;Owlkin Frenzy&quot; effect. Also going to lower the cooldown. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/8557212585-tranq-shot--bugged-or-wai.html))<br />
In addition, Tranq Shot will also be able to dispel magic effects, and we're removing that from Arcane Shot. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/8557212585-tranq-shot--bugged-or-wai.html))<br />
Explosive Shot is intended to be three shots in one cast. Imagine Arcane Missiles, but not having to channel it. The spell isn't quite there yet, we're still not sure if it needs the AOE or not. It's not intended to really be AOE utility. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/8557020342-explosive-shot-single-target-only.html))<br />
We haven't given up hope of fixing up your existing low-level pets. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/8557022079-feedback-pet-leveling-speed.html))<br />

In a future build your Stoneclaw Totem will &quot;protect&quot; your other totems, virtually increasing their HP by a value. We haven't decided how much it will give your totems, but it should be enough to protect them from being one shotted. Totems are intended to be as fragile as they are, it's what balances out their power. If we gave Totems base increased survivability, we would have to give them increased cooldowns, mana costs etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/8557249208-shaman-totems-and-pvp.html))<br />

We plan to give all pets the master's +hit%. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/8557371843-destros-with-imp-talents.html))<br />
We have yet to do number testing, we'll balance the tree's so that their damage is closer together. That said, Destruction has less group utility than Affliction or Demonology has, which can warrant a slight DPS advantage. Even though you'll be casting DoTs as affliction, you'll still be casting Shadow Bolt's in your rotation. Thus haste/crit/death's embrace all benefit you. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/8557250119-is-it-seriously-the-devs-intent.html))<br />
Molten Core was more designed for Demonology, as that spec you have the freedom to switch between Shadow and Fire, or for more hybrid builds. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/8557151062-too-many-talent-points-in-destruction.html))<br />
We haven't yet tested Shadow Bite extensively to see if it's working as we intend, we'll be doing that soon. Not yet finished on Doomguard, but he's intended as niche pet for group situations. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/8557212840-new-pet-changes.html))<br />

Blood Frenzy<br />
This issue (who gets into the raids?) is something we are spending a lot of time on right now. Blood Frenzy is the kind of talent that could definitely present a problem if it means Arms warriors are really valuable for their debuff potential and Fury warriors have to compete for raid slots mostly on the merit of their dps. At least Fury still has PvP... oh, wait.... (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/8557209717-blood-frenzy-and-raid-synergy-in-25man-raids.html))<br />

Tanking Talent Changes<br />
After further discussion, and lots of feedback from various forums including this one, we're going to make the following changes:<br />
<br />
Vampiric Blood<br />
One Rank<br />
1 Blood, Instant (no GCD), 2 min cooldown<br />
Increases the amount of health generated through spells and effects (i.e. your own or heals from other players) by 50% for 20 sec.<br />
<br />
Unbreakable Armor<br />
One Rank<br />
1 Frost, Instant (no GCD), 2 min cooldown<br />
Increases your armor by 25% and your total Strength by 5% for 20 sec.<br />
<br />
With these changes, the mechanic ends up being pretty similar, where you have to sacrifice dps or other abilities for a mostly defensive one. However you don't feel like you're wasting Blade Barrier and overall it's easier to understand how you'd use these abilities. The cooldown still needs to be reasonably long in order to save these for the right moment rather than spamming them constantly (we want them to work like new Shield Block, not old Shield Block). You might still sometimes end up having to sit on a Rune for a bit, but probably no longer than a few seconds, and at least you won't have to worry about the ability going off when you don't want it to.<br />
<br />
Anti-Magic Shell at the very least can no longer be dispelled, and we're looking at it preventing dots and possibly all magical debuffs while it's up.<br />
<br />
We'll continue to massage the numbers to try and achieve rough parity among Vampiric Blood, Unbreakable Armor and Bone Shield (Bone Armor) so that nobody feels compelled to go down one tree just because its talent is so much better than the others. Though obviously the 3 talents will still fulfill slightly different niches.<br />
<br />
We'll continue to adjust mitigation and threat numbers in general to achieve rough parity among DKs, warriors, paladins and druids, while still trying to give each a certain type of battle they excel at. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/8557252502-tanking-talent-changes.html))<br />
<br />
Deathstrike Effect Clarifications<br />
A deadly attack that deals 60% weapon damage plus X (where X varies per rank) and heals the death knight for 100% of the damage done for each of her diseases on the target. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/8557032273-new-deathstrike-question.html))<br />
<br />
Bone Armor and Unholy Talents<br />
Bone Armor has always had an internal cooldown of 2 sec. We just changed it to 3.5 sec, same as a shaman. There is enough theorycrafting on Bone Armor right now and at least some people conclude it's a really potent ability. If it turns out to offer less protection than we thought, we'll buff it.<br />
<br />
As per another thread, we did prune down some of the talents in deep Unholy and we're hoping to be able to fit another tanking or tanking / dps talent down there to compete with Will of the Necropolis and Acclimation for the other trees. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/8557211182-unholy-contradictive-talents.html))<br />
<br />
Bone Armor / Blood-Caked Blade and Crypt Fever Changes<br />
We took Blood-Caked Blade and Crypt Fever down to 3 ranks each. We need to see if deep Unholy has enough talents now. Bone Armor (we call it Bone Shield now) is only 1 Unholy. I'm not sure where the Frost cost came from. I may have erroneously stated as such when typing fast, or the talent trees show it wrong. It's 1 Unholy though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/8557302559-suggestions-for-unholy.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Increased breath duration underwater<br />
We are experimenting with increased breath duration underwater. Currently, in the beta, most players can stay under for three times as long. Forsaken can stay under 10 times as long as an old, normal character (used to be 4). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/8557250733-breath-drowning-timer-changed.html))<br />
<br />
Addition of a Quest Giver Tracker to the Radar (Including low level quests)<br />
Yes. This is in the next build (albeit not very polished yet). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/8557021941-minor-ui-tweak-to-assist-with-achievements.html))<br />
<br />
Account Achievements<br />
Account achievements are in the works. They won't be in for the launch of Lich King but they are on the horizon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/8557020501-alts-achievement.html))<br />
<br />
Guild Bank Tax<br />
This is an interesting idea. We won't be able to get to this for the WotLK launch, but we are compliling a list of future guild improvements that we'd like to make in WoW. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/8557020518-suggestion-guild-bank-tax.html))<br />
<br />
Class changes deployment frequency during Beta Test<br />
Seriously though, it's easier for to focus on only a couple of classes at a time. We find that way we are more in sync on the direction of the class and its problems. We don't work in an environment where each person goes to their desk, throws in the talents for one class, and then we pour them all into the game. A lot of the time it's 10% actual talent implementation and 90% brainstorming and discussion.<br />
<br />
Mages recently got a fair amount of attention and death knights always do, just because they have the most catching up to do to the years of analysis and design that's been done on the other classes.<br />
<br />
But even then, you're more likely to see ability changes than number adjusting. We need to feel like the abilities have a chance of working out before we go into the mode of comparing everyone's dps and threat and survival in a variety of situations. The encounter design and item design need to be at that level too. We're still debating things like encounters and raid stacking will work. Think about all the changes: many stats are universal now (meaning melee hit and spell hit are the same as far as items are concerned), most buffs affect the entire raid, we're trying to offer fewer very specialized items as random drops, etc. etc. It ends up being a lot of changes all with ramifications for every class. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/8557022203-hey-blue.html))<br />
<br />
Raid Composition in WotLK<br />
Class design isn't done. We are shooting for more parity. Nobody should get a raid spot because their one talent brings a huge dps (or mana or healing or health) benefit to the raid that no other spec can provide. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/8557209717-blood-frenzy-and-raid-synergy-in-25man-raids.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
DPS as high as rogues, hmm. So, why should I bring more than a single rogue on a raid then?<br />
We can't heal, we can't battle rez, we have zero raid buffs, we can't tank.<br />
Druid dps should obviously be inferior to rogues, but if blizzard intends to make that a closer match.... Should we just reroll druid? Sacrifice a tiny bit of extra dps for a huge lot of utility.<br />
Surely some raid buffs would benefit rogues, armor decreasing poison, a crit aura, anything really. All we got is dps, our CC is rarely used in raids, that's what mages are mainly there for, reusable CC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hunter<br />
-We plan to give all pets the master's +hit%. Beast Masters will love this<br />
-Chimera Shot refreshing serpent sting would be a godsend and its nice to see they are finally trying to make it part of the main group of hunter shots.<br />
-Tranq Shot will soon be able to dispel enrage mechanics and will Take the dispell mechanics from arcane shot. I've never thought it was fair that we had dispell built into a general damage shot. <br />
<br />
I'm very happy in general with the state of the Hunters in wotlk at the moment<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
In a future build your Stoneclaw Totem will &quot;protect&quot; your other totems, i think as a happy medium shamans could be happy with this. It would also be nice if they added some sort of unstable affliction element to stoneclaw so that anyone who blasts the totems takes some damge</div></div><hr />

Well, maybe Blizzard should have thought about why making a single class that can fill all four distinct party roles might not be great game design.<br />

DPS as high as rogues, hmm. So, why should I bring more than a single rogue on a raid then?<br />
We can't heal, we can't battle rez, we have zero raid buffs, we can't tank.<br />
Druid dps should obviously be inferior to rogues, but if blizzard intends to make that a closer match.... Should we just reroll druid? Sacrifice a tiny bit of extra dps for a huge lot of utility.<br />
Surely some raid buffs would benefit rogues, armor decreasing poison, a crit aura, anything really. All we got is dps, our CC is rarely used in raids, that's what mages are mainly there for, reusable CC.<br />

I've wanted to post some many times before, but after reading this I simply could not hold back anymore. I absolutely agree. What good am I to raids if all I bring is DPS when I can easily be swapped out for someone that brings slightly less, but can cast when melee is useless, heal in a pinch, be an off-tank or tank in a bind to avoid a wipe, and toss the all important battle rez? And yet, the talk is always still rogues are OP.

I'm merely pointing out the fact that given the available options, what makes the most sense to a raid of 25? Do we top the charts, yes. Is that all we do, yes. If it is made that other classes that do have raid utilities can produce nearly that same level of dps, the question is, aside from that chart topping dps, what other benefit do we bring to the other 24 people?</div></div><hr />

Ok, Rogues don't have any raidsupport abilites (yet). Agreed, that is a weak point. Especially compared to a cat that has feral aura, can use a groupheal (incredibly powerfull even without healing equipment), battlerezz and offtank. But rogues are still viable to raid success. Reliquar of Souls without a Rogue would be almost impossible under normal circumstances. Spellinterrupt is becoming more and more important in raid encounters and that is a strength of rogues cats do not have (and should not). And they did not say that cats will do the same or even more damage. They will just be on par with average raid dps. Right now Cats are regularly at the bottom of damagemeters.<br />
<br />
But I guess rogues just have to wait a little longer for some love. Developers just stated (again!) that they are not working on all classes at the same time. Until now there are very little adjustments made for rogues. I definitly see that coming in the near future and would not be suprised if your class got a fine support ability too. So just sit back and wait for it. Everything is going to be ok :-*</div></div><hr />

This is always a delicate balance: main role vs. utility. (Priests could be saying the same thing right now--why bring a priest when you can bring a druid and have them off tank in a pinch?)<br />
<br />
If a class with a ton of utility (druid) does equal damage to a class with only some utility (rogue) then high-end guilds will stack druids. But the opposite is also true. If the situation is like it is now where kitty dps &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; rogue dps, then guilds will stack rogues and kitty druids are not welcome. And don't discount the utility of kick/interrupts. Blizzard (at least in BC) makes many encounters were spell interrupts are vital.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is trying to find a balance where there are reasons to bring every spec. This isn't wishful thinking on our part. They've now said it several times in the last few days. They keep mentioning 10 classes, 30 specs, 25 raid spots and that they don't want 5 specs to be &quot;no raid for you&quot;. (Though their count is low...with frostfire mages, kitty druids, etc. there are more than 30 specs.)<br />
<br />
What we have to realize is that the game is changing--majorly. Kitty form is for soloing only and maybe as an opener in pvp. Wrong. Frost mages are only for pvp and are gimped in raids. Wrong. You can't have a 25-man raid without a warrior tank. Wrong. Pets just die in boss fights so who cares about them. Wrong. Arcane mages have to chain drink mana pots and mana gems during a long fight. Wrong. And on and on and on.<br />
<br />
I, for one, am looking forward to a refreshed game in the expansion.</div></div><hr />

The utility of cat form has always been that when not needed to tank, a druid can switch into cat form and still do respectable dps compared to the other tank classes. That is why feral druids are the best off-tanks to bring when you don't have tons of adds to deal with. I don't see a problem with cat form being broken so much as players who want to have it all and play exclusively as a tank or as melee dps, all within the same talent tree. That is a luxury no other class shares.</div></div><hr />

Very incisive, both of you. I do often forget that we do have good old Kick. In fact, I recall that my role when fighting Fathom Lord was to baby sit that Priest and kick her in the face whenever she if tried any crap or on Solarion to interrupt the healing mobs.<br />
<br />
And it's true, they haven't gotten to rogues yet. I've never been a very patient person though, especially when it comes to my class, lol. In the end I just really hope that we get some decent love because after all, the whole reason I rolled a rogue from day one was to stab and wreck things.</div></div><hr />

Well, just to point out a couple of things existing now, and maybe there should be more of this: When we were first getting Azgalor down we found it incredibly useful to have the rogues use distract on him as he entered to give the raid a little extra breathing room. Wound poison on Naj'entus. RoS would be a nightmare without rogues. We usually have a rogue tank the entire first phase, and then need two rogues for kicks (this is what there should be more of) on Essence of Desire's Spirit Shock. If the rogues don't keep up their kick rotation, it is bad news for the raid. We also have a rogue tank Shahraz. We're hardly the first guild to do this, but it is a pretty exciting thing for a rogue to be able to do. I've often thought that rogues should get some type of group buff at least, and generally when talking to friends we all agree that a haste buff would be cool and appropriate.<br />
<br />
I am speaking as a feral tank who has MT'd everything up to RoS, including, incredibly Kael from 50% once when our MT got gibbed (thank you amazing healers and luck).<br />
<br />
As good as my dps is in cat form / gear, I can't hope to keep up with the rogues in our guild, and a one to three percent difference in dps is huge... and larger, obviously, if I had to OT something before getting on the boss.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chiper</div><div class="date">2008-08-05, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't say rogues have no utility at all in raids. IIRC, rogues have more interrupt options than any other class, and fastest interrupt cooldown (second to the shaman earth shock). They also still serve as decent CC (albiet, not renewable CC, and I confess I don't know the last time we used a sap in a raid). Rogues also are able to apply poisons that are crucial to raid success. These are all things that a druid cat can not do.<br />
<br />
It does seem like rogues are much more useful in 5man content than in raids (lock picking, sap, etc), but I blame that more on raid design then I do class design. When I think about where rogues really excel, however, it's PvP.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is more emphasis on rogue evasion tanking. There have been some pretty impressive examples lately of rogues holding their own against raid bosses, and I'd LOVE to see that be a real mechanic. A rogue could never be a main tank for an entire raid (especially against magic bosses), but having certain fights where a rogue tank is better would really diversify the raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not sure about the massess, but I know that's why I keep two points in my evasion to lower the cooldown from 5 min to 3 1/2 min. I saved a Gruul disaster one time thanks to that talent and many trash mobs to boot in other places. I love the videos of agility coked out rogues tanking stuff.</div></div><hr />

I'd love to see some cat buffs in WotLK that change current min/max raid set ups. If it means having to give up 3-8 points in pure-tank talents for pure-cat talents then thats a great trade.

wow, that's unfortunate, we have a feral who almost only does kitty dps (he will tank if needed, but hates it) and he's been there for almost all of our first kills.<br />

There is quite a difference from having a mob that has an AOE effect that makes ranged attacks/tanking necessary, and having a melee tankable mob that can't be tanked by a real tank because of some stupid gimmick.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zeldyrr</div><div class="date">2008-08-05, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The utility of cat form has always been that when not needed to tank, a druid can switch into cat form and still do respectable dps compared to the other tank classes. That is why feral druids are the best off-tanks to bring when you don't have tons of adds to deal with. I don't see a problem with cat form being broken so much as players who want to have it all and play exclusively as a tank or as melee dps, all within the same talent tree. That is a luxury no other class shares.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is this &quot;off-tank utility&quot; doesn't scale. How many guilds bring more than one rogue to dps in BC raids? Lots, right? How many guilds bring more than one kitty dps'er? None?<br />
<br />
Blizzard is working towards interchangeable parts. Need dps-increasing auras? Bring a boomkin or a ret paly. Need melee auras? Bring a feral or a enhance shammy. Need debilitating curses? Bring a lock or a DK. They want people to have choices. They don't want 99% of guilds to run with 1 prot warrior, 1 feral OT, 1 paly who respecs holy and prot every boss fight, 3 rogues, 1 enhance shammy, etc.</div></div><hr />

This has been covered, Summer and Winter Olympics take place 2 years between each other since 1992. I guess the Summer ones have more hype.</div></div><hr />
