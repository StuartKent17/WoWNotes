<meta name="description" content="We have a few things in the works that are going to help out a bit. One of those things is that we are going to adjust the rate at which players can level. Another is that we are working on some changes for Dustwallow Marsh which should give players in that zone more to do and make leveling go quicker as well. 
 
We'll reveal more of our plans as we get a bit closer toward actually implementing them. I just don't have a specific time table that I can give you as of yet.

Oh, I assure you, there is more than just a singular quest being added. Detailed quests, I couldn't give you. <br />

<br />
hopefully with the change, leveling can be more fun</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anamaste</div><div class="date">2007-08-22, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Mage have about 190 days of played time. From time to time I feel like that I want to have an MS war to play, or a Shadow priest, I've always wanted to have one.<br />
But when I remember how boring it is to lvl 1-70, I give up.<br />
Blizzard is agains account selling, power leveling and bot, they just don't realize that they are not attacking the right issue, the reason why people looks for this is because sometimes, they just regret of their first char choice and want to have a new one. But nobody wants to lvl a new char from 1-70. Leveling sux. Spend a month leveling from 1-70 won't make you even closer of a good player when you reach 70. I think the leveling time could be cut by 50% or even more. <br />
The entire game is designed around 70, heroic, bgs, arena, high end pve... so why make us spend a month before start having fun?</div></div><hr />

Hopefully, it will be a substantial change. It will take at least a 25% increase for me to consider leveling my 38 Priest, or any other toon.</div></div><hr />
