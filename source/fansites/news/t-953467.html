ReforgeLite (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/reforgelite.aspx) is an in-game list of stat weights, along with an interface that allows for one click reforging (based on those weights).<br />
<br />
It comes with a set of preset stat-weights for each class and spec or you can of course enter your own stat weights manually. Once you've inputted your weights or edited the existing ones, you can save them for future use so you only need to do this once. <br />
<br />
Step One: Type /Reforge Or click reforge an item at any reforger. You will get your ReforgeLite Panel showing the stats of the current gear equipped. A red stat means you have already reforged away from that stat, and into the green stat. <br />
<br />
Step Two: Stat Weights. For example, I've loaded the Arcane Mage preset on a low-geared character. You can choose to add a minimum or maximum cap, from the stats, for example &quot;Hit, at least spell hit cap, 1742.&quot; A nice note for hybrids is this addon does take into account the hit from spirit conversion and it does recognise hit talents automatically, although you can always manually adjust anyway.<br />
<br />
Step Three: Click Calculate. You now get a new table telling you what it would recommend you do. You can either use this to manually adjust your own items, or you can get the addon to now adjust these for you.<br />
<br />
Step Four: Click Show. The items with the tick next to them are items that the addon perceives to be correctly reforged.If you want to keep any items exactly as they are, check the tick. Items with the tick will NOT be automatically reforged. Anything that is not ticked, will be reforged as it has listed when you click reforge. That's one click, reforge everything unticked. You can hover over the item icon to see the full item stats.<br />
<br />
In this example, I will be reforging 10 pieces of gear, for a total cost of 178g, 47s, 60c.<br />
<br />
Note! Be careful not to click &quot;Reforge&quot; until you're sure you're ready! As soon as you click reforge it will start cycling through each piece and reforge it automatically. You can click cancel if you change your mind before it's finished. <br />
<br />
Conclusion: With this you can change as little as one piece, or as much as all of your gear - ideal for after patches when weights change, on new characters or with new gear.<br />

2011 European Battle.net Invitational: Day 1 Round-Up<br />
Blizzard's recap of the European Battle.net Invitational is now available, you can also check out the official site's Video on Demand section (http://eu.battle.net/blizzcon/en/tournaments/eu-regionals/matches/wow/video-archive) to watch the finals if you missed it!<br />
There were plenty of shockers, and even a few tears towards the end, but we’ve successfully wrapped up day one of the 2011 European Battle.net Invitational (http://eu.battle.net/blizzcon/en/tournaments/eu-regionals/).<br />
<br />
Starcraft 2<br />
After a slight delay, the matches finally kicked off at around 2pm. Naniwa and Strelok had a close round, which eventually swung in Naniwa’s favour. Ret and Tarson had a tense battle too, ending with Ret claiming the victory.<br />
<br />
There were more than a few sad-faced fans when White-Ra went out 0:2 against Thorzain in the first round, and then landed another disappointing score against Nerchio in the Consolation Bracket. This must’ve been a relief for those cheering on Nerchio, though, after he lost his first round against Socke 0:2. Following his defeat at the hands of Ret in the Championship Bracket, Tarson reclaimed some ground by beating Strelok 2:0 in the Consolation Bracket.<br />
<br />
Round 2 seemed nice and easy for Thorzain, who managed to win two games straight up against Socke. He’ll now face Ret in Round 3 tomorrow, who narrowly came out on top over Naniwa 2:1. In the Consolation Bracket, Tarson beat Socke 2:1, and Nerchio went down against Naniwa, meaning Round 3 will see Naniwa facing Tarson for a chance in the final.<br />
<br />
There were some clear victories early on in the Warcraft Brackets, as both Colgate and Showtime scored 3:0 against their respective opponents; I can’t believe it’s not Wizard and x6tence. The losing teams faced each other in the Consolation Brackets, which saw x6tence walk away with the lead after a 3:0 win. Showtime won out over Colgate with a 3:1 score on Round 2 of the Championship Bracket.<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft<br />
Both Surprise Effect and Victornox went through to Round 2 after winning their Round 1 matches against DNAW Trio and Feeling Mad. The ensuing battle between the winning teams was close, finally seeing Victorinox take the lead 3:2 in Round 2. DNAW Trio and Feeling Mad faced each other in the Consolation Bracket, resulting in a 3:1 score to DNAW Trio.<br />
<br />
You can visit the official 2011 European Battle.net Invitational site now to see the ladders, replays of the matches and more (http://eu.battle.net/blizzcon/en/tournaments/eu-regionals/)!<br />
<br />
<br />
2011 European Battle.net Invitational: Day 2 Round-Up<br />
The 2011 European Battle.net Invitational has come to an end, but what an exciting end it was. We now know who will be travelling to BlizzCon to compete in the event there, and they all thoroughly deserve it.<br />
<br />
Firstly, WoW team Showtime pulled out all the stops and defeated the finalists from the Consolation Bracket, DNAW Trio. The runners up fought valiantly, making Showtime work hard for their victory. They managed to win a match, making the score 2:1 to Showtime, but were beaten in the following game. Both teams will get to take part in the Global Battle.net Invitational during BlizzCon in October.<br />
<br />
Starcraft 2<br />
In StarCraft II, Tarson went up against Naniwa in the Consolation Bracket and was defeated 0:2. Naniwa went on to play against Thorzain, who was previously beaten by Ret in the Championship Bracket. Naniwa also walked away from that match with a 2:1 victory, and entry into the Grand Final.<br />
<br />
Both Ret and Naniwa seemed icy cool as they began the Grand Final match, each walking on stage to a rapturous reception. However, Ret won the first match after catching Naniwa off-guard. The second match was over even quicker, as Naniwa tried a new tactic which, sadly, just didn’t pay off. Ret hardly seemed to break a sweat as he won the Grand Final 2:0.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft<br />
As with the WoW finalists, both Ret and Naniwa will take part in the Global Battle.net Invitational at BlizzCon. We’ll see you there!<br />
<br />

<br />
I was quite surprised they didn´t have 2 streams...<br />
and to start of the day with a 2h delay...<br />
<br />
You would think Blizz would care more. <br />
I mean shit happens but i watch so many tournaments that run smoothly. <br />
<br />
HOW HARD CAN IT BE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Also please do not bring RotterdaM to a tournament as a Commentator.<br />
I have no Problems with people having an accent but the guy was talking blurredly.<br />
And listening to a Commentator shouldn't be a pain in the ass.<br />
Please next time bring someone who can articulate clearly.</div></div><hr />

This. That site updates your character when you reforge. Or if it struggles, simply log out and back into the toon an force an update.<br />
<br />
But i guess it will be pretty funny watching the huge amount of bad players in the game, claim they are doing it right, yet have no clue that they're doing it wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea make sure the statweights are right, remember that you need MUCH less hit in pvp compared to pve, tried this addon and it works perfectly for warlocks (aslong as you dont screw the weights)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melilithia</div><div class="date">2011-08-08, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see the point in this addon... I just go to ElitistJerks, and look at my characters' stats page, to see what stats are best for me right now</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mammoth</div><div class="date">2011-08-08, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was like &quot;oh neat, I can get this addon and it'll make reforging easier.&quot; But then I realised as a tank, it's absolutely useless, the value of Dodge/Parry/Mastery change as you get more of them; weights just don't cut it. If you have to research your current weights every time you want to reforge, you might as well use the same website to tell you how to do it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc99cfbcce04</div><div class="date">2011-08-08, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why before and after reforge you have exactly the same reforges? It costed you 178g to tick some checkboxes?<br />
<br />
That screen is showing the &quot;best reforge&quot;, it is not showing what your actual reforges are - the tick box indicates that this is what you already have. On the first one, it shows that some are unticked - those are NOT reforged the way it says (that is what it wants you to reforge to). You have the option to then tick the boxes you want to change (or leave them unticked, and do that piece manually). So yes, in before and after - the difference is that it recognises my gear as being the way it wants it to be. The recommendations will be the same for both.<br />
<br />
<br />
Too bad your stat weights change after like reforging 2 piece <br />
<br />
The preset stat weights are really for very low geared (or very lazy) people. The best way to do it is input your own stat weights based on your gear, and click save. Then you will have a set of stat weights saved to your specifications which you can tweak as your caps or gear change.<br />
<br />
<br />
And arcane reforges mastery away in t11 gear since when exactly?<br />
<br />
It's just an example, like it says in my review - check your stat weights first - it is obviously important that you do this, and if you're sure the stat weights are wrong, write a comment on curse and get it updated as I'm sure it'll help other people. I deliberately picked a low-geared alt I don't play because that's what I had that wasn't already reforged - to take a screenshot with. I had to use something and whatever I used I'm sure someone would argue it's wrong :)<br />
<br />
I think some people are putting too much emphasis on the usefulness of the addon being &quot;preset stat weights&quot;, that's just a feature for people who are very new to the game, very lazy, or play a class that doesn't really change much (there are a few classes/specs where these weights fit perfectly whatever your gear, but not many). The point is you can set your own stat weights, your own caps, as you choose, save those, and then reforge based on what you wanted - with a single click, in the future :) If you're happy alt-tabbing and loading your character in askmrrobot, keep doing that :)</div></div><hr />

Then I have to look up exact statweights etc AND enter them manually, sort of defeats the purpose of it being an easy and fast way to check reforges (for PvP at least).. But I was talking about the website askmrrobot, not the addon.</div></div><hr />

So thanks a lot, lol.</div></div><hr />

Haste to 12,5% 2. No spirit items -&gt;reforge to spirit, but keep haste softcap 3. Spirit items reforge crit to mastery, but keep haste softcap ??</div></div><hr />

I don't know I must hand it to them that they found a girl which did okay commenting this mess. Arena will never get big in the ESports Scene, no matter how much they try to push it. Because its too chaotic, you can't get all that is going on and in the games where Unholy Dk was present everything was filled with red unholy stuff... The commentary stumbled for words because they couldnt figure out what was going on exactly as well. And while focussing on one shamy who was hiding behind a box I couldnt see what the others where up to... And the game is not balanced enough to make it tactical interseting, thats why most teams consisted of resto sham and aff lock + x, not that entertaining. 2v2 would much more tactical, but we know how long these games can take, not good for tournament also. The only thing I could imagine are 1v1 Duel between Damage classes, where extreme skilled players can break through the op'nes of some classes and which would be at least fun to watch... but this... it like commenting an alterac zerg...</div></div><hr />

They had absolutely no clue what was going on. Their camera angle was horrible. The only thing that woman was saying were things like &quot;OH my god&quot; when someone was dying for like 10 seconds already. They both were so slow announcing important stuff like cool downs, casts and so on. All in all Blizzard is a horrible tournament organizer in terms of World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

Looking for stuff to disagree and naysay much? ;)<br />

It's still a time saver, and the one click reforge makes the whole thing damn easy. That's the benefit of it I guess......... It was stated it was one click but I'll have to try it out myself to see.</div></div><hr />

It's still a time saver, and the one click reforge makes the whole thing damn easy. That's the benefit of it I guess......... It was stated it was one click but I'll have to try it out myself to see.<br />
<br />
No not really, trying to figure out if im missing something about that website. I would love for them to just have a PvP reforge button, but they don´t. But who cares, reforging doesn´t require much thinking to get right, so I can live without it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RadGH</div><div class="date">2011-08-08, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reforgenator is surely better than that addon (it's funny how they call it light...). It has built in weights/caps for (probably) every spec in the game. The sources used are linked in their page, and they can be modified. Reforgenator is not automated, but it's incredibly easy. Just drag and drop from the addon and do what it tells you then click reforge. It doesn't bother listing items that are correctly reforged (unlike the one above).It also lets you set your own stat weights, choose stats to leave alone (ie. spirit), set caps to reach at different levels of gear (esp. useful for resto druid haste caps or hit caps) etc.If you're going to say your stat priority changes every piece of gear, you may be right, but it takes a large gear difference for the priority of one stat to override another (like going from normal to heroic gear, or t11 to t12). If you want to min-max, go do some simulations and get stat weights relative to your gear and plug them in!</div></div><hr />

<br />
As to the usefulness of these kinds of calculators I like them, granted they don't make a huge difference if you watch what you are doing but it is a quick way to maximize your best stat while still getting JUST to hit cap/expertise cap for PvE so as to not have any wasted stats.</div></div><hr />

Well seeing as stat weights can change depending on your current gear, its best to work out your stat weights manually through sims etc, and not just go to the stat weights for BiS gear.</div></div><hr />

Is in NOT a combat sim. It will not create your stat weights. It's sole purpose is saving you time when you right click on the reforging vendor and start reforging all your gear. And truth be told, it does that extremely well.Without sitting down to calculate the stats on every piece of gear I have, I was able to get my hit chance to 7.95, which I figured was close enough as I never want to go over cap. That was before ReforgeLite. With the addon, after importing my stat weights, I was able to click a couple times and the addon calculated how to improve my hit rating from 7.95 to 8.00. I'm not kidding about that perfect 961 hit rating. Capped hit with no wasted hit rating. It also reforged everything else for secondary stat optimization and all with one click. No dragging every item into reforge window, clicking 2 drop downs...confirming..and of course without the addon I could only do that after I did my own math to figure out which items to move hit to and from.</div></div><hr />

It's not hard to do anything. This addon automates the entire process, including the actual reforging part, which is pretty handy when you've got several items to reforge at the same time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This post demonstrates a lack of understanding of the complexities inherent in optimal reforging.<br />
<br />
In the case of, for example, an Enhancement Shaman, you can certainly &quot;wing it&quot; and get Exp cap, spell hit cap, and dump the rest into mastery; however, without doing a thorough search of the space of possible reforge configurations, you will likely end up being slightly under or over the respective caps, all without maximizing your mastery bonus.<br />
<br />
Having finally tried a reforge optimization tool, I now swear by them. It's not as straightforward as you think, and if you think it is, you're definitely doing it wrong.</div></div><hr />

Its not hard to get close to hit/expertise cap... and not all classes are supposed to max one secondary stat, not only that but stats weight and thats the problem of this addon or mrrobot, they use fixed stat weights... well at least its usefull for new players</div></div><hr />

getting close to hit and expertise isn't hard, but getting exactly 961 hit and 781 expertise while keeping beneficial stats you need is</div></div><hr />

That seems like an odd reason.. should I put &quot;Lite&quot; in the name of all of my addons too? Because I (as most authors I imagine) try to make them use as little memory as possible...</div></div><hr />

Its too late to rename it though.Stat weights are as good as you can get without running a complex calculation for every reforging option, which is impossible. Feel free to calculate better stat weights for your character with simc or similar tools, so far I don't know any addons that do that (since addons have pretty limited computation power).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Addon reviews have been happening for nearly a year. I wrote one back in December 2010, and that wasn't even the first one. Recently there has been very little in the way of news from Blizzard.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;not required at all&quot;, of course that's true. You're also not required to have eyes, hands, legs, or a mouse to play World of Warcraft (no offense intended to any disabled persons). However, use of those items does generally increase your DPS and/or response time.<br />
<br />
ReforgeLite is a nice addon that lets you get the EXACT amount of hit/expertise you need, which is usually a net gain of around 10-15 Mastery/Haste/Crit. Now you can get exactly 8.00% Hit without having to minimize the game and use an outside tool.<br />
<br />
As for the people saying &quot;reforging is hard&quot;, yes it is. Reforging scenarios are NP-Complete problems (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete). Getting a PERFECT reforge is pretty damn hard. Maximizing your best stat (e.g. Mastery) while getting perfect 8.00% and 26 Expertise is actually pretty freaking hard without using a reforging calculator program or addon. I assure you that 9 out of 10 times a reforging program will beat your &quot;hand-made&quot; reforges (especially for multiple cap classes - hit/expertise).<br />
<br />
<br />
I was like &quot;oh neat, I can get this addon and it'll make reforging easier.&quot; But then I realised as a tank, it's absolutely useless, the value of Dodge/Parry/Mastery change as you get more of them; weights just don't cut it. If you have to research your current weights every time you want to reforge, you might as well use the same website to tell you how to do it.<br />
<br />
Ask Mr. Robot actually incorporates the Diminishing Return formulas into their tanking weights and is extremely awesome for accurate Tank reforging.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have my stat weights entered from simcraft, which notably was haste at 195 and mastery at 185. I set the hit to be at least 1725 and the results I got looked pretty good. I then set the haste minimum at 1993 and it took like 10 sec to calculate. The result? It reforged PURE mastery. I was like oh I guess haste/mastery got mixed up somehow. so I set the min mastery to 1993. What did it do? It reforged all the mastery to hit, leaving crit untouched, and actually reforging into crit apparently.<br />
<br />
All I can say is the mod is pretty much useless if you set a min value for anything besides hit.</div></div><hr />
