<br />
We’ve extended the duration of the WoW Classic Demo to last through the weekend, ending at 10 AM Pacific time on Monday, November 12. That should give you plenty of time to track down those remaining Zhevra Hooves, or finish cooking up some Westfall Stew.<br />
<br />
We hope you’re enjoying the WoW Classic Demo and can’t wait to share the full game with you next summer!</div></div><hr />

Knowing it's a demo and all progress will be wiped does remove some of the appeal of trying it out again, in my opinion at least. :p</div></div><hr />

It's packed every time I log in Horde-side. People are hanging out in Crossroads, dueling, and chatting. It's basically the Barrens Social Network.</div></div><hr />

I picked server 18 and it is really dead. Often I am the only one playing, lol. I actually gave a nice weapon to someone when they signed in, just because it was nice to see someone else in the zone. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

You are out of your mind if you think Asmongold or Maccuck have any power in this.<br />
This was probably their plan from the get go, or at the very least they took into consideration the amount of accounts and hours spend online</div></div><hr />

I don't care what people say about WoW nowadays. But I LOVE it dearly. I experience the game. Yes, not as fast as raiding guilds, but I can still work, have a social life, progress in life, while enjoying the magic of WoW.<br />

It's a beautiful game, and may it live on for a long long time!</div></div><hr />

what do you do for gaming after you clear LFR/normal in 2 hours, for the rest of the week?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Server 01 is the first server listed, so people tended to congregate there to begin with. Then add in streamers and etc. Leveling in vanilla with a lot of other people around is torture due to tagging rules.</div></div><hr />

The rest of life. <br />
<br />
Why do you need to fill your entire week with WoW?<br />
<br />
It was amazing back when I quit WoW in WoD. I had all this time, all of a sudden.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your playstyle is that narrow, then there are other things to do than WoW? Other games, other real life stuff...<br />
If your playstyle is NOT that narrow, then you can fill 8+ hours per day with WoW, no problem at all. Collections, achievements, professions/goldmaking, reputations, dungeons, PVP etc...<br />

Where do we get the demo, I thought it was going to be on the launcher.<br />
<br />
If you bought the Virtual Ticket, it should be an option where you choose which account to login to.</div></div><hr />

One month, maybe two, is about as long as the nostalgia overhype will last anyways so it really doesnt matter :P</div></div><hr />

I know the feeling.<br />

Wish I could play a little more (now I’m roughly at about 7-8 hours a week) but I’m glad I can still enjoy the game in its current state, if it was still like Vanilla I would have unsubbed ages ago, it WAS a work, definitely.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, the only person I know irl who actually wants classic is my brother in law, and he doesn’t work or have a social life. He doesn’t like current WoW at all cause people with jobs can compete with him. He wants vanilla back where spending 16+ hours on the game was heavily rewarded.</div></div><hr />

Drinking that strong cup of delusional?<br />

Pops will drop, hopefully they only have handful of servers that hold big capacities. The initial rush of players will drop as expected in any game.<br />

Well I would agree with you, but when you remember that the big pirate server (I don't remember the name) had a huge community and they played together for long time, than maybe some people do like it, as long as they do only 1 or 2 servers I guess it will have a long life</div></div><hr />

Yeah it's not like there have been people playing vanilla at private realms for an eternity now, so people have no clue what it's really like. ...Oh wait... <br />
<br />
Classic will definitely weed out the people who wouldn't usually even play mmorpgs (thank god), but got in to WoW because the modern game is not really an mmorpg anymore.<br />
<br />
I'll be going back to vanilla, but lets just say that I'm as excited about the demo as I'd be of a Half-Life 2 demo right now. :D</div></div><hr />

No problem, WoW Classic is not for everyone.<br />
Though honestly, unless you wish to reach for bleeding edge raiding, you don't need to quit anything. Most of my guild at the time was people in their 30 with full-time jobs, kids and family life, and we managed to play and raid just fine without sacrificing anything more than, at worst, &quot;other games time&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I love whenever this argument comes out.<br />
People playing on private realms for an eternity did it for a single reason: it was free.<br />
No chance in the world they'll pay for a game they are already playing for free.<br />
<br />
Classic will bomb. Hard. Maybe not in 2 months. But i'm pretty sure there won't be a TBC classic and this whole bad idea will die in a couple years at most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I started playing in private servers back in TBC, I switched to retail because private servers sucks; no boss mechanics, spells didn't worked, etc. You don't get the same quality and switching servers is annoying because you lose everything you already &quot;achieved&quot;.</div></div><hr />
