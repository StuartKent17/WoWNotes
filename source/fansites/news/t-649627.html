[...] Nerfs are rarely (if ever) something that returns positive feedback, but we feel this change is necessary to bring this profession more in-line with the bonuses from the other professions.

<br />
but logically speaking... it makes sense, and it doesn't.<br />
It makes sense if you take into account the JC gems when compared to blue gems have an equal bonus as any other profession...<br />
But it doesn't make sense as once 3.2 hits, the JC gems are going to be inferior. And provide nowhere near as much of a bonus as the other professions...<br />

<br />
just make it all exactly the same. make enchanting give ring enchants of more than just sp/stam/ap. make it the equivalent of gems. same with leatherworking, same with inscription. not all casters want sp, some want int or spirit. jc gives us that choice.<br />

so frustrating. cant understand why they change it now. its been op since gems were introduced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Avg bonus given from a profession is equivilent to 64 AP, JC will still give 66, so actually it is still one of the best. stop the QQ</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Seriously. Hell, I'd be happier if they made them the same quality as other gems but made them prismatic. We probably lose much more switching to blue gems than we would from losing the 33 strength bonus we get from gems.<br />
<br />
JC is basically useless now. Maybe I'll be able to sell gems for more than 5g each though...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is balancing professions. JC was balanced against epic gems already AND gave you up to three socket bonuses worth of stats AND a free meta.<br />
<br />
So, release epic gems without this change means JC is still the best PvE professions by far.<br />
<br />
Release epic gems with this change, JC is on par with blacksmithing. Still better then other professions, but by a smaller margin.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">treasy</div><div class="date">2009-05-22, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reasoning is quite simple: JC allowed you to bypass specific socket colors on gear allowing them to get socket bonuses as well as their meta using very little &quot;lower quality&quot; gems. Blizzard cannot balance around socket bonuses, because they are variable (IE collar of the wyrmhunter has a blue socket with a 9 spellpower bonus, perfect example of the OPness of JC).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
to further expand on this, blizzard balances socket bonuses based on the socket colors available. There's a reason that your gear has blue sockets, it's because they're worse than red. If you want to get that socket bonus, you're going to have to use the right color gems, so blizzard can balance all aspects of the game.</div></div><hr />

You still get 3 gems that have much bigger stats than any other gems. The epic gems are unique equipped, so you cant use that argument that other gems are &quot;useless&quot;...<br />
<br />
And for the ppl whining about blue sockets, stack some stam...hard modes are nice with 17k hp i heard!</div></div><hr />

<br />

won't be. professions are all balanced to provide an advantage somewhat equal. when they'll ntroduce epic gems, the distance between the JC gems and the highest non JC will be smaller, while blacksmithing advantage will grow even larger.</div></div><hr />

Ok, for like the 10th time now for you tards.<br />

<br />
my only jc is my priest, so maybe i'm lucky. my gear has lots of yellow and red sockets with an occasional blue. i can use intel for yellow, spell for red, and push comes to shove spirit in blue. even the mutt gems like green spirit/intel works just fine for one slot. and don't forget you still have two prismatics the +4 and +6 stats.<br />
<br />
everyone is complaining that they are adding epic gems in 3.2. from what i know about that patch it is primarily the pvp patch. they only raid they are adding is the new OS raid. and even if they add epic gems (usually only +1-3 stat increase) what makes you think they will not add new prismatics, or JC only gems. say one that takes the blue quality gem + dragon's eye to create. or even new JC only mutt gems that are green, orange, and purple.<br />

Yes it sucks that JCs won't get free socket bonuses or meta gems now, but you are making this change out to be more then it is.<br />
<br />
Epic gems will close the gap between JC gems and regularly available gems. Yes<br />
But this is in 3.2 and no one knows what will also change at that time. Think about it.<br />
<br />
Will there be JC only epic trinkets? Most likely<br />
<br />
Thats 1 point for Jewelcrafting because most other professions (aside from engineering and alchemy) won't have an epic bop item. So JCs are ahead there.<br />

Will the arrival of epic gems preclude them from making any (JC only cuts)... no.<br />
The problem is easily solved by introducing a new JC only gem when epic gems are released, or just make it so JCs can cut Perfect epic gems for themselves with buffed stats compared to normal epic gems.<br />
<br />
Before WOTLK hit, when people saw the beta patch notes, they thought Tailoring would be a horrible profession too because it didn't get any +stat bonuses, and it only had cheaper leg enchants for themselves and a cloak enchant. Now people have realized it is just as good as the other professions.<br />

Epic gems will close the gap between JC gems and regularly available gems. Yes<br />
But this is in 3.2 and no one knows what will also change at that time. Think about it.<br />
<br />
Will there be JC only epic trinkets? Most likely<br />
<br />
Thats 1 point for Jewelcrafting because most other professions (aside from engineering and alchemy) won't have an epic bop item. So JCs are ahead there.<br />

and for all the whiners... realize:<br />
- JC (together with BS) will still be the best profession for classes/specs who make better use of base stats instead of ap or spellpower<br />
- there arent any non-unique, non-profession-bound wotlk epic gems ingame, not even announced... so stop bitchin around like these are sure to come and &quot;destroy the profession&quot; only because they were ingame in tbc (where profession balance was nonexistant)</div></div><hr />

the epic jems will do 23 SP and the JC ones do 32, so by being a JC you will gain (32-23) x 3 = 27 sp!<br />
being a JC will give u a gain of 27 spellpower<br />

being a blacksmith gives you two extra sockets, so 23x2 = 46<br />

as a tailor, lightweave embroidery gives 250 SP for 15seconds with a 10% proc chance and a 45sec internal CD<br />
the buff will be up roughly 25% of the time so 250/4 = 62.5<br />

<br />
Blizzard intends each profession's bonus to be roughly equal, before this change, JC's was overly powerful through the ability to pick up socket bonuses while maximizing stats off gems. Now JCs will have to think about if that socket bonus is worth the stat shift just like everyone else. here's a note for you--- it probably isn't.<br />
<br />
<br />
as for the QQ about epic gems to come making JC not worth it, it wont happen, and if it does, blizzard will realize it after a couple weeks and patch in the fix, but it wont be by simply making these gems prismatic again, because that bonus wouldn't have been enough to make up for the fact that epic gems were out anyway.<br />
<br />
The simple fact is, if people are used to something (if it is weighted in their favor) and it gets balanced out to an equal field, they will cry bloody murder.<br />
<br />
Field test: take two kids, give one an ice cream code with one scoop, give one an ice cream cone with two scoops.<br />
<br />
Now just before they start to eat them, reach down take half a scoop from the one with two and give it to the other. guess what is going to happen. just guess. Yeah that's what everyone here is doing, only its a freaking game instead of ice cream.</div></div><hr />

Not entirely true. When we look at the statistics these Dragon Eyes give, it's safe to assume that all of them will turn into 'fixed' (red, yellow, blue) colours only, not 'hybrid' (orange, purple, green) ones.<br />
<br />
Let's take the 'Smooth [Insert Gemname] for example. The regular version is 16 rating, the Dragon's Eye version is 27, an increase of 11. Let's say you use all 3, the limit, on these gems = 3 x 11 = 33.<br />
<br />
Now look at Blacksmithing and it's two extra sockets. We put two regular ones in these sockets: 2 x 16 = 32.<br />
<br />
See ? This 'nerf' isn't that bad. All it really does is remove the freedom of the Jewelcrafter when it comes to filling slots and getting their meta-gem achievement.<br />
<br />
What we really should be complaining about is how some items have really dumb socket allocations.<br />
<br />
PS: Here's to hoping that we will receive a small 'compensation' via having these gems turn into 'hybrid' gems with the improved stats of 'fixed' ones. It would certainly make the change smoother.</div></div><hr />

'cept that ain't true.<br />
<br />
The comparisons you provided aren't comparable. It's like comparing a Mini Cooper and asking why it doesn't go as fast as a Ferrari. This change is basically downgrading the profession from the Ferrari profession, to a Mini Cooper profession. It might seem like a small nerf, but it's actually a very large one.<br />
Logic is strong in this one.<br />
<br />
[Edit]: To nit pick, yes you're right - by my logical reasoning you likely don't have any 'chromasomes' at all, LOL.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All we have now, is a 51 stamina bonus from it. Blacksmiths get that too, as well as the ability to make decent gear.<br />
<br />
First off - the BoP items each profession can make (thus far) are nothing but -starter- gear (the mostly BiS belts BS can make are BoE, thus irrelevant). If you're using that as part of what you're weighing with you're probably just an undergeared non-raider/pvper, in which your opinion is worthless.<br />
<br />
Now that we have that out of the way, what are we left with? A bonus mostly equal to most of the other professions. All right - go ahead and bring up 'epic gems' now so I can ask you for the facts about their release [read: there are none] while insinuating that you are indeed in possession of an extra chromosome. This is fun.</div></div><hr />

how many people are going to drop it still after they've spent upwards of 1000s of gold leveling it and spending days getting thier patterns? not a whole lot therefor the nerf will not fix any of the price issues and look at the numbers again please a friggin 39 or less spell power buff over the next guy or a lil stamina boost over a LW's 90 stam from his bracer enchants (50 stam more than everyone else)....or an enchanters ring enchants which give 38 spell power... theres also prismatics EVERYONE else can use +6 to all stats ...aint bad for pvp for a lot of ppl...and it makes it so u can fill those useless slots or fill a meta achievement...</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 socket - socket bonus worth 4 stat points (8 AP)<br />
2 sockets - socket bonus worth 6 stat points (12 AP)<br />
3 sockets - Socket Bonus worth 8 stat points (16 AP)<br />
<br />
giving JCs 3 prismatic gems, would let you unlock 3 socket bonuses you would of had to give up some form of stat via blue/hybrid gem to activate. So, the JC bonus was 33 stat points (66 AP) plus probably another 12 stat points through free socket bonuses, making JC as much as 50% better than all other single professions.<br />
<br />
obviously it was going to be fixed.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's fault is in the fact that they put the fix off for so long, not in the fix itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for &quot;Epic Gems&quot; to come. If epic gems will devalue JC's &quot;Bonus&quot; then they will probably be putting in something like new JC only Gem cuts bought with Tier 9 badges or whatever, They will be keeping professions as equal as they can in benefit because they DON'T want raiders all taking some specific profession just because it performs the best. They WANT everyone choosing whatever profession they enjoy or want to do for reasons other than, Hey this one is the best because it gives the biggest bonus.</div></div><hr />

they aren't that variable, but they are not accounted for in the value of the JC gems either.<br />

True, they could of just nerfed all the JC gems down to +22 to each stat (44ap/34sta) instead of removing prismatic... would that have been more favorable in all of the JC'rs eyes?</div></div><hr />

Blizzard cannot balance, they have shown this in every aspect of the game. So instead of balancing things they routinely nerf problems into the ground and all is well until a new problem child arises...they then nerf that to the ground...nerfing things does not solve the underlying problem of balance. By buffing things to the best level it cuts off the dangers (most of the time) of a new problem child arising. Also considering that by buffing instead of nerfing they could do the same for content and allow for more epic scope of battle. Its a simple fact I learned as a DM, if you allow the players leeway within the rules of the game you can let loose with the opposition to them. So instead of the constant nerfing of Ulduar content and upcomming content they can let loose and people can have their challenging content.</div></div><hr />

I think the best solution would be a complete revamp of the profession system. The only point to pick up non-gathering profession is to add a bit of extra damage to your attacks and the only point to pick gathering one is to... gather?

<br />
This is honestly one of the dumbest things I've read concerning buffs/nerfs.<br />
<br />
What you're suggesting is that whenever an imbalance is discovered, they should buff every other class/race/profession to compensate, rather then nerf the one trait which is OP.<br />
<br />
By that logic, think of what would've happened when Ret Paladins were doing insane burst. It'd go like this.<br />
<br />
Ret pallys are 2 shotting people and blatently OP when 3.0 hits.<br />
Buff every single other classes abilities until they can do similar burst.<br />
Now everyone is killing each other in 5 seconds or less... your solution, buff everyones HP and survivability.<br />
Ok now people are doing crazy dps and have high survivability so PvE content is trivial, your solution...<br />
Buff every mob/pve encounter.<br />
<br />
Look at that and think if that is honestly an easier solution then nerfing one class/thing. <br />
Its not that complicated to understand and it sucks, but when it comes to balancing a game, nerfing things is generally better then buffing everything else ingame to compensate.<br />
<br />
And as numerous people have stated, epic gems are not a definate thing. Blizzard has not said there will be epic gems.<br />
<br />
And to whomever replied to my earlier point about possible epic bop JC trinkets. If blizzard does follow the trend they've used before then it is very possible that epic JC trinkets will be bop. In sunwell, most professions had an epic boe item, but JCs got epic bop items. The same thing is happening currently. There are epic LW, BS and Tailoring BoE items, so following the trend, blizzard can introduce epic BoP trinkets.</div></div><hr />

How would you propose to buff every other profession to be on par with JC? Remove meta requirements? Have each prof meet three socket bonuses for free?<br />

New OP problems always arise because all classes scale differently. 95% of the time, nerfs are well justified.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, +39 SP with 3 gems (over 3x 19SP) is so overpowered compared to the ~60 passive SP tailors get with their cloak enchant. <br />

All sockets are either red, blue or yellow. It's not luck that you only got those three...

Yeah, because the 114 AP on my bracers from LW really isn't that much... on another note, I am thinking of powerlevelling this prof (gonna dump skinning for it), and I've already got enough mats from farming on DK to get fairly high, so hopefully it won't cost me 3k... also, heres to hoping it gets me some epic trinkets in the future....</div></div><hr />

The point of this change is to make every profession as equal as possible in pve and pvp so people aren't switching between professions every season, that isn't the point of them. So Jewelcrafting will be 1-5 spell damage less than Blacksmithing in the patch... who cares. All this season you had the upper hand, so for this upcomming season you'll be a few stats behind, it's not gamebreaking. Learn to play your classes and the extra 5 attack power won't make a difference, I promise. Who knows, maybe the following season Jewelcrafting will be the optimal profession for dps by such a minimal amount that all of you scrubs that actually think it makes a difference can change back. And for the record, my mage is a Jewelcrafter, and I couldn't give a flying f*** about the change. I'll out DPS you with or without my extra 5-10 spell damage.</div></div><hr />

Another post making no sense.<br />
<br />
You're complaining about people because they thought JCs had an few extra SP was OP, yet at the same time, those same few points of AP or SP were enough for you to roll JCing, and to consider it ruined. *Some people leveled JC for those extra few points, but just because they're gone does not ruin it and make it useless.<br />
<br />
To everyone complaining that JCing is now useless, how the hell can you consider it useless when it now gives the same bonus as every other profession?<br />
<br />
I understand people being mad about wasting gold to level it, but to say its useless is just ignorant.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biernot</div><div class="date">2009-05-22, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before, jewelcrafting gave 2 advantages, that no other profession could match:<br />
a) Enabling a socket bonus without using a sup-par hybrid gem.<br />
b) Enabling a meta gem without using sub-par gem colors.<br />
<br />
Both advantages were of different gravity for classes/specs, more pronounced for dps-specs (blue sockets habe virtually no use as dps and the best meta requires two blue gems) and less pronounced for healers (every socket color gives a bonus: yellow=int/crit/haste, red=spell, blue=spi/mp5). Yes, even healers prefer to stack one certain stat, but other colors are not totally lost to them.<br />
So because Dragoneyes were prismatic, a jewelcrafter had a bonus worth of about an axtra socket, or in other words: the bonus from jc was 50% better than other professions.<br />
<br />
With this change the professions are equal, if you compare the bonus stats that you can get from nearly all professions: Spellpower, Attack Power, Stamina. Tailoring might still be a bit ahead, but the margin is small.<br />
<br />
But Jewelcrafting still has an advantage (together with Blacksmithing): Free choice of bonus.<br />
Most professions only give you the option of three or four stats, while JC and BS gives you the full choice of all available gems, including a lot of stats that no other profession can offer. This again benefits some classes/specs more than others.<br />
<br />
While before the dps-specs mostly profited from not having to use sup-par socket colors, the actual stat that gives them the most is available from nearly all professions: raw spellpower or attack power (please don't start about strength &gt; ap for some classes). With the socket color bonus gone, JC now is equal to other professions in relation to dps-specs.<br />
<br />
This leaves one type of characters, who before benefited from the customizability, and will continue to benefit: Healers. And that is because of the one stat, that has become their primary source of mana regeneration - Intellect.<br />
<br />
<br />
TLDR:<br />
- For DPS, JC will now be equal to other professions. (they lose the &quot;cheating&quot; around bad socket colors)<br />
- For Healers and some other specs, JC and BS were and will be superior. (because of the free choice of the bonus stat)<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. &amp; slightly OT:<br />
<br />
... Also the whole point of the discussion is that gemming INT is sub par for a class like a priest so you can pick up a small sp bonus...If you are looking for mana regen, gemming INT is the single best way to go. If you factor in all the effects and (raid-)buffs related to INT (more starting mana, replenishment, shadowfiend, hymn of hope, manatide totem, ...) then 1 point of INT is worth about 0.9mp5 (a little more for disc, a little less for holy), making it two times as good as spirit (1 spirit is about 0.4-0.5 mp5)</div></div><hr />

5k is nothing to me, i dont waste time mining - i use my other profession slot. The amount i costs is based on server prices. You arent thinking about WHEN i levelled it either, it was really early in wrath.

I work too hard to lvl my professions to have some snotty nose whining person that can't pvp complain in forums until game developers get tired of reading about it and nerf professions because of pvp. If you want to make things even take out all the buff and gem bonus from everyone only in pvp to make everyone shut up and wish things were back the way they were.</div></div><hr />

How about instead of nerfing the only thing positive about this profession, buff the others so there's some actual competition. My shaman has alchemy/herbalism, what does blizzard do? Nerfs that shit. Higher herb % gathering plus the guaranteed x2, x4 on proc, flask just flooded the HELL out of market. I used to make good money from this profession, and on occasion I still can but its nothing like it was before. The 2 hour flask duration is still nice, for alchemist only mind you, but its not a good money maker anymore.<br />
<br />
So I roll a DK picking the best professions within reason. I did JC and enchanting because I couldn't afford a JC + BS combo, WAY to expensive. Enchanting makes decent money still because you can't really farm greens for dust and those stacks go for 80-100g on my server. The rest of the mats fluctuate all the time. Regardless I spend a shit ton of money because JC is a nice prof, and now they decide to nerf this shit. All that hard work for what? The fact that it counted for any socket type was practically why I rolled the prof. If your going to nerf it like this then do SOMETHING so those who are JC's don't feel like they got the shaft. For christ sake the proffession was a bit too good for a long time but blizzard just sat on they're fat asses and did nothing about it. <br />
<br />
I'm telling you, behind the scenes is some fuck face who schemes shit like this, makes a class or prof a bit OP and keeps his eyes on the % of people who roll the prof or class to get a taste. Then when they've had that taste, in comes the nerf bat. So another class/prof becomes the &quot;OP&quot; and everyone re-rolls. Its like a new and better brand of drug and blizz is just having fun toying with us, making us play longer and constantly be consumed with being &quot;the best&quot;. This is QQ at its finest I know, but this shit just aggravates me. Happens all the time. <br />
<br />
unfortunately I've been one of those people who have just rolled the wrong class at the wrong time. I've never been on the receiving end of a super buff like uh, ret pallys at the end of the BC days. Man that would of been nice if I had had a pally. The biggest buff I've ever received was fucking insta cast gift of the narru. sadly the racial still sucks balls. anyways, have fun with this post trolls, I know I would.</div></div><hr />

They only removed one benefit. You can still get the JC daily and trinkets (which aren't entirely useless if you chose JC for more than just jumping on the bandwagon).<br />
<br />
Other professions have their own perks outside the stat boost. Alchemy has double the length on flasks, just to name one.</div></div><hr />

JC should never been like that on live. Ridiculous overpowered for every single class/spec (way far than eng for &quot;roguearena&quot;) in a way that you don't even know what a meta gem is except for &quot;a cute gem with free overpowered effect&quot;. Huge stats + all colors? Common...<br />
<br />
Now that we're about to get epic gems that &quot;should&quot; be equal or better than JC's gems (on stats)... why? Guess it's never late to do the right thing... and will take a while before we DO get the epic gems as a perfect option against JC's ones...<br />

This change affects raiders most of all and min/maxers. I can't see the reasoning behind it. Please do NOT implement it. JC is fine as it is, considering that the prof's value will diminish in time as you will add the new epic gems.<br />
<br />
Again, you are changing something that is working fine, which you will have to buff again in the future (when the new epic gems will become widely accessible). This occurs, of course, as a result of US Damage Dealing Forums QQ. I can remember a Dwarf Paladin's thread complaining about JC 10 days ago. It only took 10 days for the nerf bat to swing.<br />
<br />
Please guys, BEFORE you announce a change THINK of the future consequences. I believe you didn't think about it at all.<br />

MP5 sucks for Healadins? that's too bad, we'll nerf Illumination so you find it more useful!<br />
Blue gems terrible for most classes? that's too bad, we'll nerf your prismatics so you'll find them useful!<br />

tell Bliz that you don't like the haircuts they give and what happens? they chop off heads instead.<br />
<br />
that being said, i'm a Holy Pally and Jewelcrafter and i don't really find this JC thing a huge deal. so i gotta change one of my gems to a blue gem, oh well. however, the principle behind it is pretty ridiculous, although not surprising that they would go this route instead of finding a solution everyone would like. that would require thinking!</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, this change is a complete swift kick in the pants. It takes away what was both special and OP about JC and makes it completely like other professions that give 37-39 spell power and 64 attack power. <br />
<br />
My very simple solution is to only allow one prismatic gem, and buff that gem to provide 37 spellpower / 64 attack power more than a Scarlet Ruby equivalent. This would allow JC's to still avoid one blue gem, and not be a complete slap in the face. It would still be slightly OP yes, until non-unique epic gems are released. <br />
<br />
Or allow Stormjewels to be prismatic (and unneeded by JC's, as they can only equip 3 prismatic gems).</div></div><hr />

JC WILL become a weak profession for casters. Think for a second before you say that it will be on par with others.<br />
<br />
hopefully, all of the math genius' at blizzard know how to do simple algebra and can realize this.<br />
If you want to bring JC on an even par to blacksmithing or tailoring, JCs should b given 1-2 extra JC only gem spots, introduce a JC only trinket, or some other alternative buff.<br />
<br />
This nerf is understandable, but from a math standpoint, once other gems come closer in ilvl to the JC gems, JC will be inferior to the other professions.<br />
<br />
If blizzard wants to fix JCs OPness right now, the answer isnt to nerf it til its the worst, the answer is to nerf it til its equivalent.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relinor</div><div class="date">2009-05-23, 01:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The changes may 'balance' JC for now. But when the Epic Gems are introduced, JC will die as a profession as there will be no benefits for the character - the Epic gems will be of a very similar quality to the JC-only ones. I don't feel like Blizzard are looking at the long-term here.<br />
<br />
Personally I would rather Blizzard drop the strength of the JC gems, but allow them to stay Prismatic. This allows players to add the optimum stats to their character through three prismatic 1st choice stat gems in the 'unfavorable' coloured sockets, whilst still attaining the socket bonuses. This solution will also survive the introduction of Epic Gems as the JC gems retain the advantage of being Prismatic.<br />
<br />
If the current change goes into effect, many classes may continue to stack their 1st choice stat by ignoring the socket colour and failing to achieve the socket bonus. Past examples of this would be Resto Druids stacking pure +18Healing Red gems, and tanks stacking +Stam gems regardless of the socket colour. To me, this kind of activity is demonstrating a very broken mechanic on Blizzards part - there should be good incentive to achieve the socket colours and bonuses, but currently that is not the case. Blizzard need to find a way to make them attractive. Blizzard are practically defending the current broken mechanics of Sockets and Bonuses by stopping people working around it with the use of Prismatic Gems.<br />
<br />
If they remove Prismatic Gems, I think they need to clean up the whole gemming system and also find a new bonus for the JC profession.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My mining is at 375/450. I have it trained such that I could hit 450. Didn't bother to go the rest of the way since I expected them to nerf it. I could easily finish it off and smelt titansteel, but I just don't have it in me for such a silly thing. I would prefer if I got the buff to my stamina that I worked for. Currently I get no mining buff because lower ranks don't work even though I'm eligible. <br />
<br />
As I said though I don't remember there being much sympathy from people when they nerfed these professions people worked hard for on their twinks. Problem as I see it is people don't want consistency when it comes to their own stuff. I'm really not sure why Blizzard even has professions if they want them to have such minimal impact on the game. <br />
<br />
From my stand point I could really have it either way. From one side I see those that min max to the extreme to be pretty awesome in that they show us what someone can do with a class and spec. On the other end it forces those who wish to save gold or just have a little more fun with their professions to suffer. <br />
<br />
From a fun stand point though I don't think anyone likes something of theirs to get nerfed, and I think they should just work on buffing other professions to compensate not bring out the nerf bat. It seems they could look at what professions people were dropping and make changes there not changes where they are not needed. It doesn't seem hard to me, but I don't build games.</div></div><hr />

Really though, what they want is everyone to drop it so that they can stop trying to itemize around sockets, because that is just an annoying waste of time for them. No really, they just hate you and love to watch nerdrage, haha ok i am just kidding there, no really they hate you.</div></div><hr />

JCing has the hassle of requiring 3 slots you were going to use in the first place to get its benefit, and now it will have to match the correct colors. That's a lot more hassle than any of those other professions and their improving over the absense of anything comparable or one item. Honestly, why does JC need to have 3 spots to begin with? Why can't it just be one legendary gem in one slot? That could be prismatic without causing a bruhaha. Since the JC gems replace normal blues, they benefit to that degree, but you know what will happen when epic gems come out? They are going to be completely worthless. None of the other professions that have a benefit (and I have an engineer and I'm aware that engineering is worthless and that's a shame) have to worry about this obsoletion of their bonus so why should jewelcrafters?<br />
<br />
Also the benefit I think you are vastly overstating, or double stating. If you go for all set bonuses all the time, then you would be counting from the difference of double colored gems, certainly. If you dont then you would count the set bonuses you gain because you happen to get them, but you would have had an ideal gem in there otherwise. The point is you would have had a gem in there meeting one of these conditions in the first place, so you are still gaining only one net benefit over a non-jcer. Considering that the most benefit you get from JCing is if you love socket bonuses, and then it's in between the benefit gained by tailoring you listed. <br />
<br />
If you normally don't get socket bonuses, then JCing's impact isn't much beyond baseline. How do you really factor getting a 3mp5 bonus when you would normally never go for it? It's a bonus, but it really isn't earthshattering to get a few points in a stat you don't favor.</div></div><hr />

You really dont understand how gems work do you. Its not that complicated.<br />
<br />
1. Belt buckles dont affect socket bonuses in any way. The prismatic socket wording is confusing you. Consider them neutral. Put any gem you want in there for any reason.<br />
<br />
2. Gems have a colour. Sockets have a colour. If you match the two of them up, you get a socket bonus activated. If you dont match them, you dont get the socket bonus, but the gems themselves are still active.</div></div><hr />

If there isn't a new perk to JC in 3.2, I'm done with it.<br />
<br />
That's assuming of course that the epic gems are as much of an improvement as they were in BC (25% increase to the stat?).<br />
That would mean if you're using the JC-only AP gems, for example, you'd get a whopping total of 56 extra AP over someone using regular epic ones (which I assume will be +40 AP each vs JC's +54).<br />

I never said you can't put gems in any socket you want, in fact just the opposite, read my damn post. You were the one who made it seem like getting these bonuses was so critical, so going from YOUR Position I am taking losing the socket bonus as a cardinal sin.<br />
<br />
Um, is it that hard for you to seen how being the only profession that has its bonus require a matching system is a hindrance? No other class with a bonus has to worry about such a hassle, their items are just flat out better. For a JCer, our items involve now matching up 3 slots and hoping they are all workable colors or otherwise we lose socket bonuses and meta activations (Which you clearly thought were so important that our ability to get them was GAMEBREAKING). If it were just one special gem we got for the benefit, it would be a lot more workable than three, and a lot more equivalent to the other classes. They could just put all the stats on that one gem and make it unique. Look, I'm sorry engineering is a horrible, unrewarding profession, but you don't need to take that out on other people.<br />
<br />
Without the prismatic quality, fitting 3 gems into our gear to get our full bonus is inferior to an inscriber just getting a vastly superior shoulder enchant (full benefit, one slot); an enchanter and their rings (two slots, but no matching and they improve on unused territory), and the like. Again to repeat because it doesn't seem to sink into you, having to match colors and synergize for the same benefit as all the other professions who don't suffer any downside, is an overnerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Do enchanters have to worry about losing socket bonuses when they use their ring enchants? Do BS need to worry about spoiling their sockets when they add their profession bonus sockets onto items? No. In fact that's probably why they were prismatics in the first place, so we could simply get our fairly earned profession bonus without having to worry if we only had a few sockets in our gear at the time or if the colors would have made the stats usually undesirable. <br />
<br />
What is so audacious to you about saying we should just have our gems be one item instead of three to have the benefit of what is usually gained over one or two items for every other profession if we are to lose such a critical function for working three items into our sets? <br />
<br />
Look I'm not even saying that the nerf isn't defensible. Just that it's unreasonable to count the benefit of JCing as if people usually gem to both blow their socket bonuses and have gems they hate in their sockets (which is what you are saying when you count the benefits of JC gems on both sides. All Non-JCers are either gemming to get bonuses or gemming for their preferred stats)<br />
<br />
The other professions' bonuses either go places that otherwise would gain no benefit (ie, ring enchants) or are so vastly superior to what you get in that spot normally it's a nobrainer (inscriptions for shoulders). JCing should be be on equal footing to this after the nerf. Just give us one gem with the power of the the three dragon's eyes (this is no more ridiculous than the shoulder enchants), and make it colorless and only fit in the belt buckle. It would even make us even with blacksmithers since they need our gems to fill their bonus sockets, and then we would need their belt socket to use our prismatic gem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are not entitled to free socket bonuses. You are not entitled to free meta-gem activation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, exactly. The change makes sense. If you don't think this put JC way ahead of the other professions then you're in denial or acting like a hurt school girl.<br />
<br />
Essentially JC is giving you 2 bonuses. In addition to the spell power (or whatever stat) bonus like other professions it was allowing you to ignore certain requirements and still get your stat bonuses.<br />
<br />
Now the only thing I do hope they do is make them hybrid colors. Purple, Orange, etc...and not straight up single color gems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are not entitled to free socket bonuses. You are not entitled to free meta-gem activation.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I'm not saying that. But 11 points is &lt; 33, you agree, don't you? Why should one profession need to have x3 slots for their full bonus when others only need one or two? You are willfully ignoring the point I am making.<br />
<br />
Again to reiterate, we should just get one gem and it has to go in the belt buckle slot. Then we're on par with inscribers.<br />
<br />
Also, my gems are already set up so that I would qualify for my meta without the prismatics at all. I also only have one socket bonus that would be disappointing to lose with this change. Socket bonuses are usually insignificant and not worth the trouble of getting unless you are neurotic and hate not seeing the lights lit up.<br />
<br />
The point still stands that without the prismatic effect taking 3 slots to gain our bonus is outdated. No one else takes more than two positions on gear, and often when it takes two positions it's like rings or bs slots and there was nothing there to override or get in the way of in the first place. In fact, JCing is the only bonus that requires you to find gear with special attributes in the first place. Anyone else can put their sockets or enchants on gear that is level appropriate. You need to get over your JC hate enough to see that there were extra limitations on our bonus to begin with and now those are going to be more pressing with this change. <br />
<br />
Again, since you keep missing it, I'm not saying losing the prismatic effect is earthshattering, I just think these other elements need to be given a second look considering they are fall out to this change.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anuzaram</div><div class="date">2009-05-23, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a simple solution to blizzards problems regarding JC. In fact! I have TWO!!!!<br />
<br />
One: Remove meta gem requirements, but don't change dragons eyes in regard to gem set bonuses.<br />
<br />
This solves the major problem of non-JCs having to self gimp in order to get the best meta and still gives dragon's eyes that little extra bonus. If this change goes through, in order to get any gem set bonuses I'll need to get compromise gems that will likely increse my stam (YAY! JUST WAT A PLAET DPS NEEDS! MORE STAM!!!) or simply ignore gem set bonuses... Might as well remove 'em as far as I'm concerned. Ask any dps if they bother with get set bonuses... If I wasn't a JC I'd have what I needed for meta and straight Bold scarlets otherwise.<br />
Remember, in BC how stupid Meta gem requirements were? &quot;Requires more blue gems than yellow gems&quot; (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=25893) and shite like that? Now it's much better, but why have them at all? GET RID OF 'EM!!!<br />
<br />
Two: Release epic gems.<br />
<br />
Everyone I know, agrees that JC becomes less attractive as the gems that anyone can use improve... Of course dragon's eyes seem OP when compared to someone using rares! 27 strength vs 16? Bring on the epic gems!!!<br />
(And I mean gems that aren't unique-equip, such as the storm gems and such)<br />
On top of making everyone get closer to JCs in terms of benefits from gems, it makes the BS extra sockets much better than atm... I can't see a good reason they haven't released more epic gems yet.<br />
<br />
SIMPLE FIXS! NO NERF REQUIRED!!!<br />
<br />
If they go through with this nerf, JC will dropped en masse just like engineering as the min/maxxers change to whatever is seen as the best at that point and it'll mess with the Gem economies and generally break things.<br />
<br />
Blizz really needs to put away the nerf stick...<br />
<br />
Also: While I think engineering needed a pvp nerf, it was way over the top. A failing blizz seems to showing constantly...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly Blizzard is missing the mark about what makes Jewelcrafting so great compared to other professions (in my opinion) Sure its got a good bonus in the prismatic gems, but that's not what's so great about jewelcrafting.<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting has two major things that other professions simply don't have. First is that it makes money, and it makes it well. How are they going to nerf this? They shouldn't, they should make other professions be viable as an actual 'profession' that you utilized to make things that people want and will pay you for.<br />
<br />
Second is that you don't get everything handed to you. Its a challenge! I'd love most other professions much more if you had to work to get the recipes. This first gives continued interest that doesn't happen when you're just handed things (see why nobody runs heroics, too easy to just raid and get all the epix handed to you, now people sit around with nothing to do) and also it means there's diversity because people need to make choices what they spend their JC tokens on, so not every JC has exactly the same recipes: between JC to JC people have different niche markets.<br />
<br />
It's *those* to things that make jewelcrafting a wonderful profession that's head and shoulders above the rest, and Blizzard is completely missing the point. Should I say oh well at least what I care about isn't being nerfed and be glad they missed the point or would I rather they got the point and used this knowledge to make other professions more interesting and useful? I opt for the second because, well my main is still an engineer. :(</div></div><hr />

It seems like everytime some group of pvpers that can not play their toons and get facerolled they go to WoW Armory and look and see that the players that beat them mostly have JC as a profession so they go whine and say that they lost because of JCing, they should either a) quit pvp and go find an easier player to kill say a lvl 5 in a starting area or b) shut up and learn to play and take defeat like a man until you learn how to win or c) quit WoW burn your computer and take up quilting! I work too hard to lvl my professions to have some snotty nose whining person that can't pvp complain in forums until game developers get tired of reading about it and nerf professions because of pvp. If you want to make things even take out all the buff and gem bonus from everyone only in pvp to make everyone shut up and wish things were back the way they were.<br />
<br />

You're probably the example for that story there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What will this change accomplish? Let's see:<br />
<br />
a. Overpowered specs in PvE and PvP that have JC will continue to be OP. Nothing will change. JC Feral Cats will continue to out-dps all and sundry, JC Rogues will continue to push 9k DPS, and JC Rets will continue to kill people with over 1k Resilience in 5 seconds flat without even using HoJ.<br />
<br />
b. Min/Maxers will drop JC for Blacksmithy or Alchemy.<br />
<br />
c. Underpowered classes and specs who have JC, such as SP's, Enh Shamans, Moonkins and Hunters, will do even less DPS than they do now, making them even less competitive.<br />
<br />
d. Outlier OP professions such as Blacksmithy and Tailoring (for casters) are allowed to go on untouched thus making them the new min/max professions.<br />
<br />
So, the OP classes will still continue to be OP even post nerf, the underpowered classes and specs will do even less DPS post JC nerf, and the Min/Maxers will simply re-roll to the next max benefit profession.<br />
<br />
Grats GC, you have succeeded in drilling a hole in the water. Ex Nihilum Nihil.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can agree with you on those points Rukh. JC is simply useful, like enchanting you need reapplications every time your gear improves and for a while, it was a great source of TEH GOLDZ.<br />
<br />
Since my last post I've actually had a good look at the stat changes on my pally, which is a JC vs what I'd have if I wasn't a JC. I used rawr 2.2.4 and here's the results in brief.<br />
<br />
JC-anu DPS 5455<br />
NonJC-anu dps 5371<br />
Put it into a calculator, and you get a 1.54% dps difference... So what happens post nerf?<br />
JC-anu post nerf DPS 5425<br />
<br />
Soo... I'll lose around a third of the benefit I get from JC due to the nerf... Which isn't that big an improvement anyway. I dunno about you guys but I'm annoyed. I'm not gonna drop JC, if nothing else it makes me wanna pick up BS so I can put the metas into those extra sockets...<br />
<br />
About the above statistics: I used rawr to download my rets current gear, spec, etc and simply modified the gem arrangements to approximate the situation and dps in the three above scenarios, for non-JC I removed dragons eye's and made sure I had the meta requirements (2 blue gems using 2 Sovereign Twilight Opal (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40022)'s), for post nerf dps I placed 3 bold Dragon's eyes into the non-JC setup in gear that either gave useless set bonuses (for dps) such as stam or to gear where I ensured the set bonus was broken.<br />
<br />
Hope this puts it into some perspective. It certainly does make it seem a relatively weak nerf compared to engineering... Doesn't mean I suddenly like it though. :P</div></div><hr />

Atleast I didn´t do that.<br />
People that say JC will no be useless are over reacting abit though I think.<br />
You´ll still get the bonuses and the lovely thing is that you can still choose what extras you want to have.<br />
if you´re short on hit, make a better hitgem, same for expertise or you can go all out on STR,AGI,AP. so the option to let you constumize it the way you want still make good.<br />
<br />
What I really want to know tho. Will we get new &quot;JC-quality&quot; gems with for example AP+STA, or STR+STA and so on because if we are stuck with useing ordinary gems acrivate metagems (most notably 2 blue for alot of classes/specs) it will take away some of the bonus.</div></div><hr />

If you feel this change was unwarranted your I.Q. is definably questionable. The issue with gems being prismatic is obvious. Because as 90% of non-qqing intelligent players have already mentioned the prismatic gems also gave you set bonuses unattainable for the rest of the player base. If you really feel that you should have a profession that A. Gives your the same +stat bonus as others. B. Allows you to ignore meta reqs. and C. Gives you the chance to get item socket bonus others cant get. If thats balanced in your opinion I don't even know what to say. I guess to make the point even more laughable lets compare it with engineering which everyone keeps bringing up... pve bonus(s) to engineering A. Haste gloves. Oh wait that was it my bad I totally see how their the same definably unwarranted.. DAMN YOU BLIZZ always finding out about overpowered things and nerfing them subsequently I'm so totally quiting... HAHAHA <br />
<br />
Edit: On an aside to all of you who threaten to close your account/ not play anymore. By all means please stop playing you'll not be missed.

I saw so many rage threads and so may pissed off people that I just couldn't believe it. The Bornakk thread wherein they announced their -now legendary- JC nerf, has reached sixty-three pages of raging, utterly pissed off customers and counting...<br />
<br />
I can't even remember what was the last time I saw so many pissed off customers, it was prolly when the World of Roguecraft fan movie had hit the US WoW forums or back when they had announced that one point of Agility would give Hunters 1 AP instead of 2 AP.<br />

I am starting to feel bad for the Crab, I am guessing that he will be hitting the Gordon Gin Bottle pretty hard tommorow.

Im a DK with 9 slots ( not counting my meta head )<br />
<br />
If my 3 JC gems arent gonna count as blue, im gonna need 2 blue gems. Hopefully there will be a 10str 10sta epic gem once they arent unique anymore, and if there will be, i will be 19str behind BS<br />
<br />
For the quick math<br />
<br />
3x27str = 81<br />
4x20str= 80<br />
2x10str= 20<br />
== 181 str as a JC<br />
now for BS. If i were a BS i would have 11 sockets, and still need 2 blue gems.<br />
9x20str= 180<br />
2x10str= 20<br />
== 200 str as BS<br />

Imo, the world aint gonna end just because we'll be 19str behind BS, but thats just my thought.</div></div><hr />

It´s because some of us changed their profession to JC just BECAUSE of the advantages and to max DPS output. <br />
It´s not the 50 Spelldmg i´m pissed about ... it´s the point that a Billion Dollar Corp just don´t have enough money to buy actually some BRAINS and make an estimate that such things COULD Happen and wether STICK with the descision or don´t implement it in first point.<br />
This could´ve been thought through BIG time and it´s a total unnecessary annoyance of MANY people which put their ingame time/ gold in a profession just because of the Dragonseyes features.<br />
Maybe YOU for yourself get through Life without thinking ahead and just don´t care if your efforts are annihilated just because some Idiot has a &quot; smart&quot; idea ..well GZ mate for being a spineless doormat, but there are actually other people who doesn´t have endless time/money and don´t want their work get screwed over. <br />

Good game designers are iterative game designers. WoW is an extremely dynamic and long-term project. It will always change over time. Accept it.<br />
<br />
I rerolled JC for the prismatic gems, but I'll keep it for the easy cashflow. I make as much money selling gems as I do with daily quests in a tenth of the time spent actively at my computer. It's still the best profession.</div></div><hr />

Actually, to stick with your car analogy, it is more like NASCAR adding a restrictor plate to car engines. A restrictor plate is installed at the intake of an engine to limit its power. This is used in automobile racing to provide an equal level of competition.<br />
This adjustment will provide a more equal level of competition. You still have JC specific gems and I'm sure that when they introduce epic gems they will also introduce new JC gems as well.<br />
Also, JC is probably the best cash cow, combined with mining, in the game. Learn to play the AH. Everyone needs gems.<br />
Less qq, etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
the epic jems will do 23 SP and the JC ones do 32, so by being a JC you will gain (32-23) x 3 = 27 sp!<br />
being a JC will give u a gain of 27 spellpower<br />
<br />
being a blacksmith gives you two extra sockets, so 23x2 = 46<br />
being a blacksmith gives you 46 SP<br />
<br />
as a tailor, lightweave embroidery gives 250 SP for 15seconds with a 10% proc chance and a 45sec internal CD<br />
the buff will be up roughly 25% of the time so 250/4 = 62.5<br />
being a tailor gives you roughly 62.5 SP<br />
<br />
clearly everyone is just QQing about the JC nerf and it isnt going to far... /facepalm<br />
<br />
Edit: spelling<br />
<br />
<br />
You know what I find retarded? Doing your math based on items that arn't even in the game yet. There has been no information what so ever so far on those gems other than that they have been datamined out of the game files. We don't know when they will be introduced (if at all) or where they will come from. <br />
<br />
Here is a comparison of some professions. You can use attack power/stamina or whatever floats your boat to find similar results. <br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting: 3x 32 spellpower gems with a net gain of 39 spellpower compared to the 19 spellpower gems.<br />
<br />
Enchanting: 2x 19 spellpower ring enchants for a total of 38 spellpower.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing: 2x 19 spellpower gems for a total of 38 spellpower.<br />
<br />
Inscription: Shoulder enchants with a net gain of 37 spellpower over the best Sons of Hodir enchants.<br />
<br />
Leatherworking: Bracer enchants with a net gain of 37 spellpower over the best non-leatherworker enchant.<br />
<br />
The socket bonus+meta gem effect of prismatic gems coupled with the highest net gain of 39 spellpower was ridiculously overpowered, jewelcrafting is the only profession that gave an additional effect on top of the spellpower. And I haven't even mentioned how jewelcrafters can itemize their self buffs in any way they want. As an enchanter/scribe/leatherworker you can only have more spellpower (atleast for a spellcaster). As a jewelcrafter you can cut your Dragon's Eyes into hit, crit, haste, you name it.<br />
<br />
This news proves that Blizzard wants to keep the professions balanced. Yet you seriously think they will put those epic gems in the game making blacksmithing ridiculously overpowered and jewelcrafting the worst profession? Who is the real retard here?<br />
<br />
I am a jewelcrafter myself, and this naturally sucks as much for me as it does for anyone else. But you and the other 150 blind foam-mouthed rejects in these comments can thank your &quot;000mFG BLIZZARD R BE NERF ME AGAIN I QUIT GAMEZZ!!&quot; bullsh*t for having professions tweaked in the first place.<br />

You don't have heroic / naxx10-25 badges ?<br />
<br />
Do you know you can buy gems with this badges ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smapty</div><div class="date">2009-05-23, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a comparison of some professions. You can use attack power/stamina or whatever floats your boat to find similar results.<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting: 3x 32 spellpower gems with a net gain of 39 spellpower compared to the 19 spellpower gems.<br />
<br />
Enchanting: 2x 19 spellpower ring enchants for a total of 38 spellpower.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing: 2x 19 spellpower gems for a total of 38 spellpower.<br />
<br />
Inscription: Shoulder enchants with a net gain of 37 spellpower over the best Sons of Hodir enchants.<br />
<br />
Leatherworking: Bracer enchants with a net gain of 37 spellpower over the best non-leatherworker enchant.<br />
<br />
Actually, for any smart JC the net gain is much higher, never mind meta-gem requirements.<br />
<br />
As a warlock all of my JC spellpower gems go into non-red sockets, blue if possible. Assuming Glowing Twilight Opal (+9 SP) is your best SP bet for a blue socket, that means 3 x 32 spellpower intead of 3 x 9 spellpower best case. <br />
<br />
A net gain of 69 spellpower, while getting to keep all socket bonuses and +19 SP gems in all red sockets!<br />
<br />
Yea, pretty OP. I was just hoping noone would notice. Ah well. :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mardaick</div><div class="date">2009-05-23, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">your metagem only needs 2 blue ..<br />
<br />
I dont think you should use 3 bleu gems if you were not JC.<br />
<br />
2 bleu, for the meta requierement, and the last, a +19 sp, without watching at socket bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excactly my point :P The bonus of 39 was already the best out there without considering the &quot;prismatic&quot; effect.<br />
<br />
I just can't believe how people didn't see this one coming. People are so naive it's beyond retarded.</div></div><hr />

I assume (and probably making a butt of myself for doing it) that they first designed this gear with the prismatic gems in mind. For example, the rogue sets all have blue sockets in them (in addition to the typical red/yellow). I remember first thinking, wtf, why the heck would I want blue, purple, or green gems in my gear. Previously in BC, it was red, yellow, orange. The prismatic gems made sense in that they filled these horrible slots with gems that were actually useful, now I am going to be forced to completely regem with stats I really don't need to be effective in raids. If they do this, fine, but give us some other cuts of gems that will be just as useful.</div></div><hr />

That's apart of their itemization process. For example, the Ulduar gear that is of the same ilvl as hardmode Naxx/Maly/OS gear, has the same stat alotment better gem slots, making them worth getting.</div></div><hr />

if u think JC is too OP, why dont u drop one of ur prof and get JC? everyone can be jewelcrafter, is not racial bonus or something...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skiball</div><div class="date">2009-05-24, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are concerned with JCs having a matching meta gem.....that is the LEAST of their problems right now. Try fixing Arena (or getting rid of it entirely) because every season it just becomes more unbalanced. Try fixing the &quot;additional instances can't be launched&quot; crap. Fix Rogues hitting plate with 850 resil for nearly 9k instantly. Fix their own idiotic itemization by putting mp5 on healing plate which is a total waste (frustrating when they don't even know how to itemize their own creations properly). Fix SOMETHING and stop worrying about the small stuff.<br />
<br />
JC gets a free matching meta.....that is some how a huge problem. Stop Putting red and yellow sockets in the best tanking gear then if your gonna do this garbage, that is retarded to begin with.</div></div><hr />
