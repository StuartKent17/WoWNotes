On-topic: Login and Park look great! I see there is an achievement for prestige level 13 as well meaning they are going beyond the 10 prestige levels they originally mentioned, which is pretty sweet as well since it looks like PvP will have constant rewards throughout the Expansion.</div></div><hr />

I think it's because those demons. They look like placeholders because they naturally look like clones, even if they tried to make other demon left-handed by simply mirroring it's pose animation (check the knees). If the one in the front would stand few steps back and have different armor, weapon and pose, it would look much better.</div></div><hr />

Ah, don't know how I missed those before. Was hoping for a darker recolor of the warrior set, but without the asymmetric shoulders it looks kinda boring. I much prefer the paladin one, though. Never bothered to get the old set on my main because I thought the big, blue wings looked really gaudy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, really is bad story telling, but frankly, that's all I expect from Blizzard lately. No idea why he got the axe, hopefully the story behind it makes sense. Pretty shitty writing though on Blizzard's part. &quot;Oh, you're the new leader of the Horde! What are you going to do?&quot; &quot;Nothin' brotha just gonna sit back and then die.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
well duh its nearly half of may and we are still in alpha - what else do people expect that rushed unfinished bugged launch with beta shorter then 4 months when wod bta lasted 6 + ? :)<br />
<br />
Yeah, I don't get what they're trying to do either. Beta has always lasted roughly 6 months with lots of work still to do. We've got under 4 months and they're barely in the polish phase. We're also seeing just how little content Legion is offering, which is essentially WoD version 2.0 in terms of stuff to do, in other words, not much. Sure, we've got &quot;This isn't a promise, but we're going to add more throughout the expansions launch.&quot; from them, but that's seriously a crap shoot if it actually makes it or not. Judging by their recent history, it isn't going to happen. We're in for another expansion with half the content that should be in it, just so Blizzard can line their pockets a bit more. We're also still waiting on this &quot;Unannounced feature&quot; they were so excited over too. Chances are, we're not going to see it.</div></div><hr />

Why does Varian get such an extravagant monument? Stormwind has a graveyard for a reason. How big is Anduin's grave going to be? Has Varian begun a dick measuring contest the likes of which we haven't seen since ancient Egyptian times?<br />

Seriously though the new park looks great, about damn time too. Not sure about the login screen, something about it doesn't look right, probably the demons like Skeletroll said.

I just hope it won't be a flash in the pan like WoD where all was great and cool for 3 months and then it's a worthless outside since everything you get there is worse than even normal mode raid gear and all important non-gear rewards will also be obtained in that time. In other words: <br />
<br />
Let's hope very much that Legion won't be a 3 months of fun expansion put in a 18 months time frame. We had that with WoD already.</div></div><hr />

for fuck sake whats going on, who is writing this game history?<br />
<br />
Pretty much, there is stilla hope that it's not him, but then again why giving obcious accessories that model had? And we can clearly see tusks. <br />
He was meant to be MIA and now this...<br />
<br />
Secondly... does that means that trolls are left with literally nothing? He was the only prominent troll, besides him there is literally nothing. Humans got plenty of big lore heroes, and Varian had Anduin to take over.<br />
<br />
Vol'Ji had neither, he barely got title, and since then he was ignored, he didn't had any cinematic, or quesline showing him getting involved in anything. Got no heir and not even as prominent Darkspear figure that could lead Darkspears like he did.<br />
<br />
What a waste of character, all this build up all this development so he could start a new era for the Horde thrown to the trash bin so zombie elf could take over who already had enough of lore about her...<br />
<br />
I'm speechless.<br />

Stormwind mother: Hey kid's look over there.<br />
Stormwind Kids: Oh wow mom whats in there?<br />
Stormwind mother: Oh my children it's just the rotting corpse of our previous king....<br />
<br />
I really play horde but to be fully honest, Id rather have a nice park and a body to be either buried in a crypt....or better yet my body be next to my dead wife....<br />
<br />
Well, it IS a Sarcophagus, so the body lies beneath the statue, but you have a good point. The garden looks pretty, but from an in-game perspective there is a lot of wasted potential here for the sole sake of &quot;making it pretty&quot; and &quot;showing Varian's/the soldier's sacrifice&quot;<br />
<br />
1) Yes, I guess that Varian would have preferred to lie next to Tiffin. He made a memorial for her, he deeply cared for her. Whoever decided to put him on a pedestral in the park completely may just have ignored his deepest personal wishes and this is kind of sad.<br />
<br />
2) The &quot;old park&quot; acted as RP environment with lots of &quot;unused&quot; houses, a quiet area where player-run taverns flourished and where non-RP players would seldomly come to. There even was a moonwell, a gift from the Night Elves to Stormwind. Now, the new park is a memorial site and serves a wholly different purpose.

The garden looks pretty, but from an in-game perspective there is a lot of wasted potential here for the sole sake of &quot;making it pretty&quot; and &quot;showing Varian's/the soldier's sacrifice&quot;<br />
<br />
1) Yes, I guess that Varian would have preferred to lie next to Tiffin. He made a memorial for her, he deeply cared for her. Whoever decided to put him on a pedestral in the park completely may just have ignored his deepest personal wishes and this is kind of sad.<br />
<br />
2) The &quot;old park&quot; acted as RP environment with lots of &quot;unused&quot; houses, a quiet area where player-run taverns flourished and where non-RP players would seldomly come to. There even was a moonwell, a gift from the Night Elves to Stormwind. Now, the new park is a memorial site and serves a wholly different purpose. And while this is totally legit, it is a wasted potential to not include any empty houses/taverns where players can stroll in and have fun.<br />
<br />
I agree, I felt happy about the Park coming back, almost sad now that I am Horde. I remember a place where as a roleplayer you could walk on the grass in the city and have this natural feeling with a moonwell and great enviroments for hanging out...<br />
<br />
Now it's just stone floors, all green areas are covered with bushes and you are constantly reminded about V.<br />
<br />
I'm glad I'm Horde now because the new park is HORRIBLE. It will look good as you pass by but you wouldn't want to stay there for longer periods of time.</div></div><hr />

Why is Tiffin completely given the short end of the stick? Either she should be moved to be next to Varian or Varian should be next to her. Blizzard's completely outright ignoring her and it's insulting. It's no wonder more players know who Hogger is than Tiffin. Blizzard does nothing to even point out who she is/was. I'm also disappointed Varian would be laid to rest on a vulnerable outlook. Let me guess, the next expansion is Azshara and she summons some giant tidal wave that washes the park (and Varian) away so they have to rebuild it AGAIN except this time instead of a memorial to Varian, Anduin builds himself a big ass statue that's bigger than anything his father built because he now has self esteem issues or something? Makes more sense to bury Varian on a little island in the pond near the graveyard. That is if Varian's even dead. I'm still not buying it. In a game where someone like Vanessa van Cleef, Illidan, and Onyxia come back after being thought dead, I'm not putting much stock in Varian being dead. Even seeing Voljin's funeral pyre doesn't have me believe he's dead, either. Stupid to make him warchief for like 5 minutes and then kill him. Any troll could be under that mask and wrappings. That's just insulting to troll players. Just when they think they'll see a step up with troll lore, it gets flushed down the toilet faster than they can blink.<br />
<br />
Also can't say I like the map system. It gets more and more convoluted every build. How long before it's more icon than map? Hopefully there's at least a filter so we can turn on/off icons at will. Just waiting for Blizzard to add in icons for repair vendors and faction locations. I'm sure there will be treasure maps again added at some point, too, which will be even MORE icons. Then turn on archaeology which adds a red blob. Then if you're on a series of quests in the area, there's more blue blobs, !s, and ?s. That's one cluttered map.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it's that. That character was overused, it's not a bad idea to replace it (whether the replacement is good, is another matter). Also Blizzard are better writers than Martin, his monotonous books work better on a good TV production that they happened to get my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Astoundingly a failure. At this point in WoD's cycle they were more ahead, because they didn;t do as much pruning in WoD as what they are proposing for Legion. Legion's pruning is on a scale so severe it puts Cata/Mop to shame.</div></div><hr />

He was meant to be MIA and now this...<br />
<br />
Secondly... does that means that trolls are left with literally nothing? He was the only prominent troll, besides him there is literally nothing. Humans got plenty of big lore heroes, and Varian had Anduin to take over.<br />
<br />
Vol'Ji had neither, he barely got title, and since then he was ignored, he didn't had any cinematic, or quesline showing him getting involved in anything. Got no heir and not even as prominent Darkspear figure that could lead Darkspears like he did.<br />
<br />
What a waste of character, all this build up all this development so he could start a new era for the Horde thrown to the trash bin so zombie elf could take over who already had enough of lore about her...<br />
<br />
I'm speechless.<br />
I know blizzard has awful writers but I didn't expect them being this bad.<br />
<br />
the only one troll who have something in lore is Rokhan, and is not much, we only made few things, and the only major role is aid Rexxar <br />
<br />
the is nothing more, Vol'jin have only one child( what we know until now) and he died, boom, end. is ok orcs not have a racial leard, cause every clan have they own chieftain, but they left a big hole on the trolls tribe<br />
<br />
and after all the pandaria, all the effort from vol'jin, the book, all lost to make a zombie elf warchief, who dont have any love for the horde<br />
<br />
like every other character on the game is ok, in what seven hells the trolls orcs and taurens would follow a undead elf?</div></div><hr />

Actually Yenniku you speak of was not his son, the quest giver Nimboya later admitted that it was his son after all. <br />
So no information about his offspring. Secondly - even if he would have one that emerges out of nowhere immediately it would feel very anticlimatic, and people would be &quot;who the hell are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
the biggest issue I have is that all this development he received went for nothing. It was absolutely pointless, and he is the most underhwelming Warchief by now.</div></div><hr />

You generally don't rebuild a section of a city as a tomb for a dead king, unless you have a body to put in it, from a lore standpoint, or a real world, &quot;We're spending dev time on this&quot; one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because Kosak and his writing crew are utter hacks, and can only pull the obvious strings for plot lines. Vol'Jin, the obnoxious and irritating accent and way of speaking aside, was showing interest as a complex and interesting character, and Kosak can't write for a character like that, he doesn't have the first clue what to do with a character like that, other then play on player's emotions for a cheap, knee jerk emotional reaction. Kosak's integrity as a writer was left for dead in the scene where Grom takes credit for freeing Dreanor, while Yrel just stands there. Telemundo soap opera writers are better than Kosak and crew these days. At least they try.<br />
<br />
He'll kill off Sylvanas, too - he doesn't have the skills to make her great, like she was before. Just watch. She's the only interesting leader left, he'll fuck it up, no worries. It's what he does. Then it will all be bland, uninteresting, vanilla leaders on both sides, that are easy to write for, that have no depth or flaws that make them interesting and compelling. Oh, sure, he'll babble for hours onstage at Blizzcon about all kinds of cool things he's writing into the game, and like usual, none of it will appear, like the &quot;Blood Elves learning what it means to be a Paladin&quot; in WOD, or &quot;Thrall will learn what being a father is all about on Dreanor&quot; - both things were said by Kosak onstage at Blizzcon, and neither storyline appeared, instead we got Grom getting credit for freeing Dreanor. And Yrel's &quot;dark secret&quot; being ignored and dropped, and a big stinking pile of crap. &quot;Hey, ogres aren't as dumb as we thought, they have a whole empire here, with an economy and education and wealth - I know, lets kill them all, and never return to the subject again!&quot;<br />
<br />
That's why Vol'Jin: Kosak The Hack.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daem</div><div class="date">2016-05-06, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty much, there is stilla hope that it's not him, but then again why giving obcious accessories that model had? And we can clearly see tusks. <br />
He was meant to be MIA and now this...<br />
<br />
Secondly... does that means that trolls are left with literally nothing? He was the only prominent troll, besides him there is literally nothing. Humans got plenty of big lore heroes, and Varian had Anduin to take over.<br />
<br />
Vol'Ji had neither, he barely got title, and since then he was ignored, he didn't had any cinematic, or quesline showing him getting involved in anything. Got no heir and not even as prominent Darkspear figure that could lead Darkspears like he did.<br />
<br />
What a waste of character, all this build up all this development so he could start a new era for the Horde thrown to the trash bin so zombie elf could take over who already had enough of lore about her...<br />
<br />
I'm speechless.<br />
I know blizzard has awful writers but I didn't expect them being this bad.<br />
<br />
Pretty much QFT on this one. I didn't expect Blizzard to be this bad about offing a character like this. It's highly upsetting to someone that adores the character, and completely unnecessary :( Trolls will no longer have an idol, no longer have someone that unites them and speaks peace for them. It's a damn shame.</div></div><hr />

Shadow Hunters use glaives.<br />

Sure I guess you could argue that he has already had a pretty fleshed out story, but when they made him warchief of the horde, they placed him on the cusp of some amazing character development. There was so much potential, and for him to be dead would mean all we got out of that potential was 3 garrison cutscenes during WoD. He still better be MIA. I'm okay with Varian's death, because he's done a lot and developed already, it only makes sense that he passes on the torch to Anduin so he can develop too. However, I seriously hope Blizz didnt just kill off vol'jin so alliance players won't whine that blizz favors horde. The story needs SOME asymmetry.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syegfryed</div><div class="date">2016-05-06, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Yenniku you speak of was not his son, the quest giver Nimboya later admitted that it was his son after all. <br />
So no information about his offspring. Secondly - even if he would have one that emerges out of nowhere immediately it would feel very anticlimatic, and people would be &quot;who the hell are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
the biggest issue I have is that all this development he received went for nothing. It was absolutely pointless, and he is the most underhwelming Warchief by now.<br />
<br />
i dunno, i read he is the vol1jin son indeed, and the gurubashi have this thing about trade childs, and the Nymboia dialogue was changed<br />
<br />
btw, i agree, they have a big problem, and i think we will have a entire expansion with another race with not racial leaders at all</div></div><hr />

Maybe one day the horde leader won't die or step down in an expansion, but I won't hold my breathe as this is the new trend for Horde.

Don't slight the greatest high fantasy writer of all time. With his innovative writing detailed feasts, sex scenes and ending all story lines with killing the person you didn't want him to kill! Then digging up so heir to some kingdom somewhere to swoop in and replace them. The man is a fucking genius!<br />
