Changes to mana cost<br />
This is not a bug.<br />
<br />
In the latest WotLK beta push, we made a large change to the mana cost of spells. All player spells now cost a percentage of base mana rather than a fixed cost. Base mana is a special value determined by the player’s level and class, regardless of any effects or items that increase intellect. It is the size of a player’s mana pool if the player has zero intellect.<br />
<br />
This change was made primarily to prevent downranking, as it's a technique that was never quite intended. Rather than continue to find ways to penalize players for casting low-rank spells, we decided to essentially make doing so obsolete. If rank 5 and rank 6 of a spell cost the same amount of mana, but rank 6 does more damage/healing, then there is no reason to consider casting rank 5.<br />
<br />
So, each spell line (eg. Frostbolt, Shadowbolt, Greater Heal, Rejuvenation, etc.) has a fixed percentage of base mana that it costs for most of its ranks. That means each time a player gains a level the cost will go up some. The percentages were picked to attempt to keep the costs relatively similar to what they are currently in World of Warcraft. For most spells, that percentage will drop some when the player receives their highest-rank spell in existing Burning Crusade content. This was done to better fit the existing cost curve, and to keep the mana cost for level 70 players as close as possible to existing costs. Level 70 characters will see most of their maximum rank spells change in cost slightly up or down, but not by significant amounts.<br />
<br />
We anticipate there being some balance concerns due to this change, and our development staff will be ready to implement new spells, abilities, or talents to resolve those issues as the testing process continues.</div></div><hr />

This is a good thing imo. They should make all spells ingame to take over previous rank just like warrior and rogue abilities. Less crowded spellbook and more faire games.</div></div><hr />

Blood<br />
Bloodworms: Your weapon hits have a 4/8/12% chance to spawn 2-4 Bloodworms. Bloodworms attack your enemies, healing you as they do damage for 20 sec or until killed. (Healing amount remains the same)<br />

Frost<br />
Frigid Dreadplate: Enemies who hit you in melee have a 30/60/100% chance to become unsettled, decreaseing their chance to hit for 5% for the next 12 seconds. (was reduced attack speed)<br />

Chains of ice: Cooldown removed (LOL suck it druids!). Still takes 1 frost rune.<br />

Unholy<br />
Morbidity moved to Tier 1 in unholy<br />
Virulence moved to Tier 2 in unholy<br />
Blood-Caked Blade: Your autoattacks have a 5/10/15% chance to cause Blood-Caked Strike, which hits for 50% weapon damage times the number of your diseases on the target. (Was 60%)<br />
Night of the Dead: Hitting a target with Plague Strike or Scourge Strike reduces the cooldown of your next Raise Dead and your next Army of the Dead by 30 sec / 1 min. This effect stacks up to 5 times. (was bugged to be 1 min for both ranks)<br />

What it'll do is make it so a lower-ranked spell costs the same mana to cast as a full-ranked one, without making it prohibitively expensive at the level when you get it. On the other hand, it evens out some of the racial imbalances, since not all races have the same base intellect. Although I doubt people use base stats as a reason to pick races, and I hope that the gnome's 10% int buff doesn't mean everything costs 10% more.<br />

<br />
You failed to mention the higher ranks of Holy Light in WOTLK... in order for this to be a nerf we would have to have a base mana pool of around 6500 which is not happening...this will be good for the higher ranks as for example Beacon of Light was 1900 mana but now will be significantly less at level 80. (Assume we have a 5500 base mana pool, it would be 1650 mana instead of 1900) <br />

Yes it will suck for starting at 70 that our spells are a bit higher than what we were used too with TBC but in the end game it will be better than what we were anticipating, mana cost wise.</div></div><hr />

With a base mana of 4098, that makes Holy Light 11 now cost 1188 mana instead of 840. Couple that with the fact all downranking is gone and that it a fairly crushing nerf.<br />

<br />
That's a relief then. I thought it sounded kind of higher than I expected. I heard it was just your mana out of gear. So it's that less the mana from your natural int? <br />
<br />
Although that means the mana cost is still increasing by 16, I wouldn't fret about that. Although now I kind of wonder if Light's Grace is worth having.</div></div><hr />

Ok this is probably a silly question but which one of the above is the feral druid weapon - do we just go for the rogue dagger and pray for a non-caster off hand... or have i missed something.

Exactly, but isn't haste also worth gemming for a rogue?<br />
<br />
Plus; the epic BoP gems will probably be available much earlier on in progression than the Epic BoE gems, giving increased gains for that period of time. Your gaining 11 stats per gem until epic boe gems are available. I'm not sure where the Epic BoE gems are from though we can assume they won't be available right at the start of WotLK.<br />
<br />
Also we save gold Vs enchanting. Ring enchants cost money. BoP gems will probably be cheaper than the BoE alternatives.<br />
<br />
Finally, we'll probably also get some BoP neck/ring/ or something; if so, Enchanting will be falling way behind.<br />

What planet are you from? ;D<br />

Warriors always have 100 rage, from level 1 to 80. So Mortal Strike costing 30 rage is already always 30% of a warrior's base rage, is it not? ;)</div></div><hr />

I don't see why they don't simply completely remove the lower rank spells though, sure there's the checkbox. But what purpose does casting low level spells have at all now?<br />
Rogues don't want to do abilities that do 2-4 damage, why would casters? At a higher cost even.</div></div><hr />

Because it wasn't about doing damage, it was about afflicting the slow debuff and trying to proc Frostbite. Lower ranks had a much shorter cast time meaning it was much easier to cast given spell pushback and mind numbing poisons et al.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the latest WotLK beta push, we made a large change to the mana cost of spells. All player spells now cost a percentage of base mana rather than a fixed cost. Base mana is a special value determined by the player’s level and class, regardless of any effects or items that increase intellect. It is the size of a player’s mana pool if the player has zero intellect.<br />
<br />
This change was made primarily to prevent downranking, as it's a technique that was never quite intended. Rather than continue to find ways to penalize players for casting low-rank spells, we decided to essentially make doing so obsolete. If rank 5 and rank 6 of a spell cost the same amount of mana, but rank 6 does more damage/healing, then there is no reason to consider casting rank 5.<br />
<br />
So, each spell line (eg. Frostbolt, Shadowbolt, Greater Heal, Rejuvenation, etc.) has a fixed percentage of base mana that it costs for most of its ranks. That means each time a player gains a level the cost will go up some. The percentages were picked to attempt to keep the costs relatively similar to what they are currently in World of Warcraft. For most spells, that percentage will drop some when the player receives their highest-rank spell in existing Burning Crusade content. This was done to better fit the existing cost curve, and to keep the mana cost for level 70 players as close as possible to existing costs. Level 70 characters will see most of their maximum rank spells change in cost slightly up or down, but not by significant amounts.<br />
<br />
We anticipate there being some balance concerns due to this change, and our development staff will be ready to implement new spells, abilities, or talents to resolve those issues as the testing process continues.&quot;<br />

<br />
This is the only good thing I see about the whole down-ranking thing. I don't play a shaman, but this seems like it would be a huge problem.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the down-ranking of healing in raids seems to be pretty crucial for mana conservation, so that's a huge kick in the nuts to PvEers. <br />
<br />
Also, I think if the intention of this change was to prevent Rank 1 de-stealths, they are really missing the point of stealth classes. Rank 1 still costs mana and AOE spells are rarely cheap, eventually you'll run out. If you're a stealth class, you should be in tune with the 'waiting game', i.e. wait until they stop casting their AoE, in the meanwhile, they're just hurting themselves. This is a completely unnecessary change, IMO.</div></div><hr />

Lol, didn't know that there are rogues who actually gets a vigor. That's like the most useless talent in the game? ::) Anyway, base energy would still be at &quot;100&quot;. Isn't base mana, a mana w/o abosolutely anything beside what you got for levels? That means no talents, base int, etc. <br />

QFT, I honestly am baffled by this change.<br />
I understand some spells getting the change but not ALL spells... like someone already mentioned rank 1 ES is a god send for enh shamans... now we have to blow a insane amount of mana just to stop u from casting... with LIMITED mana pools... not to mention the nerf to shamanistic rage so we get ALOT less mana from that alone... horrible change in the eyes of a enh shaman and like someone else already said... Healers downrank to conserve mana thats what separates the noobs from the pros... and now everyone will just seem ordinary at best</div></div><hr />

Your base mana is your mana before Intellect, gear, buffs, talents. ETC. Here's what base mana is for each class at level 70.<br />

Mage | 2241<br />
Druid | 2370<br />
Warlock | 2615<br />

BASE mana, that is the mana you have WITHOUT ANY INTELLECT. Its not the mana you have without gear, because even without gear you have some intellect. Base mana is roughly around 3k, give or take 800. A level 70 paladin has 2953 base mana. <br />

<br />
however something like this is only going to hurt casters that much more in PvP, so it will be interesting to see how this shakes things up. also hurt big would be tankadins and downranking healers, but i suppose there will be less 'know-your-class' skill and more rotation / teamwork healing in raids, meaning a slightly less amount of individual skill combined with coordination.</div></div><hr />

Frostbolt rank 1 is a vital part of the frostmage pvp. As for paladins nothing is better to spam then Flash of Light rank 2 when you are oom. And for you that have played a paladin, once you are oom you are oom. So this is a life saver. <br />
<br />
<br />
The difference now though is that mana regeneration is in realtime, there is no more waiting the extra seconds to see 300 or so mana add to your pool, it's in real time so getting back to the flash heal of the highest rank won't take as long anymore. <br />
<br />
I never downrank, I think it's weak and I'm a top paladin healer in an end game sunwell guild so I don't really see the fuss about it all. I personally like the changes because it has greatly reduced the static costs of end game WOTLK spells. (Beacon was 1900, will be around 1200 mana now with this change for example).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Again, it's not about how powerful the spell is in regards to rank 1 Frostbolt. You cast it for the slow effect and chance to freeze a target. Atm a frost specced mage has around 1s cast time on a rank 1 frostbolt, highest rank it's 2.5s. The difference there is you are standing still for longer, making you an easier target, and you have much more time now to have your spell interupted. By the time the cast is complete, you've probably been caught by the mob your kiting.</div></div><hr />

Looks like Stoicism took a righteous hit from the nerfbat there. Missing on spells isn't exactly a big problem for Paladins, and resistances even less. People weren't exactly taking that talent for it's stun resistance, it was the dispel resistance that was the big part of it and now they've taking it away.<br />
Well, it just further solidifies PvP Holy Paladins taking Sheath of Light.</div></div><hr />

Silent nerf, second last line of the paladin changes. &gt;:(<br />

About Stoicism taking a hit, the 30% chance to 'not fail' most likely means that we have talents that negate the 30% dispel resistance on spells that all other classes have. Cleanse would only have the base chance to fail, and not friggin 35-40%.</div></div><hr />
