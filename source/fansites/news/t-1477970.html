Blizzcon 2014<br />
It seems the Blizzcon Virtual Ticket page (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/streamingtermsofconditions.html) recently had some updates to change the title and header to include 2014 rather than 2013. Assuming this change isn't an accident, it could mean that Blizzcon 2014 is definitely planned and we should hear an announcement about it very soon. <br />
<br />
Just keep in mind that we haven't heard anything official yet, and this could indeed be an accident. <br />
<br />

<br />
Blizzcon has been announced in February or March for the past few years. <br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
New GPUs from AMD are here, at least on paper. Finding any AMD GPUs is hard now, as is finding some of the Nvidia GPUs. Prices for many GPUs went up due to demand and the older GPUs being discontinued. <br />
<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/march/ssdgraph.gif) are stable, with most SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. <br />
<br />
The Haswell CPUs (http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1) run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Death Knight and Monk decks for Hearthstone? More heroes for Heroes of the Storm?<br />

The title changed, the header in the h1 changed, and the flash date is set by some JS on the page that is manually written, not auto updated. The page still said 2013 in January.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if Blizzard will continue to stick to 2 year expansions. Probably should if they want to keep announcing games at an October/November Blizzcon. Kind of in an awkward place where they might be able to pump one out sooner if desired, but it might not coincide perfectly with Blizzcon and the long beta process is totally necessary imo. The current model is perfect. They announced WoD after 5.4 had been out for awhile and we were fully ready to see what's next. I'm not sure you can really put a dollar value on expansion announcements when the time is right, but it's gotta be a huge boost to sales when they can nail it like they did. After how successful giving Hearthstone to top streamers was, I'm sure Blizzard values hype building more than ever</div></div><hr />

They basicly only announced WoD last year. They already anounced the D3 expansion and the fact they where working on HotS before Blizzcon.<br />
So they probably will announce LotV, and talk about the stuff that's comming up for WoW, HotS and maybe D3 and Hearthstone and more details about the WoW movie.<br />
Also they probably will have the WCS global finals and some tournaments for WoW,HotS and Hearthstone.<br />

<br />
WoD should be out before then, there most likely wont be anything to showcase for the next wow expansion, so that title will be pretty slim on news/info. unless of course theyre cooking up a warcraft rts, which i highly doubt.<br />
<br />
D3 expansion will be out this month, which i would also suspect will be too soon for them to have any juicy news/info about.<br />
<br />
really the only thing i can think of will be the last SC2 expansion and maybe some HoTS info. while i love me some SC2, the only thing im actually interested in will be the release date of it. i dont play the game competitively, or regularly, enough to be concerned about tweaks/changes to the units and gameplay.<br />

<br />
Wrong, it costs them money to make Blizzcon. They might get some cash out of it but it does cost them money. If they clearly don't care for players as you claim, they wouldn't even hold it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also I doubt there will be a 2014 Blizzcon. Doesn't seem very likely.</div></div><hr />

Possible announcements: SCII 3rd Exp, Hearthstone 1st Exp, D3 plans, WoW Plans and WoW Movie Trailer. Oh and some cool stuff since its 10th wow anniversary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assuming WoD is out by then (Blizzcon is usually in October/November, and they are speculating a fall release) we could see a preview for the first major WoW patch.<br />
<br />
As far as other franchises go, Diablo 3 might have new features planned (unlikely to talk about another expansion yet). On the SC2 front it would seem like a fairly good time to finally showcase LoTV. Hearthstone card expansion, and Heroes of the Storm might be close to release at that point then. The Warcraft movie will probably actually be legitimately previewed this time as well.<br />
<br />
Finally, while complete speculation.. we might actually get a preview or a small glimpse at Titan or what it is finally.<br />
<br />
There is plenty of room for a Blizzcon that isn't necessarily WoW focused. If WoW is released in September or October, and Blizzcon is in November they could easily preview the 6.1 or 6.2 patches. They don't need a new WoW expansion to make Blizzcon exciting. They have plenty of franchises now to make Blizzcon fun, and frankly any information is fun.</div></div><hr />

Are you entirely sure on that or are they making money?, they might not have a huge profit on it but they most certainly are making money and probably a small profit on it with all those tickets they can sell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoD should be out before then, there most likely wont be anything to showcase for the next wow expansion, so that title will be pretty slim on news/info. unless of course theyre cooking up a warcraft rts, which i highly doubt.<br />
<br />
D3 expansion will be out this month, which i would also suspect will be too soon for them to have any juicy news/info about.<br />
<br />
really the only thing i can think of will be the last SC2 expansion and maybe some HoTS info. while i love me some SC2, the only thing im actually interested in will be the release date of it. i dont play the game competitively, or regularly, enough to be concerned about tweaks/changes to the units and gameplay.<br />
<br />
so sorry to sound like a debbie downer but it just doesnt seem to really give off any good vibes<br />
<br />
or it might be all about WoD very close to its release if the realease will be in Decemeber :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The middle of an expansion does present an opportunity to do something totally different but we have a lot of established Warlords to kill off. Still doesn't mean we won't get multiple raid instances again. I'm thinking one of those will be an arakkoa raid.</div></div><hr />

2. If it's later (Oct or Nov) and Blizz DOES manage to get WoD out by Sept/Oct it may not be probable, but it's possible they could announce the next expansion. TBC, WotLK, and Cata were all announced 15 to 16 months before their release. Again, not likely, but not impossible. /shrug</div></div><hr />

Nope there is an actual core game expansion that probably will be announced this year. Don't know if you're intrested in SC2 if not then it could be like the 2010 blizzcon for you.</div></div><hr />

Well duh... From $39.99 to $49.99. From $59.99 to $69.99. Now an increase on the Blizz Tickets. Im betting they will increase the virtual ticket from $39.99 to $50 or $60. This is BS. I love my WoW. I love my game. But its just too much when theyre trying to just milk us, and not give us much in return. Half-assery is what theyve been doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we're lucky they might reveal a screenshot of an eyelash of the new Tauren model. <br />
<br />
Maybe reveal some new weapon skins, like 10 new color variations of Gorehowl!<br />
<br />
<br />
They might even flash a powerpoint of some patch notes relating to another change they're making to Kara. You know, but only as a joke to mess with people because it's just a quick fun thing to do and they have nothing better to be doing!<br />
<br />
<br />
I imagine it will be a few model reveals with a little more shading and muscle definition, and animations that will be hid by helmets. Some previews of challenge mode gear that will be removed at the end of the expansion. Previews of their next 10 store mounts. The end boss reveal of a void infused still old god corrupted Garrosh. I'd almost be willing to bet that Metzen will host this Blizzcon dressed head to toe as Thrall with make-up and everything, and will do the entire thing in his incredibly awesome orc voice.. where he will announce that he has been cast as the main character of the upcoming Warcraft movie. <br />

<br />
When I look to unicorn setup is just blah! PSU is just oo much even with OC on CPU and GPU you don't need more then SeaSonic 550w PSU and it cost less... Noctua HD-D14 is best solution for air cooler but for ppl who don't want big mountin in mid of case they could go with U14 (single tower from noctua)...<br />
<br />
Asus mobo are too pricey go with something like AsRock z87-extreme3 or something down that lines.... <br />
<br />
You don't need 840 PRO for a bit more $ you can buy Evo 250GB and you won't even see the difference...<br />
I saw WD Black in most of this setup's that is funny if u have SSD(any modern PC need to have him) go with WD Blue or something from Segate... DVD/RW no one use anymore. but for 20$ you can buy cheapest one...<br />
<br />
CM coolers are sh't! Go for noctua or if u rich go with AIO Cooler like Corsair H100i or H110(Be aware there is no much cases that can fit this rad)</div></div><hr />

Instead lets listen trust some stark raving anonymous hater/fan-boy lunatics on some fan site stating opinions as facts.....more credible...sheesh...:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
<br />
Their standards and their legacy?<br />
<br />
Where was that forum post from a year ago talking about never selling power-leveling?<br />
<br />
Or any post they've ever done about wanting to get content out faster?<br />
<br />
They've clearly always been completely honest and upfront. <br />
<br />
It's not like a multi-billion dollar company would have any reason to lie. <br />
<br />
I doubt a few lies here and there would disappoint shareholders as long as the money keeps rolling in.</div></div><hr />

If you even consider about great sound you need to go with sound card not with already mobo sound something like asus ROG line bringing...</div></div><hr />

Oh, if that's so. Please find me an album called &quot;Itse Valtiaat - Kun mikään ei riitä&quot; available for download.<br />
What's that? You couldn't find one? What a suprise.. you can't find everything from the internet!<br />

It all depends on your internet I can download 20 gigs in like 30 minutes so its not a big deal, and I will agree sure there may be some things you can't find that are very obscure, but for me I don't have enough stuff on CD's to care all that much about, everything I have is on my external that I care about, and my OEM Windows 7 and 8 are on a USB drive along with all my computer drivers. I just have no need personally and most people probably don't either for a DVD drive anymore, if you want a good DVD drive its more like 40-50$ and to me I would much rather put that towards a better component.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since the Expansion DVD installers aren't compatible with each other that method of install isn't a recommended method of install.<br />
<br />
You'll actually end up with patching errors as well as having to re-download a lot more then 20 GB.</div></div><hr />
