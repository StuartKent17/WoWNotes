<br />
If I order the BlizzCon 2015 Virtual Ticket, will I receive the commemorative BlizzCon 2015 in-game goodies?<br />
Yes, Virtual Ticket holders will also receive commemorative BlizzCon 2015 in-game goodies for a variety of Blizzard games (details to be announced at a later date). The goodies will be linked to the Battle.net account used to purchase or redeem the Virtual Ticket, and will be available in-game after the show begins. Stay tuned for more information.<br />
<br />
*NEW* Once I purchase my Virtual Ticket, how do I pre-purchase an optional BlizzCon 2015 Goody Bag?<br />
Once you’ve completed your Virtual Ticket purchase or redeemed your Virtual Ticket code, log in to the Blizzard Gear Store (http://gear.blizzard.com) using the same Battle.net account. Look for the Goody Bag callout on the front page, or click BlizzCon 2015 in the top navigation bar, where you’ll be able to pre-purchase (limit 1 per Virtual Ticket and Battle.net account).<br />
<br />
Please note that BlizzCon 2015 Goody Bag *supplies are limited*, and buying a Virtual Ticket does *not* guarantee that you’ll be able to also buy a Goody Bag. Goody Bag orders will be shipped closer to the start of BlizzCon. For more information, see the FAQ.<br />
<br />
Will replays of Virtual Ticket content be available after BlizzCon is over?<br />
Yes! Anyone with a Virtual Ticket will be able to access on-demand replays of the Main and Panel Stage streams for up to two weeks after the end of the event. Replays of the eSports events will also be available for free.<br />
<br />
Will you be hosting a BlizzCon online merchandise sale this year for Virtual Ticket buyers? How will I access the sale?<br />
Yes—we’re setting aside a stash of BlizzCon merchandise for BlizzCon attendees and Virtual Ticket holders to be sold in an online merchandise sale scheduled to take place October 16 through November 8, 2015.<br />
<br />
After purchasing or redeeming a code for a Virtual Ticket, your Battle.net account will automatically be flagged to get access to the merchandise sale when it begins. Visit www.blizzcon.com closer to the sale for more information.<br />
<br />
We’re also planning a post-BlizzCon sale that’s open to the public after show concludes—we’ll have more details to share at a later date. Please note that items purchased in all of these sales will be shipped from the U.S., so international shipping rates and other fees may apply.<br />
<br />
How do I order the Virtual Ticket?<br />
You can order the Virtual Ticket directly through the Battle.net Shop (http://blizz.ly/1NF9MPj). Be sure to make your purchase on the Battle.net account you wish to use to watch the show, receive the in-game goodies, and access the merchandise sale. Also make sure you have a valid, updated payment method associated with your Battle.net account. If you do not yet have a Battle.net account, you can create one for free on the Battle.net website (https://us.battle.net/account/creation/tos.html).<br />
<br />
In what languages will the Virtual Ticket Internet stream be available?<br />
The BlizzCon 2015 Virtual Ticket Internet stream and DIRECTV broadcast will be available in English only.<br />
<br />
Free eSports streams will be available in multiple languages through a variety of external channels—visit www.blizzcon.com closer to the show to find out if localized streaming eSports coverage is available in your preferred language.<br />
<br />
In which regions is the Virtual Ticket available for purchase?<br />
The BlizzCon Virtual Ticket is available in the Americas, Europe, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia (pricing and availability varies by region). Keep in mind the Virtual Ticket stream will be available only in English.<br />
<br />
What are the system requirements and minimum bandwidth requirements to view the live stream?<br />
We’ll have more information on the system requirements and minimum bandwidth requirements to view the stream closer to the event.<br />
<br />
Do I need to purchase a Virtual Ticket if I’ve already purchased a ticket to attend BlizzCon in person?<br />
Live BlizzCon attendees also get a Virtual Ticket with their BlizzCon ticket purchase. BlizzCon ticket purchasers should have already received a code (one per ticket purchased) which can be used to unlock the Virtual Ticket, in-game goodies, and merchandise sale access on a single Battle.net account. These codes were emailed directly to the BlizzCon ticket purchaser, so check with the person who bought your ticket if you haven’t yet received your code.<br />
<br />
I plan to purchase the BlizzCon 2015 Pay Per View event through DIRECTV. Do I need to purchase the Virtual Ticket separately to also watch online?<br />
For those who choose the option to purchase the BlizzCon 2015 DIRECTV Pay Per View (coming soon), the Virtual Ticket Internet stream will be included with your order. After ordering through DIRECTV, you will receive an email containing a code that will grant one Battle.net account access to the Virtual Ticket Internet stream, the BlizzCon 2015 in-game goodies, and online merchandise sale. You will be able to redeem your code here (https://www.battle.net/code)—just make sure to redeem the code using the Battle.net account on which you wish to receive the in-game goodies.<br />
<br />
Note that the DIRECTV Pay Per View broadcast is not included with purchases of the Virtual Ticket made through the Battle.net Shop. More information on the DIRECTV BlizzCon 2015 Pay Per View event, including how to order through DIRECTV, will be available at a later date.<br />

Patch 6.2.2 Release Date<br />
As you might have seen in the latest update to the 6.2.2 PTR Patch Notes, our current plan is to release Patch 6.2.2 on September 1.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that this release date is not set in stone, as we are continuing to iron out bugs with 6.2.2’s content, including some related to enabling flight in Draenor. That said, we are optimistic that we’ll be able to have everything ready by then, so we wanted to share the current plan. We know many players -- us included! -- are excited to take to the skies above Tanaan Jungle and the rest of the Draenor continent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.2.2 Change Clarifications<br />
Hail, hero of Azeroth! The time has come to acknowledge/address faction imbalance!<br />
We recognize there's a problem. It's why we've been nerfing the Human racial and implementing things like Merc Mode. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634045580503678976))<br />
merc mode doesn't help Horde. It helps ally queue times. You stated so yourself! <br />
It does help Horde, by giving Horde more people to play with.<br />
Maybe...we'll see how that plays out. Horde rated needs bodies, which means people actually on the red side.<br />
Also - and I couldn't say this an hour ago - we're buffing several Horde racials. (aa (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634080044432752640))<br />
<br />
Would it not be fair to give a discount or maybe even a free faction change when massive racials changes happen like this?<br />
The goal is not to push everyone over to Horde, just shore up some Horde racials that are underperforming. I'll ask about it, though. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634081794107682817))<br />
and doing it in the current season is totally fine.<br />
<br />
That would be underperforming in PVP Josh? as the top 10 progressed PVE guilds are all Horde.<br />
Yes, in PvP. The racial changes have little to no real PvE impact. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634083547221876736))<br />
maybe I'm just being cynical but I don't think 30s on Rocket Jump cd is going to have a major impact on the ladder.<br />
To be honest with the listed changes I don't believe anyone is doing it to be goblin. Even if they're cool.<br />
Sure. I also don't think that another 5% on Hardiness or Voodoo Shuffle are going to have any noticeable effect.<br />
With a majority of comps relying on stuns to kill or silences blood elves and orcs will def rise to the occasion.<br />
Yeah, maybe. IDK I still think Stoneform or Shadowmeld are really strong and easily on par. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634086333095391232))<br />
<br />
Why not just get rid of all active racials and let people decide what to play based on looks/friends and not fotm.<br />
We like racials. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634084398950805504))<br />
We still like the actives, and disagree that they cause big problems (as long as they're tuned appropriately) (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634084398950805504))<br />
I guess issue is many horde actives offensive, all ally actives defensive. Some horde actives good in pve, not so much ally.<br />
Maybe. That's an interesting point. I'll bring it up. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634085331881431040))<br />
<br />
Will these 10% more 10% less in pvp be nerfs or will they deal the same as now in pvp. Wording is not clear.<br />
+10% base, then -10% in PvP. So a very slight (~1%) nerf to those abilities, but a buff to Mind Flay. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634085162926518272))<br />
<br />
hey can you clarify the feral damage changes. does that mean it's unchanged in pvp?<br />
Buffed by 20% baseline, then reduced by 20% in PvP, so a very slight (~4%) nerf . (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634088240509616128))<br />
<br />
Would have been much better to have the cast time removed from War Stomp. Still suspectable to push back and DPS loss.<br />
I don't think a 0.5 second cast is too much to ask for a 3-second AOE stun (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634102424622473217))<br />
But a 3-second silence gets a pass?<br />
Stuns are significantly more powerful in more situations than silences. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634104466510376960))<br />
<br />
Bring back the strong Will of Forsaken!<br />
WotF is exactly the same as it was in Mists when everybody was undead (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634105005511999488))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please keep in mind that this release date is not set in stone, as we are continuing to iron out bugs with 6.2.2’s content, including some related to enabling flight in Draenor. That said, we are optimistic that we’ll be able to have everything ready by then, so we wanted to share the current plan. We know many players -- us included! -- are excited to take to the skies above Tanaan Jungle and the rest of the Draenor continent.&quot;<br />

Those aren't nerfs, it's just offsetting the PVE buffs. Basically the % increases only apply in PVE situations so the PVP damage you do currently will be the same.</div></div><hr />

What the anti-flyers seem to be immune to understanding is that those of us that love flying (and no, not for convenience, for the love of flying in itself) sort of want it to be part of the game as we play it.<br />

There's a way to guarantee that you're not playing (and paying for) the game until what you want is in the game. Just saying. It's my strategy going forward, at least.<br />

Yes and no. There will always be a person who has an issue with something. That can't be avoided. But Blizzard's policy in the past has typically been to not give a release date for patches until the week of. That's probably not always been the case, but Blizzard used to be notorious for not giving release dates, and it went pretty okay for them.</div></div><hr />

which alliance racial has only been in for 9 months? The only one that's making people cry is the human racial... which has been the same for years. Every man for himself DID NOT come with wod. It has been in the game for YEARS<br />

well, considering how much money bliz raked in with faction changes, can you blame them for trying to get people to change back? all they have to do is keep shifting the power from one side to the other and the cash registers keep ching chinging! Like a god damned money tree ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Virtual ticket comes with every perk of actually going to Blizzcon......except actually going to Blizzcon (physically).<br />
<br />
So yes, you get Murkidan and all the other ingame goodies for their franchises.<br />
<br />
On topic: I totally splurged for that messenger bag. My current laptop bag/messenger bag is falling apart, felt like a good replacement XD. It's a bit smaller than mine but I hardly actually use mine for the laptop itself anyway, lol.<br />

<br />
<br />
Don't forget The Human Spirit! They had (maybe still have?) increased spirit!<br />
<br />
But the controvercial racial in Vanilla, and most of tBC, was Will of the Forsaken. It used to not share any sort of CD with a PVP trinket and gave Undead about 10 seconds of pure immunity from Fears, MCs, and Horror effects as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Access to view live streams of Blizzcon (multiple channels, so there's various angles and whatnot) along with the ability to watch them on demand for up to 2 weeks after.<br />
<br />
You also gain access to any in-game goodies that come with an actual blizzcon ticket (such as the Murkidan pet).</div></div><hr />

Druid (Forums / Skills / Talent Calculator)<br />
General<br />
Thrash in Cat Form now deals 10% more damage.<br />
Feral<br />
Rake now deals 20% more damage. In PvP combat, Rake now deals 20% less damage.<br />
Rip now deals 20% more damage. In PvP combat, Rip now deals 20% less damage.<br />
<br />
Really? Our feral already beats every other fing class in DPS - and they get a buff? Are you kissing me? :D Bizzard, really.<br />
<br />
Sounds like your guild has some sub par dps.<br />
<br />
Also please don't use Noxxic for... Anything really. <br />
<br />
<br />
So buff Feral damage to compensate for the idiots who don't know how to play the rotation? Wow, just wow.<br />
<br />
If you want an accurate depiction of the state of feral, look on warcraft logs: warcraftlogs.com/statistics/8</div></div><hr />

To those that will say that i'm crazy or dumb, look: Increase 20% of 100, and you increase more 20, remaining 120. Now, take out 20% of 120 and will remain 96. Damn, nerf locks !</div></div><hr />

Still think ferals are fine.<br />
<br />
If you're using Noxxic for information, that's probably why your Feral is kicking everyone's ass. Terrible resource. <br />
Feral is towards the bottom of the barrel currently. Look at Warcraft Logs. The only classes they're beating are Glad Warriors and Surv. Hunters.</div></div><hr />

Really? That's interesting, since it didn't even exist until WotLK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think it did Horror effects (which there were very few of at the time). But as bad as WotF was for PvP balance, I saw a lot more issues with the Dwarven Priest only racial of Fear Ward in PvE. It was ridiculously useful with the huge number AoE fears that wiped aggro from the tank while feared. Combine this with the fact that one priest could have it up 100% of the time on the tank (this part was nerfed before it was shared with the Horde), and you had a truly godly ability.</div></div><hr />
