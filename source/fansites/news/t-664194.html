General<br />
More character slots might be added but maybe not for Cataclysm. <br />
You might be able to reorder the characters on your character selection screen at some point.<br />
There are some ideas for &quot;mentoring&quot; to let people of varied levels play together without powerleveling. Things like downleveling yourself to play with them is a possibility but it might not be for Cataclysm.<br />
Character visual customization is something they would like to adress, but they don't really know what the right solution is. They have a few ideas in mind and might do something about it soon. <br />
Oceanic servers will get their own maintenance time at some point. <br />
Dancing is still in the work and the animation is working on them, there is still some work to do to make it a real feature.<br />
<br />
Races<br />
Race changes will be available shortly after Faction changes. There is no point in not allowing that since you can't really prevent people with multiple accounts to play both side on PvP servers anyway.<br />
All races will have updated racials with Cataclysm, they should be similar to what the Goblins have. (Increased health/mana potion effects, etc ...)<br />
<br />
Guild Leveling System<br />
The idea behind the guild leveling system is to make people want to be in guilds and make people feel better about being in a guild. The goal is to take that feature and make it the best they can. (Guild Talent Trees, etc ...)<br />
You will be able to create guild heirlooms with the new guild leveling system, you can buy profession plans and anyone in your guild can wear that item, it will scale with level. <br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Armorsmith and Weaponsmith specialization really felt like the Blacksmith was limited by his choice, that's why it was ignored in Wrath of the Lich King. Ultimately it's better if the player can craft more stuff instead of just being able to craft 2H swords or whatever.<br />
Herbs and Ore Nodes will be reitemized with the revamp.<br />
<br />
Player vs. Player<br />
XP in Battlegrounds need to be fixed because there is a lot of XP leeching in the 71-80 Brackets. Once it's fixed, it will be improved across the board. <br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
You can't get Frostmourne because it would take control of your soul. Frostmourne would be playing your character, not you. The weapon has an unique fate and the encounter is going to be mega. <br />
There won't be any option to do Onyxia at level 60 anymore after the revamp in 3.2.2.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm<br />
There isn't any plan to prevent ganking in the contested zones of Azeroth, even with flying mounts available here. This is just part of being on a PvP server.<br />
They can't spoil the Thrall / Garrosh storyline, but with the cataclysm raging everywhere, what do you think the world's mightiest shaman would need to do? <br />
Northrend and Outland won't really be affected by the Cataclysm but some of the areas will be updated for the expansion. For example, you will be able to level up Archeology in Outland. <br />
<br />
Itemization<br />
The 5 second rule might be removed with the changes made to spirit but there isn't any final decision about that.<br />
There is no plans to prevent Paladins and Shamans from using cloth, but there were some discussions to limit it somehow.<br />
Armor Penetration is removed from the gear but not from the game. There are plans to reintroduce it in another way to allow players to kill plate wearers. (Armor Penetration talents, etc ...)<br />
Spirit is going to be a healer stat only, it won't exist on DPS Gear. Healers need it to regen and other casters don't use it at all. (Other casters will use Intellect for Spell Power)<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
They won't add a new class in Cataclysm, they have to be very careful about adding more classes and do not want tons of them.<br />
The philosophy about pure DPS classes is still the same, they don't want hybrid to do everything they can do. The elevated hybrid DPS in Wrath of the Lich King is in a &quot;good place&quot; now.<br />
<br />
Classes - Pets<br />
In Patch 3.3, pets will scale of all of your stats and allow buffs from raid encounters to affect them. <br />
In Patch 3.3, there will be changes to make sure that pets can't be hit by AOEs from bosses but others (PvP) will be able to affect them. <br />
Pets classes might get a &quot;move to this location&quot; command for their pet, long cooldown abilities that let your pet teleport to you to get out of trouble. This would be good feature since developers can't make pet AI as smart as a player. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
There isn't any immediate plan to give feral druids a legendary, casters are next on the list. <br />
Trolls and Worgens Druids will get their own bear, cat, travel, and aquatic forms.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter <br />
Hunters might be able to choose the talent tree of their pet to let them pick the pet that looks best to them. Zhevra is a possibility for Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage <br />
Night Elves Mages have been added because it sounded pretty cool to have Elves using arcane when they shouldn't be anymore.<br />
Mage abilities like Molten Armor will be changed to use other stats since mages won't have Spirit anymore. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue<br />
They want to see rogues use more daggers, they're THE rogue weapon and we don't see enough of them. In Patch 3.2.2 they might add an assassination talent to make daggers more attractive.<br />
One of the plans for cataclysm is to take a lot of the early subtlety tree and make it passive for the class. The unattractive stuff will be taken out to let you get the cool talents.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman<br />
Sacrificying the group utility of mana tide totem to give it a much better regen is a possibility. <br />
Enhancement Shamans do not use INT anymore and will be given talents to not need it just like Retribution Paladins. <br />
Enhancement Shamans having to run in and out of melee ranges to redrop totem and sacrifice DPS is a legitimate problem, they don't want enhancement to have to run out like that. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock<br />
Warlock's survavibility wasn't really good at the start of Wrath of the Lich King, but they're in a pretty good place right now. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior<br />
Arms lost their iconic ability when Mortal Strike was given to more classes. They need to find a new ability to fill that niche or make Arms' MS the &quot;ultimate&quot; mortal strike.</div></div><hr />

I think the unexpected is what drives a good story... If they do it right they can for example imply that the Night Elves are desperate, (they did just lose their cities in Ashenvale and Darkshore...) besides the world being torn asunder and whatnot. Besides, if there are already demons sieging the world, the most obvious downside of arcane magic is lost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: &quot;Guild halls is something we've talked about. We have to decide what we're going to spend our time on and mean most to the players. It's cool, but as far as benefits to the players there's not a lot there that'll benefit you. We want you in the cities doing things, not in an instance seprated from the rest of the world. it's not high on the priority list.&quot;<br />

What does that have to do with changing races? The only thing that happens when you change your race is your looks and your racials. Nothing more.</div></div><hr />

That I$ the point Baaadum.<br />
As far as Blizzard is concerned, that is exactly the point: <br />
The number of people who will pay $10, $15, $25, or whatever, to have a lv 80-85 Goblin or Worgen (presumably while retaining all the achievements earned on their current main) rather than spend weeks leveling a new character that starts with nothing from 1 to 85.<br />

<br />
Seriously? I'm not sure if this is aimed at PvP or PvE but juggernaut and bladestorm are pretty niche in my opinion. Blizzard dug themselves a hole here, PvP shouldn't be decided on who has MS and who doesn't but it has basically come down to having MS or incredible burst. And unfortunately, a lot of classes have both. And warrior tears are pretty ridiculous since they put out an incredible amount of damage right now with their Overpower MS, it needs to get removed or changed in some way.</div></div><hr />

You do know that several spells of druids ARE Arcane, what makes them not use another type of it? The Fire and Frost spells are merely an example they can use<br />
<br />
For f'ck sake, World of Azeroth is CRASHING down, do you think people won't take other paths to try and do their best to avoid that happening? Or are you a person who just shrugs and walks off?<br />

Honestly, they please no camps by doing this. Lorenerds are not satisfied by this. Tauren rogues are not pleased by it.<br />

I think they should go 100% or not at all. Allow all race/class combos. You'll please all the people who want to make retarded race/class combos. While lorenerds would be upset anyways no matter what degree you take it to. If you allow troll druids no reason not to allow tauren rogues or troll warlocks.<br />

While in game the type is classified arcane. Typically in lore when something is referred to arcane or fel magics or whatever they usually refer to the source of where that magic comes from. Confusing. I didn't write the lore.</div></div><hr />

True, but also think of that even though the Highborne were the &quot;Non Elune&quot; users of arcane, and other forbidden spell. Sure, the elves that does become mages will be shunned, but ... What can you do about that, if the elves does take their pride and stuff it to be useful with this incoming disaster, they took that way. Just cause general populace of Elves have their pride, doesn't mean all have it.<br />
(Talking Lorewise, not gameplay wise now.)<br />
<br />
Lore sure took a hit this time, but then also remember, that the lore is still being spun, things changing daily after all in it.</div></div><hr />

i was always under the impression that the blasted lands look the way they do because the portal was destroyed in a giant explosion in the end of the warcraft 2 alliance campaign. i am also of the opinion that the only two times both sides of the portal were affected enough to be worth mentioning is when either portal is destroyed (which naturally affects the other side as well... it IS powerful magic at work) and when nerzhul caused draenor to be ripped apart by all the other portals he created on his side, which was even more apocalyptic than the collapse of the sunwell (which caused the maelstrom). i dont think the little earthshaking in &quot;cataclysm&quot; gets even close to either of these.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

night elven mages do make sense. we have had the shendralar in dire maul for ages. but they are not darnassian night elves, they are the only ancient highborne left, with the other major factions having been converted to naga and reorganized into what are now the blood elves. darnassian mages make no sense. they have died out, been expelled, and dont have a place in the storyline until those discrepancies are covered.<br />
<br />
i never understand how people always ignore such major parts of the story when they try to make a point. the full picture is there for a reason, and it shouldnt be ignored.<br />

im with you on this one. i somehow am becoming tired of this. i mean, when it really is the case that they dont care about lore at all then why dont they just leave it out completely, instead of making up all that bogus all the time. it destroys the atmosphere a bit more with every change, even though theres been almost nothing left since a long time.<br />

Oh I'm very fond of the lore.<br />
However, as you might have noticed, the timeline advanced between expansions. New events happen. <br />
There was lore explaining why night elves didn't have mages, since they started to despise arcane magic after they got Kalimdor blown to bits, now when the Cataclysm is about to happen, Highbornes (haven't read too much into this, how nor why) have found their place in the Night Elf society. There you go, Night Elf Mages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We killed Rag, he's back.<br />
<br />
We killed Nefarian, he's back<br />
<br />
We killed Ony, she's back.<br />
<br />
we killed kael, though he was merely set back.<br />
<br />
Only one who &quot;died&quot; and came back that makes sense is Kel'Thuzad, because of the phylactry stolen by Inigo Montoya.<br />
<br />
Not that i'm complaining, i loved vanilla so. =)<br />
<br />
I suspect you never grasped the concept on what happens to elementals and demons when &quot;killed&quot; on our plane. They don't typically actually die. The physical shell they inhabit is destroyed and they go back to their home plane. Thats Rag.<br />
<br />
Nef I got nothing for yet.<br />
<br />
Ony being back isnt a in-lore thing. If your gonna look at stright sotry, she's still dead. This revamp is effectivly OOC and just for fun.<br />
<br />
Kael, sure you defeated a dude who had collected a lot of power, stole one of his orbs and left. he simply recovered. Take his head next time =p<br />
<br />
though we did take Nefs and I still have nothing for him.</div></div><hr />

I'll soon have a server full of ten level 80's, one of each class. Obviously I will want to try out some of the new combos.<br />
The only option I would be left with is to race change which would be ridiculous to pay for with ten level 80's.<br />
<br />
<br />
It wont happen, one of the designers said (somewhat condescending) that he had never met anyone who had 10 LEGITIMATE characters on a server. <br />
<br />
(he probably means you have bank alts and other non valuable characters you can delete)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Lool, yes that would be very cool. All of Blasted lands would have been flooded and under water, but the opened the portal and all of the water drained out of the tub into Outland and flooded hellfire *g*<br />
<br />
I like that. Make it so!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumps</div><div class="date">2009-08-24, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and by the way for those who have read the book 'beyond the dark portal' it isn't such strange a thought cause when draenor was exploding and whatnot, turning into outland, khadgar rushed to the dark portal to close it and make sure it didn't affect azeroth. And as you already can see the link between outland and the blasted lands, the dieing of the land seeping trough the portal, it isn't that rare that it could affect outland. but we all know it doesn't since blizz said so. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
The portal is a stargate!<br />
<br />
Ever see the episode where a planet is being eaten by a blackhole and the gravity effects are bleeding through the stargate preventing them from closing it again? :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khanon</div><div class="date">2009-08-24, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I'm very fond of the lore.<br />
However, as you might have noticed, the timeline advanced between expansions. New events happen. <br />
There was lore explaining why night elves didn't have mages, since they started to despise arcane magic after they got Kalimdor blown to bits, now when the Cataclysm is about to happen, Highbornes (haven't read too much into this, how nor why) have found their place in the Night Elf society. There you go, Night Elf Mages.<br />
<br />
<br />
The lore in WoW is only really a history book of how things were in the past. Unlike games like LotRO, the &quot;future history&quot; of the World of Warcraft is very fluid and subject to social, geological, and political shifts and complete upheavals. This constant overuse of the phrase &quot;lollore&quot; or &quot;lorelol&quot; (whichever one may choose) has been stretched well beyond the point of even referring to the lore of the game. It's often used by people who just can't seem to be able to handle change. Now, there are some places where it's appropriate to use (such as Sargeras' Corruption...the changes to that were a serious lorelol...), but &quot;nowadays&quot; people use it as a way to poo-poo changes to the present, which is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Sorry, Cookie...most of that wasn't directed at you...your post was just a good jumping off point for my post.<br />
<br />
For Night Elf Mages (and I haven't gone all the way through the posts yet from the weekend, so please forgive me if it's been covered), but since Auberdine and Darkshore are going to be completely laid to waste, I wouldn't be all that far out of whack surprised to find Teldrassil completely laid to waste as well. Remember the chains of quests involving Morrowgrain and how we find that Fandral Staghelm has been growing the new World Tree without the blessings of the dragons (especially Ysera). The only vastly large ancient Night Elf city that remains intact is Eldre'Thalas...Dire Maul.<br />
<br />
If Malfurion is returning, perhaps he and the refugee night elves of Darnassus seek help from the Shen'dralar Night Elves? &quot;We'll use our sentinels and druids to rid Eldre'Thalas of all the ogres for good and all, as long as your prince has been put down permanently, the demon dog is sent back to the depths of hell, and we lay the troubled spirits of our ancestors to waste. What say you?&quot;<br />
<br />
This would be the most likely (though not only) cause for them rejoining the Darnassian Elves. It's also one I can easily wrap my head around as making sense.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned them being the only Highborne left (aside from the tainted Blood Elves)?? Let's not forget all the High Elves of Azeroth (Stormwind) and living side-by-side with the Kirin'Tor. In fact, the Stormwind High Elves far outnumber the Gnomes... Dalaran High Elf Mages have also been around since before Archimonde came to the world, as well.<br />
<br />
Too many things to cover at once. I'm new to posting here, but recently I've found a healthy amount of posts I've been enjoying reading enough to finally start responding. Thank you to everyone for keeping it interesting here. :)</div></div><hr />

even a 10 year old should know what a planetary body is.<br />
<br />
<br />
He is probably still leveling there.</div></div><hr />
