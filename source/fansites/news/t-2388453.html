The WoW Remote Auction House will be deactivated on April 18, 2018. On that date, you will no longer be able to view Auction House listings or make Auction House transactions through the official WoW website or the WoW Armory app, and all links will be removed from our website. After April 18, you’ll still be able to use the WoW Armory app for all other purposes, including accessing your character profiles, talent calculators, event calendars, and more.<br />
<br />
API &amp; Community Sites Unaffected<br />
<br />
Some World of Warcraft community sites make use of Blizzard’s API to access Auction House–related data, and we will continue to support for that. If you regularly visit a site that accesses data from the Auction House to keep an eye on the price of fish, you (and they) can continue to do so after April 18. Carry on fish-watching to your heart’s content.<br />
<br />
Azeroth Auctioneers Need You<br />
<br />
In the meantime, eager auctioneers all over Azeroth are still available and conducting business as usual, so seek them out for all of your Auction House needs. Time is money, friend!</div></div><hr />

I also prefer using the app when I want to list stacks of raw material, which I regularly do; the app will be sorely missed for that, since it is more intuitive to me. Sure, the auction portion of the app has its issues with frequent restarts being forced since it disconnects if you click Buy or expand price listings, but still.<br />
<br />
Also, doing it while away from the computer for days while traveling or whatnot was nice.</div></div><hr />

Less and less, because it feels like a chore. But I still try and do it once a day, because as someone else said, it pays. <br />
I only do gold missions, rep tokens, then on my enchanters, the nethershard missions.</div></div><hr />

It's not about listing it from a phone. It's about using the API endpoints (that the phone app uses, but are available for programmatic access) to buy/sell/post items automatically with no human interaction.</div></div><hr />

The remote auction house isn't just the phone app, you can access the AH through the website. There are botters out there that actually automated their AH activities. While the game is a closed environment, Blizzard has zero chance of detecting someone automating something on their browser or even a custom program pretending to be a browser. Closing remote access has several reasons: preparation for revamping the AH, preparation for rolling everything remote into one app instead of the two we have now, and stopping AH bots. Losing browser access is a very decent trade-off.</div></div><hr />

I do *ALL* of my AH on the armory app, its so much easier as everything in my bank and reagent bank shows up, where as in a regular game only whats in my toon's bags.<br />
on top of that I only log in through out the day at work as I cant log into the game to do my AH activities.<br />
I guess I'll be submitting a ticket to get my 6months purchase to 3 months as thats what I wanted to pay and get as many tokens as I can to max my Battle.net balance to buy other things as i'll probably be walking away from the game now</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh how I would love a region wide auction house, would make purchasing rare transmogs and the like so much easier and would be a great boon to low-populated realms.<br />
<br />
Also searching based on item level as opposed to required level. With multiple versions of the same item from LFR to Mythic it gets kind of annoying when you cant filter it properly.</div></div><hr />

I think they've expressed an interest in rolling the command table features from the Legion app and the Armory app features into a single main WoW app.<br />
<br />
Personally think they should build in a dressing room feature with import/export for outfits between it and the game.</div></div><hr />

sigh, let's make this simple; you have to be subscribed to wow and order to use the remote Auction House the effect, this fact means that they get your $15 a month regardless of how long you play the game it does not increase their profit at all. Unless, of course, you are an Impulse buyer in which case I imagine that seeing the pets and things probably tempt you to waste money if you happen to login versus using your phone.<br />
<br />
As to showing active hours, you already are logging those hours the app doesn't take you offline unless you kill the application process. it's still running it's still clocking the hours on your account being active.<br />
<br />
To summarize a blizzard doesn't get money from the app, blizzard doesn't get money from you logging in and using the auction house, blizzard only gets money from your monthly subscription fee which you would be paying at any rate.<br />

That would be a bad move, I think. They need to merge realms instead.<br />

<br />
wow this is devastating news for me,<br />
I do *ALL* of my AH on the armory app, its so much easier as everything in my bank and reagent bank shows up, where as in a regular game only whats in my toon's bags.<br />
on top of that I only log in through out the day at work as I cant log into the game to do my AH activities.<br />
I guess I'll be submitting a ticket to get my 6months purchase to 3 months as thats what I wanted to pay and get as many tokens as I can to max my Battle.net balance to buy other things as i'll probably be walking away from the game now<br />
<br />
Could you post items on the AH from your bank?</div></div><hr />

Actually, connected realms already merge auction houses together from different realms and do everything else that's entailed in a &quot;realm merger&quot; without forcing character name changes, problem is those connected realms are still largely all dead and they need to connect more of them.<br />
<br />
But there's absolutely no reason for them to stop doing connected realms and just merge realms instead. That would actually be completely pointless and accomplish nothing at all. It's the same exact thing as they do already actually, only when your character is suddenly forced onto another realm you might not get to keep your name. That's literally all that would be different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure what you mean when you say &quot;connected&quot; and &quot;merged&quot;.<br />
I say connected when I'm talking about realms sharing CRZ, and merged when the realms are actually merged into one realm.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know how merged realms work. I know they share the same AH. Connected/CRZ realms do not share AH.<br />
There is still a big difference from connecting AH of all European realms.<br />
Yes, I know they are still dead, which is why I'm saying they should merge more realms and even asked about it in the ask-a-dev MMO-C thread.<br />
<br />
I disagree. It's not the exact same thing. I would gladly see CRZ gone. Most of the dead realms need to go away, but it wont be needed to merge them with the big ass realms. The only possible exception would be the RP realms(EU) - but I'm not too sure the players on the dead realms want to get merged with Argent Dawn even if it means more players, as it could mean more of the 'wrong' type of players for them :P<br />
They also need to give players an indication in the realm list what realms are merged, even if it may be bad &quot;PR&quot; for them.<br />
Still not sure what you mean with your last section after reading it a couple of times. There will be enough players, they just need to merge so many realms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it? I don't think I remember anyone write anything but &quot;Hey I'm on the app lol&quot; when it was new seven years ago. For non-ingame communication there is whatsapp, facebook, skype or any other mobile messenger or voice chat where the important messages are not outspammed by chatting in guild chat or just ignored because nobody reads it anyway.<br />
<br />
But as I said, this could and should be implemented in the other app.</div></div><hr />

Could you post items on the AH from your bank?<br />
<br />
I dont understand the question, traditionally, go to your bank, you put the item in your bag then go to the AH and post it.<br />
with the armory app, with the limit of 200 transactions, I see everything in my bags and my banks, not guild bank, shows up as an item that I can sell, hell even the stuff in my unopned mail shows up.<br />
its not just that, its the main point of me doing it wherever and when ever, I only login at night to play for an hour or two, I dont want to spend it organizing my bags, mail, and AH.<br />
<br />
I really hope they move it to legion app or whatever else but otherwise i'm done with the game, I dont raid, just do enough to make gold. I guess i'll just load up on tokens and let the account sit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this the reason why there are so many idiots undercutting by a ridiculous amount instead of listing everything at a price of X - 1 copper like a sensible person, which the app painlessly allowed you to do automatically ?<br />
<br />
I really hope the AH makes into the other app. If this is because of bots, well... find a way to make botting harder, don't penalize everyone else.</div></div><hr />

I dint said anything dude, you are the one claiming that if you dont use automation then nobody must use it, or at least that was implied by your previous post. I just gave you an answer worthy of yours in the previous post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It worked great for selling many huge amounts of the same item, but for listing large variance of items like transmog, doing it 1 by 1 via the website is a lot more work then some addons can do in-game. (Talking about like 400-500 differently named items in 1 session).<br />
<br />
I am 100% in support of an AH revamp, even if it just removed the lag on high pop realms.<br />
<br />
Scanning 150.000 items/auctions on my realm took me 20 minutes (for a collection addon), for general prices I use TSM.</div></div><hr />

You're probably right, sadly I've lost that satisfaction so the only thing that matters to me is how easy it is to get the gold.<br />

Well, if we want to get silly it is more effort to get on your computer and post on the AH than do it from your phone :) I can type out all the steps for you if you want but I'm just going to list every physical step you have to take to go from sleep -&gt; post on AH on the phone vs on PC</div></div><hr />

Was really helpful in getting alts through the Order Hall Campaigns, but as I am winding down my WoW time until the expansion (and my new main, a mighty rogue, is now ready to embark his mission in BFA), I honestly cannot be arsed to use it.<br />

I have a Horde alt I get to max level every expac to see the story that struggles with gold, so I use it with him.</div></div><hr />

Geting on my computer and opening wow is just as much effort as grabbing my phone and opening the app. Using the action house is no effort rather im using my phone or pc.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's different for you but for me using the app doesn't require me to get out of bed :) To get on wow I have to physically get up, thus more effort. Maybe you have a laptop and it's 100% of the time in bed with you but even then you still have to open it and even if it's open you still have to open wow which requires more physical hand movement than opening the app on your phone :)<br />
<br />

Lots of people bashing the app or saying it was useless, when most people who werent living under a cave have been loging out from the game to auction from their phones because it is much faster. Then there are those who are ok with it just because of botters without even suggesting to make the api only able to interact with the official app which would be the logical thing if botters are the reason for taking it down. Only a minority seems to value the real utility and convenience the app provided. I doubt anyone who has posted 200 auctions in a row both ingame and with the app can say the app was useless.</div></div><hr />
