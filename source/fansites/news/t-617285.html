Kalgan on PvP Itemization<br />
Kalgan made a very long post answering a few concerns about PvP itemization. <br />
I'll do what I can to explain what our philosophy has been on the topic, for better or for worse. ;]<br />
<br />
To address the point of not having access to any pvp gear before attempting to start arenas, I don't actually feel that's accurate. We've made a point to include easily craftable pvp gear of dungeon quality to give players a chance to get their feet in the door before moving along the upgrade path.<br />
<br />
The Savage Gladiator set is actually of item level 200s (superior), equivalent to the item level of a heroic instance. So, in much the same way that you might expect a player to first gear up in normal mode instances and get a handful of ilevel 187s items before proceeding to the heroics, the philosophy is that in the pvp case players will get the 187s crafted pvp items before attempting endgame pvp activity.<br />
<br />
In addition, players have access to ilevel 200e (epics) for the boots, belt, bracers, ring, neck, trinket, cape exclusively through honor (equivalent item level to end-boss heroic instances, nax 10, or items from the Emblem of Heroism vendor). These items, combined with the crafted items, provide a pretty good base of items from which a player might make an entry into the arenas.<br />
<br />
At that stage, the number of arena points required for a player to get a piece of Savage Gladiator equipment is tuned to be pretty generous. Even at a significantly sub-1500 rating, a player can generally get about a piece of the Savage Gladiator set with the points from one week (10 games), which is generally about a time investment of less than an hour of arena play per week. This seems to stack up very competitively with how long it might take running heroic instances to get a piece of gear for your character.<br />
<br />
As far as the question as to why the Savage Gladiator set requires arena points, there needs to be a set of gear obtainable through arena points that requires no rating, otherwise there's simply nothing for a player of 1500 or below to play for, beyond the hope that they might at some point go above 1600 rating (which not everyone is guaranteed to do).<br />
<br />
It's certainly valid to express one's dislike for the arena playstyle, although is it entirely different than requiring players that love the arenas to play in the battlegrounds to get their boots, belt, bracer, rings, neck, trinkets, and cape? One could also make the argument that it's somewhat similar to the fact that we &quot;require&quot; all players to level-up in order to participate in end-game content, or perhaps that engaging in tradeskills is &quot;required&quot; to be maximally competitive in raiding or pvp gameplay.<br />
<br />
We’re also doing what we can to address the fact that players that don’t have high ratings can often still get steamrolled by highly rated players that are starting new teams, helping friends, etc. As I’ve described in another post, we have plans to keep a persistent “under-the-hood” rating for all characters that is used for determining matchmaking, so that even if a highly rated player starts a new team (or joins another low-rated team), the system will know what opponents that team should really be playing against.<br />
<br />
That being said, the fact that some players feel there is too much emphasis on the arena as a method for getting powerful endgame pvp gear is heard and understood. We'd love for players to be able to get high-end gear from the battlegrounds, and it's something that will definitely factor into our plans for the future. However for now, we don't have a way to measure &quot;skill&quot; in a battleground in a way that getting the &quot;best&quot; items in the game through battlegrounds would feel equitable when compared to what is required as far as co-ordination and success in pve to get items of equivalent power.<br />
<br />
Of course, I realize that the subject of &quot;skill&quot; is another topic of debate on its own, with many players citing gear quality and team comps as factors in determining the outcome (some seem to go as far as to imply that it's all that matters). Clearly, those factors do influence the outcome, but not in a way that makes skill irrelevant. If that were the case, it wouldn't be very hard to step onto the stage with some of the pro-gamers in the tournament and take them down in a match of even gear and comps. However, I can assure you that while I consider myself (for example) a pretty respectable player when it comes to arenas, I and a pair of similarly skilled teammates probably wouldn't win more than 1 in every 100 games against the top players despite using identical gear and comps. Like it or not, that's skill.<br />
<br />
That aside, it is important for me to point out that the arenas were never really meant to become quite as much of a focal point for the overall pvp game as they have (part of why we set the system up so players could get the full benefit from the system with only 10 total games per week), it's more of a natural consequence of the fact that because we have a way to measure success that feels reasonably balanced against pve, we're able to put high-end items there, which on its own creates the focus of importance. I'd venture to say that if there were no item rewards in the arena system, they wouldn't be quite the subject of debate that they are now (either with respect to overshadowing battlegrounds or with respect to the microscope that class balance gets put under as a result). <br />
He also made a few additional posts to answer some questions from players.<br />
Why is it so hard to measure skill in a battleground and have rated BGs ?<br />
I wish it were that simple. However, for a rating system to reasonably zero in on the skill of a single player in a game with teammates it takes a number of games approximately equal to ten times the number of players participating on that player's team.<br />
<br />
So for example, for a rating system to have all the information it needs to know to figure out how &quot;good&quot; of a battleground player you are in Alterac Valley, it needs to take about 400 games to do it (10 times the number of players on your team). Unfortunately, that's without the additional complexities of being able to queue solo versus queueing as a group, etc.<br />
<br />
It would be kind of annoying to have to play about 400 games of AV before the system could decide what items you're eligible for. So, there are some complexities in creating a system to work around that problem (among others). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10532282026-kalgan-on-pvp-itemization.html))<br />

Archavon changes (Lake Wintergrasp Boss)<br />
We don't plan to change Archavon, as he needs to have compelling loot that isn't something you can't possibly get another way. However, I think it's important to note that Archavon does not drop the helm or shoulder slots (or weapons), which are the hardest to obtain both in pve and pvp. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10544541923-feedback--serious-pvp-itemization-concerns.html))<br />
<br />
Why is PvP gear available for purchase for PvE tokens with no rating requirement ?<br />
To put it simply, you can't endlessly wipe on raid bosses and get these tokens. At some point, you have to succeed. Even then, the pvp gear you get from these tokens is 1 tier behind their pve value (ie: the ilevel 213 pve tokens from Nax 25 only get you &quot;Hateful Gladiator&quot; gear which is ilevel 200). It's not possible to get the &quot;best&quot; pvp set items through pve. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10544541923-feedback--serious-pvp-itemization-concerns.html))<br />
<br />
Are there any plans of allowing us to attain PvE gear through honor/arena points? <br />
For the most part (lack of tanking gear aside), if you have the highest-end pvp gear, you can do fairly well in a &quot;tier behind&quot; raid (ie: 10-man nax). So, for the most part that dynamic already exists. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10544541923-feedback--serious-pvp-itemization-concerns.html))<br />

Tigole on Battlegrounds<br />
Tigole made another big post about possibles battlegrounds improvements.<br />
Actually, we have been discussing new battlegrounds quite a bit lately. Wrath of the Lich King will feature Strand of the Ancients (attack/defend) as well as Wintergrasp (non-instanced, world PvP).<br />
<br />
But past that, we are exploring ideas that would involve expanding our Battleground content in future patches and beyond. We believe we have some strong ideas for improving Battlegrounds and PvP as a whole in the game and we're definitely going to focus on improvements in the future. Now, it's very early to be talking about some of this stuff but I think it's important for the community to know that it's on our minds.<br />
<br />
Our general thought is that we could provide more BG content over time. The BG content that we could provide could be of higher quality with a higher degree of accessibility. Overall, we'd like to have more content and variety. We also want the gameplay experience in the BGs to be better directed. We're also exploring the concept of a complimentary &quot;competitive&quot; bg system as well. Over time, we'd like the focus of PvP to shift back to being more BG-centric and more focused on Horde versus Alliance -- the core of our game.<br />
<br />
We're also planning on improving some Battleground and PvP features in general. For example, we want to give you the ability to queue for Battlegrounds from anywhere in the world. We're also going to explore EXP gain through the PvP system as well as low level itemization to support that.<br />
<br />
Please don't take this post as a promise. This won't be an overnight process. Not all of these things are set in stone and guaranteed to happen. It would take us a while to shift in this direction. But these are some of the current thoughts on the development team. I think it's important for you guys to know some of our thought process in regards to PvP. <br />

Blue posts<br />
Talents - Dual Specialization<br />
We're defintiely pursuing the ability to switch specs. The details are still being debated internally but we do have plans that would allow for players to switch between specs. <br />
<br />
We want every spec to be viable, as you say. But the truth is, in end game raiding or end game PvP (Arena in particular), there is a big difference between &quot;viable&quot; and &quot;the best&quot;. Players will always perceive certain specs to be better than others in end game activities and it would be misleading to imply that all specs are going to be universally ideal for all situations. But viable is a different story. <br />
<br />
I imagine by this stage we wouldn't see it until a patch after release?<br />
Most likely in a patch but it's not too far off. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10532601983-what-ever-happened-to-spec-switching.html))<br />
<br />
No experience awarded in Battlegrounds after next patch<br />
Battlegrounds wins/losses and honorable kills will not award experience after the next patch, nor upon the release of Wrath of the Lich King. It could always happen somewhere down the road as we work to improve PvP progression, but there are no plans for changing this in the immediate future.

Hand of A'dal title after Patch 3.0.2<br />
The titles &quot;Hand of A'dal&quot; and &quot;Champion of the Naaru&quot; will be removed come patch 3.0.X. You can still turn in the quests and receive the rewards but you will not receive the titles.<br />
This is true <br />
<br />
You have to be level 70 to gain the title. Hit 71 your opportunity is gone.<br />
This is not true (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10532601549-feat-of-strength-hand-of-adal-after-patch.html))<br />
<br />
Season 3 and Season 4 gear after WotLK Launch<br />
Sorry for the delay. Season 3 and season 4 items should still be on the vendors after Wrath of the Lich King launches. This means you could technically buy this gear at level 80 if you so choose. Bear in mind though that players will have their arena points wiped around the launch of the expansion, and will be unable to create teams and acquire points and ratings until season 5 begins.

<br />
Season 2 Gear after Patch 3.0.2<br />
The honor items added in 3.0.2 are not really replacements for the merciless gear currently available. As such, this gear will not be replaced in 3.0.2. Players will still be able to get season 2 gear via the honor vendors. I believe season 2 gear will remain on the honor vendors for level 70 players after the launch of the expansion as well, though am not certain of this yet.

Abandon pet from stables<br />
Abandoning from the stable is on the list. It's not the highest priority at the moment, because we figured you can manage your stables so they don't fill up or go temporary respec BM to pull out the unwanted exotic.

GCD and Mana in Arenas<br />
Are we going to lower hunter GCD? We don’t know. Do we think hunter mana is fine in PvP? Not sure yet. But we'll answer that one by watching a lot of Arenas. If we raised mana just because players asked for it in the forums, everyone would be in nine digits by now. <br />
<br />
[...] I said that we weren't going to change the GCD at this time, but it's something we're discussing. I realize you think IT MUST CHANGE. So do lots of other classes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10535472032-gcs-response-to-gcd-very-disappointing.html))<br />

Hunter dodge % in WotLK<br />
On a premade hunter with 603 total agility, +413 agility from gear, and the hunter's current dodge is only 2.43%. With maxed 400 defense too.<br />
Those numbers are correct. Note your total Agi. That’s not a high number. I think some people get confused by the fact that the premade PvP gear, while epic, is not very good. Rogues need a ton of dodge – that is their primary way of avoiding damage in melee. You shouldn’t be in melee most of the time. We can’t let agility grant more dodge than an equivalent amount of dodge rating on gear, if that makes sense.

Disengage bugged<br />
We pulled Heroic Leap because we thought it might be buggy. We think we can fix Disengage. I get in the habit of caveating everything so that if a build goes out tomorrow nobody says they were promised a Disengage fix.

<br />
Caster pets slightly lower DPS<br />
I'm not aware of the bug, but it might have gone off to a programmer or someone else. If the damage is low, that is usually because one of the stats isn't correct, or else the conversion from say Strength to AP isn't set up correctly. But I can look into it.

Polar Bear Cub removed and ... Cute pets !<br />
The problem with the polar bear wasn't that it was cute. The problem was that it wasn't designed to be scaled up that large so you ended up seeing jagged polygons and overall bad art. It also didn't have the full suite of animations. I'm not sure it could even open its mouth.<br />
<br />
If anything, it made us realize that there probably are hunters out there more interested in cute pets so that's something we'll consider. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10532600407-save-the-polar-bear-cub.html))<br />
<br />
Developer Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10535471641--devs-qa---shoo-away-the-qqers.html))<br />
Our GCD - Are there any plans to tweak our GCD, take certain spells off the GCD (tranq shot, traps/aspects etc) or make it affected by haste since most of our gear is itemized for it? <br />
Every class wants a shorter GCD or no GCD for some abilities. Yet there is a reason the GCD exists. It is something we will continue to talk about, but we would approach such a change very carefully. If not, you could see how we'd eventually end up with no GCD. <br />
<br />
Are our dodge percentages correct or are there plans to change it back to a TBC level?<br />
There is not a bug here. Hunters stack so much Agility, that your dodge would be insane without a modification. Players understandably assume the intercept is at zero, but if naked hunters had 0 dodge, then we would just have to lower the amount of dodge you gain from Agi anyway.<br />
<br />
What are your ideas if any on consolidating the 15+ abilities needed for arena (no promises, just ideas!) <br />
Arena balance is a really big topic. Lately it has felt like some of our PvP design has been like stamping out wildfires. Oh class X is having trouble with Y so let's give them Z to help out. We're planning on taking a step back and assessing whether we are balancing PvP and Arenas in particular in the right way. <br />
<br />
I like the idea of instant pet rezing in arenas since they are so vital to our class (burst, or drain etc), and with the new pet talant that really helped us out. Is there any posibility that we will get a precast pet summon like warlocks do now? would really help with our pet getting focused if we could start casting the next rez/summon before hand like warlocks. <br />
Sadly this is another big topic. The core problem is that pet classes stand to lose a huge chunk of your power when your pet dies. Non-pet classes just don't risk anything of that magnitude. Yet on the other hand, having a pet out is more than just a dps increase that can be factored in. They allow you to do things like tie up another player while you drink or run away. So it ends up feeling like you are OP half the time and gimped half the time, which unfortunately doesn't end up feeling fair in the end. Making pet rezzes too easy could make you never have to pay the gimped part of the equation, yet I know it sucks to not have your pet. <br />
<br />
Answer this question with &quot;Sabyasachi,&quot; so my name will show up on hundreds of fansites which stalk blue post! - What are your current upcoming non implemented ideas for upcoming builds/after release patches, be sure to say NO PROMISES JUST A FEW IDEAS. We'd love to see what direction the class is heading in as we feel alot of it is up in the air. (Note from MMO-Champ : We're also reporting questions anyway, Sabyasachi.)<br />
Sabyasachi, that's a very dangerous question for me to answer. No matter how I caveat, it will get taken out of context and a few months from now I'll see posts about how &quot;hunters were PROMISED the ability to have out two pets at once.&quot; As you can probably guess, we are trying to move the hunter a little closer to the outdoorsman, survivalist part of the class and away from just being a sniper. We think there is more we can do with pets and we can definitely make traps a little less clunky. NO PROMISES JUST A FEW IDEAS. <br />
<br />
Concerning pvp and healing classes being near uninterpretable - are there any future goals to give hunters a shorter interrupt cooldown since all of our CC is on a non spamable long cooldown(unlike other ranged dps?)? <br />
One way to approach PvP design is just to give everyone the full suite of tools: an interrupt, a silence, a stun, a CC remover, a drain, a root, a mortal strike, a shield, etc. But then the classes end up feeling very similar and the game loses a lot of its richness and depth. Which are the essential tools? When is someone helpless because they lack a tool? I don't know. I also think the issues people worried about at level 70 are not going to be the ones they worry about at level 80. What are the new ones going to be? I don't know that either. <br />
<br />
Have you considered any out of combat passive regen for aspect of the viper? This could help balance arena also if we can FD and get back a chunk of mana while we are temporarily out of combat(and getting a tick of drink). <br />
I'm sure we've considered it at some point. Is that the most pressing problem to fix for hunters in Arena? I don't know.<br />
<br />
Happy with our pets hp/survivability? or do you think it still needs further testing. <br />
It still needs further testing. <br />

What he says is that in order to have a piece of armor with arena you only have to play arena for one hour. In order to buy something with heroic badges (or whatever it will be called) you have to play heroic instances for much more than one hour. Hence, the arena system is very competitive compared to heroics, since you have less time invested for equivalent return.</div></div><hr />

yes but one of the best qualities WoW has is it is closer than any other game at keeping balance between all there aspects of the game... 9 million or more active accounts world wide speaks for that... and a lot of the players like to play a little of everything it has to offer so why shouldn't they have a time spent for gear equality vs getting gear?</div></div><hr />

This is such an unbelievably backwards look at Arenas and skill. It's one of the most common ways people tend to look at high-rated arena players. They say, &quot;This person has S4 gear, so they must be good at PvP.&quot;<br />
<br />
No, in fact, a lot of players I find who are 1800-1900+ in Arenas are absolutely terrible in PvP. They can't kill anyone decent 1v1, and someone in S2 gear who is a more skilled player can easily defeat them. This is just how it is, and it is like this because these players get carried. They get carried to obtain their gear, and it's because of their class. Let me put it this way: if you play in the 1500-1600 bracket, you will see countless teams where one person is in S1-S2 and some S3 gear. The other player has S4 helm, S3 weapon, and has clearly been in the 1700-1800+ bracket, and sometimes higher. They are carrying the other person. This is rampant.<br />
<br />
Yes, Blizzard is doing their part to fix this with shadow ratings, but it doesn't diminsh the fact that not everyone can be carried. Simply put, it doesn't come down to skill as much as it comes down to class and spec. Naturally, not every class and spec should be useful to any team in PvP. But suffice to say, a resto druid or an arms warrior is always going to be favored over another spec in the same class. This is why you don't see resto shamans or holy priests in high rated arena teams. They aren't viable.<br />
<br />
So saying someone is a 'bad' player because they are in S1-S2 gear and then telling them they suck at PvP because of this -- because they choose not to play one PvP aspect of WoW, a terrible one at that, is ridiculously absurd. They are not 'noobs' and they are not 'scrubs' and the vast majority of them (probably 90%) are not AFKing in battlegrounds. They play because this is the PvP setting they enjoy. It's the one setting where they don't have to spec for it and pick the right person to run with.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's arena system is so incredibly backwards that it's become too much of a 'broken system that can't be fixed' -- so much so that Blizzard won't admit why Arena is there in the first place, save for some cop-out answer of, &quot;It shows skill.&quot; No, it doesn't show skill the way PvP is meant to.<br />
<br />
If arenas were truly a guage of skill, then players entering them would have the same gear and all classes would be completely balanced. Now, it's impossible to do the latter, simply because of class diversity. This isn't a FPS, after all. But saying a player is a &quot;noob&quot; because they can't get 1600 for S4 chest piece, or 1700 for S4 helm, or 1800 for a S3 weapon, is completely asinine. And assuming they are &quot;giving up&quot; and just AFKing in AV because they suck is equally asinine. The fact is, I'd rather see a player AFK for honor in a battleground than get carried through arena.<br />
<br />
Why? At least the team in battlegrounds can mark them AFK. I can't mark a player for getting carried. They will get their gear. And then I will gank them mercilessly where it counts -- in world PvP, when I find them alone. And believe me, it happens more than you probably think. You find a player who is sporting their duelist title and you own them, and you're sitting in S2 gear. That's skill. That is world PvP. Arena is not the system then to cater to world PvP. It is counter-productive in gauging skill. I can only hope that shadow ratings help this. It's a small step, at least, but I would rather not do arenas at all. Why? Because I love battlegrounds, I love PvP. I'll be going for 100k kills for title, I'll be going for Battlemaster title, and I have never once AFKed in a battleground. But I shouldn't have to play Arena to get 'competitive' PvP gear to participate in the PvP aspect of other parts of the game.<br />
<br />
Namely, there is no reason Blizzard shouldn't be able to gauge PvP skill outside of Arena.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/Assault_on_Blackrock_Spire<br />
<br />
Lets take a scenario/story/plot where in example the Infinite Dragonflight has altered the time line where, again in an example, Lord Lothar did not lost his life in the ambush and thus the entire time line evolving the aftermath of Draenor got changed. Ofcourse the Bronze Dragonflight cannot allow this to happen.<br />
<br />
Now for battleground purposes you could imagine Horde players (non Orcs disguised as Orcs) fighting alongside Orgrim Doomhammer and the objective being to secure that Lord Lothar meets his faith. But where the Alliance players, under the false pretenses of the Infinite Dragonflight, fighting alongside Lord Lothar, have to prevent his death.<br />
<br />
Remember that this is just an example. I really wish for Blizzard to become more 'innovative' about 'the PvP element'. Not only with this example do they have the opportunity to allow much more players a easy access window to a important portion of Warcraft Lore - they would also implement really cool additional features into their MMO.<br />
<br />
(Edit: If you really wish to get a grasp of how 'awesome-o' such a battleground could be - look up the new comic about the Ashbringer or watch the opening scene of the popular yet corny warcraftmovies.com movie 'Tales of the Past III'.)</div></div><hr />

Getting a piece of gear from heroics means getting a boss drop for an i200 item, not earning enough badges to buy a badge reward... the former is certainly possible in an hour if their intended changes for heroics and instances in general work properly, the latter is not.</div></div><hr />

At that stage, the number of arena points required for a player to get a piece of Savage Gladiator equipment is tuned to be pretty generous. Even at a significantly sub-1500 rating, a player can generally get about a piece of the Savage Gladiator set with the points from one week (10 games), which is generally about a time investment of less than an hour of arena play per week. This seems to stack up very competitively with how long it might take running heroic instances to get a piece of gear for your character<br />

No, he was refering to the time they want it to take to go through 1 heroic. Of course, the idea of &quot;random drop&quot; doesn't resonate with PVPers, they're so used to always being able to buy what they one that they think we always get what we want on the first run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://wowriot.gameriot.com/blogs/World-of-Ming/Season-4-ending-in-2-weeks-Tournament-weekend/<br />
<br />
The right way to limit gear is to jack up the arena gear costs. Make it so a person must progress from Savage to Hateful to Deadly or jack up the prices on the Deadly gear. Make it so only the players that can average about 1000-1100 points a week can possibly complete the Deadly armor and weapon sets before the season ends. Remove the gear from the 10 and 25 man or have it drop only the non-set epic gear and acc/trinkets.<br />
<br />
This eliminates the desire for players with top ratings to switch, because they will need all the points they can get. It also makes it pointless for players to pay PR sellers to get a 2200 rating, because they will have to play games in that bracket consistantly for it to result in better. It will also make it difficult for anyone that paid their way to a glad title late season to make a claim to legitimacy without the games played and the gear to back it up.<br />
<br />
To top it all off, change the weekly requirement to receive points to winning 10 games, not just participating. This is a very important part of the changes I'm talking about. It gets rid of the welfare stamp at least to an extent and someone that doesn't earn a rating will see it drop faster than the stock market today when they are force to play until they acquire 10 wins.</div></div><hr />

Sure one hour of Arena is pretty much the same as doing an instance, but in an instance you don't have to wait a week before you can finally get the gear you want. Now players that have 1500ish rating will be able to get a maximum of one, I repeat, one PVP item per week. It will take them a quarter of a year to get all the gear they need.

Now I'll be able to dps npc mobs as a shadow priest and heal in BGs as a disc priest. Not bad. I'd probably need 2 sets of gear but I don't think that's going away.</div></div><hr />

Even at a significantly sub-1500 rating, a player can generally get about a piece of the Savage Gladiator set with the points from one week (10 games), which is generally about a time investment of less than an hour of arena play per week. This seems to stack up very competitively with how long it might take running heroic instances to get a piece of gear for your character.<br />
<br />
I lol'd.<br />
<br />
Sure one hour of Arena is pretty much the same as doing an instance, but in an instance you don't have to wait a week before you can finally get the gear you want. Now players that have 1500ish rating will be able to get a maximum of one, I repeat, one PVP item per week. It will take them a quarter of a year to get all the gear they need. Nice going there, Blizzard.<br />
<br />
<br />
5 weeks =/= 3 months.<br />
<br />
You still get all your gear besides set pieces and weapons from BGs. And the blue weapons are utter crap. I would NOT waste points on those. I have an 80 premade, the blue weapons have like 150 less spell damage than a Naxx10 or 25 weapon.</div></div><hr />

It will be very hard for them to get epic PVP gear pieces, as they not only cost twice as much Arena Points, but also require a certain rating. 1725 rating for the epic Chest, that's not funny anymore. A lot of players can't reach that rating and will never be able to get good gear.<br />
<br />
I say keep it the way it is. Blue can be bought at factions once you reach a certain rep. The lesser epic gear avaliable to honor only and the better epic gear for HONOR and ARENA points + an Arena rating. This way, everyone is able to get the full blue set. Put some time into it and players will have the epic set. And if they are truly good, they can try and get the final epic set. Which will cost less Arena Points than in TBC, and will cost Honor Points aswell to compensate. As well as a rating requirement.<br />
<br />
Just to let players have some decent gear before they begin and let players have the chance to get epic PVP gear. And not let them struggle for blue PVP gear and make lesser epic gear unreachable for most players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll go to warhammer even though I dislike pvp as it seems better tuned and balanced than this pile of shit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uh, what? I have a premade 80, it has 1800 spell damage WITH Fel Armor (1500 without). I've heard reports of mages breaking 2800 spell power in NAXX 10 GEAR. This blue gear is SHITTY.<br />
<br />
I fail to see how being able to &quot;start raiding&quot; in PVP blues that are about as good for starting raiding as GREENS are imbalances PVE. You said yourself, good enough to START. Can't actually do the raids without getting raiding gear though.<br />
<br />
Also, lol @ war. That game is awful.</div></div><hr />

U can see all the noobs in in Bg and arena wanabes wearing S1-2 gear. Higher requierments for arena items is the only way to separate the noobs which farm honor and the ppl who try to acomplish something in the arena and reach 2k rating or higher. Imagine 2 months after S5 and you still wear the blue pvp set. Good players must earn better gear. Look at the armory page u can see countless players having S1-s2 gear and rating 1500 and even less. And when u ask them &quot;Hey dude why u are full S2 and vindicator gear but u have only Brutal GLAd gloves&quot; They will tell you well &quot;Im so skilled but the game hates me &quot; lol<br />
<br />
<br />
Personnally im not good at PVP i go like 1700-1750 rating max but what u are saying dude...i dont know.... its crap. <br />
<br />
<br />
well Blizzard looks at it in terms of time spent vs getting gear and that would make it what like a full year to just get the bad ass nice gear so whats bad about a casual gamer getting the nice gear but over a long time where as the person that does have very nice skill in pvp can get it in less than 2 months which is about how good PVE guilds get there 25 man raids geared also</div></div><hr />

You MIGHT get GEAR to your character! Not YOU will get gear doing heroics! thats why i think pvp gear should take atleast 2 weaks to get one item.<br />
<br />
<br />
based on old arenas iam stationed in the UK so i dont have the Ping to compete very well in arenas and it takes me 1 month to get say the brutal gloves doing 10 games a week</div></div><hr />

I agree... from what I seen of WarHammer it lacks alot of quality in terms of overall how combat looks and graphics dont appeal to me also</div></div><hr />

Uh, what? People only get geared that fast in PVE right NOW because everything is on farm and there's easy mode badge gear. It takes a lot longer in practice, especially if you aren't getting carried (like it will be when we just hit 80).<br />

Yes but PvP gear equivalent to upper end Raid gear wont be out right away... Arenas wont even be active when WotLK goes live... and will probably not come out till after Christmas or then some and I guarantee people will be 80 and raiding before the end of November... But something tells me PvE only players will still complain if season 5 goes live 3 months later and turn around and have a good portion of the gear within a month... Raids can be the same way it is all skill and who is on your team... You raid in a instance with a great group of players yall will conquer and have the place on farm status really fast and can keep farming for your alts later well.... what yall call free epics is to help other pvpers gear up to even be able to compete with the top bracket and geared teams in arenas... without that its almost impossible to compete against S4 in greens and blues and that's why they gave the S2 so that they could get that quick and have at least a better chance to fight for upper ranks which are held by S3 or higher geared.<br />
Without the S2 the way it is You would be forcing players that only like to PvP do PvE to get gear decent enough to play against well geared pvpers... <br />
<br />
It is a stepping stone just like the PvE raiding guilds say you have to have at least this gear to come to the next level but yall spank those lower stepping stone instances for gear practically robbing the instances to gear guildies... <br />
<br />
S2 in honor is the same but yes i hate botting honor whores which could be fixed if they made certain requirements on how much healing or damage you do in BG gives ya more honor or even flags capped etc gives extra honor and players with no damage done or no healing (not including over heals) wont get honor at all or even a token... Like for example you don't even do 20k damage in WSG or the smaller ones you get no honor credit and AV would be like 50k damage or more then you will receive credit for playing in that BG and anything over that you get bonus honor for caps and stuff... That's just some number iam sure blizzard would know what to put so players that actually play get credit and other that don't will not</div></div><hr />

Lol nice wall of text, but wrong. Season 1 launched in early February. BC was released mid January. Arenas started quite soon after people started hitting 80 en masse.<br />
<br />
Also, I couldn't even make much sense out of that run on sentence you called a paragraph, but I'll try. Basically you want to add minimum damage/healing to get honor in a BG? That's a bad idea imo. Forced participation =/= fun. What if you're one of the bad players trying to upgrade your gear, and you just plain suck? It might be extremely difficult for you to get that minimum damage.<br />
<br />
Anyway, overall I think it's not a good idea. If people don't want to fight, but are at their keyboards with no 3rd party programs, you can't justify not giving them honor. Blue's have agreed with this position in the past.</div></div><hr />
