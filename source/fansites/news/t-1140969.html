Weather Effects<br />
We just added weather to all the zones in the last build. If you are not seeing it yet, just give it some time to show up. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/225458-pandaria-no-weather/) / Official Forum (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4903180408?page=3#56))<br />

Mage PvP<br />
The intent is that stronger player snares (such as Frost Bomb) should not overwrite weaker player snares (such as Frostbolt). Their effects won't stack, but the debuffs should persist.<br />
<br />
Example: You Frostbolt a rabbit. It gets the Frostbolt debuff and is snared by 50%. You then Frost Bomb the rabbit (under the assumption that you are really scared of this rabbit for some reason). The rabbit gets the Frost Bomb debuff and is snared 70%. However, it doesn't lose the Frostbolt debuff and two seconds later when Frost Bomb wears off, it is now snared at 50%.

<br />
While expected, it does get a bit tedious with all the &quot;nickle-and-dime&quot; stuff going on in EVERY expansion. TBC was easy: Reach 70, buy flying license. In every subsequent expansion, they do exactly the same thing. Next thing you'll know, they'll add a ground mount license for every expansion as well. I mean, &quot;Cold Weather Flying&quot; in Northrend, is an excuse because the flying mounts may not be capable of handling the cold weather otherwise. But then, shouldn't ground mount be subject to the same limitation in Northrend? :)<br />
<br />
On topic: The new &quot;Faction Capitol&quot; locations look real cool. Lots of cool artwork going into this expansion. While i'm not currently playing WoW, nor have any current intention of returning, Mists of Pandaria certainly looks tempting. Depends on when it's out, and how things goes for Guild Wars 2.</div></div><hr />

Just give it a try in game with the music and sounds that go along with it. It is one of the nicer areas in this expansion.</div></div><hr />

I'm fairly certain Blizzard has taken the stance of not removing content/rewards (i.e. Light of Dawn).<br />
<br />
<br />
and the people with &quot;of the Four Wind&quot; title didn't have to pay for the training when they finally reach 90 (?).<br />
<br />
This would actually be an interesting idea. Perhaps a chat option from the vendor?<br />

Hmm, good point. I guess I'm one of those elitist players who think that titles should matter, because they are some sort of honorifics, if you ask me. On the other hand, having &quot;of the Four Wind&quot; as a way to bypass the 2,500 gold fee, more people would feel inclined to revisit old content and experience something they haven't done before - even though it's not very relevant when you are level 90. I think Blizzard is all for revisiting old content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the majority of people can be screwed over because a handful of people want world pvp? No thanks, I'd take flying over obnoxious pvprs anyday. I play on a PVE server and prefer it to stay that way, now if they could somehow do that ONLY for PVP servers sure, what ever floats your boat. I think their should be a bigger difference between the 2 server types really .... Sure one auto flags you but you get that BS on a PVE server by getting near some useless little no name lowbie town that shouldn't flag you to start with. Flagging should be handled like it was before: Major cities only or YOU attacking the guards/another player.</div></div><hr />

It seems sort of silly that we'll have to go back to Stormwind / Orgrimmar for EVERY piece of gear we replace, especially considering the fact that that replacement is going to happen very, very fast as we level / start getting into dungeons and raids. It's not like we didn't get enough of the faction capitals in this expansion. If I never have to see Stormwind again, I won't shed a tear &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

No, silly would be bothering to mog levelling gear at all, given that it's going to match anyway. Probably dungeon gear either; this isn't TBC and clown suits any more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. Titles should matter and be a sign of honor, when they are current. After new content is introduced with new challenges and rewards, the old content and rewards should remain for all to enjoy at their own pace. To say that titles should be wiped between expansions is arbitrary in my opinion. Heroic T11 bosses can be outgeared with heroic T12/T13 gear, reducing their difficulty (not to the extent 5 character levels do, but still easier); a purist would argue that titles be wiped between tiers.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, having &quot;of the Four Wind&quot; as a way to bypass the 2,500 gold fee, more people would feel inclined to revisit old content and experience something they haven't done before - even though it's not very relevant when you are level 90. I think Blizzard is all for revisiting old content.<br />
<br />
I was thinking along the same lines. Imagine leveling an alt halfway through MoP and being able to save 2,500 gold by joining a fun raid. Keeps older content alive and provides players with tangible benefits.</div></div><hr />

a) you will make more than 2.5k from levelling 85-90, I'm pretty sure 80-85 was a lot more<br />
b) if you have 16 85s, there is no way you should have so little money :l</div></div><hr />

Flying (60%, mind you) in Burning Crusade was 1,000g. That was 1,000g three expansions before MoP (meaning gold inflation wasn't that high).<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if the questing required to get to 90 will net you more than 2,500g, making this a nonissue for most. If flying is necessary on every character you play and you can't fly in Pandaria until level 90 anyway, it's basically taking away the gold you make from questing between 85 and 90.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Nath'd so hard.</div></div><hr />

In Cata you gained at least 5k from levelling up through quests. If the gold inflation continues as it has so far, you'll be gaining a lot more from levelling to 90. 2.5k will be nothing more than pocket change.</div></div><hr />

Well my own fault I guess for expecting something on the scale of Silvermoon where you have the city cut in half which in MOP's case would house each faction.<br />
<br />
People with bad comps are going to QQ too if everyone is in this building at once. Could be Dalaran all over again but oh no we get something the size of Stormwind Keep... and I think thats being generous.<br />

Honestly, the cities seem like the TARDIS - bigger on the inside. I was dubious as you when I first rode up to them, but it took a fair amount of time to explore everything, and I did get lost a couple times.

Fire Mage PvP<br />
The intent is that stronger player snares (such as Frost Bomb) should not overwrite weaker player snares (such as Frostbolt). Their effects won't stack, but the debuffs should persist.<br />
<br />
Example: You Frostbolt a rabbit. It gets the Frostbolt debuff and is snared by 50%. You then Frost Bomb the rabbit (under the assumption that you are really scared of this rabbit for some reason). The rabbit gets the Frost Bomb debuff and is snared 70%. However, it doesn't lose the Frostbolt debuff and two seconds later when Frost Bomb wears off, it is now snared at 50%.</div></div><hr />

If they don't make guards one-shot everything like in all the past expansions, maybe it will happen, though most servers are heavily one-sided, so if their new inter-server-connect zones don't work with cities and the zone those are in, I expect no real pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, no kidding, I was wondering who was asleep on the wheel at this one. They finally have a voice, and no posts, but the guys have gotten 2?</div></div><hr />

How in the world is this going to work, when you're probably 90 in 2-3 days without rushing and able to instantly buy flight in Pandaria? And I'm not talking about the price to be ramped up, what I mean is, that flight should be tied to a 3 months faction grind to even have a very brief period of the expansion focused on world pvp.<br />
But it doesn't seem to have any other conditions other than being level 90 and having a laughable amount of gold. I mean I knew they're going to blatantly lie about delaying flight to enable more world pvp, but i still hoped it would be at least for more than the pure leveling process, which won't take longer than one day for extreme players and up to 3 for casuals.</div></div><hr />

Well this is how it always ends, good idea but it always ends being catered to casuals who can't stand using ground mounts for some reason.</div></div><hr />

Sure, you can fly, but you're risking death every time you do. Not that I expect they'll do it. Modern WoW doesn't like actually threatening characters with death. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually it kind of is there fault for complaining to blizzard and blizzard adding an artificial and frankly ridiculous barrier to flying in mists<br />

Why do people want to force ground mounts on every one?, if you love ground mounts so much, just use it and let those who like flying mounts use that, or is it because when you get to 90 and get that flying mount skill, you can then go and kill people on ground mounts more easily, effectiveely ganking, also called world PvP?.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not everyone plays the ah blizzard :(<br />
<br />
So you have 16 85's. Nicely done. I commend you sir.</div></div><hr />

its called self centeredness. you see they want people to play the game exactly as they want them to. world pvp ie ganking ppl questing, traveling or hanging out in a hub. enjoying the scenery on the ground not in the air, as blizzard intended for the world to only be seen from the ground implementation of flying mounts be damned. and overall being a self centered douche</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">good diu bro</div><div class="date">2012-06-04, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah same here, in Dalaran it takes 10 seconds to fly from the AH to the banker or anything else for that matter where as in this new city you have to walk all the way from one side or tier to the other :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Shattrath was closer, but the downside is you dont have the teleport ring like Dalaran.<br />
In before reroll a mage, yea, I dont like how they force us to use a specific capital city, like they force us to use Valley of Wisdom or Dwarven District now, just because it is the portals.<br />

Try: level your less important alts at 5.1</div></div><hr />

Not just fly over it and go after quest objectives.<br />
<br />
I'm betting they will change it after awhile just like they did in Wrath and TBC.<br />
<br />
in other words, contrived as always. If they don't want lower levels farming these areas then introduce some flying mobs whom you can fight while mounted.</div></div><hr />

You forget that not everyone plays on a pvp server so it would be kind of hard to get the other faction to flag themselves so they could have an all out battle in the world.</div></div><hr />
