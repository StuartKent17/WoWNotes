Armory Stats - Proving Grounds<br />
With the news that Proving Grounds will no longer be a requirement for Heroic Dungeons in Legion, we are taking one last look at the completion rate in Warlords. The data used today is a sample of characters from 1.9 million accounts. We also did this earlier in Warlords of Draenor, which you can see here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4794-Armory-Stats-Proving-Grounds-Blue-Posts-Blue-Tweets-Wildstar-Update). <br />
<br />
You can see scoreboards on WoWProgress for DPS (http://www.wowprogress.com/char_statistics/field.pg_damage), Healing (http://www.wowprogress.com/char_statistics/field.pg_healer), and Tank (http://www.wowprogress.com/char_statistics/field.pg_tank) endless.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
will gnome hunter be released before or after legions launch?<br />
Gnome Hunters will be available on day-one of the #Legion pre-expansion patch. https://t.co/uXUNZy12km (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/732348739734511617))<br />
<br />
Items<br />
With Legion having alot of legendaries will we be able to transmog them. If not, can we atleast hide Helm/Cloak legendaries?<br />
You will be able to transmog #Legion legendaries to other appearances and vice versa. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/732340400795459585))<br />
<br />
Artifact Weapons<br />
artifact trait cost seems to double after 12 ranks, ~575 to 1260 for rank 13? intended?<br />
Yes; after 12 traits you are transitioning past the level-up experience. Around that time, you will accrue (1/2) https://t.co/OsNZDGDyv3 (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/732341043799035904))<br />
Artifact Knowledge which will increase the rate at which you gain Artifact Power overall. (2/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/732341270438252544))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
There is a pervasive myth that making content hard will induce players to rise to the occasion. We find the opposite. (2013) (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/340939865858396162))<br />
Is it really a myth though? Maybe those rising aren't complaining, a silent majority? This btw is why people play Vanilla.<br />
Our data suggested it was a myth. Note that &quot;not everyone should be able to do this&quot; is a fine answer too. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724602889646141440))<br />
How do you feel about it now? Was the data right? Did the myth have some truth?<br />
I think &quot;hard&quot; is just a difference audience. You have to choose. But you can't make hard stuff intended for easy players. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724605165777473537))<br />
I love Dark Souls. But that's because it is targeted at gamers like me, not ALL gamers. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724605311500210177))<br />
hard is what people want. It's human psychological. You feel more accomplished when finishing something hard.<br />
*If* you finish. If you quit because it's too hard or you don't want hard then the developer lost a player. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724660389124825088))<br />
if you don't want hard then why play. We are already wasting time on a game, why not make it rewarding?<br />
There are a lot of easy games that are popular. I think that's fine. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724703285542703104))<br />
My caution for developers is decide who your audience is and don't try to be all things to all players. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724703361291833344))<br />
<br />
looking at that. I am wondering was cata bad move? Players seems more acceptance to this model rather than WOD simple pruning<br />
It depends if your intended audience is engaged players who want more or returning / lapsed players who might be overwhelmed. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724604383682424837))<br />

Making of Warcraft In-Game Trailer<br />
A video has been released that shows a little bit of the editing process to make the fan created Warcraft trailer that used in game assets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5685-Warcraft-Movie-Trailer-in-WoW-Movie-Music-Blue-Tweets-Build-of-the-Month-DLC-536). <br />

Same. I checked it out on a beta weekend and thought it seemed just fantastic. But I don't like FPSes and am far beyond horrible at them, so I have no expectation of getting any enjoyment out of it, and won't be buying it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah. I don't mind if some things are hard, and that can even be satisfying when you get past it. But I don't know what the guy wants to be 'hard', and I think the raid participation stats make it hard to argue sweeping statements about what people in general want...</div></div><hr />

Just like Diablo, Starcraft or Warcraft at their beginnings, Overwatch its a new ip which have to start somewhere, they can and will expand that new universe as they see fit. The game is just releasing now, and since it has so many heroes from around the world they can literary make single player content in the future for each hero with their own story, rivals e.t.c. This ip releasing now with so little content is just the beginning of something really interesting, they aren't tied to anything in regards to lore, or even gameplay for that matter.</div></div><hr />

I did some basic research showing that Hunters were an order of magnitude easier to get through proving grounds than a Warlock (the worse).<br />
<br />

<br />
Here are my stats (from WoWprogress) ...<br />
<br />
Here is the list of classes in order of easiest to hardest in proving grounds, along with the score for person #23 in their class. I've also added the number of characters with a score of 7000 or higher in endless.<br />
<br />
Hunter : 8697, 29@ over 7000 &lt;--- easiest<br />
Monk : 7593, 25@ over 7000<br />
Rogue : 7298, 23@ over 7000<br />

Overwatch is basically what remains of project Titan. They were struggling to get all of the elements to work well but saw that this FPS--which is far from &quot;worthless&quot;--worked really well on its own, so they salvaged it from the wreckage along with all of the Lore that we've been seeing to give it context and backstory. <br />
<br />
I, too, would have loved to have seen this in an MMO setting, but I tend to believe them when they say it just wasn't working out and rather than bringing out an MMO that would have been a mess they snipped out this tiny part of it which has proven very successful even before launch. I look forward to its further development.</div></div><hr />

that said i think even die hard console gamers mostly agree first person shooters and consoles are 'nope'.<br />
<br />
except that at least 20 people bought the game for PS4/Xbox so whatta ya know... :o<br />
<br />
loved the short, the saturday morning cartoon vibe overwatch has greatly arouses me in my weirdest places<br />
<br />
i managed to get the game 10 dollars cheaper via getting the 30 day free trial of amazon prime and then even with shipping, AUD conversion and all that i got it cheaper than the official blizzard storefront. (and that's a boxed copy not a digital key)<br />
<br />
Did the same with legion for even great effect, 51 AUD, that's like, 42 USD? The storefront is like LOL 70 DOLLARS OR FLUNK SQUIRT<br />
<br />
But they made the unwise assumption that I am not a huge fucking jew. :D (I got it's Box, also... gonna dig right into that box)<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'll have to wait a little to play it, but I suspect we'll have an error 37-ish fiasco again. So I won't really be losing out on much, besides I've got Assessments to do and gamedev after that so the wait will be ideal.<br />

Grindy? What is exactly meant by that? Its a pvp shooter with all characters released. Your profile levels up and you verse other people.<br />
Would you or this person call counter strike grindy? Or hearthstone coz its the same premise u cue.and you play.<br />
I guess that's grindy coz its the same gameplay over and over. <br />
I always interpret grindy as killing mobs for leather over and over rather than doin raids or battlegrounds on repeat.</div></div><hr />

Except you're not grinding for gear. There are no &quot;ultimate weapons&quot; or whatever to unlock--all characters have their weapon(s) and abilities right from the start.

Are these things tied to special achivements which come from the &quot;quality&quot; of your playstyle (=skill), or is this a thing of &quot;win x matches with character y to get skin z&quot;, where x is a double or even a triple digit number? Is there a kind of achievement tree which is mostly based on time spent in game, not on special situations? If time is the main thing, then it is grindy.

Edit: Compare these 2 promotions. Hearthstone got you a unique WoW mount for winning 3 (!) games of a category (I don't remember much about that achievement, and I don't play Hearthstone anymore). This was not time-consuming, and definitely not grindy. Now take Graves, a HotS promotion pet for WoW. To get this, you have to level a character in HotS to level 40 (!).

It may come as a shock to you, but some people actually get more joy out of relatively simple but fun activities for their R&amp;R time than they do from &quot;hard&quot; games. There's always constructive activities (i.e. not time wasting games) that produce far more value for someone seeking hard challenges to overcome. Accomplishing something &quot;hard&quot; in WoW is worth exactly zilch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not so much graphics design, although when it comes to video editing a MacBook Pro with Final Cut Pro X is amazingly well put together, and gives a custom high end computer a run for its money.<br />
<br />

Sadly I do agree about price to build quality. There was a time Apple had a decent price for their systems, and did use very good components. <br />
When the Mac Pro line launched it was significantly more expensive to get either a custom build workstation, or a competitor's Windows one that matched it on price to performance.<br />
<br />
The same happened with the 2013 version aka the Trashcan Mac. Issue is, they dropped user upgradeability, and haven't updated it since its launch; while the price remained the same. So it's pointless getting that now.<br />
<br />
Until I sold my 2009 Mac Pro, I made that thing work for its keep until 2013. I flashed the firmware, changed from a 2.66Ghz Quad Core, to a 3.33Ghz 6 core, upgrade from 8-24GB of RAM, added in a Blu-Ray drive/writer, added in SSD's and a PCIeSSD, USB3.0, and changed the GPU several times. <br />
<br />
You could simply use any current NVIDIA GPU at the time as both Apple and NVIDIA released drivers. NVIDIA actually do so one a 2-3 month cycle. So at the moment if your PSU can handle it you can slap in a GTX 980 or a Titan if you want and it would be supported. Only issue being you won't see the boot screen until it's time to log in due to the GPUs not using an Apple EFI, and use a normal Bios instead.<br />
<br />
http://i.imgur.com/T7zQoGL.jpg<br />
<br />
Sadly since then they completely change their direction, and I honestly can't even recommend their systems to even die hard fanboys.<br />
<br />
I would love to use FCPX again, it's just great, but I don't see myself going to a Mac anytime soon again, or bothering with a Hackintosh.<br />
<br />
Even so, I know quite a few people that still game on their Mac, and these are older models so Metal support Legion alone is nice as even in it's extremely early stages of support they're seeing 10-20fps games in heavy areas. <br />
<br />
Considering then how well Overwatch runs on a host of systems, I do hope Blizzard support OS X there as well. They have been supporting OS X since the 90's; and many people are disappointed they can't get the latest Blizzard game on their platform of choice.</div></div><hr />

Casual tends to be classified as the &quot;lol stand in fire while collecting loot in lfr&quot; guys, while hardcore tends to be classified as the &quot;Raid every night, grind till my eyes bleed&quot; crowd. <br />

Meanwhile there's this wide variety of players who enjoys a little or lot of everything in between yet gets tossed into 1 category or the other by the community as a whole. It's sad really that we treat our own community this way. Hard doesn't have to = grind. I would argue that grind doesn't = hard in the first place. Hard is something that requires skill. Most grinds in this game can be accomplished by anyone willing to put the time into doing it. That's not hard. Depending on the reward for doing so, it's not even fun in many cases. <br />
<br />
Take proving grounds for example. I was one of those select few who did the endless waves in MoP. But I didn't even go beyond silver for WoD. As a matter of fact, I haven't even went back in since the day I unlocked the heroic dungeons at launch. Just not worth it for a few more achievement points. Now for people who go for achievements that makes little sense, but for me, it's just not a fun use of my limited play time I have these days. To each their own though. We'd be a happier community if everyone would try to remember that from time to time.</div></div><hr />

Numbers aren't relevant ... the proportions however are.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has had a long history of supporting Mac gaming, so to hear during Blizzcon that Overwatch was only coming to Windows, PS4 and Xbox One on launch and that there were no current plans for a Mac version was surprising and disappointing. I put the question to game director Jeff Kaplan in our interview - why now, on their most anticipated game in years, does Blizzard drop Mac support?<br />
<br />
I also asked Kaplan how he felt about the Overwatch beta backlash.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a result of not having all the technological support we needed to make the game viable on Mac systems.&quot; says Kaplan, referring to Apple’s policies with OSX. &quot;We have a real love and dedication for Mac players, they’ve been extremely loyal to us and we love giving them Blizzard games.<br />
<br />
&quot;But when dealing with the PC, the Xbox One and the PS4 - all of which are extremely welcoming to the technological needs to run a next-generation shooter - in a lot of ways we felt left behind, that we weren’t given the support we needed to make a great product on the Mac.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's the meat of it, but I really recommend reading the entire article.</div></div><hr />
