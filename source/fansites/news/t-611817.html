Threads have popped up in several class forums that seem to be converging on a few of the same issues. So rather than cross-posting a lot, I thought I would start a new thread.<br />
<br />
Tanking Design<br />
Our goal in Lich King is for all 4 tanking classes to be viable.<br />
We would like for tanking to be a little more fun. I'm going to leave this vague on purpose, but it is definitely a concern.<br />
In 5-player instances, most warriors, druids, paladins and death knights should be effective tanks. The healing specs may have a harder time than the dps specs. Arms wariors, Fury warriors, Ret paladins, Ferals and most DKs should do fine.<br />
In 5-player heroics, the expectation is that the tank has a heavy investment in tanking talents and appropriate gear. Arms warriors might have trouble tanking a heroic unless they overgear the instance.<br />
For raids, we want all 4 tank classes to be viable. If your group has e.g. a Prot paladin and Feral druid as main tanks with appropriate gear and reasonable skill, you should be good to go.<br />
This is a shift in philosophy for us. Previously, we sometimes tried to steer Ferals as being better off tanks than main tanks. We also expected specific classes to appear in the raid. Our new assumption is that you might have any of the 4 tanking classes as a tank. We are trying to achieve as much parity as we can among the 4 tanks without making them too similar. If nearly all guilds want the same class as their MT, we've failed.<br />
This is a big one: the game isn't finished. We aren't spending too much effort yet to make sure mitigation, threat and tools are similar across the 4 classes at level 80 in blue or purple gear. Likewise, your talent trees and core abilities aren't finished. Tanking (and PvP) need to have a lot of other pieces of the game in place before we can really get the numbers right. It's fine (useful even) to point out when you feel a particular ability, talent, class or build is too good or not good enough. But please don't infer the work in progress as a reflection of our intent. If we end up changing our minds or if things don't work out, it will be posted here.<br />
There are a lot of changes in Lich King that change tanking and raiding in general. I won't list them all out here, but keep in mind things like itemization changes, widespread raid buffs, consumables, UI changes, etc. Just keep them in mind. We're not in Tempest Keep anymore. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We would still like to have tanking &quot;flavors&quot; as you put it, but I want to be a little careful when I say that because some people have taken that to mean that their class won't be good enough to tank the content they want.<br />
<br />
If druids had gigantic health pools but lower mitigation and avoidance than a warrior, that would be tanking flavor. It would mean you heal the bears a little different -- they might drain more mana, but the damage would be more predictable. In really long fights, the warrior might have an advantage. In a fight where a boss hit quickly for less damage per hit, the warrior might have an advantage. In fights with periods of really big damage, the druid might have an advantage. In magic fights where armor was less of a factor, the druid might have an advantage. This is just an example. Our overriding concern is making sure the tanks have the tools, threat and mitigation they need to tank. A secondary concern is making sure they don't feel too similar. <br />

Feral concerns in WotLK<br />
We're not done with Ferals. The builds you get are often a week or more behind ours, and that assumes that a designer actually went in and made changes. It's impossible for us to balance the threat and mitigation of the 4 tanking classes until we can take a look at the level 80 characters, wearing raid-level gear, and fighting a raid-level encounter. None of that content is done yet.<br />
<br />
I said above that I think the old design of &quot;You can't ever be a MT, but you get to be a terrific OT&quot; feels dated. But in order to be a MT as good as a paladin or warrior, you can't also dps as well as a Fury warrior with the same spec. I don't think anyone is asking for that, but realistically the only way to address is it with talents. (And before someone asks, if you like the OT role, you can still do that too.)<br />
<br />
I'm fine bouncing between druid, warrior, paladin and death knight forums posting &quot;You will be able to MT Ulduar without gimping your raid&quot; every few days if that's what it takes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/8537784293-feral-concerns-in-wotlk.html))<br />
<br />
Those statements aren't mutually exclusive. A druid can be a better MT on some fights and a warrior a better MT on some fights without the fight being impossible for the other class. I can't promise that each raid will have an equal number of fights that benefits one tank over the other, and ultimately it shouldn't really matter. If your guild has a bear and prot paladin as your 2 MTs for LK raiding, you are good to go. At no point will you stop and say, &quot;Gee if we only had a warrior MT, we would have beaten that boss by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The comments on &quot;niche&quot; are more to address concerns that the 4 classes have to be carbon copies of each other. Warriors, like other tank classes, are worried that with all of the changes, their role will somehow be eliminated. I am trying to reassure you all that that is not the case. I think we can have say druids have larger stamina pools and warriors have more mitigation without making one of them the tank that 90% of raids run with.

Raid Wide Battle Shout<br />
The plan is for for Battle Shot to go raid wide. A lot of buffs will be going raid wide. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/8765689776-battle-shout-reverted-to-party-only.html))<br />
<br />
Protection Spec and DPS<br />
We think we can make the Prot tree more fun. Without talents like Defiance, there are already a few less mandatory talents, and we think we can make even more interesting choices. We definitely can improve Prot dps, so that it doesn't feel so painful to go do dailies or run a 5-man in a dps role.

Scourge Strike / Plague Strike<br />
At the moment, the only difference between Plague Strike and Scourge Strike is the damage. Both can remove hots. Scourge Strike's damage appears lower than it is because it hits for Shadow damage and thus ignores armor. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/8765694487-purpose-of-scourge-strike.html))<br />
<br />
Talent spec as a tanking Death Knight<br />
In any case, I have tried to say on a few occasions that the goal is NOT that a DK can be awesome at dps and tanking with any spec. The goal is that not every DK tank needs to use the same tree. To be a MT, a death knight will have to pick up tanking talents -- you probably need 16-20, and possibly even more.

PvP Snare Ability<br />
As far as a PvP- snare ability goes, we are going to try something like removing the cooldown and root from Chains of Ice. It will drop the target's movement to zero, and the target will regain 5% movement speed per sec for 20 sec (10 in PvP). It's a physical debuff that cannot be dispelled and isn't subject to diminishing returns. Let us know how it goes. If it's too spammy now, we can put a cooldown back on it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/8765584448--full-death-knight-review-.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, you DK's get a spell that can be spammed, which drops movement to as far as 0%. Not even diminishing returns. That plus the 'get over here' spell will make sure no-one gets away from the DK. Now why do they get all these goodies while pala's have been waiting forever for a snare, or something to close the distance...<br />

(not wanting to make this into a &quot;pallies are underpowered&quot; thread, because they are not. but still...)</div></div><hr />

You can't use it every GCD like spamstring. DK's will have to give up a frost rune in order to keep someone permanently snared. Sounds like a fair trade. If it's not, they said they'll change it.<br />
<br />
Only concern I'd have over it is the fact that it's ranged.</div></div><hr />

Totally agree with you. Druids can heal do melee and ranged dps. Loladins can heal tank and do melee dps. DKs and Warriors won't be any really needed class in the game and we'll just go back to try finding a place to OT&gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

For druids in their current form where they can do near-top dps and near-top tankign with the same spec I4d agree.. But sayign a paladin can tank, dps and heal is bullshit.. in that comparison warriors can tank and dps too.. <br />
If you spec 100% for it and can't do anything else worth while during that spec.. you're supposed to be equal to the other people fillign that roll. Or do you realy want rogues to stand neck and shoulders above everyone elses dps caus we can 'only' dps? (we should btw, but only caus we don't buff anyone)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As long as their tanking and melee dps specs are mostly populated from the same talent tree, there is no reason at all for druids to be equal to the other tanks in pure boss tanking ability since they will continue to be more beneficial to the raid if they switch to doing dps if any extra tanks aren't needed after clearing trash. I think it is perfectly acceptable for them to be sub par in both roles as long as they can easily switch from one to the other to fill the situational needs of the raid. Just have to make sure that they don't get stuck in the situation of &quot;thanks for helping tank trash, but we really don't need you for the boss, so see you later,&quot; which they are already less likely to see than that extra prot warrior you brought along.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the LFG QQ will greatly drown out all the warrior QQ and all four classes will achieve parity in tanking.<br />
<br />
As for warriors complaining about druids and paladins being able to be tanks, DPS, or healers, and that they shouldn't be as good at tanking ... well, tough luck.<br />
<br />
I've known some amazing DPS warriors that put out really good numbers. I'm not saying the DPS trees couldn't use some work, but do you honestly think blizzard has it all figured out yet?<br />
<br />
Level 80 isn't even unlocked on the beta realms yet, and when it is, I expect all sorts of changes in classes.<br />
<br />
I honestly can't see Death Knights being left in their current state at level 80. They have so many abilities that shut down different classes it isn't even funny. I can't imagine the 75% magic damage reduction bubble in arena. A guy playing around pillars? Just death grip him and yank him out into the open. Those are two abilities that I expect to get nerfed. My point is that they haven't even gotten to balancing around PvP and arena yet.<br />
<br />
I don't think Blizzard is going to keep punishing hybrids for being hybrids, though. They seem to be looking at a particular spec and penalizing a spec based on whether or not it has utility or can be used for multiple purposes.<br />
<br />
Also, if they implemented dual specs in such a way you can switch on the fly, there wouldn't be a need for prot DPS. I'd like the idea of switching between prot and DPS at well, depending on the situation. However, that seems really unlikely.</div></div><hr />

Atm the game is lacking tanks, so making the tank role more attractive helps the game more in overall.<br />

<br />
<br />
That's because things still need to remain equitable to all the other classes. For example, as long as feral dps druids still can provide buffs. battle rez and innervate to the raid, they should never be able to do equal pure dps to a rogue (and probably fury warriors) as well.</div></div><hr />

Although there is the possibility that this won't happen - in that case they should buff us dps-wise. Not by letting us do even more damage (at a specific point furys get under the top3 damagedealers anyway, i for instance was putting out the by far most damage since our start in MH/BT), but by giving us more utility. That would mean taking away the increased damage taking penalty of zerk stance and giving us something that requires every raid to take atleast 2 dps warriors. Then I could live with not beeing the maintank, otherweise I vote for nerfing one spec of paladins and druids (e.g. their heal has to be reduced drasticly or their dps) to make it fair and have them QQ a little too :D</div></div><hr />

This is especially true in the 10 mans where a warrior doesn't bring as much utility as a druid. In Karazhan for instance, few bosses require more than one tank. If you brought a druid offtank, then you have the flexibility of good dps, innervate, buffs, and emergency heals. <br />
<br />
Unless you have a warrior that does godly DPS, I just don't see the situation where you would ever bring two warriors if you have one as your MT in the expansion's 10 man raids.</div></div><hr />

I play a prot warrior main, and I think some folks have been King of the Tanking Hill for too long. OT position not enough glory? Someone has to be OT and now that the playing field is being evened out so warriors are supposed to have an equal chance of being OT, warriors are complaining?! I doubt feral druids have much sympathy, really.<br />
<br />
Safeguard is one of the most powerful tools for OTing. A thirty second cooldown mini Shield Wall? Save that low health squishy right before an AoE? Improved Disarm for 2.2% increased raid damage (averaged). With decent amounts of strength in tank gear, it's not inconceivable that a warrior can swap into a semi-dps role midfight. Devastate's Sunder effect still has few (read one) equals and little opportunity cost, even Improved Expose Armor requires a combat rogue to give up their finisher cycle and you're still lacking a tank for whatever the warrior was tanking. Shouts are going raidwide, so even a prot warrior brings important buffs to the table, either Battleshout (a first-class AP buff) or Commanding Shout, equivalent to getting a second Fort buff.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for scaling and baseline parity. But insisting on a privileged MT position is going to fall rather flat.<br />
<br />
There are still improvements to be made in the Prot tree (I'm only talking about tanking here). Making Incite affect Devastate, etc. I hope Blizzard increases synergy with other tanks. It's a tanking team, people!</div></div><hr />

It seems that most of them only have two real raid specs (read:forms of play) and a PvP spec, instead of three separate play style specs. For instance, the live warrior's Arms tree looks terribly anemic to me. I've never played a warrior, but there are very few &quot;Wow!&quot; talents, as far as I can see. Rogues would be another example here. All the while, the hybrid classes all have three very distinct specs that dramatically differentiate the ways they play. <br />
<br />
It's nice to see that Priests are getting some Discipline love, making them a little more raid viable, but I would like to see the same happen to Rogues (as much as they are the bane of my existence), mages, and warriors. The new talent trees look significantly better than the live versions, but they still need a little work. <br />
<br />
To be honest, I think this whole rant stems from always having very similar group composition. I just like variety.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Puntar</div><div class="date">2008-08-13, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As long as their tanking and melee dps specs are mostly populated from the same talent tree, there is no reason at all for druids to be equal to the other tanks in pure boss tanking ability since they will continue to be more beneficial to the raid if they switch to doing dps if any extra tanks aren't needed after clearing trash. I think it is perfectly acceptable for them to be sub par in both roles as long as they can easily switch from one to the other to fill the situational needs of the raid. Just have to make sure that they don't get stuck in the situation of &quot;thanks for helping tank trash, but we really don't need you for the boss, so see you later,&quot; which they are already less likely to see than that extra prot warrior you brought along.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, 1 spec to rule them all ... NOT! But you forget that tanking feral gear is very different then feral dps gear. <br />
<br />
Not that much different than prot warrior in dps set. Sure you don't have MS and/or some other nice dps buffs but even like that you can outclass feral druid dps (in his own dps set) by quite a margin @ end game.<br />

I very much doubt that will change much in WotLK as I am pretty much sure that for tanking feral druid would still need to change at least half the gear (neck, back, both rings and trinkets) it not even entire set. <br />

<br />
In a perfect setup and all skilled players yes. Sadly that's not the case in my raid, so I'm way more useful as a fury that puts out insane DPS (compared to other classes, like 2,2k on Teron where the second position is around 1,6 - 1,7k).<br />

I can only speak for myself: I have no interest in running around waiting for something I may tank. Maybe it's ok for others but I won't do it.

He does not.<br />
I completely understand someone who has no interest in waiting around for something to off tank when (in this posters case, and a handful of excellent dps warriors) he could be specced differently and be doing very respectable damage, consistently.<br />
The reason why he can expect others to &quot;pick up his slack&quot; as you put it (really not applicable in his case since he's putting out 2.2K dps...) is because of players like myself who ENJOY doing what he does not want to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
A prot warrior/paladin is going to be collecting his offspec dps gear at the same rate that a bear will be collecting his, so your point doesn't matter. A feral druid's dps and tank specs share most of the same talents from a single tree, with some differences in what you take from the other two. If a warrior were to attempt to take as many dps talents with his tanking ones as a feral druid has available inherently, the warrior would just be weak at both. That's the thing, feral druids are much more versatile in their ability to switch between tanking and dps roles as the situation demands than any of the other tanking classes. Feral druids aren't specialists, and people who want to play as strictly one role or the other are missing the whole point.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, as long as the druid is capable of battle rezzing a dead healer or innervating somebody (something a MT is not likely going to have time to be doing) you might as well have the druid doing dps or be on add tanking duty as needed since they don't normally occupy your time the whole fight. Unless there was a fight where you just absolutely needed a druid to MT to even out lots of heavy spike damage (or some other special case reason), or you're farming and it doesn't matter, I would always put a warrior or paladin in the MT role before a druid.</div></div><hr />

from the begining of wow the prot. warrior was designt to be the best class, to tank and when we raided mc, bwl, aq40 and naxx, we allways had 2 prot, 1 prot/dps spec and 2 fully dps spec warriors.<br />
<br />
now you realy only need 1 warrior in a raid, cuz there are druides and pallys, that can tank now, and the dps warrior realy only gives commanding shout to the raid. a warlock or a rogue would do more dmg then the dps warrior.<br />
<br />
and when wotlk comes you don`t need the warrior any more because the dk, druide and pally can be main tanks now :( and the warrior just isn`t good enough at pve dmg to take with you in a 5 man or 10 man</div></div><hr />

Every class has gotten their buff times increased one way or the other they need to do the same for warriors. And before you even say warriors can spec to increase it, you can shove those pts where the sun don't shine. We shouldn't have to waste pts in a talent to increase the buff time since no other class has too. All they need to do is make it an aura or something like a hunters aspect so it just stays on until you die or change it.</div></div><hr />

I've never had a high level healer, but I've been told by several in my guild that they prefer healing druids over warriors and paladins, because druids generally take damage in a more consistent manner, rather than in spikes.

It is actually a lot easier to heal any tank that has a large health pool. In a 25 man raid situation you are going to be spam healing that one person unless you are assigned to heal the raid. This is why most tanks in a 25 man situation will favor larger stamina over increased avoidance. Druids are just a different tanking animal(pun intended) compared to most. They take more hits, but the armor boost helps to even it out. I'll be interested to see how DK's handle this since they are in much the same situation without a shield. With the reduced spell damage, they may be a great MT choice assuming they can handle the heavy melee bosses as well.</div></div><hr />

I'm fine with fact that we will now compete with 3 other classes for MT position on more equival terms(ofcourse, there will be fights which will ask for specific MT, but that isn't concern anyways). I wouldn't call warrior changes nerfs and other tank classes changes buffs IF and only IF we follow all new Blizzard philosophy &quot;lets make tanking more fun and equival&quot;.<br />
<br />
But i don't understand how they could downgrade &quot;THE MAIN ROLL&quot; of warrior AND give nothing instead ? Fury isn't more viable in WOTLK then in TBC (acording to beta testers), there were few changes in our arms and fury trees that can be called &quot;wierd&quot; at best, new 51 point talents are gimmicks for W3 fans... Ok, we DID get buffs to our 30min CD skills reduced to 5min CDs (even with effects nerfed, i do think those changes are still buffs).<br />
<br />
Really why make only tanking &quot;more fun&quot;, why not make dps &quot;more fun&quot;. (Sorry i'm gonna skip part about making healing more fun). <br />
<br />
Yes, we keep hearing that game isn't finished yet, that they are working on warrior class and so on, but guys, time is ticking away.. If they planned to boost our Pve DPS and viability, wouldn't they do it by now ?... Only way (and simplest way actually) to level playing field of fury/arms PvE build with other DPS classes is to give somekind of CC usuable only in PvE (and/or with reduced effect in PvP). Shamans and paladins did get one, i don't see reason why couldn't we get one ? Well, in worse case scenario, we can always Bladestorm of the edge of cliff and Heroic leap our way to safety...<br />

A Druid or Pally that's healing isn't going to be able to tank. A Pally might pull it off a bit better than a Druid, but even then, they might find themselves in some mail or leather pieces. A Druid is even worse off without the added armor and very little dodge with no agility.<br />
<br />
Likewise, a Druid or Pally that's tanking isn't going to be pulling out much in the way of heals. It's a full gear swap at a minimum and, even with that, you're not looking at a healer that's as good as their healing spec counterparts.<br />
<br />
A tank Druid tanks. A Tank Pally tanks. There's absolutely no reason why Warriors and DK's need to be better tanks than Druids and Pallys simply because they can be gimped healers. It's a weak excuse. Perhaps you should be asking for Fury/Arms buffs, then, rather than nerfs to two other tanking classes? It would certainly be a better way to go.<br />
<br />
No, this change is for the better. It will be better for guild progression if they're not so dependent on one or two people of a single class and it will mean a potential of gearing more than one main tank at a time if good drops can be spread among the classes. Each tanking class may have their bag of tricks that make them better for certain fights and that's fine. But not having to have any class as a mandatory tank for a boss is quite nice.</div></div><hr />

It also means more carbon-copy boss abilities since you can't have anything that isn't generic enough that it can't be countered by all of them.</div></div><hr />

There's a small downside to the individual vs. a large upside to the raid/guild. It's a trade off.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you'd end up having to put in gimmicky fights that Warriors could NOT tank. Which I wouldn't mind, really.<br />
<br />
You could stand to be a little creative, though. Certainly the 4 tanking classes won't be generic just due to the lack of Warrior-only gimmick fights that Warriors cheered about.</div></div><hr />

Yes! And mages main ranged DPS!<br />

The problem with this attitude is that when you create classes with unique abilities that others are lacking, you essentially say that you can't design anything to actually require their use or else it isn't fair to the others. Spell reflect is a unique warrior ability, but if you never designed any content where it mattered if it was even used, then why have the ability in the first place?</div></div><hr />

<br />
All correct, although the order from #1 to #8 isn't that much right ^^<br />
<br />
Noone if you are the #1 tank. If others become better or equally, you have to gain something from that.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I'm trying to point out is that class design shouldn't take that into account, because while individual players are free to declare &quot;MT or no tanking for me&quot;, designing any class around being the &quot;#1 MT because else I'll respec DPS&quot; is something that A) Blizzard has stated an intention not to, and B) completely unsustainable given that a player of any of the four declared tanking classes could demand such a thing, completely negating any argument about that.</div></div><hr />

Now lets think about this. Warriors get nerfed in tanking so they're exchangeable. Instead they get buffed in Fury/Arms dpswise. Ever played a DPS warrior? If they let us put out even more damage, the same thing that happened to mages regarding destro locks will happen to other melee classes. Why take a rogue if a warrior does so much more damage and can change gear and even tank a little?<br />
Warriors are unique to their scaling in game. We start as shitty dps, get &quot;ok&quot;, then do pretty nice damage and end up being one of the most powerful dps classes when the current content comes to his end (e.g. SWP for TBC). If that want to change this fact, then the warrior class dies - it would need so much tuning, that most of the aspect of the class will simply vanish. And now ask people who play warriors - do Fury or Arms warriors demand complete revamps of their specs wich result in us doing insanely more damage or do it earlier? I dont. I like it the way it is, I know it comes with DPS warriors having a very hard time to find a raid but It's ok, that's just what seperates us from warlocks for example. But when you take tanking now from us - and I know, we still could offtank and kill rats or so, seriously, we want to have some fun in the game and if some warriors say here that they would be happy to offtank, then they should think about a reroll or a break from raiding - we have nothing left in the current state of the game. Ok sure PVP - I shit on PVP. PVE dps? Read the above. I mean ok, let me put out easily 3k dps (compared to the current content) but prepare for flames you never saw so far ^^<br />
<br />
But basicly it's like someone above me said already: They didn't do much with the warrior yet. There are so many changes coming in that discussion about how they should do it is just for our personal entertainment - yeah, or do you really think they have no idea what to do and read all this to find it out? Blizzard is a litte more professional. ;)</div></div><hr />

What will end up happening is that there are fights that are made easier with one tank vs. another. It's already in TBC. Illidan can be tanked by a Paladin and even a Rogue. Druids have tanked fights with crushing blows. About the only two I haven't heard a Druid tanking are Kael and Illidan. Lots of pulls in TK, ZA, and Hyjal scream Prot Paladin.<br />
<br />
So a fight can be made where spell reflect is useful to the raid. If it's absolutely required (perhaps minus some cheesy tactic like having the tank soulstoned), quite honestly, it's a failure on the part of Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I'm quite aware of Fury Warrior scaling. Rather a reverse Druid. Hence why our guild leader is anxious to get a decent, stable Fury Warrior into the guild. And also why I've started one.<br />
<br />
The comment was more because someone had said that Warriors and DKs should be the best tanks because they can't heal. It's a silly and outdated notion. So, if said posted was suggesting that the raid viability of Fury either wasn't enough or wasn't good enough, I thought to point out requesting a buff. Of course, it doesn't have to be a dps buff. Warriors have the opposite scaling of Feral Druids.<br />
<br />
Some days, I just get the feeling that many people would be happier with a single tank class, a single healing class, and maybe 3 or 4 dps classes.</div></div><hr />

That would be nice. Blizzard has a strange way of fixing scaling issues, however.</div></div><hr />
