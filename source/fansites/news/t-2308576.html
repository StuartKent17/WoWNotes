Blue Tweets<br />
If I have 2 relics both with the Torment of the weak passive, do I get 2 separate stacks or more uptime on 1?<br />
When you have multiple relics with that trait, it's the damage that is increased. There should still only be one debuff on the target. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/909867754768891908))<br />

Game Developer Tweets<br />
Do you think there is a direct correlation between power without gameplay and lowered satisfaction?<br />
Absolutely, but it won’t manifest immediately. In the short term, being overpowered and hard to counter feels great. You’re winning a lot without having to work as hard at it. It’s a rush. But it’s a temporary sugar rush. Later you start to lose interest and aren’t sure why. <br />
<br />
It’s the same feeling the first time you turn on god mode on any game. I ran through Contra once with invincibility on and sort of lost interest. When I first went to work on WoW, I poked around in all of the raid instances to see how the bosses were actually built (like how did Deep Breath actually work), but it wasn’t fun to go around and one-shot them all with dev tools. Wooo. I’m so powerful. Crickets.<br />
<br />
I should also add that it’s possible to have abilities or mechanics that can still feel satisfying to use even if the champion overall has too much power without gameplay. Abilities that are responsive, that have good visuals and audio that match your expectations, and have good feedback, can be satisfying. That doesn’t mean the whole character package is though.

Oh how I miss having GC on the team at times.<br />
<br />
And the biggest problem is the last bit,<br />
'and aren't sure why'<br />
Which pretty much sums up the biggest issue with player feedback. Players are shortsighted and can't put a damn thing in perspective. Now GCs quote wasn't exactly talking about being &quot;too powerful&quot; in general compared to say world content or such, but I'll hijack his sentiment a bit.<br />
<br />
It manifests itself in feedback like &quot;No, I want leveling to be faster because I want it over with&quot;, instead of actually trying to figure out why they think leveling is so goddamned boring, twoshotting everything in your path for 72 hours. And no, having done it before is not the god of all rebuttals. Same with world content, no one is really advocating for harder mobs, tougher world elites, or tougher world bosses so you might actually benefit from grouping up. Or having to use more than your 2 main nuke spells. Because all you hear in return is how you want to inconvenience or slow down players.<br />
<br />
Same thing with Invasion Points which is yet another daily/weekly faceroll with absolutely no chance of failure. Pretty much the entire game outside of higher level M+ or raids is soloable. That. Is. Boring. You can't have an MMORPG where ALL challenging content is &quot;voluntary&quot;. <br />
<br />
Imagine what kind of game the typical non-raider faces in WoW today, especially as a new player. You destroy your way through leveling even without heirlooms as soon as you get a clue how to play, you faceroll dungeons without even having to care about your healthbar where your only interaction with other players is &quot;hi&quot;, there's nothing even remotely similar to strategy or tactics involved. Then you hit max-level and you have: Soloable world-content, queued heroics that are as faceroll as anything else. Weekly faceroll content like world bosses, Broken Shore bosses, Invasion Points. All just drop-in-and-faceroll with 0% chance of failure. Or Timewalking that more of the same but without the impact of gear. Or LFR which is yet another guaranteed-success. What kind of MMORPG design is this? Why is the game designed this way?<br />
And people still can't figure out why they feel bored.<br />
<br />
So WoW is stuck in a feedback loop that is only making the problems worse.<br />
<br />
And now a very sizeable portion of the game's community aren't really MMORPG players, but rather ARPG players that want to drop-in-and-play and get showered in instant gratification for an hour or two every few days and expect to be &quot;competitive&quot; on their 4 characters.<br />

You're absolutely right....so expect a few comments calling you an elitist and special snowflake...in 3...2...1<br />
<br />
the re-playability of any game is directly linked to challenge and difficulty. Unfortunately, GC presided over many of the changes that began the negative feedback loop in WoW...there were attempts to put the genie back in the bottle but we all know how that went....</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ArgusEliteTracker Addon is working on a Join Group/Create Group function which will join the Group of its rare you want to join.<br />
You can search for all rares by updating on the left top Corner, or by clicking on the rares-Name.<br />
<br />
Then there will be a join/create function on the left side of the Rares-Name, - Update in Progress and should be realease shortly as i know.<br />
Maybe it has allready been updated for this function.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should try World Quest Tracker (https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/world-quest-tracker#t1:description). Apart from letting you see world quests more clearly, it also allows you to create/search for group for them and (as of late) for rares you encounter (if you'll click on rare or it's corpse, you'll get a prompt to search for group).<br />
<br />
I personally use WQT+HandyNotes_Argus and I'd never trade it for ArgusEliteTracker. Tried the latter and didn't enjoy it one bit, IMO it's too clunky and takes too much screen space (not to mention it doesn't fit my UI).<br />
<br />
PS. If you'd also decide to go with WQT+HandyNotes, just remember to disable icons for rares created by WQT (&quot;Options&gt;Rare Finder&gt;Show Icons For Active Rares&quot; need to be checked off; you'll find options on your map window), as they cover more informative icons created by HandyNotes.</div></div><hr />

I really liked it, because it was extremely different and you could tell how much love the designers put into it. If you just rushed tru, well, you missed much. But if you took the time to read the quests, hear the comments and so on, it was a blast. And it was one of the xpacs that didn't take itself too serious. Remember the instance with the ale-ementals?

Don't get me wrong, we also had other xpacs with nice graphics, but MoP was special. No Naga, no Fell - something really new and unique. And that was what I really liked.</div></div><hr />

Yes exactly this. For me it felt like a brand new game, but with classes and the things I love from wow put into it. Humor helped a lot, and the music had both some epic feelings, and laid back panda brew style charm to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- They changed the talent trees to such an extent that the 'core' aspect of them, present since Vanilla, was completely taken away from players. Sure, there were cookie-cutter builds, but that hasn't changed with the new ones, has it? Alongside Cataclysm it was one of those expansions where pruning and dumbing the game down reached new levels. <br />
<br />
- It was extremely goofy. Fish-people, monkeys with bananas, drunk Panda-men, small rabbit-like creatures, etc. It was difficult to take it seriously. Blizzard always had fantastic humour, but this was always backed-up by an otherwise serious setting, Mists of Pandaria felt so over the top. <br />
<br />
- Scenarios. These were essentially AoE zergfests with little to no strategy or communication. They were just blind runs with zero interaction needed between players, hence they felt even worse than dungeons. <br />
<br />
- Zone design. Other than the Jade Forest and Kun Lai Summit, the other zones felt incredibly dull and looked sub-par. Specifically Dread Wastes (yuck), Townlong Steppes and the Krasarang Wilds. The zone design just didn't cut it out for me, including the quests and overall story. <br />
<br />
To each their own, but I really didn't like MoP. Perhaps it was an issue with me and not the game (i.e. I wasn't feeling the magic anymore and was burned out) but I can't say I miss it. I prefer the theme of Legion up until Argus. :)</div></div><hr />

Good question, you resumed pretty well what the expansion was. The game did go downhill in cataclysm, both lorewise and too much simplification (started dumbing down the game) but no doubt Mists keept the trend. I quit in the first weeks lorelol cataclysm came out, played a month of Mists of Pandamon and was finally done for good.<br />
<br />
I do ocasionally check news about the game but after all this years still don't see a reason to come back. Most friends quit a long time ago and the talent dumbification of trees are way, WAY too big for me to get over it.</div></div><hr />
