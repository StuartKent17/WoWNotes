true if a high enough percentage go to charity i'd buy it for the sake of doing a good deed.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully this one stays unique on the store, and nothing like it comes from a drop, or that would ruin the specialty from both mounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it's not to a charity, no way in hell am I buying a mount that everyone will have and everyone ELSE will just look down their noses at the people who bought it.<br />
<br />
Hopefully what someone earlier said about proceeds going to Tsunami victims will turn out to be true, but I'm not holding my breath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only &quot;confirmation&quot; I've seen that this money would be going to charity was a no-avatar poster on page 1.<br />
<br />
In the thread on their forums &quot;Blizzard, not helping out Japan?,&quot; a Blue replied thusly:<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, Blizzard is currently matching donations that employees make to the American Red Cross (https://american.redcross.org) on behalf of Japan. Many of us here are reaching into our hearts and wallets to help out, and it's really cool that those donations are being matched. We also /cheer the members of the community who have chosen to get involved with the relief efforts, be that through dollars, positive thoughts, or other forms of outreach. &quot;<br />
<br />
They said nothing in a thread ABOUT Blizzard helping Japan to indicate that they have any plans for this mount to go towards Tsunami victims.<br />
<br />
If you have a reliable source, I'd love to see it.</div></div><hr />

I'm rather tired of reading comments by random scrubs who think because more than a few people have an item it's no longer worthwhile. Not like putting it in-game would make much of a difference. PvE is hard herpderp. Now please stop complaining and go be productive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because mounts are only cool if you're the special snowflake riding it and nobody else gets it, right?<br />
<br />
Please. People need to get over it. A mount can be cool whether everybody's riding it or not. Go stand in SW/Org and flex your purples a little moar, kids. We're all really impressed by your pixels.<br />
<br />
I'd probably buy this mount anyway (because I think it looks nifty) but I'll definitely do it if proceeds go to charitable causes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because no one uses them ANYMORE, because they're not shiny and new, and got such a shit reputation. Remember what it was like when it was released? I would be good money that this mount will be EXACTLY like TRH, because 'everyone' will have it for the first several months, then no one will use it, and the people who actually like the way the mount looks will keep using it, and everyone who impulse bought will stop. Just like TRH.</div></div><hr />

I think the issue is the people who LIKE it, but don't like it enough to get laughed out of all major cities after buying it. So it &quot;ruins&quot; the mount for them, because they were hoping to connect something they thought looked really cool with doing something really cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a few types of people who are against the mount.<br />
<br />
1.) Kids who can't afford to buy it, so they convince themselves it's lame to cover the pain of not being able to buy it.<br />
2.) People who can afford to buy it, but they think it's lame and have to tell everyone how lame it is.<br />
3.) People who value mounts and epics as tangible real life achievements and can not simply be like everyone else.<br />
4.) People who think Blizzard is an evil mega-corporation and refuse to support it, but they are late for their raid invites so they have to go.<br />
5.) People who care what others think of them. They wouldn't be caught dead with it out of fear of being ridiculed, So, they go with the crowd and say &quot;It's lame!&quot;<br />
<br />
Honestly, if you don't like it. Don't buy it. What happens when you see a drink you don't like? Do you rage in the store and make fun of people who buy it?<br />
&quot;OMG! PEPSI IS SELLING VANILLA SODA! ONLY IDIOTS WOULD BUY THAT! LAWL!&quot; Come on people.</div></div><hr />

Back in vanilla you were stoked to be picking up a new obscure ring in AQ40...getting a piece of bis was truly an accomplishment as you actually had to compete and it only came along so often. Now you can pay $25 via an online store for a mount which it seems like blizzard has actually put effort into. Enjoy being suckers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a few types of people who are against the mount.<br />
<br />
1.) Kids who can't afford to buy it, so they convince themselves it's lame to cover the pain of not being able to buy it.<br />
2.) People who can afford to buy it, but they think it's lame and have to tell everyone how lame it is.<br />
3.) People who value mounts and epics as tangible real life achievements and can not simply be like everyone else.<br />
4.) People who think Blizzard is an evil mega-corporation and refuse to support it, but they are late for their raid invites so they have to go.<br />
5.) People who care what others think of them. They wouldn't be caught dead with it out of fear of being ridiculed, So, they go with the crowd and say &quot;It's lame!&quot;<br />
<br />
Honestly, if you don't like it. Don't buy it. What happens when you see a drink you don't like? Do you rage in the store and make fun of people who buy it?<br />
&quot;OMG! PEPSI IS SELLING VANILLA SODA! ONLY IDIOTS WOULD BUY THAT! LAWL!&quot; Come on people.<br />
Oh PLEASE dont..</div></div><hr />

Back in vanilla you were stoked to be picking up a new obscure ring in AQ40...getting a piece of bis was truly an accomplishment as you actually had to compete and it only came along so often. Now you can pay $25 via an online store for a mount which it seems like blizzard has actually put effort into. Enjoy being suckers.<br />

This mount seems to use the Hyppogryph skeleton so...its not THAT unique. Its sort of a generic clone in itself. Heck I think they took some of the Lion NPC model to help make this. Its no a PURELY unique mount at all.</div></div><hr />

So by that reasoning, if you saw a car you really thought was cool and you would like. You wouldn't buy it because other people would buy it? Grow up. Stop worrying about the &quot;Jones&quot;. Too many people in this game worry about what other people think or do.</div></div><hr />

I like it, but I would rather see these awesome mount models used for big accomplishments in PvP, PvE, achievements or something in-game. I'd still buy less cool or unique mounts off the store though lol<br />
<br />
There are hundreds of in-game mounts. There are 2 purchasable mounts. I think this option is stacked in favor of pvp, pve, achieves in-game.</div></div><hr />

No that would be horrible! it doesn't fit with the theme of firelands at all. Mount looks are cosmetic, so make a firelands mount... fiery?<br />

Look at it this way. Would you rather it drop off of some raid that you will never... ever... get (except for the 1% who are lucky enough to do so)? <br />

<br />
The profits? No. Half the total value of the sales went to charity. Blizzard kept the other half, which you can be sure was a hell of a lot more than what it cost to model, texture, implement and sell.</div></div><hr />

I know these forums have a ton of mods, so I can only ask the question why you`re not like other websites I know of that I visit that if you in any way say or do things to make people troll or say stupid shit, you get a warning then a ban. Opinions are great, if they`re constructive and not one sided. I`ve looked at a few of the people on the past page or twos last posts, and all I`ve seen was them whining and saying &quot;e-z mode&quot; and a bunch of other worthless things, seriously, if all you do is complain you really have no business here.</div></div><hr />

Since the Japanese (for some odd reason) are one of the only developed countries that did not embrace WoW, I don't see that happening.</div></div><hr />

Do you have a snow globe?<br />
Do you have novelty hats?<br />
Do you have a cat? Or any pet other than a dog or a horse, for that matter?<br />
Do you have any jewellery?<br />
<br />
If you've answered yes to any of those, you shouldn't have a problem with TRH/L. A cat, necklace, snake, medieval jester hat or a snow globe of somewhere you've never been all serve the same purpose as TRH/L. They're just cosmetic. I suppose you could argue that a cat shows you affection (It doesn't, by the way, but whatever) or that jewellery shows off your status as someone with money (Spectral Tiger says hi), but that boils down to what other people infer from your appearance. <br />
<br />
Personally, I really don't get why (On my realm at least) TRH is looked down upon so heavily when buying a new coat or some bling is apparently something all the cool kids do every day. It really baffles me. Personally, I wouldn't pay $25 for a ring for myself, ever. I don't like them, they don't suit me, etc. Why people say &quot;OMFG TRH IS FOR LUUUSERZ XD&quot; rather than &quot;Naw I don't like it&quot; is beyond me. /Endrant.</div></div><hr />

I can't see them donating ALL of the proceeds to Japan. That'd just be stupid on Blizzard's part. But I can see them donating a portion of the proceeds to the disaster relief efforts in Japan, and I would love it if they did.</div></div><hr />

My opinion aside, however, I fail to see why it being in the cash shop is such a terrible thing to you people. It's not as if the coolness of it changes or anything. Frankly, I won't be getting it, as it looks fugly, but if you like it, who cares if everyone else has one? The same thing happened with TRH, too. It got datamined, everyone's all excited, &quot;it's gunna be the best mount evurs!&quot; But, oh, wait, it's a cash shop mount - everyone can get it, and thus it sucks ass. If you like the lion, buy it. Everyone else having the lion changes nothing about the lion.<br />
<br />
And think of it this way - the first week of TRH, everyone was riding it. Now, I only see my brother use it, because he genuinely likes it. So, if you like the lion, buy it. If you want it for the rarity, buy it, because you can bet your ass in a couple months everyone will simply be back to riding drakes again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sigh Blizzard <br />
:@<br />
<br />
P.S: I honestly dont mind the idea of the Blizzard store buying pets, But mounts, espically as cool as this one in my opinion should be obtained though the game, not so any player with his/her mom/dad's debit/credit card can buy it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vallius</div><div class="date">2011-03-22, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here we go again! More whiny babies bashing Blizzard for making something that people like.<br />
<br />
I don't get why people cannot see the benefit something like this has for everyone involved:<br />
<br />
1. Blizzard knows people like/want sweet mounts.<br />
2. Blizzard makes a sweet mount. <br />
3. Blizzard puts said mount in their store so everyone can buy one if they so choose.<br />
4. People buy the sweet mount from the store.<br />
<br />
Result? - Blizzard makes money and you get a sweet mount. Shame on them for making money off of you! &quot;Fuck you, Blizzard, wah!! I need my dai-py changed!&quot; Grow up, people. Take your failed attitudes somewhere else. Like Runescape. Or Call of Duty.<br />
<br />
Some people obviously don't feel special in real-life so they want to say they've &quot;Earned&quot; something in WoW by doing something that is &quot;hard&quot;. In WoW, mounts *can* be one of those badges of leetness you can EARN, but some can be purchased (gasp!) for a nominal fee. In all honesty, the complainers need take this one as what it is - A $25 mount that you can get without spending time in-game to get it. That's it, people. That's all it is. If you love the mount, buy it. If you hate the mount, don't buy it, but don't go throwing the &quot;I see Blizzard needs more money! Everyone's gonna have it! I won't be special! I want ta be teh special mount guy in SW! Baddies iz gunna hav it 2!&quot; card(s) around. If they make something like this it's for the player's benefit as much as it is Blizzard's. That's how companies work. <br />
<br />
If the proceeds from this mount go to the Japanese relief effort that's icing on the cake. Or the Dough itself. Or, fuck it, the whole cake! Whatever your reasons are for buying it, (mount collection, want to help out a cause (if that turns out to be true - still waiting on an official source)) it's still a win-win.</div></div><hr />

Except the Celestial Steed looks completely stupid, this looks a little bit cooler. Though I was hoping it would be a Tol'vir discovery through Archaeology, not a 25 dollar account bound mount, though I'd prefer it over other mounts for lower level characters.<br />
<br />
Edit: And if people want this mount but don't want to pay cash for it, you can probably trade about 75k gold to buy one.</div></div><hr />

Where do you see this 'road' exactly? I've only seen vanity items sold in the Blizzard Store thus far, and there aren't even that many of them. There has been no hint whatsoever that they will be selling anything that impacts your performance in any way in the Blizzard store. Wild speculation is bad, mmkay.</div></div><hr />
