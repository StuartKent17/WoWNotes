They're &quot;new&quot; diffs, instead of waiting for 1/2 hours to see the changes on the front page, you get them pretty much instantly as soon as I get my hands on the PTR build. Then I just update with the regular list of changes when I'm done making a nice list. <br />
<br />
It helps a lot preventing screw ups because I try to rush a list, and it gets the info faster to the users.</div></div><hr />

Arms getting more damage... sigh... Arms will inevitably end up like a gib heavy CD based spec like Enhance shamans are and will become utterly crap and boring to play. High damage doesn't fix Arms fucking problems. I don't know why the bother trying to make Arms viable in PvE when it's always been inferior to Fury. Arms has always been the PvP and should remain the PvP spec. Their plans to bring Fury into PvP and Arms into PvE have continuously back fired and have just raped both specs of their fun. Unless ofc you're a drooling retard who likes watching big numbers fly and then complains they can't break 1500+ in 3's without rolling dispelcleave or TSG. Charge buff is just fucking dumb. Just reduce the cooldown of heroic leap to 30s and fix its fucking pathing. This would fix the problem with ping ponging pre-4.0.6 who just use focus macro to ping pong targets and think they're good. And spell reflect, what the fuck. The ability BARELY works when you need it now anyway. How many times have you been caught in a CC you saw casting only to be caught by it and your spell reflect going up. Its clunky as fuck to use anyway. The only way I can see them being serious with this change is if they remove the shield requirement which would lower the skill for warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's much better ways to up PvE DPS that don't cause people to get one and two-shotted in PvP.<br />
You realize that the amount they will have to buff our other abilities to make up for this massive mastery nerf will just result in you getting two shotted anyway? I'm predicting this change isn't even going to go in.</div></div><hr />

Way more rep grinding than needed? On my main I have completed all the Cataclysm reps as well as Gilneas. I can't get rep with any other faction at this point. And it wasn't like I was running instances trying to get the rep either. I was gearing up and doing heroics with guildies.<br />
<br />
My alts don't have the rep, but then again they are alts. I'm not going to be focusing on that. Any person who &quot;worked&quot; to get this achievement previously will no doubt not have trouble getting either Gilneas or Bilgewater to exalted if they haven't already done so.</div></div><hr />

Raising warrior DPS through auto attack damage is the right approach to avoid PVP burst issues, but it's not enough. Warriors are at the bottom of DPS charts in every raid setting according to websites such as stateofdps and raidbots. While warrior PVP burst may need a nerf, PVE DPS needs a buff even prior to all these planned nerfs. Other areas where DPS can be raised without PVP issues are OH damage granted by Fury specialization (Fury gets +25% while Combat rogues get +75% for example), and Deep Wounds bleeding damage. Another option is raising Bloodsurge proc chance and making it a stacking buff. This will allow filling free GCDs with Slam a lot more consistently without raising PVP burst. Currently proposed changes look to be an overall DPS nerf to a class that's already struggling to stay competitive in PVE, further compensations are needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With this change though, I really, really hope they increase the HP/mana you get with reincarnate (even if the keep the cooldown at 30 minutes). With just 10% its far too easy to get instantly gibbed after rezing, where your raid can then blame you for rezing instead of waiting for a DK or druid to do it for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're aware you can only use one battle rez in 10 man and 3 in 25 man right? No point in having long cooldowns. The 30 min. is because it's a self rez and require no coordination.<br />
<br />
Edit. I guess you do realize the limited rez per fight, which kinda answers your own question.</div></div><hr />

Where do you get bottom of the charts? Fury warriors are pretty consistent with being near the middle of the pack, not bottom.</div></div><hr />

Right now, i'm going Crit &gt; Mastery &gt; Hit when above 8% hit or so. This will put me back to Crit &gt; Hit &gt; Mastery.<br />
<br />
Recently i've followed the following:<br />
Hit &gt; Crit &gt; Haste &gt; Mastery<br />
Crit &gt; Hit &gt; Mastery &gt; Haste<br />
Crit &gt; Mastery &gt; Hit &gt; Haste<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind so much, but there's a massive difference between Crit and any other secondary stat, and i can't stack Crit on everything, as most items come with 2 secondary stats... One mostly useless.<br />
<br />
Every time it changes, i have to reforge, swap out gear and dance around to collect and build a better set to dps with, and each time i lose a little bit of dps overall. <br />
<br />
All of this, because Fury has fairly good burst in PvP on 0 Resilience targets? Something's gotta give...<br />
<br />
EDIT: And with the mastery nerf, they also nerfed one of our dps cooldowns too, Death Wish. It just gets better...</div></div><hr />

L2P, resto druids are op as hell right now in both pvp and pve. This coming from a resto druid. We all hate nerfs but this is so minor i dont think you'll notice much. The mana cost hurts a little on LB but the bloom was nerfed like 3k hp mine does 48k atm.<br />
<br />
People were crying foul when rejuv was put back to 20% base mana from 16% did it change much? In my experience, not really.<br />
<br />
Your int will go up so will your mana and mana regen, and your heals will get more powerful.<br />

L2P? You need to L2Math. 20% of 48K is 9.6K, that's not minor. Especially since you can only roll that joint on one person non-ToL.</div></div><hr />

Combat rogues are fine. In fact they're topping the charts on fights where they can cleave, and they're barely behind assassination in single target dps if behind at all. Beast Master Hunters are actually one of the best dps spec's now if played right, they're just behind hard cast aimed mm.<br />
<br />
Subtlety never has been a pve spec, never should be, Don't care. Same with frost mages, and arms warriors. Don't care. My main is an arms warrior, every time they try to change arms in some way to be better in pve they ruin it for pvp. No ty. You wanna dps as a warrior in raids, you go fury. Arcane mages? It's not as bad as people make it out to be, it's quite a bit behind fire but it's not to the point where it's completely unviable.<br />
<br />
Frost dks are fine, unholy is just better, usually some other class brings the haste buff so they're not missed. Who cares? And being that locks are a pure dps class, I'm not the least bit concerned that one of their trees isn't super good in pve right now.<br />
<br />
Shamans are pretty much useless in raids all around though unless they're healers. That's just the truth. Plenty of better classes to bring along.<br />

Look I'm clearly trolling here but...if you're serious you have got to be the worst caster ever in the game. It so easy to fake a warrior into wasting his spell reflect, and latency and other issues have always made the ability very unwieldy. It has never been OP, it's never even been anything commonly complained about at all. And worse off: it was nerfed completely for pve purposes, not pvp. It was giving prot warriors more incoming rage than Blizzard liked. Pretty dumb change.</div></div><hr />

Wait a minute... they nerfer Rejuv, Regrowth and Nourish so that Resto wouldn't be so strong in raid healing, and buffed LB so he would be a better tank healers... Now they nerf LB so what now... Rubbish raid and rubbish tank healer? Blizz just stop messing with druid healing and switch him back to normal with normal tree form and normal HoTs... He always was a perfect raid healer with a bit of a tank healing capability and everyone who picked druid healing knew about that...</div></div><hr />
