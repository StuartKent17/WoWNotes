<br />
Old Character Models<br />
Since we are being blessed with new character models (Which can be disabled? Yes, no?)<br />
Yes, if you set your graphics quality to Low.<br />
<br />
However, I am quite useless on Ordos and Sha since my frame rates dips to 1-10 FPS. Will the new models cause even more problems in world bosses and even in regular raids?<br />
It's hard to say exactly, many things can influence performance.<br />
<br />
Remember that characters aren't (usually) naked inside raids, which means that most of the polygons and textures being drawn and rendered aren't exclusively attributable to player models, but also to armor. <br />
<br />
On top of that, raids have their own surrounding geometry, bosses, etc... and all that adds up in the end. Obviously, new (more detailed) models means slightly more processing power is required, but new models aren't the only big change coming to WoD.<br />
<br />
We are also applying a squish to anything related to stats; this means that in certain situations, there might be some performance improvements, especially when it comes to addons that process combat data.<br />
<br />
More importantly, we are reducing the amount of visual clutter that currently fills every fight where a lot of players are involved.<br />
Less sparkly stuff flying around means better video performance for everyone.<br />
<br />
Client performance is something we care about a lot. It doesnâ€™t matter how well-designed an encounter is: you arenâ€™t going to have fun raiding at 8 FPS. We want everyone to be able to enjoy playing with the new models, and our dev team is working hard making sure that WoW is as resource efficient as possible in order for that to happen.<br />
<br />
Shall I start looking for a new computer or should I stick with the one I have?<br />
That's a hard question to answer. I'd say that you shouldn't be worried about any big drop in performance; things will most likely remain very close to what you are experiencing right now. So if you're satisfied with what you have right now, then there shouldn't be any need to change anything.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Racials<br />
&quot;Undead can no breath underwater indefinitely&quot; Was that really needed?<br />
Absolutely. Definitely the most important (and time-consuming to make) change in all of Warlords. #sarcasm (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451893761941856257))<br />
<br />
Whatever happened to Touch of the Grave rescaling? Must Undead really be the worst PvE race?<br />
No -- we'll tweak as needed to make sure their throughput is on par with other races'. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/451894510641889280))<br />

I understand you want to tone down blood's reactivity (that's now a word), but be warned that you could ruin why we love it.<br />
There are significant changes; we're taking it very seriously and are eager for feedback about how it feels. We know the risk. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451892827752906752))<br />
<br />
So DKs will have no zero ranged abilities with removal of Death Coil? Or, Rune&amp;Frost Strikes can be used at range?<br />
Icy Touch, Howling Blast, Death and Decay, Death Siphon, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451895045751189505))<br />

The hurricane/Shroom combo is horrible. we need something powerful and immediate, not 3 casts praying the mobs won't be moved.<br />
You can pre-water your Shrooms if you want. That's *extremely* powerful and immediate. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451895777036484608))<br />
<br />
I can think of a half-dozen spells to remove (mostly Balance &gt;.&gt;) Innervate? :|<br />
In many ways Innervate (and Divine Plea as another example) was just something you could amortize into a passive mp5 effect. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/451895325590966272))<br />
Wouldn't it make sense to remove MTT as well given that 75% nerf to others effectively makes raid benefit marginal?<br />
MTT is more iconic, and homogeneity isn't great either. Keeping MTT suits the ideal of shamans' bolstering their allies. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/451899176607965185))<br />
<br />
where is balanced in the Druid section?<br />
No direct changes, but some changes via talents and perks. See the talents and perks on MMO-C and Wowhead. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451899204680441856))<br />

.Also, it seems as if the redesigned Brain Freeze would make Glyph of FFB mandatory for Frost. Do we expect a change to glyph?<br />
That glyph is Fire-only. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451889598298218496))<br />
<br />
Just read the current WoD patch notes. Not a word about changes to mages' fire spec. Still working on it?<br />
Several talents changed. We like Fire's core rotation, though there are a couple tweaks to it in the Draenor Perks. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451893582266241024))<br />

Will surging's mana cost be reduced in light of soothing not generating chi anymore?<br />
We'll be extensively changing mana costs so that things work out, don't worry. We know that with current state it wouldn't work. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451890700380946432))<br />
<br />
Surging Mist in WoD, cast time or instant for Windwalkers and Brewmasters? Instant please <br />
Cast time. Not intended to be used mid-rotation with no DPS loss. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451892584613306368))<br />
<br />
Any reason why SoTWS doesn't cause eminence? Xuen is going to be kinda awful for mistweavers<br />
Xuen always Eminences, regardless of your own stance. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451894257368854528))<br />
<br />
So if SOOM doesn't generate Chi, what does?<br />
Surging, Renewing, Expel, Chi Brew, Spinning Crane Kick, Jab. I think that's it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451891158323445760))<br />
I see, with the scarcity difference will it not be a concern if Monks switch to crane specifically to build mana tea?<br />
We are 100% committed to making sure that there's no cherry-picking between Serpent/Crane. We'll adjust as necessary if so. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451891681059540993))<br />
Also, is Muscle Memory now passive? It makes no sense to have it activate on Jab anymore with it being only in crane stance<br />
See the Muscle Memory note in the patch notes. Merged into one passive. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451897821034061824))<br />

I also... I... Subtlety rogues using FoK will be DROWNING in combo points. I don't even.<br />
Yep. That'll be an interesting change to see how it plays out. We'll pull back on it if it ends up too strong, but trying it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451890604528525312))<br />

You're overloaded right now, but a gentle nudge on this q if you're able: Is Blade Flurry undergoing a new round of changes?<br />

Will Resto Shamans keep the stacked healing niche going into WoD?<br />
They'll certainly be good at stacked healing, but they need a well-rounded toolkit to complement that strength. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/450798702550986753))<br />
Shamans rock at stacked, but too few strats use stacked groups :/<br />
Stacking is the default strat on pretty much every fight unless we add mechanics to make you not do so. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/450909244229836801))<br />
<br />
Haven't been at Blizz long huh? I guess you don't remember what ele was like before LB was changed to allow casting while moving<br />
I've been here longer than Unleashed Lightning existed. You now have several spells that you can cast while moving. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451890901095182336))<br />
<br />
&quot;Restoration Shaman..with buffs elsewhere to keep them competitive.&quot; Why are none of these buffs mentioned in the blog?<br />
Because we didn't mention most of the -/+X% Healing Done or -/+X% Mana Cost changes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451893370885910529))<br />
<br />
Will Improved Lightning Shield mean 8 charge Fulminations, or are you capping that at 6?<br />
8 charge. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451895860532494336))<br />
<br />
LB on the move was a much more reliable source of damage, we're already one of the weakest casters, this doesn't help at all.<br />
You won't be one of the weakest casters. We'll be tuning your damage (hasn't happened yet) to equal other casters. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451897079795695617))<br />
<br />
Will Elemental still be able to cast LB while moving? It's critical for Elemental's pvp, without we will have no dmg output.<br />
No, but we're balancing around that, don't worry. There are actually several spells you can cast while moving (instants). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451899529973866497))<br />

is a 5% buff to nightfall going to be enough to offset the loss of drain soul?<br />
It's intended to make gameplay more similar between cases where you have adds to kill (way too strong) and you don't. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451891490629754880))<br />

Warlock: &quot;Soulshatter has been removed&quot; I rely on this a LOT to give aggro back to my demons which are designed to take my aggro<br />

Curious about the Shadowburn change to not generate mana. Without a cast time there's no mana regeneration like with Chaos Bolt.<br />
Cast time isn't really mana regeneration. It was unnecessary complication. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451898981967081472))<br />

id say it has something to do with Role selection for bg's! it would use the same system as dungeons and that is why long queues<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qualinas</div><div class="date">2014-04-16, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, some of the worst designed elements so far out of WoD seem to be hitting the Balance Druid. Celestalon's comment about Enhanced: Mushrooms just reinforces the downright hypocrisy and gameplay bias in some of these talents and perks. <br />
<br />
You may recall the quality-of-life change added in 5.4 that sped up Eclipse bar preparation. Now with Enchanced: Mushrooms one gets to channel 6 (SIX), that's an entire minute when not factoring in haste, of Hurricanes/Astral Storms to prepare for a single pull, that may or may not be utilized to its fullest due to a third party (tank). At best, it is only useful in a highly synchronized dungeon or raid group, and at worst it finds little to no use in solo pvp, organized pvp, and solo pve.<br />
<br />
Level 100 Balance talents are a joke, plain and simple:<br />
Sunfall - This should have been in the game for over five years now, it's just lazy to have in take up a talent today. The gameplay design of Eclipse has been lopsided since Starfall's addition in WotLK and became even further lopsided with the removal of Insect Swarm. <br />
Insect Swarm - this new version seems interesting at first, but it is a GCD hog in disguise and one of the most contradictory abilities one could imagine. The intention is to cast Insect Swarm immediately after leaving Eclipse to facilitate the next Eclipse. Strike one: Not in Eclipse, no benefit from mastery, completely contradicts the spec's core gameplay. Strike two: to (hypothetically) benefit from mastery one has to recast Insect Swarm prior to entering only Solar Eclipse, in many cases timing the recast between ticks of itself. Strike three: Consumes two GCD's every non-Eclipsed state.<br />
Equinox - Again, contradiction of the spec's core gameplay. This is equivalent to a talent that gives unlimited Shadow Orbs or Demonic Fury. That may sound good at first, but it begs the question, why have Eclipse in the first place if it's contribution of gameplay to the spec is written off so easily?</div></div><hr />

It may not look real, but I've got a friend who had to be opened up when he was little, he has an upside down Y on his torso, starting a bit above each hip and ending just above the breastplate.

The change in WoD is supposedly the biggest advancement in visuals ever for the game and the representative beats around the bush about whether or not this user should upgrade/purchase a new system...<br />
<br />
It is so irritating when at launch, you purchase the game to realize that the only way you can play is if you zoomed into the ground.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriosuly: why bitch about this? Get a job and buy a real computer that can handle games. As unemployed I could still save up enough money to buy a computer.<br />
Blizzard are already trying too much to make sure people with computers from the 90s can play the game. Should just leave them all behind.</div></div><hr />

The thing about Skyrim and similar graphics is that they want to be real...and are still far from real. It always feels fake somehow. On pics it looks like they used photoshop to roughly cut out the buildings and glue them into the backround. <br />
I prefer consistent graphic that generate a world over better graphics that are inconsistent and give you the feeling that you are running through a photobook instead of a real world.</div></div><hr />

Why is there still people who think WoW should look better than Skyrim just because it's 2012, or 2013, or 2014.<br />
<br />
If you want improvement, compare classic/bc to WoD models.<br />
Thing is, they aren't remotely going for the 2014 look-at-all-the-pixels look in WoW.<br />
<br />
And anyone who has given it any thought should have figured that out instantly.</div></div><hr />

In other words blizzard has just given the alliance a massive honor piÃ±ata extravaganza. The minute you see undead in pvp its like finding a rare out in the open. Free honor and goodies await for killing the poor sap who decided it was a good idea to go undead.</div></div><hr />

Updated screenshots among other information about Warlords of Draenor. Looks like we lost another raid tier folks.<br />
<br />
At this point we've lost all raid tiers.<br />
<br />
Now it's to the point that those screenshots above are the only parts of the zones we're getting. If we keep this up they'll need another 50 bucks to keep any quests in. Then another 50 to add some mobs back in.</div></div><hr />

The first one is from WoD Alpha and is the Blizzard picture of the day - just check the MMO Champ main page.<br />

The Ogre model is most likely a placeholder, since it's from Cataclysm. See my earlier posts in this thread. So no, he wasn't wrong.</div></div><hr />

Since the model is demonstrably at least 4-ish years old, that is my guess, yes. But hey, if they're happy with the way it looks and decide to use it for real, I wouldn't complain. It's pretty cool.</div></div><hr />

Or how about we compare games that actually make sense and have similar artstyles to prove that the graphics are pretty up to par. Wildstar is a next gen game so obviously it'll have 2014 graphics right? well let's see here...<br />
<br />
Next Gen Graphics:<br />

<br />
WoW Graphics:<br />

Next Gen Graphics:<br />

<br />
WoW Graphics:<br />

<br />
It's called an art style. The cartoony look is a design choice, not the game's engine limits. They could go hyper-realistic if they wanted to, but WoW still has to support computers dating back to when the game came out in 2005, while Skyrim doesn't. Plus if WoW went skyrim or GW2 graphics, it wouldn't be WoW anymore. It wouldn't have the iconic look from Warcraft III that carried over into World of Warcraft. <br />
<br />
Sure you could say that these just have similar graphics, but if WS is a next gen game then their graphics are as up to date as any other game which proves that WoD is up-to-date as well. Stylized or &quot;Cartoony&quot; graphics =/= Bad. Super HD Photo-Realism =/= Good.</div></div><hr />
