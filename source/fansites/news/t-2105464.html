lol - yes, convenience and fun in a video GAME is the last thing that should be included? A choice to fly is better than no choice - you don't have to use a flying mount if you want to be immersed while being dazed off your ground mount while riding up the same mountain for the millionth time.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has stated that they fucked up trying to bring out faster Expacs and failed (Warlords)<br />

I work an 8 hour job 5 days per week, I spend an extra 2-3 hours preparing and travelling between my home and my job. That's up to 11 hours per day when I am unable to play the game. I had a though time getting prepared for raids or other content, but I never complained about lack of convenience and I managed to balance my time to keep up with the rest of my guild.<br />
<br />
It's a game, you're meant to abide the rules and limitations that are imposed upon you.<br />
World of Warcraft is not some &quot;to-do list&quot; where you are entitled to see every piece of content, complete every achievement and own every item in the game just because you &quot;pay to play&quot;.<br />
<br />
If lack of time is hindering you from enjoying the game, then perhaps the wisest thing to do is stop paying for the game, don't demand convenience thinking it will provide extra value for your money.</div></div><hr />

Eh like I said different tastes for everyone. On topic this kind of patching is fine. Odd number patches medium sized with small ones inbetween and Even numbered the major ones. That's perfect. It's close to what FF14 does and it allows pacing while adding in minor content to tide people over.</div></div><hr />

And just because you do not like it does not mean others immediately don't. You do not speak for every player. This kind of pacing is what WoW needs. Odd numbered medium patches like 7.1, small patches in between then the Even numbered ones a major patch with small ones in between.</div></div><hr />

How so? The MoP dungeons were well received especially on Challenge Modes. Timewalking is a side content nothing more and it can help with alt gearing but there are just as good methods to gear an alt these days anyway.</div></div><hr />

That's like your opinion man. I thought MoP was quite good. Especially Throne of Thunder which is arguably one of the best tiers introduced. Siege was quite good as well it just lasted too long as final tiers have done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup. Same thoughts here. Unless they are going to give out some 7.2 info soon then this is extremely lackluster. Instead of giving out new content faster, they seem to just be working on the illusion of content by adding little things that are more like hotfixes, but doing it frequently. Timewalking MoP and Brawlers Guild are just content that should have been out at release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except getting a lot of content in few big patches = getting very little content spoonfed in a lot of small patches. It's just a psychological difference at this point. <br />

There goes the whole Azshara raid for 7.2 theory then. There will be one more after which I assume will be Sargeras or a different big bad. They did say 3 tiers.</div></div><hr />

Pacing is a big deal. Players get worn out feeling like they sometimes have too much to do and other times have nothing to do. Eliminating those peaks and valleys makes players less susceptible to burnout.</div></div><hr />

I dunno guessing Sargeras himself. I just don't think he will be fought in Tomb it just seems to early.</div></div><hr />

Yeah Siege was awesome imo. Norushen, Galakras, Juggy, Shamans, Siegecrafter and Garrosh were some pretty cool fights. I probably enjoyed Siegecrafter the most because I always got to go on the conveyor belt :)</div></div><hr />

No not at all. Just means we are going to the Tomb earlier than expected. They said way before Legion was released we are getting a 3 tier xpac. Alright the base thing like Quel'danas sounds pretty interesting I'll admit. Also seems flying is coming back.</div></div><hr />

EN isn't a raid tier. Nighthold is the first official raid tier. EN is the equivalent of Highmaul in WoD or Mogushan in MoP basically. Also good on the new achievement that it's purely outdoor content. Pathfinder part one should never have been gated by raiding.</div></div><hr />

It's a game, you're meant to abide the rules and limitations that are imposed upon you.<br />
World of Warcraft is not some &quot;to-do list&quot; where you are entitled to see every piece of content, complete every achievement and own every item in the game just because you &quot;pay to play&quot;.<br />

If lack of time is hindering you from enjoying the game, then perhaps the wisest thing to do is stop paying for the game, don't demand convenience thinking it will provide extra value for your money.<br />

If you read what the guy said, he was saying no we don't Shut up basically saying everyone wants what he does which is BS. If you do not want flying that is fine, you don't have to, but if you want to fly hey! the option is there.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, everyone that says they do not want flying and it should be removed from the game, you basically want it to be what you want for everyone. But if they put flying in but now make it mandatory to get, then everyone wins. Then it becomes, I do not like flying so I do not want to get the pathfinder. Or I do want flying so I am going to work on getting it. <br />
<br />
One way half wins and half looses. The other way everyone wins.</div></div><hr />

More convenience is the last thing this game needs. It's a fucking MMORPG, not some social virtual life simulator where you should take everything for granted.<br />

<br />
You implied I might have more time to play than others, I provided a counterargument to your assumption.<br />
<br />
Flying does save you time, but it also makes all the activities you do less meaningful. Surge in resources on the Ah means the value of all the &quot;extra&quot; mats you farmed has gone down. <br />
<br />
You just killed some rare mob on some obscure mountain peak with the only path of access being a jump puzzle? Guess what: NOONE FUCKING CARES ANYMORE, it's just another tick on a To-do list because everyone can point their character towards the mob's location and press both mouse buttons...<br />
<br />
Flying brings no value to the game in any way, it creates the perception that you have more time to do relevant things in game, when in fact it just accelerates the rate at which people will go on the forum to complain about having exhausted all relevant content.<br />
<br />
I am saying this here: IF BLIZZARD IS PLANNING TO INTRODUCE FLYING IN THE BROKEN ISLES THEY NEED TO CONSIDER READJUSTING THE RATE AT WHICH WORLD QUESTS SPAWN OR THE NUMBER OF WORLD QUESTS AVAILABLE ON THE MAP AT A GIVEN TIME.</div></div><hr />

Further empower your Artifact, new traits, including a gold border one, three points with utility. Also allows you to put another point into all of your three point traits. 15 new points to be added. More Artifact Knowledge coming.</div></div><hr />

I would absolutely love this. I don't want our first encounter with Sargeras in a raid to be us winning. We get fucked and run the hell away while fighting something (it still needs to be a fight).<br />

Maybe we go inside the portal where Sargeras is and try to close it while avoiding him as best we can as to not get completely annihilated.</div></div><hr />

My dislike for the mythic+ system and timed stuff in general has stopped my character progression and really put a dampener on the entire expansion for me.

I'm all for mythic exclusives, but by the time 7.2 releases all three of these instances will be old news. Introducing them by making them mythic only to begin with (to later on expand to heroic and/or mythic+ (in the case of Karazhan)) is fair, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, we got that after a patch with a 5 boss raid that took place in a single room. Also in the same expansion where the first raid was just a scaled up version of an older raid with minimal changes. It's funny how people forget this.<br />
<br />
Dragon Soul was similar where is came after a 7 boss raid, and DS was an 8 boss raid. Also, 2 out of 3 of the dungeons in the Dragon Soul (as well of Dragon Soul itself) patch took place in pre-existing environments, so less assets had to be made.</div></div><hr />

I sadly ended my FF14 sub (had just got the 480 day rewards), Legion atleast for me there is sooo much to do, I don't have any time for FF14 (I loved tanking on my Dark Knight). I subbed to Netflix, Wow, Crunchyroll and Funimation so I needed to let something go, and FF14 was it.</div></div><hr />

At 855 you should be easy doing normal EN by now. Would prob take less time than Kara. I have not touched Kara and got three clears of EN normal with ilevel 861 at the moment (got lucky with a legendary though, through a emissary cache).</div></div><hr />

I run the hell out of mythics, heroics, LFR etc in hopes for decent upgrades, but i will not run mythic+ on principle because of the system it uses. I never ran a single CM since their release in MoP and while mythic+ uses timers that will probably be the same.</div></div><hr />

Is that principle &quot;being a whiner&quot;? Because they're not nearly as tight as the CM timers are, and even if you fail the timer you still get loot.</div></div><hr />

I left my guild after the first raid night in normal EN... 6 deaths in a row to spew corruption with 0 heals received in the last 10 seconds on my life for each of them.

No he doesn't, as both of his mentioned tiers that introduced more dungeons were final tiers. ToS being the second (out of three) tiers and introducing one dungeon matches the highest amount a non first or last tier has introduced in the past: Trial of the Champion.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I guess it kinda counts. 2 bosses are orcs but all the trash aren't. <br />

Still, WoD dungeons didn't suffer from lack of theme diversity. Even Grimrail and Iron docks have very unique gimmicks to them even tho they're two Iron Horde dungeons.</div></div><hr />

Literally 4 of them had a pretty heavy orc presence. The entire first half of Shadowmoon is orcs, if you're gonna play the &quot;but there was a spider and a worm!&quot;<br />

<br />
Flying does save you time, but it also makes all the activities you do less meaningful. Surge in resources on the Ah means the value of all the &quot;extra&quot; mats you farmed has gone down. <br />
<br />
You just killed some rare mob on some obscure mountain peak with the only path of access being a jump puzzle? Guess what: NOONE FUCKING CARES ANYMORE, it's just another tick on a To-do list because everyone can point their character towards the mob's location and press both mouse buttons...<br />
<br />
Flying brings no value to the game in any way, it creates the perception that you have more time to do relevant things in game, when in fact it just accelerates the rate at which people will go on the forum to complain about having exhausted all relevant content.<br />
<br />
I am saying this here: IF BLIZZARD IS PLANNING TO INTRODUCE FLYING IN THE BROKEN ISLES THEY NEED TO CONSIDER READJUSTING THE RATE AT WHICH WORLD QUESTS SPAWN OR THE NUMBER OF WORLD QUESTS AVAILABLE ON THE MAP AT A GIVEN TIME.<br />

I am accepting the outcome, which is not what I am bringing up here.<br />
There is a difference between decisions from a player to do something which is of minimal or no negative impact on others.<br />

In the meantime, we got Kara and trial of valor, in addition to solo content. You are dillusional if you believe we're getting lackluster content compared to previous expansions.<br />
<br />
Plus the fact that those old patches were often 6-8 months apart. These patches may be smaller, but they're certainly not lackluster, and they're coming every 2-3 months, something Blizzard has been attempting to do for a long time. <br />
<br />
Their old philosophy was to have everything they planned for in patch, and would delay release to make sure everything made it. This time they're releasing content as they finish it, or at least doing so with more frequency, and aren't going to delay if something isn't completely done - it will just come in the next patch.<br />
<br />
I appreciate this new model of content. 3 dungeons might seem like a great number, but people tend to forget that we only had those 3 dungeons and ICC as &quot;relevant content&quot; for 14 months. If we start getting patches every 2-3 months with 1 dungeon (and new raid in some of them) plus solo content, that will easily beat ICC's 14 month reign in terms of amount of content.</div></div><hr />

The were-bear form for guardians looks awesome though!</div></div><hr />

Mage mount is the most meh of the bunch, that's why it had about 0.3 seconds screen time :D</div></div><hr />

Im sure they are. I'm not against them because they are too harsh, i'm against them because of what they are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if people do the dungeon within the time, even if the timer wernt there, you would still be against it?</div></div><hr />

I have a feeling some of the mounts for certain classes will have color variations. Thinking the owl will have tentacles and eyes bursting out the side when playing shadow. Just like DK, green doesn't feel right for frost. Definitely thinking color variations will be coming along.</div></div><hr />

I'm all for people doing the dungeons as fast or as slow as they want. I would just prefer the difficulty be the deciding factor and not how fast you can chain pull the place. <br />
<br />
If you want to be inefficient and BL for every pull on a harder dungeon before you are geared for it when you can run several lower difficulty dungeons in that time then feel free.</div></div><hr />

Glimpse of Sargeras himself then things go down the crapper and we run away back to our planet? Style Halls of Reflection escaping the Lich King? Could be awesome :P<br />
<br />
Void Lords I guess.</div></div><hr />

Sounds to me like you just don't enjoy the challenge they present. Just finishing my first +10, ignoring the timer, gave me more satisfaction than any heroic raid boss this expansion thus far.</div></div><hr />

I'm looking at them as a character progression option. I will never be one of those people who run them just to push the difficulty.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to act like a child and stomp my feet and not come back to the game until they do. Eh who am I fucking kidding, Blizzard only care about the shareholders and not the player base.</div></div><hr />
