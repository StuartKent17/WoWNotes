<br />
Hellfire Citadel Changes<br />
Seems fine really, target audience for Normal will appreciate the changes and the world keeps turning. It's probably a fine line between tweaking numbers so that the mechanics don't feel threatening and then wondering &quot;well, if no one cares about them anyway - why have them&quot;. Difficult problem.<br />
We certainly haven't consistently been successful in doing this, but as we reflect on how Normal difficulty has turned out, we'd rather remove mechanics from Normal difficulty entirely than leave them in but make them so non-threatening that they can be ignored entirely. The latter approach hurts clarity, because you look at an encounter and see 3 or 4 mechanics, but there may actually only be 1 or 2 that you truly need to worry about.<br />
<br />
Removing mechanics from Normal also means that, in effect, going from Normal to Heroic now introduces some additional mechanics, just as going from Heroic to Mythic always has. That adds some additional depth to the experience of learning a boss on a higher difficulty, rather than just having the same encounter with larger numbers. <br />
<br />
It might be better if the difficulty and complexity gap between Normal and Heroic were comparable to the gap between Heroic and Mythic, and that hasn't been the case.<br />
<br />
Who is the target audience for Normal? I thought it was friends and family groups? Has it now changed to pugs with minimal co ordination and no voice comms?<br />
It's been a while now, but when we first elaborated on the Warlords raiding structure last year, we tried to spell out the target audiences. Raiding Azeroth: Part 2 and the associated blogs go into a ton of depth if you have too much time on your hands and want to read thousands of words rambling about raid design. But the most relevant part was this:<br />
<br />
In broad strokes, there are three distinct types of groups that participate in organized raiding:<br />
Friends and Family groups: These are social groups that exist for reasons besides raiding, but whose players would like to venture into raid content together. This type of group is inherently inclusive, and will not organize its roster according to specific class needs, nor is the group likely to criticize or remove players based on performance. Members of this type of group prioritize playing together. Raiding guilds: These are groups that have formed for the purpose of raiding. These are the majority of guilds that you’ll see recruiting in Trade chat or on realm forums. These groups will generally look for specific classes based on roster needs, and will expect a certain level of attendance or performance. Members of this type of group prioritize experiencing and learning the content. Hardcore raiding guilds: An extreme subset of the previous category, these are the guilds of players whose ethos drives them to be the best at games they play, and who are willing to dedicate time and energy to maximize their results. Guilds of this type will recruit and maintain a roster based primarily on performance, and will expect raiders to optimize their characters. Members of this type of group prioritize competition and success. <br />
<br />
I'd say that those three categories largely match with Normal, Heroic, and Mythic raiding respectively. In a lot of ways, many pickup groups trend closer to the Heroic sphere of content, simply because they are selective, and generally will not hesitate to replace someone whose throughput is significantly below par or who is screwing up mechanics. A friends-and-family group will generally not kick out their friend or family member because they stand in the fire a lot. That's sort of the point.<br />

This Month in WoW – October 2015<br />
October is the month of festivals! This year, we’re spending the month celebrating brew, tricky treats, and PvP as we zero in on BlizzCon 2015. Make your October plans now. It’ll be over before you know it!<br />
<br />
In-Game Events<br />
<br />
Brewfest [September 20-October 6]<br />
Brewfest is a time to enjoy the fermented fruits of the harvest: pretzels, cheese, and brew! The competing breweries Thunderbrew, Barleybrew, and the Ogres, all come together outside of all the major cities in a bid to outdo each other with their special ales, meads, and beers. Brave adventurers are invited to sit back, take a pull, and sample the finest wares these brewers have to offer!<br />
<br />
Brewfest is your only chance to acquire the Swift Brewfest Ram and Great Brewfest Kodo mounts, as well as the Wolpertinger and Pint-Sized Pink Pachyderm pets. It’s also your chance to get your brew-covered mitts on a few new items: the Stout Alemental pet, the Steamworks Sausage Grill, and Brewfest Banner toys!<br />
<br />
Darkmoon Faire Returns [October 4-11]<br />
<br />
The wondrous and mystical Darkmoon Faire returns to Azeroth on October 4, and if you haven’t completed all of Silas Darkmoon’s new Darkmoon Races, now’s the time! Test your speed and agility on a variety of racing mounts as you dodge electrifying obstacles and zip all over Darkmoon Island for rewards and achievements. You may also want to take a few moments to be a kid again by going for a ride on the new Darkmoon Seesaw.<br />
<br />
The faire continues to be one of the best ways to acquire heirloom gear, and don’t forget all of the toys, mounts, and pets that can only be gotten here. Bash some gnolls!<br />
<br />
Hallow’s End [October 18 – November 1]<br />
Hallow's End is a celebration of the break between the Forsaken and the Scourge. Many tricks and treats await adventurers seeking holiday fun, including defeating the Headless Horseman, visiting inns and cities for fun items such as masks and costumes, and eating way too much candy in one sitting.<br />
<br />
You’ll find a special Hallow’s End Wickerman set up and ready to burn in Stormwind and near the Undercity in the Ruins of Lordaeron. Every four hours, Genn Greymane and Lady Sylvanas will arrive to light each faction’s respective Wickerman in celebration of Hallow’s End. Of course, it wouldn’t be Hallow’s End without a little mischief.<br />
<br />

Especially the adds on Xhul'horac, they don't actually attack people, they just create fire/void patches, so their only purpose in normal is now as a dps pad. <br />
<br />
Shared Fate is easy to deal with, Kilroggs Heartseeker has an obnoxiously large arrow and if you get hit by that it's your own fault given its so easy to avoid, same with the wailing horrors on Council. Stuff like Kilrogg nerf just breeds the notion that its okay for people to stand in mechanics and Xhul'horac that it's okay to tunnel vision the boss. It doesn't even line up with the blue post. You can't ignore Shared Fate or people die to Hunger for Life or the Wild Pyromaniacs/Void Fiends otherwise explosions go off left right and center.</div></div><hr />

But doesn't mean I have to like the nerfs... After having been as difficult as it was for so long, I don't like how Normal is getting that easy...<br />

I didn't kill Archimonde yet, I hope I will this week so I can easily find groups that now require the curve achievement. I don't really mind doing Heroic or not, I just raid sometimes without caring of my progress I just enjoy raiding and progressing through the raid.</div></div><hr />

There are 4 difficulties, if normal seems to easy for you, work your ass on mythic, and show the filthy casuals how great of a player you are.</div></div><hr />

They have been doing this since the beginning of the xpac as far as I know.. I'm getting loot every 2 weeks on my alts for doing nothing but clicking my mission table.</div></div><hr />

LFR and to some extent normal have been suffering from having an excessive number of mechanics that are there but don't really do anything. It's just distracting and messy, and makes it much harder for new players to learn how to raid by doing LFR, as it's impossible to tell which mechanics are actually important and which mechanics are just watered down versions of things that only matter on heroic/mythic. They should have done this when they introduced flex back in MoP. But better late than never.<br />
<br />
As long as they don't touch heroic, it's all good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bolded part by 1000 not to phased about Normal as that was the old MoP flex mode anyway and if should somewhat easier, as it is basically a leg up for those who want to try raiding but don't want to go into the crap hole that is LFR..<br />
<br />
But so long as they don't touch heroic for the most part but maybe with a slight tweak to Iron Reaver then all will be fine and dandy..</div></div><hr />

<br />
pugs asking for 13/13HC for normal was an issue before and this certainly won't help. If you have an inconsistent or slow progressing guild or simply just PUG your raids all together. The gap to actually get into HCs will be much higher now. Getting geared people with only normal experience into HC is fine just now because they are just the same. Now when mechanics are HC-only I do see the appeal in not inviting people who don't already have the HC experience.</div></div><hr />

I don't really care what kind of arguments people have against it.<br />
Flex was fun with friends on alts and like the Blue post mentioned, not all of your friends are going to be up to par.<br />
If anything, LFR should just go away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably be why they did this too, because as we all know in LFR people will just tunnel the boss since mechanics are non existent, and unfortunately it can be the same issue in normal people just tunnel the boss and not worry about mechanics and end up dying and wiping the raid..</div></div><hr />

What for like the sixth or seventh time? Their plans for raid mode has hardly remained static throughout the whole cycle of each expansion. IMHO they should just not mess with it's structure for one expansion and focus on the content outside of raiding at max level.</div></div><hr />

Removing pretty basic mechanics makes it look more like another easy mode. Not a fan, personally, and I hope this doesn't set a bad precedent that leads to &quot;two easy modes and two hard modes&quot; with no good middle ground. Normal at the moment is almost perfect for players like me that just do pick up groups. Heroic is fun to clear once, but I can't be assed to deal with that difficulty on a weekly basis. Wiping a lot is only fun in a guild where you know that each wipe means better execution next week. Wiping for hours with random people you will never meet again is not rewarding and that's what I get a lot of the time when doing heroic pugs.<br />
<br />
Basically it just feels like normal is being delegitimized by removing basic content from it. Each mechanic adds to the character of the boss, it's why people keep playing the game. LFR is a good example of how a lack of threatening mechanics can lead to every boss feeling the same. I fail to see how things like dodging the axe on Kilrogg is considered too hard for this difficulty. It literally has an arrow and a warning prompt.</div></div><hr />

While it might be jarring for them to do this to it so long after it's release, going FORWARD it does make sense:<br />
<br />
Heroic should be more than Normal with higher damage, health, and DPS requirements. It should add abilities, just like Mythic does.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling newer raids made with this mentality (in Legion) won't feel like they were completely gutted.<br />

As for my raid team: It doesn't matter, we already had pretty much all of the bosses listed here on farm anyway. Just means we clean them up quicker so we can move to our progression ones.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. When I geared my char (started 5weeks ago), I actually got into normal groups without achieve, and having full normal, I got into heroics pretty easy as well, since people care far more if you can handle the mechanics, then ilvl. Atleast here in the EU. Mechanics(as in xp) &gt; ilvl any day.</div></div><hr />

Well, the upgradable rings are pretty much the icc buff, people get stronger every week. 795 rings with procs will add ~50% damage and ~50% damage made during the empowerment.<br />
<br />
And these nerfs change nothing. Archimonde pug groups even on normal already have crazy item level and kill requirements. On hero it is even worse. Yesterday there was a group 720 item level and 5 hero kills to join.</div></div><hr />

Normal could be easier than LFR and you'd still have people requiring AotC and 720 ilvl. LFR is a failsafe against the community treating each other like crap.<br />

And I really don't get how you people still feel threatened by LFR. At this point the rewards are so trivial, the only thing Blizz could do to de-incentivize it more is to have an NPC follow you around constantly ringing a bell and shouting 'SHAME!' if you dare equip an LFR item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you think these nerfs are to do with tuning, you've clearly never done these bosses on anything other than LFR or a really bad pug. These nerfs have nothing to do with tuning. Tuning is damage, amount of debuffs out, amount of/speed of adds etc. Making the adds on Xhul'horac not spawn fire is not a tuning thing, it's the removal of their purpose and a core mechanic in that fight, take away their fire ability and you might as well remove them from the fight all together because they don't attack players or do anything other than spawn fire. <br />
<br />
Kilroggs Heartseeker nerf isn't tuning, its people not moving out of THE MASSIVE FUCKING ARROW. Tuning would be it doing less damage or happening less often. Shared fate is stupidly easy to deal with. If you can't run to the person with the beam connecting you, then raiding isn't for you.<br />
<br />
Same with Wailing Horror, move out of the giant fucking purple void creatures path. <br />
<br />
Adds on Archimonde die so fucking easily its beyond belief. <br />
<br />
It's not like normal is hard now, but LFR is for people who /just/ want to see the content. Leave normal alone, its supposed to be a dry run for heroic, not tourist mode. Stuff like the Xhul'horac nerf and Kilrogg nerf promote tunnel visioning and standing in shit. People on Kilrogg are gonna be shocked when they get to Tyrant and get hurt by her giant obnoxious arrow. <br />
<br />
Seriously, if normal is too hard or too demanding for people, then those people don't actually enjoy raiding in the first place(whether that be the difficulty or the gameplay). Gutting it isn't going to change that and neither are these nerfs, those people still won't enjoy raiding or will still die all the time because they don't care or don't care to bother. They have LFR to see the content if that's all they want. These are people who fundamentally don't enjoy raiding as a concept, which is fine for them, but don't drag casual players who enjoy normal down to their level just to appease people who don't /really/ want to raid in the first place. Because now you're going to create the issue of having a casual group of people (the friends and family group) for whom heroic is of no interest to them but normal is now way too easy. What do they do now? I mean how bad do you think organized casual guilds are exactly that they need this much cotton wool? It's almost insulting to them as players.</div></div><hr />

well you can , if you did it before 30/8/15 , but no one checks achievements and less checks the date , only the kills of that char (oh you did mythic (inspecting armory achievements)? nice , you dont have archimonde normal kill on that char ,so declined)<br />

These complaints piss me off to no end. Here is the deal.

hes right tho there is NO need what so ever to require curve for normal except to be an elitist snob that doesn't want lesser ppl than themselves in and fyi i have circle and curve also i make my own raids for archi normal for the ring upgrade on multiple toons each week and i've yet to require curve for it, i go for circle or if i want ppl to prove they have a clue ill ask for their ring with 2 upgrades minimum for entry.<br />

there shouldn't be a need to be in a guild to kill archi normal, take off your rose tinted glasses this isnt BC anymore where the only way to kill anything is with a guild, those days are gone and people need to adapt to that or GTFO. im sick of people coming out as their only answers to puging problem being get a guild or make your own grp, some ppl may not be good raid leaders and a good one is key to killing things.</div></div><hr />

Um, I JUST explained why. It's their pug, they don't want people without experience. It's very easy to understand. Their pug is not where you go to learn the fight and progress. That's what guilds are for. When people put requirements they want people who have experience on their mains and are doing this crap on alts. If you want to learn the fights join a guild that's what they're for. You can also make your own group and set whatever requirement you want. There are also pugs that don't require achievements (like yours). Bitching about someone wanting people with the same amount of experience so they can have a smooth run is asinine.</div></div><hr />

Kilroggs Heartseeker nerf isn't tuning, its people not moving out of THE MASSIVE FUCKING ARROW. Tuning would be it doing less damage or happening less often. Shared fate is stupidly easy to deal with. If you can't run to the person with the beam connecting you, then raiding isn't for you.<br />
<br />
Same with Wailing Horror, move out of the giant fucking purple void creatures path. <br />
<br />
Adds on Archimonde die so fucking easily its beyond belief. <br />
<br />
It's not like normal is hard now, but LFR is for people who /just/ want to see the content. Leave normal alone, its supposed to be a dry run for heroic, not tourist mode. Stuff like the Xhul'horac nerf and Kilrogg nerf promote tunnel visioning and standing in shit. People on Kilrogg are gonna be shocked when they get to Tyrant and get hurt by her giant obnoxious arrow. <br />
<br />
Seriously, if normal is too hard or too demanding for people, then those people don't actually enjoy raiding in the first place(whether that be the difficulty or the gameplay). Gutting it isn't going to change that and neither are these nerfs, those people still won't enjoy raiding or will still die all the time because they don't care or don't care to bother. They have LFR to see the content if that's all they want. These are people who fundamentally don't enjoy raiding as a concept, which is fine for them, but don't drag casual players who enjoy normal down to their level just to appease people who don't /really/ want to raid in the first place. Because now you're going to create the issue of having a casual group of people (the friends and family group) for whom heroic is of no interest to them but normal is now way too easy. What do they do now? I mean how bad do you think organized casual guilds are exactly that they need this much cotton wool? It's almost insulting to them as players.<br />
<br />
Read what the dev said. They now consider Normal easy mode, that you can do with friends and family who stand in the fire. They don't consider it a dry run for Heroic. You're now in direct contention with the dev's vision for difficulty. Welcome, have a seat, join all of us who hit this wall a while ago, with the rest of the content in the game. <br />
<br />
And, I hate to say it, but this sounds like they're thinking about or planning to do away with LFR, as these nerfs make normal pretty much on par with SoO LFR, but without the auto-group function and personal loot. Typical Blizzard, nerf something into the ground, get rid of it is the only answer. They probably realized last week &quot;Gee, maybe 4 modes for the same content is too much&quot;. You only need 3 - easy, medium, and hard. LFR, Normal, Heroic. Mythic just diluted the content and wasn't needed, but now all the try hards won't feel like they're fulfilled unless it's labeled &quot;mythic&quot;, even if they get rid of that mode and make heroic that hard.<br />
<br />
This dev team has their collective heads so far up their posteriers it's not even funny. They're tweaking this game to it's death.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thunderdragon2</div><div class="date">2015-10-01, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, I JUST explained why. It's their pug, they don't want people without experience. It's very easy to understand. Their pug is not where you go to learn the fight and progress. That's what guilds are for. When people put requirements they want people who have experience on their mains and are doing this crap on alts. If you want to learn the fights join a guild that's what they're for. You can also make your own group and set whatever requirement you want. There are also pugs that don't require achievements (like yours). Bitching about someone wanting people with the same amount of experience so they can have a smooth run is asinine.<br />
<br />
no you didn't a NORMAL kill or 2 is more than enough exp for a NORMAL pug there's NO reason to ask for curve for normal, any1 requiring curve for normal is declaring that they are an incompetent raid leader. ill reiteratrE this and ill caps it also to make it clear YOU DO NOT NEED CURVE TO HAVE EXPERIENCE ON ARCHI NORMAL<br />
<br />
also on the note of raid leader wanting people with same exp to &quot;ensure&quot; as smooth run is nonsense with my archi hc kills all requiring everyone to have curve i have seen many fail simply because people dont have a clue and the raid leader not having a clue/not calling stuff out.<br />
<br />
and for the love of fuck, where in those 2 paragraphs you quoted of mine did i say anything about learning a fight and trying to get their first kill? i mentioned about people that have alredy gotten the kill but still unable to get a second or third or so on because the raid leaders want them to be over qualified for the task at hand.<br />
<br />
shudder, i got a question for you.<br />
<br />
if you make a archi nm pug with curve as a requirement for you grps once every1 that has it is done with hfc how are you going to make your grps.? as there would be no more players with curve that are intrested in hfc anymore</div></div><hr />

Here is the deal. Those groups that ask for those requirements, are people that have guilds on their main, and are looking for other people who also have their main in a guild. They're trying to gear up an alt and want people who are also experienced and on an alt. If you want to progress and get the achievements join a fucking guild or make your own group and set the requirements to whatever the fuck you want.<br />
<br />
Why can't the same be said for the alts?<br />

Oh, that's right - it benefits them. My bad. <br />

<br />
It provides the opportunity for many to see the art and participate in a raid's portion of the xpac's story during that xpac. Not everyone has the time or interest to do the more complete/social difficulty levels. As long as the rewards remain fairly mundane, people that enjoy social raiding will continue to do so regardless of LFR. It's also not a bad place to see the first layer of raid mechanics for those new to raiding.</div></div><hr />

If you don't have the time then play another game. This is a social game. Shouldn't keep anti social shit just because you want to see some art but don't have the time in your life to spend 30 secs talking to someone. God forbid you talk to someone in a fucking mmo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, actually it was advertised as a mode for &quot;Friends and Family&quot; guilds. This change is because it wasn't serving that purpose very well, being too difficult for F&amp;F guilds that don't bench underperforming members.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but that is kind of the point, I believe. To make the modes differentiate. Today HC is a little dull since you often have done the fights a lot on normal before trying HC. Thinking it will be more fun doing HC is probably a good thing?</div></div><hr />

It only is there because it used to be flex, so it now is obsolete. <br />
<br />
It's not more or less difficult than Heroic, both are the exact same difficulty. It's all about the gear you have. If you are highly geared, heroic is easier than normal would be if you were undergeared for it.<br />
<br />
For the friends and family guilds, all you need to do it make better gear available from 5mans or other content. Perhaps make the relevant gear grindable with some weekly caps or whatever so that the content gets easier like that over time and is not instantly faceroll. <br />
<br />
If you've done Normal already, I see absolutely no point in doing heroic. Just equip lower ilvl gear and do normal instead, it's the same exact thing.</div></div><hr />

I talk to people, thank you very much, but I prefer RL friends to talk to. WoW is still a game, and in the past 10 years I have more than my share of guild drama and people like you do nothing to change the toxic community to something better. I am helpful, but I just don't want to &quot;open myself&quot; to people who clearly don't deserve it, because only thing they can is to flame and to abuse others for their fun.<br />
<br />
Hint: If you want to be surrounded by nice, helpful and social people, start to behave accordingly first by yourself. As long as you don't change, you cannot expect others to do the same.</div></div><hr />

Get bent. Lacking time to commit several uninterrupted hours to a raid does not equal anti-social. Very much enjoy the social aspects of WoW, albeit in smaller time blocks of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the time/social side of things, you can find a pug group or make your own any time of the day or night (raid for as long or as little as you want) and choose whether or not to be on voice. I will never understand why people object to being on voice when communication makes fights easier but hey lol now you never have to. Might as well remove lfr at this point too lol.<br />
It's going to be a struggle for these normal mode people going into heroic not knowing how to do mechanics because normal mode no longer has them.</div></div><hr />

If you can't put aside two to three hours then you should either work on your time management skills or go play minecraft.</div></div><hr />

All servers are dying, major mythic raiding guilds are dying (mine being one of them) the only ones still full of active members are the casual players that jump over their water fountain in the garrison for hours on end as no one does it in stormwind any more. Frankly, whats the point, how does this actually help guilds that wish to suceed in end game content (i mean mythic), well I can answer that, it doesn't. Boosting ppls ilvl by easier content does not make them capable of handling mechanics, if they could not handle normal (old flex in mop) then they are gonna be pretty terrible at heroic and even considering them for mythic content is nonsensical. So what were left with is higher ilvl guys that bypass mechanics and treat everything as a turn up and press a button mentality. On the whole moving forward, this concept of breaking down one raid into 4 stages of diffculty to fill out game time is ludicrous and I for one will spit in the eye of any man that wishes to run dumber, dumb, normal, maybes pecial modes. None of this is rewarding.</div></div><hr />
