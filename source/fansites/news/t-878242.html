The Patch 4.1 Public Test Realm Notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/160430/patch-41-public-test-realm-notes-march-30) have been updated once again and contain a lot of interesting changes! <br />

A couple of classes changes from the past 2 PTR builds<br />
A lot of 5-man dungeons changes<br />
The rate at which Honor Points are earned has been doubled.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Achievements Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
The guild achievements for earning exalted reputation with factions (Ambassador, Diplomacy, and United Nations) have been fixed to now correctly count cumulative guild members with exalted factions. Previously, these achievements would only count exalted factions on one guild member.<br />
The guild rated Battleground title achievements should now properly be awarded.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
Account Bound Items<br />
<br />
Many &quot;Account Bound&quot; heirlooms are now labeled as &quot;Battle.net Account Bound&quot;, meaning that they can also be traded or mailed to characters that are on different World of Warcraft accounts under the same Battle.net account.<br />
Mail sent to characters on the same Battle.net account now arrives instantaneously, as it does for the same World of Warcraft account.<br />
Mailing account-bound items to characters of the opposite faction on the same Battle.net account will now correctly translate faction-specific items to their appropriate equivalent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Blackrock Caverns<br />
<br />
Aura of Arcane Haste now has a clearer visual on the bearer of the aura.<br />
Bound Flames in the Karsh Steelbender encounter no longer create Lava Pools when they are killed.<br />
The Short Throw ability used by Twilight Sadists has had its range reduced to 10 yards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Deadmines<br />
<br />
Ragezone cast by Defias Blood Wizards now only increases damage dealt, no longer increasing damage taken.<br />
<br />
<br />
Grim Batol<br />
<br />
Bleeding Wound damge from General Umbriss has been lowered by 20%.<br />
Malignant Trogg now moves more slowly.<br />

<br />
The maze section has been removed, and nearby creatures and bosses have been adjusted to compensate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guilds<br />
<br />
Guild Challenges are now available for testing.<br />
<br />
These challenges can be found in the Info pane of the guild UI.<br />
Guild Challenges fall into three categories: Guild Dungeon Run, Guild Raid, and Guild Rated Battleground.<br />
Each challenge can be completed a set number of times per week. Guild groups participating in level-appropriate Heroic or normal difficulty dungeons and raids, or Rated Battlegrounds, will automatically qualify for challenge credit.<br />
Each time a Guild Challenge is completed, the guild will be awarded experience and gold deposited directly into the Guild Vault, as well as the opportunity to earn all-new achievements. A popup or “toast” will be displayed to confirm a Guild Challenge has been completed (similar to achievement alerts).<br />
Guild experience earned via Guild Challenges will be awarded above the daily cap. The experience cap will move forward relative to the amount of experience obtained through completing Guild Challenges (similar to rested experience for characters).<br />
Guilds already at the level cap will be awarded substantially more gold in place of guild experience.<br />
Gold rewards require the qualified guild members of the group to be honored with their guild, and the guild must be level 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Alchemy<br />
<br />

<br />
So let's bash them whilst they're down, eh GC World of Warcraft Development Team? :)<br />
<br />
I fixed that for you. Daelo is the lead dungeon developer anyway, and there are several people above him and GC.<br />
<br />
The nerfs hardly affect people who no problems with heroics anyway. If you're in raid gear, heroics are a complete joke right now where you can pull two packs and your raiders know to throw out ccs on the mobs in the back, I pop tanking CDs and away we go.<br />
<br />
The people who are struggling will have less problems. The challenge in heroics will be from ZA and ZG for the casual players now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if the &quot;Bound to Battle.net Account&quot; means you'll be able to transfer between servers, or just between different toons on different accounts on the same server.</div></div><hr />

If they are going to let players transfer them across their WoW accounts, why can't they let us transfer them across servers? If this isn't allowed with the patch, Blizzard may want to think more about adding it. More people have BoAs on another server than they have a 2nd WoW account, I'd assume, so mailing them cross server seems like the better idea...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now it's going to be hard to tell the actually good players, from the bad players<br />
<br />
No, it really won't. The bad players will still stand in fire, it just won't always kill them. The bad players will still not know how to use their cooldowns or properly manage debuffs.<br />
<br />
There are tricks and special things you can do in every heroic that most will not notice, but astute individuals will see.</div></div><hr />

UA is a smaller damage buff or protection for affliction, not anywhere near the reliance that destruction has an immolate.<br />
Doubling of Honor I am not convinced is needed. There are already persistent issues with non-participation, afkers, and general screwing around because they know they can get a reward out of doing very little. This will only make it worse.<br />
Before any doubling of a reward then it should be ensured you have earned it.</div></div><hr />

Surely that is a feature that goes without saying. If you have more than one wow account under a battle.net account and your characters aren't on the same server, you're screwed if you can't mail cross realm.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adrim</div><div class="date">2011-03-31, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, of course this doesn't mean cross-realm people, be real.<br />
<br />
Think for a second, what mechanism would you even use to mail something cross-realm?<br />
<br />
Answer: You can't because there isn't one. Name-Realm doesn't work (...yet).<br />
<br />
This is for people like myself who filled up all 10 slots on their primary server but still wanted to have more toons so they got a second account (and used the refer-a-friend bonus to level their toons on the same server). My highest toon on my second account is a DPS so farming JPs is not nearly as easy as my first account with my tank. Now I don't have to shudder at the idea of repurchasing everything I already have and no longer need since most of the toons on my first account are at max level.<br />
<br />
So, no, don't get too excited, it's not cross-realm...but clearly this is a major improvement (especially the instant mail which will finally let me have some banking toons without suffering 1hr delays when I need mats from them). Someday they'll figure out a way to do cross realm.<br />
<br />
I actually think it's more likely they'll find a different solution tho, akin to the tabard vendor, where all your toons on all realms will be able to go and get account bound items reissued. That seems a much more achievable solution than the perils of cross-realm mail (think spam potential) and all of the addressing headaches (how do you spell Auchindoun again?)</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't take anything for granted with blizzard and their ability to make things more convoluted than they need to be. In fact, it sounds exactly like them to make it so that you can mail between accounts but not cross server, which is only lent more credence from the fact that it does not specifically say that cross server mail will happen.</div></div><hr />

Here's what has me wondering, though... Blizzard is either going back on their word (i.e. Wrath was too easy, TBC was too hard, Cata is a mix of the two and will be just right) or there was a TON of people who unsubbed or threatened to unsubb which is causing these nerfs, much more than what the QQers on the forums would indicate...</div></div><hr />

cant they just make it so your battlenet account has info on what heirlooms u have and you get them when you make a new toon on a new server?<br />

but then you might ask and how will it know what heirlooms to send.. well im sure wouldn't be hard to add a lil page to battlenet account page that has a list of what heirlooms you have. and you can tick a box beside them so it knows what ones u want sent every time you make a new alt on a different server,,<br />

They decided to introduce a new bug(opps I mean &quot;fix&quot;) that causes you to aggro the next group, and wipe the dungeon. I mean, seriously, what idiot wants to switch targets if the current one dies mid steady shot? All that does is invite &quot;stop pulling hunter&quot; /kick!<br />

Ya. bring back the casual player who believes they deserve everything that everyone does even though they don't know the fights or put in the time.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZeroEdgeir</div><div class="date">2011-03-31, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, for people not quite grasping things with the change to Heirlooms:<br />
<br />
If you have more than 1 WoW account on your Battle.net account, WITH CHARACTERS ON THE SAME SERVER, you can mail heirlooms between them.<br />
<br />
THIS IS NOT CROSS-SERVER MAILING<br />
<br />
Cross-server mailing is a massive change in a technological manner, not in a simple &quot;Oh, they can just change that little bit...&quot;. Look at how quickly the announced (at Blizzcon 2009) region-wide Battlegroups for PvP went. We got to Stage 1 of it, and it's stopped dead nearly after that (A few battlegroups got linked here and there, that is it). When it comes to inter-server communication, it is not a lightweight or easy task as you assume it is.<br />
<br />
I do think that the best solution for the heirlooms is to attach them to your Battle.net account, and give you an option to manage them from the account page. From there, you pick the heirloom(s) you have, and which toon to send them to, much like the RAF mount system works.<br />
<br />
<br />
To everyone bitching about the heroics being nerfed: Does it directly impact your gaming that others get to enjoy the content? No, so really, just drop it. If I wanted to bitch about dungeon difficulty, I'd reference Lower Blackrock Spire and Scholomance, pre-1.8 nerfs (I think it was around then anyways... been a few years), where you had 5 people, and more trash than some heroics have now, located in 2 rooms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not about thinking, it's about the fact that none of the early dungeons, and even the later dungeons that were long were broken up into pieces. But what about WC? WC was too god damn long. I think even some other lower dungeons need to be broken up as well.<br />
<br />
Like heroics, I do not want to spend 45-90 minutes in a dungeon. I want 15-45 minute dungeons tops. Maybe this is pretty easy in 345 gear with people who aren't stupid pubbies, but for the most part, people are stupid pubbies and these instances aren't fun.<br />

This isn't about CASUALCRAFT like most of the people here (raiders) will post about. This is about taking the tedium out of an expansion that's so wrought with tedious activities that it simply isn't fun anymore.</div></div><hr />

so fucking sad. so many quit during cataclysm. hopefully one day blizzard realizes, what made wow so popular once :(<br />
<br />
Blizzard won't see this as an error infact they went up another million subs over the past 6 months, and they have admitted they are making the game for the noob in mind.<br />
<br />
And I find it funny that every time GC gets up and makes a post like better gear will nerf the content over time, and once again when he speaks up of no nerfs coming, bam nerfs come again. I wouldn't be surprised to see GC quit the team.</div></div><hr />

15min heroics sounds like you should be playing FPS games like CoD rather then MMO's that are a game genre that revolves around people spending time with their character, but i can agree with 90-120min heroics being a tad long, but not for an undergeared group, then 90mins is just fine...<br />

hehe yeah, i find his timing of &quot;no, we're not nerfing heroics anymore&quot; posts quiet funny tbh, always posted the week we see bunch of hotfix nerfs, or changes on PTR's to heroics... it seems like he's not in on the loop with the rest of the dev team anymore, poor crabby :ppp</div></div><hr />

I'm a tank, I don't give a shit about dmg if I can hold threat. I don't have threat problems ATM, and in some dungeons I can already pull as much / more dmg as some dps'ers...This will just make people QQ about Ferals again &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

Hey there. Personally I think your view of the game is very skewed. I'm friendly, play in a 10man guild with friends, and I'm half way through hard modes. I raid between 4-8 hours a week, for real. People who act elitist and arrogant bother us, too. When I started playing the game in Vanilla, most people were friendly, but like the rest of the internet, there were tons of assholes. I don't like playing with assholes in any game.</div></div><hr />

Some of the changes I admit were needed, like High Priestess Azil's Seismic Shard now has a more obvious warning visual. But a lot of the other changes that make the fights more forgiving for making mistakes simply aren't needed. Heroics need to be unforgiving. As I always say, you learn more from dieing than living when playing WoW. <br />
<br />
Plus it's not as if heroics are hard anyways, once you get all the gear from them you can burn through most heroics in under 30 minutes.</div></div><hr />

All hardcore player farm hcs they don't need nothing anymore and have 2 tiers more then the badplayer with 346 gear so even if they make hcs a joke for hardcore what is the problem? Its better for us because we will farm our daily even faster and casuals don't wast so much time in hcs and don't get so annoying. Give them a chance to explore the game.

Yeah.. I am never one to complain about dungeon difficulties either way.. but we are about to have everyone bumped to 353 gear.. and these nerfs are pretty significant.

HCs are never meant to be end game PvE you suppose to gear up your character to start doing raids there is no point to stay on HCs even if you don't like raiding you will eventually get sick of doing HCs only so i really don't get it why people are whining about.<br />
<br />
If you raiding you shouldn't care<br />
If you raiding and you have an alt you should welcome this change.<br />
If you don't raid and you are doing HCs only well your life is gonna get easier.<br />

<br />
They are yet again nerfing content...why? I mean, if it ain't broken, why fix it?<br />
Boosting AoE abilities to WotLK'ly amount... why? did they REALLY think at some point that we want to just AoE our way through everything? atleast i don't<br />
Setting 6sec internal CD to shaman Cleansing waters...why? is that really the problem why shamans are so good at the arenas?<br />
Removing the &quot;maze&quot; section of WC...wait..what? was that REALLY ever a maze?<br />
UA Boost *coolface.... I'll leave it to that.<br />
Boosting Ice Lance interraction during FoF... ummm...yeah that is something that really needs boosting!<br />
<br />
got a bit carried away there, sorry about that.... well i guess we'll see what they are really upto when the 4.1 actually comes live.<br />
<br />
Still have faith(yeah i went there) in blizzard though... they did good with cataclysm... hopefully they won't ruin it too badly.<br />
<br />
One more thing ;) What do you fellow players think about those &quot;free&quot; epics that are on their way again, don't you think the value and that sort of a &quot;respect(maybe)&quot; is once again going byebye with those, once again the only thing revealing something is item level...I mean, why would u even sort the rarity of gear if there's nothing rare about it?`<br />

<br />
Is content really that hard lol? Most guilds are 12/12 on lightbringer 27 guilds in fact. I dont get why people have to be elitest to be able to understand priority rotations instead of set faceroll rotations. Or raid bosses that are actually fun and even funner heroic, they arent that hard just pay attention to whats going on around you and listen to the RL.<br />
<br />
So elitest nerds are people that take mayne 5-10min to read up on their class and can actually put up good numbers while not standing in fire. Odd that people ridicule others for doing well.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thats exactly what went wrong with Cata, Blizz listened to you elitist nerds who have no life no clue how other feel nor do you even care what other players are going through. As long as your lifeless nerdy ass can get on WOW and act like you are better than everyone else, YOU ARE ONE OF THE &quot;GOOD PLAYERS&quot; you couldn't careless about the community or what others are going through.<br />
<br />
Its people like you who killed the game for me, when I started everyone was super friendly and always offered to help it was never about Skill never about gear for me it was about making friends and grouping up and doing things as a group, and now its full of players like you who just play to separate yourself from the &quot;BAD PLAYERS&quot; and be elitist A holes in the game.<br />
<br />
The sad thing is Cata forced me to become a player like you, I had to play at my very best and forced me to only group with top players to get things done, get things Killed, I hated what I've become so I quit the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
You realize most raiding guilds with decent progression log on to raids and maybe a daily if they want the VP boots for a alt or gold then log off right? While casuals and bad's are on alot more trying to get some of the earliest bosses down while wiping then complaining the content is too hard. <br />
<br />
You were forced to be a good player. That's horrible. Then you couldnt faceroll Icc with your baddie friends so you grouped with better players who play better to get more progression. What is wrong with that? You didnt have to group with better players, you could've stayed with your friends.</div></div><hr />

It appears people have absolutely no idea how insanely HUGE this change is if they spent their time whining over a minor buff to frostmages, then that leads me to believe you dont care that much for arena after all. <br />

For those who do care about this change. This will be absolutely amazing for the game. No more queue dodging, sitting on ur rank for gladiator whole season.. Just wow. Gonna be epic. Wonder if they will make region or still keep pvp titles to their respective BG's?</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you, I have alts and I'd like to have meaningful gameplay for them aswell, not a pathetic faceroll that this is obviously coming into. The game isn't only in the raids and there are also people who most likely never will raid due to other reasons than suckage and this is just a cold harsh slap into their face aswell. Two slightly harder Zandalari dungeons are a poor compensation and more like a joke in comparisation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just re-read the patchnotes. There is a lot of mentioning that visual affects are improved for clarity. The elementals not spawning lava pools..well, that is a big change...however already in our first raidweek while still gearing up, we could get the boss to 10 stack and then reset him and basically kill him before any elemental had a chance to create as pool.<br />
<br />
So..all told..think you are exagerating if these changes make for a &quot;pathetic faceroll&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It's just one big slippery slope. Nefing content for the sake of bad players breeds more bad players.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter to me that much to be honest, but seeing as some fights were nerfed to the ground (Karsh, Umbris) I am confused as to what the Developers really want to do with this game. I have nothing against making some mechanics more noticeable but nerfing or removing a major part of the fight is kinda against what was said few weeks back &quot;We're happy with the difficulty level of heroics, it's okay with Random group buff&quot;. Clearly when T12 or T13 hits, if we will ever need to do heroics again for Valor points, they will be as easy as they were in Wotlk during T10 / T11 times. IMO instead of making heroics easier they could make them a bit shorter.<br />
On the other hand, I'm happy with the Honor and BoA changes. I like to PvP occasionaly, but I'm not keen on habing to farm honor in order to do so, this makes it much less time consuming.<br />
Other than that, I'm not really impressed with these patch notes.</div></div><hr />

However I can't help but wonder for new players what is this teaching them? Making things so easy with 15% bonus from luck of the draw any hard mechanics ah nps mate just ignore them their pointless anyway. I mean I out gear these heroics so bad now it's not even funny it's chain pull nuke nuke done like in wrath doesn't mater if the tank doesn't keep agro I could heal through it so even without the buff and the nerfs we've had to them since cata went live it would still be a face roll.<br />

Some of you have been playing game for years,some of you decades at this point and making a boss retardedly difficult turns off people that have yet to play or do not play often.This is why I wish blizzard would implement a difficulty setting like DDO has and not the current kinda hard/harder/jesus why are my thumbs melting difficulty curve they tried to haphazardly implement this expansion.<br />

I have alts. But I am VERY bored in HC right now. Spam only one button? Why? I want to enjoy this game from diferent perspective. It has to be hard. We are small guild and I cant take my alt to raid. Should I play with him in nosence HC? Without focus, without anything? <br />
<br />
If we have low geared teammate i want test them in dungeon. If he is avoiding fire, if he is doing what he has to do etc. But in this? If he is a healer he put follow on me thats all.<br />

Meh, I kind of like it, but I don't think there are that many people having more then 10 high level chars on one server who will take advantage of this to supply their alt account with hierlooms. I used to have this, until I closed my main account, and it would have been handy to have all my heirlooms moved from the main account to the second account, but now it's too late. My new account has all alts on another server, so this change won't matter at all.<br />

<br />
On more serious note, there are also people that do enjoy some minor challenge even when doing boring and tedium tasks to cap their vp instead of falling asleep and going braindead especially from a dps pov...mostly because that makes those tasks...more boring and tedium? I mean simple stuff like the ragezones, you are dps stand in it to own the recounts, you tank and not amazingly geared, move from it asap else you risk getting gibbed, now you very simply can ignore it?

This, good god this. I have alts I want to gear up, but don't have patients to deal with 1-2hour runs because a tiny handful of people demand the games difficulty be set to iron man challenge so they can horde everything for themselves. I have more important things to do with my time then play tag with a mob and keep it locked down since the tank is taking harder his than a clothy. The only good thing about Wrath was I could get a heroic done in 5 minutes, get the points and LEAVE. If dungeons were so boring I really wouldn't mind them being long grinds like they currently are, but after 15minutes I would rather be sleeping. :|</div></div><hr />

As long as your lifeless nerdy ass can get on WOW and act like you are better than everyone else, YOU ARE ONE OF THE &quot;GOOD PLAYERS&quot; you couldn't careless about the community or what others are going through.<br />
<br />
Its people like you who killed the game for me, when I started everyone was super friendly and always offered to help it was never about Skill never about gear for me it was about making friends and grouping up and doing things as a group, and now its full of players like you who just play to separate yourself from the &quot;BAD PLAYERS&quot; and be elitist A holes in the game.<br />
<br />
The sad thing is Cata forced me to become a player like you, I had to play at my very best and forced me to only group with top players to get things done, get things Killed, I hated what I've become so I quit the game.<br />
<br />
Oh shut up. Blizzard didn't make anything, from 5 mans to normal raids, hard at all. For every fight in Cata, you just had to learn to actually move a bit, and to know two or three basic fight mechanics. And you could be decked in epics in a matter of weeks. It forced you to actually think a bit and be good at something, before you are rewarded, and you hated yourself because of that? Yeah...good for you.<br />
<br />
And, when did you even start? Because the nicest communities were actually in Vanilla WoW. And whoever played during that time can remember the amount of wipefests, in basically every instance from Deadmines to Strat, and later UBRS, without any heroic mods or such. Not to mention the raids.<br />
Everything seemed hard, and in retrospective we will always look at it as the hardest part of WoW, not because it actually was, mechanic wise, but because the game itself was new and fresh. And the majority of the players, including myself, were actually pretty noobish compared to today's standards. <br />
Mostly because the game wasn't so widespread and it didn't have almost any ground breaking addons. Deadly Boss Mods didn't exist, you had to learn the tactics by pure experience, no matter how simple they were most of the time. Quest Helper wasn't there, you had to read the quests to actually know what to do. Wowhead and similar sites basically didn't exist. You couldn't just copy someone's talents by inspecting them or checking their armory. I could go on and on... <br />
What I'm trying to say is, you had to learn all that stuff by yourself, or immerse in the community, and be nice and polite, because there was no battlegroups, no paid name changes, nothing. It was your realm, and you basically knew 90% of the people that were playing on it. So you actually cared about your reputation, with the guild and with the other people from the realm. You cared about the gear, because it was hard to attain. <br />
<br />
Later on, as the game evolved, and everything became more accessible to everyone, the communities fell apart. Blizzard caved in to those players who just didn't want to think much/at all while playing, because there is some serious money with that demographic, and the zergfest began. It started slowly with TBC, but it all come down with WotLK.<br />
<br />
Old players mostly hated the changes, and while majority of them were quitting the game, even more of these new breed of players were flooding the realms. They never had to respect the people they group with because of the dungeon finder, they didn't have to learn to respect the gear because they were flooded with epics from the start, and were pugging raids from day one. People just had click and loot, and feel powerful. Everyone became distant, and no one really cared anymore. <br />
And that's how you get communities filled with jerks. With easy games. Not the other way around. <br />
We aren't killing the game, people like you are.</div></div><hr />

I rarely pug, but if the pug experience is so bad that our groups are deemed nice and good, even on the hight of our friendly griefing of each other, then all I can say is, nerf those heroics. For the real good players it won't make a difference, they steamroll those heroics for months now. For the bad players, casual players, whatever, those who pug, it will hopefully make the random heroic feature a bit more enjoyable. (it's not because players are bad that they shouldn't be allowed some fun in this game. The game is more than just being able to heal through packs without CC and knowing when to interrupt or kite Encumbered. Bads aren't ruining anything: if you truly are good, those heroics shouldn't have posed a threat to you since 2 weeks after you dinged.)<br />
<br />
And as to the interrupt change: that only took them 6 years to change! Finally. A change obviously in the light of 10mans.</div></div><hr />

It would just be cross realm mail on your own battle.net account. You would get a list with characters on all your battle.net accounts on all realms and select the recipient. Done. Come on, 4.1 is going to be a major patch so they can add some ui for this.</div></div><hr />

The sad thing is that Blizzard noticed how players like you killed the expansion that should be the greatest of all (the one with the most important vilan in warcraft) and they decided to fix the game. But the damage was done and they can't fix it since it will angry their avid moneylovers from Activision.<br />
<br />
Those ppl don't care if the game lost subs because it was too easy and lost its appeal or too hard. The only thing that they don't know is that the game itself is dying by aging alread not because it was too easy or too hard.

<br />
<br />
Oh please. They pretty much said Heroics were gonna start out hard then become faceroll over time Before the expansion even launched.<br />
<br />
Sorry you can't pay attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Encounters nerf themselves over time&quot;<br />
<br />
If that means that they had all the nerfs alread in the game and they trigger by themselves as the build number increases, then yes.<br />
<br />
Since it's hard to believe that, then no, it's a indicator of the devs atitude towards QQ and shooting everywhere trying to increase an alread dying player base by game aging.<br />
<br />
A good chunk of good players left during the WotLK, and I'm not talking about hardcore players or whatever, just that, good players. Be it hardcore ones, casual ones, etc. Good players.<br />
<br />
Most of the player base nowadays is composed of bad players/really bad players, it happens with every game and WoW had a good run time before it happened. But sure, WotLK just pushed WoW way fast to it and it's something that can't be changed anymore. Some good players came back with the changes from WotLK to Cataclysm, but that's it. No more superb subscription numbers and increases, just player base decline over time.<br />
<br />
So we get to the point we are now, they're trying to go towards a WotLK approach again, altough not that hard like it was in WotLK (but it's getting closer and closer) to see if they can recover players, but it's probably going to work the other way around, since the good players who left because WotLK design and came back because of Cataclysm design will problably leave again (as some alread did thanks to Rift+WoW QQ) when noticing this trend. Bad players never cared about these problems, just what's the new purple in the mail for them to get when they login.<br />

Am i the only one that liked the model of wrath? I like complex encounters, just not ones that 1 person screwing up will kill us all. Also i do not like 1h heroics. I was quite content with a 15min heroic. Sure being able to clear it in 15 mins isn't very heroic? but i had a blast. Now i might trying PvE content again with these changes.....<br />
<br />
Basically, you want a single-player game in a multi-player game.<br />
<br />
If you're grouping with ppl and don't like that someone doing something wrong, screws the team, then... you're playing the wrong game.<br />
<br />
If you can't accept anything going wrong that makes your heroic take a little bit longer, then, wrong game again, because they only get to 1h when things go terrible wrong, since the begining. Most of the time, they take 1h because ppl goes afk everytime (and most of the time for the lack of focus, they go to their facebook, msn, etc. and leave ppl there waiting), leaves the party, etc.<br />
<br />
Sorry bro, but the only place where you can get a complex encounter where nobody will screw you is in a single-player game. &quot;Forever Alone&quot;.<br />

As a mediocre player (5/12hm), i couldn't care less about heroic nerfs.<br />
<br />
Farmed them when Cata started, don't need them anymore since i can cap valor raiding. I can gear my alts faster.<br />
<br />
Anybody caring about heroic nerfs is stuck at omnitron and doing only BH probably. Anyone raiding regularly stopped caring about heroics after they got the gear from them.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I care about the game itself, even if I'm not at Omnitron since the launch, lol.<br />
<br />
What I care about the game is &quot;Encounters nerf themselves over time&quot; and Blizzard not following their own set guide lines later.<br />

All I can say to the people whining about the heroic changes is:<br />
<br />
Why does it matter?<br />
<br />
They were a challenege to YOU and ME in January. Now we are ain ilv 359-370 gear and doing hardmodes. Meaning you probably don't even do heroics. So it is content that is outdated. We have moved on. It doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Or do you also cry that a DK could Solo Yogg Saron now while you had to bring 9 buddies?<br />
<br />
Ah well...I am aware that complaints like this will never end...<br />
<br />
Because a 85 DK soloing a 3.1 lolololol10man normal mode in 85 gear is the same thing... oh wait! It's not! Terrible comparision, my friend... terrible...<br />
<br />
You don't care, I get it, but it does matter...<br />
<br />
again &quot;Encounters nerf themselves over time&quot;. What you're going to say to these players that need nerfs so hard when they reach the new heroics and raids (that we alread got nerfs thanks to pushing baddies to raiding without learning the basics in 5mans)? You're going to say &quot;i'm on cho'gall, I don't care about council&quot;? LOL bro... lol.<br />

If you've been and done the heroics, why do you care if they're nerfed? Probably you've done them twenty odd times each. If you're still doing them it means you're farming, and if you're just farming it's best to farm quickly.<br />
<br />
Wich you do alread if you're really done with it. Players who are done with it don't need nerfs to do them fast. Sorry.<br />

I don't know about you, I have alts and I'd like to have meaningful gameplay for them aswell, not a pathetic faceroll that this is obviously coming into. The game isn't only in the raids and there are also people who most likely never will raid due to other reasons than suckage and this is just a cold harsh slap into their face aswell. Two slightly harder Zandalari dungeons are a poor compensation and more like a joke in comparisation.<br />
<br />
Exactly. I bet ppl who say they want facerolling their alts alread even without a new tier out, just had a hell of problem with their mains and actually wanted to those changes from day one. So now they celebrate that they don't need to learn their alts mechanics, so they can faceroll and still get &quot;rewards&quot;, lol.<br />

And you really thing that it will decrease your time? Increasing the number of baddies will just increase your time. You want 10 minutes run with ppl who can't do it and just make them go worse for the next batch of instances... gratz.<br />

This, good god this. I have alts I want to gear up, but don't have patients to deal with 1-2hour runs because a tiny handful of people demand the games difficulty be set to iron man challenge so they can horde everything for themselves. I have more important things to do with my time then play tag with a mob and keep it locked down since the tank is taking harder his than a clothy. The only good thing about Wrath was I could get a heroic done in 5 minutes, get the points and LEAVE. If dungeons were so boring I really wouldn't mind them being long grinds like they currently are, but after 15minutes I would rather be sleeping. :|<br />
<br />
easier = more bad players, more &quot;1-2 hour runs&quot;, gratz.<br />

It's so &quot;tiny handful of people&quot; that they changed the entire game design from WotLK to Cataclysm... something is wrong with your assumptions... if it was like that, they wouldn't even bother changing the game to start with it...</div></div><hr />

Probably not. Would love that myself - but cant see it happening. The problem is that of addressing...... They would need to change the whole mail system to support addressing in the format of realm-character. Im guessing this would be a very large change to some important systems. My guess then is we arent going to see this anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the same patch where we get ZA and ZG, the next tier of heroics! People who stomp on the current heroics get something challenging, and the those who couldn't do anything before get to finish them. This cycle will repeat itself for the next tier of heroics, and the tier after that, just like it does for raids.<br />
<br />
If you find these older heroics too easy, good for you, but that only means you want to be focusing on the next tier, not wallowing in nostalgia and feelings of superiority. If there's anything to complain about, it should be that ZA and ZG might be too easy.<br />

Honestly, end-game Cata is a snoozefest. There's nothing really engaging about any of the raids or instances. BWD pales in comparison beside Kara in feel and look. Hell, Naxx was more entertaining the first five times I ran it. I was excited to do Ulduar or Gruul's or Malygos. Cata's heroics and raids put me to sleep. I can barely get through an at-level normal Throne of the Tides without wanting to alt-f4 and go play a lower-level alt. Sure, the heroics were an engaging challenge at 333. Now I'm grumbling WHEN people CC, not when they don't or intentionally break it.<br />
<br />
I've seen the encounters. I've heard &quot;BREAK YOURSELVES UPON MY BODY&quot; enough times to make me question my sexuality. I know what happens where and when and I know that poor Ripsnarl killed his family. I don't need to drag myself through all of that again, with all the tedium, all the fine excruciating detail. Tonight I'm throwing shadowbolts, tomorrow I'm backstabbing. Where I'm standing and what I'm doing in relation to the encounter doesn't change that Drahga Shadowburner sounds like a more constipated English-dubbed Frieza or that Halls of Origination is like six bosses too long and no matter what class/spec I'm playing the bosses skipped will always drop something I need. The less tedious the old shit is, the more likely I'm going to keep playing to see the new shit. Raids can be hard. New tiers of heroics can be hard. But I don't want to slag through tired old shit endlessly so I can slag through obnoxious new shit endlessly until the obnoxious new shit becomes the next tier of tired old shit.</div></div><hr />

Know what this is going to bring on? It's going to bring on more bad players getting easy gear in heroics and then getting their asses stomped into the grounds by raid bosses. Because they're not learning from hard encounters where they should be they're going to go into raids even less prepared than they already are. And now that heroics are less of a barrier it's going to come to where the entitled casual whining asshats are going to start QQ'ing for raids being nerfed as well. And Blizzard, of course, in their spineless inability to just say &quot;NO&quot;, because they're afraid the asshats will cry and ragequit to Rift or Old Republic, will cave and give it to them. Then we'll be right back where we were in Wrath. Bad content.<br />

Might be that you're right, and Blizzard will give you exactly what you want.

I went doing research, and at least on my realm I could find a few guilds that have gone 12/12 on normal...But not very many. Not very many at all.<br />
<br />
I could find just a couple that have gone 5/12 on HM's...like 2?<br />
<br />
Okay so I take it you people are in these guilds. And apparently you are so focused on your little world that you now believe the rest of your respective realms are just as progressed as you? Oh and none of you are elitist....you are all casual. This crap is just that easy. <br />
<br />
Let's face it. In reality any of you that are this progressed has poured an insane amount of time into the game. I am absolutely sure you are great players. You probably need to get out more, but that's your decision in life and you are welcome to it. I'm glad you enjoy the game that much.<br />
<br />
And it comes down to this - when things get nerfed like this you feel like the other 80% of players are just getting unemployment. Here you worked your butt off to get these things, and all these other's that couldnt do it when you could are now gonna get the same thing you worked your butt off for. And this pisses you off. But here's the flaw in your QQ'ing - if blizzard only catered to you, most of this content wouldnt even happen to begin with. Cause quite honestly, just you 20% of great players alone are not worth it moneywise to make things for. So yes, those other 80% of players that don't invest the time you do also need to be catered to. That means making the content available to you hardcore initially, let you get stuff before everyone else. This makes you happy. After a while, make it easier and let the other players experience the content too. This makes them happy. Will you whine? Probably will still. But you'll still be here next month, and now the others will as well.<br />
<br />
Just fyi - my guild has probably 5 raid groups running. I don't think any of them have downed more than 6 or 7 bosses. The people are pretty well geared and most of the time do good at staying out of crap, but we also don't boot people that don't. We are laid back and just take our time learning it. I expect most guild are like this, and your 12/12 and 5/12 HM guilds are very much more in the minority. You can claim all you want, but the numbers are simply not there to back you up to the idea that your guilds are the norm. You are elitists. That isn't a bad things necessarily, but just accept it and move on.</div></div><hr />

Holy cow - heroics are faceroll already - we already overgeared heroics.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adyssa</div><div class="date">2011-03-31, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And what is reasoning behind allowing Hunter to automatically gain another target if he is casting a shot (instead of canceling shot)? But this change doesnt apply to... for example, dunno... any damn other ranged who are casting and have like 5x less instant casts to use?... Just ridiculous babysitting for hunters...<br />
<br />
This is the second person I've seen say this... This is not a fix or an addition, this is how hunters work in game currently. It, however, is NOT a good thing. All our shots automatically acquire a target if pressed and casted shots sometimes just switch and fire at a new target if your target dies midcast. It's one of several reasons hunters accidentally pull the next group and/or break CC. You DO NOT WANT this functionality. It is horrible. Horrible horrible horrible.<br />
<br />
How can anyone see the benefit of getting 1 or 2 extra casts off during a fight as outweighing the fact that you don't control what you shoot?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, how can anyone think hunters are being babysat when ALL their targeting is a mess? If the pet is on anything but passive, it will just do random shit and select random targets (why is &quot;aggressive&quot; even a choice? It is insane to use it). If I hit any attack with no target, it grabs a random target and fires at it. If I right click a mob, it fires an autoshot at it. Hunters are a class that is notorious for breaking their OWN CC.<br />
<br />
If anything, these notes are probably supposed to say that it NO LONGER switches targets automatically, because that's the only thing that would make sense.</div></div><hr />

being an &quot;average joe&quot;, doesn't make you bad, my younger brother plays, he doesn't raid cause he plays casually, that doesn't make him bad, in fact, he's also furious about these nerfs, it's alrdy faceroll for his blue gear, be it dps or healing.... so don't give us this crap of &quot;average joe&quot;, the people that fail in heroic, and welcome these changes are not the once &quot;not with time&quot;, cause honestly if you dont wanna take 30mins of your life to do 1 dungeon, gtfo and play a game that you can jump in mid-season and blast everyone, like counter-strike, something without character development and a learning curve.<br />
<br />
the bad players welcome these changes, cause it's hard not to stand in fire (lol removing fire path from twilight drakes in grim batol and removing imps from steelbreaker cause bad tanks are bad)... i did BRC 2 days ago, with a tank that failed horribly at keeping the stacks up and not spawning adds, after 2 wipes, he knew how to do it cause we schooled him at it, this very new and unexperienced bad tank, learned the fight from mistakes, not from mechanics being removed from it... and he was happy with the help, and tbh i was happy with helping him, rather then going &quot;don't worry, soon they will nerf this so it won't matter, and you wont have to learn to play a tank mate... so lets just skip this boss&quot;<br />
<br />
casual player != bad player, get that right... and casual players don't need these heroic nerfs, at least most casual players i know are experienced gamers, that just so happen to be at a point in their life, that they can't play for 8 hours... but they still don't wanna be spoonfed like your baddie friends</div></div><hr />

They made the &quot;heroic&quot; setting for a reason - for the &quot;hardcore&quot; players to get something to brag about. This of course is not how WoW works today. Honestly i don't care because raids have gone downhill since vanilla. I am not saying it was better, worse, harder or easier in the old days. I am only saying that things change over time.<br />
<br />
The 5-man dungeons are and were too hard for the average player. What you need to understand is that its one thing running a dungeon with a guild and its a completely different thing to run it with a pug of random non-english speaking players. The gear from 5-man dungeons is ridiculous and barely a bump in the road. Raids, same applies to them. The game has &quot;lost&quot; some of its meaning over the years. <br />
<br />
Just look at the &quot;new&quot; 5-man dungeons, recycled content with a whooping 353 ilevel. A joke.<br />
<br />
You guys even remember when WoW came out? How &quot;hardcore&quot; the mmo's were. What do you think will happen when a game, if that ever happens, come along that does the same to WoW? You fail to realize that the majority of players playing WoW are casual players that don't even raid. Of course they have nothing to do once they reach 85 beside running random dungeons and maybe some &quot;easier&quot; raid. Its a huge problem in todays mmos they have no real &quot;end-game&quot; once you get past the leveling.</div></div><hr />

The trash is virtually going untouched, barring a couple minor fixes)<br />
<br />
Blackrock Caverns<br />
Karsh Steelbender - If you got any skill in your groups (Tank primarily), when did you even last SEE a fire elemental add?<br />
Other changes were for minor trash abilities, to make them a little less annoying.<br />
<br />
Deadmines<br />
Ragezones... while far from needed, if 2 drop on your tank in a single pull (only 1 pull can do this) it can kill your tank before your healer can react.<br />
<br />
Grim Batol<br />
General Umbriss - Meh, quality of life for lower groups, for us, we don't care. I never even knew he HAD a bleed until now. The trogg change, while nice for ppl learning, has anyone even had issues with it that understands raid fight mechanics, since week 1?<br />
Foregamster Throngus - Again, more to help people learn. One my own guildies, on his first heroic tanking of GB, got gibbed by it, cause he wasn't aware when he goes to switch, to move away, in case he goes mace.<br />
The fire elemental spawns on Dragha Shadowburner, I applaude. That was annoying as hell.<br />
The 2 trash changes.... meh, far from relevant (there is 2, count them TWO, of those Twilight Drakes in the whole run, hardly a nerf).<br />
<br />
Stonecore<br />
Visual warnings only (and a change on the field of effect of Ground Slam, which I'm fine with, it was rather insanely massive). At the same time, I've had semi-bad tanks, have Ground Slam come the ranged DPS way, and yet survive, cause all the rocks erupted AROUND my warlock.<br />
<br />
Throne of the Tides<br />
The gilgoblin nerf was NEEDED. I don't care what anyone says, that was retarded levels of damage that quickly.<br />
Lady Naz'jar got a visual change, okay. The blight beasts on the Ozumat fight have a damage aura? I've been tanking it for months and never noticed, so no skin off my back.<br />
<br />
Vortex Pinnacle<br />
The knockback reduction, mostly quality of life, so your tank/melee don't get chucked off the platform. Can lead to wipes, depending on group's gear/skill level.<br />
Altarius is nearly a cosmetic change, but makes initial positioning easier.<br />
The &quot;no cast for 2 second&quot; rule is a nice, welcome change. Especially for the last pull, so they will get OUT of the damn grounding field (note: Only Paladin tanks can really pull the casters out, as their ranged silence is the only one not considered a spell and will hit them).<br />
<br />
Special Note: Wailing Caverns<br />
This change was announced, and showcased, on the Dungeons &amp; Raids panel at Blizzcon 2010. It is not a surprise, or new information. Basically, the maze of tunnels where Pythas and Skum are, will be removed and turned into a more straight-forward tunnel. That is all. And shorter.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Bitch about them nerfing Heroics when they nerf the HP and Damage Done of all trash and bosses by 15-50%. Alright?</div></div><hr />

Seriously, Blizzard finally makes some decent encounters post Wrath and then obviously gives in the the QQ of weak players. What ever happened to practice makes perfect? What are all these hand-held player gonna do once they get into 10 man?</div></div><hr />

If you read the thread, you'd have your answer: They won't. Blizzard is happy with where the raiding content is. Hell, the people who CAN'T do heroics well, will get face-mashed on 10M, or 25M, and then whine, but I doubt Blizz will budge there, cause they know that the people who CAN understand the fights, can do them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont get the change to Wailing Caverns. So after 6 years Blizz is redesigning whole instance? My guess is that their precious subscribers got lost in this overwhelming place. Perhaps they should consider changing it to the TBC style - instances should be long straight corridors again, we cannot force people to stop, look at the map and think.<br />
<br />
I think this is more a &quot;time spent in instances&quot; design change. Even when you know where you are going, at level it is painstaking to run through all those corridors.</div></div><hr />

If you make it unable to crit then a normal UA after the patch will do the same damage as an old UA crit. How would this deter any dispels?

Now, if UA does double damage AND were able to crit it would actually be scary. Otherwise people will still dispel it.</div></div><hr />

Questions: <br />
<br />
Why do you care if bad people get gear? They will still be bad!? Get over it!<br />
<br />
If you are so awesome, why do you even care about dungeons when you obviously<br />
are so insanely good at this game that you are in a high end guild that stopped doing dungeons<br />
a long time ago!? Get over it!<br />
<br />
Its basically this;<br />
<br />
Elitist players are QQing over bad players QQing over the game being hard which<br />
makes elitist look like idiots.<br />
<br />
Get over it!<br />

<br />
The &quot;just cancel cast&quot; argument doesn't work either. As there will be times with a split second is left.<br />
<br />
LOL @ Blizzard for thinking this is a good thing. The auto acquire target and auto begin shooting bug/feature was one of the dumbest things to pop up in each of the last 20 patches.<br />
<br />
@Moralio: Wailing Caverns sucks. It still takes an hour to clear and I think there are mobs still stuck in the ground after 6 years.<br />
<br />
Of course there's also the predictable whine about dungeon nerfs. Possibly the most shrill of all WoW whines. The nerfs are justified because no one who has a fresh 85 would want to spend inordinate effort to grind out a new obsolete gear set on an obsolete tier just to get to the next tier. For people that complain so much about it, you show little actual understanding of the reasons behind it.<br />
<br />
Also lol@Blizzard for simply removing achievements because they couldn't get them right. I'll miss my Storming the Beach.</div></div><hr />

I thought to myself... I have done a heroic on any of my three toons in a month, Even that month ago, randoms were really freaking terrible. I sincerely doubt they will get much worse than they currently are, regardless of if they finally make a change to the daily heroic just being walking into a dungeon, looting a chest, and getting your raid gear to... do non-raid content in. Good players could already carry groups in general, plenty of times practically solo or even actually solo the content. Bads have NEVER been pressured to be good this expansion. (Casuals have been getting their butts kicked by the somewhat challenging raid content, which is cool. Go casuals!) Bads will NEVER be pressured to be good. Until such time as bads start realizing they aren't enjoying the game (how can you enjoy doing less damage than any single one of the tanks abilities? and dying?) and either l2p or gtfo, we might as well make heroics slightly closer to being soloable in case any of the actual players of the community decide to go through the fires of hell to gear up more alts.<br />
<br />
And that, ladies and gentleman, is a wall of text.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, if you're REALLY an elite badass player, you'll be in the new troll dungeons anyway-which, judging by Blizzard's design philosophy for Cata, will be so dreadfully overtuned that people in 359 gear will find them rough going. Some of these changes aren't nerfs, they SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AT ALL. Who thought it was a good idea for the invoked flame spirits in Grim Batol to have the ability to chase the tank? Unless you're lucky about the placement, 9 times out of 10 that's a wipe. The Throne of Tides trash that got nerfed is so irritating people simply don't go that way anymore. 346 heroics are going to be lower tier soon, what's wrong with making them more manageable for people in 330 gear while people who are geared move on to the troll ones?<br />
<br />
And if you have a complaint about Wailing Caverns, it shouldn't be the elitist &quot;waaah they changed it for the casuals&quot;, it should be &quot;what the hell took them so long?&quot;</div></div><hr />

This is why you should get into a raiding guild that works out well with your schedule of playing. It's not hard and it takes a few hours of your WoW time if done right. And most often, you don't have to deal with them once you're in one, unless the guild is inactive or small.<br />
<br />
And on the subject of &quot;Bind to Account&quot; item, we can really see that Blizzard is trying to do something with them to make them easier to be send over cross-realm. However, it's only by a nudge and not really a big change so far. They probably want to keep robbing us of our money by continual use of the Character Transfer program, which works for some people but not others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, explain to me how many boss encounter mechanics got turned from one-shot kills, into survivable hits?<br />
Last I checked, NONE. Lrn2read a lil. Comprehension works wonders. I got a list of all the actual impact of the changes on page 11, and guess what? Aside from two very SMALL changes to damage from a couple minor boss skills, it's all visual indications, not DAMAGE.<br />
<br />
Fail players will still fail, they just might get closer to not. And if they stumble into a raid, their face will get rocked, and all is right in the world anyways.<br />
<br />
Again people: It's quality-of-life, or the odd visual indicator change mostly for the &quot;nerf heroics&quot; crap. When they nerf damage done or health of trash and bosses by more than 5%, THEN it's a nerf. Cry when that happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard didn't build its house on the money of the elite. They built it on the bads like me and my friends. We want our game to be played in hour chunks so we can go watch something on TV. We want raids that are done in a couple of hours while we talk about sports over vent. We don't want to worry about reading websites to figure out the absolute best way to solve rotations issues. We just want to log in, play, win, and log out.<br />
<br />
It's an added bonus that it frustrates the hell out of people who define success by how good they are at a virtual job. :cool:<br />
<br />
Oh don't misunderstand. I don't blame you for making this game into a facerolling snorefest since Wrath and doing it again. I blame Blizzard for catering to your demands because, as you said, most of the wow playerbase is infact made of whiny entitled scrublets who would rather get EZ mode epics for nothing instead of improving their game. It's within your nature to be bad just like it's in the nature of children to whine and pout and throw fits when they can't get the cookie before they eat their veggies.<br />
<br />
What Blizzard SHOULD do is give multiple difficulty modes for all dungeons and raids instead of just &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;heroic&quot;. They should keep normals as they were in the beginning of Cata, keep Heroics as they were at the beginning of Cata, a &quot;hard&quot; difficulty in between those to make the curve a bit more managable. THey should also make &quot;Easy Level&quot; dungeons and raids for all the entitled scrublets like you who refuse to play the game as it should be played, a challenge. The gear that would drop from Easy Level raids and dungeons will be lesser iLevel and have a tag on it that says &quot;Easy&quot; instead of &quot;Heroic&quot;. That is actually how it should have been from the start.<br />
<br />
But it's not. Instead, Blizzard is fearing a mass money loss the same way parents fear their kids will tell them they don't like them anymore and pout and cry when they don't get the cookie before they eat the vegetables. They cave, and both you and the kids are the ones who get spoiled, and the game itself is what suffers in the end.<br />
<br />
Well, enjoy your eZ mode blues anyway. At least Blizzard has yet to cave into your demands by making the raids EZ mode and let's pray to God they don't.</div></div><hr />

You should email blizzard, or post on the official forums. I'm sure their designers would enjoy reading how you feel their game &quot;should be played&quot;. Also, grats on outting yourself as someone who measures their own self worth on what color/ilevel your gear has. At this point, why not just play any other dress up doll game if that's what matters to you? Does it really hurt you that much that others can get the gear you, as non-&quot;scrublet&quot;, should have gotten almost 4 months ago when cata and it's heroics were first released?<br />
<br />
Honestly, Blizzard has it fine. &quot;Hardcore&quot; players have heroic raid encounters. The next step down is your dedicated raiders, who have regular raid encounters. Then your more casual players have heroics. If you even care about this, you either put way too much value on trash gear, or aren't as &quot;hardcore&quot; as you think, if you value the heroic gear so much that it'd hurt your e-peen. You can save the slippery slope arguments on whether or not raids will be nerfed; logical fallacies shouldn't ever make their way into intelligent discourse.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolly</div><div class="date">2011-03-31, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the second person I've seen say this... This is not a fix or an addition, this is how hunters work in game currently. It, however, is NOT a good thing. All our shots automatically acquire a target if pressed and casted shots sometimes just switch and fire at a new target if your target dies midcast. It's one of several reasons hunters accidentally pull the next group and/or break CC. You DO NOT WANT this functionality. It is horrible. Horrible horrible horrible.<br />
<br />
How can anyone see the benefit of getting 1 or 2 extra casts off during a fight as outweighing the fact that you don't control what you shoot?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, how can anyone think hunters are being babysat when ALL their targeting is a mess? If the pet is on anything but passive, it will just do random shit and select random targets (why is &quot;aggressive&quot; even a choice? It is insane to use it). If I hit any attack with no target, it grabs a random target and fires at it. If I right click a mob, it fires an autoshot at it. Hunters are a class that is notorious for breaking their OWN CC.<br />
<br />
If anything, these notes are probably supposed to say that it NO LONGER switches targets automatically, because that's the only thing that would make sense.<br />
<br />
agreed 100% The only thing I can think of is they can't fix the bug so they're calling it a &quot;feature&quot; . It drives me into a nerdrage of beyond epic proportions every time it happens on my hunter.<br />
