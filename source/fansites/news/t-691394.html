Europe - PvP to PvE Realm Conversion: Vek’nilash<br />
As part of our continued efforts to balance the World of Warcraft player population across all realms, we will be converting one of our lower-population European PvP realms -- Vek’nilash -- to a Normal PvE realm. For players on Vek’nilash, we will be offering free Character Moves to alternate PvP realms both before and after the conversion takes place. This will allow us to continue to support healthy communities on the realms and help new players transition easily into the community.<br />
<br />
The conversion will take place on February 10, with the Character Moves opening on January 27 and lasting until March 10. Upon being converted to Normal PvE, Vek’nilash will be given the “New Players” flag to ensure an influx of players over the coming weeks.<br />
<br />
For any questions, please refer to the main thread in the Vek'nilash realm forum:<br />

Blue posts<br />
Reasons behind Season 8 delay<br />
Because information in the next minor content patch is needed to start it and the patch is not out yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22748958184-yo-why-delay-the-arena-season.html))<br />
<br />
Quel'delar for tanks<br />
We talked about this back when the quest was available on the PTR, but in short, we are not adding a tanking specific weapon to the rewards table for this quest. We did not forget tanks, we just weren't aiming the rewards at them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22748777973-queldelar.html))<br />
<br />
Threat issues in the first seconds of a fight<br />
This is something we talk a lot about. On the one hand, good healers know not to overdo it in the first few seconds because the tank is unlikely to die anyway. On the other, it's a bit awkward that threat issues are exponentially more dangerous in the first few seconds than in those that follow. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/22748775349-when-will-the-prot-dps-buff-come.html))<br />
<br />
Balancing classes in Wrath of the Lich King<br />
Yes. We have made a few mistakes in the 3.X patch cycle where we over-buffed or over-nerfed a spec. Aside from the risk that we'll have to revert some of the changes, it just sucks when say all hunters felt like they had to go Survival or all mages felt like they had to go Arcane. Ideally your spec would be a choice, but we feel like the second best scenario is to not keep changing which spec is on top (especially when that requires you to re-gear, etc.).<br />
<br />
Players also tend to have different expectations for dps than we do. It's typical now for anyone who doesn't see their dps at 10,000 (or to see simulation output that suggests 10,000) to assume that something is wrong with their class. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22749567797-tell-me-this-is-a-joke-patch-notes-332.html))<br />
<br />
[...] We believe you can't just balance around the best players. It's possible for a class to be too good among less-skilled players (perhaps because it is easy to play) or too good among highly-skilled players (perhaps because only they can get the full benefit out of it). You need to look at players at a variety of skill levels.<br />
<br />
You also have to be very careful trying to correlate population with power. I'm sure there is a correlation, but it might not be a very strong one, at least in PvE. It is probably more true of PvP. In PvE, a lot of other factors can influence population. Most new players to WoW have a pretty good idea of what a warrior or mage is, but may not understand the mechanics or role of a shaman or warlock. Some players just gravitate towards certain mechanics and find others bland or frustrating. Players can make life-long decisions about their class based on things as non-power-gamery as art or possible races.<br />
<br />
Where we tend to take notice is if something is really far out of whack. If players are abandoning a class or flocking to a new one, then there might be something going on. If particular classes or specs seem to fall behind in raid representation over time, it's usually in our best interest to at least try and understand why.<br />
<br />
Our community, especially the active online component, has become very obsessed with class equality over the course of Lich King. I'm sure some of that is the increasing sophistication and maturity (in the sense of understanding mechanics) of the player base. (Remember, a lot more players are running heroics and especially raids than ever before in WoW's history.) I'm sure another is partially the fault of myself and other developers for being relatively more vocal about our design goals and intent. Overall, I think the community would be healthier if it focused more on boss strategies and less on intra-class competition, but I understand that a competitive streak is something that goes hand in hand with being a hardcore gamer.(Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22748797321-whos-raiding.html))<br />

Moonkin T10 4pc Bonus<br />
The spell level of Languish (the tier piece proc) is too low, causing an unintended high level of resists. We can hotfix this. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22749567377-blue-response-to-moonkin-t10-4pc-please.html))<br />

Protection damage in 3.3.2<br />
The damage you're going to do depends a lot on your gear, raid buffs and personal style. But I think these are in the ballpark for an Icecrown 25 guild.<br />
<br />
Shield Slam -- hits for maybe 3500.<br />
Revenge -- hits for maybe 3000.<br />
Devastate -- hits for maybe 2000.<br />
<br />
Over the course of a raid, Shield Slam and Devastate might do about the same total damage, with Revenge doing 50% of that. (In other words, if we ignore all other abilities, you'd have a pie chart with a 40%, 40%, and 20% slice, though Revenge can be pretty variable.) So at first glance, you might imagine a world in which Devastate eclipses all other abilities. But let's consider them in more detail. You're probably using Shield Slam half as often as you're hitting Devastate because of the cooldown. Are you going to give up that much damage packaged into one GCD? Now Revenge on the other hand might be a contender for another Devastate GCD, but consider the enormous rage bargain that is Revenge, even that doesn't seem like a big concern. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/22748775349-when-will-the-prot-dps-buff-come.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking questions<br />
1. Are you saying that you want to move back to a pre TBC style of instance tanking where there is far more CC used? (I cannot imagine how ugly that will be training DPS to CC again)<br />
It would be nice if there were more of those pulls. BC might have been too extreme the other way where many of the trash pulls felt like boss encounters in terms of risk and planning. But maybe every third pull or something you'd need to say &quot;Okay, we have to pay attention on this one.&quot; <br />
<br />
2. Are you going to add some complexity to our rotation (priority/procs?) <br />
Yes, that would be nice. <br />
<br />
3. Are you planning to remove 360 style AOE abilities or just weaken them (damage/threat)? <br />
<br />
I don't think making the tanking abilities harder to use is the answer. I'm not even sure making them do less threat is the answer. If AE dps wasn't so effective and if tanks were at greater risk of dying to 5 pulls, then we'd end up at the right place anyway.<br />
<br />
My point earlier was we aren't looking to make generating AE threat trivial because hopefully it will be less essential and differences in how tanks AE tank won't turn into big problems. Some tank abilities are probably essential, such as a taunt, survivability cooldowns and a way to generate snap aggro on a single target (yes, DKs, we hear you). We hope not every tank ability needs to be shared across all 4 classes, or else the druid just becomes a warrior with different art.</div></div><hr />

any decent tank will have different set and tier was the avoidance set, badge gear was for the armor set. and since they changed 2 piece, the avoid set will need one piece with extra armor to get 4p bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Problem is that it isn't even a good ring if it's worse than the Agi Ring for Str classes - it's a clear sign of shitty design. It was suppossed to be variant for Str classes, not a crappy downgrade. For Rets, it's a 36 dps downgrade - there is absolutely no reason to choose this ring over its Agi variant until Cataclysm comes.<br />
<br />
But even with a +240 Str proc, it would be still inferior to the Agi ring - that's how bad designed this ring really is.<br />
<br />
A ring with ideal itemization for all Str classes to make full use of its item budget would have been:<br />
- Str<br />
- less Sta<br />
- Crit<br />
- a bit Hit<br />
- a bit Expertise<br />
- Str proc</div></div><hr />

Why are people so concerned by this and sooooooo upset by it?<br />
<br />
<br />
It makes them feel important. Technically, his post informing the &quot;first&quot; offender can fall under the same rules he reported that kid on. People need to read the rules of the forum before they go and start being thread police.<br />
<br />
Back on topic. This ring is a lot better for STR DPS'rs. With the rings I have now, I would lose DPS if I were to switch the one that's currently in-game. I am happy this is finally dropping.</div></div><hr />

For DKs, Warriors and Ret Pallys STR&gt;AGI. Stat weights are different for each class/spec but AGI/Crit isn't always at the top for Plate DPS. Also, the hit rating is easily covered in gear/ench/gems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, I am fully aware that stats have different weights for different classes and specs. I'm talking about the stats on the ring, given its itemlevel, compared to the agility one. <br />
<br />
This should be correct, the proc set aside - it's the same for both rings.<br />
Agi/Str: 1<br />
Sta: 2/3<br />
AP: 0.5<br />
Hit/crit: 1<br />
<br />
Sum on Agi ring:<br />
Agi: 88x1 = 88<br />
Sta: 84x(2/3) = 56<br />
AP: 135x0.5 = 67,5<br />
Hit: 59x1 = 59<br />
Crit: 59x1 = 59<br />
<br />
Sum: 329.5<br />
<br />
Str ring:<br />
Str: 99x1 = 99<br />
Sta: 107x(2/3) = 71.33<br />
Crit: 59x1 = 59<br />
Hit: 59x1 = 59<br />
<br />
Sum: 288,33<br />
<br />
Again, correct me if I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />

AP: 0.5<br />

Hit: 59x1 = 59<br />
Crit: 59x1 = 59<br />
<br />

<br />
Str ring:<br />
Str: 99x1 = 99<br />
Sta: 107x1.5 = 160,5<br />
Crit: 59x1 = 59<br />
Hit: 59x1 = 59<br />
<br />
Sum: 377.5<br />
<br />
Isn't Sta suppossed to be only 2/3 instead of 1,5? Besides that, there is also the factor of diminishing return when stacking stats, but it shouldn't be that harsh for such a slight increase.<br />
<br />
Edit: Wowwiki should be right about the Sta value of 2/3 - I just did the math with the Def ring compared to the Agi ring and the Str ring:<br />
<br />
Def: 327.67 (would be 436 with Sta = 1.5)<br />
Agi: 329,50<br />
Str: 288,33<br />
<br />
Long, short story, this ring is woefully under its budget.</div></div><hr />

I agree - the yellow socket is fine, but it's kinda sad that all other four rings get 5 stats while we get another 4-stat ring with tons of useless Sta.<br />
<br />
The ring is definitely under its budget (over 40 itemization points which could be another 40 combat stats, calculations above), but even if they fix it sooner or later, guess what aspect they will buff? Much more Stamina.</div></div><hr />

Also don't get how an item level 277 ring only gets +4 str than regular (264) ones.<br />

I'd prefer the crit, seeing as how the only thing I lose with the Agility ring is AP, whereas with the Str ring I lose a ton of crit for a measly amount of AP :-\</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. In ICC gear even with several pieces not having defense you have to search really hard to get below 540. With 245+ gear you're at at least 570+ without any defense enchants. If you're forced to sacrifice other items you're doing something weird.</div></div><hr />

WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br />
WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br />
WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br />
<br />
You plate dps (mediocre plate dps as none of you could ever touch my numbers on my hunter) whined for a ring and you got one and now you pull ideas out of your ass that it is inferior to the agility ring? <br />
<br />
Solution? USE THE AGILITY RING THEN YOU DUMB FUCKS. The way you talk, this is what your ring should look like:<br />
<br />
190 str<br />
190 stam<br />
increase crit<br />
increase hit<br />
increase expert<br />
increase ArP<br />
increase haste<br />
<br />
Proc that increase strength by 2342948204820343. <br />
<br />
Whiney little crybabies. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think they are complaining because they expected a ring that was at least comparable to the AGI ring, or at least better itemized for STR DPS classes (because hit is hard to find and they need the stam because they will get hit a lot /sarcasm).<br />
<br />
BTW enjoy being taken over by Wells Fargo!</div></div><hr />

I'm sure some of that is the increasing sophistication and maturity (in the sense of understanding mechanics) of the player base. (Remember, a lot more players are running heroics and especially raids than ever before in WoW's history.) I'm sure another is partially the fault of myself and other developers for being relatively more vocal about our design goals and intent. Overall, I think the community would be healthier if it focused more on boss strategies and less on intra-class competition, but I understand that a competitive streak is something that goes hand in hand with being a hardcore gamer.(Source)<br />

The ring makes up for itself in str cause blizz actually thought about all the str multipliers into that 90 str now when you see that hit you shouldn't think oh theres hit that ring sucks you should think oh theres hit lets replace some hit on this piece of gear so i'm not over the cap!</div></div><hr />

Your comparison is entirely off base because in fact many classes who use agility prefer AP over it for some reason or another (rogues, hunters, ferals near crit cap, also enh shamans in general). Where on the other hand EVERY strength user prefers strength over AP.</div></div><hr />

But no one said anything about it, except a few people. Everything is being overshadowed by the str ring. This is a very good example that for most who play this game, it's all about gear then enjoying the game or learning about some important stuff which will improve the game and make it more fun. <br />
<br />
<br />
That.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanking questions<br />
1. Are you saying that you want to move back to a pre TBC style of instance tanking where there is far more CC used? (I cannot imagine how ugly that will be training DPS to CC again)<br />
It would be nice if there were more of those pulls. BC might have been too extreme the other way where many of the trash pulls felt like boss encounters in terms of risk and planning. But maybe every third pull or something you'd need to say &quot;Okay, we have to pay attention on this one.&quot; &quot;<br />
<br />
Honestly this part makes me really really happy.I can hope at least for more interesting trash fights now that a blue mentioned it.Even if they dont give our classes any new spells this feature of more &quot;sophisticated&quot; trash fights alone makes me feel excited.</div></div><hr />

I wondered so much why they removed a stat completly from the parts and put +1000 on it ??? I do not understand this change at all. <br />
<br />
Good morning Blizzard, This is THE TANK T10 Set. This should be the best inslot Item until Cata is on the market.<br />
You can upgrade it to T10/7.5. <br />
So why removing a stat from it ? <br />
A high level gear tank don´t need +def at all. We have more than enough of def. What we need is expertise. All the L264 stuff has hit on it. HiT Hit Hit.. I can´t stand it anymore. Give us expertise. <br />

Let´s say a BIG Mistake...<br />
- A ring everybody wants but nobodys using it because ists crappy<br />
- Changes in tanking gear nobody wants but everybody must use <br />
<br />
Let´s see what next. Funny things going on. Blizzard always stated that the community and the huge player base are the most important part within WoW for them. If this is somehow true, why the kicking in our face again and agian? I mean farming these bullshit emblems of frost t o get T10 is more than boring enough and now these changes for tanks. Are we to imba for ICC with this stuff on? I can´t believer or... let´s think this way arouond --&gt;<br />

I personally still prefer the emblem gloves but the chest looks apealing; will see if the emblem one or t10 will be the choice, depending on what other items i already have.<br />
<br />
Anyhow.... most of the tanks went for t10 head+shoulder and all the armor offset items (as theres no head+shoulder with armor in game atm), now after the changes we have a choice of getting the (2)set with different pieces :)<br />

On a side note, i do agree we should also have a choice of an avoidance set for specific encounters. Oh well.</div></div><hr />

You, sir, are the clueless one. For my Unholy DK the strength ring is a 51,69 AEP or a 31,014 DPS upgrade from the agility equivalent. It might not be as good for us as the agility ring is for it's target group, but it does not necessarily mean the agility ring would be better for us plate wearers than the ring targeted towards us. True, some plate classes might benefit more from the agility ring, but you're generalizing by saying it would apply to all and that anyone wearing the ring would be clueless.</div></div><hr />

I suggest everyone to do the math with their own character's EP values rather than blindly following someone else's. But either way it seems that for Unholy DK's the strength ring should be an upgrade over the agility one regardless of their current gear and other factors.</div></div><hr />

Erm..if you think bear tanks are overpowered then you obviously have no idea about tank classes and the balance between them. Bears have more hp and armour because their have less avoidance.<br />
<br />
Blizzard pretty much finally got the balance between the tanking classes right at 3.1, and then got closer with 3.2.<br />
<br />
Now plate tanks are getting their tier buffed. Why are feral tanks not getting the armour on their tier buffed?<br />

Avoidance was trumped by Chill of the Throne (because avoidance depends on the diminishing returns of the rating to be cancelled out by the increased returns of net avoidance. When that balance is distrubed it hurts all avoidance gains). In fact theorycraft shows the expertise hard cap to be more useful than avoidance. For people who only do 10man content the emblem +armor tanking gear was easily BiS. And the difference between the +armor 264 gear and the heroic 277 gear was not as clear as it should be. Also I see this as a glimpse in Cata gear; with defense gone it would be nice to see +armor appearing a lot more often on our gear.</div></div><hr />

actually i would complain if there was agility proc - rogue's already on a fine line when it comes to more MELEE crit cause we have so much already it would be really bad for a lot of rogues with 251/ 264 gear.<br />

agility doesn't affect poisen crit and would only be half the AP of an AP proc for poisen applications too</div></div><hr />

Item Level 264<br />
Equip: Increases defense rating by 63<br />
Equip: Increases your parry rating by 63<br />
<br />
+ 153 armour<br />
- 39 str<br />
- 9 stam<br />
- one socket<br />
+ 8 def<br />
- 63 parry<br />
+ 54 hit<br />
<br />
This is compared to 232 tier, but the difference from the 264 is + 80 armor, +21 stam and + 10 def currently, If I have done the differences right, the 264 once updated will come out at 2541 armor, the updated kraken will come out at 2658, have an extra socket, and still retain the def and parry. You can pretty much close the small stamina and def gain the 264 tier gloves have over the offset with the single socket alone if you wished.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there anywhere I can find the information on the updated Gauntlets of the Kraken?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

BOTH of my tank sims currently have the damn 251 warrior tier gloves ranked BEST IN SLOT after these changes if they are finalized. They will be the BEST gloves in the game currently, and they can be upgraded to be made even better? Any person who knows $%&amp;#38;# about plate tanking has learned that stacking armor and stamina is miles (or km) ahead of avoidance in usefulness when actual math is done. Blizzard acknowledges this and has only just made the warrior tier items USEFUL with this change. <br />
<br />
My sims also currently rate the tier piece with the new stats as 4th best in slot, underneath 3 different gemmings of the Cataclysmic Chestguard &lt;-- another +armor piece. When it is upgraded with the tier token it will PROBABLY BE BEST IN SLOT aside from the 277s, WHICH IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.<br />
<br />
This is all based on the assumption that blizz will not be buffing the current offset +armor pieces, however. I do not know who said that they were going to do that or where they got their information.<br />
<br />
That is the problem with the average forum scumbag. You all talk about logic whe nyou don't even understand the word. Keep using your feelings. The real tanks use their calculators.<br />
<br />
The lack of expertise is troubling, however. <br />
<br />
Stop whining about the lack of tanking Legendarys. Legendary items don't need to be fair. Each spec of each class doesn't need or deserve to have one. Legendary weapons are for LORE purposes.<br />
<br />
Blizzard does not forget classes, they do not punish people for playing classes, they do not just randomly buff/nerf things. They put a lot of effort, time, and research in to what they do. Exponentially more than any of you whiny turds who complain about things they don't even understand have.</div></div><hr />

It was suppossed to be variant for Str classes, not a crappy downgrade. For Rets, it's a 36 dps downgrade - there is absolutely no reason to choose this ring over its Agi variant until Cataclysm comes.<br />
<br />
But even with a +240 Str proc, it would be still inferior to the Agi ring - that's how bad designed this ring really is.<br />
<br />
A ring with ideal itemization for all Str classes to make full use of its item budget would have been:<br />
- Str<br />
- less Sta<br />
- Crit<br />
- a bit Hit<br />
- a bit Expertise<br />
- Str proc<br />

To be frank I'd rather there wasn't a welfare hilt weapon, it's all about having the money to buy it, stick with the good tanking stuff from bosses. There are also a fair few tanking weps for us, mace and sword from 10man ICC so far, the 25man mace is an unknown as of yet but 25man does seem to lack a real solid stat weapon rather than a proc based one. I will be aiming for the sword despite having the mace.<br />

<br />
Blizzard pretty much finally got the balance between the tanking classes right at 3.1, and then got closer with 3.2.<br />
<br />
Now plate tanks are getting their tier buffed. Why are feral tanks not getting the armour on their tier buffed?<br />
<br />
I hope Blizzard has not &quot;forgotten&quot; that bears tank too.<br />
<br />
<br />
blizzard did not forget bear tanks. they are buffing the other tank classes because bears were too good imho. that's why you get tons of armor and only lose a little avoidance. armor is better than dodge/parry/miss/block, just do the calculation and don't depend on random numbers for tanking.<br />

For a fury warrior (+20% str), it's the choice between 112ap (str) vs 1,4% crit chance (agi).<br />

I think it should make a bigger difference for STR wearer, than just losing 1,4% to take 112 ap.<br />

So much bitterness and QQ hypocrisy... So what plate DPS class do you play?<br />
<br />
Take what you said about it being best for five out six plate DPS specs only meaning the opposite and you would be right.... The stats on these rings blow and it IS inferior to the AGI ring as I and others have already said repeatedly. Never mind that it's undeniably under budget or just flat out awfully itemized for its level and compared to other rings. The only way this ring MIGHT be better is if you're over the crit cap for white hits....</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.There are never items with STR and AP. Never.<br />
Thats also one of the reasons why agi items can be better then their str counterparts for str users. The agi items get either more item budget or simply having agi AND ap outweights the pure str. <br />
Also, str items tend to have more stamina, which is, in terms of dps, useless.</div></div><hr />

It is true that everyone complains about their individual class because it's not the best. I believe that differentiation is an important element in any mmo and is necessary when representing a variety of unique classes and specs.<br />
It seems like everyone wants equal dps to eachother, in which case, classes become hemogenized and the only difference from class A and class B are the buffs that they give to the raid (as well as a few different casting animations).<br />
Something I did enjoy about BC is that certain classes were expected to top the damage/healing meters while others were included to support those classes (rogues and warlocks being the top DPSers). You leveled your character understanding that you wern't going to top meters but none the less leveled that class anyway because you enjoyed the play style or the utility. I also understand that this made class representation in raids terrible. Abunch of rogues for melee and abunch of warlocks for casters and only one of each other class simply for the buff. An in the middle would be nice. Maybe something like stacking buffs to force class representation where the more of this class you have, the stronger the buff gets. I know that this idea isn't perfect either, just something that was on the top of my head.<br />
The madness to all this text comes from the fact that Devs are obviously getting frustrated (as you can see in this post) by the player base being ridiculously demanding and pulling the game in a direction that the developers don't want it to go. Read your class description before you play it, if it doesn't sound great, then look for something else. Blizzard will make sure that every class has a place, somewhere, in this game. People should want to be the best amongst their own class, not compare themselves to all the others.</div></div><hr />

I agree, they should, but they don't rly have to :P <br />
It would indeed be nice if they shifted the stats abit, though i wouldnt place my bets on adding arp, haste or such...as these stats are not of the same value for every STR class. Actually i dont believe they would add 1 more stat ... IF they would boost the ring i guess it would be jsut more STR <br />

Imagine that each class represents a company that makes an individual product. That company would stive to mkae the best product of all of it's competitors. For example, there's a ketchup company that only makes ketchup and a mustard company that only makes mustard. It would be silly for the mustard company to want to be better than the ketchup company because they sell 2 different products. The mustard company would just want to be better than any of the other companies producing mustard. This is how WoW should be, be the best within your own class and stop comparing apples to oranges (or in this case, ketchup to mustard).</div></div><hr />

ive always been very carefully with critizising blizz for their patch policy and so on. in generall, i think theyre doing a great job, even though some changes in the past seemed to be not fair or not necessary for a huge amount of players; they always had their reasons...<br />
<br />
...but THIS change now with the tier sets just makes me very very angry!<br />
<br />
how can it be that they make just some weeks after release of icc/frost badges such significant changes to the tier items! didn't they think of it before the new items release? and yes, i really mean &quot;significant&quot; changes. every serious tank has already accurately planed his gear decisions and even spent frost badges on specific items and now these plans are in some cases completely bullshit! thinking about my armor, deff rating, expertise and so on changes just makes me very mad...<br />
<br />
furthermore i dont understand the item point changes at all. why the hell they are now switching avoidance with eh gear stuff? before you could build up i nice eh gear set with frost badges and maybe the head and shoulder tier items for a threat push. but what is with the new tier set? before you could focus on straight avoidance, because therefore the tier set was very nice. but now they remove dodge from hands and deff from the chest and replace it by armor? why the hell theyre mixing eh and avoidance up? going for 4parts or more will be - as we say in german - &quot;nothing full and nothing half&quot;... other example: using the tier chest and the craftable legs will make it quite impossible to get crit immun... <br />
<br />
last point: im feeling really sorry for all the plate tanks that have now spend ther badges on unusable gear...<br />

Sacrifice certain stats for armor is a bad idea. Whether armor is the preferred stats for tanks in ICC is still under heavy debate. It will certainly cause a lot of people to change their gear decision. As one of the paladin tanks, we should at least be offered an option to refund the frost badges (and armor tokens if we own a lvl264 piece) if we don't like this change.<br />

This is not a new issue and it's not a flaw with the ring specifically. There are no stats missing. <br />
<br />
Because of the way itemization works, when you spread the budget between 5 stats instead of 4, you end up with a more potent item, so even though agility and raw AP aren't as good as strength on a direct basis, the fact that you wind up with so many extra stats outweighs the supposed weakness.<br />
<br />
Of this we are all aware. And if you had read the fucking thread before you deigned to bestow your almighty wisdom at us, you would know that the Str ring does not have an equivalent number of stat points to the Agi ring after diversity is taken into consideration. The Agi ring is properly budgeted for an ilvl277 item, but the Str ring is budgeted for more like ilvl264. As a result, the Str ring only provides a DPS gain for Unholy DKs - and not because it is well itemised for them, but because the Agi ring is horrible for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all it is because blood tap is on a 1 min CD (just like divine plea and enrage).<br />
Second, it is because it is an ability that hardly costs you anything (a little bit of health or it could be free if you have minor glyph which you should) so you can use it whenever you want, and I also believe it is off of GCD but I'm not too sure about that last part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, my normal defense was 565 up until ToGC 10/25. And you say you're above my DK with just heroic/emblem gear on defense? Cool. Are you ALSO capped on hit, AND expertise? I'm very nearly capped on expertise, and use expertise food to bring me to the cap.<br />
<br />
And, just like the poster right after you said: Can you tank Festergut, or Rotface, in your heroic/emblem gear? Tanks have to carefully balance which upgrades are worth it, or not, to bring cap to THREE stats. Now Blizzard just slaps me in the face and brings me below the most important cap.</div></div><hr />

I feel like these changes (prot in mind) are completely wrong. Lets take dodge off a tier piece and throw on some more armor? In my mind this is just stupid because takes are supposed to take damage. The more avoidance we have is supposed to help not nullify damage taken. By adding more armor you are once again making the game even easier, and the more seasoned raiders like myself are going to be given even less of a challenge. I can't wait til you say screw epic gems adding avoidance and stam then just throw one in that gives more armor. Anyway enough of my rant as far as the str ring goes yay. There aren't many good &quot;ret&quot; rings and this may not be a BiS however its definately a nice, easily obtainable option over say something with armor pen.</div></div><hr />

That said, it's not too late for the stats to be reworked again, and the chests to have defense added again and the dodge rating removed. Both the non set chest and gloves have defense rating, so I'm not entirely sure why they went with removing the defense from the tier chests.</div></div><hr />

i'll be fine i'm sat at 577 def at the moment so i'll still be capped but frankly i think it's a really crap thing to do.....first remove 20% of our dodge in ICC really screwing over those of us that loved avoidance and then we're gonna remove your dodge and def, wtf?</div></div><hr />

Its simply not cool to change gear values this drastically mid patch. Like most 25 man raiders I already spent 310 badges (nope i had not missed a daily). At the start of the patch I figured out what I wanted and moved that way, having to readjust and possibly buy different gear is annoying. <br />
<br />
The second complaint I have with blizz is in the blue post I don't feel it was honest. &quot;Due to number of players changing to armor pieces we made this change...&quot;(paraphrased). I think the honest issue is again our avoidance was crawling up higher than they liked. I check out big boy end game tanks, simply most are not rushing out to stack armor. Fights like blood queen, its simpler to not be hit than to have rediculous EH. They take about 1.92% off of the chest at the ilvl251, likely to crawl above 2% while giving 1k armor in exchage. <br />
<br />
Maybe hardmodes will flip my opinion, but current content doesn't make me go &quot;oh god more EH please&quot; like ToC and Ulduar did at times. Especially their hardmodes where a good RNG could just about kill a tank instantly unless they were near BiS.</div></div><hr />
