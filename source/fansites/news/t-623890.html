PvE raid content difficulty<br />
Keep in mind that guilds like this are comprised of people who have bested every raid encounter we've released since Onyxia and Molten Core. They've made it a focus for years now to conquer every piece of PvE content we put out there, and do it first. Knowledge, experience, and teamwork are built rapidly when struggling through so many different boss encounters.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not arguing that the raid content is any easier or harder than in the past. I've not done any of the 25 man raids yet. I do get the feeling though that the majority of the people I've seen on the forums specifically arguing that the content is too easy, based on the performance or opinions of the top guilds of the world, have not experienced the content either.<br />
<br />
Is it possible you will draw the same conclusion when you've cleared every 25 man encounter through Arthas (when his time comes)? Of course. When your intuitions grow into experience after you've made such accomplishments you'll have better ground from which to justify your disappointment.<br />
<br />
Of course we're monitoring your feedback and experiencing the content ourselves. I reiterate that we'll always consider adjusting content for greater ease or difficulty if we feel it is necessary to maintain a fun and rewarding game.

<br />
PvP Balancing<br />
It is certainly our goal to make all classes competitive in Arenas. I think we have made improvements from BC. I don't think we're there yet. We are going to learn a lot when more players are at 80 and everyone starts to try out different strats and comps. I do feel pretty comfortable predicting that the issues players are worried about now will not be the ones we're all worried about in 3 months. Dark horses always have a way of sneaking up on you.<br />
<br />
I understand the problem with perceptions, and it can sometimes be frustrating that players who can be so well-informed about their own classes could be so out of touch with changes that have occured to other classes. It's just a big game. We definitely can't buff classes or specs just as part of a PR campaign to shake people's mindsets. But that will come with time.

We will be reopening free character transfers to the PvE realm, Fizzcrank, on Wednesday November 19 from 9:00am PST to 2:00pm PST. If you are looking to transfer to this realm, please be prepared to do so during this timeframe. No characters will be eligible to use the free moves to this realm once they are complete. <br />

PvP balance and Deterrence<br />
With only a couple of exceptions, every change we made to hunters and every new talent we added were done to address specific concerns of players. You're in fantastic shape for PvE and if you are indeed still too low in PvP as you suspect, then we'll get that taken care of. We have a Deterrence idea we're working on right now, but I don't want to say any more until we're farther along. One reason I don't say as much about future plans as I could is players tend to get really upset if we change our minds or the implementation takes longer than we think. Somehow my mentioning &quot;we're working on it&quot; gets turned into &quot;broken promises&quot; and then everyone gets their torches and pitchforks.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/paladin.jpg Paladin (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=610) / Talent Calc. (9095) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
Upcoming changes to paladin's talent trees<br />
Not every talent tree has those clickable abilities at the 11, 21, 31, 41 and 51 spots. We might eventually give Protection and Holy and 11-pointer and we have some ideas on what we would like to do, but mostly we want to see if there is anything they are really lacking that filling the hole could solve.<br />
<br />
A taunt is not a particularly interesting talent. It's a button you ideally never want to push and often when you have to push it, it's because someone else in the group messed up. This is why we are leaning towards just giving paladins a brand new ability to taunt, but I'll announce it for sure when we are sure.<br />
<br />
Paladins received more changes to core mechanics than any other class in LK, so I would not be at all surprised to see changes to their talent trees over the next few patches. Holy, IMO, is likely to see the most work. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/12661344664-not-the-11point-talent.html))<br />
<br />
Leveling as Holy + buffs in Patch 3.0.x<br />
That’s a bit of a misinterpretation, though I suspect I don’t need to point that out. The Holy paladin is a healing spec. If you take that spec, it’s with the expectation that you are giving up some other strengths in order to be a good healer. We don’t want leveling to be horribly painful for you, but to be honest, I don’t think it is. My answer was more that if you find leveling as Holy (or Protection or Discipline or whatever) too slow, then you do have the option to respec. Many players do. Shadow is probably the most common case of a spec that is used to level even by players that fully intend to heal.<br />
<br />
You also make it sound as if we somehow broke existing gameplay here. Healers have never been exceptionally fast at leveling (and neither have tanks for that matter). We think we made things a little easier with the changes to spellpower and similar adjustments for tanks, but I would be surprised if your relative (for your level) dps actually went down between BC and LK.<br />
<br />
Also, you are still going to want multiple sets of gear even with this change. Once you hit level 80 and get your stuff gemmed and enchanted it is going to be better for one role (healing, dps, PvP) than for others. The spellpower change makes healing gear better at dps (and vice versa) but it doesn’t mean they become the same thing. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/12666204323-healers-respec--gc-hath-commanded.html))<br />
<br />
[...] I don’t actually think Holy paladins get different and substandard treatment. You did get hurt by the Ret nerfs, and as I said, we intend to compensate you for that. It will be in the next patch, which will be before the 3.1 Ulduar patch. I think it’s exaggerating the issues in order to make your point to describe the Resto druid, Resto shaman, Holy priest or Disc priest as fast leveling specs. I’m not even convinced they are faster than Holy paladins (and if they are I don't think it's from their dps). Many druids level as Feral and many shamans as Enhancement, so I don’t even think the issue of Holy paladins needing different gear from their dps spec is completely fair.<br />
<br />
Some classes and specs level fast, and in many cases that has more to do with their mechanics (often stealth and travel) and not their dps. But there have always been players willing to level as just about any spec, and they are all viable. It has never been our goal to make all specs and classes level at the same rate. We’re not advocating re-specing constantly in order to level up but still run as groups, but if you choose to play that way, you’ll probably find enough quest rewards to be able to build multiple sets of decent gear at once. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/12666204323-healers-respec--gc-hath-commanded.html))<br />
<br />
Holy Guidance requiring 5 points while the similar Ret/Prot talent only require 3<br />
We'll look into this. I do want to caution players in general that we aren't necessarily trying to make similar talents identical across specs. Sometimes it depends entirely on the spec or the rest of the class. You can think of many examples of talents that one spec would love to have, Sheathe of Light maybe. <br />

Fan of Knives cooldown removed in the future?<br />
We think we are going to remove the cooldown of Fan of Knives altogether. There are just too many PvE situations where rogues feel at a disadvantage without a reliable ranged attack. The example that came up recently is Meathook in CoT:Stratholme and having the spawning zombies causing pushback on your healers. Rogues can FoK once and then have to run over to help the healer.

<br />
1 - Just like we know a bear or mammoth isn't flying, we also know that a bear is a bear and a drake is a drake (we don't really need a &quot;type&quot; column.<br />
<br />
2 - Have a &quot;cost&quot; column so you can get rid of the description clutter and it's more easily readable (and you can sort by cost to get the cheapest ones first)<br />
<br />
3 - Change &quot;drop type&quot; column to &quot;aquired from/by&quot;. We don't really need to know it's a merchant, we need to know who that merchant is. Some of that info is already in the description but it's better for readibility to have it's own column<br />

The content was cleared, for the most part, in the same gear they wore at 70. Personally I do not like gear-check fights to begin with, but I still find this ridiculous. Where is the progression? Waiting three months for a content patch where the next hardest raid instance will be cleared in a matter of hours? I know this is meant to be entry level content, but even Gruul's Lair wasn't the push-over these raids are in the beginning. I just find it disappointing that the game has become this easy. <br />

<br />
<br />
To change that Blizz would need to drastically change itemization.<br />
<br />
Sunwell Epics are at ilevel of 164 which are around the same as LK blues at around (my guess) iLevel of 180, which are pretty much very, very near a &quot;blue&quot; limit for lvl. 80 items.<br />
<br />
IMHO itemization is pretty much screwed and done the wrong way. To much emphasis to gear up at lvl. 70 (end-game) with epics alone. <br />
<br />
LK is the proof of that.</div></div><hr />

That's just insane. What can possibly cost that much form vendors, you can't gather yourself?<br />
<br />
It's meant as a gold sink, along with the other vendor-bought mounts and Dalaran rings. It's needed as the cost of raiding has gone down, and gold from dailies is still easy. Besides it's nothing you won't get by selling a few frozen orbs on AH right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvE raid content difficulty.<br />
<br />
I dont mind that it is a bit easier to raid but make me gear up at least. I shouldnt be able to clear Nax in level 70 gear.<br />
<br />
What level of gear should they have? If they were in full epic lvl80 gear they'd have almost equal quality gear to what was in there anyway. And lvl 78+blues are only marginally better than tier6 in many cases, ie. where tier 6 has 50 spellpower, lvl80 blues have 60 spellpower, lvl80 epics have 70 spellpower, and so forth. The total overall difference across a full set of gear is about 100 - 200 spellpower, that's the difference between a trinket being procced / used. <br />
Then there's the &quot;right&quot; enchants and gems to use, which isn't always easy with blue gear as you'll be replacing it with epics soon, so you'll perhaps take a cheap +int over an expensive +spellpower one.</div></div><hr />

couldnt agree more. I find it hard to believe that I will still be playing wow 3-4months down the road unless they up the difficult, but i think that is rather hard to do now. No one wants to go into a heroic they could easy master when they just hit 80, to find it buffed after they gained the gear they wanted from it, it should have been the other way around. <br />
<br />
To the paladin holy spec, I have never tried a worse leveling spec even pre 2.4, and that is across prot warrior, holy/disipline priest. The only thing that I have tried which was as anoying or close to, was leveling druid when the game was initially released, but compared to what huge changes they have implemented since then I find it rather ridicilous that the holy spec is that crappy. But on the other hand, retri is so over powered that you would be kinda insane not to pick that anyday over holy, and even if you want to heal instances from 70-80 retri is just fine, with a healing set.</div></div><hr />

On the issue of utility, yes our design is that nobody has an ability so awesome or critical that they are gauranteed a raid spot. In truth you can get all of the important buff and debuffs with a relatively small number of players (especially in a 25 raid) so you should be able to bring who you want after that. If some classes bring versions of a buff that are obviously and significantly superior to another's then that is the sort of thing we'll get fixed. (Source)<br />

<br />
Well you need 2 paladins in every raid - one for kings and one for sanctuary. Failure right there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
A disc priest provides grace, which is the same as sanctuary. Plus he provides fortitude which stacks with everything else. So you probably want a disc priest + pala with kings.</div></div><hr />
