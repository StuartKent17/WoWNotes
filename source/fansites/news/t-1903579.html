I'm just being realistic the zones look a lot smaller and for how much people are paying for the expac it seems to be fair to expect something on the scale of at least an inbetween of WOD and MOP. The reason I bring up the mountains is because of how much of a pain Spires of Arak were to traverse due the spire designs and cliffs and I'm just fearing a repeat of that agian.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have absolutely ZERO scale here. You have absolutely no idea if they're smaller based on this composite map. And you're gonna whine about the most interesting zone in WoD? Seriously? And dragging out &quot;For how much people are paying...&quot;? That is the kind of cheap emotional dig that makes me instantly disregard your blather.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The top image on the right is of Kalimdor, there is an island to the east, it's crudely drawn with numbers scrawled on it. Below the top 2 maps is a map of the Eastern Kingdoms zoomed in above Dead Wind Pass where you can see Dalaran floating right above where Kara is.<br />

<br />
Yep. This is almost certainly why. Khadgar sucking up all of that residual magical energy around Kara(which there is a fucking lot of thanks to being on top of ley line convergences and all of Medivh's experiments) to buff Dal's defenses so the Legion can't attack it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure how you compare exactly but Dal looks pretty small compared to zones such as Highmountain and Azsuna?<br />
<br />
On a side note, what island is that that's directly south? Just west of Thal'Dranath?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Sure, let's say it is a little smaller (which is debatable and hard to say in this case because we dont know how far out this is zoomed, etc etc. It could be larger than what the map shows due to perspective and whatnot, but anyways), people are forgetting that they are also adding a ton of BRAND NEW AREA'S with the Artifact gathering, PLUS CLASS ORDER HALLS. Sure some are just gonna be updated versions of existing places, but there are also going to be a ton of COMPLETELY NEW places relative to these 2 things.<br />
<br />
Plus, if they stick to the &quot;more stuff to do in the world&quot;, I'm all for having a slightly smaller continent, if it means getting more meaningful content/less unused space. It's easy to make a zone seem huge when 1/3 of it is barren wasteland with absolutely nothing to do (See Dragonblight, Stormpeaks, Borean Tundra). I'd prefer a smaller, more compact/more things to do/less time spent travelling than a pointless, open area with 0 content.</div></div><hr />

Chances are they asked for volunteers, and we don't even know when beta is officially going to start. What about the retail workers you mentioned? Don't seem as worried about them spending time with their families as you are worried about the Blizz employees not getting to go shopping. Yeah, the gaming industry is the bad guy lol</div></div><hr />

Like I said in my edit, smaller space with less travel/less unused space &gt; large unused/barren area's. Plus the addition of all the new area's that aren't on Broken Isles (Class Order Halls and the Artifact locations) make up for a slightly smaller continent.<br />

Just looking at the maps side by side (and trying to get Dalaran to be the same size on both maps)the new continent looks to be a little bit more than half of Northerends size.</div></div><hr />

And, if it's anything like the PTR, unless the servers are crashing, 4 days of nothing happening on the beta servers is nothing, considering it will be up for 5-6 months. It would be the first week, too, IF they release the beta next week. Not a whole lot happening anyway - let people start the content that's working, start populating the beta forum and collecting notes from in the beta, no problem. They went weeks on the PTR with the garrisons being completely screwed up before they fixed them. <br />
<br />
And, I'll admit, I'm surprised to see anything being out already, I thought it would be in January - get past the holidays, then release the beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That unused, &quot;boring&quot;, pointless space is what makes the world feel more like a world, though. There doesn't need to be five million demons, ghosts, dragons, giants, or whatever every square mile. Having some wide open spaces may be boring to run across, but it's better than a smaller zone cram packed with stuff.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Looks&quot; and &quot;knowing&quot; are 2 completely different things though. You can't honestly say that northrend didn't have much empty space... judging from the minimap I would definitely say broken isles has less empty space. <br />

<br />
Irrelevant, At the moment going on current and past expansions there's still a lot of empty space in the Legion beta map (Not saying the entire map should be used either).<br />
<br />
An easy example is the Storm Peaks, It's padded out with a fair amount of mountainous terrain. The actual usable land is probably half of what the map shows.<br />
<br />
The northern most zone in the Legion beta map is similar in that regard, though it looks like it's not as empty.</div></div><hr />

With less space means wall to wall mobs and be like SWToR where you walk 5 yards from 1 mob to the next i do not like wall to wall mobs like some space and yeah most of time smaller world means lest quest less things to do because there is nothing there and with mountians making you walk around means less and less stuff All im saying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A demonic trio, consisting of an Imp, Voidwalker, and Felguard. Imp is the intelligent of the three, Voidwalker is the egotistic one, and Felguard being the dumbass: <br />
<br />
Imp has dialogue when encountered: &quot;NOBODY expects the Legion Inquisition! Our chief weapon is FEL! Fel and FLAME, flame and fel are our two weapons... Fel, flame, and ruthless invasions are THREE weapons. Fel, flame, and ruthless invasions... and an almost FANATICAL DEVOTION TO SARGERAS are FOUR!- No wait. AMONGST our weapons... Amongst our weaponry are such elements as fel, flam- I'll start over again.&quot;</div></div><hr />

My guess is that it's part of the &quot;go to Broken Isles&quot; quest line. Just like you had to trek across Tanaan until you landed at the site of your garrison, you might have to face the invasion, then board Dalaran over Karazhan and &quot;move&quot; with it to its destination. So that minimap would be a phased version of Deadwind Pass when you're at that questline step.</div></div><hr />

(Nope, not for fapping reasons, I am a straight female. I just prefer the look of armor on a belf female, it is the most aesthetically pleasing character model for showing off armor and weapons)<br />
<br />
Not really, belf females are too small... human males are the most neutral of the ingame models, they have decent shoulder/head size compared to the rest of the body. <br />
Also i wouldnt be surprised if blizzard originally made human male first and then started contorting their body to create the rest of the races. <br />
<br />
But belves have way too small shoulder armor to be visually used as mannequin, and their gloves are tiny.</div></div><hr />

They are definitely the best model for cloth armour. DH sets should also be presented on a BE or NE model.</div></div><hr />

I was first at odds with Mage T8, but since BE girls have curves now, I strongly favor the look on my mage. :D<br />

Some variance would not hurt anyone. What about a priest look with tunic &amp; trousers for a change? &quot;Anduin's Regalia&quot; or something like that. :3</div></div><hr />

I like how brought up them being listed as garrison missions on page 10 of this thread in a calm, &quot;what you all think these are&quot; and no one reacts, then the guy posts freaking out gets responses lol<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm thinking they are either pre launch event related or hopefully daily quests that we ourselves go on.<br />
<br />
They did say we would have class npc followers, so it could be that we are sending them out to do stuff, and if thats the only part of garrisons that remain thats cool. i was never annoyed by the mission table something i can do every day to make minor progress when i don't have time to play.</div></div><hr />

Also, I feel like those Nightmare characters are just illusions or echoes that were created by Xavius in The Nightmare. Sort of like what happened in The Endtime dungeon during the Dragonsoul patch. That gear looks amazing btw. I love the look of the first cloth armor, with it's hood down and no shoulders (although the latter may be changed). It'd be really cool if you could right click your helmet to put the hood on for those rainy days :).</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure the Class Halls are still going to have some type of mission system. Not as intense as the Garrison, but it will exist, and I think that is what those missions strings are for, but are likely marked as Garrison missions in the back end (since it would be based on the same tech)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ugh, no. I doubt Sylvanas' clothing has piss all to do with SJWs, and more just a new model because she's actually getting involved in things. Blizzard always changes/updates the model of the expansion or patch's main characters. Vol'jinn got it, Thrall got one, Garrosh got two, Anduin got one in the past and another right now, Malfurion and Tyrande got theirs, the Prophet Velen got one, even Genn fucking Greymane is getting an update. They are just updating her model for relevance, and like what was said at the cinematic panel, she's got her battle-armor on now, because the upcoming fights she's going to be in are huge. <br />
<br />
What would you have them do? Take off more of her clothes in her update just because some vocal minority of idiots might agree with Blizzard's design choice? No one likes SJWs, but the folks that actively hate them are arguably just as bad, if not worse than SJW. They've become just as childish in their shouting about how much they hate X and X that you couldn't tell the two groups apart anymore. Just two obsessed vocal minorities screaming at each other until recess.</div></div><hr />

It will probably be updated, and possibly Enchanting-exclusive at that like the wolf from Leatherworking and the carpets from Tailoring. If not, then it's still a chicken that'll be readily available in-game whilst the Magic Rooster, even if heavily duped or something on US servers, is running out in terms of copies available for sale.<br />

She's an undead elf mary sue who shoots magic arrow at inhuman speed and came back from being shot in the fucking head. I don't think her vulnerable stomach is an issue. I really don't mind the added armor on its own, but more the attitude behind it. And the color. Why the fuck is it brown? It should be purple like the rest of her armor.

<br />
She came back from being shot in the head because of her Val'kyrs. Which are dwindling in numbers. It made her realize that she was being careless with her mortality. It makes perfect sense for her to bulk up her armor and underlay it with chainmail. It's not at all about feminists crying about half-naked women... Hell, they even put elevated heels on her boots instead of keeping them flat like they were before!</div></div><hr />
