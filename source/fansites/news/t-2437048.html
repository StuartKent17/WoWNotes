Good news is that Brack can do more as President of Blizzard. Bad news is that Ion &quot;I had too many drinks in Vegas with Holinka&quot; Hazikostas is clearly in charge now of WoW. :(<br />

Congrats to Brack but it is a big blow to the WoW franchise but a big gain for Blizzard overall!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I feel the same way in that without Brack I do wonder about the future of WoW. But as President maybe he puts WoW back on the front of the spear instead of being sat on the back burner?<br />
<br />
I have mixed feelings on this but my gut says Brack will bring new ideas and this will be a good thing for Blizzard overall. But in the mean time I do wonder how WoW will function with his departure. o.O</div></div><hr />

LMAO. Not even close.<br />

Ion is going to go down as the worst. That is basically a forgone conclusion now that he doesn't have Brack/Chilton to carry the load for him.<br />

Hard to say if he was utterly and completely right about a product that has not yet released, but anyway, a simple &quot;We understand all the memories involved in Vanilla but right now we prefer to focus on the live game&quot; would have been perfectly fine. Being nice to one's own fans and customers doesn't take much effort, even if sometimes they might (possibly) be wrong.</div></div><hr />

Gods help us. A lot of people are negative about the game now, everywhere, on YouTube, twitch, twitter, the official forums (they're always negative on the WoW forums but whatever) and then to have this guy take over... right now? When the expansion isn't in a good state? Pure coincidence I guess.<br />
<br />
Content wise, I think Blizzard will never make the same mistake like they did in WoD... but the design of current game features and mechanics... the way everything is forced behind RNG, even crafting, which has multiple walls of RNG you have to break through; expulsom and random stats on gear as an example. It's awful.<br />
<br />
Just like in WoD, there is another thing; communication. It's not really starting off well... both Ion and Lore seem pretty clueless and trying their best to dodge actual questions and then come up with half-asses answers. Having Lore call people dickbags, and whether that is directed at WoW players or not is irrelevant, he posted that shit right after the big Azerite discussion when people got mad at him. Just another coincidence I guess. Either way, quite unprofessional for someone that is supposed to be a professional community manager. And quite frankly, it makes him sound like just that, a dickbag who thinks his mental health is bigger than yours.<br />
<br />
And now we get this memelord J. &quot;u think u do but u dont&quot; Allen Brack taking over. <br />
<br />
I'm still subbed, and surprisingly enough still playing, but the magical trio of Ion, Lore and now this guy better prove us wrong and actually act like they're competent people in a billion dollar company.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most likely, Mike is just satisfied with what he has accomplished. He probably holds a lot of shares and his 1 year salery probably is as much as you'll earn in 10 years or even more. It's just reasonable for him to enjoy 2nd half or last third of his life while he's still able to actually enjoy it. Settle down just before his 51st birthday (Nov 3rd) is not too unusual. <br />
<br />
For the conspiracy guys among you (nothing that I personally would hope) but there might also be an underlying medical condition.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
I personally don't have an opinion if this is good or bad. Mike's openen ceromony speeches always seemed a bit stiff and somewhat cringy to me. Mike was the only person that made hefty use of teleprompters and his talk was not as fluent / freely spoken as it could have been. There are much better examples of good keynote speeches in the tech-industry. Mike probably was a good CEO but he never struck me as charismatic as Chris Metzen, Ben Brode, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk (whatever you may think of him).</div></div><hr />

Ya he is most likely leading the WoW classic team lol.

It will lure in players who didn't play classic, because classic had RPG and MMO elements that were removed during and after WotLK, in favor of QoL.</div></div><hr />

The timing of this is pretty suspect. My guess is he is being forced out due to how bad BFA. He has probably lost control of the ship as evidenced by all of blizzards mishaps. BOD said its time to go . He wont be the only one. Ion and a bunch of devs wil be shit canned as well</div></div><hr />

Are you fucking dense? World of Warcraft isn't the be all and end all of things at Blizzard. A few things you dislike about an expansion for a single game they develop isn't why the guy is stepping down from his role that has literally fuck all to do with the development of WoW.

This is funny, honestly. Did you even play WoD? If that was the case then they'd probably just shut down WoW and Blizzard would go bankrupt because of how bad WoD was.</div></div><hr />

To young if you haven't made bucketloads of money like Mohaime has. He could have probably retired 10 years ago if he really wanted to.<br />

Not true, every time I've worked at an organization during a leadership change, the differences were noticeable very quickly, and increased exponentially as time passed (to a plateau obviously). As players, feeling the effects through content which is all largely already finished, the impact will be filtered, but 1-2 years? Unlikely to take that long. Perhaps Brack won't make a lot of waves, it's hard to guess what his style will be, but the interviews I've seen with the guy were disquieting so I'm not really hopeful.</div></div><hr />

He's the CEO of the company - you really think this is about warcraft forum depression? His function is to shake hands, grease palms and show charts to committee meetings and Activision board rooms. It's debatable if he even reads the message boards, let alone has any game design input.<br />
<br />
EDIT: &quot;Knowing it is good and still gets hated to the bone&quot;... do you hear what you're saying? You just have to look at D3 when it was released to know that is a stupid thing to say! &gt;_&lt; Sure, D3 when it launched was great... for a fucking outdated game design idea in 1998. I remember saying to Bashiok that this is the Skyrim generation - you need to appeal to TODAY'S gamers! A few moths later... blam... adventure mode hits to save its ass.</div></div><hr />

Correct, but what we do know is that it's less than 1 month until blizzcon, the largest media-function event Blizzard puts on every year - and having CEOs step down before the company's single-most important media function of the year isn't really considered the most savy of moves.</div></div><hr />

8.2 is definitely and 8.3 is also likely too close to completion to change. For sure could see some changes for 9.0 though. I even doubt they could drastically change the launch content of 9.0 at this point. At least not adding zones etc.</div></div><hr />

There's hardly a better time to introduce the new President of Blizzard Entertainment and say au revoir to the former President than at Blizzcon. It's not a matter of being savvy. It's a matter of allowing people the time to say hello and farewell. I'm sure that both of them will have things to say in the opening ceremony.

Have to wait and see. Producing a video game is not quite the same as heading a multi-billion dollar corporation, but you can never know if he'll be up to the task or not ahead of time. Big shakeups in the executive office are always a concern, because it can tank a company very easily - and quickly, especially if investors get spooked.<br />
<br />
Can't just wave this one off, this is a BIG change. I worked for a company where a new CEO drove off 60% of the core customers away in less than 4 quarters, and led to massive layoffs and downsizing, and their competitor getting most of the marketshare, and they've never recovered since. New CEOs usually want to put their stamp on things, with big changes, so...we'll see. Big projects have a way of being unfunded in leadership changes in big corporations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, 3 days after a financial quarter ends makes more sense than halfway through. I highly doubt Blizzcon has anything to do with the timing of this. <br />
<br />
If you really want to be conspiracy minded, consider that Activision Blizzard would have the initial financials for Q3 now, had two days to review them, and decided that new leadership is needed at Blizzard. That would not be anything out of the ordinary in corporate America.<br />
<br />
But, we don't know, and probably never will know why this is happening. Morhaime could be sick. Or just burned out. Or wants to do something else, he has enough money to retire on a beach somewhere, and his kids might be in college and he and his wife are downsizing. Who knows?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before J. Allen Brack became CEO, he was Executive Producer, which means, he was the budget-guy, which massively influenced what was being created. Now, as a CEO he is also able to give a general direction to what the game should evolve to. <br />
<br />
No matter what, the team which created Warcraft stays the same. Ion Hazzikostas was game director before and will it be afterwards. And all the devs which created the massive successfull legion and now BFA, will also create future content.<br />

but hey players that only know of him and probably never spent any time with him probably know alot better how he is at work and what it takes to be president over a big company like Blizzard.<br />

And you probably know him REALLY close ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)<br />

<br />
I'm probably reading too much into it, really. But that particular wording makes me feel like it's not something he really wanted to do. It doesn't feel the same as when Metzen retired.

<br />
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that with gold much more limited in BfA and offerring a mount for cash subscriptions, the company lost a sizeable expected (based on previous expansions) sum of money from people buying the expansion digitally through tokens. I think that's a reasonable assumption. Whether that played into what's happened here is questionable. Probably not, but it does make me wonder. Can't help speculating.</div></div><hr />

I would guess you are right, based on his choice of words. I've seen that happen a few times in my career, managers choosing words like that when we knew behind the scenes it wasn't their choice to move on.<br />
<br />
I've always felt Morhaime seemed a little disconnected though - not really getting the vibe from the player base, so I'm looking forward to see what J. does. I was saying the stuff J. was saying about Vanilla before he said his infamous &quot;you don't want that&quot;. Otherwise, I felt J is less transparent than most and can appreciate him saying what he did, versus the rest of the development crew only saying that when we can't hear them. Basically to say, if he disagrees with me, he's more likely to be open about it and I'll know where he stands.</div></div><hr />

True. I'm going to do the usual and take my &quot;wait and see&quot; approach. It'll take a couple of years before I get an idea of how this affects the company as I am not really familiar with J.</div></div><hr />

It's just a logical assumption.<br />
<br />
Mike didn't really reveal why he was quitting, and made a big deal about how we should make World of Warcraft a great place with a great community.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if I were to guess, he is taking it somewhat emotionally. It isn't unlikely that he didn't want to quit. The question is, then, why did he? Was he burned out, or was he pushed out? The former I'd understand and he'd have my utter respect for lasting this long, but the possibility of the latter is highly disturbing.

Of course the decision was premeditated. Morhaime didn't just come into the office the other day and tell everyone &quot;I think I'll hang it up now. Allen, take over. Everyone OK with that?&quot;<br />

As for stock sales: People have a very inflated idea about the effect of World of Warcraft on Activision's stock price which is much more dependent on what's going on with the tech sector than any division management changes.</div></div><hr />

Morhaime was the CEO of Blizz... not WoW. That definitely effects stock sales. But yes, you're right that WoW doesn't effect Acti/Blizz's stock like it used to. CEOs stepping down/changing, however, do. ;P</div></div><hr />

Apologies, I should have quoted the &quot;think you do, but you don't&quot; video. That's what im referring to in the second paragraph and finishing it up with some fan fiction drama imagining J. Allen Brack secretly loving vanilla and deposing Mike Morhaime to deliver it.<br />

he is filthy rich with more money he can spend for his entire life from wow peak days (seriously wow during wrath era probably generated more money than any other game that ever existed), first was Metzen who is literally warcraft itself (and probably sc and diablo too) dropped because he was 'under stress' (can u name a single living human who doesn't work under stress and still suck it because he needs to eat?), now Mike with how every blizzard game going (overwatch nowhere near its high, died very fast, diablo blizz hate it nowadays, RTS genre again is nowhere like the early 2000s/late 90s, and current exp has 2nd most hate after WoD) he probably taking his rest too since nothing force him to work<br />
I'd dropped working way earlier too myself with how much cash i'd have from just wrath era<br />
<br />
I guess the good part about this is that J Allen Brack knows more about &amp; cares more about WoW than Mike Morhaime ever did. Hopefully he takes things in a different direction, but Im not gonna get my hopes up.<br />
i doubt someone who joined way late in warcraft history care about it more than someone who was literally in company since wc1 days</div></div><hr />

It's not gonna take anyone away from retail. It's not a threat, it's a support to the retail and main game. If it is baked into the same sub, then it'll be a nice secondary game to the main game. <br />
<br />
If anything, it'll bring more players back to WoW rather than push people from it. This'll be a huge financial success for Blizzard, I can already see it. It's gonna make them a ton of money.</div></div><hr />

Unless you work for Blizzard you wouldn't know if making Classic would harm in any way for Blizzard to consider making some other project. Classic itself is probably not that expensive to make and it will most likely earn its money back with profits in the long term. The Classic hate comes from somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

I know that money spent on that project cannot be spent on ordinary WoW. It can do nothing but increase budget pressure on other Blizzard projects, including ordinary WoW.<br />

You don't know that it wouldn't be spent on ordinary WoW either. <br />

It's a business bet: resources that go into Classic will return a future ROI sufficient to further fund other projects.<br />

You're assuming that any kind of assumption is a wild assumption. You can base an opinion on logic. It doesn't make it a fact, but it's certainly not just a wild, crazy thought. A wild assumption would be that there is absolutely nothing going on with this transition and that Mike was absolutely fine with it.

But hey, that's just me.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zenocide</div><div class="date">2018-10-07, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems, deciding to create a classic WoW reincarnation was based on populism. A small minority supported by a former WoW dev (Mark Kern) cried very loud, and the negative PR made blizzard to react.<br />
<br />
Now Mark Kern works on WoW Classic for Blizzard ( https://twitter.com/Grummz ) , and they have hired new people to make a classic redo with modern systems (battle.net, phasing etc.).<br />
<br />
I believe this is going to be successfull at start, but many will return to play retail or quit again, after they discovered it is not the same as like on start of classic. I liked classic because it was my very first MMORPG experience. And a new world to discover. And to learn basics about classes. All that will not be there in a classic reboot. Sure, i will create a char. Sure, i will play a little bit, but it will not be the same as 13 years ago.<br />

QFT. I'm sorry but when Brack said &quot;YTYD, BYD&quot; he was 100% right, and people will realize it way too late. <br />
I myself carry some of my best memories in 13 years of WoW from Vanilla and BC. But just thinking of going back to those game mechanics makes me cringe.</div></div><hr />

Look at what he did to League...QFT!!! GC is a huge disaster!! He never thinks in long term consequences, only very short term.</div></div><hr />
