The skies over Azeroth are growing darker. . . .<br />
The Legion pre-expansion patch is coming soon, and we wanted to give you a heads up about what to expect—and when you can expect it.<br />
This update will include a wide variety of features and content that set the stage for the expansion, including system changes, quality-of-life improvements, and major in-game events. Some of these features will be available immediately, while other content will be unlocked in the weeks leading up to the expansion’s launch. Read on for more details.<br />
<br />
The Opening Salvo[/b][/size][/center]<br />
When the pre-expansion patch initially goes live, players will be able to immediately access many of its key system-related features. Some of these major updates include:<br />
<br />
Transmogrification Updates<br />
<br />
The new Transmogrification Collections system will make it easier than ever to collect, store, and sort through the gear you want to use for transmogging—without taking up storage space in your inventory, bank, or Void Storage. As you collect items that can be used with the system, you can browse through them—as well as sort by class or slot—in the Appearances tab in your Collections interface.<br />
Class Updates<br />
<br />
We’re making some significant changes to classes and their specs for Legion to further strengthen their identities. The core changes to spells, talents, and more are going into effect as soon as the pre-expansion patch goes live. For more information on what’s new for each class and spec, read our earlier class preview blogs.<br />
<br />
We’re also making it easier to switch between specializations for different content. Players will be able to queue up for dungeons, raids, Battlegrounds, or Arenas as any role that is available to their class, while continuing to play as another role while they’re waiting. When they enter the content they’ve queued for, they will automatically switch to the suitable role upon entering (at no cost) and then switch back automatically when they leave the instance.<br />
<br />
The March Toward Legion[/b][/size][/center]<br />
In the weeks following the pre-expansion patch, we’ll be unlocking even more content that leads into the August 30 launch of Legion. We’re still determining the exact timing of these events, but players who pre-purchase Legion can expect to be playing a Demon Hunter around the second or third week of August (no later than August 17 globally). We’ll share more details in the weeks ahead, but here’s a look at what’s in store:<br />
<br />
Burning Legion Invasions<br />
<br />
Before all hellfire breaks loose upon the Broken Shore, the Burning Legion will begin its assault upon Azeroth, turning some familiar stomping grounds into demon-infested battlefields—and it will be up to the heroes of the Alliance and the Horde to face the onslaught.<br />
<br />
Demon Hunter Early Access<br />
<br />
In the weeks before launch, those who have pre-purchased Legion will get early access to the new Demon Hunter class. Players will begin at level 98 and will find themselves on the fel-shattered expanse of Mardum, where they’ll play the Demon Hunter starting experience before joining their allies in the fight against the Legion.<br />
<br />
The Battle on the Broken Shore Begins<br />
<br />
As the situation grows more dire, Azeroth’s heroes will begin their first foray onto the Broken Shore—the epicenter of the demonic invasion.<br />
All of the features and content listed above (save for Demon Hunter early access) will be available to all World of Warcraft players, regardless of whether they’ve pre-purchased Legion.</div></div><hr />

While I would love that, hardcore, I just... have a hard time believing the 12th? No pvp season ending announcement, or anything of that sort... I mean I want it soon like anyone else, but I have to look at blizzards track record on how they do things, too?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's in July, won't be in august.<br />
<br />
With this post, you can be certain the pvp end announcement will be next tuesday. Followed by patch on the 26th.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sounds like the 26th is the first &quot;target date&quot;<br />
<br />
26th pre-patch with class updates/appearance system<br />
2nd demon invasions<br />
9th DH<br />
16th broken shore<br />
<br />
BUT they gave themselves an extra week in case they can't hit the 26th...so the above could all be shifted + 1 week.</div></div><hr />

All rumors state july dates. Also the fact they already preloaded it, and the fact that they keep hyping it with new posts. Why would you think august?</div></div><hr />

In the past, that's always meant the patch is coming within two weeks. I wouldn't be surprised to see it go live on Tuesday. We're definitely going to see it before the end of the month. They'll want people to have time to enjoy the demon invasion and get used to all the changes before Demon Hunters are introduced.</div></div><hr />

They are clearly struggling to meet the deadlines and are hesitant to just say a date and stick to it, still too much to test.</div></div><hr />

As per a post made by Blizz some months ago, &quot;season end&quot; or season breaks are a thing of the past. I'll try to find the post and link it.<br />
<br />

<br />
There was no season break last time around. Just an announcement that next week itll end. So, they can still just say &quot;hey btw, it ends on patch day&quot;</div></div><hr />

I remember seeing something like this too. I think it was related to the new ranking/honor system and how it fundamentally changed the way PvP works.<br />
<br />
Also, I love the way they say &quot;The Legion pre-expansion patch is coming soon, and we wanted to give you a heads up about what to expect—and when you can expect it.&quot; yet give no date. Well, what we do know is that DH comes at the latest on August 17th, so there's that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ifeanychukwu</div><div class="date">2016-07-08, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think if they were ever going to release content that didn't really match the time frame that they've followed in the past now would be the time. What with the lack of content, the lackluster expansion that Warlords was and the extreme boredom that's probably going on right now on most servers it seems to me the perfect time for an early release of the pre-expansion event. <br />
<br />
My crazy guestimate would be this upcoming Tuesday with the 19th being the most likely date, IMO.</div></div><hr />

Yeah.<br />
If you want all the armor, that is 4 characters to cover the 4 armor types you need.<br />
Plus the other stuff.<br />
<br />
I need to level up 2 additional characters to cover plate and leather.<br />
<br />
I have seen little or no real evidence behind any date guessing.<br />
Not that it will stop anyone crowing about it if they got it right.<br />

<br />
Correct, because that is not flagged in your account.<br />
It is just like any physical product, it just puts you up the queue for receiving it.<br />
Which if you are lucky will be 1 day prior to release, or in my experience it has been the day on or after.</div></div><hr />

Well after testing the events out on beta it gave me a good idea of how long it will take to get everything and with only a few hours a day it will take a a while, and as you mentioned each armor type makes it take even longer.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who pre perchase gets access so i would guess yes since its a pre order unless your date of payment is pass the &quot;Qualified date&quot;</div></div><hr />

You can buy the transmog tokens on any character that unlocks the full set for 60 shards plate/mail/leather/cloth.<br />
<br />
Though if you have alts that have low ilvl free 700 gear to unlock it that way.</div></div><hr />

So any armor type set can be learned on any character, or just any can buy them - and they are boa or something ?<br />
<br />
Would be helpful if I didn't need to level more, since i'm really slow at it.</div></div><hr />

You have to pre-order online to get the early access. The cut off date is August 30th.</div></div><hr />

Just checked, and yes.<br />
They are bind to account.<br />
So even if there proves to be a requirement for the right armor proficiency, then I can level them later.<br />

Not really. Not in this case as you can easily refund the game up to 14 days from Blizzard's website. So its the same thing. If Blizzard made it so you couldn't refund it at all then I'd agree.<br />
<br />
There is nothing stopping someone from pre-ordering it from Blizzard and then cancelling days before Legion launch. Just the same as someone doing it with a pre-order to gain the Demon Hunter experience.</div></div><hr />

In the weeks before launch, those who have pre-purchased Legion will get early access to the new Demon Hunter class. Players will begin at level 98 and will find themselves on the fel-shattered expanse of Mardum, where they’ll play the Demon Hunter starting experience before joining their allies in the fight against the Legion.&quot;<br />

The difference is when you pre-purchase through Battle.net it immediately charges you the price of the game and applies it to your account.<br />
<br />
If you pre-order through a third party retailer, you don't get charged until it ships and you can't add the game to your account until you get the physical CD key and redeem it on battle.net.<br />
<br />
Has nothing to do with being able to refund. Pre-purchase is outright buying the game digitally before it's released, while pre-order is reserving a physical copy and paying for it when it ships.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course there's a need for an end of season announcement. I haven't PVP'd seriously ever (though in TBC I went for lowest 2's rating in the world... and got 2nd place...-_-) and I can understand the rage that would ensue if they dropped the patch without giving people ample time for last minute pushes and working out where they are and what they need to wrap up regarding something they potentially have been involved in for months.<br />
<br />
Oh, and servers will explode regardless. Blindsiding players with a stealth release does NOT foster goodwill.<br />
<br />
Looking at the promo/hype rampup and the PVP window I expect the 26th to be announced within the next few days as the date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are missing my point though. I could order through Blizzard and have it charged immediately and the license applied to my account. Play the Demon Hunter and anytime between now September 13th decide to refund it. Basically allowing me to play Demon Hunter without actually purchasing it.<br />
<br />
If I pre-order through another site I won't be charged until the 27th-30th. I won't be allowed to play Demon Hunter but can still refund it.<br />
<br />
One scenario you can play it and return it. The other you can't despite being able to show proof. What makes preordering with Blizzard more special since you can refund the game itself thus negating the whole preordering?<br />
<br />
If it wasn't for the fact that I can order it for $39.99 from legitimate websites and after ordering four copies (for everyone in the house) basically getting a free one I'd just order it on the website. Instead I'm having to order it for $39.99 elsewhere (because Blizzard feels a $49.99 price tag is justified; we've all had those arguments) and then after it arrives upgrading it to the Deluxe to get what I originally wanted and still saving $10.00.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really hopeful for the 19th but I'm still telling myself the 26th so that I won't be too disappointed if it's not the 19th. Today's biggest news is that it's &quot;soon&quot;. Well, we knew that already since the patch went on the background downloader. Jeez Blizz, give us a date! I need it! lol<br />
<br />
To be honest, I would be surprised if it was in July. Typically the pre-expansion launch only lasts roughly a month so it'd make sense first week of August or last week of July.</div></div><hr />

You don't pre-order with Blizzard. You pre-purchase.<br />
<br />
Once again, the difference is when you pre-purchase from Blizzard, Blizzard gets the money, and the game is applied directly to your account.<br />
<br />
When you pre-order from Amazon or wherever, no money changes hands. You don't own anything. You're just saying &quot;reserve a copy for me, I'll pay for it when it's released.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, they could probably work out a code distribution system with retailers to ensure people get early access, but that's a totally different thing. And frankly Blizzard would probably rather you buying it from their storefront instead of letting Amazon get a cut of your money.</div></div><hr />

That was my whole point though. You could prepurchase it now and then refund it days later which is still basically the equivalent of &quot;reserve me a copy&quot; since it's not like you get to play the entire game before everyone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How hard is it to understand that pre-ordering through any service other than Blizzard's means that your Blizzard account remains unchanged? If you pre-order Legion on Amazon, Blizzard wouldn't know and your account would remain flagged for the latest version of the game you have purchased on the Blizzard store. And no, Amazon and Blizzard - or any other retailer, for that matter - could not just communicate it back and forth because there are laws that regulate the sharing of customer information between companies that isn't in the public domain. Your purchasing information would fall under that personal information that companies cannot legally share, even with the creator or seller of the product. When you buy through Blizzard's store - refundable or not, because refunding a license has literally no impact on digital rights - they can enable it in their systems immediately. That's simply not possible with pre-ordering through third parties.<br />
<br />
I should also mention that being able to provide proof that you pre-ordered on another site means literally nothing to Blizzard, because you could cancel your pre-order as soon as they upgraded your account and wouldn't be able to tell. If you want to buy the game elsewhere and then complain about a company trying to protect its bottom line on a slipping product, then you should at least understand the most basic logic and reasoning behind why things are the way they are instead of just assuming that your way is the right way.</div></div><hr />

Hunter being the primary example. Myself and the Miss' have stated we're very likely to abandon our Hunters at 100 and not level them at all due to how broken our specs are.<br />
<br />
My main is in an equally disorganized, broken state, and while it's .. playable? .. In so far as you can understand your rotation and you know what to do .. it just isn't fun .. at all. I tried to trudge through leveling on the Beta and lost interest before even making it very far. <br />
<br />
Friends have all had similar reactions, who have Beta Access. Saying their mains just .. feel broken .. or very dumbed down.<br />
<br />
Many classes, their animations look much better but their gameplay has been left in ruin or changed in strange ways. <br />
<br />
Some classes, their core rotation remained intact .. Warrior has lots of cool buttons to press but .. it still feels aimless and disorganized. You can only hope your main is one of the ones that got mild, strange changes .. or got heavily simplified and not one of the ones who got totally destroyed.<br />
<br />
The best line I've seen is: &quot;Blizzard, you wanted to strengthen class identity but instead, you've destroyed it entirely.&quot;<br />
Pretty much sums it up, mostly. <br />
<br />
Let's see how the whole community reacts to something Alpha and Beta players have been overwhelmingly negative toward for months now.</div></div><hr />

They made the horrible mistake releasing the expansion in August. The other horrible mistake was wasting pre-expansion development on trying to separate PvP and PvE class skills. That should've been a post-release endeavor.<br />

Launch is going to be a disaster.</div></div><hr />

I guess you took the Doomsayer thing a bit too seriously</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no idea when the pre-patch is coming! Regardless I am looking forward to it.</div></div><hr />

It always said on preorder page at least one week of demon hunter access, so we could have had as long as they wanted.<br />

<br />
So instead of some people starting with the new zones and some people starting with the Demon Hunter first... everyone will create a Demon Hunter NOW and when the expansion is released, everyone will check out the new zones? ;)<br />
<br />
Does not sound like a fix to the bottleneck.</div></div><hr />
