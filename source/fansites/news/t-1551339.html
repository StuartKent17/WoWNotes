No, Fistweavers will use Crane Stance. <br />

They're the same spec but they'll use different stances now.<br />

<br />
It's actually probably not.<br />
<br />
1) All other store mounts can fly. <br />
-A. It's not as though this would be to make people okay with no flying. See: The flying <br />
CE mount, and the store mount based on the expansion being flying.<br />
2) The mount has unusual requirements, whereas the rest of the store mounts share the <br />
same requirements.<br />
-A. Requires Journeymen Riding, that's level 40.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and why is WW a multi target ability being made the rage dump for arms and slam being removed<br />
<br />
The whole tier got changed, they weren't trying to 'replace it with something similar'. And Slam got moved to that very tier. It looks like that tier will actually effect rotations/dps now, with an option for a less rotational effect(like the ones that replace Staggering Shout, which are an option for less button bloat for Arms).<br />
<br />

same requirements.<br />
-A. Requires Journeymen Riding, that's level 40.<br />
<br />
Also, it's not a completely new model, mostly a slightly updated corehound with a saddle, where as the majority of Store mounts are highly unique. So, a lot of reasons it's probably not a store mount :).</div></div><hr />

I was wondering whether they would update the skeletons models or not. Hope this is not just some undead npc (which would also be pretty cool).<br />
<br />
Besides, anyone else thinks that DK set would look amazing on warriors? They don't have any trade mark feature from DK sets apart from those tiny tiny skulls on the shoulders (I didn't even notice them the first time I saw the pictures). In the overall design, the look really &quot;gladiator&quot; style - make a generic one for warriors please!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And currently PVP blows because of all those as you say &quot;fun unique spells and CC's&quot;.. It is all the CCing that makes PVP a pain in the ass where you are pretty much CCed into the ground and this is what turns off most people from doing PVP..</div></div><hr />

That's what Blizzard are fixing, making PvP about trying to kill your opponent instead of trying to get out of CC. Your lame statement is going to be valid only for a couple of months more.<br />

It's only for 3 seconds, don't tell me you never stay stationary for 3 seconds in raid. Also they said like 9001 times that fights will not require people to run around all the time.</div></div><hr />

I've never seen it going so bad so quickly, not even during ghostcrawler's era.<br />
I never thought I'd say this but, with the way things are going now, I actually miss Ghostcrawler at this point. Even when I didn't agree with his decisions, I could at least understand his reasoning behind them. I can't say the same about whoever is running the show now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And there was much rejoicing! I logged on to the beta last night and saw that I had Rejuv and Moonfire, and you really have no idea how happy that made me. Now, if we could just get back a few more cat abilities, like maybe Rip...</div></div><hr />

One thing I really noticed on all specs was the lack of self-healing... guess I got too use to glyphed evocate healing.... It breaks up the levelling experience a lot compared to other classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. They are still removing far too many abilities for a game like wow. The game does not have weapon swap, it does not have dodging, blocking, or any dynamic like that; with such mechanics present you already have a baseline set of synergies with most abilities - but not in WoW.<br />
<br />
2. I feel for mages and self healing. :P If all mobs in the entire game was susceptible to their control abilities, then the mage food argument would hold. But we all know that's not the case (or anybody that played a mage anyway).</div></div><hr />

It requires at least level 40, possibly level 60 and doesn't fly so it's probably not a store mount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
God, it looks like the PvP in WoD will more or less be like PvE. Just stand blindly and DPS each other, with your set of DPS abilities. <br />
<br />
All those fun unique spells and CCs beyond the basic DPS spells, are the ones making PvP PvP. And they remove all of them.<br />
<br />
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight. Tell ya what, put some cash on the table and you stand in front me like you are saying once WoD comes out and we'll see who survives. Of course, I know you are just being emo ... but get a grip ... this was needed. Currently you spend more time cc'd and without any control of your character than you spend actually being able to play it.</div></div><hr />

Why on earth is whirlwind a single target rotation, are they trying to kill new warriors? I thought they wanted a better learning curve for new players? If you take whirlwind out of the &quot;already sad&quot; rotation, there is nothing left for large amounts of time. Then there are the problems with 5mans once they become Challenge Modes that will need CC unless changed. This is just broken atm.<br />

New transmog. If your toon is getting updated. They already said they will not have time to go back and fix all the older sets (the ones I like). :(</div></div><hr />

Ability Pruning<br />
Fel Flame has been removed.<br />
<br />
Movement Abilities<br />
After experimenting with the removal of Fel Flame in an earlier build, we brought the ability back, but reduced its effectiveness.<br />
Fel Flame now generates 5 Demonic Fury (down from 15), and only generates Burning Embers on critical strikes.<br />
<br />
Wait, what? Which is it? I still don't see it on the Beta.</div></div><hr />

Garrosh tells them how to build it, they use Gul'dan as an unwilling fel battery and BAM, <br />
instant Dark Portal. And there's no fel orcs so far. There're green ones and blue ones <br />
though.</div></div><hr />
