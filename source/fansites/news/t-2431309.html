As the patch 8.1.0 information starts to comes out, we wanted to share the current plans of what is being changed for Elemental Shaman.<br />
<br />
Core Ability Changes:<br />
<br />
Shifted some damage from Earth Shock to Lightning Bolt.<br />
<br />
Elemental Shaman is the only lightning based spell caster. However, over time, Lightning Bolt has gone from being a significant portion of your total damage to one of your least damaging abilities. It should be a powerful and effective spell for you to cast, and not something that feels like a burden to your rotation. Earth Shock will still be your hardest hitting spell, but Lightning Bolt should feel a bit better as part of your rotation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lava Burst has had its functionality changed behind the scenes to allow an in-flight Lava Burst to gain a guaranteed critical strike from a Flame Shock cast after the Lava Burst has been cast.<br />
<br />
This change should help your initial spells cast against a monster, boss, enemy player, or whatever else feel much better. You can cast Lava Burst before combat, and when it finishes, cast Flame Shock, and the Lava Burst will gain the critical strike benefit from your Flame Shock. <br />
<br />
<br />
Talent Changes:<br />
<br />
The level 15 talent Elemental Blast will now always pick a different secondary stat buff when causing an Elemental Overload. The level 30 talent Master of the Elements can now also benefit a Physical damage spell, allowing it to increase the damage of an Earthquake. The level 100 talent Stormkeeper now also increases the damage of your next two Lightning Bolts by 250% in addition to its existing effects. This damage bonus will also apply to the Elemental Overloads of Lightning Bolt from Stormkeeper.<br />
<br />
The Master of the Elements and Stormkeeper changes are primarily to help keep balance between single target damage and area damage of the talent rows. Master of the Elements will now affect your next Earthquake spell to keep the talent more competitive when dealing area damage, and Stormkeeper will grant you two really powerful Lightning Bolts that also cause Elemental Overloads when fighting just a single target.<br />
<br />
<br />
The level 15 talent Exposed Elements has been removed, and the level 90 talent Earthen Rage has taken its place The level 60 talent High Voltage has been removed. New talent in the level 60 row: Call the Thunder New talent in the level 90 row: Surge of Power<br />
<br />
<br />
When looking at the whole sum of changes made to Elemental Shaman this expansion, we feel that some of the passive talent choices weren’t holding up well, and had no interaction with how you played the game at all. We’re adding some experimental new talents that should allow some additional decision making on how you choose to use some of your abilities. Please keep in mind that both of these new talents, as well as all of the other changes, are still under iteration and may change entirely throughout the patch 8.1.0 PTR cycle.<br />
<br />
<br />
Account Wide Reputation Achievements<br />
Does this mean for example I'm halfway through honored with 7th legion on this toon. If I get on another alt and level through the 3 zones doing the questline that also give 7th legion rep that will count towards rep on this toon as well and I should be revered? Or vice versa all my alts should be halfway honored when they enter bfa?<br />
<br />
Rep gain won't be account wide, however progress towards the achievement will.<br />
<br />
Say for example I have Character A that I haven't touched since Wrath, that has all of the previous reps exalted (not using exact numbers here just making an example). Let's say we have 20 reputations at exalted on this character that are unique.<br />
<br />
Now I play Character B that I haven't touched those reps with, because I just don't want to grind them again. Let's say this character has 40 unique reputations that Character A doesn't have at exalted. Since its the highest progressed character the achievement only looks at this character. Meaning that I just have 40 reps as far as the achievement is concerned.<br />
<br />
Now once I've logged into both of those characters when this change is added into the game, I will then receive credit towards the achievement tracker and I would now show as having 60 reputations on that achievement. So I effectively don't have to go back and get those reps again, unless I want to make my Rep window look pretty.<br />
<br />
Any word on how it will treat faction exclusive reps?<br />
They will uniquely act as a singular rep to avoid double credit, similar with how mounts are tracked.<br />
<br />
So if you have exalted 7th Legion on your Alliance character, and exalted with Honorbound on your Horde. Then your account only has credit for 1 of those 2 reps in the achievement tracker. Account wise they're the same rep.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. It's saying that both 7th Legion and Honorbound only count as 1 exalted rep (no matter which one you have at exalted or if you have both) for the achievement tracker for &quot;X number of Exalted Reputations&quot; achievements.</div></div><hr />

If it's already broken surely there's nowhere to go but up? I'm optimistic and hoping these changes make live by the time I'm leveling my mag'har shaman. <br />

<br />
Yeah, should work like that. I remember in WoD I had the laughing skull achievement and after I faction changed that character it was converted to the sha'tari defense, so as long as those achievements are &quot;equivalent&quot; they swap if you do faction change.</div></div><hr />

Might want to read the blue post before raging... Reputations are not becoming account wide, it's the tracking of the achievement (earn x exalted reputations) that will now include other characters on the account (with the obvious restrictions/rules, similar to how mounts and pet tracking works).</div></div><hr />

Wow 2 where balance isn't complete dumpster but is still outclassed by many other classes. Add to that the rest of the raid bosses and every mythic dungeon and you've got a whole like 4% of boss fights that balance MAYBE competes on, and none that balance shines on.<br />
<br />
Warcraft logs don't lie, ele still parses higher on average.</div></div><hr />

there are no parses for mythrax &amp; g'huun mythic yet, this will make balance pass elemental overall not having your best fights parses missing doesn't paint the complete picture.<br />
<br />
so with even &quot;useless&quot; balance out parsing elemental, i think we can see why elemental is in such a bad state huh.<br />

Call the Thunder - Your maximum Maelstrom is increased by 30, and the Maelstrom cost of Earth Shock and Earthquake is reduced by 10.<br />
<br />
Surge of Power - Earth Shock also enhances your next spell:<br />
<br />
Flame Shock: The next cast does not incur a cooldown.<br />
Lightning Bolt: Your next 3 casts will cause an additional Elemental Overload.<br />
Lava Burst: Reduces the cooldown of your Fire (or Storm) Elemental by 6 sec.<br />
Frost Shock: Roots the target in place for 6 sec.</div></div><hr />

This. All of the others changes are perfect, but PLEASE remove this stupid non-sens of Flame Shock having a cooldown... I played all WoD and Legion and that's part of our rotation since...<br />
<br />
What is &quot;Immolation&quot; got a 6 seconds cooldown warlocks ?<br />
Or Moonfire and Sunfire maybe ?<br />

We just NEED that cooldown to be entierly REMOVED and all the fun will be restored.</div></div><hr />

No its not, but then the way they where hoping was stupid, your character gain rep by helping a fiction, if your start a new character it should not get exalted right away since that char never helped that faction, but they probably should put in a item you could buy or unlock at exalted that increased rep gain on other characters.</div></div><hr />

1.Blizzard to give every rep ingame the MOP treatment, if exalted you unlock 100% bonus rep for your alts<br />
2.The return of paragon chests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is nothing like that. Even if one of them is exalted, it doesn't really change anything for the other toon, except whats listed below.<br />
<br />
There is only a few targeted changes they are making:<br />
- You can collect exalted reps for the rep achievements on multiple characters<br />
- Champions of Azeroth unlocks will be account-wide (ie. if you are revered on one char, all of them get the +15 upgrades)<br />
- Rep requirements removed from faction-specific mog gear</div></div><hr />

You have account-wide achievements, but still, you can earn them on other toons (meaning: you always know that your new toon doesn't have all those achivs your main has), and still, guild panel (even the armory now) shows the character specific points, not the account.<br />
Rep now counts towards the achiv, but you still have to grind them if you want your alt to be somehow similiar to your long past main.<br />
Now, I know these are minor annoyances for almost all players, but still, it's so difficult to set up a system where my alts look exactly like my main (for mounts, achivs, pets, whatever)?</div></div><hr />

Just having them count in the sticker book doesn't really do anything.<br />
<br />
Also, without any comment on its power the name for Call the Thunder is dumb. Neither maelstrom nor Earthshock are lightning related so the name itself makes no sense.</div></div><hr />

But they are doing it?<br />
Reputation restricted transmog items will have restrictions removed.<br />
<br />
What is needed the reputation changes to be extended to all expansions.Being locked to BFA only is stupid.</div></div><hr />

I was hoping that if I'd gotten exalted with honorbound that it would unlock the 340 honorbound revered/exalted gear on my alts, but in retrospect I realize that was stupid and a pipe dream. <br />
<br />
The Champions of Azeroth rep thing is enough in that it will let me progress with my necklace without grinding on every character. And from what I understand, all the flight paths I unlocked on the opposite faction's island will be already there for all my existing characters too (was already a mechanic in the game), so that's good.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">splatomat</div><div class="date">2018-09-19, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I suspected &quot;reputation is now account-wide&quot; was too good to be true just on its face. Having all reps on all characters contribute to the achievement is okay, but not really what I recall anybody was asking for. There's tons of things that just should be BOA by this point, but aren't for some reason, which is a continual irritation.<br />
<br />
Champions of Azeroth change is good, though they sorta painted themselves into that corner. If you don't want people getting angry about repetitive grinds for alts, don't make a system that requires repetitive grinds for alts.</div></div><hr />

Apart from the QoL FS+LvB interaction, other changes do not fix the underlying issues the spec has.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Make EB and Echo baseline<br />
<br />
Make Stormkeeper baseline and 3charges<br />
<br />
Integrate legion gloves to baseline ascendance<br />
<br />
Bring back Gust of wind<br />
<br />
Make a talent for 1-2 free lava surges when you move<br />
<br />
Bring back Lightning Conduit<br />
<br />
Remove FS cd<br />
<br />
Make baseline spell cast lower. to 1.5-1.6sec, otherwise every expancion eles will be dragged back to being shit<br />
<br />
Lower Astral shit CD so we can actually survive something.<br />
<br />
If Ion says shamans are not a mobile spec give us something to survive. Like baseline avoidance.<br />
<br />
If we suffer greatly on movement our staionary dps should be much higher.<br />
<br />
If you want Lightning bolt to feel powerfull change it's animation to Crash Lightning\Lightning conduit proc and reverse the animation of &quot;CastStrongUpRight&quot; and &quot;CastStrongUpLeft&quot; so the shaman reaches for the sky and pulls a bolt down. Like https://www.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Ro0k0zJ89caR9Mo9m8tpq808tpd87ctps87VvYh808tpa808tpk808tpb808K1h8zcE8Cuz87c<br />
<br />
Earth Shock animation should have an upgrade. For a main nuke the little durt thud looks ridiculous</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know what else says hi? Affliction. One of the top dps specs in the game.<br />
<br />
Demo might have problems, but at least warlocks have viable dps specs to use until it gets fixed.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
there are no parses for mythrax &amp; g'huun mythic yet, this will make balance pass elemental overall not having your best fights parses missing doesn't paint the complete picture.<br />
<br />
so with even &quot;useless&quot; balance out parsing elemental, i think we can see why elemental is in such a bad state huh.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
clueless devs, utterly clueless they're trying to offer it back with surge of power, but it's bullshit it NEEDS to be baseline, any other answer is pure stupidity and ignorance from the clowns at blizzard.<br />
<br />
Even if balance parses okay on Mythrax/G'huun that doesn't suddenly make it good. Parsing good in 2 fights out of a hundred isn't balance; and guilds are still taking twice as many affliction warlocks as balance for those fights.</div></div><hr />

2 fights out of 100? what tier you doing? this tier has 8 bosses nice try, thats 25%.</div></div><hr />

I'm including all the mythic+ dungeon fights where balance is completely useless; raid content isn't the only PvE content in the game, and it isn't the only content that matters either.<br />
<br />
But you got me, its probably closer to like 60 fights or something; and that's if you only count boss fights and don't include the fact that mythic+ trash is actually pretty tough and balance aoe is garbage unless they completely destroy their already bad single target to buff it.</div></div><hr />

lmao counting every single m+ boss, this pathetic attempt to grasp at straws.<br />
<br />
last xpac 2 ele's were in the MDI, while something like 70 balance druids were there, balance was amazing and elemental was shit.<br />
<br />
now both are shit, soooo balance still winning.<br />
<br />
face it no matter how garbage you try make balance look, elemental fails to make the same impact.<br />
<br />
suck it up buttercup you can easily be shit for another 2 expansions before you have the same rights to complain as elemental.<br />
<br />
now quit whining about balance druids or it's to the ignore list with you.</div></div><hr />

And I don't play Shaman, but that's not an excuse.<br />
Except the shaman (and every other class in the game) has gone through varying levels of revisions from expansion to expansion. Their gameplay and mechanics did not remain static. They always changed, and, as such, need refinement and improvements with each expansion.</div></div><hr />

I see that you are 12, so feel free to &quot;put me on the ignore list&quot; &gt;.&gt; I mained elemental for the last 3 expansions and it was always in a better place than balance feels right now. Its not a perfect spec, but it at least felt impactful.<br />
<br />
Brushing aside mythic+ content as if it doesn't matter for balance just shows you aren't considering everything.</div></div><hr />
