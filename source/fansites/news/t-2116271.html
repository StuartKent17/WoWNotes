Class Design on the 7.1.5 PTR<br />
We’re making some significant changes to many specializations in Patch 7.1.5, and this has understandably resulted in some concern and confusion, particularly from players who may be less familiar with our PTR and development processes. So, we’d like to take a moment to explain what’s going on and how it pertains to what you’re seeing (or haven’t yet seen) on the PTR.<br />
<br />
First, it’s important to understand the role that the PTR plays in our overall development process. At this stage, Patch 7.1.5 is still a work in progress. The PTR is only a snapshot of where we happened to be in development at the time the build was created. There are a lot of people working on WoW, and a lot of projects in various stages of completion. As a result, especially at this early stage of the PTR cycle, you’re going to see a lot of incomplete or unfinished work. Quite often, when something you see doesn’t make sense, it’s simply because we hadn’t finished making it make sense before the latest build was created.<br />
<br />
Looking specifically at class design, the changes you’re seeing so far are focused primarily on how each spec plays in terms of mechanics, rotations, ability sets, talent options, etc. As some of these changes are fairly significant, we haven’t been making many adjustments to overall performance just yet. We need each spec to be completely functional before we can start tuning its effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Right now, the build currently live on the 7.1.5 PTR is only about halfway through those mechanical changes. We’ve been continuing to work hard on getting those finished, and the next build should give you a clearer picture of what’s happening with your spec. We’ll try to share as much insight as we can into what we’re doing at that point.<br />
<br />

Artifact Power Exploit Actions<br />
Players that exploited the world quests to gain excessive Artifact Power will lose that Artifact Power.<br />

Patch 7.1.5 PTR - Artifact Knowledge Catch Up<br />
Patch 7.1.5 allows you to complete Knowledge is Power (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/46147-knowledge-is-power) to convert 500 x Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources) into Artifact Research Synopsis (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/144395-artifact-research-synopsis).<br />
In the upcoming Patch 7.1.5 (currently on the PTR for testing), you will be able to purchase ranks of Artifact Knowledge instantly for Order Resources up until a certain rank, at which point you'll have to continue with researching Artifact Knowledge as normal.<br />
<br />
As things currently are, if you're only just starting out at 110 right now, the amount of time needed to research the lower ranks of Artifact Knowledge is already a lot shorter than the 5 days needed to research ranks at the opposite end of the spectrum.<br />

Legendary Item Luck<br />
Hey all,<br />
<br />
I'd just like to clear up a common misconception I've seen come up a lot in of recent discussions regarding Legendaries.<br />
<br />
In short:<br />
<br />
Your total time /played and average item level has no bearing on your chances of obtaining a Legendary.<br />
<br />
To be a little more specific:<br />
<br />
Player A and Player B could both have exactly 10 days of /played at level 110 and neither of them have a Legendary yet.<br />
<br />
Player A has spent most of that time idling in Dalaran or their Order Hall, simply kicking it by the water cooler in guild chat or trade chat. Beyond doing their daily Emissary Cache and a Mythic Dungeon here or there, they don't really do that much in the way of Legendary-eligible content. Now, Player A could get very lucky with their next Emissary Cache and get a Legendary, but they'd be a statistical outlier in this scenario.<br />
<br />
Player B, on the other hand, has spent the majority of their time doing Legendary-eligible content. They do their daily Emissary Cache, clear Emerald Nightmare each week, do a Random Legion Heroic Dungeon regularly and participate in a lot of Mythic/Mythic Keystone dungeon runs to help out their friends etc.<br />
<br />
At this point in time Player B's chance of getting a Legendary will be much higher than that of Player A. As Player B has participated in far more Legendary-eligible content, their bad luck protection will be ramping up and increasing their chances of a getting a Legendary from their next run of Legendary-eligible content. Hence the saying &quot;if you do the content, the Legendaries will come.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then player A gets BiS legendaries, while Player B gets the !@#$ tier legendaries that are totally useless. Fast forward some time, Player A and Player B both try to get the same spot in a raid. Of course, player A gets picked because he has better legendaries that actually increase his performance.<br />
Well in this scenario as Player B has been helping their guild out more than Player A has, I think most communal focused guilds would prefer to give the spot to someone like Player B who is actually contributing to helping the guild, rather than the person who got lucky and is simply there for the ride.<br />
<br />
Also as Player B has spent more time doing current content than Player A, they will arguably know how to adapt and adjust to situations (like where they can squeeze out more DPS for example) more readily than Player A will.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of groups and guilds clearing Normal and Heroic Emerald Nightmare &amp; Trial of Valor with most of their roster not even having a BiS Legendary. A Legendary should not going to be the sole determining factor in whether or not a coordinated group is going to beat an encounter. Sure, the Legendary might bring enhancements or utility that may make the process smoother, but they're not a through-and-through substitute for skill and execution.<br />
<br />
Only, many of us are doing the content but still aren't getting any or just getting bad once that we'll never use.<br />
<br />
The system is still the worst idea you ever had and it's completely ruining the experience the game is supposed to deliver. It's no longer fun! Playing the game is NOT fun. Do you not see this?<br />
<br />
The legendary system at it's best provides a sense of relief if you manage to get two good ones but at it's worst it just makes you furstrated, angryand disapointed.<br />
<br />
That is NOT a good system. Let us target the items that are quickly becoming mandatory (if they aren't already) like you said would be possible.<br />
<br />
That small change would make the expantion way better in every way. As it stands now, Legion is by far the worst expantion to date simply becuase of this legendary system.<br />
<br />
How do you not see this Blizzard? Why aren't you listening to feedback?<br />
We are listening to, and reading, the feedback and we're regularly forwarding the feedback on. If/when I receive any thoughts or information I can share in regards to feedback received, then I will share it with you as I always have. Not having an answer does not mean you are not being listened too.

They have many different teams doing checkins to a massive code base. heck it's also often why sometimes a new build deploys and guess what it doesn't work on windows 32 or mac or something. Conflicting code changes. 7.1 had a ptr build that didn't work on mac for a week because bnet pushed some bnet changes that weren't compatible without mac code fixes from an entirely diff team. That's just nature of diff teams working on different projects that sync their code into these builds. If they wait for them to be synced all the time though they wouldn't ever deploy any test builds, just release!. So they just deploy them as is but deploy often as they need to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do know what PTR stands for don't you? It stands for Public Test Realm, you see the word &quot;Test&quot; that is there to test various parts of a new upcoming patch for any problems and why there are various builds of said new patch before release.<br />
<br />
And even if they did release a half done PTR patch it does give them valuable feedback from those on the PTR on what is wrong and to fix it, that is why they have a PTR in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Yup the comments scream of damage control.<br />

If they were really just concerns with mechanics/rotation there wouldn't have been any numbers tuning yet. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the guys that capture and push the builds aren't the same guys as the people developing. The patch still needs tested for bugs, not just tuning. As such there is alot to gain on blizzards side by pushing parts of features that are finished so that bugs can be found earlier and fixed faster. <br />
<br />
Remember the PTR is just like beta, it's there for much more than just for us to test out class changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't that what the PTR is for? Testing unfinished builds? ;)<br />
<br />
On a serious note; I get what you're trying to say, but actually this is pretty common for development builds, not just with Blizzard, you just don't get to see the development builds of many game/software companies. Builds are put out with various changes being at various levels of polish, as feedback can be provided for the finished components and even feedback on unfinished changes can provide good insight as it gives people more time to find problems, and gives the company statistics to base further changes on.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ildon</div><div class="date">2016-11-19, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why push out a half finished build for PTR then, especially if the mechanical changes don't make sense?

<br />
This is just how software development works. If the build compiles, you send it to quality assurance (which is what the PTR is) to test that the changes implemented so far work. There are some changes that are dependent on other changes already working. You have to find out if the first set of changes worked before wasting time on the next set of changes. On top of that, a lot of changes that are just part of a bigger overall picture might be done and there's no reason not to test that those already work.<br />
<br />
So you might ask &quot;Why don't they have patch notes that list the intended changes so people know what the plan is?&quot; The reason is that if they post those changes, even if they put a bunch of caveats that they're incomplete, they're going to get posted all over various WoW news sites and message boards and a lot of people are going to take them as finalized. Even after they update the patch notes, people will have seen and remembered the discarded changes and think that's what's coming and get upset about it. When they just say nothing, they can be like &quot;Well gee, I guess those datamined changes weren't official.&quot;<br />
<br />
To make matters even more complicated, again, because of the way software development works, the changes we see on the PTR can often be a week or two old versus what their current internal version or their current plans are. Why bother making patch notes for changes that you already know you've discarded internally? Why try to explain the reasoning behind a change that you've already given up on?<br />
<br />
When it comes to communicating changes possible future changes that might not make it to live, they're basically in a no-win situation. And this isn't speculation, this is what has actually happened in the past when they've taken different approaches to PTRs and patch notes.<br />
<br />
My guess on how the life cycle of a class change works:<br />
1. Identify a problem with a spec. <br />
2. Come up with solutions to the problem.<br />
3. Do some math to make sure the solutions actually solve the problem. Possibly do some rough prototyping on your personal workstation.<br />
4. Schedule a meeting to discuss the solutions and get people's opinions and approval for the change.<br />
5. Implement the change.<br />
6. Commit local changes to code repository.<br />
7. Make sure it actually works along with whatever other changes have occurred since you last checked out the code.<br />
8. Code review to make sure you didn't make a silly mistake.<br />
9. Merge to Master and compile.<br />
10. Compiled changes go through automated testing process to make sure you didn't break the build.<br />
11. Internal quality assurance checks your changes and confirms they're working.<br />
12. Internal QA moves the new build with all changes in the past week (or couple days or whatever) to PTR for external testing.<br />
<br />
And a &quot;change&quot; can literally be &quot;modifying exactly one spell.&quot; Changing a class's rotation typically requires changing multiple spells and talents and buffs. The person assigned to change those spells might have 10 changes to make, and the part where they move the build to the PTR might happen when only changes 1-7 are complete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Already the comment about two players playing for 10 days and not seeing a legendary means nothing because a player playing within 24-hours of getting mythic+ boosted by guildies can soak up legendaries.<br />
<br />
Even dismissing guild carries, there are people doing LFD &quot;casually&quot; and raking in legendaries.<br />
<br />
Their system doesn't work. It's just a carrot on the stick to keep people who aren't lucky playing.</div></div><hr />

eh, most of the people complaining are hilariously out of perspective. legendaries used to be gated behind the hardest content and really long investments of time. now they can drop from dungeons. pretty soon people will be pissed if blizz doesn't mail them them their gear every month.<br />

if people are getting this upset over their bad luck, maybe they should take a break and go outside once or twice instead of screaming at their computer screens.</div></div><hr />

You're not insightful enough to realize that this isn't the same team working on the game as Vanilla-BC-WotlK.<br />
<br />
This is equivalent to boss telling their customers to &quot;fuck off&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you want to ride on the &quot;parent&quot; fallacy, the current dev team are step parents insulting a kid that their real parents &quot;left because they didn't love them&quot; and that they should &quot;get over it&quot;. Unfortunately you can't call child protective services on &quot;bad devs&quot;.<br />

I am not a big fan of how you obtain legendaries myself, but for completely different reasons. As for what he is talking about? if you take three seconds to think about it, you will realize that it's not entirely a new fucking concept. It is just a low percentage drop. Period. <br />
Legion isn't the first expansions to have them. One could almost say that low percentage drops have been there since start of the game. Why does their presence make this the worst expansion all of the sudden? Probably because he didn't get the one he wanted so he is upset now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I read this correctly then it means several teams are working, for example, on feral druid changes? Like, one team is working on talents and other team on abilities, and third team on number tuning? If this is not the case and one team is focusing on feral talents and abilities, then why dont we get it all at once? <br />
<br />
Because...if there are several teams working on each spec in the game, not just a single team really fixing glaring issues with some specs, then no wonder some classes are all over the place...it all makes sense now. If this assumption is wrong then in second half of 7.1.5 PTR we will get only numbers tuning...which would be sad.</div></div><hr />

A fire mage without the bracer will do about 54k less than a mage with a bracer everything else being equal. The example also went completely against their philosophy that a spec should be intuitive. The player won't be likely to mess up if it's actually intuitive. <br />
<br />
This is kinda like you are one of two people apply for a job and the only reason you're offering up that the employer should hire you is that the other guy may be bad. Hello people, please wake up. This was how Trump won the presidency. People who backed Hilary could only say that Trump was worse than her and they offered no solid argument as to why she would be a good choice. Are the devs in this game actually retarded???</div></div><hr />

You would have to farm for several month just to get to the bottom level of current raiders. That's a really bad system.</div></div><hr />

Let me remind you that you had months of alpha/beta and you still released warlock as the worst class. It took you more than EN release to fix warlock which was an unplayable class.<br />
<br />
Even now warlocks are still in the toilet, and prolly the only class that needs at least 2 different specs in order to perform in PVE.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">solidbear</div><div class="date">2016-11-19, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are plenty of groups and guilds clearing Normal and Heroic Emerald Nightmare &amp; Trial of Valor with most of their roster not even having a BiS Legendary. A Legendary should not going to be the sole determining factor in whether or not a coordinated group is going to beat an encounter. Sure, the Legendary might bring enhancements or utility that may make the process smoother, but they're not a through-and-through substitute for skill and execution.<br />
<br />
Legendaries don't mean squat in normal/heroic since that content isn't really what people are talking about. <br />
<br />
We're talking about Mythics, where this stuff actually matters (and makes a significant difference). We're talking about 2 players, on equal capabilities, except Player A has BiS legendaries, while Player B had bad luck and got stuck with Seph's &amp; Pyrdaz<br />
<br />
Player A and B are both rogues in a melee heavy expansion. Both players are in top guilds and their skills are equal, their time spent doing legendary eligible content equal. Their RNG, however, is not equal. <br />
<br />
Raid Leader has to decide raid comp for Raid boss A which has mechanics that punish you for being melee heavy in an expansion that released yet another melee class. Raid Leader is deciding on Player A and B, but Player A always has a bit higher numbers thanks to RNG/luck/BiS legendaries. Player B is sat for progression and a kill. <br />
<br />
Does Blizzard not see the problems here? We're talking about Mythic raiders who can't even compete on the same level because of RNG. Get stuck with bad legendaries? Sorry. Good luck trying to rank against those who got lucky with their BiS legendaries.<br />
<br />

Considering the kind of feedback they're getting, I'm not very surprised that the legendary system has changed very little since release.<br />
Maybe people could try coming up with some substantial argument instead of &quot;IN THE LAND OF 2 PEOPLE OF SAME CLASS, SPEC, EQUAL GEAR, SKILL, AND SOCIAL STANDING, ROSTER SIZE ETC, ONE GETTING BENCHED DUE TO A SINGLE ITEM THEREFORE LEGENDARYS ARE RUINING THIS GAME&quot;<br />

<br />
The legendary system is working out great overall, and the complaints feel like 95% saltiness because someones newly dinged guildy got his specs BiS in his first heroic. <br />
Oh, but then we (eventually?) get this &quot;certain legendary targetting&quot; and people will bitch and moan about the time required to &quot;pick up my legendaries&quot; because you took chance and randomness out of the equation.<br />

Because wether you like or not mythic raiding people are a small fraction of the WoW player base. Yes you guys are among the most vocal players but still a very tiny fraction compared to the whole. They will never ever balance/design the game with only this fraction of their audience in mind. From their data the legendary system must be a positive for the vast majority or it wouldn't make sense.<br />

I completely agree it sucks for the hardcore mythic people but for the vast majority of the player base it is not a make or break thing.<br />

<br />
First of all, what kind of idiot can wrote that &quot;The system is still the worst idea you ever had and it's completely ruining the experience the game is supposed to deliver. It's no longer fun! Playing the game is NOT fun. Do you not see this?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Are you kidding me ? Literally the game should be based on hardcore playing not on the freetime activity. If you want to chill in this game, surely you won't be good at this ever. If you kind of person who likes to spend his time playing game just to chill or to have fun go play solitaire,mines or if you are creative and you want to more than just clicking with one hand go play Stronghold Crusader or Rome Total War or if you are really good at games HoS/Dota/LoL. Those are nice games I admit I played them a lot BUT stop this depretiating of this amazing game. <br />
<br />
Surely if you want to be good you need to play for days, months, years to be one of the elite players and have bis items. You actually should spend your time watching videos for new tactics, reading forums for advices of gear setup and theorycrafting, reading websites such as MMO-champions to be in touch with upcoming content, buy ticket for Blizzcon and go there and have a good time. BUT some people are lazy as fuck, literally they just want to get legendaries + bis items in few weeks. Come on guys ? Are you that dumb ? <br />
<br />
If I am raidleader I won't invite you because you are 885 ilvl and you have bis legendaries :D I will firstly check your logs, then check your armory, then ask ppl if they know you, or you should be in my friendlist if I had already possitive experience from playing with you. <br />
<br />
Surely I admit that it might be bad for hardcore players not to have bis legendaries BUT I don't have one and I still pull as much healing as best healers in the world. Start thinking guys if you will cry like this all the time Blizz will make game easier and easier and in the end what we will hear once again ? &quot;The game is too easy... &quot; or &quot; We want some challenge, Blizz come on give us some ... &quot; Stop crying and focus more on playing. Moreover I would give an example we have seen now : Helya HC. Sure it was a bit harder than it should, but at least it has shown how many guilds are just bunch of idiots. Gratz to those who are thinking during fights and know how to not fail to the same thing 2 times in row. :)<br />
<br />
My personal advice: More hardcore playing less crying or YOU will make it worse.<br />

Please compare the logs of person with 1 sht legendary and casual who had luck with 2 bis ones mr raid leader. Some ppl played 3-4 times as much as some of those u described as casual and still have 1 bad legendary or 2 bad ones to even race for top dps on warcraftlogs. Do ur rotations perfect, be pro all u want but ul still lose dps race with 1 shit legendary against someone who has 2 bis ones. And no u wont invite someone with 1 sht legendary over someone with 2 bis ones despite how pro he is (aside if u know the person).</div></div><hr />

I admit that those legendaries are a bit overboosted, but in this case you are forgetting one important thing and thats guild community. In guild it doesnt matter you dont have legendary, you can be 880 ilvl without legendary also if you are lucky and appropriate gear will drop you can at least reach those with bis legendaries. If you are playing in guild for long time you should be raider then and you dont need to worry about your raid spot, but mostly people who started to play this game are crying about this problem. Do you think also people in Method have all bis legendaries ? And tell me now are they not able to kill all end bosses or are they arguing about legendaries stuff ? They still perform brilliant even without those legendaries.<br />
<br />
It's just those lazy ppl qqing around that they don't have spots in myth+ or in raids. Are you not able to find suitable community to play with ?<br />
<br />
To add one thing so you might lower your tone: I have 2 worst legendaries even after next small patch changes those will be worst and I am not crying about it or spamming blizzard why is it like that. I am 7/7 m EN 2/3 ToV HC 3% wipe on Helya with play time 40 days at the moment with over 1k myth + dungeons done. Why ? Because I have community to play with and I perform good.</div></div><hr />

Problem is WoW players aren't lab rats. We don't have to keep pulling the lever forever in the hopes of a random prize.<br />

And of course if you're in the competitive Mythic world, and you're outplaying someone with BiS legendaries, the obvious question is how in the hell did that mouthbreather get in your guild in the first place?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're talking about Mythics, where this stuff actually matters (and makes a significant difference). We're talking about 2 players, on equal capabilities, except Player A has BiS legendaries, while Player B had bad luck and got stuck with Seph's &amp; Pyrdaz<br />
<br />
Player A and B are both rogues in a melee heavy expansion. Both players are in top guilds and their skills are equal, their time spent doing legendary eligible content equal. Their RNG, however, is not equal. <br />
<br />
Raid Leader has to decide raid comp for Raid boss A which has mechanics that punish you for being melee heavy in an expansion that released yet another melee class. Raid Leader is deciding on Player A and B, but Player A always has a bit higher numbers thanks to RNG/luck/BiS legendaries. Player B is sat for progression and a kill. <br />
<br />
Does Blizzard not see the problems here? We're talking about Mythic raiders who can't even compete on the same level because of RNG. Get stuck with bad legendaries? Sorry. Good luck trying to rank against those who got lucky with their BiS legendaries.<br />
<br />
Hazzikostas has to know of the woes of Mythic Raiders. He's the GM of EJ for goodness sakes. They have to know this system is really crappy.<br />
<br />
It's a good argument, but the problem is mythic raiders make up less than 1% of the player base. So they probably not going to see it has a real problem.</div></div><hr />

They also alter your playstyle depending on what you get - and do actually offer a substantial reward for gameplay.<br />
<br />
The big problem with them is that, for most classes - there are 2 which greatly enhance your specc - pushing it 10-20% over anyone who doesnt have them, and the rest of them have defensive stats.<br />
DPS usually isnt invited based on their survivability - they are invited for DPS. You dont invite a warlock because he has better defenses than a mage for instance. That makes all defensive ones absoulte garbage compared to the DPS ones.<br />
Then theres also the fact that some of them have garbage stats on them. The neck for retribution/ shadow is a good example for an item you just cant equip.<br />
<br />
A good system would be that all DPS legendaries enhance your dps by 10-15% in some form or another, or none of them do and only grant you utility. You should also be able to reforge (only legendaries) one of the stats to your mainstat. Sure, some would be better than others - but you would never feel screwed by the game for not recieving one of the best ones.</div></div><hr />

And even if they did release a half done PTR patch it does give them valuable feedback from those on the PTR on what is wrong and to fix it, that is why they have a PTR in the first place.<br />

I get where and other people quoting me are coming from, but especially with these mechanic changes, it's hard to judge how certain stuff works if the other half is still missing.

Firstly, I didn't say I didn't care. Secondly, I *certainly* didn't say there was no iteration of design where I *wouldn't* care.<br />

I am quite happy with the knowledge that a legendary will come to me eventually. I find this to be satisfying and I am happy to be patient.

No, that would be one of the bad ones for sure. Fire mages have one that sure is game changeing. DKs and rogues have these as well.<br />

You don't need them for normal but you'd never take a player without them over someone that has them if they were just as good.<br />

You might very well go without a usable one all expantion long though and theres the problem. No matter how much you play or how good you are theres no guarantee you'll get a legendary.<br />
<br />
For many players, not having one now means they simply can't take part in the in the content they used to in previous expantions where RNG was not the deciding factor. You either get lucky or you don't play the game.<br />
<br />
WoW used to be about skill and dedication, now it's just a lottery. Thats not what I'd call fun.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zoldor</div><div class="date">2016-11-19, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the legendary system is not good for an MMO. Totally random drops, being important, and being ultra powerful is a bad way to handle it. Yes, in vanilla it could take a while to get BiS, but that has more to do with 40 man raid teams, small drops per boss, etc. It wasn't a totally random system. You could target your loots, save your DKP, and acquire what you wanted based on a time-effort-reward system. This random system needs to stay where it came from, dungeon crawlers and hack in slash.<br />
<br />
An MMO is more about work for reward than the random shiny from random content. I don't like it as a model in an MMO. Even if I had BiS i'd feel this way, because I like the idea of working toward something, not just randomly waiting on something that could come from any random thing. Especially, when class design is considered around these items or influenced by them. You want a random system, make the reward utility based and not class performance based. <br />
<br />
The system has way too much influence on the game and the reward to effort just isn't there. It is a Bad design I think needs to be gone in the next expansion or revamped.<br />
<br />
I do not think this makes Legion bad, as I've greatly enjoyed Legion. This part of it is something I dislike and think is the weakest point of the entire expansion. No expansion is perfect and some things have to change going forward and I hope this is one of them.<br />
<br />
It oddly keeps me from playing my alts as well, as I keep thinking. One more Mythic, one more Heroic, one more + and maybe I'll land that good Legendary. Despite not really wanting to do the content. There isn't a sense of completion.</div></div><hr />

What are we supposed to test in such a case, how broken shit is? This whole thing sounds like a backpedal to me because of the outrage since the release of this first PTR iteration.<br />
<br />
Because they're testing more than just talents, obviously. The art/landscape guys may have stuff that was ready to look at, so they put it up. This is a HUGE patch, so of course other teams than class design are going to be using it. <br />
<br />
This PTR I would bet is going to be up until January. You have plenty of time to test the changes, when they finish them. They don't owe you anything, so stop acting like they do - the PTR is a priviledge, not a right.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Yup the comments scream of damage control.<br />
<br />
&quot;The changes you’re seeing so far are focused primarily on how each spec plays in terms of mechanics, rotations, ability sets, talent options, etc. As some of these changes are fairly significant, we haven’t been making many adjustments to overall performance just yet. We need each spec to be completely functional before we can start tuning its effectiveness.&quot;<br />
<br />
If they were really just concerns with mechanics/rotation there wouldn't have been any numbers tuning yet. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
They're all over the board with this expansion. Sting's complaiing aside, it seems like they're rebuilding all the specializations...but didnt they say last week, they were just going to tweak and buff, not large changes? <br />
<br />
The instability of the class design is...surprising. I'm glad I'm not playing, is looks like everyone gets to relearn their class every patch. That's not good for the long term.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tykus</div><div class="date">2016-11-19, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then player A gets BiS legendaries, while Player B gets the !@#$ tier legendaries that are totally useless. Fast forward some time, Player A and Player B both try to get the same spot in a raid. Of course, player A gets picked because he has better legendaries that actually increase his performance.<br />
Well in this scenario as Player B has been helping their guild out more than Player A has, I think most communal focused guilds would prefer to give the spot to someone like Player B who is actually contributing to helping the guild, rather than the person who got lucky and is simply there for the ride.<br />
<br />
Also as Player B has spent more time doing current content than Player A, they will arguably know how to adapt and adjust to situations (like where they can squeeze out more DPS for example) more readily than Player A will.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of groups and guilds clearing Normal and Heroic Emerald Nightmare &amp; Trial of Valor with most of their roster not even having a BiS Legendary. A Legendary should not going to be the sole determining factor in whether or not a coordinated group is going to beat an encounter. Sure, the Legendary might bring enhancements or utility that may make the process smoother, but they're not a through-and-through substitute for skill and execution.<br />

<br />
i really dislike the &quot;u can clear content without bis legendary speech&quot; , this is seriously dumb, getting outperformed by someone because they are lucky and you are not. This doesn't leave a good taste in every single players mouth, the players with good legendaries also knew they didnt beat ppl fair n square , they just got lucky with drops.<br />
<br />
class balancing isnt the only ball they dropped, the current legendary system is also a mess, exactly like what the questions pointed out , get lucky twice and u are done for the rest of the xpac while everyone else struggles in frustration without any solution in sight. Just allow us to trade 2 legendaries for a targeted one , reward ppl that farmed hard since the beginning of legion until now and hasnt been rewarded for their effort n hardwork and also hasnt even get lucky with drops, ie, 99% of the player base and me.<br />
<br />
Also f**k sephuz prydaz n other rubbish legendaries that has absolutely rubbish bonus and unusable, these legendaries shouldnt even exist cause they only make players sad.<br />

what surprises me is why the f... they try again and again so hard to go away from that model - like with vp - taking it away was hated by playerbase - bringing it back revitalised WoD and was one of better parts of that expansion - i bet that if they brough in vp gear back and cap it at 870 itlv people would be more then happy to farm it . yet they try and try to find stupid solutions to non existent problems. <br />

Though as far as people demanding 'good' legendaries for your group privilege, I can't say I've seen that in the pugs I've been in. Ilvls definitely help, but unless you're doing bottom-level DPS compared to the group average, then you'll do fine. Just play your character and gear where you can.

Even Blizzard knows it's bad, I mean they didn't even want to talk about Legendaries at Blizzcon. It's like they were ashamed.<br />
<br />
Playing a suboptimal spec with poor gear might work in LFR, you have fun there while &quot;standing up for yourself&quot;. That part of the game does not intrest me however.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warg0n</div><div class="date">2016-11-20, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all,<br />
<br />
I'd just like to clear up a common misconception I've seen come up a lot in of recent discussions regarding Legendaries.<br />
<br />
In short:<br />
<br />
Your total time /played and average item level has no bearing on your chances of obtaining a Legendary.<br />
<br />
To be a little more specific:<br />
<br />
Player A and Player B could both have exactly 10 days of /played at level 110 and neither of them have a Legendary yet.<br />
<br />
Player A has spent most of that time idling in Dalaran or their Order Hall, simply kicking it by the water cooler in guild chat or trade chat. Beyond doing their daily Emissary Cache and a Mythic Dungeon here or there, they don't really do that much in the way of Legendary-eligible content. Now, Player A could get very lucky with their next Emissary Cache and get a Legendary, but they'd be a statistical outlier in this scenario.<br />
<br />
Player B, on the other hand, has spent the majority of their time doing Legendary-eligible content. They do their daily Emissary Cache, clear Emerald Nightmare each week, do a Random Legion Heroic Dungeon regularly and participate in a lot of Mythic/Mythic Keystone dungeon runs to help out their friends etc.<br />
<br />
At this point in time Player B's chance of getting a Legendary will be much higher than that of Player A. As Player B has participated in far more Legendary-eligible content, their bad luck protection will be ramping up and increasing their chances of a getting a Legendary from their next run of Legendary-eligible content. Hence the saying &quot;if you do the content, the Legendaries will come.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Somewhat disagree. Been doing content from the start. 2500 Rep from being Exalted with all factions. Finally 2 days ago got my first legenday. Player A as you describe it has 2 by doing nothing but a few Mythics soooo. Also other player A's in the guild doing nothing but heroics and LFR and have a legendary. Happy I finally got 1 but kind of not accurate.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Camodo</div><div class="date">2016-11-20, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder how many times in the history of this game, the decision on whom to bench has come down to a single item or metric.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Considering the kind of feedback they're getting, I'm not very surprised that the legendary system has changed very little since release.<br />
Maybe people could try coming up with some substantial argument instead of &quot;IN THE LAND OF 2 PEOPLE OF SAME CLASS, SPEC, EQUAL GEAR, SKILL, AND SOCIAL STANDING, ROSTER SIZE ETC, ONE GETTING BENCHED DUE TO A SINGLE ITEM THEREFORE LEGENDARYS ARE RUINING THIS GAME&quot;<br />
<br />
There has ALWAYS, and ALWAYS WILL BE, some metric these people will cry about in these pathetic &quot;ALL THINGS EQUAL BUT X&quot;. It has been professions, certain trinkets, certain specs, certain talents, certain pure luck world drop, pure gearscore, classes (&quot;tanks, healers, ranged, melee&quot;), it has been down to racials, or I shit you not I've seen someone complaining about fucking server latency because he had a much higher ms and thus &quot;performed worse than my guildy&quot;<br />
<br />
The legendary system is working out great overall, and the complaints feel like 95% saltiness because someones newly dinged guildy got his specs BiS in his first heroic. <br />
Oh, but then we (eventually?) get this &quot;certain legendary targetting&quot; and people will bitch and moan about the time required to &quot;pick up my legendaries&quot; because you took chance and randomness out of the equation.<br />
<br />
The analogy earlier in the thread of Blizzard being the driver and vocal community being the advising toddler in the back feels more appropriate than ever.<br />
<br />
I don't really care much for the legendary system..seems a bit silly that something that you spend time and effort to get in the past now is a random drop tho...the &quot;player a got lucky and player b got aids&quot; discussion is entertaining a big part of the way .<br />
<br />
I'm more mad about the ignorance from blizzards side....they have been wrong countless times without ever been willing to admidt so..<br />
<br />
They had so much good information about numbers and bad game mechanic's from the Hunter and shaman player base in alpha/beta and still they ignored pretty much all of them <br />
<br />
They will never admit someone else are right about them being wrong no matter what topic =. 101 in the corporate greed book</div></div><hr />

<br />
A kid in our guild has leveled 6 alts. On 10 minutes from hitting level 110 he got a legendary. He then proceeded to go through all of his characters and receive a legendary on all of them he even calls it that he's going to get one.<br />
<br />
Another guy in our guild on his demon hunter alt. He got 2 legendaries in one day.<br />
<br />
This system is fucked. Meanwhile i'm running at least 5 mythic +'s a day on top of wq caches + raiding.<br />
<br />
I do not mean when it was bugged this happened yesterday and the day before that as of this post.<br />
<br />
Yeah is all BS i got legendarys on both of my alt first day at 110 and on my main i just got my first one today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;The changes you’re seeing so far are focused primarily on how each spec plays in terms of mechanics, rotations, ability sets, talent options, etc. As some of these changes are fairly significant, we haven’t been making many adjustments to overall performance just yet. We need each spec to be completely functional before we can start tuning its effectiveness.&quot;<br />
<br />
If they were really just concerns with mechanics/rotation there wouldn't have been any numbers tuning yet. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I don't think you thought that all the eay through. if a developer is trying to eliminate dead time in a slower rotation, they wouldn't just change cooldowns or GCD impacts. They would adjust the output to produce the same damage/healing over time. It might need other adjustments later, but its silly to think they wouldn't catch the basic stuff in the first pass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It ain't the worst...but it ain't any better either. Grinding has never been good and AP grinding is just replacing whatever grind they used in the other expansions to keep people busy. I can't see those WQs anymore cause you feel like you need to do 15 every single day and have to fly all over the place for it...again, and again, and again. If we would at least have some &quot;port me to the next WQ-spot&quot;-stone without cooldown. Yes, we got a lot of different dailies...but they are still just random tasks that get boring after the 3 time...and we did them all like 20-30 times by now and there seems to be no end.<br />
<br />
Nomi is pretty annoying. The idea is nice, but seriously...you'd have all the best dish(on max level, cause there was just one) in your book by now(and max skill) with less food thrown away in any other expansion. Again it feels like a grind...add randomnes to make it worse.<br />
<br />
Class mechanics/balance. As a shadow I hate it like every expansion we had when it comes to my class. This is not different. You level slower than others, you have much more problems in solo game, your niche and playing style has to change with every expansion, and you get nuked down by every freaking pvp player that sees you somewhere cause you are like the easiest &quot;zero risk&quot; target out there(you help some melee at the beach that is at 25% and being nuked...he survives with 10%...turns around and sends you right to the graveyard while basicly being immune...cause well...that's 15% towards WQ in a few seconds without risk...who cares for being thankful there? If I go to those WQ arenas and anyone is up for pvp and not just killing the PvE-mobs then I have to stick near NPCs where I can leave the arena or get out of the pvp-area cause I just got no chance aside from self-silencing to survive more than 10 seconds, and my ilvl is 860. I constantly feel like a coward...but my choice is &quot;coward or dead&quot;...what would you pick? If I could at least stay within the pvp-area and run away from my enemies...but nope...either run out, search for low ilvl targets with low health, dot everyone in a hugh brawl from as far as possible or die. I often feel like druids or rogues are just waiting for a shadow to come in as free loot pinata).<br />
That this expansions competitive playing style is only useful in raids(while we got no actual way of doing competitive damage in instances etc.) and involves dieing(never a fun experience) makes that part likely the worst in all expansions so far(and shadows got hit hard before. For example just being in raids for buffs or as mobile mana pot). That shadows actually seem to be a bit better than other classes at certain fights in raids on the very high end with a certain ilvl AND certain legendaries does NOT mean that shadows are finally competitive....it just shows how messed up that build is.<br />
<br />
I basicly like the idea of dropping legendaries. With bad luck protection it's better than running the same raid like 100 times to finally craft one for sure. It's sucks tho if they become mandatory and they are not all similar useful(says the dude with only one legendary that is the worst for my class. At least the stats are okay...for 860. ;-)). What truely pisses me off is shadow-related again: My drop chance for legendaries gets increased with the a lot of content that forces me into a skilltree that means not only much more needed skill but as well involves taking more risk than any other class...not to mention that it's much less forgiving when it comes to a not having an above average connection or hardware...and includes my final death. So either I feel like being carried or I have to use a skill that is a slap in the face...after the self-silence we get the self-kill...yay...next expansion maybe the self-port-to-the-next-graveyard(would at least save us some time)?Just a suggestion...<br />
<br />
Overall I still think it's a decent to good expansion. The storytelling was never this good, the quests etc. are much more interesting...and even the grinding was worse before(nonetheless it's still grinding tho...just that it needed a bit longer to become annoying than usually). There is a lot to do(unfortunately not everything is equally rewarding. So you often have to bench fun stuff for the sake of more rewarding things.), the areas feel populated(if you have ever been on a ghost server, you know what that means for the fun). Order hall is a clear upgrade to garrisons cause it doesn't feel so time consuming and lonely. <br />
Lots of interesting ideas...unfortunately poorly executed at times. Not more to say about shadows...;-)</div></div><hr />

They mention a &quot;Mage&quot; more than any other class in their examples....lol? like are you devs unaware of how many other classes are in this game?. It's understandable that classes are attuned based on data collected by raiding, but nerfing classes rather than giving them a rotation that rewards a great player from a average player has been eliminated. How much more can you butter up that a player that has no legendary can out perform a player who has both his Bis? That's bullshit and they are to ignorant to admit it because they f'd up the entire process of which legendary is obtained. Maybe not everyone feels the same way, but I'm just giving my opinon on what I've seen so far.</div></div><hr />

We'll progress at our own pace and have fun doing it. Not the pace of what other guilds are doing or what other pace they are at. If your sole joy in WoW is being the best at whatever regardless if you have fun doing it, are able to hang out with and be social with those in your guild regardless of the outcome or what is going on then you are the problem with WoW. It is a game, meant to have fun with some competition but nothing is mandatory. To make something mandatory is folly as it is then no longer a game but a job. You can say you play football, but unless you're getting paid for it, it is just a game and to be had for fun, regardless if you win or lose. You get paid, it becomes a job..... aka the NFL. This whole legendary this, legendary that, its holding me back is B.S. The fact that not every single person in the guild raid team has the best in slot legendary is not what's stopping you from meeting your mark and clearing the raid. That is a personal problem, either not knowing what you're doing or making errors that are costing you... not the legendaries. Also the amount of progression guilds that are top end are so minor in number that any other guilds shouldn't have the stresses to be the best of the best or the best around. SO... take a chill pill, relax, have fun and not worry about not having mythic cleared with not wipes and being on farm. Raids are supposed to be challenging, to take effort and never be on farm.</div></div><hr />

An eloquent and well thought out response. Literally sim with and without a legendary. The difference is minimal at best. And since you people seem to be talking about pugging, no pug LFG dude is gonna be checking out legendaries on every applicant. No, not gonna happen. <br />
