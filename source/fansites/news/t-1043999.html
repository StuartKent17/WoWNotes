Account-wide Mounts<br />
We are going to be testing out account wide features with Pet Battles that are coming with the introduction of Mists of Pandaria. If this proves to be successful, then we may even consider doing the same thing with mounts.

Dont we already have Account-Wide mount via Blizz store and Annual pass... so why can't they do account wide mounts earlier than MOP? Build up hype is all I can see... same as heriloom sending across realms. I think all the tech and how to is there, blizz holding back for MOP. but thats my 2cents</div></div><hr />

If I remember right you still get a discount on DIII if you get the CE and have a WoW Annual Pass. They give you 3 free months of WoW subs or something?<br />

I would LOVE for them to make account-wide mounts and pets. Part of the reason I feel so restricted to my main is because I've invested quite a bit of money on things like TCG mounts and pets. If those are my account wide, I wouldn't feel so much less &quot;awesome&quot; while playing on one of my alts.</div></div><hr />

The point is that Daily Blink made that picture to make people whine (as inferred by it's title, &quot;The fine art of pissing off two fanbases at once&quot;). They got it just about right.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure if that's what they meant with it. It certainly doesn&quot;t piss me off as a wow player.Also for some reason i have pretty low expectations of diablo. I will buy and play it but it doesn't look like it could replace wow at all. Especially the auction house with real money looks TERRIBLE.

I already did the annual pass thing, and I almost feel sorry for it cos now that I already will have the game I'm not gonna get the collector's edition and thus not this awesome pet..<br />
<br />
What if I purchase the Diablo III Collector's Edition?<br />
<br />
If you decide to purchase the Diablo III Collector's Edition when it's available, and then choose to add your Collector's Edition license key to the Battle.net account associated with your existing World of Warcraft Annual Pass promotion, you will receive all of the benefits associated with the Collector's Edition, plus receive four months of World of Warcraft game time which is eligible towards your 12-month subscription commitment. After you purchase the Diablo III Collector's Edition you just need to input the product key into the Battle.net account associated with your World of Warcraft 12-month commitment and that account will then receive the next 4 months of World of Warcraft game time for free. For example, if you already had a month of game time on the associated World of Warcraft account when you input your Diablo III Collector's Edition product key, it would then be 5 months until your next subscription payment was due<br />

<br />
Actually they have, except the bits of them being the most powerful species in the universe who were capable of corrupting Sargeras himself, which was rather retconned to what we have now which had been done with TBC, heck, pre-WoW there was nothing notable about Worgen, regarding Worgen, similar to how Worgen that are of Druids of the Scythe were nothing really more than a bread-crumb quest in Duskwood with the Arugal's Worgen being almost irrelevant and as valuable as a fat Panda assisting in the founding of Durotar in WC3:TFT.,<br />
<br />
On a side-note, yours is the kind that has different views on the game to the point that, the below quote does the best job at explaining it:<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes it seems to me that the best boss ever for some people will be something like:<br />
<br />
You start the encounter. An enormous super-duper badass thing comes out. And than just crits the whole raid for gazilion damage. Bam. Everyone dead. <br />
After that the badass thing just ass rapes your naked body to the sounds of Never Gonna Give You Up and you can not release the spirit and are forced to watch that for 30 minutes.<br />
Since that will be really cool and unbeatable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The word &quot;stolen&quot; is not a good word when talking about game development. Blizzard borrowed from several successful MMOs to make WoW, most notably SWG and EQ. It's simply MMO evolution. Every game that has decided to wing it has come to a crashing halt. As one of the Comm Managers at Blizz said recently, they don't innovate anything either, they simply apply what already works and try to make it better. There's an old adage - don't reinvent the wheel.<br />
<br />
Now if WoW was your first MMO, everything you see after it will look like it was taken from WoW. The book &quot;The Battle for Azeroth&quot; will also enlighten you as to how WoW came to be, and it wasn't created in a vacuum. As a 27 year veteran of RPGs/MUDs/MMOs, I can assure you there's no such thing as stealing ideas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blink never &quot;pulled WoW down&quot; by comparing it to Skyrim, that was just a misinterpretation from your standard ignorant ragers. And I certainly don't see how this comic pulls TOR down.<br />
<br />
Ironically, your own 2-dimensional fanboyism is showing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dont we already have Account-Wide mount via Blizz store and Annual pass... so why can't they do account wide mounts earlier than MOP? Build up hype is all I can see... same as heriloom sending across realms. I think all the tech and how to is there, blizz holding back for MOP. but thats my 2cents<br />
<br />
Just need to think for a few minutes and you'll understand... unlike pets (since cata), we still have mounts that are faction exclusive and should never show up on any other toon from the oposite factions.<br />
<br />
So, again, unlike &quot;free for all&quot; heirlooms and blizzard store BoA items, they can't just use the same &quot;simple&quot; system they have for it. They will need a system that will check every single mount you have and translate to the correct one when you're receiving them on your oposite faction toon. Exactly like a faction change, but they can't just use the faction change system either.<br />
<br />
Since I doubt they'll would go for any kind of dumb &quot;easy now, worse later&quot; route, they're probably thinking about what to do in a way that it will be pratical to be used and will get a trouble-free implementation on this 7 year old game that wasn't designed with Account Wide stuff in mind.<br />
<br />
They'll get it, but not now, because they're alread developing this new system for the account pets and achievements and if everything goes as they plan, they'll update it to support the mounts. No reason to create two separate systems for the same thing just to give one part of it &quot;nao!&quot;.</div></div><hr />
