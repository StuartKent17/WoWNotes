Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
do you think we'll ever get to the point where MMO's could rely less on numbers for combat?<br />
Sure. I don't know what MMOs will look like in the future. Destiny seems to have fewer numbers than WoW. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/682421127931662336))<br />
<br />
Although I'll never forgive you for Chakra. I do miss your thoughts/musings on WoW. The other devs have gone radio silent!<br />
Lol I didn't invent Chakra. I just agreed Holy needed something besides generic healing spells. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/682419764875161600))<br />
I wish you had have told us earlier. and I now regret all the crabs we tortured and slew in retaliation for Chakra.<br />
I've gone on record as saying I don't think &quot;form swapping&quot; works in any game. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/683005688142929921))<br />

Wrath of the Lich King Timewalking Event<br />
Through the end of the day on Monday, Timewalking is back. For these six days, take a trip to Northrend and experience these five Heroic dungeons:<br />
<br />
<br />
Ahn’kahet: The Old Kingdom<br />
Gundrak<br />
Halls of Lightning<br />
The Nexus<br />
Utgarde Pinnacle <br />
<br />
<br />
Don’t forget to pick up the event-only quest “A Frozen Path Through Time” before you queue up for Timewalking, as it rewards a valuable Seal of Inevitable Fate. Also worth noting are the additional rewards that were added in patch 6.2.2 for Timewalking events – be sure to check out the all details in the patch notes (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/19828438/).<br />
<br />
Which of the dungeons above are you looking forward to the most?<br />

Activision Blizzard Acquires the Business of Major League Gaming<br />
Activision Blizzard, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATVI) today announced the acquisition of the business of Major League Gaming (MLG). MLG is a leader in creating and streaming premium live gaming events, organizing professional competitions and running competitive gaming leagues. The acquisition expands Activision Blizzard's reach across the rapidly-growing esports ecosystem by adding proven live streaming capabilities and technologies to the Activision Blizzard Media Networks division, led by former ESPN CEO Steve Bornstein and MLG Co-founder Mike Sepso.<br />
<br />
Bobby Kotick, Chief Executive Officer of Activision Blizzard, said, &quot;Our acquisition of Major League Gaming's business furthers our plans to create the ESPN of esports. MLG's ability to create premium content and its proven broadcast technology platform - including its live streaming capabilities - strengthens our strategic position in competitive gaming. MLG has an incredibly strong and seasoned team and a thriving community. Together, we will create new ways to celebrate players and their unique skills, dedication and commitment to gaming. We are excited to add Sundance and the entire MLG esports team to our competitive gaming initiatives.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sundance DiGiovanni, Chief Executive Officer and MLG Co-founder, said, &quot;Our mission for over 12 years has been to promote and expand the growth of competitive gaming worldwide, and today the industry is at a key inflection point as its popularity soars and rivals that of many traditional professional sports. This acquisition and Activision Blizzard's commitment to competitive gaming will expand the opportunities for gamers to be recognized and celebrated for their competitive excellence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike Sepso, Senior Vice President of Activision Blizzard Media Networks and MLG Co-founder, said, &quot;Sundance and I founded MLG to highlight the incredible talent of competitive gamers all over the world. Activision Blizzard's esports leadership, incredible intellectual property and long history in competitive gaming create a perfect home for MLG's capabilities. The acquisition of MLG's business is an important step towards Activision Blizzard Media Networks' broader mission to bring esports into the mainstream by creating and broadcasting premium esports content, organizing global league play and expanding distribution with key gaming partners.&quot;<br />
<br />
MLG will continue to operate MLG.tv, MLG Pro Circuit and GameBattles platforms, and will continue to work with its partners and other publishers across the industry. MLG.tv is a premium online broadcast network for professional-level esports and the MLG Pro Circuit is the longest-running esports league in North America. GameBattles is the largest online gaming tournament system across consoles, PC and mobile platforms.<br />
<br />
With over 100 million unique viewers, the esports audience is estimated to be bigger than audiences for many professional sports leagues. Creating premium content for these audiences will provide significant opportunities in ticket sales, advertising, sponsorships, licensing and merchandising. By 2017, esports is projected to have over 300 million viewers1. For the past 12 years, MLG has helped bring esports into the mainstream with broadcasts of professional gaming competitions that rival traditional sports fan engagement. <br />

tbh it was really easy, only problem was people being to slow up the hill to avoid the packs of adds, died because of it, released and getting kicked because it takes too long to wait.</div></div><hr />

Sadly its WAY too common these days. Like 60% of the PVP 2 handed weapons in the last 5 years have been so short, yet 1 handers just get bigger and bigger.</div></div><hr />

The size of the Holy Paladin weapon is just right. The idea of wielding a 2handed weapon and a book is common in Warcraft Paladin lore.<br />
I hope they don't scale it down, and that it sits on the back when seathed.<br />
<br />
I wonder if they'll let us transmog the book individually, and if the mace will be considered a 2H or 1H (e.g. for transmog/wardrobe).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Warcraft games, especially Warcraft 3, the paladins used a large two-handed hammer and carried it in one hand, and a tome in the other or hanging by the waist. Blizzard is going back to the class fantasy it was all built upon.<br />
<br />
Protection is already wielder of shields, so I see it fit a lot for Blizzard wanting to separate the feel of the specs, and it just makes lots of sense for the holy paladin to be holding a tome filled with Light bringing words to yell over the battle to heal or cast protective spells on his/her allies.<br />
<br />
The whole thing shield randomly started with World of Warcraft anyway.</div></div><hr />

2.) Some of those designs look like they're from a cartoon. Waiting for Bugs Bunny or Tom to pop up or something. Kind of reminds me of the mallets used to hit the target in the strength games at carnivals, too.<br />
3.) Hopefully Blizzard fixes the female blood elf run because a mace of that size will clip into her legs. It's bad enough it happens with staves and longer axes. The model viewer animation is still the same so I have no hope for Blizzard fixing it. The old run didn't do that. Really love how no one is complaining about the female blood elf run clipping with unsheathed long weapons such as staves, axes, and maces. Here I thought blood elves was one of the more common races yet I see every other race with complaints but no one complaining about female blood elves.<br />
<br />
Wonder if it'll be a 2h for transmog purposes because I'd rather use an axe or a sword, not a cartoon mace. If I had my way, I'd rather have a shield over the book, too. I thought when we finally got (actual) librams, it'd be as a visible accessory sitting on our belt that's maybe used in various animations like holy light and thus would be in addition to our 1h/shield, not instead of our shield. While I'm aware that Warcraft 3 paladins used the libram and no shield and seems to be where Blizzard is going, I want my shield. MY class fantasy for my paladin is being overridden by what Blizzard thinks my paladin should be. WoW is an RPG. If I want my paladin with a shield, I should be able to have one. Really annoying when Blizzard limits our choices and by extension the RP side of the game. I'm not an RPer, but that doesn't mean I still don't have some kind of idea of what or who my character is.<br />
<br />
Since I doubt Blizzard will add in additional artifact models in beta, here's hoping they add in some more variable designs that aren't so cartoony with the second raid tier.<br />
<br />
Guess this may finally give me an excuse to not go holy in Legion. Been telling myself since Cata I won't heal with the new expansion, but I always end up doing it. Between the looks of the artifact and potentially how long it'll take to level a second one, having an offspec will be less desirable for many players come Legion.</div></div><hr />

Jesus.<br />
<br />
They should have just made it a real 2H weapon and baked the tome model in to either the tier sets or belts. Hell, there's already a belt model in the game which has a tome attached to it.<br />
<br />
Then again, they gave prot a sword so... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Between the looks of the artifact and potentially how long it'll take to level a second one, having an offspec will be less desirable for many players come Legion.<br />

Now if only there was something that allowed you to change your gear to look like any other suitable gear in the game... I wonder what they would call such a wonderous system...</div></div><hr />

Because you can transmog a Tome in to a Shield, amirite? I'd say it's split down the middle when it comes to those who hate this artifact set. I'd be 'indifferent' if I could at least mog that book in to a shield or they just turned it in to a armor design with the mace behing 2H.<br />
<br />
As it stands, the only thing worse than this set is the state which Retribution is in in the Alpha and the direction Blizzard is trying to go with it...</div></div><hr />

I was with a pug group that ran thru 3 timewalking dungeons, and we were on a great roll, when Pit popped up as the next one. Three in the group immediately spoke up about how badly they hated that instance and left. The two of us that remained tried to queue up for it, but every player who joined immediately left. I don't understand why people hate that instance so much.</div></div><hr />

You can transmog this tome into a shield, because it IS a shield. Look at the item link above the video. The book is classified as a shield, and even has armor.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard needs to stop hiring rich hipster neets to do their work.<br />
<br />
Also, Chad: Why do you keep labeling stuff &quot;Legion Beta&quot;. It's not beta. It's still alpha unless Blizzard makes an official announcement.</div></div><hr />

Right? I laughed heartily. He is only human, and his opinions aren't really more valuable than anybody else's at the end of the day. He offers some insights, but opinions are just that.</div></div><hr />

All other weapons seems pretty cool an balanced. But this weapon is nothing but a big deception. They're big, they're ugly, they're a reason why transmog exists.</div></div><hr />
