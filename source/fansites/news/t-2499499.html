Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where Beguiling Emissaries were not contributing to enemy forces in Tol Dagor and Siege of Boralus.<br />
Azshara’s Eternal Palace<br />
<br />
Radiance of Azshara<br />
<br />
Radiance of Azshara can now be properly damaged by the Protection Paladin talent Blessed Hammer (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/204019-blessed-hammer).<br />
<br />
The Queen’s Court<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug causing Rogues to be removed from stealth at the beginning of the fight.<br />
<br />
Queen Azshara<br />
<br />
Increased the time to complete Phase 3 to 180 seconds (was 120 seconds) on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Fixed an issue that caused the first Overzealous Hulk to spawn with more health than intended in all difficulties.<br />
Fixed an issue that sometimes caused Titan Console extra action button to not appear during Phase 4 on all difficulties.<br />
Titanic Machinations now alter the power of Ancient Wards and Wards of Power at a rate of 16 per second (was 21 per second) on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Queen Azshara's minions Berserk at the beginning of Phase 4 of the encounter on Mythic difficulty. Phase 3 now ends automatically after 3 minutes (was 2 minutes).<br />
<br />
<br />
Operation: Mechagon<br />
<br />
King Mechagon<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that sometimes caused Giga-Zap (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/292267-giga-zap) to ignore line of sight.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Followers and Missions<br />
<br />
The first two Rank 3 Worldvein Essence missions (&quot;Investigating the Rumors (https://www.wowdb.com/garrison/missions/2159-investigating-the-rumors)&quot; and &quot;Finding a Key (https://www.wowdb.com/garrison/missions/2160-finding-a-key)&quot;) now indicate that completing them unlocks subsequent missions. Their base Azerite rewards were removed, and their bonus rewards have been increased.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Resolved an issue where Vexiona could block progression for players during &quot;In the Shadow of Crimson Wings (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/55657-in-the-shadow-of-crimson-wings)&quot;.</div></div><hr />
