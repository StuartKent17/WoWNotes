<br />
All games have a demo area at BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
What's telling is that the Diablo area is inside the Mythic stage hall. In previous years, games with new titles had their demo area blacked out and blocked off so nothing would be leaked as people filed into the Hall. This year the Diablo area is right in front of everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
RIP new diablo game.<br />
<br />
IMO, this almost certainly confirms a new Diablo game coming out. That close to the main &quot;Mythic&quot; stage, that much open room next to the demo space, the fact that Diablo 3's What's Next panel is right after the opening ceremonies...this all paints a very clear picture that IMO goes far past just D3 on Switch.<br />
<br />
It's also worth noting how close the &quot;All Access Channel Live&quot; area is to it. I'm pretty sure that's the spot where they bring devs up and do interviews and commentary for the Virtual Ticket. Given that Diablo and WoW are the two games around it, it stands to logic that those would be the two main games to be featured. That may be a stretch, but it does seem like they'd want the most focused games to be near that area so devs could quickly watch gameplay and come up for interviews.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have two respones:<br />
<br />
1. It could still be covered until after the announcement like prior years<br />
2. It might not be a demo of the new game, OW was announced w/o a demo. It's very possible there isnt one yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also the other panel being &quot;Diablo World and QA&quot; makes me think itll be an open world-esque d4 game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the layout from last year. They didn't move the bathroom but they did reorient the direction the Mythic Stage faces and removed a lot of seating from that hall. <br />

The map you linked has two big concrete bathrooms across from each other. The 2018 map only has one of the big concrete bathrooms.<br />
<br />
Like I said, they either remodeled or the map is wrong. The dimensions are also laughably wrong.<br />

To piggyback off the others: Diablo has a demo area out in the main floor while SC2 has it tucked away in side of the hall where the tournament is going on. That also seems to be some kinda indicator of something major.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are correct. The first few were oriented this way (and the concerts were in the arena for the first two years). <br />
<br />
This is a highly unusual arrangement. My two takeaways from this are that its a LOT of wasted space in hall D unless they are going to double the size of the diablo demo area (pending a big announcement). Putting a huge area on the map now would sort of show their hand. Also, this makes me wonder if they are going for a more low key musical guest this year like Video Games Live, or a comedy act, where they simply aren't anticipating needing the seating. Otherwise, this makes no sense at all to me. Even Blink 182 filled in more seats than that and the Ozzy concert was terrible because this layout by default puts most people very far away from the stage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Demo&quot; is short for Demonstration. Does not need to be a playable game demo. So who knows, maybe it is the next Diablo game, and they are simply referring to the area as &quot;Diablo 3 demo&quot; to avoid spoiling the actual title before the actual announcement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wake me up when Diablo 4 goes Gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or even D2 remastered which is something I've wanted for a very long time.<br />
<br />
Either way I'm crossing my fingers and toes for something exciting from the Diablo franchise.</div></div><hr />

I really enjoyed both their previous blizzcon performances but they most definitely don't have the draw of Foo Fighters, Linkin Park, or Metallica. Hell even Weird Al was pretty packed hall. So if it was them or someone like them then it would totally make sense to split Hall D as they have. Otherwise, i will be unhappy. <br />
<br />
We're 3 weeks out though and no musical announcement though. Maybe they just flat out aren't having one this year.</div></div><hr />

Tenacious D was my favorite. :p I love those guys. Weird Al was a close second, though.</div></div><hr />

There is a bunch of open space next to the D3 demos. If you recall back to 2014 there was a big empty spot on the map where the Overwatch computers were for those demos. My theory is that they are making it out to be small but is actually twice as big because if they just left Diablo demos off the map it would be too obvious and if they made it huge it would be obvious as well.</div></div><hr />

It's the first Blizzcon that I won't watch and I don't care AT ALL.<br />
<br />
The fact that I had to unsub from wow because I had nothing to do (since I don't raid anymore) and the horrendous price increase of the virtual ticket coupled with the reduction of panels numbers and durations and the frankly pretty shit digital goodies this years have just kill my interest for the thing altogether, which is quite a feat for a long, LONG time fan.<br />

For those wondering about Inclusion Nexus, <br />
“Last year, we had a diversity meet-up,” says Stevens. “That was an initial step for us as an organization, to have open, casual conversations and be able to hear from our players first hand what’s important to them. We collected all of that feedback from that event and that helped shape what has become this year’s Inclusion Nexus.”<br />

I highly doubt it, they've basically abandoned the game.<br />
<br />
To suddenly come back and be like &quot;SURPRISE NEW XPAC ON OUR GAME WE FORGOT ABOUT FOR LIKE A YEAR, OOPS, COME BACK AND PLAY!&quot;<br />
<br />
The last semi-major patch 2.6.1 was literally a year ago...<br />
<br />
Wasn't even a major patch.</div></div><hr />

Ok, but this means nothing as long as Blizzard continues to lock LGBT threads in the forums (like this one: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20767376653) instead of punishing trolls and homophobic comments. Blizzard's always been seen as a homophobic-supporter company and that make believe &quot;meet-up&quot; is honestly insulting.</div></div><hr />
