We’ve got some new stuff coming to the Pet Store, and we wanted to give everyone a quick sneak peek. Obviously, the Pet Store has been the place where we sell pets and mounts, but we’ve come up with some new types of cosmetic goodies, including some fun new little toys and Transmogrifiables.<br />
<br />
First up: a trio of cosmetic helms for Transmogrification. (http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/95474.jpg Jewel of the Firelord (http://www.wowdb.com/items/95474-jewel-of-the-firelord), http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/97213.jpg Hood of Hungering Darkness (http://www.wowdb.com/items/97213-hood-of-hungering-darkness), and http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/95475.jpg Crown of Eternal Winter (http://www.wowdb.com/items/95475-crown-of-eternal-winter)) When Transmog went into the game, people immediately started talking about the possibility of just buying armor looks. So we’re going ahead and forging a few helms and seeing how they fit. They don’t have any stats, they’re just for looks, and you can use them to change the appearance of the helms for any characters of any class or race (they work with all armor types). They’re great for spicing up a Transmog set—or replacing a tier head piece you hate the looks of. No need to check that ‘Hide Helm’ box any longer!<br />

<br />
Here are a few images, but keep in mind that these are all special-effecty and animated in a really cool way. You may have even seen these models pop up on Wowhead or MMO-Champion earlier this year.<br />
<br />
We’re also trying out something else new. A lot of people have liked the kinds of fun, limited-use items you can get from the WoW TCG—so we’re taking that idea to the Pet Store. Soon you’ll be able to snag two fun new little toys: the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/97994.jpg Seesaw (http://www.wowdb.com/items/97994-seesaw) and http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/98549.jpg Iron Hitching Post (http://www.wowdb.com/items/98549-iron-hitching-post)!<br />
<br />
You can jump on the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/97994.jpg Seesaw (http://www.wowdb.com/items/97994-seesaw) with a party member and relive the childhood glee of trying to slam your friend into the ground . . . or you can have a big ogre named Lunk launch them into the air. Really, though, you’ll probably just look super cute gazing lovingly into each other’s eyes. D’awwwww.<br />
<br />
<br />

True story: Worgen are exactly the same weight as Ogres.<br />
<br />
The http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/98549.jpg Iron Hitching Post (http://www.wowdb.com/items/98549-iron-hitching-post) is a little different: It’s an item you set down that allows you and up to 24 of your closest raiding cohorts to each jump on your own new unearthly Iron Warhorse (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/142910-iron-warhorse) mount. You can use it for smaller parties too, and it’s also great for Battlegrounds. Imagine the look on your opponents’ faces when they see a unified front of ghost horses galloping toward them . . . just to ruin everything and capture Snowfall Graveyard. (STOP IT!)<br />

Hyah ghost-steed! Later I’ll feed you some ghost-oats in the ghost-barn.<br />
<br />
We don’t have specific release dates for any of these items yet, but you can expect to see them show up in the Pet Store in the near future.<br />
<br />
Let us know what you think, and what other kinds of fun and cosmetic items you might like to see in the Pet Store in the comments below!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good is very subjective.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think they are cool, but it's all cosmetic. I won't buy it, and my gameplay experience won't be harmed in the slightest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you think this qualifies as good, then yes. Personally, I don't like the 3 showcased so far.<br />
<br />
Makes sense expanding this, I don't care myself how a company makes their money. Be it B2P, P2P, F2P with cashshop or any combination of it.<br />
Mount looks nice however, so might pick that one up some day ^^</div></div><hr />

Doesn't matter. Implementing store-bought items inevitibly means having less and poorer quality cosmetic things obtainable in-game.</div></div><hr />

In reality they are cosmetic. Hell there are things already available for money in this game. What is wrong with it being at the store vs on a card?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they were switching to a free 2 play model, I could understand this. But they are getting ENOUGH money from the monthly subscription already.<br />
<br />
Something like those helms and fun items should be acquired ingame, through an (epic) quest or something, which might even be challenging. But just selling those items? Come on now...</div></div><hr />

Didn't happen with mounts. Or pets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have been putting mounts/pets in the store forever and still make awesome mounts/pets in game as well. I don't see why this would be any different.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AutomaticBadger</div><div class="date">2013-07-13, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sigh... For real people. What is different about these two alone? A mount you can't obtain from in game is equality selling out and selling cash only transmog gear. Both are just aesthetics and don't confer anything better then that in the game.<br />
<br />
So chill peeps.</div></div><hr />

Its very likely, look at the Mounts. The store gets an amazing looking bat while raiders get a PvP mount low-quality reskin.</div></div><hr />

Chill out, calling them Greedy bastards isn't exactly a rational response. It's COSMETIC. Heck half the stuff they just showed doesn't look like anything I'd touch.<br />

<br />
Since when were cosmetics not a part of the game that we're paying for? Since when were they not included in our subscriptions???<br />
<br />
Getting sick of this argument. Without cosmetics this games just a load of maths and RNG, the cosmetics ARE what makes it a game and creates the world. Infact, now we have transmog, cosmetic appearance is JUST as important to a lot of players as the quality of the armour. <br />
<br />
Speaking as a Rogue, our latest PVP AND PVE armours have been PISS poor for a long time. Ranging from &quot;really lazy and not thought out&quot; to &quot;a fuckin horrendous mess&quot;. Last season we had to look like someone had emptied their KFC leftovers over our heads. Blizzard actually designing cooler armour to sell for an additional cost is an insult.<br />
<br />
This is MEANT to be a Pay to Pay model. With Blizzard trying to have a F2P model at the same time, and getting every penny they can from players, is IS a pisstake and disrespectful to those with subscriptions, even if you aren't using that armour.</div></div><hr />

I for one would prefer that they didn't waste their precious time by making all kinds of things to sell, even if it's just cosmetic. And instead use their resources on the actual game.<br />

Heck after pet battles where added, you get some actual benefit. Other than cosmetic/fun from buying the store pets. Several of them are very good.<br />

It is a rational response. Rift which is a FREE game has a cosmetic cash shop but ever single cosmetic bit of gear can also be found free in the game. I don't care that there is transmog items for real money on wow but there should also be a way to get them in game as well.<br />

They are charging you for unique and high quality (unobtainable) models. In a subscription based game where they have a large emphasis on cosmetics. Challenge modes are an example of this, they offer high quality armour sets for completing difficult challenges. By adding gear into a micro transaction system, its just inexcusable.

Micro-transactions are great, so long as they don't break the game. A lot of people pay for this stuff, and Blizzard will make a ton from it that goes back into creating more game content.<br />

How can anyone be opposed? If you don't want to buy anything, fine, don't. But at least see the obvious benefit this will be to the game as a whole. What Blizzard invest in this they get back a thousand-fold.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly the point. It's not about &quot;if it's cosmetic or not&quot;, it's about taking things that should be included in the subcription fee and charging extra for them.<br />
<br />
Nobody really knows how far this is going to go. Just look at SwTor - you have to pay extra for additional hairstyles, races and quests on top of subscription fees. Is Wow going to end up like that? Are they going to try to boosts store sales by putting less cool stuff into the sub-only game?</div></div><hr />

WoW has most often emphasized the importance of stats on gear, not the looks. Until the shop has stat gear, it isn't a big deal; meanwhile GW2 adds an item to Black Lion chests that grants a level/skill point but people say its ok because its a free monthly game :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nobody really knows how far this is going to go. Just look at SwTor - you have to pay extra for additional hairstyles, races and quests on top of subscription fees. Is Wow going to end up like that? Are they going to try to boosts store sales by putting less cool stuff into the sub-only game?<br />
<br />
pretty sure up until mists we were already paying for races and quests</div></div><hr />

I just can't imagine why people care...they have literally no benefit to the person and again, why do you hate the idea of Blizzard making money? I hope they do release all the new character models and charge real money for it. I will happily pay it and look down on all the peasants who cringe at the idea of spending $5 or whatever it is to unlock it. What is $5 to me?<br />
<br />
I fully support Blizzard in this and hope they expand on their cash shop to bring more cool transmogs out. I hope it makes them lots of money so they put more time and effort into making it look pretty because I want to look cool in this game. Too many fancy things are hidden behind silly barriers like getting a high arena rating or killing some boss on heroic or some other nonsense. If I can just shell out $5 to get it and go about doing things I find fun, great. If that makes you mad...well, too bad for you. It's the way forward and Blizzard is going for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard can and probably will get away with it, but at the same time, it's also ruining the mmo as a whole. Ideally, an mmo like World of Warcraft should be restricted to the world alone, as half the game focuses on a sense of world-building and immersion. Introducing things outside of the world ruins the immersive aspect. The other point to note is that it cheapens the overall experience. <br />
<br />
Logically thinking, there's not much to WoW other than getting gear and being better than others. However the side aspects are all cosmetic, such as the look of your character, the amount of achievements, pet/mount collecting etc. With such an emphasis on immersion and collecting, having items outside of the world to easily &quot;enhance&quot; the look of your character, cheapens the overall experience by cutting it short. In a sense, it makes the game less interesting when you know there's an easy way out/around it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orly</div><div class="date">2013-07-13, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WoW has most often emphasized the importance of stats on gear, not the looks. Until the shop has stat gear, it isn't a big deal; meanwhile GW2 adds an item to Black Lion chests that grants a level/skill point but people say its ok because its a free monthly game :P<br />
<br />
It is ok, because it's free. They took the time and work to develop that, and you didn't pay for it because the game is free. Aka it's ok.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in wow, they took your subscription money and developed all these mounts, pets and soon-to-be gear for transmog. And they charge you extra for it. Aka it's not ok.<br />
<br />
Emphasis on the importance of stats on gear, not the looks? Really? Then why are things like the challenge-mode set ? Or why can't I transmog my lv 60 pvp set, even if I can just buy and wear it and look that way if I really want to? Guess it matters after all. <br />
<br />
But now, I really, really wish they would introduce said challenge-mode/lv 60 pvp/ elite pvp set gears on the pet store. For cash. Then people that find this ok would most probably bite their tongue, while those that now disagree will say &quot;What? It's just for the looks. No stats, nothing gamebreaking.

In reality they are cosmetic. Hell there are things already available for money in this game. What is wrong with it being at the store vs on a card?<br />
<br />
Your absolutely right about that, it is already happening in this thread. It's all cosmetic items, it's not mandatory to buy, it wont affect any one's game play if they don't rush to the Blizzard store and buy these items. Also, lets not rush to the (It's the end of the world as we know it) moment just yet.</div></div><hr />

Over the course of MoP we have heard the excuses that they can't make 5 man dungeons because they take too long mostly due to the art and new player models are taking a very long time because the art team needs to find the time in between creating new content. Then all of a sudden they magically find a lot of time to create cosmetic items for the cash shop? Yea...<br />
<br />
Do you even know how much man/hour does it require for someone to create and test an interactable yet new environment? Heck let alone the art and meshing/texturing, the scripting of a frickin' re-used area that is the size of a scenario takes around 3 days time to the point that the application lifecycle is almost as long as two to three weeks time. For a single dungeon that duration is as long a five to six weeks weeks, granted you have the context of it set in place. This takes the effort of a core-team of 3-5 people on an average salary of $5k(insurance and tax included) for each as an average.<br />
<br />
Hence, going by the math of how each subscriber pays a $15 sub, you get to essentially spend around 20k subscription money on a single piece of content that will effectively be enjoyed by a few on the long run. <br />
<br />
Whereas each one of those cosmetic items really are a week's worth of work for a maximum of two people, topping at a cost of $2.5k, sold for $10-20 each, breaking even if 2% of the playerbase purchases them.<br />

Yes it does. Because it's free. If you don't care about competing with others then you don't pay a dime and play at your own leisure. If you want to be on par with absolutely ANYONE in what is essentially a F2P game, then you pay what is akin to a subscription fee to be on par with anyone else. And mind you, bottom line, buying stuff from shops is way cheaper than having a subscription. Because it's not recurring.<br />
<br />
But having BOTH subscription and having to buy cosmetics, which I argued it's an important part of the game? Now THAT is bullshit.</div></div><hr />

Lore is no different than cosmetics - It's intangible content that doesn't affect how you play the game. While you may play for lore, other people may play for cool looks and cosmetic things.<br />

No game charging a sub fee should be using a cash shop to sell digital goods. They are essentially taking your money, then creating content from it to sell back to you for more money.

The 3 items from the shop is nothing compared to the amount of items you get with a new expansion and tier.<br />

Take the mounts for example. There are over 300 mounts in the game, only 5 in the store. That makes up for less than 2% of all the mounts.</div></div><hr />

pretty sure expansions are ingame. and whether lore is found ingame or not its still part of the storyline. also until mists they charged us for new races and classes. they charge us for new zones in expansions. theyve been charging us for items like this since the tcg came out. theres literally nothing on the store they havent been doing for years. only its much cheaper to do it through the store then it is to print thousands of cards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same for me, my crew was all but obliterated the other day flashing wow gang signs on the mean streets of Chicago. We read the recent news about these items being sold in the Blizzard store and that very same day a few of my buddies flipped the F-Out. One of them proceeded to rob a bank, the other one went running through the streets naked screaming (F-U Blizzard, You can't make me spend my money in your online store), before being hit by a car. <br />
<br />
Sadly, it's just me playing World of Warcraft, all a lone. I'm a little scared that with these recent changes to the Blizzard store this could be the beginning of the end for the human race. With WowNet formerly known as (Skynet), adding items to the Blizzard store, who know's what's next, maybe advertising the Wownet product over the internet.<br />
<br />
We need to send players back in time to warn everyone of the impending dangers, if their is any one out there who's up to the challenge let us know on these forums. <br />

But my problem is not that they're adding cosmetic crap into the store. On average ever since tier 6 majority of sets have looked bland and crap. One of the biggest parts of the game for me was the cool looking sets and was the whole reason why I did raid all the way back to when I got nemesis from BWL on my lock. I just thought that Blizzard were running out of ideas but when I see them add this stuff which looks great where you have to pay for it I think Blizzard should start putting a bit more effort in the designs of new tier sets and stop pumping out the same old boring crap when they are perfectly capable of releasing some good new designs. The sets used to be eye catching which is probably transmog is taking off because there is barely anything I class as good looking that has been released lately. I just think it is poor form of Blizzard when they have just proven they are perfectly capable. Im assuming alot of people wont agree but thats my opinion</div></div><hr />

id like it. but anything they put on the cash store would need to be the highest quality for people to spend money on them which means if there were a questline in there it would have top quality voice acting, cutscenes, cool events, and all that. normally in wow quests only have voice acting if they are very important or near the end of the storyline since most people skip them they cant afford to spend money on voice acting on every quest.</div></div><hr />

I would happily pay for a month spent grinding, raiding whatever to get one of those helms and then proudly wear it to show my in game accomplishment. Now? Why bother, everyone will have it so it becomes meaningless. Sure it will still look cool but lose that rather rapidly. Remember the sparkle pony, when that was data mined people were stoked for it, once it became buy-able it was cool for about a day and now you never see it because everyone knows where it came from and no one cares that you have it. Hell you don't even care if you have it. Same will happen with these helms. Will be everywhere for about a week than slowly disappear never to be seen again.</div></div><hr />

Cash shops feel so seedy and weird, I always thought of them as reserved for shittier games. The mounts and pets I could get over because there are TCG mounts and pets, but now they're selling cosmetic gear. How is this any different than MapleStory? And holy cow, don't be surprised if the items get 90 day timers on them and disappear once they're over.</div></div><hr />

I know the fact: &quot;you're not required to play if you don't like it&quot;, but Blizz is making a very bold move from their side with this action that might lead to mass subscriber complaints.. What follows next? Selling unique spells, instant level to 90 or selling unique achievements?<br />

<br />
I see it being very wrong to exlude people for not being willing to pay extra for something they're already paying for.<br />

It's not the idea of a cash shop I oppose, it's cash shop on top of sub fees that I oppose.</div></div><hr />

Cosmetics and aesthetics help to create immersion and setting, which makes playing the game more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Cosmetics are just important as stats.<br />
<br />
And you have cosmetic Items that you can access via playing World of Warcraft, without every having to spend $$$ to buy cosmetic items from the Blizzard store. If you wanted too, you could (Choose) to spend $$$ in the Blizzard store and buy cosmetic items to use in World of Warcraft, but it's not mandatory. It won't harm your gaming experience if you (Choose) not too. <br />
<br />
You have a choice, now if Blizzard were to add items that were mandatory in order to progress through the game, or items that clearly gives one player an advantage over another player then that would be cause for alarm. As it stands right now, it's cosmetic items, items that players have a choice to buy if they want to and it has no affect on any one else's game play what so ever.<br />
<br />
If I'm running around in World of Warcraft with one of those helms, it doesn't stop any one from playing the game, it doesn't force players to have to spend money on a cosmetic helm like I did in order to progress through the game. Sure, players may stop and look at me, maybe send me a whisper asking me where I got that helmet from, but that's it. If someone wants to spend some $$$ and buy one they can, if not oh well, the game will go on. <br />
<br />
Now If this leads into Blizzard at some point down the road charging a Subscription fee, plus requiring players to also spend $$$ for things like content, then I would probably have an issue with that. It's not my money, and I'm sure as hell not going to bitch at someone because they have some extra cash and wish to spend it on a video game for cosmetic items.</div></div><hr />

Just curious about what's wrong with a cash shop intended to just sell cosmetic items. Blizzard has been selling cosmetic mounts and pets for years, and now suddenly gear due to transmogrification. TCG has been around forever and before mounts and pets, and you have to get lucky. I understand it opens avenues for future exploitation of cash only content (Not cosmetics), but at the bare bones just cosmetics; is it really that bad? We've had as players the option to pay more money for cosmetics, it just wasn't in the form of a cash shop.</div></div><hr />

Do you ever heard of anything such as an application lifecycle or product pipeline?<br />
<br />
For an artist, what they present in the store are really pet projects compared to the gargantuan task of creating new models. Furthermore, you can change pets but will you be able to change the look of your model as considering the mixed views we get for the tier pieces that can be changed in the looks, think how would be the outrage and dissatisfaction if unchangeable character models were to be introduced into the game.</div></div><hr />

I never implied this was pay to win, it's the same as mounts &amp; pets. Eventually these items will look better than anything in game, because they will get additional income at ease. I bet they are even weighing up the pay to win option, the race for world firsts will become a matter of wallet size.</div></div><hr />

Then you would easily be categorizing those items in a pay-to-win status. Why?<br />

But we have already paid for the &quot;car&quot; and are paying an active subscription. In your own example, if you paid for a car, and then paid an active subscription to be able to get all of the extra options that you could want updated, sub woofers, body kit etc, then then having to pay extra on top of that for the newest coolest body kit etc just makes the subscription redundant.</div></div><hr />

I agree 100%. It seems like Blizzard is trying so hard to cement WoW as a shitty game. I mean, Cata and MoP were already B quality products, their PR staff is getting more retarded by the day, lore is looking like a 13 years old fanfic, and now they're selling boosts, mount and good-looks.<br />

- Buy 50% increase to LFR boss loot for 7 days.<br />
<br />
None of these things DIRECTLY affect you as another player (because of weekly caps etc), but it's still wrong.<br />

Get away with what exactly ? It's totally optional since it's only cosmetic. Sure some people will buy it and blizz will make money out of it.

If I'm not mistaken, not everything from the TCG is able to be traded, or sold on the AH. You need to buy it with a real world currency and not gold. This has gone on forever, yes? So why is that okay but not an in-game equivalent. I'm sure you'll say it's not but it has been around for a very stupidly long time, way before the implementation of the pet store / mounts.<br />

It's the principle of it. Cool looking stuff is part of the reward structure of this game. When you just allow people to buy it with real money ... How is that not &quot;pay to win&quot;?

I see these arguments all over the place, and it's rather puzzling to me. Blizzard doesn't owe you anything, you pay $15.00 each month for whatever content they have to offer, regardless of how great or bad that content is. There are so many games out there, if you don't like this one, find another one that better suits what you want out of a video game. That's the bottom line, you can dress up your argument anyway you like, this game is what it is, if you don't enjoy it, don't pay for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was my first thought as well. Why do they still call it PET store instead of Blizz store or something?<br />
<br />
Although, as for why there aren't any new pets, it's probably because the Blossoming Ancient is still new.</div></div><hr />

<br />
everytime they add something everyone always says &quot;dont care as long as theres no stats&quot; they know we dont care as long as there is no stats and it isnt pay to win, they know what they can and cant do and how the community will react, its not like these fan sites have a blizzard shield and they cant see what they say they have people whos entire job is just to read forum posts and fan sites to see peoples reactions.</div></div><hr />

I won't buy them, but I'm sure a lot of people will, and not just the &quot;noobs&quot; as most people seem to be thinking. <br />
<br />
My favourite part is all of the people complaining about this, I really don't get where the hate is coming from. Why do people dislike some of the things so much that have literally no impact on them whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Don't worry, they will be releasing the full set once they gauge people's reactions. Unfortunatly they are going to make a killing from people who can't understand how this is bad for the game.</div></div><hr />

You need to buy it with a real world currency and not gold. This has gone on forever, yes? So why is that okay but not an in-game equivalent. I'm sure you'll say it's not but it has been around for a very stupidly long time, way before the implementation of the pet store / mounts.<br />
<br />
I don't think that's okay either. At least the older non-tradeable TCG items do appear on the Black Market AH, and there's a good chance that newer ones will too in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You either have to run 10 dungeons to earn it or just pay $10 to get it? How does it sound when put like this?<br />
<br />
Still, there is an option to get the item in-game if you really want to...This would be to run 100 dungeons for example..The purpose of this would be to open another way for the players to acquire the items and if they feel that their pocket can afford it they have the option to pay in order to avoid the hassle.</div></div><hr />

We’re also trying out something else new. A lot of people have liked the kinds of fun, limited-use items you can get from the WoW TCG—so we’re taking that idea to the Pet Store. Soon you’ll be able to snag two fun new little toys: the Seesaw and Iron Hitching Post!<br />
<br />
Keyword is limited-use. Also, if you mouse-over the seesaw or iron-hitching post, it says they stack to 250. So chances are, you buy it, you get 250 uses of it.</div></div><hr />
