Weekly Bonus Event - Arena Skirmishes<br />
Sharpen your swords and reinforce your boards, because you’re called to the PvP Arena for the hectic mayhem of Skirmishes.<br />
<br />
This Week: Arena Skirmishes<br />
All week, from anywhere in Azeroth, open the Group Finder (default hotkey: i), select the Player vs. Player tab on the bottom of the window, and then under Arena Battles, choose either 2v2 or 3v3 and JOIN BATTLE. You’ll be matched up with teammates and provided with opponents to kill in the Arena.<br />
<br />
Look for the following all week long:<br />
<br />
<br />
Archmage Timear (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44172-the-arena-calls) for you.<br />
<br />

<br />
Passive buff: +50% honor gains from Skirmishes<br />
<br />
<br />
If you’ve been looking to make some Honor gains, this is the week to do it!<br />
<br />
<br />
Darkmoon Faire<br />
The Darkmoon Faire is back in town! There are a few things it offers that you can take advantage of:<br />
<br />
<br />

Ride the carousel for the WHEE! (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/46668-whee) buff grants a 10% increase to reputation and experience gains.<br />

<br />
you know nighthold come out the 17th which meen it's in 2 week giving them still next week to pull 7.1.5 a week before it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Misskittyy</div><div class="date">2017-01-03, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still no 7.1.5? Are they really going to release it on the same week of The Nighthold opening? ... Come on Blizzard...my prediction has always been the 10th. They didn't do it before the holidays because well, holidays. The 3rd would have been too soon after the holidays, most likely their first day back at HQ. They won't release it at the same time NH releases because that would just be dumb to have so many class changes the same day a new raid tier drops. If it releases on the 10th it still gives people a week to relearn their class/rotation before NH. <br />
<br />
The only other option is that they are going to wait until AFTER NH releases. If this is the case, they better hope that NH keeps the interest because this xpac is sure shaping up to look a lot like WoD, IMO.</div></div><hr />

We're 4 months in, and lots of little things to fix classes still aren't done. IE Haiti, the hunter pet AI. I feel like they're putting a lot of pressure on themselves by only giving a week.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
