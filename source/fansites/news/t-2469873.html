<br />
Is there an actual date yet for when Zandalari and Kultirans will be available (finally)?<br />
I know it’s been a bit of a wait, especially for the Zandalari folks, but we just mentioned on the live stream that is diving into the art of WoW that it is the week of March 12.<br />
<br />
Is that patch 8.1.5 or just the new races?<br />
The Kul Tiran and Zandalari Allied Races are part of the 8.1.5 content update.</div></div><hr />

Like so many others I have to make other people see things for what they are. I have to make them see that everything is terrible, Vanilla is going to flop because it will have way too many changes. Warcraft 3 Remastered is destroying the game with its graphics update. Diablo is as good as dead the only thing they care about is Diablo Immortal. HoTS, Hearthstone, and Overwatch are on life support and the only reason they haven't yanked the plug on them is because the cables are tangled. Blizzard is a hollowed out corpse being puppeteered by Activision, gaming as a whole is dead. Consoles are trash and PC is dying because Mobile is replacing it.</div></div><hr />

It would take what, an hour to put together a simple web page saying 'Finally, your dreams of playing as a Zandalari or Kul Tiran come true, March 12th!&quot;? <br />

<br />
This is going places, &quot;real gaming&quot; is entirely subjective. If people are having a blast on mobile and spending loads of money there, you can call them sheep but that doesn't mean they're in the wrong - they're just enjoying something different to yourself.<br />
That companies in a currency based society will increase their efforts from where the money flows is only logical at that point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A NEW RAID, War campaign, brawlers guild, wod timewalking, wintergrasp epic bg, more micro holidays, updated darkmoon faire (and a lot of stuff gets remastered like wsg and ab, but I guess that's not really content)... I mean I do know that (or I hope at least that you know) you're being ironic n shit in a childish way, but yes, 8.1.5 does add new content. It's it is a minor patch, hence why it's a X.X.5 type patch (like 8.1.5 or 8.2.5)<br />

<br />
it's being made not with people in mind, but profits.<br />
<br />
there was always a money element, but most devs used to make games that they wanted to actually play.<br />
<br />
now, they make games for the mindless masses. made to goad money out of you however it can, rather than good enough for a living human to want to play. they know that the endless armies of the unfeeling subhumans will mindlessly consume as they've been taught.</div></div><hr />

I mean I do know that (or I hope at least that you know) you're being ironic n shit in a childish way, but yes, 8.1.5 does add new content. It's it is a minor patch, hence why it's a X.X.5 type patch (like 8.1.5 or 8.2.5)<br />
No, I'm not being ironic. 8.1.5 isn't a real patch. It's just a maintenance patch that unlocks the Allied Races. If there's more war campaign stuff it's still minimal content.<br />
<br />
If it was a real patch with actual content, it wouldn't be called 8.1.5<br />

<br />
there was always a money element, but most devs used to make games that they wanted to actually play.<br />
<br />
now, they make games for the mindless masses. made to goad money out of you however it can, rather than good enough for a living human to want to play. they know that the endless armies of the unfeeling subhumans will mindlessly consume as they've been taught.<br />
<br />
The main reason why the gaming industry appears to be so greedy nowadays is because players want their AAA games to be top notch at a price for 60-70$, which hasn't changed in more than a decade iirc. It's mostly the players' fault for expecting the prices to never go up, but have a constant increase of quality (and content).<br />
<br />
Of course there are also many other factors, but this is one of the main ones, that most people like to ignore.<br />

He said ACTUAL content though<br />

<br />
Like wtf is then actual content for you if it's none of that?!?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Again, because some people never seem to get it: No one is saying this is a major patch or anything, Blizzard is clear about it that it's a minor patch, but it does add content, no one fucking cares if you like this content or care about it. Some of you guys are pretending like you're being scammed by Blizz, cuz it's a small patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What fucking facts? Or do you mean &quot;alternative facts&quot;?<br />
<br />
It is a fact that 8.1.5 adds content (but not a lot, which no one ever said) and is not just a &quot;switch&quot; to let us play 2 new allied races. If you don't like it or care about it doesn't matter, facts don't have feelings ffs.<br />
<br />
As I said: It adds a new raid (Crucible of Storms), it adds a bunch of new world quests around the 2 continents, it adds more quests to the war campaign and there are various other questlines being added to the game, the brawlers guild is being unlocked again, Warlords of Draenor timewalking event, more micro holidays and many more stuff (including new rewards such as pets, mounts, updates to professions, updated models and zones, more darkmoon faire content...). <br />
<br />
I'm not gonna list you everything in detail that this patch adds, if you're not capable yourself to do any research then I don't really know what to say. Either way, not gonna get baited by you any longer. Learn to read and google.</div></div><hr />

Most likely in 8.2, however Nazjatar is definitely gonna be a non-flying area<br />

I stopped playing a few weeks after Battle of Azeroth. I've been playing World of Warcraft since release but this expansion has been really dull with so many artificial limitations and gating in-place to ensure slow progression in order to keep players spending longer time and keeping their subscriptions for longer periods of time that I just couldn't deal with it.<br />
<br />
The content patches so far haven't looked all that great so I've had zero reasons for picking the game up again. Sadly this patch doesn't seem to change things.<br />
<br />

I still read MMO-Champion because I still love Blizzard and World of Warcraft, I'm just waiting for new content that I might actually be interested in playing.</div></div><hr />

this game becomes more and more crap.<br />

dont get me wrong. i know nothing about you. maybe you played 4 years hardcore, took a break, and now be hyped by the style of zandalari and be happy to finally play a paladin. and play the game for the next year or so and have fun. which is totally fine and no offense here.<br />
<br />
but i have seen too much ppl, and the game became too much of a sort of an atractor for their cash grab systems. so many ppl out there hop in, to pay them for 2-3 months, leave money in shop and for tokens and race changes and leave forever. and blizzards reaction is to further support that cash grab system rotator instead making a good game for long term loyal customers, because first variant makes them more $$$ to feed their greed.<br />

let me check point for point that pseudo content blender list:<br />
<br />
CONTENT - Crucible of Storms. 2 bosses.<br />
CONTENT (for 1-2 hours). - War campaign? Yeah, 5 more quests?<br />
STYLE SHIT AND CASH GRAB The 2 new races have been delayed for how many months again?<br />
NOTHING Darkmoon Faire rollercoaster. Really?<br />
NOTHING New Micro Holidays. Do people really care about those?<br />
RECYLED SHIT WoD Time Walking. Because people loved WoD dungeons...<br />
QOL MICRO STUFF Portal room. Fucking finally? Should have been done 1 or 2 expansions ago.<br />

STYLE SHIT Remastered WSG and AB. Just reskins.<br />
PVP MINI FEATURE Brawl against AI. OMG!<br />
PVP MINI FEATURE Battle for WG. Because people loved this too<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
<br />
We get a lot of small cheap copy paste shit nobody cares about. Cheap recycled standard shit and a lot of style shit just to kitty catty ppl that leave money in their cash grab systems for tokens and race changes. besides that: Some cheap quests for 5-6 hours as REAL comtent and 2 raid bosses. no class changes, system changes, system features, warfront or island improvements at all.<br />
<br />
all in all we get 5 hours of quests and 2 raid bosses as content pve wise. great.<br />
<br />
i mean, ofc its a .5 patch. but, come on. even patches in cata had more to bring up. only WoD patch with selfie cam was more worse. <br />

That's up to you to decide obviously. My whole arguing point was that 8.1.5 is a minor content patch as it's been advertised, while 2 other guys were saying that this patch adds no content besides 2 new allied races (while implying that it should've been a major patch), which is clearly false.<br />
<br />
And just to clarify: The war campaign is way bigger than 5 more quests and there are other side questlines being added to the game. WoD is seen as a bad expansion because of the general direction where the game was going (mission table n shit) and how there wasn't really anything to do besides the typical content, but the dungeons and the raids were always praised. WoD has definitely one of the better dungeons they've added to the game. A raid with 2 bosses is still raid content and with 3.3.5 the only minor patch that adds a raid at all. And yes, I don't know what the fuck are you talking about, but people loved Wintergrasp (at least when your server was balanced). Adding Wintergrasp as an epic bg isn't only &quot;new&quot; content (because people stopped playing it when cata launched), but it's also gonna be the BEST version of this BG, because it's guaranteed to have an equal amount of players.<br />
<br />
<br />
With no timegates people could experience all of that in like 8 hours played. Seems more like content that can be experienced as a side dish when you have 1 or 2 hours of extra time when you resub for 8.2.0.<br />
<br />
That's the whole point of a X.X.5 patch. Working as intended and advertised.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Dunno if it's important to say, but I'm not currently subbed and BfA is the worst expansion by far imho. I'm just saying that some of the whining about 8.1.5 is riddiculous. It's a perfectly fine and solid patch of this kind.</div></div><hr />

If we use that line of thought, nazjatar is the equivalent of broken shore, so there should be flying, and whatever they add in 8.3 would not.<br />

No, I'm not being ironic. 8.1.5 isn't a real patch. It's just a maintenance patch that unlocks the Allied Races. If there's more war campaign stuff it's still minimal content.<br />
<br />
If it was a real patch with actual content, it wouldn't be called 8.1.5<br />
<br />

Sorry I more so meant the stuff that came with 8.1 (also minus dazar raid). Meaning the azerite adjustments, the new vendors, etc. <br />
<br />
BFA clearly released unfinished and horribly unpolished. 8.1 cleaned some of that up but it's a shame they rushed BFA out the door and thus wasting 8.1 on fixes and adjustments.</div></div><hr />

even 8.1 had alot of stuff like dark shore the incursions ect. the venders and stuff sure but other then that 8.1 had a ton of art assets and content.</div></div><hr />

The allied races all suck, nothing is fun, everything is terrible. Should just shut it all down, shutter the company and shoot the games in the back of the head like anything EA has touched.<br />
<br />
Hmmm yes you are right, Blizzard should just abandon one of their biggest money makers because you don't like the game anymore. :C<br />
<br />
Like yeah BFA isn't the greatest expansion, but it's not so bad that it can't be fixed lol. Also allied races are one of the good points about the game right now, it's one of the biggest selling points atm. <br />
<br />
Patch 8.1.5 has a lot of improvements to the game, and 8.2 will tackle the worst issue right now, how the Azerite armor works.<br />

Like so many others I have to make other people see things for what they are. I have to make them see that everything is terrible, Vanilla is going to flop because it will have way too many changes. Warcraft 3 Remastered is destroying the game with its graphics update. Diablo is as good as dead the only thing they care about is Diablo Immortal. HoTS, Hearthstone, and Overwatch are on life support and the only reason they haven't yanked the plug on them is because the cables are tangled. Blizzard is a hollowed out corpse being puppeteered by Activision, gaming as a whole is dead. Consoles are trash and PC is dying because Mobile is replacing it.<br />
<br />
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm sounds like you should take up a new hobby then boi.</div></div><hr />

The community needs more people like you (this is not sarcasm in any way)<br />
<br />
i didnt meant so. was not comparisson of timeline between Legion and BfA. just from the point of view WHAT they can do. they do not have to do it same as Legion, time wise. they could do what they want. so...<br />
<br />
i still believe nazjatar is non flying, while flying is enabled for pre 8.2 regions, when 8.2 hits.</div></div><hr />

They need to hurry up and get that shit to live!<br />
<br />
My guess is 2 weeks from now. <br />
<br />
Bow down to my amazing skills of prediction LMAO but seriously though it had to come soon cause any longer and they really will start to drive players away.<br />

<br />
Eewww...<br />
<br />
<br />
Not new content.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, I'm not being ironic. 8.1.5 isn't a real patch. It's just a maintenance patch that unlocks the Allied Races. If there's more war campaign stuff it's still minimal content.<br />
<br />
If it was a real patch with actual content, it wouldn't be called 8.1.5<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
Pretty much.<br />
<br />
Still not as bad as when they gated an entire zones story by 10-14 weeks or w/e but still....<br />
<br />
8.1.5 just brings nothing fresh or meaty to the table sadly. And the only meaty piece of content is timegated by a month.</div></div><hr />

7.2 &quot;Story&quot; - Kill 100 demons and come back next week for &quot;find 5 treasure chests&quot;. Thank god they had the mage tower because if it wasn't for that 7.2 might have been the worst patch ever made besides the Garrison patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
7.2 was a godawful patch. Gating a zones &quot;story&quot; by 3 months is disgusting.<br />
<br />
Tomb of Sargeras wasn't anything special either except for the last 2 fights. Not a bad raid but not amazing either.<br />
<br />
Tbh I think 7.2 was what made me make FF14 my full primary MMO and WoW my secondary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there was always a money element, but most devs used to make games that they wanted to actually play.<br />
<br />
now, they make games for the mindless masses. made to goad money out of you however it can, rather than good enough for a living human to want to play. they know that the endless armies of the unfeeling subhumans will mindlessly consume as they've been taught.<br />
<br />
So basically &quot;I dont like it so it is objectively bad&quot; is your stance. Good to know you're one of those entitled brats that thinks the whole world should cater to just him (or her).</div></div><hr />

&quot;You can now play the two Allied Races that are Allied with your factions since day one&quot;<br />
<br />
That's it ? Really ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And how is a raid, timewalking new mounts including the long awaited iron horde wolf, brawler's guild questline, war campaign, naga invasions and Xal'atath questline not ACTUAL content? What is your definition of new content? Because for me, an x.x.5 patch with all this content sounds pretty good.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chillside</div><div class="date">2019-03-04, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">blizzard should focus on making the spell-book and talent selection better on specs specifically subtlety. blizzard dropped the ball and the rpg aspect of the game. rogue needs to be a better experience. this is a selling point for me.<br />
<br />
I get that, sub isn't exactly the best at this point, but you have 2 more broken af specs to choose from, so stop that nonsense.<br />
<br />
I reckon we'll soon get locks complaining about having low damage output</div></div><hr />

<br />
Crucible of the Storms. But I guess that since it doesn't release on day 1 of the patch, it doesn't count, right?</div></div><hr />
