Blue Tweets<br />
PvE<br />
Personal Loot; The sad part is the amount of duplicate loots you get with it, if you could do something to that it would be better<br />
That's kinda just loot in general though, it's been that way since forever, in most RPGs. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601293679731564544))<br />
<br />
Will the 6.2 Personal Loot changes apply to LFR and world bosses or just premade groups?<br />
Yes to Raid Finder, but no plans for world bosses at this time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601454112765415424))<br />
<br />
are mythic dungeons going to be cross-realm?<br />
Yes. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601479203385663490))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
My eternally broken pet menagerie. 6.2 adding some awesome new pet battle content and my enthusiasm is rock bottom thanks to it.<br />
.We've been looking into a few of these issues in 6.2, if you can't get your menagerie working, please let me know! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601307683581464576))<br />
<br />
.Garrison missions for oil on the PTR seem really scarce... intended? Haven't seen one for 3 days<br />
Intended. Missions will not be your main source of Oil, just a rare bonus opportunity. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601452778616061953))<br />

Misc<br />
MMO Designer: What exactly do you want? Every player: TO ANNOY OTHER PEOPLE LOL (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601296025811288064))<br />
<br />
I'm just a dude, with a twitter, but I would very much like to hear what you think isn't being heard. I hear &quot;not listening&quot; a lot. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601300742704668672))<br />
Often report bugs I find in models. Reports I make dating 2 years ago seem to go unnoticed or low priority. http://t.co/NpiOQKqg7r<br />
The WoW DB has nearly 450,000 bugs total in its lifetime. Would like to fix every one timely, sometimes not possible, but recorded! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601309397382471681))<br />
Example: only recently did a bug get fixed where you are removed from your warrior stance when entering C'thun's stomach (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601310353159548928))<br />
<br />
At a certain point, you can't make a game and not care what the audience thinks. Every post or comment is taken to heart. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601304936622723072))<br />
Can you name anyone else at Blizzard that cares about what we think? Since you brought it up.<br />
Everyone. The WC books on the shelf behind me are so worn because so many new designers have read them all. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601312241783308289))<br />
<br />
the sad part is that there will always be those that, no matter how much you listen, will say you're not listening<br />
Such is the nature of social media The ability to yell at someone anytime, anywhere, about the lack of an Annoy-O-Tron pet. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601305175530274816))<br />
I think you're all listening, you just have a design philosophy that I disagree with (but I understand it, I think)<br />
I don't know if you disagree with me, or the design team, but go ahead and tell me more! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601307495550812160))<br />
<br />
your problem is that you asked what they want. just make the awesome game and ignore every1 else<br />
Often, making &quot;awesome&quot; in a vacuum results in the realization that it's not so great for someone else (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601306011518038017))<br />
<br />
People are heard, they are just not told &quot;we heard you but... yay or nay&quot; back. So they don't know.<br />
It's difficult to respond with a community of this size, even with a community team. A challenge! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601309845963317249))<br />
<br />
mobile content. I feel like there's just a TON of missed opportunities to have mobile games that tie into the mmo gameplay.<br />
Hearthstone did awesome. I think there is still significant meaning in being a Blizzard product. Thus, need to be careful. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601303750263836673))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
PvP<br />
I'm not sure if you can answer this or not but as a pvper, I'm curious. How much weight did PvP balance actually play in WoW?<br />
A lot. In some sense if you tune a game around PvP, the PvE can flow from that. Monsters don't mind getting nerfed. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599976480890716161))<br />
PvP is harder to test though. Fighting a boss 10 times is a decent sample size. It's nothing for a PvP match. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599976751834398720))<br />
<br />
Amount of Content<br />
Very curious as to your take on Watcher's interview.<br />
Ion's a good friend of mine. I'm not about to throw him under the bus. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599279777510400000))<br />
No bus here, just curiosity. Do you think &quot;it's cyclical&quot; is a good or even fair way to summate it tho?<br />
Yes. Players come for content and leave when they run out. &quot;But I should never run out of content,&quot; feels unrealistic to me. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599302773708967936))<br />
I do think / know the challenges of creating content faster than players can consume it are very real. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599279937002975233))<br />
Neverending content leads to making things so difficult you can't progress or asking you to run the same content 100 times. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599303016043261952))<br />
Is there something to be said for the staying power of the content? Or implementing it in a way that allows for a medium?<br />
If there were 40 boss raids, maybe. I get tired of killing the same ones over and over no matter how great they are. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599349431482191872))<br />
Like the PvP content WoW neglects? Is your current job not 100% repeatable content now?<br />
IMO repeatable content is a PvE construct. PvP has a lot of variation because of the players involved. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599975884905254913))<br />
We do add new content, champions being the prime example, but there is less of a burden on a PvP game, again IMO. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599976048168579072))<br />
<br />
Heroes of the Storm<br />
hi what do you think about heros of the strom compare to LoL?<br />
I think they are wisely going for a different kind of moba which makes sense in a crowded market. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599975411599020032))<br />
I think they have a chance to broaden the moba audience, which may be good for everyone. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599975545548328961))<br />

too lazy to build a new model..?<br />

also, the felsteel annihilator may be a fun mount since it is essentially the sky golem (which IS a fun mount!), but it is only another skin and that is also sad. :(</div></div><hr />

I don't know what mount you are on about, I don't think the boar can fly at all. The annihilator also doesn't look like flying type of mount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Direhorn animations.<br />
<br />
Which is just weird since they have perfectly acceptable, if not straight-up good boar animations for their actual boar mobs. They have an adorable run animation already, as ungainly as a hell-pig should be, and I'd proudly ride a mighty hog running so derpily... but no. We have to get the ground-humping Direhorn animations, totally inappropriate for something without a massive tail.</div></div><hr />

Reskin? It's an entirely new model, its not like they just took the sky golem and put a new texture on it. Unless you mean it has the same animation set as the sky golem, but its just silly to expect every single model they make have its own rig and custom animations.

<br />
Fanboy or not, he is actually right.You can't expect every single mount to have a different animation, even the mount shop has the same animations as other available mounts, just a different skin.<br />
<br />
The boar on the other end is just stupid...it looks like nowadays faction mounts can just have a different color and that's it, a few daily quests and a stupid recolored mount sure means more content.</div></div><hr />

Releasing as in-game a recolored mount that has shitty animations.<br />
<br />
Why not, most other mounts are reskinned as well. It's the same as cash shop mounts and they make bank off of those.<br />

I really don't understand what people are expecting of Blizzard when they've been doing the same half-assed shit for years. lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem here is that they focus on WoW ONLY. Why call it a &quot;MMO&quot; website while they focus only on one game? And don't say &quot;but they have forum pages from other games bla bla bla&quot;....2/3 of forums are about WoW. the rest are off topic and other MMOs or MOBAs.<br />
<br />
I made a mistake. They shouldn't change it to &quot;WoW-Champion&quot; but to &quot;Blizzard-Champion&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're usually delayed, or probs won't talk about it until it actually becomes F2P.<br />
They do talk about other MMOs (I'm fairly sure I saw a Wildstar post within the last 2-4 weeks.<br />
<br />
And no I'm not defending it, I agree, but Curse does what it wants.</div></div><hr />

If you only had to do a boss 3 times to get all the loot relevant to you, then this game would be dead. (More dead than the doomsayers already think it is.) People just want things handed to them these days...<br />
Maybe I'm taking their complaint to the extreme, and they didn't mean exactly that, but that's all I could gather in those 140 characters.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's infuriating... I actually really like the frost one from the stables and looks great with my death knight - until the fucking thing moves. It's so bad I can't bear using it.<br />
<br />
I can't believe for a moment the artists that worked on it are happy with the way the animations work.</div></div><hr />

One really do wonder...... If you ask me, pretty much all WoD model mounts got crappy running animations.... Boars are just the worst. It is so bad that I seriously question if anyone of them actually have seen an animal move even once in their entire life.</div></div><hr />

FTFY. I wonder when we're going to get new mount models in-game that aren't buggy and don't have to be bought on the cash-shop.<br />

It shows how much they care about this expansion and/or WoW in general.+</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rivin</div><div class="date">2015-05-29, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Direhorn animations.<br />
<br />
Which is just weird since they have perfectly acceptable, if not straight-up good boar animations for their actual boar mobs. They have an adorable run animation already, as ungainly as a hell-pig should be, and I'd proudly ride a mighty hog running so derpily... but no. We have to get the ground-humping Direhorn animations, totally inappropriate for something without a massive tail.<br />
<br />
The problem is that it's an NPC model skeleton, not a mount skeleton. It's the same reason they used the terrible old worg mount skeleton for the new Draenor wolves, even though the Draenor wolf NPCs have way better animations. The skeleton needs attachment points for riders and whatever else a mount needs that the NPC doesn't (/mountspecial animations, maybe?).<br />
<br />
I don't know how much work adding those attachment points to skeletons would be, but obviously Blizzard thought it wasn't worth the time. Even though they really should've done it anyway. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

I agree. I remember a time not too long away in which video game companies cared about the quality of their product and it wasn't all about appeasing the shareholders and lining your pockets.</div></div><hr />

It is a Fel Reaver Iron Horde version, and the original Fel Reaver is literally a machine powered by fel energy and held together by magic - and Iron Horde technology comes from Blackfuse (the merc Goblin that worked for Garrosh on SoO), so the Archimonde mount and Iron Reaver Boss is a evil shredder powered with fel magic from hell with a goblin engineering touch lol</div></div><hr />

Well the raid boss that uses that model does fly. <br />
<br />
That's at least more than you can say about Blackfuse's mech golem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rofl, Blizzard fanboy alert, Blizzard fanboy alert. Oh gosh, please, DO NOT make Blizzard work, it's not like they are being paid for it, right? RIGHT? New model so much work oh noes, just eat this rehash and keep getting ripped off lol, some people never cease to amaze me<br />
<br />
I actually defy you to name a game that doesn't reuse animations for anything.<br />
<br />
Well, I already know the answer is you can't name one, because that's too expensive. Even the new Mortal Kombat shares animations here and there even when the ninjas aren't palette-swaps anymore.</div></div><hr />
