Overwatch Short Tomorrow<br />
Don't forget to check back tomorrow at 12 p.m. PDT for the first Overwatch Short, Recall! It tells the story of Winston, including his thoughts and memories as he wrestles with the decision to recall the agents of Overwatch, all while the forces of Talon stage an attack on his laboratory in the abandoned Watchpoint: Gibraltar. <br />

Hate to be that player, but the only problem I have with Legion rn is that fire mages have mandatory frost spells/talents. X_x<br />
Seen feedback in both directions. &quot;I'm a fire mage, I only want fire spells&quot; &amp; &quot;I'm a Mage I should be able to use all schools&quot; (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/706629222941351936))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Please do not force LFR on players (for the artifact upgrade questline). At least let them do Normal Raiding in place of LFR.<br />
You can do it in other difficulties, LFR/LFG is just an option for players without premade groups. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/707005012015063041))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
I'm kinda surprised, devs didn't take lessons learned from dungeon finder and lfr when they made ashran.<br />
Different situation when direct competition is involved. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/706967683363831812))<br />
<br />
Will the arena also function in the actual zone? Like free-for-all Nagrand arena in outland Nagrand? Would be nice!<br />
No. This location in the world is used by the Feral Druid artifact acquisition line and will not function as such. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/707657635017822208))<br />
<br />
the new arena looks amazing. Did Julien work on it?<br />
Yup Chris and Julien collaborated on it and did a great job! (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/708687971994574848))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Are Horde players going to get an option to fire back at Tyrande's insults in Val'Sharah, like the Alliance had with Vol'jin?<br />
The dialogue in the beta got a lot of deservedly negative feedback, it's being changed! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/708003663390703616))<br />
<br />
Pets and Pet Battles<br />
So there might be 'collector content' but not so much 'battler content', which will upset one side. Or vice versa. Tough to find a balance.<br />
I think that both groups both can and should be satisfied, the game is richer for having both, and cross-pollination. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/706294868855779328))<br />

<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
It has been 2 years already? Man I still remember Riot announcing you joining their company and everyone being scared of Lissandra Nerfs <br />
They actually introduced me around the office as the person who would focus on buffing Lissandra. For the record, my frost mage in WoW was like level 32 or so. Not sure she ever PvP'd. It was just an urban legend.<br />

Tbh for a weird mix up they could make Frostfire bolt deal fire damage in fire spec and frost in frost? I mean it sounds stupid but just a thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems they just got overwhelmed with the difficulties of integrating live actors with such heavy CGI characters and effects. In this trailer you can really see that the human actors are filmed in front of a green screen that get's turned into CGI. It's jarring. And it comes off as cheap even though it cost a fortune.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can see a few exceptions (e.g. there isn't really a better way to stop an enemy dead in its tracks than a good old Frost Nova even if you're not specialising in Frost), but these should be rare and definitely not in the rotations.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, aside from the aforementioned exceptions, each spec has a very strong opinion on what is the best solution for any particular problem. For example, when it comes to dealing with a massive blow, Frost mages say you should Ice Block while Fire mages prefer to take the hit and Cauterize the wound. Long story short, whenever possible, and it usually is, Mages should prefer their own specialty to other mages. You want someone who can use both ice and fire at once? Go ask a shaman</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I compare this shot between the one in the previous trailer, I think they used an unfinished shot in this one, probably a mistake from the editor.<br />
<br />
This trailer : http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/march/WCMHalo03.jpg<br />
Previous : http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/march/WCMTw02.jpg<br />
<br />
The face is more detailed in the previous teaser, and everything looks more polished, so I guess this new shot is not the final one.</div></div><hr />

to be fair a mage with fire frost and arcane abilities all mixed together would be really cool<br />
<br />
And I want to be able to use all spell schools in any spec, just with a different impact / efficience depending on speciality. No one forces you to use cone of cold if you are fire and have a better dragon's breath (which shares CD). But it is sometimes handy to have a aoe slow instead of an aoe stun, so you would have a choice.<br />
<br />
If you want to play a toon with 5 abilities, there is HotS for you. RPGs have a main feature about them that you have many abilities and use some of them as a standard kit (depending on your spec) and use others occasionally. Anything else is just hack &amp; slay or MOBA.</div></div><hr />

So, wanna back other offensive abilities like (fireball, scorch, arcane blast) when my frost spec was interupted. So i hope mr. HOLINKA... do it.</div></div><hr />

Ghostcrawler is the reason WoW lost so many subs. He has no idea about playing WoW or developing WoW. Check the numbers before GC and After GC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not really, most people with more than half a braincell know as fact that the reason WoW went so far downhill was the gradual introduction of bad features and no introduction of good features.<br />
<br />
Bad features?<br />
<br />
LFD - makes dungeons a waiting-game/chore/loot-machine with zero social aspect.<br />
LFR - makes raiding a waiting-game/chore/loot-machine with zero social aspect.<br />
City Portals - Gets rid of world traveling, outwith flying/collecting/leveling<br />
Flying - turned exploration into: &quot;Afk at point X, head in the direction of course Z, come back in 10 minutes&quot;<br />
New character models - rushed, unfinished, ruined some charm and history.<br />
Timeless Isle - free loot/grind-island, not real content.<br />
Class identity scrapping - every ability now feels the same, and doesn't feel like it hits hard.<br />
continously poorly designed/rehashed gear. - 3 recolors of most gears/mounts.<br />
Simplification of questing/the world/leveling - ruined the entire leveling experience, millions left.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good features that could've been introduced?<br />
<br />
New Skeleton rigging - most mobs in the game share rigging, it makes the models seem cheap.<br />
Physics - any level of physics based destruction or rag-doll would've significantly increased the longevity of WoW<br />
Class tutoring - the ability to learn abilities from other classes outwith current limitations.<br />
Ironman - when you die you're gone forever, but tons more experience. <br />
Raid-based leveling system - Can level up via slaying difficult bosses with friends for much better experience.<br />
An actual arena - betting/can watch other players etc, a real arena.<br />
Timeless Raiding - instead of LFR, a system where you're taught raid encounters in a more controlled environment, in order to master boss mechanics.</div></div><hr />

New Skeleton rigging - most mobs in the game share rigging, it makes the models seem cheap.<br />
Physics - any level of physics based destruction or rag-doll would've significantly increased the longevity of WoW<br />
Class tutoring - the ability to learn abilities from other classes outwith current limitations.<br />
Ironman - when you die you're gone forever, but tons more experience. <br />
Raid-based leveling system - Can level up via slaying difficult bosses with friends for much better experience.<br />
An actual arena - betting/can watch other players etc, a real arena.<br />
Timeless Raiding - instead of LFR, a system where you're taught raid encounters in a more controlled environment, in order to master boss mechanics.<br />
<br />
Lol lfg ruined stuff, ok you know you can still form groups by yourself and go to the dungeon instead of using lfg? Also how did leveling get ruined? low level without heirlooms is fun if you don't do dungeons that is because otherwise it's still a rushfest with everyone who has heirlooms, sure it's not boring and slow like back in vanilla but still, also you don't want timeless isle because it feels like a grindfest? well all of vanilla was a grindfest and so was tbc.<br />
<br />
Also ironman? so how would you ever raid? that's like the dumbest idea ever since you will wipe a lot even in new dungeons. And class identity? well first off they're changing a lot in legion and second off, i play a lot of specs on alts for example and i always feel like i'm playing a different spec i think it's just another ridiculous thing that started in wod because it's cool to hate wod<br />
<br />
You say blizz thinks of bad features, well please do not become a dev yourself because your game would probably suck</div></div><hr />

GC was a dev in wrath when it hit the highest sub numbers at 12.5 million, im not a GC fan or anything but just saying<br />

This movie baffles me. <br />
<br />
The trailer makes it look and feel like a children's movie, yet the WoW playerbase is all grown up now. <br />
<br />
Who the hell is this movie for??<br />
<br />
dnt like it dnt watch it simple<br />

Its already 2 years since GC left? It feels like it has only been a year, time flies by so fast...<br />
<br />
I do think his tweets are way overdue by now, he's not even up to date with WoW anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
mmo-c will do anything to fill there frontpage with content same with wowhead, i think wowhead is worse than GC tweets on mmo champion because there always showing off pepe and clothes and shit, is wowhead a wow fansite or a fucking fashion store i dunno</div></div><hr />

Do not force people to do lfr for atifact? Blizzard isnt forceing you to do LFR for legendary, your just a lazy a×× person who rather do LFR than PUG or your in a crappy GUILD who cant out progress LFR's release window, no one to blame but you. Should of ask the question that was really on your mind, &quot;Can you stop giving people who use LFR gear&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blankfaced</div><div class="date">2016-03-21, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see a few exceptions (e.g. there isn't really a better way to stop an enemy dead in its tracks than a good old Frost Nova even if you're not specialising in Frost), but these should be rare and definitely not in the rotations.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, aside from the aforementioned exceptions, each spec has a very strong opinion on what is the best solution for any particular problem. For example, when it comes to dealing with a massive blow, Frost mages say you should Ice Block while Fire mages prefer to take the hit and Cauterize the wound. Long story short, whenever possible, and it usually is, Mages should prefer their own specialty to other mages. You want someone who can use both ice and fire at once? Go ask a shaman<br />
<br />
Your frost nova is a good example, but then what of the out of combat abilities that make zero sense as anything other than arcane. I always perceived specialization as something a bit different than others. I thought of it not as if I just focus on one school ignoring the rest my whole life, but that I started out a mage using multiple schools and then started putting more focus on a specific school as I progressed. So you learn a lot of basics from the other schools but are much more capable at your specialized school. I really feel in the lore of it all, no mage would ever forsake the other schools just be a &quot;Fire Mage.&quot; It would be limiting them to an unnecessary degree just to look cool?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. Why should we play shamans to use different MAGE schools? Even with all the recent pruning, we kept our various utility and combat spells from other schools, at least from arcane (invisibility, polymorph, blink, conjure food, teleportation, portals). My concept of being a MAGE is constantly diminished by the increasing restrictions of available spells. This is not class fantasy anymore, its spec fantasy. Take a look at the D&amp;D wizard class - don't matter their preferred school, they are all wizards, they can potentially cast all spells they know, but some will be more effective than others. This is what I expect from a MAGE in WoW. Especially if we will get a triple-spec character. The pruning model of reducing your kit of spells depeding on your spec by default is like having a partial amnesia - because these spells will magically reappear in your character when you switch to another spec.<br />
<br />
Specialisation should be about the effectiveness of some spells, and possibly some additional flavour spells (like D&amp;D sorceror breeds have), not a schizophrenic split of all available spells into 3 different personalities. To come back to my D&amp;D comparison: We all started with playing Wizards, and will have to play Sorcerers in Legion, forced by Blizzard on us. I like my mage to be a master of magic, not a master of one third of all abilities depending on the state of my character's mind.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why movies keep doing this. Like the new marvel civil war trailer.... why show spider man in the trailer...... Wouldn't it have been cooler to have him pop up IN the movie and everyone seeing if would go OMG spiderman.... rather than now.. its oh... there's spider man...<br />

The sad thing is that your absolutely right! It really does look like its from photoshop.<br />
It might just be some unlucky screenshots of the tv-spot we will have to wait till the final release of the movie to see how it actually is.</div></div><hr />

Thing is a lot of the casual movie going crowd tend to prefer more of the movie given away from trailers and don't much like going into things completely blind. They like to know what they're in for. For those casual moviegoers seeing Spiderman in a trailer makes them flip their shit and want to see it more, whereas for the bigger fans of the Marvel movies already knew Spiderman would be in Civil War. I myself like that Spiderman was revealed in the trailer, already knowing he was in the movie long ago.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I don't think that's an invernal.<br />
Most of that thing looks like it was made of clay, so more likely to be a golem enchanted with fell magic.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for info but game got popular enough during Bc which also effected wotlk. And remember how many months we played Naxx again in wrath which is a work of previous people. Oh and look what happened to arena pvp :(<br />
Cata showed what he is.<br />
<br />

Come on Blizz, are you even trying anymore? WAKE UP.<br />

Not really, most people with more than half a braincell know as fact that the reason WoW went so far downhill was the gradual introduction of bad features and no introduction of good features.<br />
<br />
Bad features?<br />
<br />
LFD - makes dungeons a waiting-game/chore/loot-machine with zero social aspect.<br />
LFR - makes raiding a waiting-game/chore/loot-machine with zero social aspect.<br />
City Portals - Gets rid of world traveling, outwith flying/collecting/leveling<br />
Flying - turned exploration into: &quot;Afk at point X, head in the direction of course Z, come back in 10 minutes&quot;<br />
New character models - rushed, unfinished, ruined some charm and history.<br />
Timeless Isle - free loot/grind-island, not real content.<br />
Class identity scrapping - every ability now feels the same, and doesn't feel like it hits hard.<br />
continously poorly designed/rehashed gear. - 3 recolors of most gears/mounts.<br />
Simplification of questing/the world/leveling - ruined the entire leveling experience, millions left.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good features that could've been introduced?<br />
<br />
New Skeleton rigging - most mobs in the game share rigging, it makes the models seem cheap.<br />
Physics - any level of physics based destruction or rag-doll would've significantly increased the longevity of WoW<br />
Class tutoring - the ability to learn abilities from other classes outwith current limitations.<br />
Ironman - when you die you're gone forever, but tons more experience. <br />
Raid-based leveling system - Can level up via slaying difficult bosses with friends for much better experience.<br />
An actual arena - betting/can watch other players etc, a real arena.<br />
Timeless Raiding - instead of LFR, a system where you're taught raid encounters in a more controlled environment, in order to master boss mechanics.<br />
<br />
Now please use that any 1 cell to think who should implement any features to the game and what does a Lead Designer do in WoW. You didn't hear? Blizz is still hiring people so they can introduce features.<br />
<br />
And i don't agree with you.</div></div><hr />

I see your point. I guess that's why titanic did so well. We already knew the ship was going to sink.</div></div><hr />
