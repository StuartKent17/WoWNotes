<br />
02:40 CET - Added Glyphs changes in class changes. <br />
02:25 CET - Added a very important about honor reset in WotLK at the top of the page. <br />
02:15 CET - Skills and Talents list are now up to date. <br />
02:00 CET - Added Death Knight changes, also a new spell for hunters it seems. <br />
<br />
<br />
No Honor reset at the release of WotLK<br />
We had hoped that the introduction of some new Honor rewards in the upcoming patch would give players a great opportunity to spend any of their remaining Honor. However, many players would still be surprised by an Honor and token reset as it isn’t something we’ve done in the past. As such, we've decided to not reset Honor or tokens upon the release of Wrath of the Lich King. Players who save their Honor will be able to spend it on level 80 rewards, although those rewards will be significantly more expensive than their level 70 counterparts. <br />

So long to what was quite possibly the only really fun change to the Paladin's Holy tree. Its back to standing still and spamming Flash of Light again, mobility is gone. I was even reserving judgement on the way holy paladin survivability for PvP was totally gutted, bubble being penetrated by every second class, blessing of sacrifice totally nerfed, rank1 consecration gone. It made some sense to give up survivability in PvP for mobility but now that the mobility is gone there isn't much left. <br />

<br />
I can't see any purpose whatsoever to the spell. In BGs the odds of a player surviving for 1 minute while curse of doom ticks away and still being within range of the warlock when he does die so they can enslave the thing are miniscule. In PvE, grinding normal mobs they won't take a minute to die making curse of doom a waste of time, on boss fights the odds of the curse of doom delivering the killing blow are also remote, nevermind the very crappy proc chance if it does happen to do the killing blow. <br />
<br />
The only time most warlocks even used the spell trying to summon was when somebody asked them to summon a doomguard just to see and they have prevented it. The spell used be able to proc from mobs that gave no experience or honor, now that is removed.<br />
<br />
Not really worth complaining though, it's just funny that they nerf that side affect in a manner that pretty much prevents the only actual use it ever had even though that use was just a gimmick to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whine whine whine, make sure you're up to EVERY updates to the ever changing beta.<br />
Here are the last TWO changes made to Curse of Doom:<br />
<br />
Curse of Doom now summons a Doomguard only if the target yields experience or honor.<br />
(Source (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=16691.0))<br />
Curse of Doom now gives 100% chance to spawn a doomguard if the target dies to curse of doom.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other than that, check the new tooltip:<br />
<br />
Curses the target with impending doom, causing 7300 Shadow damage after 1 min. If the target yields experience or honor when it dies from this damage, a Doomguard will be summoned. Cannot be cast on players.<br />
So this change is a good one. Warlocks can't go around, throw CoD on a critter and see a Doomguard spawn 1min after.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldn't find the post, must be wrong, Vitality has 6 expertise now, guess I sorta remember that, hard to keep track of the changes soo many builds.<br />
However most of these changes, are still a build or two off.<br />
<br />
'As promised, here are a few dps changes. There will probably be a few more over the next few days. <br />
<br />
Fury <br />
<br />
Unending Fury changed to increase damage of Slam, Whirlwind and Bloodthirst by 2/4/6/8/10% (it no longer offers a rage discount). <br />
<br />
Arms <br />
<br />
Sudden Death now grants 10 rage, so that following the Execute you have 10 rage left over. In the course of testing this, we also decided Execute by itself wasn't doing enough damage, so it got a buff too (could be around +15%), which will also help the talent. <br />
<br />
Bladestorm breaks roots and snares when initially used. It doesn't break other forms of CC, largely because we suspect that if it did, that functionality in PvP would overshadow the actual cool whirlwindy part. <br />
<br />
Strength of Arms now grants 2%/2%/2 Str/Sta/Expertise per point. (Still 2 points total'</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reminds me of a story I read in college many years ago.<br />
When the government of a certain country decided to support local farm produce in favor of imported farm produce, the US Government leaned on them to keep their markets open. So they did, they just installed new regulations requiring imported food to be tested. Enforcement of this testing took time; by the time imported food had passed inspection, it had been rotting on the docks for weeks.<br />
<br />
I guess this is one way to reduce the number of classes in WoW.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, congratulations. Thanks to all you QQ'ers, the level 80 gear will likely be priced much higher than their level 70 counterparts.<br />
<br />
To those of us who don't have 75k Honor and 100 marks from each BG, resetting all is a nice fresh start FOR ALL. Those who do have max honor and marks, must have a severe case of a superiority complex.</div></div><hr />

If you really think that these people are unfairly getting skill through welfarez, then prove them incompetent, by getting the same gear and owning them with it (because you are supposedly the one with all the skill (which I am not saying is or is not true)).</div></div><hr />

<br />
i am always optimistic when it comes to this , but what is happening now is just really sad..... , i really think the shaman class will die... if its not changed soon, there wont be any shamans left trust me! , it seemed they were finnaly making enhance a little bit better to compete with other classes but atm they just nerfed it to hell again , as for resto , shamans still have so much problems with mp5 atm , u can say what u like but if a fully tier 6 geared shaman goes oom in a lvl 74 dungeon each boss fight while using a pot .... then im starting to wonder whats going on....<br />
<br />
its sad but im also considering rerolling now unless they make some serious changes....</div></div><hr />

I know, I honestly don't want to play my hunter until WotLK now, and that's saying a lot.<br />
<br />
What does MM have now at 70? The choice between chimera shot or scatter shot? Honestly Blizz? It's comparable to surv specing for arena at 70, are you honestly going to take readiness over scatter shot? Because DR completely destroys wyvern sting.<br />
<br />
So let's recap, we get bear trap, which would be a counter to warriors in arena as the dot effect causes arena rot and doesn't allow them to regain any health through second wind. Then they got rid of it, and decide instead to give freezing trap a chance to break on damage. Was nice when a healing partner is dotted and runs into the trap, at least it didn't go to waste, as it does in its current (2.4) form. Now we're back to square one.<br />
<br />
But no, it's cool blizzard, MM has readiness now, so I'll be able to trap twice every 3 minutes, save for the fact that they can no longer have any dots on them, and it will suffer from DR.<br />
<br />
MM survivability is now non-existent. I guess it was time for MM to go from a pvp exclusive spec to a pve exclusive spec.<br />

Also, does the change to maelstrom weapon provoke any WF/WF usage again over the WF/FT? I really don't care which i'm using atm, but would the dps decrease (?) be made up from the extra WF hits, which equal to the extra chances for Maelstrom to proc? Right now on the ptr it's very &quot;twitchy&quot; as far as proccing. getting one proc them NEVER getting another during 30 seconds of combat is fucking ridiculous, while in other situations i have a stack almost as fast as i did when it was crit based, but lasts twice as long.<br />

And again good work blizz, more buffs to protection warrior. Both druid and warrior(who has aoe tanking) got some extra aoe tanking tools. Except druids got a nerf for their dmg reduction talent.

<br />
Did you even test it? I for one did several times and although it can't stack it CAN be refreshed with the highest hot. For instance, you crit and the HoT is around 700 per 3 seconds (that's about what I got on every crit) and then you keep flashing refreshing the HoT and the hot keeps it's 700 per 3 seconds. The glyph is actually pretty amazing but maybe too good considering this probably isn't a bug and is intended.<br />
<br />
I've already done some testing and it's a significant decrease in the HoT but I'll still use it. With the nerf to Infusion of LIght I can only wonder if something really good is coming now to rebalance us. Usually nerfs come with something good thrown in to balance...it's like you can't have this anymore but we'll give you this to make up for it.<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
I think you don't really understand what it means.<br />
<br />
Assume that a FoL hit for X with a C % crit. (0&lt;C&lt;1)<br />
<br />
So on average, without the glyph a FoL hit for : X * (1 + 0.5 * C)<br />
<br />
With the Glyph on average :<br />
- the first part can crit so it heals on average for : 0.5 * X * (1 + 0.5 * C)<br />
- the hot part cannot crit so it heals for : 1.4 * X<br />
<br />
In the end, (Glyphed FoL - Unglyphed FoL) = 0.9 * X - 0.25 * C *X = ( 0.9 - 0.25 * C)* X<br />
<br />
So the Glyphed FoL ALWAYS heals for more than the UnGlyphed FoL. With a 33% crit rate (C=0.33), the first one heals for 80% more than the latter.<br />
<br />
Pretty good glyph actually.</div></div><hr />

I for one did several times and although it can't stack it CAN be refreshed with the highest hot. For instance, you crit and the HoT is around 700 per 3 seconds (that's about what I got on every crit) and then you keep flashing refreshing the HoT and the hot keeps it's 700 per 3 seconds. The glyph is actually pretty amazing but maybe too good considering this probably isn't a bug and is intended.<br />
<br />
I've already done some testing and it's a significant decrease in the HoT but I'll still use it. With the nerf to Infusion of LIght I can only wonder if something really good is coming now to rebalance us. Usually nerfs come with something good thrown in to balance...it's like you can't have this anymore but we'll give you this to make up for it.<br />
<br />
I'm not QQ'ing until the patch is live....and better yet when WOTLK is in my hands =)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you don't really understand what it means.<br />
<br />
Assume that a FoL hit for X with a C % crit. (0&lt;C&lt;1)<br />
<br />
So on average, without the glyph a FoL hit for : X * (1 + 0.5 * C)<br />
<br />
With the Glyph on average :<br />
- the first part can crit so it heals on average for : 0.5 * X * (1 + 0.5 * C)<br />
- the hot part cannot crit so it heals for : 1.4 * X<br />
<br />
In the end, (Glyphed FoL - Unglyphed FoL) = 0.9 * X - 0.25 * C *X = ( 0.9 - 0.25 * C)* X<br />
<br />
So the Glyphed FoL ALWAYS heals for more than the UnGlyphed FoL. With a 33% crit rate (C=0.33), the first one heals for 80% more than the latter.<br />
<br />
Pretty good glyph actually.<br />
<br />
First let me correct that messy calculation...<br />
<br />
glypth FoL = gFoL<br />
normal FoL = nFoL<br />
x = a nFoL heal without crit<br />
<br />
avarage nFoL w crit = x + x / 2 * c<br />
avarage initial gFoL w crit = z + z / 2 * c<br />
where z = x / 2<br />
<br />
Thus initial heal of gFoL will always, surprisingly, be 50% of nFoL crits or no crits.<br />
Alas gFoL with the HoT where y = a average nFoL heal with crit;<br />
<br />
y/2 + y/2 * 1,4 = (0,5y) + (0,5y * 1,4) = 0,5y + 0,7y = 1,2y<br />
<br />
Thus the total healing of gFoL if the HoT is allowed to tick full out will always be 20% more than nFoL no matter +heal and +crit.<br />
Let me quote my first post;<br />
<br />
<br />
...making the total amount healed just 20% more than a direct FoL...<br />
Now I was a bit weak with what I meant in the end of my first post and looking back at it it looks like I meant nFoL would have added healing from crit. But what I meant was that the nature of paladin healing with allot of crits means that a mere recast of gFoL, let's say, every 10sec, which is quite abnormal for a spam heal, would probably yield the same or less raw healing for the same amount of mana as nFoL.<br />
<br />
And yes meroko, I have tested it in the beta (have it equiped right now) and yes it still sucked ass in it's old form simply because the HoT didn't stack making it an extremely situational heal which us is too narrow in its uses. Now if it was a new heal that didn't take away the normal FoL it would be more useful but considering the loss of our all purpose spam heal it's just bad in general and not worth it.<br />
<br />
They can still fix it though by making the HoT stack, especially after making the HoT way less powerfull.</div></div><hr />

For a few builds, it gave 3% starting with the first point, the only thing that was boosted by additional points was the attack power. Obviously a bug that was fixed now.</div></div><hr />

Hunters for you ::) Honor will scale a lot more at 80 so it'll be like grinding for 75k at 70, no more, no less. Just means people with 75k get 1-2 extra items or maybe not even that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Twice as hard? or twice the fun? No one forces you to get all that gear. The game isn't a job, Blizzard isn't forcing you get anything in the game. I think a lot of you don't realize this. If you think it's boring, don't do it? Don't enjoy the game? Stop play it?</div></div><hr />

Actually, I do hope it won't scale enough to match the new costs, looking at how ridiculously easy it was to grind some really good gear (even in PvE, for some classes/talent builds)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anywho, where are all the glyphs? With a few exceptions, nearly all of them I see are mediocre at best. I understand they're not supposed to make sweeping changes, or anything, but there are quite a few classes/specs that don't have any that would be useful to them. Just sayin...<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, with the upcoming live content patch, are all of the huge changes to gear itemization, STR-&gt;BV, and all that nonsense taking place, or will that be released with WotLK? Just wondering what kind of gear I should be picking up for the next month and a half. Yeah, I know it won't matter then, but I play the game for fun, and enjoy raiding and collecting gear. :3</div></div><hr />

Innerfire will grant spellpower in WOTLK, so improved Innerfire will grant even more spellpower. Hence you pick it up as a holy or shadowpriest.</div></div><hr />

A burst of Holy energy fills the caster, increasing armor by 2440 and spell power by 120. Each melee or ranged damage hit against the priest will remove one charge. Lasts 10 min or until 20 charges are used.<br />

for those who wonder why a nerf at 70 but a buff at 80 fair and simple, at 70 your gear has int AKA T4, T5, T6 and all arena gear. at 80 ret paladin neither tier nor arena gear has int on it.</div></div><hr />

I just want to know what Soul Fire is for at the moment.<br />
I mean, now we have a new spell that's fire based like SF, have a slight cooldown and costs no soul shard.<br />
So, what's the point of having soul fire now? Has it ever had a real utility?<br />
Anyway, i still think that the 51 point talent in the destruction tree is something redundant.<br />
I would have had something that just adjusted SF cast time and effects to what chaos bolt is now, removing its soul shard requirements, letting it be a useful spell.</div></div><hr />

Generally PvE'ers do not want to PvP. They know it's not hard, which is why they whine. It is easy for a PvP'er to get welfare epics and then be decent at PvE.

Signed - t6 Frost raiding Mage<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually I am a raider and I wanted Deep Freeze nerfed for PVE too. Anything that nerfs mages of any spec in PVE, I'm happy about. :P Bastards were going to to as much DPS as me again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No mitigation vs. Mitigation.<br />
<br />
Got it? 100% block value as Holy Damage is HUGE (remeber those changes to str / block value and Prot with Divine Str?).<br />
<br />
And other skill got some damage nerf. The increased Shield Slam is more to compensate that than closing the gap to Pallies version.<br />
<br />
<br />
indeed 1 point of holy damage is so much more better than 1 point of physical. good one. Maybe you mean threat....<br />
100%BV+300 holy dmg is soo HUGE compared to 990-1040 +100%BV. Small tip. low value are bad when you try to dps.<br />
<br />
uu. warriors got nerfed. Battle Shout is down by 2 points from 550 to 548.<br />
and another nerf. The warrior's blessing of salvation(yea, it was moved to the warrior) Vigilance transfers 10% threat the warrior...aa, wait this is not a nerf, it's a buff.</div></div><hr />

I might say that is the worst nerf to holy ever but that would be silly. We have had worse. Plus it was never implemented in the first place. Divine plea is only gonna be helpful in grinding now and is gonna be useless to a holy raiding paladin.</div></div><hr />

I am talking about Medallion of the Horde. Havent seen a single sign that this trinket will have a new and better version in 2 weeks. Have you?<br />
<br />
Even if you think you can justify a reason... why didn't you just use badges....<br />
Because, currently I am spending my last badges on gems, which is more important for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
And further more, you can get that 40k back in the next two weeks... <br />
No.<br />
<br />
Please go back to your welfare cave.</div></div><hr />
