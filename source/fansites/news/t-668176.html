of course - a raid instance is only properly tuned if it is un-killable before the entire raid has the best in slot items in every slot from the previous instance and all previous fights in the instance, and after the raid has wiped on it for weeks on end once having that required gear. Blizzard caters to casuals by having normal difficulty accessible to them. It is blasphemy that they design the game with it in mind for everyone to actually see the boss fights that they put their development time into. Really, only about 5% of the player base should ever see the fights while the rest of the player base should still be stuck farming 10 and 25 man naxx. Duh. And of course it is a joke as soon as 2 or 3 of the world's top guilds kill it. Because that's what measures encounter difficulty.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seltheus</div><div class="date">2009-09-11, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Besides Guilds w/o even having 4 piece T9 bonus killing it in the first Raid ID...this really shows its a joke...not many will kill it, but as soon as people gathered some equip they will kill it as well. Mimiron HM and Yogg+0 took people like several weeks...Anubarak HM killed in 1st ID only shows that the Top guilds kill it faster but many will follow.<br />
<br />
PS: Anubarak is a challenge? Sure...its a AoE challenge...and not to forget those Buffs from the nerubian gravewatchers will be nerfed anyway in the next few IDs...probably to 25% per nerub standing near each other...making it more a joke...and probably one will get erased from spawning, so its only 3...as for now...the only thing neccesarry to kill anub HM is lots of AoE spamming/class stacking to get enough dmg on the adds AND anub...besides some skill...but nothing out of the ordinary...every well geared guild who got most Ulduar HMs down will get anub HM down as well pretty fast...while others will follow with the first nerfs.<br />
<br />
And as soon as he got nerfed...he will get down as fast as Mimi HM got down all of a sudden when he got nerfed.</div></div><hr />

I'm not going to see Anub heroic mode for a while and i'm far from being a superhero player, but If it took several weeks to clean naxx 40 men, same for sunwell, 5-6 weeks to kill Mimiron in hard mode but only 1 week to kill anub, In my way of thinking blizzard as geven a fearly nice encounter en normal mode but not enough for theses guilds who cleaned it in a couple of days.<br />
<br />
I don't want blizzard to release 1 boss a month and so on, i woudlike them to make other nice challenges like Vael at the time, or reliquary of souls, these where very nice fights, and you rarelly one shotted the boss.<br />

For the hunters, maybe they just didn't have any online at the time or their hunter showed up late. At least if you are a hunter you can think of reasons why one wasn't in the kill. I'm a sad panda for the moonkin who is last on meters for DPS. /pat Lappé</div></div><hr />

Is ToC Sunwell? NO but blizz admits it's not supposed to be that place was nuts.<br />
Should an average good guild be able to clear that place the first week? No but are these guys or any of the others that have done it just your average guild? These guys are pro, literally.<br />
ToC reg was easy, too easy but it was just regular, ToC heroic seems pretty challenging for a regular run of the mill guild.<br />

Additionally, they added the new battleground the same patch.<br />
But as to the raid itself, I love it. The models on the bosses may be boring and re-used, but the actual fight mechanics are quite interesting.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Their ret pally did 8800dps? i know my character isn't in the same class as that one, but wtf? I mean we push the same buttons, there is no secret rotation.... that's just crazy.<br />
<br />
Maybe heroic is different, but in normal mode the adds are typically clumped together, and they're also all Undead.</div></div><hr />

The diffrence between #1 and #2 is huge.<br />
How the hell did he manage to pull 11.7k dps?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, geared like they are.. having 4 adds + boss for the entire duration of the fight (when hes not burrowed) and having the rogues/dk/wars mass aoe.. yeah you'll get numbers like that.</div></div><hr />

What would they worry about instead? Beating a bunch of 13 year old noobs in a battle ground? PVE is where it's at, everyone fights the same thing Blizz puts out there, PVE who knows who you are fighting or how good they are. But I guess if you want the good weapons without working too hard for it PVP is the way to go.</div></div><hr />

To give you something else to do, it's a blanket scheme. I'm surprised this is even being asked, every top guild at one point or another has stated that they like the direction blizzard is going &amp; are excited to see what's next. Yeah an encounter is going to be hard at first, but not the impossible of banging your head for weeks on end hard. It just isn't that way anymore, &amp; wish those that want that to just move on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to understand that in order to achieve these world 1st kills a lot of raid stacking is required due to lack of gear. All the DPS specced specifically for the encounter and through a little digging you can find that the rogues and DKs all used glyphs that even further increased their AoE. <br />
<br />
In Anub'arak hardmode, as you can see in the video, there are adds present for the majority of the fight. FoK spam for rogues is ridiculous and with 5 targets present it's very feasible to see numbers like that. The DKs used DnD along with the increased DoT damage unholy provides.<br />
<br />
TL;DL take world 1st,2nd,etc meters with a grain of salt. Think behind the logic of it before jumping to conclusions about an entire class(es).</div></div><hr />

Volley was completely insane actually - 25kDPS huntars in spider wing :P. Yes FoK is also OP, being a bit corrected soon (later than it should though). Anyway, Blizz destroyed quality AOE in WotLK. It became a lower skilled version of tank and spank.</div></div><hr />

Yes FoK is also OP, being a bit corrected soon (later than it should though). Anyway, Blizz destroyed quality AOE in WotLK. It became a lower skilled version of tank and spank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Volley is complete trash, and it was at most 30% better when wrath launched.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Spam FoK, which is hitting at least 4 adds and the boss. Throw in Blade flurry/AR and get the FoK glyph (+20% damage).<br />
<br />
Also, someone was asking why that one rogue had such a big damage lead from the next -- could be that he didnt get pursued in phase 2, or that he used his cooldowns with slightly different timing (when more adds were up), or that he got hysteria multiple times when the others didn't.</div></div><hr />

Even better, lb on ich mob, flamstrike + blizzard, easy. You spec the mage with imp bli, shatter and frostbitten, and then hf</div></div><hr />

Why would you leave 15 empty raid slots when you can put them to use?</div></div><hr />

Actually flamestrike as fire just slows your dps down, you just pop LB on the adds as they come (only once) and blizz, blizz,blizz.</div></div><hr />

Uh, volley was amazing when 3.0 hit. Myself and the other two hunters in guild crushed felmyst every week from 3.0 till wrath release because of volleying the constructs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They didn't copy the strat because they didn't have 6-7 people SS rez during the fight they did it for real.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The diffrence between #1 and #2 is huge.<br />
How the hell did he manage to pull 11.7k dps?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
One of my friends is in the 4th top guild on our server. He is a rogue that regularly does ~11k DPS on 25-man hard/heroic modes. The rogues in the #1 guild apparently do even more than that. Yeah. I don't know either, makes me cry...LoL</div></div><hr />

The WF kill was impressive enough, but turning around and doing it in 41 fewer attempts the very next week is just incredible. We're all pulling for Tribute to Insanity, but doubtless it'll happen soon enough.<br />
<br />
A lot of people have been using this thread to complain about their class woes, but I really don't think that's the issue here. It's always been my belief that a balanced raid composed of 2-3 of every class, in various specs, should be able to handle any encounter that Blizz throws at us.<br />
<br />
What then ends up being so disappointing is seeing them design an encounter that completely relies on AoE damage. For all intents and purposes, Paragon's kill was comprised of 3 DPS classes. I'm fine with rogues, unholy DKs, and mages performing above and beyond in aoe fights, but there has to be a limit. To make a fight so dependent on AoE that mastering it requires the exclusion of every other class is simply absurd.<br />
<br />
Usually I'm excited about world firsts and I inundate myself with videos and strats in order to have a shot at accomplishing the same thing as the world's top guilds.<br />
<br />
...our 25man raids typically consist of 4-5 warlocks, 2-3 hunters, and several other less-than-optimal AoE DPS. How am I supposed to get excited for this fight? It's 10% execution, 10% skill, and 80% class selection. Simply depressing for those of us who thought that skill was the attribute that will ultimately define success.</div></div><hr />

number of pure dps class &gt; number of buff class in the game<br />
<br />
does blizzard want the raid combination to be this??<br />
<br />
later maybe all raids have 1/3 are rogues..* so ... stupid<br />

if you want to get achievement, u cannot play shaman dps. haha</div></div><hr />

<br />
the fact tells us, blizzard's design failed, &quot;balance&quot; doesnt mean best<br />
<br />
the designers only know to use computer to simulate<br />
just like one guild said &quot;in theroy it is impossible to down yogg-0&quot;</div></div><hr />
