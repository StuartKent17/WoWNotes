Good news everyone! The recruitment was fairly succesful and most of the applications I received (between 250 and 300, if you want to know) are processed by now. The recruitment is closed for the moment until we figure out who's going to be a moderator and who isn't. Due to the insane amount of applications, I won't be able to reply to everyone and I will just make an announcement in a few days to claim that my forums are now full of love and awesome moderators. <br />
<br />
Also note that if you got refused it doesn't necessarily mean that you are awful, a few decent users won't be selected just because they didn't post enough on the forums. Moderators aren't just here to ban people, they're here to keep their forum alive and make it a wonderful place of happiness, people who already had sticky posts on a forum and contributed regularly have 90% chance to become a mod, but the ones who didn't even have an account on the forums and mailed me to become a Global Moderator to ban people probably won't be selected. (Yes, it happened)<br />
<br />
I'd like to thank all the members who applied, even if you end up not being selected it's always great to see that some people care! <br />

Warriors issues and tanks AE Tanking<br />
1) We're much more concerned about tank single target dps than we are tank AE dps. Especially in Icecrown, there are virtually no fights where the tank's dps contribution on an AE fight is really going to amount to much. You can make an argument that the single target dps can be relevant on e.g. Festergut (though again, I still don't think there are that many cases where the difference between success and fail are the tank's dps).<br />
<br />
2) You may find Devastate boring, but Devastate is a very easy ability to buff because even small tweaks have large effects given how often it is used. Buffing say Shield Slam (or even Def Stance) would make the PvP balance we're trying to solve even worse. You'd have to buff Revenge enormously to see a difference. Any buff to Heroic Strike affects dps warriors in PvE as well who aren't hurting at all. Some of the ideas about e.g. Rend are interesting, but we're pretty sure the last thing the warrior needs is yet another ability to manage while tanking. Long term that might be the kind of thing we consider, but given that we're looking for a safe and easy buff, that's not the kind of thing we want to mess with now. (Consider that even if we did a PTR, who is going to be on there when the competition is new bosses in Icecrown?)<br />
<br />
3) There are differences in how tanks generate AE threat, and therefore damage. Warriors are jealous of the DK and especially paladin persistent area-based damage, and the others are jealous of the warrior's burst AE threat on incoming adds. Druids are jealous of anyone with more than one button. <br />
<br />
So, yes, one way of handling this is to give every tank a burst AE attack like Thunderclap, a sustained AE attack like Consecrate, and a mass taunt like Challenging Shout just for good measure. That's the kind of thing we are really reluctant to do though because it just works against the justification for having 4 tanking classes when they all perform the same way including using the same kind of tools. Now, on the other hand no tank should be horribly gimped in any of those situations, and except for rare exceptions they really aren't. We're mostly talking quality of life issues here. (One such exception: DK offtanks on Yogg had trouble picking up adds and the dps couldn't afford to wait. As long as there aren't a ton of fights like this though, we don't think it's a systemic flaw.)<br />
<br />
4) Long-term, the paladin manner of generating AE damage and threat is probably too good, especially given how simple it is. To be honest, we have very mixed feelings on the whole AE tanking game. We brought the druid and warrior more in line with the paladin for fear of recreating the Shattered Halls / Mount Hyjal experience, where other tanks just weren't competitive. What that has led to of course is the AE tank + AE style of damage for almost every pull. You need the tools to be able to tank legitimate adds fights (imagine lots of incoming mobs), but does that mean every pull needs to devolve into that? We'd like to see less AE overall, so buffing everyone's AE tools isn't going to be tops on our agenda. That does however mean that we really can't afford to have a &quot;best AE tank&quot;, and while things are more fair there than they were in BC, they aren't fair enough.<br />
<br />
Sorry for going off topic here, but these kinds of questions have come up a lot lately, so I figured I'd just share some of our discussions publicly. <br />

Does that mean that we can hope in a Cataclysm setting to see more &quot;sophisticated&quot; trash fights in heroics and raids?What i mean is, if they want to see less AE overally, maybe they will decide to return CC in Instances?Well i'd be more than happy to see that but still no one can judge by just a blizzquote.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. Non-paladins would struggle to keep more than 4 mobs in TBC against equally geared dps however high their gear was. In WotLK tanks could keep tons of mobs right from the start (indeed it was easier in the beginning since tank threat does not scale as well as dps threat (is too front-loaded progression-wise)). What changes is how many mobs they can keep before overtaxing the healer or outright dying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What exactly was wrong with the &quot;Shattered Halls / Mount Hyjal experience&quot;? Why can't you have one tanking class which is good at AE tanking (paladin) while others are better at single target tanking, one with high hp (bear) and another with a shield (warrior)? Different tanks for different tasks would bring more variety to the game. If WotLK has taught us anything, it's that the &quot;everyone should be able to do everything&quot; or &quot;bring the player not the class&quot; philosophy only leads to boring facerolling.</div></div><hr />

in wotlk is easy to tank many ads, if dps wait few secs and then use AoE. Often happens that I am runing into pack, I hit first mob of four runing to other ads to gather them and then drop AoE - but every dps starts nuking random ads - before i gather all to one place :D And then is a really really big problem to tank them, when every add start running to diferent dps :-D<br />
And dungs like Forge of souls where is long way between ads in one pack with casters in it and i have only one ability for silence (cd 30 sec) and one stun with spell interrup (cd 40 sec) is a diferent story :-D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peacemoon</div><div class="date">2010-01-25, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest, its about time Blizzard decided to have another look at the 'threat' mechanics and making them more relevant.<br />
<br />
I remember GC posting that they believed threat should not be an issue anymore, and people should generally not have to consider it. Personally I think it has had a very negative effect on the game. All it leads to is the &quot;deskilling&quot; of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
Sure, perhaps single target threat against a boss should never be a huge issue but AoE threat? I realise that old heroics are now a stomping ground anyway due to gear inflation, but even in challenging content tanks have little trouble AoE tanking everything. <br />
<br />
Healers still have to watch their threat a little on AoE pulls, such as if there are new adds arriving. However I used to play games like Dark Age of Camelot where managing aggro and managing your power(Mana) were HUGE tasks, a good healer had to be very aware of both aspects and it to me, it was more challenging. WoW healing has degenerated into button mashing against the GCD, with little consideration to your threat or mana conservation, even in relevant raiding content like ICC.<br />
<br />
The combination of mass AoE tanking and button mashing healing without fear of mana-efficiency or aggro, which while advertised as 'fun', is actually quite boring once you faceroll yet another raid/boss. WoW is becoming less of an RPG/MMO and more of an action console game, with the difficulty permanently set on VERY EASY. ::)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymrohd</div><div class="date">2010-01-25, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Threat was the big issue of Classic. It was the one aspect of the game that challenged everyone from the very first boss in the very first raid. It remained an issue in TBC without being ridiculous (Remember the Underbog heroic twin giant pull?) It has been removed from the game in WotLK bar a very few encounters, and even then with ease of use in Misdirect it is not as detrimental (though Anub HC with no MD can be a pain). I think some of the mechanics that led to easymoding in WotLK need to be rethough thoroughly. That and grind (I have taken multiple breaks from WoW because of grind frustration and I am a gaming addict).</div></div><hr />

People are normally suprised not to see a pally tank in random dungeons. For dungeons, I roll with a build that includes Improved Cleave and Glyph of Cleaving and I'm suprised no one has mentioned anything about cleave that I've seen. For AE tanking, this usually works very well, however you must be careful because cleave will only go off if you still have the same target selected when cleave goes off. If you tab or select another target to throw a devastate on, the cleave just cancels. I think it would be beneficial if a change was made to allow cleave to go off if you switch targets or the target dies, or better yet maybe make cleave not require a target just like thunderclap.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse I remember before WotLK, people actually used CC. I haven't seen a mage use a single poly or a rogue sap anything, etc my entire time leveling.</div></div><hr />

I think it would be very reasonable if tanks could not reliably hold more than 3 mobs (maybe 4 for paladins so they can keep their niche). <br />
<br />
<br />
While I might have an unpopular opinion, I far prefer the 15-30 minute Heroics with AEing trash, to the Classic / Burning Crusade versions. <br />
<br />
While it requires less finesse, Trash and Heroics aren't really there specifically to be endgame challenges. As a tank now, if someone does something stupid, or makes a mistake, or is just not very good; they won't usually wipe the group as a result. This makes it a lot easier to take just about anyone on a run. It also reduces wasted time and endless frustration when you happen to have &quot;that guy&quot; along, or half your group is drunk or something. This kind of irritation is part of what has kept tank numbers down.<br />
<br />
It also tends to make them faster, since with less coordination required, there's less prep time before pulls, less repositioning during, and less waiting for cooldowns or other limiting factors before starting the next.<br />
<br />
While the occasional &quot;CC This Mob&quot; might be a nice change of pace, I am definitely not interested in needing to do so for more than 20% of the non-skippable trash, and whatever those CC targets are, should be able to be outgeared, so someone 4 tiers of content higher doesn't still need the same level of coordination as people in entry level gear.<br />
<br />
Some of the Heroics were significantly more difficult when we were all wearing 174/187/200 ilevel gear and didn't have enough HP and damage to soak playing sloppy and burn a boss down in under a minute or two. With just the projected changes to Healing, HP, and Avoidance in Cataclysm I think a lot of the heroic stuff will change regardless, since outgearing things won't mean &quot;tanks avoids 90% of all damage, healer takes nap, dps goes crazy&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As much sense as that makes in theory, in practice what happens is Warrior tanks aren't allowed to tank Shattered Halls(without all three DPS classes being able to CC) and Mount Hyjal. You can't exclude a particular class from entire raids and dungeons because of game mechanics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At lv80 and high gear levels, cleave is less effective as a tanking tool then it was while leveling. When threat is critical, tabbing through the targets with devestate and heroic strike makes better threat than relying on cleave. That's why it's not been brought up much. Buffing cleave would really send the PvP people into fits so I don't see it being on Blizz's buff list any time soon.<br />
<br />
I've found glyphs that buff primary tanking abilities like sunder armor/devestate to be most effective for holding multi-target threat against raid geared lv80 dpsers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This will:<br />
a) Not be speccable by dps warriors without loosing way to many vital talents (quite obviously)<br />
b) Not cause protection warriors to be overpowered in pvp (How often do you end up with extra rage to spam out heroic stikes with in pvp?)<br />
c) Remove the totally utter crap talent safeguard from the game and let it R.I.P. forever since its allready dead.<br />
<br />
Surely it might have a minor impact on prot pvp in arena (incase people specced into safe guard for some support to their team members)<br />
<br />
Since it seems everything regarding protection warrior balance is balanced around shield slam or devastate, I really think that would be a more usefull way to resolve the issue than simply adding some bonus damage to devastate.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure about both the blue post and this response to it. To be frank, I could tank 9 mobs easily with my Warrior,even on heroic, and that's with Karazhan gear.The only true limit was the incoming damage. Not the threat. In other words, which I've been saying untill WotLK released and since mid-Vanilla.. 99% of the Warriors are scrub tanks with the skill of a baby trying to eat an icecream. It's a mess!</div></div><hr />

lol pos and fos. in those groups of trash there's like 5 mobs and only 2-3 of which need to be controlled.<br />

OK I can see complaining about Teh Gladiators... It's only rarely amusing, but how are DLC and the MMO Report representative of everything wrong with the MMO community? Even in the case of Teh Gladiators, that's a pretty strong statement to make. I personally don't find it particularly amusing, but that hardly makes it an indicator of some sort of community wide problem.

They were the end game for those who couldn't raid (for whatever reason), they are supposed to be the place where you learn your class, your spells and get better at playing this game, so you can go raid.<br />

Since they removed this in WotLK for your aoe grindfestival of 15min, all that got pushed to the raid scenario. Then you now spend a 7 day lockout with huge fails because people don't know what they &quot;should/could/have to&quot; do and have to read news about huge raid nerfs because now they can't change the fact that the game should acomodate every kind of player in all raids or that you should have easy raid content because those players need to learn what they didn't in heroics.<br />

As soon as the players learned what they could do and what to do, you could do very fast heroic runs in TBC. But well... guess that saying &quot;think&quot; while playing a game is offensive now...</div></div><hr />

Nope, warriors were used for the gimmick spellcasters (spellreflect threat) only. Druids AND Paladins were used for Abominations. Of course you would not deny a slot for your warrior friend if you didn't have all the tank slots filled for the &quot;spellreflect warrior&quot; + paladins and druids. But the rule was &quot;one warrior for spellreflect is enough&quot;.<br />
<br />
Prot warriors had the same problem of the dpsers without CC. They didn't have a chance in the tough heroics (SLab, SHalls...) after Paladins got that stream of huge buffs after each patch.<br />
<br />
You could do all of those without 3 dpsers with CC or without a prot paladin, but people became too lazy to think (the same way they're now with the &quot;lololol 15 min heroics or no deal!&quot;). Even the dpsers without CC would /cheer at Prot Paladins, after all they could finally join heroic groups without been kicked for not having CC spells.</div></div><hr />

Because people only wanted paladin tanks. They'd only take another tank if they couldn't find anything else and were desperate.<br />

Try having four tanking classes and knowing only one of those classes is actually getting runs. It's an idiot way of designing a game, and I'm glad it's gone. Only someone who's never had that experience wouldn't understand. <br />

For raid trash / boss i prefer a lot movement / skill fight than just cc theses target, burn that target, then rince and repeat....<br />

Heroics aren't serious business. They are supose to be the entry lvl difficulties. Raid are far more serious business. If they had to make harder trash i prefer they made them on raid, not heroic.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont care realy about pull and trash when i'm on one of my tank. But when i farm them on a healer or a DPS, having a stupid or unskilled tank can ruin your day...</div></div><hr />

To be frank, I could tank 9 mobs easily with my Warrior,even on heroic, and that's with Karazhan gear.The only true limit was the incoming damage. Not the threat. In other words, which I've been saying untill WotLK released and since mid-Vanilla.. 99% of the Warriors are scrub tanks with the skill of a baby trying to eat an icecream. It's a mess!<br />
<br />
<br />
So you found it easy to tank heroics as a warrior, in gear that outleved those heroics?<br />
<br />
I'll bet you can get places in your car faster than someone on a unicycle can too.<br />
<br />
This is really quite simple. If your gear is better than you need it to be, of course you can do more. But for people who didn't have that gear, or were trying to learn the encounters, paladin tanks were the clear choice for most groups out there. <br />
<br />
I've been playing since 2005, so I know very well what tanks were needed when. And BC was definitely the era of the paladin tank.</div></div><hr />

anyway, you can bring back the CC era if you want, but if someone find that particular class have it easier. It will spread to the entire community. After that that particular class will be the only class that people will bring to that particular place...<br />

You misunderstood me. The issue here is not gear. Gear is a limiter when recieving x damage vs y healthpool (edited*), but keeping threat on more than 3 mobs used to be challenging as hell for more than 4/5th of the warriors playing during both Vanilla and tBC. I simply disagree. I've never had issues keeping threat on anything below 9 mobs. Gear is irrelevant to this point. However, if you're going to argue that a better weapon means more threat, I'll say, fair enough, but than also please consider the fact that during tBC, you were required to have Karazhan or higher gear to even be allowed to tank Heroics. <br />
<br />
WotLK might have dumbed down your memories of that a bit or you never actually played in those days :) I think the latter.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nutnics</div><div class="date">2010-01-25, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a warrior tank, AOE threat is not that bad of an issue.

Does it realy require a lot of skill to bring 3 mage and ask them to spam sheep on 1 target ?<br />

no<br />

So what is the point?<br />
<br />
<br />
CC doesn't require a lot of skill.<br />

I dont care about Trash being easy as hell in dungeon / heroic. It will just suck too much when you pugs... I saw theses days so much retard that thinking we might return to a full CC Crap heroic style make me sick.<br />

i remember in TBC i tryed to make almost no Pug because it was a real pain in the ass... until i lvled a prot pally. <br />

Having to think and coordinate your pull involves much more skill then just charging in and AoEing the crap out of everything. It involved teamwork and communication.<br />

Wow, I finally registered just because this comment has compelled me to reply.<br />
<br />
No, I tanked heroics daily in TBC, and I never stepped foot into a 10 or 25 man until Wrath was out. I'd just had a kid, so raiding was out, but I loved heroics. Perhaps *you* didn't succeed in tanking heroics unless you outgeared them, but I had a good measure of success.<br />
<br />
It seems a massive stretch to imagine that you failed at tanking in heroic gear, and yet as soon as you had Kara gear you could easily hold aggro on 9+ mobs? I'm thinking either your memories are distorted, or you're taking liberties with the truth. I know the TBC heroics well - tell me, what kind of pulls are you thinking of that sent 9+ mobs at you? (I presume elite mobs, not the packs of flowers in Botanica, or suchlike). And what abilities did you use to hold aggro on NINE mobs simultaneously? Thunderclap was your primary ability, but at 20 rage it couldn't be spammed, and unless your dps were totally holding back, you would need to invest *some* rage into cleaving your primary kill targets. In TBC heroics a random elite would 2-shot a clothy if it got loose.<br />
<br />
I'm open to hearing the strategy that allowed you to tank more than double the number of mobs that other players were typically capable of after CC, but honestly, having run those places to death as dps and as tank, I never saw anyone (apart from pally tanks) capable of close the level of AoE aggro and mitigation you're claiming. And that includes plenty of BT and ST geared guys. It would make you the best TBC warrior tank I'd ever met.<br />
<br />
Except that you believed you weren't capable of tanking in appropriate level gear, and I was. So... I'm better than the best?<br />
<br />
Does not compute.</div></div><hr />

just a little<br />
<br />
mages weres enough skilled to sheep their target. <br />
<br />
But other DPS had a hard time trying to find a spot to any heroics. <br />
<br />
<br />
On one side you had that prot pally saying, LFM DPS that heroic, on the other side you had that warrior or bear saying LFM CC (mage) for that particular heroic...<br />
<br />
<br />
like i said, im not against harder trash/harder strat, but i prefer they keep it in raid. <br />
<br />
i hate encounter like Instructor in naxx where you absolutly need to have 2 priest in a group to do it. if they want to bring back the CC era, they need to make sure that every class in every spec will be able to CC</div></div><hr />

1. to have need of; need: He requires medical care.<br />

3. to ask for authoritatively or imperatively; demand.<br />
4. to impose need or occasion for; make necessary or indispensable: The work required infinite patience.<br />
5. to call for or exact as obligatory; ordain: The law requires annual income-tax returns.<br />
6. to place under an obligation or necessity: The situation requires me to take immediate action.<br />
7. Chiefly British. to desire; wish to have: Will you require tea at four o'clock? <br />
<br />
To summarize, my server didn't even let you go NEAR heroics without semi epic gear. <br />
<br />
And yes, I am the best tBC Warrior that I encountered. I've leveled 1-60, to 70 in full prot, leveling only on dungeons and a rare class quest. I was the best in Vanilla as well tbh. And the sad truth of all this bragging is, I'm not even lying. Just never really had the guild to show it off in, since Warriors had a bloody tough time getting in guilds and I have had personality issues (I was young):P But I guess you figured that out already hehe.<br />
<br />
Of course, this also depended on the dps. I'm talking about sane dps (not dps numbers but brain capacity)<br />
<br />
And I don't have a strategy. You see, that's the whole point actually, a strategy is something fixed. Tanking is dynamic and required an exact knowledge of mob behavior back in those days. How many Devastates would be enough on one target to keep it on me if no dps would hit it, which target is the rogue hitting for extra attention (since Rogues never hit the correct target), are the ranged mobs positioned properly enough that they have no way to get out of melee. Stun runners, stance dance(, charge), intercept, intervene, all skillsets that regular Warriors rarely used to their proper advantage. Losing agro isn't bad, as long as you know how and when you're going to get it back. You needed to expect to lose it and when it happened you'd have to be on that target within a second. After playing for over 3 years as prot only, I can truthfully say that I knew exactly when I would lose agro on which mob and I was ready to counter it one way or the other. I'm not saying that I never had a sweat over it, but I was damn good.</div></div><hr />

Requiring CC in cata heroics will not make them as punishing as they were in TBC. We have been told that all classes will have higher health pools in Cata, so even mobs that hit heavily would not be able to oneshot a healer or a clothie before the group had time to react.</div></div><hr />

It will bring back the cc needed for some fights/trash, which will be much more interesting then AE every pull (ofc this does not include some ulduar and icc trash). <br />
<br />
But plz don't bring this thing to hcs, or they will become more annoying then raids. Making hcs harder does not mean having to cc every pack. You just add mobs like there are in FoS/PoS (pre-nerf HoR mobs are a little extreme) or add &quot;mini&quot; bosses to make them much more interesting. <br />
<br />
Also i think the overall baseline AE tanking threat and dmg (from both tank and dps) should be lowered, and glyphs should be added to increase such things by 50%. You can change glyphs to do more AE threat/dps when fights have alot of avg hitting mobs. Some fights should have mobs which hit very hard, so the dps will need to cc them (ofc this should only be in raids and raid bosses) and do single target dps. This kind of gameplay will bring alot of varieties, instead of repeating the &quot;tbc era&quot; where every darn thing needs cc or the &quot;wotlk era&quot; where every thing can be AE'ed.<br />
<br />
Also cata will be loaded with dragonkins, and only hunters (trap) pala (stun) and rogue (sap) can cc them (feel free to correct me), ofc there are few classes which can stun for a few secs. This will hurt the whole cc part alot. So i believe they should give cc to couple of other classes which works on dragonkins.<br />

I feel like I'm getting trolled, but I'll bite. Here are my issues with what you're saying. In TBC heroic groups were formed using the lame LFG tool and chat channel, as well as city trade. There wasn't the same gearscore approach as we have now in Wrath. You wanted to tank a heroic? You found dps that wanted the dungeon. They only saw your gear after zoning, I think that the armory only arrived mid-TBC too. It doesn't make sense that you were getting rejected as a heroic tank unless you were failing on the first few pulls. People were also not so quick to drop. You'd invited for the group, traveled to the stone, summoned, buffed and entered. Even the most elitist group members often had a 3 wipe rule, unless it was painfully obvious that the group wasn't up to it.<br />
<br />
And here's my key question. In what situations in heroics were you tanking 9+ mobs? Just name a few heroics/pulls where it was necessary (apart from SH, which went up to 7 elite mobs, IIRC). I'm interested in how this all went down. CC was the order of the day, the pulls were known. What did you do differently that even gave you the opportunity to tank 9+ mobs? I *want* to believe I'm talking to the warrior equivalent of Athene, but your story just doesn't add up. Go on, convince me otherwise.<br />
<br />
And before someone replies, /s on the Athene comment. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, you recall the room in SH, with about ~5 mobs in front of it and about 8 + 1 (5 in the center, 2 in the beds 1 near the door) wolf inside of it ? The warlock feared one of the adds into that room and they came back with nearly that entire room, while we we're still doing about half of the group that was in front of it. It took some real sweat to get them all glued to me, but I pulled it off. This was on Heroic mode and was admittedly the highest amount of mobs I ever tanked before. I also think that was the absolute top of my game with everything going the way I hoped it would, but hey, it was glorious at least :) <br />
<br />
The point itself is also not about exactly how many mobs, but more about the theory that only Paladins could properly AoE tank. I had to fight this my entire 3 year career (1.5 more after that), because of the mental state of all the other Warriors in the field. If I had been Blizzard I would probably have given them the finger and tell them to l2p, but sadly, they gave them aoe tanking capability and ruined the fun of playing it. I liked and hated being sort of unique. Being unique is a lie, because I actually met a few that got close to what I could do and I can say they were all good tanks, but Blizzard doesn't really care when 90 99% of the warriors QQ in 2 years succession.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also relevant to your story is the part where I don't lie. If people need someone and they ask what my gear is, I'm not going to tell them full epic when I'm in full blue's or 50% blues. I'll tell them exactly what I am. If they then proceed to pass, I might still try and convince them, but let's just say that my server was quite elitist.<br />
<br />
I'm also not really trolling you. I'm good at it if I want to and I might do it without even knowing it anymore, but it wasn't my intention :)</div></div><hr />

Good post<br />
<br />
there is other mecanism that can be made to make trash pull less boring.<br />
<br />
<br />
exemple<br />
<br />
- you got 3 mobs and you need to kill them in a particular order <br />
<br />
- That particular mobs need to be on that particular place on death or it will respawn<br />
<br />
- that mob is unkillable and need to be kited until other mobs are died<br />
<br />
- there is a switch on the wall that you need to press when the mobs is at the good hp/position to kill him<br />
<br />
- That mobs is unkillable but will die in 2 min, your healer need to keep ppl alive until the end<br />
<br />
etc<br />
<br />
There is a lot of stuff that can be made to make trash less boring without the need of any CC at all. CC is okay but i dont think the whole mecanism is realy that fun or need that much skill. also in my mind, the game should be tuned for raid, not heroics, . but i prefer heroics to be easy at the start.if the third patch of cataclysm bring a new hard heroic, im fine with that if it do not need a particular class to be able to succed. <br />
<br />
btw rogue can sap dragonkin at last rank</div></div><hr />

9 on warrior? BULLSHIT! If you didn't knew this, Warriors had Thunder Clap with a 4 targets maximum limit, didn't have Shockwave, and most important of all... Didn't have Damage Shield (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=58874). <br />

I've considered many times to actually make movies about my tanking..but I'm not really that kind of attention whore. Don't call things bullshit just because you cannot do them.<br />

How long did dps wait for you to have solid aggro over this many mobs? I presume you were using cleave and TC and using devastate on each mob separately (probably two stacks on each?).

I mostly asked 10 seconds, or 3 sunders. on the primary target. Needless to say that only 10% actually listened. I didn't use Cleave, I used a topview (from above) mouse clicking the names of the mobs quickly swapping through them with Devastate, shieldslamming the main target everytime I could and using Overpower on the targets that made sense. You'll have to excuse small gaps in my mind, because I haven't played my warrior actively for seemingly ages. Yes I used thunderclap and yes it only hit 4 targets, but it would mean I could momentarily focus my attention to those targets that didn't get hit. My theory was (never bothered to confirm) that Thunderclap hit the first 4 mobs in an outward radius (from close to far away) so I tried to position myself such that I knew exactly which mobs would get clapped when I was tanking more than 4. I also used the talent that allowed you to keep ..+15? rage when swapping stances, to be able to intercept more efficiently and swap back without losing too much rage.<br />
<br />
The primary target was actually least of my worry, because I knew it would never insta frag a dps and therefore I allowe myself to keep an eye on it, but not actively build threat on it by anything else besides shield slam. Once I knew I'd probably start losing some agro on it, I'd be ready to taunt or stun ( depending on %hp left etc).<br />

Actually, I cleared BWL. And only raided Karazhan in tBC, due to college and a lack of interest in raiding since Vanilla. I mean, seriously, after BWL, it all went downhill.<br />
And raid tanking and heroic tanking might be the same today, but it wsn't in those days. You needed alot more skill in a simple Heroic, than in a raid. The prove of that is how many wellgeared tanks ended up wiping their groups in Heroics. I had to suffer that many times on my alts and I'm sure alot of you have dealt with the same.<br />
<br />
Edit : I forgot Heroic Strike. When dealing with 4+ mobs, you would gain rage immensely fast. I usually started weaving Heroic Strik into my rotation as well, just hitting whichever target I was hitting at that point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there is other mecanism that can be made to make trash pull less boring.<br />
<br />
<br />
exemple<br />
<br />
- you got 3 mobs and you need to kill them in a particular order <br />
<br />
- That particular mobs need to be on that particular place on death or it will respawn<br />
<br />
- that mob is unkillable and need to be kited until other mobs are died<br />
<br />
- there is a switch on the wall that you need to press when the mobs is at the good hp/position to kill him<br />
<br />
- That mobs is unkillable but will die in 2 min, your healer need to keep ppl alive until the end<br />
<br />
etc<br />
<br />
There is a lot of stuff that can be made to make trash less boring without the need of any CC at all. CC is okay but i dont think the whole mecanism is realy that fun or need that much skill. also in my mind, the game should be tuned for raid, not heroics, . but i prefer heroics to be easy at the start.if the third patch of cataclysm bring a new hard heroic, im fine with that if it do not need a particular class to be able to succed. <br />
<br />
btw rogue can sap dragonkin at last rank<br />
<br />
<br />
Very good ideas about trash. Some of them look more difficult then cc'ing. Blizz has already used some very interesting trash mechanic ingame. Like few in icc and the mimi trash, also my fav FL trash! Not to forget the trash b4 the dragonhawk boss in ZA (don't remember the name) was also very interesting and most mobs there were immune to cc. But it worked fine and were difficult. <br />
<br />
As you said cc does not require alot of skill, especially sheep and sap. Hunter trapping was a little difficult, but you could master it in a few tries. (I played hunter and shaman in tbc)<br />
<br />
Thanx for the rogue cc update :) gonna change my post.</div></div><hr />

I mostly asked 10 seconds, or 3 sunders. on the primary target. Needless to say that only 10% actually listened. [And stuff]<br />
<br />
<br />
10 seconds is ~7 Global Cooldowns, also, there's only room for ONE Thunder Clap. Maybe two, but I don't rememeber if they changed the cooldown from 4 to 6 seconds or something like that. The other were probably 5 or 4, depending on the unremembered cooldown of TC, Devastates and 1 Shield Slam.<br />
<br />
That of course assuming they gave you exactly those 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Being that said... If you got one heal in those 10 seconds, and that's a very good posibility, then your healer died. <br />
<br />
Also in a complete different matter, 10% of 4 is ~less than a half a person, you just killed a half of someone.</div></div><hr />

Well, I didn't let people die, unless I died, so I must've done something right :) I don't care if you believe me or not, I had to fight this(your) attitude for over 3.5 years, people taking Paladin tanks because they'd be better tanks. Quite a complex I tell you. Regardless, my guildies and friends knew who to turn to if they were in need of a tank. That means alot more than your theoretical babbling about probability. Let's just say that I beat the odds. Everytime.<br />
<br />
And I'm really, really not bluffing. But I doubt I can convince you of that, so this debate is mute.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tunak</div><div class="date">2010-01-25, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest, its about time Blizzard decided to have another look at the 'threat' mechanics and making them more relevant.<br />
<br />
I remember GC posting that they believed threat should not be an issue anymore, and people should generally not have to consider it. Personally I think it has had a very negative effect on the game. All it leads to is the &quot;deskilling&quot; of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
Sure, perhaps single target threat against a boss should never be a huge issue but AoE threat? I realise that old heroics are now a stomping ground anyway due to gear inflation, but even in challenging content tanks have little trouble AoE tanking everything. <br />
<br />
Healers still have to watch their threat a little on AoE pulls, such as if there are new adds arriving. However I used to play games like Dark Age of Camelot where managing aggro and managing your power(Mana) were HUGE tasks, a good healer had to be very aware of both aspects and it to me, it was more challenging. WoW healing has degenerated into button mashing against the GCD, with little consideration to your threat or mana conservation, even in relevant raiding content like ICC.<br />
<br />
The combination of mass AoE tanking and button mashing healing without fear of mana-efficiency or aggro, which while advertised as 'fun', is actually quite boring once you faceroll yet another raid/boss. WoW is becoming less of an RPG/MMO and more of an action console game, with the difficulty permanently set on VERY EASY. ::)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deskilling of the game is definently not new. I mean really when you can hit 80, and jump straight into heroic dungeon farming and literally gain a 5k+ gear score in a matter of a week or 2... The game is pretty much as deskilled as it gets. Nothing better than queueing for my daily random and watching the 80 DK in full 232 ToC gear pull an astounding 1400 DPS overall... Honestly I hope they put in some skill checkpoints for cataclysm. Too many baddies in this game as it is and the problem is definentl not getting better.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymrohd</div><div class="date">2010-01-25, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The speed with which you can gain gear has nothing to do with level of skill required by the game. The speed is there so people can gear alts fast. The lack of skill is evident in mechanics, not progression. Utility spells are rarely used (even in raids); everyone simply sticks to their role be it dps, healing or tanking and maybe uses some extra ability every third boss to handle a mechanic. Utilities, as in crowd control, are rarely used. Note that the WoW community misuses the term crowd control badly. People only consider absolute CC that removes an enemy from the game as CC. Any condition that controls/limits the activity of a mob is CC. This is were &quot;deskilling&quot; can be observed. Group and raid synergy have been diminished in favor of individual effect probably because individual effect on a specific role is easier to quantify and balance around.</div></div><hr />

I didn't care at all who tanked in an heroic (talking about classes here), as long as they kept agro, knew how to pull and knew the mechanincs that needed to be known of an instance.<br />

But when someone gets into bullshit like ZOMG I'M AWESOME /flex i.e.<br />
<br />

And yes, I am the best tBC Warrior that I encountered. I've leveled 1-60, to 70 in full prot, leveling only on dungeons and a rare class quest. I was the best in Vanilla as well tbh. And the sad truth of all this bragging is, I'm not even lying. Just never really had the guild to show it off in, since Warriors had a bloody tough time getting in guilds and I have had personality issues (I was young):P But I guess you figured that out already hehe.<br />

<br />
It doesn't make you look any better, specially over the internet.<br />
<br />
Yes, most people used Paladins for heroics and some raids, I don't think that it's still the case though, am I one of those people? I didn't and I don't care in heroics, specially in TBC since we had to spam trade looking for a tank, and I didn't mind in raids as long as we killed things.</div></div><hr />

You should have attempted to read it in context to the quote I replied to. There has never been a statistic such as best tank. Claiming I'd be the one would be silly. Was I good, damn yes.

I know you don't care what anyone thinks, but here's what I think anyway. Since you don't care, don't let it bother you. You threw out a casual claim that you could claim 9+ heroic mobs in TBC without thinking anyone would challenge you on it. When challenged, your story got taller and taller, but you're having to wildly backpedal. 10 seconds of no dps? Good luck, what about healing aggro? And your claims of &quot;I could tank 9 mobs easily&quot; quickly degenerated into &quot;There were 9 mobs this one time, when a warlock feared&quot;. Incidentally the situation you mentioned had a few non-elites, plus... why was the warlock fearing if all the mobs were sticking to you? Unless of course, a loose mob from the initial 5-pull was attacking him?<br />
<br />
The fact is, while you were tanking heroics in your Kara gear, I and many other warriors, were tanking heroics in our regular and heroic gear, and finding success by using the tools at our disposal. Marking targets, coordinating CC, and *most importantly*, pulling responsibly so that 9 elites didn't rush us and wipe the party. I'm sorry, but those skills, entirely missing now in WotLK, are the real signs of skill and ability to tank effectively.<br />
<br />
I'll leave the thread now, please don't make wild claims in future, it just makes constructive debate turn into e-peen comparisons.<br />
<br />
&quot;9 mobs are easy&quot; backpedaling.<br />
<br />
<br />
To be frank, I could tank 9 mobs easily with my Warrior,even on heroic, and that's with Karazhan gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I've never had issues keeping threat on anything below 9 mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that I never had a sweat over it, but I was damn good.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Losing agro isn't bad, as long as you know how and when you're going to get it back.<br />
<br />

(this one time) The warlock feared one of the adds into that room and they came back with nearly that entire room<br />

The truth is, a well played warrior could tank several mobs, as long as the healing was there, and the dps wasn't dumb. Sure thunderclap didn't have unlimited targets like it does now, but you could spam it more. WotLK buffed the damage of Thunderclap, and to avoid &quot;spammy&quot; abilities, they upped the CD on it. Tab TC'ing while rotating Devastates, Revenges, Concussion Blows, and Shield Slams was an extremely viable form of AoE tanking through Vanilla and BC. How else did high level raiding guilds make it into TK pre-attunement nerf, if warriors couldn't tank SH?<br />
<br />
My guild actually didn't use a Paladin Tank until we had already cleared Hyjal. It wasn't until our Druid tank disappeared for two weeks that our GM finally granted a Holy Pally's wish to become a tank. Prior to that decision, we were doing all of Hyjal with two warrior tanks and the druid, which means the first week the druid was gone, it was nothing but the two warrior tanks. Sure there was a lot of kiting, and sure the first few waves we lost a dps or two, but we cleared it that night without wiping. I don't think i've ever had a more stressful night of tanking, as that night with two warriors in Hyjal. <br />
<br />
Do i know how many mobs were on me at a given time? No. Did we use a lot of NPC's? Yes. Did the guild faceroll through it? Hell no. In fact i think the guild had more fun that night as we utilized kiting, CC, and intelligent threat management, more so than any night once the faceroll pally tank entered the fray. If anything, i only appreciated the Pally because it allowed me to swap DPS gear on easy packs and WW/Cleave dps for lulz. On top of that, our Pally tank became a very reliable tank, and continued tanking all the way to Sunwell.<br />
<br />
As for tanking large packs of 9+ mobs in an oshit moment, the only move i think that would work for that is; Battlestance, Retaliation, AoE Taunt, Defensive Stance, Spell Reflect. and then tab Devastate as usual. (Pre WotLK mechanics) <br />
<br />
All the posts that seem to be in denial of competent warrior tanks, have clearly never been with a well played warrior tank. Pre-WotLK, where threat actually mattered, the reason Pally tanks were so desirable in SH was because of how easy they could tank. If you deny that, you're just lying to yourself. Hell, i even looked for Pally tanks on my alts, because they made 5 mans so easy. To play a warrior in a 5 man pre-WotLK actually took skill, and the sad truth is, there were a lot of warriors who were forced into tanking because of the Tank shortage, and they honestly had no clue what they were doing. While any warrior tank worth anything could give a damn about 5 mans, cause they were raiding. Whereas, any noob who could consecrate and cast holy shield could be a pally tank.<br />
<br />
@ Vespian<br />
The only thing i'm doubting of your claims is that you leveled 1-60 as Prot in Vanilla. Nooooobody leveled as Prot in Vanilla. Hell, half the tanks in Vanilla weren't even specced prot. It wasn't until Devestate that prot even became a somewhat acceptable leveling build, and even then (60-70) they would spend their whole day in instances.<br />
<br />
As for me, i'll make no such claims of being the best warrior around....<br />

You are doing it wrong. Avengers shield (or taunt if its down) -&gt; judge -&gt; hammer of the righteous -&gt; consecrate (usually not necessary but hey, may as well) -&gt; SoR etc etc. If you are having trouble AE tanking as a paladin then you really need to reconsider tanking.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warbec</div><div class="date">2010-01-26, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">4) Long-term, the paladin manner of generating AE damage and threat is probably too good, especially given how simple it is. To be honest, we have very mixed feelings on the whole AE tanking game. We brought the druid and warrior more in line with the paladin for fear of recreating the Shattered Halls / Mount Hyjal experience, where other tanks just weren't competitive. What that has led to of course is the AE tank + AE style of damage for almost every pull. You need the tools to be able to tank legitimate adds fights (imagine lots of incoming mobs), but does that mean every pull needs to devolve into that? We'd like to see less AE overall, so buffing everyone's AE tools isn't going to be tops on our agenda. That does however mean that we really can't afford to have a &quot;best AE tank&quot;, and while things are more fair there than they were in BC, they aren't fair enough.<br />

Seriously... DPS is increasing in such a way that we can have problems creating aggro when DPS decides to AoEDPS in every group.<br />
(and I´m talking about when you get those PUGs where DPS doesn´t care about markings or CC or anything they just run wild and pull before you even do)</div></div><hr />

The speed is there so people can gear alts fast. The lack of skill is evident in mechanics, not progression. Utility spells are rarely used (even in raids); everyone simply sticks to their role be it dps, healing or tanking and maybe uses some extra ability every third boss to handle a mechanic. Utilities, as in crowd control, are rarely used. Note that the WoW community misuses the term crowd control badly. People only consider absolute CC that removes an enemy from the game as CC. Any condition that controls/limits the activity of a mob is CC. This is were &quot;deskilling&quot; can be observed. Group and raid synergy have been diminished in favor of individual effect probably because individual effect on a specific role is easier to quantify and balance around.<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason to degrade CC usage is an effort to make building raids less tougher, as utilities are very specific among classes and designing encounters that rely on lots of utility usage would evidently limit on how raids can be build, which could adversely result in a guild simply switching a bad player from a good player because of the character selection screen. Even today, there are people that are blaming shamans finding its place in every raid because they happen to be the only class that brings bloodlust/heroism(this is usually evident in realms where shamans, particularly dps shamans, are rare to find).</div></div><hr />

Thats so not true the only classes im jealous of on my druid are<br />
<br />
1.A Death Knight's army of the dead and awesome AoE<br />
2.A mage's teleport to city and awesome damage! So not fair, my boomkin cant do that!<br />
3.Paladin, should I say more they are already best at everything, especially bubble hearths (I've actually seen a pally do that in an onyxia, i raid kicked him for being retarded) we druids deserve all that!<br />
4.Priest, they have all those absorbs, druids deserve at least 1 shield thing to put on tanks!<br />
5.Rogue, why cant we be in cat form and dps like them, we are basically the same thing?!<br />
6.Shamans, self rez's, heroism, they are clearly overpowered and we need their abilities!<br />
7.Warrior, they are high dps and super high threat we need that!<br />
<br />
Warlocks, they are fine and have nothing we need<br />
<br />
Hunters, we dont want their abilities we dont want to inherent their noobness that you recieve just rolling one, its the only character I ever stand in the fire or pull aggro on, druids dont want that.</div></div><hr />

I'd agree with you 100% in TBC. Not so sure it is the same thing now though. Wrath did a decent job of giving CC to those who lacked it. If in Cata they spread around CC just a little bit more, we are going to be fine I think, both for PUG 5mans and 10man raids. I still think that in a 25man raid asking for anything is fair game tbh.</div></div><hr />

Is there any thought process to your comment? It is so far from a half way intelligent reply ...<br />
<br />
Blizzard expanded the ignore list due to people like you.</div></div><hr />

I healed a few times 10man content and saw alot of spiking with highly geared warrior and feral tanks not so much with pallies or DKs.</div></div><hr />
