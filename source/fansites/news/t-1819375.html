<br />
Yeah. This will open the door for all sorts of griefing and ppl queueing up only to go afk and sink the other group. This opens the door for some other issues going down the road. Instead of just balancing factions they are breaking the game to counter the issue.</div></div><hr />

The only other way they could fix it is it they, at random, forced faction changes until both factions are equally represented. Imagine the shit storm that would cause.<br />

I've been asking for this for YEARS and I'm glad they're finally doing it.</div></div><hr />

Or the could fix racials, allow same faction pvp instead of this horse shit. There are plenty of better options that doesn't open the door for greifing like this will.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard can do nothing to balance the factions. The community makes the decision on which faction to choose and which is more popular</div></div><hr />

It seems some people can't make a difference between a game and a real life war. <br />
If this was war irl and your country's future depended on it I can imagine people doing it(if this ridiculous thing was possible lol), but this is a game...who plays to lose lol. And even if there are such people I assume you can count them on the fingers on your hands. Seriously the only people I can imagine doing that are those that are strangely &quot;afraid&quot; by this happening. The fact that, that even crossed their minds kinda points to them wanting to do it lol.</div></div><hr />

Yet didn't they state awhile back, that the content was designed the same as if flying had been allowed, and that less resources weren't used designing the zone because of flying?

<br />
What do you think you're uncovering here, Colombo? Are you really going to hammer them over a week or two of work to get things ready? There are all kinds of places that people cannot get to using a glider and a feather that someone on a flying mount can as they have full control over their abilities whereas gliders and feathers are in constant downward motion at speed. <br />
<br />
Maybe they put up fucking barriers to keep people out of some areas on the feather and now they are pulling them out or maybe the engine itself has flags for each region to say flying yes/no. <br />
<br />
In short, please give it a goddamn rest and let them take a few days to turn on whatever they need to.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huldu</div><div class="date">2015-07-16, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This should have been done years and years ago, but I guess it's better late than never. One thing that blows is that they will only be in a high level zone which means you can't make use of this while you're leveling and for some reason have terrible queue times in your battlegroup. How are you suppose to sabotage a game when your faction lose all the time anyways? Anyways it has been a problem in wow since they launched battlegrounds, there is very little incentive to actually win a game. So many other mmos have done it right since then, just shocking that blizz haven't copied any of them at all. At least the mercenaries is a step in the right direction but seriously tho, that delay... it's 2015 now, not 2007.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2015-07-16, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When people queue up to PvP, they typically have the plan to actually try to win because they're going for gear or they just want to have fun. Long queue times often demoralize people before they even get in the door. So this is potentially a good option. Who would say no if they went from 10+ minute queues to &lt;1 minute?<br />
<br />
The people I see creating trouble are the same people who like to camp low levels, leveling quest hubs, and lesser geared people &quot;for fun&quot;. They're the minority, though, and not the majority. In battlegrounds, things are generally more even than out in the world. If someone is intentionally trying to make the team lose, then they could potentially end up reported for it. Since Blizzard apparently does temporarily ban those that AFK in LFR/LFD, why wouldn't Blizzard ban bad sports in battlegrounds? You joined with the pretense that you'd work together as a team to reach a common goal. Even if they don't get reported, the team could easily just let the person or group intentionally trying to lose to get &quot;eaten&quot; by the other team. There's ways to deal with bad sports. The question is if the player base will tolerate such behavior. Then again, if LFR people tolerate people being AFK the entire run, I wouldn't put it past BGers to let people AFK an entire BG. At some point, the player base has to step up and say no. Start reporting those people. The behavior won't change until the player base decides not to accept it.<br />
<br />
As for the masks, Blizzard cleared that up. You won't pop into the BG with a mask. You will actually change races (including racial).<br />
<br />
Honestly, I would have preferred they just let us pick our own racials that we can change like our talents. Let us pick 1 utility, 1 stat booster, and 1 &quot;fun&quot; racial. A utility one might be like every man for himself/herself, rocket boots, sprint, mana torrent, gift of the naaru, etc. Stat booster would be like 1% crit, etc. A &quot;fun&quot; racial might be something more like the goblin bank and vendor reduction (something that has no use in combat). Maybe throw in the profession boosters with the &quot;fun&quot; racials. Doing that would have let Blizzard introduce more racials down the line even if they didn't have more races. Blizzard went through a phase of &quot;bring the player, not the class.&quot; Why can't we play any race we want but have access to any racial we want? Letting us use any racial at any time would also let Blizzard individually buff/nerf/remove/add racials without gutting/buffing entire races. Racials could be unlocked via getting exalted with certain factions or doing long quest chains. Factions are so boring and predictable. Adding something like a racial unlock would add something different. Make it so you can get rep via PvE AND PvP so people don't feel forced to do content they dislike. But I guess that would be too much to ask for.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Etul</div><div class="date">2015-07-16, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'm pretty sure *most* people using the mercenary system will actually use it because they want to get stuff done without waiting for a ridiculous amount of time. If people want to sabotage the other faction, they could still do it now by rolling a toon on the other faction. But my experience from lfr/bgs is that there is usually someone paying attention to the afk people and demanding for them to be kicked. If you want to avoid these 'saboteurs' (the number of which will probably be minimal/negligible and vastly outnumbered by bots) then be proactive and votekick them too. It's not as if people afking in bgs/instances is something new.......</div></div><hr />

Exactly. The PvP community wants to win simple as that. Even before alliance got OP racials Horde were THE PvP faction and has the higher level PvP players. Players followed them and wala faction imbalance. But it's only broken if Alliance is OP apparently</div></div><hr />

That's such a stupid idea. Nobody says no to free things? Then explain why Blizzard says nobody takes the free transfers when they're open? Hm? Explain that. I can, very easily since I have logic and reasoning. Why the hell would anyone want to leave all their friends and a high population to go to some shit ass low pop realm with no people just because it's free? And when they decide they hate it they can't leave without paying money.</div></div><hr />

I play Rated BGs, and in those as an Alliance team you will often face an Alliance Team. There's no change, other than the Alliance on the Horde spawns are flagged Horde. Same racials, appearance, etc, just hostile. I don't understand the need for changing race and racials to the other faction. If there's a lot of Alliance, why not just Alliance vs Alliance. If it's also mixed groups (I.E. Half the Horde team is Alliance Mercenaries) you could see some insults and sabotage in BGs and Ashran. <br />
<br />
Whilst the notes say 'Similarly, it's important to note that these are not creating &quot;mixed-faction&quot; scenarios. There will be no Humans fighting alongside Orcs. Again, our intent is that you are completely unaware that the person next to you is secretly a Night Elf.' people could break the RP and say they're Alliance. I could be wrong on this, but then again, I'm going on what I understand to be said.<br />

And also it is optional. That's a good thing.</div></div><hr />

They don't seem to realize that a lot of the people who transferred to Alliance didn't do it for the racials, but because they're tired of losing as Horde all the time. That's why some expansions Horde dominates, even though it's always been humans that had the best racial. There's always the initial transfer wave by top players for one reason or another, but everyone else who's transferring is doing it to win. It's unlikely that someone who's winning all the time will want to team with the side that's losing all the time just to get into games faster, especially when they still can't even play with cross faction friends. If that were the case the transfers would've stopped as soon as Alliance queues got longer, and that clearly didn't happen. I understand that they're hesitant to remove faction barriers altogether, but I honestly don't think there's any other way to fix the issues, which aren't limited to racials.</div></div><hr />

This one makes it a choice though, and I don't think they should. You should just queue up and get whatever you get. Too many will jump from a losing team, rather than let an equal match build. The one thing that will make this really good (providing Blizz does it) is they can better allocate roles on each team, especially keeping healers even.<br />
<br />
The next step will be to let both faction play and raid together. The whole idea of a faction system in MMOs is dead anyway. I loved playing this game when my server was like 1.1:1 faction balance, and I will say it's the best way to play. But these days, everybody that is smart enough will always roll on the faction and server with the best people and biggest advantages. And besides that, it will bring more and more friends together. WOD brought a lot of people I knew back into the game, but I can only play with half of them because we're all not going to faction change.</div></div><hr />

Not entirely true. Racials and their perceived strength is what effects the race of most. People see top raiders/pvpers are playing one of 2 or 3 races between 2 factions and everybody switches to that. If there was no every man for himself or other racial benefits or blizzard did a mirror of each for each faction this would stop being an issue.<br />

If this was war irl and your country's future depended on it I can imagine people doing it(if this ridiculous thing was possible lol), but this is a game...who plays to lose lol. And even if there are such people I assume you can count them on the fingers on your hands. Seriously the only people I can imagine doing that are those that are strangely &quot;afraid&quot; by this happening. The fact that, that even crossed their minds kinda points to them wanting to do it lol.<br />

You under estimate how much joy some really sad people get from screwing things up for others. They don't care about winning just trying to piss some other people off. They wont even have to actively do much too they could just go run off and sit afk someplace and tab out.<br />

You are right. Instead of fixing problems they should cause more so we don't think the first problem is that big of a deal anymore. Fight the urge to run in here and defend them or just find somebody to disagree with and think for a second. If racials didn't matter then guilds wouldn't jump around for racials for pvp or pve like they have been doing for years. The best proof is the guilds that jumped back to alliance as soon as they had their pve racials buffed. While you might not care about racials the masses seem to and well they effect the game more then just you. I love that you say something about me not speaking for all of us then you toss in a, I'm not alone statement.</div></div><hr />

Merc mode just puts the control in the already dominating faction's hands (hint: it's Alliance).

I'm not even totally sure what immersion is being broken. Being instantly teleported into a battle field and fighting the same battle over and over every 15-30 minutes ad infinitum isn't exactly what I would call immersion. I feel like people will just complain about anything Blizzard does. I'm by no means a fanboy, and Blizz has their faults (including dropping the ball on several aspects of the last few expansions.) However, I'm pretty surprised at all of the negative feedback this change is getting.<br />

Unlike you, I did not suggest that all or even most of the player base agree with me. I merely stated that I am likely not alone in my sentiment. I've played since beta, and have never picked a race or faction for the racials alone. Good racials don't hurt, but I primarily go for aesthetics.</div></div><hr />

I've always thought something like this could work in any of the instanced content (Raids/Dungeons/BG's etc) that allows you to play with friends from the other faction in a similar vein to the way the America's Army video game worked. ie. Your side always had Army skins, the other team Insurgents. Likewise, if you're Horde and joined a group with an Alliance friend/group, they would appear as Horde counterparts to you, whereas you'd appear as Alliance to them. It'd require some tweaks in places (ie. ICC gunship, TotC PVP encounter), but should appear seamless for both sides for the most part.<br />
<br />
In instanced content the gameplay generally trumps the lore anyway so the story driven elements aren't really impacted (and I like my lore). :)<br />

It's probably about as common an occurrence as someone from your own faction &quot;tanking the game&quot; to grief, which again, doesn't come to mind as a common occurrence. It's pretty hard to differentiate between a bad player and one trying to be bad anyhow...? At the end of the day, people want to win in pvp. They want the rewards (thats the only reason a lot of them play pvp at all). You're going to have the afkers and the botters, sure. But that's a constant already.<br />
<br />
If you don't have experience with the system from other games, give it a chance. It can be very fun to fight against your own teammates and alongside the types of characters you're usually trying to gun down. If you dont already play on the other faction it can be fun to see the maps from a different perspective. It can GIVE you perspective on how things are or aren't balanced, or give you more ideas about how to fight the enemy (because you have experience becoming them). <br />

Why are people concerned about others joining only to lose on purpose? Who would do that? In random BGs, you simply can't do this for the sake of boosting anyone since it's random.

God forbid people get to play with each other. Keep riding that shitty faction system in the face of everything crumbling around it. Lord knows it's plotting is so compelling.<br />
<br />
Here's an idea: Disband the factions and make some cool game systems revolving around it. Loljk, just add another bunch of generic rehashed shit instead for the fourth time in a row.</div></div><hr />

You'll earn more waiting 20 minutes and winning, than you will losing two or three times in that same time frame. It'll also feel better to win that one time over losing three times as well, and that 20 minute wait can be filled with other in game activities.</div></div><hr />

We just also don't think that perfectly balanced racials would instantly resolve queue time issues. We also don't think that players should feel forced to faction transfer (potentially away from friends and guildmates) in order to experience reasonable queue times.<br />
<br />
Funny thing, because Alliance used to have short queue times and Horde longer ones. Then you gave humans their trinket racial. To anyone looking at what's happened over the last 3 expansions, it might be apparent that you have been doing all along what you are now claiming not to want to do, and what you claim you don't believe to be the case has in fact been the case all this time.<br />
<br />
But I will give you this much. Balancing racials would in fact not take players over to Horde. You would have to unbalance racials in favor of the Horde for that to happen. That is, after all, what caused people to switch over to Alliance, not the balancing of racials, but the unbalancing of them. You would need to swing pendulum the other way until populations started moving, and before it turned into a mass exodus you would have to make the pendulum swing back and forth in frequent short bursts to stabilize population flows. Which is not what you want to do, because you did make all those people pay for faction transfers and they wouldn't be too happy about having to transfer back.</div></div><hr />

Lore wise there shouldn't even be a war between horde and alliance anymore. Best way to deal with inbalance in battlegrounds and Ashran is to basically just throw away the horde vs alliance story and allow fully mixed teams.</div></div><hr />

Well that already happens with peeps of your own faction who got bored.<br />
<br />
I think the idea of Mercenary Mode is awesome. Who do pvp doenst care about faction... if we cared why wouldnt arenas and rbg follow the idea of faction? Even in pve, races from oposite faction work/figth against their own race.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's nothing you can't do already given how easy it is to level the other faction 100.<br />
<br />
I even had some one switch faction alts to compliment me on some WPVP the other night...<br />
<br />
Besides, given the utter dominance of Horde at high end raiding, I am demanding better Alliance racials so that people won't feel forced to go Horde to be able to compete.<br />

This is as expected I think. Actually the swamp area at south of Tanaan is tiny even when you are just on foot.<br />
<br />
I just tried Druid travel form on the PTR and it's completely broken. The icon popped up but you stay in humanoid form. You can even mount up with the travel form icon indicating immunity to polymorph. The only way to fly is with an appropriate mount like everyone else :(.</div></div><hr />

Flying shouldnt even be in, yet they caved to the kids and put it in anywayas. Now theyre making it so you can just buy it. roflmao.

I love that failing a ship mission doesnt even do anything. no penalty whatsoever roflmao. Good thing I have 25000 oil cause that was nerfed into the ground too. <br />
<br />
Today i failed a raid mission and was disappointed, then i looked and it was right back up HAHAHA. same one, same cost, same duration.. same damn mission. So you fail it and you can just redo it over and over? With my 25000 oil at the cost of 100 oil each i figure ill never care about whether or not i pass one or have good ships cause ill do it eventually anyways. <br />

You had OP classes, you had weak classes. Occasionally you would see a PvP video of a guy raping with a weak class and all was fun. Then blizzard decided they wanted to balance a game that has no business being balanced, because everyone felt they deserved to win no matter how underpowered their spec was or irrelevant. So what was blizzards response eventually? Make all the classes the same. Give them all short cool downs that can be spammed ever minute or two. Give everyone a stun, give everyone a heal, give everyone an escape, give everyone a crowd control ability.<br />
<br />
When did RPG's (role playing game) turn into a game where balance should be the prime objective. Every class had a unique function to a group that made you want them there. Now unless every class is within 2k dps of each other people just whine and cry. Unless the top arena bracket has a huge variety of classes people get upset about the balance. I miss the days of certain classes just doing things better than others. All this min maxing ruined the fun aspect of the game. Now it just becomes a game of find the relevant guide on line and hit the buttons like they tell you to. But good luck trying to do that on your own now a days, because people have zero patience for people who want to theory craft for them-self. They want max dps all the time. They want to plow through all the content as fast as they can, so they can sit back and whine about how much content they dont have.<br />
<br />
Blizzard didnt ruin the game, its fans did. Sure Bliz should add more content to the game and stop making us pay for a subscription if they arent going to update the game. But at the end of the day, the same content would hold most people over till the next expansion if people didnt look up guides online on where to stand, what buttons to push, where to spec their talents, what stats to prioritize, etc. We did this to ourself. We ruined a game that was based on class exploration and trial and error by trying to turn it into a weekly chore where the only thing we care about is &quot;loot&quot;.</div></div><hr />
