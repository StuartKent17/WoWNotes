This is hard-mode tuning. Hodir was considered mathematically impossible to defeat at 2 minutes, and Iron Council hardmode has only been killed with the help of pets tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both seem to be valid nerfs.<br />

<br />
Consideering Hodir was mathematically impossible without glitching (call it what you want) a world buff and taking it to raid in order to beat the timer by .03 seconds I would say this is highly warranted and needed. We'll see how the extra minute adds up.</div></div><hr />

Overall... pretty fair. Personally, I fully expected the Hodir fix after the Ensidia drama. I'm not surprised at the Thorim fix either, this is probably the main cause of wipes in the gauntlet at the moment. That said, this will of course make the hardmode quite a bit easier to activate as it makes the gauntlet a LOT safer. Anyone have any details on the Vezax trash adjustments? Like, perhaps fixing the teleporting rogues?<br />
<br />
Also lol @ the rooster mount. Seriously, I hope it's not just some TCG-only thing like the spectral tiger... won't hold my breath though. (edit: ohhh, looks like it is :( )</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nanite</div><div class="date">2009-05-04, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How in gods name do they manage to nerf uldar every freaking day? I mean I can understand making it more accessible in the beginning and making hard modes an actual challenge but this is getting more ridicules that Keal'thas's storyline. It seems every time someone kills a hard mode they nerf all the normal modes, this is a truly sad day in WoW when they deside to completely forgo any skill involved in doing a raid. <br />
<br />
Don't respond with but this is only SSC/TK because even freaking kara was harder than this pile of decaying dog deification that these delirious devils decide to put out as content. Doing uldar the first day it came out was a joke, we downed every boss up to mimir no problem but he was bugged. That was fixed and boom the rest of the instance went down, now combine with the improved gear and familiarity of the instance it is a joke. Uldar feels easier a few weeks in than even naxx did and with our gear going up and the difficulty going down it has become a pain. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately all the hard modes are borderline impossible requiring either game mechanic abuse or literally perfect play from every member, which can be expected up to a point but the fact is that their is no middle ground of content. Their is simply bash your mangled face against you keyboard for another night knowing that the scabs wont peel until after you have collected your shiny purples or the alternative only beatable through mandatory exploitation as well as perfect game play. <br />
<br />
Fortunatlly pvp is in a slightly better state hopefully that will hold me off from having to socialize with the outside world long enough for me to chew a bottle of sleeping pills like the sweet release from this constant cycle of nerfs.</div></div><hr />

I admit to the current hard modes being hard as hell, so hard as a matter a fact they required bugs/exploitations to do. My issue is that toning the dmg of something 25% or making the timer 2minutes doesn't make up for a lack of difficulty. Just like agalon being on a 1hour despawn doesn/t mean that the 2 months it takes for a guild to down him is due to his difficulty.<br />
<br />
What I am saying is that blizz saying that hard modes are for the pro players is like saying that the 2kilometer is for the marathoner who shot himself in the foot, so that he would not be on the far end of the bell curve.</div></div><hr />

I mean I can understand making it more accessible in the beginning and making hard modes an actual challenge but this is getting more ridicules that Keal'thas's storyline. It seems every time someone kills a hard mode they nerf all the normal modes, this is a truly sad day in WoW when they deside to completely forgo any skill involved in doing a raid. <br />
<br />
Don't respond with but this is only SSC/TK because even freaking kara was harder than this pile of decaying dog deification that these delirious devils decide to put out as content. Doing uldar the first day it came out was a joke, we downed every boss up to mimir no problem but he was bugged. That was fixed and boom the rest of the instance went down, now combine with the improved gear and familiarity of the instance it is a joke. Uldar feels easier a few weeks in than even naxx did and with our gear going up and the difficulty going down it has become a pain. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately all the hard modes are borderline impossible requiring either game mechanic abuse or literally perfect play from every member, which can be expected up to a point but the fact is that their is no middle ground of content. Their is simply bash your mangled face against you keyboard for another night knowing that the scabs wont peel until after you have collected your shiny purples or the alternative only beatable through mandatory exploitation as well as perfect game play. <br />

Fortunatlly pvp is in a slightly better state hopefully that will hold me off from having to socialize with the outside world long enough for me to chew a bottle of sleeping pills like the sweet release from this constant cycle of nerfs.<br />

I honestly feel like WoW has adopted the no child left behind policy and waits till everyone has nearly best-in-slot to release a new expantion. I remember walking through IF and seeing almost every person having 4/5val be4 Uldar and i am seeing the same thing happen now. The simple fact that only having one instance with one list of gear available has resulted in anyone who is either half decent or willing to bash they head against content long enough getting gear. Before the big surprise instance i suspect to be one of another million drones in the exact same gear, maybe a few peices better due to hard mode kils but the upgrade from Naxx-&gt;Uldar gear is not that impressive,.<br />
<br />
It just feels like all the differences between bad and good players have been removed. I dont mean casual because i have seen some pro casuals, but just bad. This is the way the game will work i guess.<br />
<br />
---To everyone who says stop playing---<br />
This is always the immediate response to anyone who takes any issue with the game MMO's are meant to evolve and the players voice is supposed to be one of the driving factors voicing your feelings about the direction the game is going is how change is made. Also its not just wow that has suffered the pain of the bad, almost every game that has come out MMO or otherwise has had the problem beating itself over the head with the retard stick so that the masses can enjoy it. I thank you all for my free CS kills but I cant get over the negative influence that catering to bads has on the game.<br />

1. I highly doubt people are going to be able to bang their head against Algalon and beat him.<br />
2. Same with hard modes. Try 25 man Mimiron Hard Mode sometime. Oh, also try to remove Thorim from the Yogg-Saron encounter and tell me what you think.<br />
3. You spelled Ulduar wrong in your signature.<br />
4. If you don't enjoy the game, stop playing it. Go play another MMO. It's Blizzard's game, they'll make it how they want. I personally enjoy it, you don't have to.</div></div><hr />

Not going to happen for a while tbh the reason the tiger is so expensive is becasue the card set is old and way out of date.<br />
There are very little tigers still around so thats the reasoning for high price.<br />

although this baby will go for a fair amount as it is just totally fucking stupid :)<br />

'Original' tier content however denied so many more players 'their enjoyment' then today's PvE environment. You, Sir, have very flawed argumentation.<br />

<br />
Auriaya was pretty easy, the pounce from the feral protector nerf is a ease of life thing, I like those nerfs. But was the swarm really that bad? I never saw anyone die from it. It was only the combination of pounce/swarm/fear that killed people. (And the boss was easy enough that when that happens you still killed her.)<br />

Translation: <br />
<br />
I try to keep my ingame identity a secret to completely hide the fact that I've not actually got past freya and my claims of clearing half the content in a day is a complete lie. By hiding these details, no one will have much fire power against me whilst I whine about the difficulty of an instance I have yet to complete in normal mode (let alone hard). I don't like to mix my in-game life or RL with my forum activities, even though a few hours ago I had details of what server I play on as well as my &quot;alt's&quot; name in my signature, and I have made my email address public.<br />
<br />
&lt;/translation&gt;<br />
<br />
Blizzard have worked harder than they ever have with their normal mode/hard mode tuning of Ulduar, which is far more difficult than simply adding cock-block gear checks and raid stacking bosses as a form of &quot;difficulty&quot;.</div></div><hr />
