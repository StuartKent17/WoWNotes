<meta name="description" content="More 2.4.3 testing on PTRs 
It looks like we won't get the 2.4.3 patch today, according to a reply to a bug report from Hortus there is already another PTR build on the work and it's very unlikely we'll see the 2.4.3 deployed on live realms this week. 
Patch 2.4.3 PTR Notes and Undocumented Changes 
 
 
 
Thanks for the report Samdog, it looks like this is already fixed in the next PTR build, please let me know if it continues after the next patch.

They're also taking quite a bit of time with 2.4.3, oh well. Also too bad that my server has extended maintenance.</div></div><hr />

Yep, your not the only one. Not even worth a read imo. There are much better games to get into if you're serious about e-sports.</div></div><hr />

No, it IS an OLD comic. I downloaded all comics from the official site a few month ago and guess what? This one is among them.</div></div><hr />

And I know it's old because I happen to look at the artist's homepage semi-regularly. [And I'm not quite sure if linking to it would be... appreciated around here.]</div></div><hr />
