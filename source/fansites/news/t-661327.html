In the Flame Leviathan encounter, the Tower of Life buff will no longer remain active after the Tower of Life has been destroyed. <br />
<br />
Several changes have been made to the Seaforium Bombs and Huge Seaforium Bombs:<br />
Seaforium Bombs and Huge Seaforium Bombs will now do less damage to players.<br />
Seaforium Bombs and Huge Seaforium Bombs will now do more siege damage.<br />
The respawn timer on Seaforium Bombs and Huge Seaforium Bombs have been reduced.<br />
<br />
<br />
Icecrown Citadel will have at least 31 Bosses<br />
This is the quote of the day, in a post about tanking Ghostcrawler hinted at the amount of encounters in Icecrown Citadel, the raid instance of Patch 3.3. <br />
I don't know that I would say we want tanking niches. I ultimately am agreeing with what you're saying, but once we say &quot;tanking niches&quot; players have visions of the DK who parks outside of Icecrown until boss 4, 17 and 31 (yes, IC is that big). <br />
<br />
Season 7 might start after another patch<br />
Apparently, Season 7 won't start before a few balancing issues are adressed, I guess we can expect a minor patch &quot;soon&quot; and arena teams still have a few more weeks to compete in the current season. <br />
We are going to fix the specific scenario where a PvP paladin with a Prot build but spell power gear can heal for more than a Holy build in the same gear. We want to do this without messing up the Prot paladin trying to tank in PvE.<br />
<br />
We will probably not make this change before the end of the current Arena season, but you can be thinking about your teams for season 7 with this change in mind. <br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
&quot;Tank and Spank&quot; encounters<br />
We aren't trying to make the fights easy necessarily, but we are trying to challenge the tanks and the raid in ways other than just pounding the tank as hard as we can such that cooldowns (from the healers even) and big heals become the only things that matter. Those are fine for some fights, just as having a tank and spank once in awhile is fine. The problem with Ulduar is that too many of the fights came down to these huge hits such that other parts of tanking (and healing) became pushed to the side. For example, nobody is as worried about being a mana sponge these days because mana isn't generally limiting and tanks can generally be destroyed in two hits. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19110293530-33-is-the-age-of-the-warriors.html))<br />
<br />
PvE design for Tanking<br />
Nah. Too many of you are trying to solve the tanking puzzle in one of two ways: find the best class to tank to make things easier for you, or bring one of every tank so that you have the bases covered. Neither of those is our design.<br />
<br />
Our design is that you can pick an MT and 1-3 OTs (depending on the content) and be able to beat the encounters, assuming those players have a reasonable amount of skill and gear. The balance has to be close enough that no matter which class you pick as a tank that you can still make progress. Generally that works out okay because players have beaten the content with all four tanks. There are some situations, especially on hard modes, where choosing one tank makes the encounter much easier than on others. We're okay with it being &quot;easier,&quot; but we don't want it to be &quot;much easier&quot; and we don't want it to happen too often or always favor the same class. If we thought we had nailed tank balance we wouldn't still be tweaking numbers and talents.<br />
<br />
For many of you though, learning the encounters, learning to coordinate better or getting better gear will improve your chances far more than picking &quot;the best&quot; tank class. That's not true of every guild, but it is probably true for most of them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19110293530-33-is-the-age-of-the-warriors.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking classes homogenization and tanking niches<br />
We understand that there is a segment of the community that wants to see all tank numbers virtually identical to each other on all fights. We see requests for DKs to block and druids to parry and for every class to have an equivalent snap-aggro move for single target and AE fights, etc. That's just not the direction we want to take the game. We want your group to do things a little differently if you have a bear instead of a paladin tank. We want that if you've played a DK throughout LK to have to learn and adapt to class differences if you choose to reroll a warrior. We want the numbers to be close enough so that a group that runs with tank X doesn't feel at a serious disadvantage on specific fights. But we aren't trying to make everyone the same. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19110293530-33-is-the-age-of-the-warriors.html))<br />
<br />
[...] I don't know that I would say we want tanking niches. I ultimately am agreeing with what you're saying, but once we say &quot;tanking niches&quot; players have visions of the DK who parks outside of Icecrown until boss 4, 17 and 31 (yes, IC is that big).<br />
<br />
I totally agree that no tank can be the worst at everything. What you have to remember though is that &quot;everything&quot; is generally defined as the current raid content. Coliseum isn't a large raid. If there are 5 bosses and 4 tanks then it seems that even in the best case that someone might be &quot;the best&quot; on 2 of them and everyone else is &quot;the best&quot; on 1. (And honestly, we don't design raid encounters with that goal in mind -- they have enough constraints on them already.)<br />
<br />
Again, the goal is &quot;close enough&quot; and the mushiness of that definition is intended. For some groups, having a tank that is &quot;5% harder to heal&quot; (whatever that means) is acceptable and perhaps not even detectable. We just need to avoid the extreme situation where the guild that feels gimp because their MT is a paladin (or whatever) and paladins have a lot of liabilities on the current raid content to the extent where that player is getting replaced on more than just a couple of fights. (And I should add by knowledgeable raid leadership, and not just the Naxx pug guy that read on the forums that bears are the best tank and so only accepts bears.)

Wild Growth Bugs<br />
I was going to post that we fixed this, because we did. But I'm glad that I didn't because sometime during the 3.2 patch it broke again. <br />
<br />
Sometimes when we don't address simple things head on, it's for reasons like this. We'll try to get it fixed (again) as soon as we understand what happened. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/18312417096-wildgrowth-issue-getting-fixed-round-2.html))<br />

Arcane Mages<br />
I think mana issues and talent tree bloat are quality of life issues. They are things we need to fix, but players would play Arcane without those changes if the damage was good.<br />
<br />
Raid utility would help, I agree.<br />
<br />
The problem with buffing Arcane's damage is that so many of the changes could be used to get big Arcane Barrage + PoM &quot;something&quot; back to back and 'splode someone in 2 shots again (or maybe 4 shots if you get another Barrage and Fireblast). We need to buff Arcane through other spells that can help sustained but not burst damage. That might mean going to higher stacks of Blast or something, but that could be a PvP nerf. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19110026161-how-you-can-help-arcane-mages.html))<br />
<br />
[...] Arcane could have a talent to make all of their Arcane spells 50% cheaper, but if its dps is far behind Fire, you aren't going to see many players choose Arcane except on say fights like Vezax. It might be true if you were purposely avoiding using a high damage, expensive spell in order to conserve mana. Realistically, I don't see that happening.<br />
<br />
Now you can certainly have a model where Arcane did great damage for 2 minutes and then ran out of mana so that sustained damage was low over the course of a 4 minute fight. But that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about mages feeling like Arcane is a legitimate option to Fire, which it was pretty close to in the early days of Lich King.

Prot Paladin healing in PvP / Touched by the Light<br />
We are going to fix the specific scenario where a PvP paladin with a Prot build but spell power gear can heal for more than a Holy build in the same gear. We want to do this without messing up the Prot paladin trying to tank in PvE.<br />
<br />
We will probably not make this change before the end of the current Arena season, but you can be thinking about your teams for season 7 with this change in mind. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19110155361-cannot-kill-self-healing-prot-pallys.html))<br />
<br />
[...] Touched by the Light helps to solve a specific problem which is that paladins do both physical and magical damage and Prot paladins need both for threat (and damage). It works fine when the paladin is in tanking gear, and in fact was designed so that paladins wouldn't need to mix tanking gear with caster gear as they did in the past.<br />
<br />
It is not balanced for a Prot paladin who decides to wear spell power gear. At that point you're double-dipping.<br />
<br />
We have no problem with Prot paladins in PvP, but they need to be there because their survivability is an asset, not because they can out-heal an entire tree dedicated to healing.<br />
<br />
There is a fine line between creative use of game mechanics and something that goes against our vision for the game. It's always going to be subjective. If the Retribution tree ended up being better at tanking than the Protection tree, or the Shadow priest was a better healer than the Disc tree, or the Marks hunter had a more powerful pet than the BM hunter, we'd take similar action. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19110155361-cannot-kill-self-healing-prot-pallys.html))<br />
<br />
Balancing Holy and Prot paladins in PvP<br />
As Affix said, if Prot paladins are impossible to kill because of their healing potential, the answer is not to make Holy paladins even more powerful than that.<br />
<br />
We have no problem if Prot paladins are hard to kill like Prot warriors or bear druids are hard to kill. But I don't think that's really what we're talking about. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19110155361-cannot-kill-self-healing-prot-pallys.html))<br />
<br />
Something is wrong with the game!<br />
You might want to read that before you complain about it on official forums (or anywhere else actually). <br />
If there is something you think is wrong with the game that we have't addressed, usually one of the following is true:<br />
<br />
1) We don't think something is wrong. In this case, repeatedly posting the same thing over and over is unlikely to change our minds.<br />
<br />
2) We think something is wrong, but we aren't ready to announce a change yet. This could be because we don't know how we want to fix it yet, we know how we want to fix it but require new tech to implement it, or because the change is going to take awhile.<br />
<br />
In both of these cases, posting the same thing over and over again or bumping a thread when you have no new information to add isn't going to have the effect you're looking for. The goal often seems to be to post over an over either because you're so angry you can't take it anymore, or because you're stubborn and are looking for that blue post that finally says &quot;here's how we're going to buff you.&quot; That happens, but it doesn't happen that often, and in those cases it is always because we agree something is a problem, not because you wore us down.<br />
<br />
I know some of you just want a thumb's up or thumb's down answer on a community question or issue, but even that is beyond what we want to do with these forums. We don't have the time nor inclination to respond to every issue, let alone every thread. Furthermore, simple answers are rarely enough for a design-savy community that wants to know why, wants to explore edge-cases or perhaps even wants to see hard proof. Short blue answers rarely &quot;solve&quot; anything and more often throw fuel on a fire.<br />
<br />
Here is how the process should ideally work: If you have an issue, bring it up. See if other players agree with you. If they disagree, don't shut them out. Once you've explored the issue a little bit, you've done your job. You don't need to keep starting new topics on the same issue nor bumping those already so long that no reasonable person is going to read them (though I try to).<br />
<br />
Sometimes we'll respond to a topic and sometimes we won't. But given the realities of developer time and the number of WoW players out there (even the minority of forum-posting ones) you should interpret those responses as almost random and not suggestive of a topic's severity or merit.</div></div><hr />

Stop being such a downer and be a little bit of a realist. Sure they released an underwhelming patch to keep the playerbase occupied while they're working on Icecrown but I suspect this team has been working on icecrown since the release of WotLK.<br />
<br />
If Icecrown would have been ready by now I bet 3.2 would've included Icecrown and not ToC with a possible smaller instance after it to keep the playerbase occupied until the release of Cataclysm much like what happened with Sunwell in BC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can definitly see them spending alot more time on the Icecrown Citadel than Ulduar. The expension pack is Wrath of the Lich King afterall, and so I would suspect they would put the most time and effort into maing his instance the best of the expansion, kinda like Illidan and the Black Temple was arguably the best expansion of BC.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong though, I wouldn't be *entirely* surprised if Icecrown was released with 80% of the bosses being reskins though...</div></div><hr />

Ignoreing that, they're said multiple times that the problem isn't that they don't have enough servers, but that the current tech currently borders on impossibility of making it work. You can't just &quot;get more servers&quot; or you'd be incredibly spread out and have terrible lag anyway. It's like saying &quot;'We don't have enough room in our stadium for all the people who want to watch the Football game.' 'Solution! build more football stadiums!'&quot;</div></div><hr />

This would be funnier if it made any type of sense.<br />
<br />
It would make sense if you said &quot;IC has 31 bosses but a high level of skill is not necessary to defeat any of them&quot; it would make sense, but because that doesn't have a nice ring to it and also sucks, you get not one, but two thumbs down for your comment.<br />

If this is the case then Blizz is out of ideas and the next xpac is a long ways away. If they really implement a raid with 31 bosses expect to be raiding it for at least a year.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
your icon says Shaman.. yet you don't know about the Mail Enhancement(lol) issue? Armor pen sucks yet.. all the mail gear is LOADED with it. Now, if the 31 boss thing is true I suspect for the first time in WotLk everyone will be covered in terms of drops (Enhance didn't have any weapon upgrades from OS to naxx 25 i think) <br />
<br />
Now I'm sure this will be a good ol' fashion Blizz raid where there is multiple optional bosses and maybe a couple Hardmode only bosses (mal'ganis?). Maybe even some &quot;Give the Hardcores a cookie&quot; type bosses which are only accessible after defeating the Lich King (obtaining a key to get to the special boss).</div></div><hr />

The problem of the arcane mage is, they only f*** hard for 2 minutes... but in this time a got mage could deal massive dmg. <br />
Give arcane concentration a buff, or give this buff mind mastery. maybe instead of 10% chance not to lose mana, we say 25% chance... and if this spells crits it could be a 50% chance<br />

1. There may be 31 bosses -&gt;<br />

4. Casuals QQ about not being able to do 31 bosses, let alone 124. -&gt;<br />
5. Rumour goes back to 31, -&gt;<br />
6. Rumour starts that there will be 4 bosses requiring everyone to have all types of resistance gear, hardcores rejoice -&gt;<br />
7. Casuals fire up, -&gt;<br />
8. T10 are leaked, community bitches about it being re-modelled T2, despite it just being a rumour -&gt;<br />
9. Rumour evolves into the Icecrown being back to a 40 man raid, -&gt;<br />
10. Blizz gets a forum post started asking why lvl31's are being given free epics, -&gt;<br />
11. Some clown threatens Blizz with a discrimination lawsuit asking why anyone aged over 31 years old and over is rumoured to not be able to have their account zone into the Icecrown instance.<br />

We are going to fix the specific scenario where a PvP paladin with a Prot build but spell power gear can heal for more than a Holy build in the same gear. We want to do this without messing up the Prot paladin trying to tank in PvE.<br />

We will probably not make this change before the end of the current Arena season, but you can be thinking about your teams for season 7 with this change in mind. <br />

This is the quote of the day, in a post about tanking Ghostcrawler hinted at the amount of encounters in Icecrown Citadel, the raid instance of Patch 3.3. <br />
I don't know that I would say we want tanking niches. I ultimately am agreeing with what you're saying, but once we say &quot;tanking niches&quot; players have visions of the DK who parks outside of Icecrown until boss 4, 17 and 31 (yes, IC is that big). <br />
<br />
<br />
31 ? o_O<br />
<br />
And, ulduar is, what 14-15?<br />
<br />
If it also has hard modes, that'll be taking so much time that most guilds won't have finished much before the next expansion.<br />
<br />
What's another option, is that a &quot;lot&quot; of bosses will actually be optional - unlike black temple.<br />
Lets say you only need to kill 12-14 bosses to reach arthas, while the others are all optional, and considerably HARDER. e.g. hardmode bosses loose from the content, but which will help you gear up and get achievements.</div></div><hr />

what im thinking is there might be 32 bosses and itll be divided up into wings (evenly distributed thats why i added one)<br />
so it might be<br />
<br />
Scourge Wing<br />
Vrykul Wing<br />
Nerubian Wing<br />
Final Wing<br />
<br />
so 8 bosses per wing<br />
so the only people youll see with loot from the final wing is guys that beat the other 3 wings and then trashed arthas and his elite goons</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Naxx entrance content, Ulduar was awesome, can't be discussed nerfs wasn't allright, the fact that you suck and didn't get pass XT before everything was nerfed didn't make it less of an instance for people who can play.<br />
<br />
3.2 &quot;total awfullness &quot; They just introduced a new way of raiding have you experienced that yet? No, ofc you can disagree with the way they are releasing the bossees. But maybe just maybe there is something interesting on heroic mode, but then again a person that didn't experience Uldars pure content will probably just keep farming easy modes until the rest is nerfed. <br />

FFXI's Zeni Notorious Monsters (http://wiki.ffxiclopedia.org/wiki/Zeni_Notorious_Monsters) had the exact same number of bosses. Most likely the biggest raid instance ever made in an mmo.<br />

Maybe Blizzard laying out the instance same way too (click the link) - 31 bosses wouldn't make really sense otherwise. <br />

You enter IC, which is single Room ( no trash! ). Ofc Arthas will be immune to all your attacks, but he will summon 31 bosses for you ( because he obliviously doesn't know that kiling them will make him killable ). And then, when you finally smash all the lolbosses you can confront Arthas. <br />

Yes idd, rofl :D<br />
You sir, just won the interwebz :D<br />

OT: I think 31 bosses (read, not &quot;boss-encounters) seems like a nice alternative and might bring back some of the epicness I kinda felt we lost during WotLk. I would like to get back to the state where you only &quot;heard&quot; about the end boss and very few dedicated guilds managed to kill it, kinda like Algalon just not a hardmode boss. To me this seem very optimistic and would like to see a scenario like this go live. :)<br />

XD Arthas is just the body and part of him that takes stupid decisions, the real threat has and will always be Nerzhul, the original lich king, and the guy who actually thinks instead of throwing bond-like tantrums.<br />
<br />
And keep in mind, they also counted 4 horsemen in naxx as 4 separate bosses, so while there might be 31 bosses, its unlikely he means 31 encounters.<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought so too because everything pointed to that but after reading Arthas - Rise of the Lich King youll know that:<br />
<br />
Spoiler:<br />
Arthas kills the part of him inside which is Ner'zhul as well as the little boy (his innocent, childly, good and &quot;still-able-to-love&quot; side)<br />
<br />
So the Lich King which we encounter in WotLK is in fact just Arthas :)</div></div><hr />

3-4 KT's , 6 different color coded Hoggers, 4 sprinkled Illidans, 3 Kael'thas for good measure, 3 back to back to back Anub'Arak's, 5 Archimondes and 5 dragon flight shades + 1 Lich King.<br />

Though I still feel fairly certain IC will be huge, albeit perhaps not 31 bosses.<br />
I'd love to see 20 bosses though, maybe like 13 progression and an addition 7ish hardmode/optional bosses.<br />
Mmmm, IC sounds delicious.</div></div><hr />

First, he wanted to make sure that nobody though it's just a typo or an example, because he knew of course that no one would believe him in the first place when I just drop some numbers.<br />
<br />
So I think his statement about the yogg achievment is just shabby excuse and IC will have around 31 bosses actually.</div></div><hr />

In my opinion it's the best content to be added to the game yet. The enviroments and models and texturing and designs all look great in difference to TBC and to a lesser extent Vanilla, the enviroment transitions all make SENSE instead of red mountains suddenly becoming blue and wouups you are in a marsh coming out of nowhere. There is a lot more detail, the instances look great and feel great to play. Oh and they have written some gorgeous music as well :) <br />
Oh Ulduar is too easy? Have you beaten Yogg +0 yet and how long did that take? Instead of starting with a brickwall they have started with easier raids that everyone can participate in and gradually heightened the curve. I'm a Naxx noob and haven't even seen Ulduar except the first boss yet so it seems like it is working aight? And yeah people are still wiping in Naxx so...<br />
<br />
In my opinion this expansion is miles above TBC</div></div><hr />

I was the person who set the original Kill Yogg achievement to 22 minutes too. Just sayin'. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
so it'll be 15 bosses, since the achievement is 16 minutes shorter than set beforehand. <br />
31 - 16 = 15<br />

Eh, i feel you just started to play, for those among us that remember vanila, at the end 95% of the people didn't get the last bosses killed in there and still today they are hard, if you look at what we have now, it's *bleep* easy to get to the end content if you commit yourself a little bit. <br />
<br />
I feel ,like some have already written before, it will be max 16 to 20 encounters with in total maybe 31 bosses. &gt;:( the only thing that i hope is not going to happen is that we get all the old boss encounters back again, maybe a little bit harder, GIVE NEW STYLE ENCOUNTERS AND NEW ABBILITIES i *bleep* don't care getting special gear for a boss encounter just to get past it but if every average casual can walk in there unprepared, then it would be a big fail. :-\<br />
<br />
One thing i really hope is that they take the badge gathering out of getting the tiers, go back to the way it's supposed to be, give emblems from raids not from badges. &gt;:(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, some bosses that could appear in IC:<br />
-Arthas<br />
-Sindragosa*<br />
-Kel'Thuzad (maybe)*<br />
-Anub'arak (maybe)*<br />
-Pai Stormbringer<br />
-Ul'haik Hadonot<br />
-The last two Princes of San'layn; Theraldis and Atherann<br />
-The Queen of the Val'kyrs (if there is one :p)<br />
-The undead body (or skeleton) of Arugal riding a zombie version of Fenrus the Devourer<br />
-A massive abomination stitched together from corpses of Storm Giants, Frost Giants and Fire Giants.<br />
-Saurfang Jr. the Death Knight<br />
-Bolvar the Death Knight<br />
-The Spirits of Darkmaster Gandling and Baron Rivendare in the same body, switching between Runeblade and Headmaster's Charge, with abilities fitting the current spirit in charge of the body.<br />
-The Forgotten One that Anub'arak and Arthas killed, now raised as an undead.<br />
-Vargul version of King Ymiron. &quot;What... awaits me... now?&quot;<br />
-Kael'thas Sunstrider &quot;Don't look so smug! I know what you're thinking, but the Sunwell was merely a set back. Did you honestly believe I would trust the future to some giant, eredar fool?? Hahahaha... Oh no, no, no, he was merely an instrument, a stepping stone to a much larger plan! It has all led to this...and this time, you will not interfere&quot; The second time we killed him he was being kept alive by fel magic. Now he is undead.<br />
-The Leader of the Gargoyles. During Arthas' first visit to Northrend (Frostmourne, Mal'Ganis and such) he brought back Gargoyles to help him later with the assault on Quel'Thalas. Their origin is currently pretty much unknown, except that they are native to Northrend.<br />
-Scarlet Onsalught attack on the Citadel, with the same kind of plan used by the Argent Crusade, 'send in the most powerful ones' so Barean Westwind and a couple of other named Scarlets, maybe Landgren. And it's like a raid vs raid, the Scarlet Onsalught's number in there is equal to your raid size.<br />
-After all are dead, Barean Westwind turns into Mal'Ganis and fights a while, but teleports* and leaves the 'Scarlet Onslaught Treasure Chest' unwatched.<br />
-Thule Ravenclaw and his undead Gnolls<br />
-King Leoric, the Skeleton King<br />
-Captain Falric. You may know him just as The Captain, unless you have read the Arthas novel. He is the guy that followed Arthas everywhere in wc3, and is still following him in death.<br />
-Dentarg, Ner'zhul's ogre from WC2, possibly a combination of a two-headed ogre and an abomination.<br />
-Undead Agamaggan. As you obviously know, the Scourge reside in RFD, once a major 'city' of the Quillboar. It is possible that with the necromantic power of the Scourge, they could raise Agamaggan just like the Furbolgs did with Ursoc.<br />
-Chargla Razorflank, the reason why the Scourge got a foothold in Kalimdor, ex-leader of the Quillboars, <br />
-The Scourge Banshee Queen. They still have banshees. Why not a queen?<br />
-The Mother Spider. &quot;Maexxna — born deep within the mountains of Northrend many ages ago, she was captured within the dread citadel Naxxramas, where she gives birth to her brood, feeding them the corpses of all who dare venture too deeply into Naxxramas.&quot; now, think Maexxna's Mother.<br />
<br />
These are some ideas what could be in IC. Some are more likely to be there than others.<br />
<br />
The * next to some of the names could appear in the Lich King battle. I hope we also get to fight alongside good guys like Saurfang, Sylvanas, Muradin and Jaina. These I listed have personal buisness with Arthas/Lich King; Varok Saurfang's son was slain and his soul captured by the Lich King. Arthas charged into Quel'Thalas, killed almost everything, raised the slain as undead, destroyed the Capital, and tortured Sylvanas to death, just to raise her as a banshee, Muradin almost died because of Arthas, because of his foolishness that he didn't listen to the wise dwarf and went home when they saw that the runeblade (Frostmourne) was cursed. Jaina and Arthas had a romantic relationship, but he gave that up just to kill Mal'Ganis. Mal'Ganis could also be there, he hates the Lich King because he told Arthas (through Frostmourne) to kill him. Apparently dreadlords can't die, he just turned into bats and flew away ;) I guess he could come in the Lich King fight to help a bit, and also cause some shock in the Lich King. &quot;Mal'Ganis! I don't know how you survived but I...&quot;. And I hope players wont tank him, he oneshotted Saurfang the Younger, through his parry. At Wrathgate Saurfang Jr. had 200k hp. Still, he was killed in the cinematic, not in game, but Saurfang the Younger is more powerful than any single player atm, so I think High Overlord Saurfang/Muradin should tank him, while player tanks could tank Anub'arak and Kel'Thuzad. Sylvanas and Jaina could serve the purpose of weakening him with Blight Arrows and Random Spell, and also dealing damage. Mal'Ganis could be hostile (red name) but still not attackable nor would he attack players, at least not until Arthas is dead. Tirion and Darion should also be there, at least Tirion with the Ashbringer. Varian and Thrall aren't included because Varian is a retard and Thrall haven't met either Arthas or the Lich King personally (as far as I know). Lich King is showing up at Trial of the Crusader so Thrall will see him there I guess. Still, unless he kills any of Thrall's best friends he won't have any personal hate for him, but I guess his duty as the Warchief could be enough for him to come along. Varian is retarded because everything bad that happens in northrend, is the Horde's fault. Well, that is what he believes. One good thing would be if he comes to IC, the LK kills him, but I guess that won't happen.<br />
<br />
TLDR version of the above: Make Lich King fight epic with a lot of faction leaders helping you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also thought adding more instance servers would help fix it as well but perhaps im mistaken.<br />
<br />
However, Im paying for something that doesn't work. I think they should atleast give us reimbursment, or free game play for a certain period or ATLEAST lessen the price per month.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's like going to a car mechanic and telling them to replace a tire and all they do is put a patch over it and call it good only to have it break down several times costing you a fortune.<br />
<br />
If people are capable of providing you a service, then they need to find a way to please me (the customer) for they don't loose out on my business.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just saying.... Perhaps they REALLY are having some hard times fixing this. I believe all games reach this point, but at the same time I'm paying for something they said that would work.<br />
If it isn't, I would like some type of reimbursement for time wasted and things not working as they should. <br />
<br />
<br />
The majority of wow players are in a round about nice way (Stupid) and never read the forums. *Meaning the majority of those people are the major income for blizzard** <br />
<br />
They might not get why it is taking so long to fix the instances, etc etc (since they expect things to be working and don't read forums) WILL quite and move on. <br />
<br />
Keeping those stupid people (like myself) happy, will keep the revenue going. <br />
<br />

---Yes this is another post I know that others have addressed. But voicing my opinion is all that wow has allowed me to do since there isn't anything else to do *since everything is down*-----<br />

This, in Blizzards view is an epic failure. They have said it time and time again, they want people to see all their content. If only 5% of their population can see what they spent huge amounts of time and money one, it's a complete and total waste. Would you like to make a product that very few people can actually use? No, you're not. If you buy random Xbox/PS game and 5% of the people can get through it, it's not gonna review well because it's too hard and beating your head against a wall just isn't fun for most people. Get real and wake the F up. GOD I'm so sick of the total ignorance on this topic just because of the pure desire to be a unique snowflake. Why do you think they do hard modes? 10 mans and 25 mans and not 40s still? 40s, few people got it to see it, 25s more, 10s were wildly successful and now hard and normal modes everyone wins. People get in there and get to see all their hard work and there is a challenge left for the hard core.</div></div><hr />

I dont know about you but my guild clears ulduar with 3 hours (if done normal modes) thats 13 bosses (not including Algalon) Clearing 31 Bosses in IC citadel during a week aint that hard if u raid few hours every night like most serious raid guilds do.<br />
<br />
I personally dont care about some casual QQ. ''Aww soo many bosses we can never kill em all in 1 week'' thats why u have extended lockout option.<br />
<br />
And i personally think there will be alot of optional bosses like Ulduar start. You kill FL then u go kill XT and u can just skip 2 Ignis and Razorscale.<br />
Im guessing u can skip large portion of bosses in IC Citadel an dmaybe reach Lich King when killing lets say half of those bosses, but its just a theory. We never know before we actually see it.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't use much mana to begin with and with 500+ regen and the cooldown on the cast you could probably spam it and not see much mana drain period.<br />

<br />
Even it is 31 bosses, probably 20 of them are optional, 5 must be unblocked by defeating all hard modes every week, 3 are random and the other 3 are normal bosses with a suicide ability if you don't kill them before 10 minutes.</div></div><hr />

Ignoreing that, they're said multiple times that the problem isn't that they don't have enough servers, but that the current tech currently borders on impossibility of making it work. You can't just &quot;get more servers&quot; or you'd be incredibly spread out and have terrible lag anyway.

Assuming you get an average of 4 epics per boss that’s 124 epics PER RUN! That’s almost 5 epics per person, and that’s not even including trash. Let’s say there’s at least 4 – 6 trash pulls between you and each boss that means that the whole instance is going to have anywhere between 120 – 186 trash pulls. <br />
<br />
Also since these are “unique” bosses let assume that they have their own unique loot tables. Factoring out any hard mode/heroic differences in the loot tables I figure that they would have anywhere between 15 – 20 different pieces of loot that could drop off of any one boss. That is about 620 different epics that could possibly drop in the entire instance.<br />
<br />
Now there are only 10 classes each with 3 different specs, and only 17 pieces of gear that you could have equipped at any point in time (minus out tabard/shirt) that’s 510 different pieces of gear. So that tells me that there are enough epics to have a completely unique set for every class and every spec and then some.</div></div><hr />

Assuming you get an average of 4 epics per boss that&#146;s 124 epics PER RUN! That&#146;s almost 5 epics per person, and that&#146;s not even including trash. Let&#146;s say there&#146;s at least 4 &#150; 6 trash pulls between you and each boss that means that the whole instance is going to have anywhere between 120 &#150; 186 trash pulls. <br />
<br />
Also since these are &#147;unique&#148; bosses let assume that they have their own unique loot tables. Factoring out any hard mode/heroic differences in the loot tables I figure that they would have anywhere between 15 &#150; 20 different pieces of loot that could drop off of any one boss. That is about 620 different epics that could possibly drop in the entire instance.<br />
<br />
Now there are only 10 classes each with 3 different specs, and only 17 pieces of gear that you could have equipped at any point in time (minus out tabard/shirt) that&#146;s 510 different pieces of gear. So that tells me that there are enough epics to have a completely unique set for every class and every spec and then some.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i am assuming all your assumptions are wrong.</div></div><hr />

Pretty vague update on it. I've noticed that a lot of times when i try and cast WG it fails saying i'm out of range and i'm not sure if that is Healbot crapping on me or this specific bug - anyone have any details? it is annoying when it says the person is out of range or dead when they're not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have had this same issue on my resto druid. Its if you are using healbot and your are currently targeting a boss ( for example Razorscale ) it doesn't matter if you are clicking on the person next to you on healbot since your target is Razorscale and she is to far away the heal does not go through. Same with if you are targeting a dead player to brez them but trying to get a quick heal off first with WG. This bug only messes with WG as you can cast any other heal with no issue no matter who your current target is. My advice is to target yourself at all times and make your healing target your focus and turn on focus cast bars and such.</div></div><hr />

And have it be within the first 8 bosses, 1 boss after an impossible without BiS DPS race, meaning farm the first 6 bosses for 3 months to max everyone to be able to do boss 7 and then 8 is the must have 1000+ Resil boss. I smell excitement.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abani</div><div class="date">2009-08-11, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.<br />
We can all safely assume there are more bosses than Ulduar in Icecrown.<br />
<br />
31 is absolutely absurd unless there are some sort of mini-bosses involved.<br />
Twenty unique encounters is a bit more believable.<br />
<br />
Thirty-one bosses are sure a whole lot to fit into Icecrown Citadel. <br />
Unless there is also an Icecrown Cellar raid.<br />
And an Icecrown Sewers.<br />
And of course the Icecrown Ice Rink. <br />
<br />
Hmm, ice as an encounter mechanic would be a lot of fun actually. <br />
Taking a step, but keep sliding past your first step could be very difficult for a lot of players if environmental hazards were involved.<br />
<br />
Ooh what fun! Take the SUPREMUS fight, and add in slippery Ice covered ground. OHHHH. I can see raid leaders screaming, &quot;DON'T SLIDE INTO THE FIRES!&quot;<br />
Man. That would be something else.<br />
<br />
back on topic now. haha.<br />
<br />
If there were indeed a number as big as 31, I could see the entire zone being subject to raids. There are many other holds with doors that are shut.<br />
And there is the elusive Vyrkul Keep, I forget it's name, which everyone thought would be our 5man instance.<br />
It very well still could be one, but it also could have a raid in there if it wanted.<br />
<br />
If they reaaallly got creative, we could take the Ogrim's Hammer, and that silly.. lesser airship, and create a raid out of those (alliance and horde versions respectively).<br />
Fighting Sindragosa via airship could be cool if done right.. Perhaps give it two phases, one is the assault via airship. Where players are launched onto her back like FL, and the players attack her with the Airship's weaponry. And maybe on flying mounts like Malygos.<br />
<br />
Eventually we take her down and take the fight on land after the airship has taken too much damage to keep afloat.<br />
The fight is over if the Airship sustains too much damage before she does.<br />
Hmm.<br />
<br />
If only. But I would love to see those airships do something besides float around.<br />
Blizzard has access to a pretty killer zone, and could really do something unique if they wanted with it.<br />
<br />
But yes. If there were that many bosses, I could only see that done well with multiple raids either with separate or all the same cooldown<br />
(simply.. Icecrown Raid 10 and 25)<br />
<br />
Hey, they have said 3.3 is Icecrown, but they didn't say it was just Icecrown.<br />
I know I'm just dreaming, but man, if only we could go to a real Old Kingdom raid.<br />
<br />
My hopes for 3.3 are a lot of bosses like we've heard, but give us a unique approach.<br />
Space the raid out in a sort time based advance upon the citadel.<br />
<br />
First part we've got x many bosses, as Tirion and his champions begin their assault.<br />
<br />
Second phase of the assault involves fighting Arthas' best Lieutenants/Captains/or worse, as we must for whatever reason, before we can go to the Citadel itself. We fight them at various locations around Icecrown.<br />
<br />
Then we're at Icecrown Citadel, knocking on Arthas' door.<br />
Icecrown Citadel has mutiple wings, akin to Naxxramas.<br />
Arthas himself, is only available to fight, after weeks of real time. Similar to the Call of The Crusade.<br />
<br />
More dreaming, but I for one will greatly love if Blizzard at least spreads out of the raid's accessibility.(however it may go.). <br />
It is an excellent means of controlling content and making current loot more of a prize once you finally get it. <br />
I think it enriches the experience as long as it is timed correctly.<br />
<br />
Timing encounter unlocks would also make sense in accordance with the events/lore going on.<br />
We will have really big fight on our hands.</div></div><hr />

and Ice crown will prolly not be in wings, it'll have diffrent level floors. Arthas will offcourse be on the top level. <br />

A nathrezim can't be killed by anything other than its own kind. Which is why its the only known forbidden thing the nathrezim are sworn never to do. So Varimarthas, Balnaazar, Mal'Ganis, Tichondrius and all the rest are all still alive</div></div><hr />

Guys, so many of you are referring to the '31 bosses' Icecrown Citadel 'will have'.<br />
<br />
I really don't think he cites the number literally, but rather as an example. I'd be surprised if they knew how many bosses there will be from now, and even more so if there were that many. I believe he simply means that Icecrown Citadel will be larger than current raid zones, which I think is commendable.</div></div><hr />

For some groups, having a tank that is &quot;5% harder to heal&quot; (whatever that means) is acceptable and perhaps not even detectable. We just need to avoid the extreme situation where the guild that feels gimp because their MT is a paladin (or whatever) and paladins have a lot of liabilities on the current raid content to the extent where that player is getting replaced on more than just a couple of fights. (And I should add by knowledgeable raid leadership, and not just the Naxx pug guy that read on the forums that bears are the best tank and so only accepts bears.)

<br />
<br />
At what point was a bear ever 'better' than a paladin for ....well... anything?<br />
(and thats comming from a bear....) Just about every fight seems easier with a pally tank... so much so that I wind up DPS'ing more than tanking, even if Feral Tank is my main spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a TOTAL of THREE prot paladins in all FORTY FIVE TEAMS. The best part is, TWO of them were TANK SPECCED meaning they did nothing other stan stun healers and eat melee. there was ONE prot pally healer. <br />
<br />
Everyone else was ret or holy, holy being dominant. The healing paladins has the standard 51/20/0. This problem blizzard seems to think there is does not exist, according to the facts.<br />
<br />
As I stated before, prot healing is a fun gimmick spec, a creative use of game mechanics, and I applaud those who thought of it and are good at it. It is NOT a trend or a problem. <br />
<br />
I sometimes think blizzard does not look at the facts and just listens to whiners who happened to get pwned by these people in BGS. <br />
<br />
Whatever they decide to do I certainly hope it does not mess with TANKING prot because of them trying to fix a fake and non existant problem.</div></div><hr />
