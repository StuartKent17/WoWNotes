The past week has been crazy and I just couldn't report everything on the front page as soon as it was released.

The past week has been crazy and I just couldn't report everything on the front page as soon as it was released. However, I don't really like the idea of not reporting information and I went back through all the blue posts from last week to compile all the information released for each class. Blue posters did an amazing job this week and gave tons of details on the changes, you will probably see a lot of new stuff there depending on your class. They are located in their respective forum to make the discussion easier. <br />
<br />
If you're wondering how crazy it's been, we had an average of 10 000 forum posts each day for the past week. That's a forum post every 8 second, and that's more posts in a single day than during the first 6 months of the website. (And I'd like to take this opportunity to publicly hug the moderators for everything they did this week)<br />

The only reason they're delaying on the paladin changes is because they're trying to figure out a way to announce that they'll be removing paladin bubbles without causing mass panic and anarchy. :-*</div></div><hr />

There doesn't seem to be any favoritism towards them by Blizzard either (besides Lore of course, if you care about such things). <br />
In fact, Blizzard employees seem to make their fair share of jokes at the expense of paladins (probably because its what the community responds favorably to) not to mention the complete lack of any updates to the class in recent patches. <br />
And then there was that whole promise of a reworking of Ret never materialized beyond &quot;hey, we changed SoComm, that's a spec revamp right?&quot; from a while back.<br />
<br />
I've noticed a lot of suggestions that the Paladin thread will have the most amount of QQ because paladins are crybabies, but I'd be willing to wager there will be just as much, if not more, QQ from non-paladins in the thread if the class is anything less than deleted.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Wouldn't 'shapeshifting' simply refer to the ability to morph one's shape, not the duration or persistence of such a change?<br />
<br />
Arguably shifting forms emphasizes the idea of 'shapeshifter' more than staying in a single one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either that, or remove Bubble + HS.<br />
<br />
Should be interesting either way to see what Blizz has ready for their most favoured class!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Guess you weren't playing much in Vanilla <br />
<br />
<br />
No kidding. If the entire track record of paladin balancing ever since day one is the definition of &quot;Blizzard's Favorite Class&quot; then maybe they should do us all a favor and pick another favorite for the next five years.<br />
<br />
The way I've seen the wailing and gnashing of teeth going lately is seems that they might've picked Shamans for the honor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't really understand all the pally hate, they haven't been OP for a longer period than any other class has been OP. There doesn't seem to be any favoritism towards them by Blizzard either (besides Lore of course, if you care about such things). <br />
In fact, Blizzard employees seem to make their fair share of jokes at the expense of paladins (probably because its what the community responds favorably to) not to mention the complete lack of any updates to the class in recent patches. <br />
And then there was that whole promise of a reworking of Ret never materialized beyond &quot;hey, we changed SoComm, that's a spec revamp right?&quot; from a while back.<br />
<br />
I've noticed a lot of suggestions that the Paladin thread will have the most amount of QQ because paladins are crybabies, but I'd be willing to wager there will be just as much, if not more, QQ from non-paladins in the thread if the class is anything less than deleted.<br />
<br />
And it'd be warranted from paladins if they took an extra week to rework the class and didn't do an overhaul the extent to which such additional development time would indicate.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Pally hate exists because of mostly two reasons.<br />
<br />
1) Their attack/tanking mechanics were dramatically simplified for WotLK and caused a massive glut of paladins to appear everywhere; which was intentional on Blizzard's part when they mentioned in Blizzcon 2008 that they wanted Paladins to be a 'simple, appealing class' for new players to learn how to play in an MMO, assuming the lore around Paladins would appeal to them. They are, hence, popular and numerous and more often than not played by new players, so hated.<br />
<br />
2) People will always dislike defensive immunity. Offensive immunity is more welcome, in contrast (Cyclone is rarely angsted about). Things that interrupt the flow of offense and forcing you to switch targets against your favor, or use an otherwise-useless utility skill (Mass Dispel/Shattering Throw) will always cause people to angst.<br />
<br />
But you are absolutely right on the proportion of complaints that will arise when the Paladin preview will come out. As compared to what is seen on the official forums when previews were put out for all the other classes compared to what kind of traffic the official Paladin forums gets every day, the amount of gloating and jeering from other non-paladins vastly outdoes the actual QQ from paladins. The anti-paladin QQers will never notice this, or likely even care -- it'll just simply remain as one of the great ironies of the universe.</div></div><hr />

Bubble means nothing to me, but it'd destroy a big thing in PvE, if I'm tanking and I need to get rid of stacks quickly, that's incredibly helpful. I'd never be able to solo-tank things like Toravon if I didn't have a bubble. Then there's when I feel like bailing off of my flyer and bubble-land.</div></div><hr />

It has nothing to do with balance, PVE, PVP or this game.<br />

It's possible since it's also an AoE move that works as good on single targets, however I don't find it likely as its the ret paladin 51 point talent, not a baseline ability. Its right for it to be a powerful ability with a variety of uses.</div></div><hr />

I wish, I own a pally and think bubble is ridiculous, at least put a cooldown on all bubbles and what not even if u cast BoP on a friendly target.</div></div><hr />

Im very excited for these changes and I beleive Cataclysm looks better than any other WoW expansion to date. I am most excited for the Mage, Warlock, Rogue, and Druid changes. I am curious how the Paladin changes will be though. If the changes to holy are good enough I may start healing on him in Cataclysm again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anyone had to go back and try to level as a Ret Paladin before the 3.0 Changes, you would probably kill yourself.<br />
People just hate Paladins for the two weeks they were super OP at the end of Burning Crusade, and people just jump on the bandwagon to seem cool.<br />
<br />
I find it incredibly ironic that earlier in this thread I saw a rogue claim that Paladins are too easy to play. What's that Rogue rotation again?<br />
Oh...Mutilate &gt; HfB &gt; SnD &gt; Mutx2 &gt; Envenom....that is tough to play isn't it.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I predict that the Paladin changes will nerf us ridiculously, and we'll be back to the way we were in Burning Crusade. Honestly, I look forward to it. Then maybe I won't get hated on for playing a Paladin.</div></div><hr />

What class would you recommend to play in Cataclysm (Horde side with new race)? <br />
Which few so far favor (advantages, versatility, ease/simplicity) more towards PvP orientation?<br />

No one can predict that yet. Just like with WotLK, many of these new spells might not even make it to live. And those that do make it might get reworked so much that they'll be nothing like what's been announced now. Add to that that we know nothing of the new talent trees or potential new talents since this is just a small preview of what's actually in store.</div></div><hr />

Mages got it. It's called time warp. Paladins dont want bloodlust, it would just be another &quot;utility&quot; that keeps us from the things we want (like our pony!). If anything we'd get a battle rez as that hasnt been given to any other class yet and its still druid specific.</div></div><hr />

if you actually put all talent points in one tree its (maybe) OK, but if want to take up talents in other trees, you get no real benefit.<br />
<br />
say, in Elemental tree you get spell damage, but if you put points in Enhance, you will get Melee damage and Melee haste??? I don't know if Elemental shaman will melee also in cata...<br />

see mage or warlock for example, either way you will get Spell damage...</div></div><hr />

im pretty sure they said they were going to modify the amount of spell damage per talent point according to the dps they wanted the class to do, i.e. affl locks =1.5% per point ele shamans=2.0% per point. to counteract the problem with hybrid masteries.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
the mastery i think he's referring to is the first and second on the list, which everyone who points any points into the tree gets, it's when you put the majority of the points into one tree that you get the third for that tree.</div></div><hr />

We will be hated no matter what. Whether it is our poor DPS (think Vanilla &amp; TBC), our actually decent DPS (think now), our two-button tanking, healing, etc. It's just cool to hate paladins, we're not getting out of &quot;lolret&quot; or anything. The hate is there to stay.</div></div><hr />

Check the blueposts, that screenshot is months old and the latest information tells us you only get things in one tree.<br />
They added that because of this problem, it would be impossible to balance.</div></div><hr />
