Blue posts<br />
Dual specialization and itemization<br />
I think that is a valid point. You can come up with a lot of reasons why players might want more than two specs. However this is a new feature for us and we need to see what actually happens to the game as a result before we go nuts. Down below you mention the problem of casters rolling on items without hit and a lot of spirit just because it fits the criteria of ZOMG PURP + SPELLPOWER. Now imagine that someone wants to roll on an item because one of their many specs (assume for the sake of argument that they are all legitimately used) can use it. The whole &quot;I guess I can use that for an offspec&quot; becomes a much bigger deal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13723832302-healer-mechanics-discussion.html))<br />
<br />
Healer UI improvements<br />
I think there is a lot we can do to improve the default UI especially for healers. It won't solve every problem for players who use something Grid and Clique, but it can be a lot better. Just showing buffs and debuffs on the raid UI would be a nice improvement. There is a lot we can do here. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13723832302-healer-mechanics-discussion.html))<br />
<br />
Hit cap in WotLK<br />
We didn't put as much hit on gear as we did in Burning Crusade as it was frustrating for players who were already at cap to see tons of gear with more hit on it. There is plenty of hit gear, however. You'll need to do some research on where it drops, and if you're not at hit cap when you enter a raid (with precision you'll need 14% against raid bosses), use food and elixirs to compensate. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/13770856991-where-is-all-the-hit-gear.html))<br />
<br />
&quot;Bring the Player Not the Class&quot; and PVP<br />
We would love to get that mantra to be more meaningful in PvP. It's just a lot harder. That is still the goal, but no, I do not think we are there yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13723442570-bring-the-player-not-the-class-and-pvp.html))<br />
<br />
PvP and burst damage<br />
I do not have a great deal of information for you at this point, but I can say we do share the concern specifically regarding burst damage in PvP. There is much discussion amongst the developers about PvP game play at this point. We're going to see how people fare once battles are more saturated with resilience, however, we are well aware this may not fully address the issue. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/13771097393-pvp-damage-is-borked.html))<br />
<br />
Off-hand slot disparity<br />
Paladins, druids and death knights are designed around the fact that they don't have the stat allocation on a gun (or a shield in some cases) available.<br />
<br />
We typically design Idols et al. without say Strength or Stam on them because we don't want them to just be guns with different art that you can't shoot.<br />
<br />
If in the overall picture a class or spec is gimped compared to others who fill their same role, then that is a problem. But you can't just lift any single piece out of the whole package and scrutinize it. In those cases we almost certainly have implemented a difference on purpose. It is one of the things you have to do to justify having multiple classes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/13723443027-reason-behind-the-disparity.html))<br />
<br />

Frost Presence armor bonus<br />
Yes, the nerf to druid affects Frost Presence. When we buffed Frost Presence, we increased it above and beyond what was needed to offset IBF and Bone Shield in order to compensate for this change.<br />
<br />
Specifically, items with bonus armor (rings, trinkets, necklaces and sometimes capes) do not have their armor multiplied by Frost Presence. Most of your armor comes from good old plate, which never has bonus armor, and thus is always multiplied by the full amount. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/13593871518-ibf-massive-incoming-nerf-why.html))<br />
<br />

Feral gear changes in 3.0.8<br />
<br />
Feral druids were the poster child for normalization. You were dependent on relatively few drops -- if you were lucky, there were 1 or 2 feral staves per raid tier. Get those and you are happy. Fail to get them and you risk losing your spot. In many cases it isn't even an issue of optimization. Ferals couldn't pick up a tanking sword or rogue dagger as a reasonable backup if the staff didn't drop. You are really dependent on a random number generator to be good at what you do.<br />
<br />
So what are the options to introduce more of those items?<br />
<br />
Simply inflating the loot tables doesn't fix anything. Either we just drop more Feral loot than normal (which ends up frustrating everyone else and makes druids easy to gear up) or we just drop more loot for everyone on every boss (which makes everyone too easy to gear up). Having a dozen armor rings and staves per tier really doesn't do anything to the problem.<br />
<br />
Requiring ferals to persue badge or PvP loot (to the exclusion of random drops) also feels lame. You finally kill Kael or Illidan and get... more badges.<br />
<br />
These were not strictly feral issues. Several specs and classes had similar problems, especially as we designed gear that was more and more optimized for the particular stats that most benefit you.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, we thought the best solution was to be able to have more players benefit from the same loot. The easy way out would have been to make e.g. all tanks care about the same gear, but at some point we think that leads to the only difference between playing a druid and a warrior what art you see. Now when you roll a druid you care about different gear than other tanks do, but it is still gear that is readily available without having to put it all on rep or badge vendors.<br />
<br />
We're not completely done with how feral gear works. (As a minor example, we did just allow druids to use polearms.) We have some other ideas to make collecting pieces more interesting than just whatever the melee leather for your current tier happens to be. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/13593871579-druid-armor-on-ptr-a-big-positive.html))<br />
<br />
Nourish<br />
One of the cool things about Resto is there are so many different options to use depending on the situation. The downside is it risks making the niche for some abilities too small.<br />
<br />
We think there is some validity to the notion that Nourish is not propped up enough by talents. It will also be getting a glyph at some point. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13392161615-how-to-make-nourish-less-useless.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking idols<br />
I think I said recently that we recognized that we needed to add a few more idol options for bear tanking. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/13723783310-gc-re--relicsidolssigils.html))<br />

Windfury<br />
A player asked at Blizzcon if we would consider removing the internal cooldown on Windfury. We honored that request and did consider it, but we concluded Enhancement dps would shoot throught the roof. So I'm sorry, but we aren't going to make that change at this time. We might consider it in the future as part of a series of changes that would nerf Enhancement dps in other ways to justify the WF change. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13594171481-gc-confirmdeny-wf-changes.html))<br />
<br />
Elemental changes<br />
Shamanism wasn't intended to increase Elemental's damage as much as it was damage scaling. You probably won't notice a big difference unless you are in a lot of Naxx 25 level gear.<br />
<br />
Elemental Oath, Elemental Mastery and the Lightning Bolt glyph were intended to increase Elemental dps however. Don't discount the clearcasting portion of Elemental Oath.<br />
<br />
We're looking at Flame Shock. Keep in mind that even if it doesn't compete with Lightning spam against static targets like Patch (and we're not even convinced that is the case), there are very few fights like Patch and anytime you need to shoot and scoot, Flame Shock looks like a pretty nice button. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13723783238-back-in-pve-worldelemental-recap.html))<br />
<br />
Upcoming Elemental changes<br />
Unrelenting Storm and Storm Earth and Fire will both become three point talents, so that should free up a few talent points for you. The new talent will improve damage on lightning bolt and lava burst, so it's one you'll want to take as an elemental shaman. You should be able to grab that talent and still place 14-pnts in enhancement. I'm curious where else in elemental you're spending your talents.

Upcoming warlock changes<br />
Look, I know you’re impatient. I would be too. It’s totally understandable. We do have changes in store for warlocks. Changing shards is one of them, of which the new summoning mechanic is but a very early first step. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13723442614-the-ghostcrawler-challenge.html))<br />

My Prediction is...<br />
<br />
Elemental Mastery now gives your Fire, Frost, and Nature damage spells a 20% increased critical strike chance and reduces their mana cost by 20%. Lasts 30 sec. (Old - Only affected your next spell, increased critical strike chance by 100% and reduced mana by 100%)....<br />

I would believe it's maybe to help SPs in PvP, because they already suck with the snare in PvP already. But I do agree, 1% penalty kinda doesn't make sense for a glyph, they can just increase the range of MF base and make a different glyph of MF like a DPS one or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
--------<br />
I didn't see this mentioned (apologies if so), but new in todays update, many upper tier Enchants have had their mat requirements changed and/or lowered. And by lowered, I mean the focus isn't on 20 Greater Cosmics per enchant - it's more like 4 Greater Cosmics with a shard requirement.<br />
<br />
An example -<br />
Mighty Spellpower live - 40 Infinite Dust, 20 Greater Cosmics, 6 Abyss Crystals<br />
Mighty Spellpower ptr - 16 Infinite Dust, 4 (!) Greater Cosmics, 4 Dream Shards, 6 Abyss Crystals<br />
<br />
For those DE'rs out there like myself, this is an awesome change. I'm loaded to the brim with shards, but Cosmics are always in use. Nice to see they're smoothing out the mat curve. Those last points aren't looking so painful anymore.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
Also, Arcane Powder stacks to 100 now (up from 20). The new tables use 5dust per, and I typically carried 1 stack of powder, so this is a welcome change that lets me stock up less frequently. <br />
<br />
Sadly, teleport/portal runes are still pegged at 20 a stack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Simply allowing druids to pick up 2H maces, staves or polearms is great for their itemisation.<br />
As warriors will generally avoid maces anyway, and only hunters may be facing a little competition. It's a good change which should hopefully lead to less gear being disenchanted.<br />
<br />

The lack of rogue updates however, is, as usual quite disheartening.<br />

Anyone raiding 4-5 days a week probably won't have a huge lot of trouble with it either, but plenty of frustration as the staff they wanted &quot;again&quot; didn't drop.<br />
This gives more options, even while leveling.<br />
<br />
And yeh, there's going to be a few unhappy hunters wanting http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40497 as well. It's not like a raid has 3-4 feral druids though.</div></div><hr />

DK tank weapons is nice, though of course now the QQ about there being no upgrades for the starter tanking 2 handers will begin ... (I am sure they will be made BoE too).<br />

* Master Conjuror now Increases the combat ratings gained from your conjured Firestone and Spellstone by 15/30%.<br />
<br />
Isn't it the current state of things?<br />
<br />
<br />
A Fel Firestone gives 1% increased spell damage and 42 spell crit.<br />
<br />
The old wording of 30% increased effect suggested that the Fel Firestone with the talents would give 1.3% increased spell damage and 54.6 crit rating. The new wording suggests that you get 1% spell damage and 54.6 crit rating with the talents.<br />
<br />
So this could either be just a wording change if the 1% spell damage never scaled or it could be a nerf if the 1% spell damage did scale. Since a 0.3% damage nerf seems pretty pointless I am guessing it is just a wording change though 2 talent points for 12.6 crit rating is really, unbelievably, ridiculously bad.</div></div><hr />

boo for Death Strike glyph changes. Whole point of Death Strike is the heal, if it doesn't increase the heal, it's pointless (compared to SS and OB)<br />

<br />
well Death Strikes healing scales off the damage it does and the more dmg it is the bigger the heal so technically it still increases the healing but its a bad change and it pissed me off<br />

Really? Because DKs aren't facerolling everyone except Ret Palas amrite? Because there is the only way of CC? IF you call a chance on reliable CC... But even if you think that's the only thing you add, I recommend you to look at your spell book again.<br />

so they change druid staves cause they want to remove niche weapons but add dk tanking two handers?<br />

<br />
It's crafted, not an option and you can get a 2H to tank better in higher level raids... as long as you are defence capped. This is just to help those DKs suffering to get enough Defense and that don't want to go the retarded way (DW).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except technically they aren't DK-only weapons. It's just that DK's are the only tanks that use 2H'ers.<br />
Basically, there were no tank 2H'ers before this patch, because all the other tanks are either bears or use shields.<br />
<br />
It'd be a DK niche weapon if it said stuff like, &quot;Equip: improves disease damage by 1020&quot; or something along those lines.</div></div><hr />

I've been frost since the beginning and noticed the same, but was more excited about the craftable parry weapon that is the same model as the runeblade we can choose at the beginning (favorite weapon model in the game yet!) - but you're absolutely right, HB losing it's cd will give me a little bit more burst in pvp for those normal periods of being kited. Having a decent ranged option is one of my favorite parts of frost for pvp. <br />
<br />
Frost forever for me, but this patch will even things out quite a bit across all three trees, I think.</div></div><hr />

boo for Death Strike glyph changes. Whole point of Death Strike is the heal, if it doesn't increase the heal, it's pointless (compared to SS and OB)<br />
<br />
<br />
It was to my understanding that they were buffing the healing deathstrike gives without the glyph so that glyph of deathstrike wasn't so mandatory in every build.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really, you gotta Death Strike to heal, now you do more damage when you use it. The whole point is to damage and heal.</div></div><hr />

Tha'ts most likely at typo at the moment. I'd be very surprised if they aren't BoE when they go live. Otherwise, what's the point? Blizz wanted it to get easier for all DKs to reach the def cap and not only Blacksmithing DKs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't be certain that the healing is indeed buffed which should be the case normally.<br />
But I know how twisted Blizzard can be: it's possible that they buff the dmg of 20% but lock the healing value to it's initial value, I don't understand what clearly Blizzard is doing.<br />
If the dmg is buffed of 20% before calculating the healing done, which should be the right thing,<br />
it would mean that the glyph before (as on Live) was buffing the dmg (so buffing the heal), and then buffing the heal again a second time. I would understand such nerf which I never thought worked like that, but it really impact you severly when you are trying to realize stuff, lets take for example solo Onyxia, Molten core and stuff... you take a double nerf in the face kinda hurt... So I would understand this nerf, but it frustrate me, and I dont play this game to be frustrated, nor pay Blizzard each month to frustrate me nor you, for that matter.<br />
So what ? I was able to solo this boss and that boss, and now I won't be able to do it anymore ? Onyxia well it's so easy that I guess it will be still doable. But for harder stuff hmm. Can't tell you which one I'm talking because I wanna keep exclusivity on my videos.<br />
But lets take for example, something decently difficult, kill AQ20 Ossirian with the buff 300% up. It's kinda hard with my current set up, if I take this double nerf in the face...I wont be able to do it anymore...Or with a hell of difficulties, depending of how the others change of Vampiric and stuff can work out.<br />
<br />
<br />
But I hate Blizzard for it, what a lovely christmas present, Can't you just beta test your stuff decently before giving us false hope when we roll a new class? Death strike was my fucking favorite abilitie, and it has been nerfed to the ground, I don't hear many complaints of DKs, because the nerfs we had they tried to make it look like a buff. But now I'm sure of it, my character (tank blood spec), next patch up, is hugely nerfed, end of story.<br />
&quot;Hey blood dks we want to buff you, because you sucks&quot;, my ass, they nerf us even more...<br />
<br />
<br />
All I feel is that you are gonna heal shit with this... you are gonna be lucky to crit heal at 6-7k...If I smell the coffee as I think it's gonna be.<br />
<br />
And hey, guess what ? the 3 glyph I'm using are Anti magic shell, Death strike, Rune strike... All of which are nerfed...( I dont care that the cooldown of AMS go down from 1min to 45sec, the nerf that nobody saw is the glyph 5sec down to 2sec and still the 15sec penality even if the cooldown has been lowered, which if they got a brain, mathematically the penality of 15sec would be 15*45/60=11, so don't tell me Anti magic shell has been buffed it clearly has not in my set up... they wanted to nerf it hard, but making us think they didnt so they throw us bones here and there. Yeah bones, that kinda fit DKs background...)<br />
<br />
DO NOT think Blizzard is on your side they are not. They want to nerf DK, they are not finished yet&gt;. It's the first push, of a long long serie. Until you suscribed many more month, to relevel to 80 your main, and stuff it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the nerfs (to glyphs for christ sake, not even talents) affect your ability to solo onyxia, mc, etc... Omg that should be addressed! <br />

Hah!<br />
<br />
You are not able to solo AQ20 Ossirian anymore.<br />
Onyxia will now have a field day versus Death Knights.<br />
Molten Giants will now /point /laugh when engaged by a Death Knight.<br />
QQ moar!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
DK's faceroll pvp more or less, so there is no reason for blizzard to not balance it slightly more. If you wanna QQ about nerfs, talk to paladins after patch 3.0.0 went live and the truckload of nerfs that followed it. This doesn't even come close to it. Besides, it's on the PTR now, it's not even live.<br />
<br />
Seriously, just quit your subscription if you think it's all a conspiracy to nerf DK's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are a fooling yourself if you think gkyphs aren't like talents...they are even way above...each glyph are like a 5 points talent bonus in your talent tree...<br />
<br />
And what the hell is doing christ in here ?<br />
<br />
You laughed, and I laughed back even harder...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">T3KN1K</div><div class="date">2008-12-23, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really? Because DKs aren't facerolling everyone except Ret Palas amrite? Because there is the only way of CC? IF you call a chance on reliable CC... But even if you think that's the only thing you add, I recommend you to look at your spell book again.<br />
<br />
<br />
First off you need to work on your English because half your shit is horribly written. <br />
<br />
Secondly 20% chance every second is a pretty reliable CC for pealing (I don't consider it reliable like a mages sheep and it shouldn't be) but for pealing someone off your teammate with a 10% proc per sec isnt really attractive anymore so the Glyph is useless considering it was very situaltional in the first place... <br />
<br />
And wtf is this &quot;Look at your spellbook&quot;????? ..... are you fuking kidding .....are you tryin to be a smartass and say that Strangulate (Silence) is a CC that Chains of Ice(Snare) is a CC or Deathgrip(Distance closer)... do everyone a favour and stfu please because you're so clueless it's annoying .... <br />
<br />
The reason ret palis and dks are facerolling is mainly due to PvE gear. When it comes to dks their boneshield and IBF is too strong ATM because it allows them to not worry about wearing resiliance and same with ret palis their bubble is momentarely making them also not have to worry about resiliance.... and if you look at the coming patch there is going to be a 50% dmg reduction while in Bubble and Bone Shield is comin down to 20% and so is IFB which is going to help with this situation NOT SOLVE IT.<br />
<br />
And another thing.... its the first season at 80 everone is new to it, people are not PVP geared and noone has enough experience yet either OK... tell me one thing Mr. Genious how balanced was S1 at 70 at the start.... huh tell me ....it WASN'T exactly!!!!! and u can't deny that. With that said, it was only getting slightly better as the seasons went by but something always got fucked up and a comp or a class was OP because that how MMO games are (considering there are both elements of the MMO equaly implamented PvE and PvP like it is in WoW where as Warhammer concentrates more on PvP and it is more PvP balanced)..... so my advice to you is just chill tha fuck out and let the nerfs buffs happen to all the classes. This is something Blizz can't do and never was able to do instantly nor will they ever achieve this unless they make a PVP WoW version and a PvE WoW version (if you want instant balance go play CS: Source and other FPS games) ....<br />
<br />
Lastly you can flame me some more and post some other dumb shit that I wont read becaue I'm not revisiting this thread again.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evilnapkin</div><div class="date">2008-12-23, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did this patch come out today ? (at work)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fatalle</div><div class="date">2008-12-23, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then you have way too powerful glyphs - believe it or not most classes have lackluster, if not awful glyphs.<br />
Cry more, it feeds my sidelined-indefinitely warlock, cry enough and she may yet waken from her slumber.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I ahve a lvl 76 destro-warlock, 71 resto-shaman and 70 DK. Of the three the warlock has the worst glyphs. Although to say 1 glyph = 5 talent points is WAY too generous I would have to say the glyphs on my shaman and DK are very benefitial and affect his game play considerable and the glyphs for the lock are simply lame. <br />
<br />
Warlock:<br />
Glyph of Corruption - the only glyph that really has a great pay out. It is equal to 2 points into Nightfall on tier 4 of the affliction tree. Since destro relies on corruption or CoA to proc Molten Core I have to say this glyph rocks.<br />
Glyph of Imp - 10% improved imp damage. I use my imp all the time so this helps but it is rather weak for a major Glyph selection.<br />
Havent received my 3rd glyph slot yet but the options left are very bleak for a destro lock.<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
Glyph of Chain Heal - Awesome of AoE healing<br />
Glyph of Water Mastery - Nice MP5 bonus<br />
Glyph of Lesser Healing Wave - Nice Healing Bonus<br />
<br />
DK:<br />
Glyph of Obliterate<br />
Glyph of Icy Touch<br />
Glyph of Rune Strike<br />
<br />
Anyway thats my 2 cents. My lock is my main ATM but I'm not very happy with the runes she has available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The point of them no longer being BOP was to make it fair to all, so it is balanced. They didn't want people rolling smithing just for the sake of a weapon. That's why all professions have their profession specific benefits now, which are boons that no one else can use.<br />
<br />
LW - Bracer enhancement / cheap leg enchants<br />
Tailor - Cloak enhancement / cheap leg enchants<br />
Smithing - Socket Gloves and Socket Bracers<br />
Engineering - Belt, Cloak, and Glove enhancements<br />
<br />
I may be missing something, but that's the short version.<br />
<br />
I did think it was wrong that all warriors (and later retadins) were rolling smithing just for this welfare weapon, considering how easy it was to get... and the new version is STILL easy to get... in fact... far far far easier.</div></div><hr />
