Strings<br />
The description of the arena season confirms slightly that the patch is to be expected on June 21st. <br />
Arena<br />
<br />
ARENA_MASTER_NO_SEASON_TEXT = &quot;Arena battles and Rated Battlegrounds are only available during an active player versus player combat season. Season 10 will begin one week after the end of Season 9, so be prepared at that time to take your shot at glory!&quot;; <br />
<br />
<br />
Trial Accounts<br />
<br />
TRIAL_CAPPED = &quot;Trial cap reached.&quot;;<br />
TRIAL_LEVEL_CAPPED = &quot;Trial level cap reached.&quot;;<br />
TRIAL_RESTRICTED = &quot;You need to convert your account to access this feature.&quot;; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

They just can't find the sweet spot. I've had an alt feral since TBC (rolled it for the easy mode PvP tank gear originally) and it's always been one extreme or the other. One day I feel like I can't kill cloth and go down 1v1 to every class. Next patch I run around 2 shotting geared trees with Barkskin up (this actually happened twice, both times in WG)</div></div><hr />

Say your Death Knight has 5500 strength, roughly what you can expect end game. Jumping from 5% more STR to 20% is a big friggin' sweet spot. You would jump from 10,450 attack power to 12,540. That's a 2090 AP rise ... not really a little tweak is it?<br />
<br />
This has always been their problem. They buff and nerf things by such a huge amount, they never reach a &quot;sweet spot&quot;. I can understand if they changes damage by 2-3% to make up for the damage, but not throwing random numbers onto the PTR and seeing how it goes. Now what's happened is that Frost was nerfed too hard and is underpowered, and unholy was buffed too much. So now everyone is speccing Unholy again. If they used smaller increments, these two specs would be pretty damn close. If they had nerfed frost by only 5% and buffed unholy, they would be pretty damn close.<br />
<br />
PTR is for me a waste of time, as nothing ever gets balanced there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh....and they wont nerf it 2 weeks later cause if they would UH will be back to where is now,aka a dead specc for both pvp and pve! <br />
<br />
some might consider 20% is to much but is a must considering they nerfed our survivability by a lot,aka selfhealing(read gylph of dark succor)!Before this UH, for pvp, was intended to be a specc with sustained damage ,decent survivability and some control (ofc if you know to micromanage your pet) till you get the opportunity to score the kill,but when survivability went down by a lot damage must go high to compensate!<br />
<br />

PTRs only are there only to lower the life time of the new content of the patch.<br />

PTRs are here so world first nolifers can become VIPs ( no envy srsly,I wouldn't take that popularity even if it was handed to me for free) :D<br />
<br />
Frost will definately be damage buffed soon after the ptr hits live! Problem with frost was that it recived the damage buff before they nerfed selfhealing,but tbh I'm still worried about its future pvp viability since,of all 3 specs,was the 1 with the lowest survivability and now will be trained down with no effort!!</div></div><hr />

I guess for end game it's balanced with the set change but what about the rest of the game?<br />
<br />
Will green/blue/leveling moonkins dominate and then QQ at rest of the party for doing 'poor' dps?<br />
<br />
<br />
What this means for a T11 Geared Boomkin (with the 4-piece setbonus)?<br />
<br />
Nothing really. According to Blizzard it should result in roughly the same DPS as before the change.<br />
<br />
What this means for Druids without the set bonus?<br />
<br />
It will result in slight increase in DPS, but hey Balance Druid DPS hasn't really been that awesome of late so it doesn't automatically mean we'll top the DPS meters.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Yeah, most likely we will see some &quot;domination&quot; (if that's what you want to call it), but it's so minor that it doesn't really make any difference what-so-ever. The thing to remember here is that 23% on top of that 1k DPS (in lower lvls) is not all that much.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
So to answer shortly:<br />
<br />
Will green/blue/leveling moonkins dominate and then QQ at rest of the party for doing 'poor' dps? <br />
<br />
Not really. Slight increase, but nothing big.<br />
<br />
I guess for end game it's balanced with the set change but what about the rest of the game?<br />
<br />
It is definitely a buff to druids all around and especially those without the T11 4-piece setbonus.<br />

Now I can move onto 6 button spam as unholy as my offspec (MS Tank). TBH we all knew unholy was going to get a buff due to the amount of people not playing the spec and re rolling to the face-roll frost DW/2H spec. <br />
<br />
Just hope this is enough to allow unholy to compete in pve without showing frost up to much for those who like to afk and die in fire.<br />
<br />
My holy pala will be happy as well hopefully it will be like the old DISC priests put in reverse Heal/shield instead of shield/renew everyone. Nice! but i don't get why disc priests dont get a change like this its beyond me.</div></div><hr />

There's slight dialect differences. Just just there's slight differences between US and UK English. Most likely its just that they finally decided to spell Armour, Valour and Honour correctly...</div></div><hr />

If you didnt notice already tier 11 was massively nerfed and this is to compensate. LOL so many boomkins though omg we are getting so buffed then took the time to actually l2read patch notes and woke up. As far as feral ive done several firelands and only seen one feral dps that was at the bottom of the meters just like live so i dont get why people are saying cats are going crazy.<br />

You must have missed the significant nerf to Balance that warranted the compensation. (hint: Look farther down, specifically at the 4pc set bonus)</div></div><hr />

By significant you mean rather minor right?<br />
Instead of guaranteeing 2.5 crits, you're likely guaranteed 1.25ish?<br />
<br />
Sure it's a nerf, but it's insanely out weighted by the buff.</div></div><hr />

How so? There are other MMO's that have international servers and as it is, there's a LOT of Australians/New Zealanders playing on US servers where time zones are drastically different than their own. If people are willing to pay for it, I fail to see the problem.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ungar</div><div class="date">2011-06-15, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Say your Death Knight has 5500 strength, roughly what you can expect end game. Jumping from 5% more STR to 20% is a big friggin' sweet spot. You would jump from 10,450 attack power to 12,540. That's a 2090 AP rise ... not really a little tweak is it?<br />
<br />
This has always been their problem. They buff and nerf things by such a huge amount, they never reach a &quot;sweet spot&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
It seems like they don't want a balanced sweet spot. They give big nerfs and buff like 5% to 15% and it really changes the class potency. then people start playing that &quot;flavor of the month class&quot; after its buffed until it gets nerfed, and they buff another class. thats not to say each class gets it fair share of buffs in the long run, but that there are always big changes. they probably think this keeps people interested more than buffing 1% and keeping that class the same for 12 months. I had more to say but people are only typing 5 words in this thread, this is probably TL;DR anyway</div></div><hr />

I won't really complain because I like frost as much as unholy, but my frost spec does only a little bit more than my unholy does after the nerfs to frost. This buff will just turn unholy's scaling up to 11.<br />
<br />
I still think frost will have better control and burst with their damage, but the snowballing from unholy will just be insane.<br />

Still happy they did something for unholy.</div></div><hr />

Ok, turns out that I can't seem to locate the blue post that was supposed to basically back up what I said. I do know that there was a blue post out there stating the reasons why US &lt;--&gt; EU isn't offered, though. :|</div></div><hr />
