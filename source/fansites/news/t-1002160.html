We’d like to thank everyone who’s provided feedback or questions on the Guardian Cub announcement (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3665632/Sneak_Peek_Guardian_Cub_Tradable_Pet-10_10_2011#blog) and how allowing it to be traded relates to our stance against gold selling. Our hope today is to discuss our desire for a more secure and enjoyable game environment, and provide some clarity on how the Guardian Cub fits into that goal in its own small way.<br />
<br />
To begin with, we need to reiterate what we know are the facts of third-party gold sales, and how they impact World of Warcraft players. We've been hard at work for years now thwarting gold farming tactics, and we know that only a very small percentage of gold is actually &quot;farmed&quot; these days. The vast majority of gold that third parties sell to players is obtained through account compromises. Your friend, guild mate, or family member who had their account hacked was specifically targeted for their gold so that it could be turned around and sold to another player looking to buy some.Having your account compromised is one of the most negative experiences a player can have, and dealing with hacked accounts makes up a significant portion of customer-support time on a day-to-day basis. These issues have serious and far-reaching consequences on our ability to continue delivering epic game experiences and high-quality support for our players.<br />
<br />
We’ve gone to great lengths to educate, inform, and provide increased account security for players through devices like the mobile and physical Battle.net Authenticator. We provide fun incentives for people to use those devices, and we continue to increase our efforts to educate players, block countless phishing and scamming attempts, improve our detection methods to stop account compromises before they begin, and take a harsher stance on third-party gold buying itself.<br />
<br />
With all that in mind, we come to the new tradable Guardian Cub pet. By letting players trade this pet, we’re giving those who want to participate in the Pet Store without spending real money a way to buy the pet with gold instead. This also means that players can buy one for the purpose of trying to sell it in-game, creating the potential for players to exchange real money for gold in a way that does not lead to account compromises. Of course, all that comes with the pretty important caveat that demand for the pet will be finite, and there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to find a buyer.<br />
<br />
While this one little pet can never come close to “solving” the above issues with third-party gold selling and account compromises, it may help us determine whether we’re able address these ongoing problems in a safe, creative way that ultimately has a positive impact on the game experience overall. Our hope is that through all of our increased efforts we can make World of Warcraft a safer, more secure, and more enjoyable game for all of our players.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melodi</div><div class="date">2011-10-20, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still think there should an option within the store that allows you to either buy the pet for the intention of selling it on the AH/trading/whatever (so it's only 1 use for 1 character) and another option for those of us that want it for all of our characters and don't want to spend $100 dollars to get it across our entire account. I'd be willing to pay a bit more for the option that allows us to get pets/mounts from the store that was available to our entire like how things were before.<br />
<br />
Yay for them announcing gold selling officially I guess? I mean really, if you want people to be safe ship an authenticator with every digital/hardcopy of the game. Even still, you won't have people who use it. I don't understand why people do stupid things to their account and then complain about it when it was 100% their fault it was compromised in the first place. You'll never have everyone be 100% safe and I really don't think the pet will put a major dent in the amount of accounts that are compromised. Their reasoning for doing this is poorly veiled at best. Might as well just say &quot;We want more money.&quot; Which I'm fine with because they are a business, but come on...be honest and upfront about it at least.</div></div><hr />

Offer a reseller account plan. I sign up for this reseller account plan and pay a reduced and or no monthly fee as long as I actively participate in buying items from you to sell for gold. Honestly to me if they opened this option up it would greatly reduce the issues with illegal gold selling. My only concern with this is that I'm not going to pay a monthly fee if I'm paying money into the Blizzard store.</div></div><hr />

Though it's true that it might help (slightly) with the account compromises, people who buy gold from the gold selling sites are probably too stupid (yes, I said it, anyone who buys gold from the gold selling sites is a bad person and stupid in my eyes) to do anything for the gold in the first place (like hold the pet on ah, undercut competition, spam trade, etc.), so this won't really help the problem...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's impossible for them to beat 3rd party gold sellers, so they are pretty much &quot;selling gold&quot; just to reduce the amount of people that get hacked. I don't think it's the direction Blizzard wanted to take... but the longer WoW lives, the more 3rd party gold selling websites will open and Blizzard can't stop them, so they are just doing whatever they can to make the game/support experience better for more players.<br />
<br />
I'll admit I don't like it either, but I know it will be better for the game is the long run.</div></div><hr />

It does make perfect sense for Blizzard to be doing this. People are obviously still buying gold and there is a huge demand for it throughout the playerbase, whether you like to admit it or not. However, by offering a token gesture like this, some people will be happy to trade in pets and get some gold that way. CCP with Eve-online has handled rmt quite effectively with the supported functionality of character trading and ingame gold used to purchase game time. With a stable market in game, it all works out quite well for people who need a little extra ingame cash and have the rl cash to support it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To quote them; &quot;This also means that players can buy one for the purpose of trying to sell it in-game, creating the potential for players to exchange real money for gold in a way that does not lead to account compromises.&quot; <br />
<br />
To me, that screams, &quot;We're not really against gold selling anymore, as long as you're buying it from us, not someone else. In addition to that, doing this will make it so we don't have to spend as much time on hacked account recovery because you'll be buying from us so your info remains safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't like it one bit. If they're really worried about hacked accounts it's simple; make authenticators mandatory. Bam, problem of hacked accounts solved.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't direct at anyone specifically. You know damn well how the last few threads on this subject went.<br />

We're all allowed to have our opinions, but the way people express them around here reeks of anger, and an attitude of &quot;if you don't agree on this then you're a &lt;insert insult here&gt;&quot;.<br />

Blizzard fighting gold sellers and still having 10.000 gold needed to finish the new legendary quest. Now... Thats intresting. I call bullshit when its bullshit. The pet is made to earn more money for Blizzard - and in no way increasing the safety or security of anyone. infact the most likely result of this compromised accounts buying pets with stolen creditcardinfo to get more gold to sell as on the goldfarming sites. Secondly - There are plenty of 100% safe goldfarming sites atm. Stupid ppl loose their accounts cause they give up their Email and password on a 3rd rated site. Those ppl are just stupid and no1 can safe them. Both Diablo 3 AH and this pet just shows what is to come from Blizzard. They are trying to go the EVE online way. But heres the news for them. CCP laid off 20% of their workforce yesterday. Part of it beeing the huge buying power that ppl have with real money in EVE now after the latest Expansion.

I highly doubt that we will see WoW become F2P anytime soon. WoW still has the dominant position in the MMORPG market with 11 to 12 million active subscribers AND it already has micro transactions. I don't see it becomming F2P, not unless the doomsday prophets get their way and certain upcomming games deal a major blow to WoW.

And there's an important distinction between gold selling and having items purchasable with real currency that can be exchanged in game for gold (or anything else or nothing): it adds no gold to the economy.<br />
I think it's a positive addition and the store will continue to be until they add items that equate to power at endgame.</div></div><hr />

Or they can do us a favor like they've done since Vanilla - and offer the pet via a gold purchase through an NPC vendor and sell it for a very high gold price. If they did this, it would give people a chance for the pet while adding an extra gold sink into the equation. <br />

Why is this so hard for people to grasp? This is their game, why shouldn't they make money on what they own? Besides, the gold that is is exchanged wasn't created out of thin air like dailiy gold, mob gold, ect. This will have very little impact on each realm.</div></div><hr />

There's a difference:<br />
<br />
One is obtained through stealing one's information and taking it without the consent on the victim. You say no, and your gold is still gone anyway, and blizz has to go get your crap back because you done goofed either by accident or pure stupidity.<br />
<br />
This one is a solid transaction: You buy the pet, and you offered it to the player. The player gets to choose whether or not if they want the pet or not. Here, you decide whether or not what you bought for in gold is freakin stupid or worth the gold.</div></div><hr />

Exactly... The best way to stop account compromises and keep players happy, is if blizzard was to make gold purchasable.<br />
All those years spent on trying to prevent gold sales and account compromises has been a waste of our money.<br />
If blizzard made gold available for sale in a method that inconveniences &quot;farmers/hackers&quot; the problem is solved. Maybe have to have certain account perk to do so.</div></div><hr />

Actually I don't agree. If anything this is aimed towards earning more money, by people buying an extra pet to sell in game to some kid/student/unemployed person who might not have a credit card / beeing able to actually pay real money for this pet. In this way these customers will still generate money income for the pets even if someone else is paying for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Scenario ABC !<br />
<br />
<br />
Cub is bought on a compromisied account with stolen creditcard information. It is then sold through AH to another compromised account meaning that Blizzard has no right to remove that pet from the game. The first compromised account sends the gold it recived for the first sell of the cub to a third compromised accout. That account sends the money to safe and BLizzard have again - no right to get involved. <br />
<br />
Multiply this by 100 and realise who is actually making money out of this. The same gold sellers - only now they are using creditcard info of ppl that might have nothing to do with WOW. But thats ok with Blizzard. They couldn't give a dam as long they dont have to spend the work and will recive the money.<br />
<br />
Now... Thats greed. Stealing money out of stolen CCs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except the pet went from being account-bound to only one-per-character, and obviously the pet itself change gives players a way to potentially (assuming the market is good) trade cash for gold instantly.<br />
<br />
Players who want the pet will have only two choices - buy the pet for cash, or buy the pet for gold when that pet was already paid for by someone else's cash. So no money was lost anywhere. The number of people who want to buy the pet is the same regardless. The only thing different is the source of where you buy it, but Blizzard still got your money either way. 10,000 people buy it for themselves on the store - or instead 5,000 of those people buy it from the store, and the other 5,000 people buy it for gold from someone else who bought it from the store. Blizzard made the same $100,000 in the end no matter what.<br />
<br />
And now if you want the pet for multiple characters on your account, Blizzard is gaining money because a single person is paying double/triple/quadruple/etc. depending on how many characters they're buying for. Also, the people who can't buy with cash before are still giving Blizzard money because it means someone else is forking over the cash to buy it so it can be put on the AH. The only time they'll lose money is if a person is so disgusted by the change that they refuse to support the company for this new method that they won't buy it with gold or cash, and that percentage will probably be insignificant.</div></div><hr />

Of course not. They'll just sell it more cheaply than the cash-for-gold conversion that we get from the pet. That entire post was a load of devious fluff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Third party sales aren't acceptable because (at least one reason and a BIG one for me) they are STOLEN from other players. Blizzard arnt selling gold as such with this (that would be injecting more gold into the economy) but they are giving a way for people to GET gold from real money in a way that doesn't affect the economy.<br />

There is a BIG difference to this than blizzard opening a cash shop where people could just buy more gold. That gold would have to be injected into the economy devaluing everything.</div></div><hr />

I don't really think people have issues with this beeing a legit (or not) way of selling gold. I think that people are generally upset that Blizzard is adding various of random things to generate a higher income for the game, in return the playerbase gets very little to nothing in return.

It's non issue cause a week after it comes out you'll be lucky to get 50 gold for this pet.<br />

When People get hacked, they usually are reimbursed newly created gold, and no gold is removed from the game from either the hackers or the buyers. Anyone that has ever bought gold will be able to confirm that they never had gold removed. Buying a pet for dollars and selling it for gold will have no impact on the economy in the form of inflation. 2: Risk and Demand. You're not guaranteed you'll ever get to sell the pet, or at least not for the sum of gold you had in mind. This is not buying gold, it's a chance to obtain gold. 3: However as a result of this, gold WILL be cheaper from the gold sellers. They will have to really compete on prices, especially while considering the fact that their service may grant players a locked account if discovered. This might on the other hand bring about some inflation, but we'll have to wait and see how it plays out. Since they need larger quantity of gold, their collection process will be slower and they might even be discovered at an earlier stage. There will be a shift in the balance, some people will still take that risk and buy gold as it will yield them more gold per spent dollar, but if blizzard keep their service up and put up new pets and mounts for sale and reselling from time to time, there will be alot of people wanting to do this the safe way through them. 4: This is actually a good thing. It will only affect wow in a positive way.</div></div><hr />

I can definitely understand how this can be frowned upon, but it's their game. <br />
Maybe they're just testing out the response or what sort of impact one pet can have. This is really not that surprising when their next release will have in-game items for cash money...<br />

On a side note, unless I misread, are they saying that buying gold from someone who has hacked an account is wrong, yet someone who has farmed it is now almost ok? (As it is a rarity these days)</div></div><hr />

This cub won't sell for a ton of gold after a couple of weeks, and it won't seem that bad when Blizzard sells something a little more valuable, maybe a mount. And we'll get the MMO equivalent of bracket creep as more and more things will be able to be bought with dollars and sold for gold in-game.I can't say I really care about this at all. I fail to see the danger of allowing players to get gold without farming. So what if some players are able to buy better items? They're doing that already.</div></div><hr />

I think that people are generally upset that Blizzard is adding various of random things to generate a higher income for the game, in return the playerbase gets very little to nothing in return. Lack of new content for example and I don't call remade dungeons/raids like Onyxia, Naxx, Zul'Aman and Zul'gurub for new content.<br />
<br />
So the amount of work they spent on this pet was scaling an existing model, and reskinning (the store already existed, so no programming there, just adding another item to a database to purchase). So instead of doing this pet, they could have reskinned ONE whole model! Wow, that's a lot of new content!<br />

<br />
Stupid people buy gold no matter what. The same people that will be buying this pet are the people that go through third party sites. Thats the type of person they are. <br />
Third party sites lead to our accounts being hacked. You give people a way to buy their gold in a legit way, you put gold sellers out of business.<br />
It does not hurt the economy. No money is added, just transfered from person to person. Its no different then someone getting a lucky BoE drop and selling it to someone else.<br />
You can buy very little with gold. In fact, there are a lot of us sitting around with 100k, 200k, 500k, hell some with a few million gold. You can buy a few BoE items, and mounts. Who gives a crap?<br />
It isn't about Bliz giving people a way to sell gold. It's about preventing people from getting hacked. Blizzard can't stop account hacking. It can't be done and isn't their fault. So in the end, while this may not be a great thing, its still a heck of a lot better than the alternative.</div></div><hr />

Not saying this pet is a big investment timewise for blizzard to create.

The fact that demand for the pet will be finite is more the point. Sure when this pet first comes out you can trade 10 bucks for 10k. But give it a month and you'll be lucky to get 1k 6 months later probably not even that. This single reason is why is it not actually gold selling.</div></div><hr />

Yeah people are gonna feel really stupid when they buy that pet and either no one cares enough to buy it in game or it ends up selling for 50 gold cause there's a ton of them on the AH, i don't see anyone paying that much in game gold for that pet a few will of course but not many especially after the first few days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it really? So your reasoning is that if you are hacked and lose, oh say 400,000 gold that you only get your gold back if blizzard recovers that gold from the hacker? Doesnt work that way. If you lose that gold, you get it replaced, and the chances of the gold being recoverable by Blizzard is pretty slim. By the time its said and done, that gold has found its way through hundreds of accounts to hide the money trail. So blizzard has to generate 400k gold to replace your gold...thus introducing more gold artificially into the system. It can end up devaluing the currency and causing realm inflation. <br />
<br />
I dont see why people have their panties in a bunch over this issue. Honestly, you have to have blinders on to not see that eventually, down the road, this game, as most other MMO's have done already, will move to a system that these micro transactions are what drives the profits of the game.</div></div><hr />

Flooding the market place will only crash the price. Honestly once that happens you wont see these go up for trade anytime soon.

XP boosters, gold boosters, no-repair badges, and so on and so forth...a pet certainly won't cause this trend. It's innocuous enough. But the temptation for such profit will be difficult to fight off. They'll probably go the Nexon route, and make costume (Transmog) tierpieces and outfit for rent (30 days) from cash shop.To quote the Joker, &quot;And...here...we...go!&quot;</div></div><hr />

People were already shady-trading the BoP items, so hopefully this makes a tangible dent in the profitability of hacking.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard makes a buck off it, all the better for them. It won't be my money... and I can only hope this gives them an incentive to ditch the subscription fee once and for all.<br />
<br />
If this goes like I imagine, its quite possible the cash shop will easily surpass the subs in terms of revenue... and at that point, it would be stupid of Blizzard to 'keep people out' with the sub fee, if they're a potential ingame buyer for someone else's cash shop item(s).<br />
<br />
<br />
2) I think people are building up the cub to be something it isn't really. The cub would have to sell for at LEAST 5000g in order to be comparative with the prices &quot;professional gold sellers&quot; charge for gold, and I really can't see it selling for that. <br />
<br />
First, its sold by blizzard, not some shady third party that hacks accounts, so isnt exactly the sorts of people I'd trust. This means Blizzard SETS the price, and the third parties have to go under it. I can't even guess what the margin is for &quot;legitimate&quot; vs &quot;illegal&quot; sales, but I'm guessing its more then you think it is.<br />
<br />
Second, 5000g ? really ?<br />
<br />
If I saw them at that price, I'd probably buy up the AH and relist them for double at least.<br />
I don't even LIKE the pet, and I'd still drop 5k in a heartbeat just for the +1 to achievement.<br />
I see card mounts go for 100k+, so 5k+ for a pet is... nothing.</div></div><hr />

That's assuming it will be worth your 10$ to buy it then sell it in game which it probably wont cause you and everyone else is thinking the same thing, the price will plummet on the AH then it wont be worth the time.<br />
The price would have to stay at 7 - 8k gold for it to be on par with actual gold selling forever which is not gonna happen.<br />
<br />
Also this way no ones account gets hacked when you buy it from blizz if somehow you actually make 7k gold for it to be worth the 10 bucks.<br />

Why in the world woud they possibly do that? They have a game with about 11 millions subcribers that have to pay each month! They also have other god damn it big games like Starcraft or Diablo...

Fact 3. If you don't agree with their instance, don't participate in it. What can someone buy with gold anyway? Few BoE pieces and mounts/pets... maybe power skill up a profession. Nothing that have an impact on game play.<br />
<br />
Fact 4. There are people, like me, that accumulated some gold and like to spend it on store items. This is one small step for that. I really hope they expand this to all items in the store.</div></div><hr />

Tbh, its a win/win situation for everyone. Blizzard - Sells 1 pet 10$ Player 1 - Buys Pet for 10$ Player 2 - Buys pet for 10000g Player 1 - Got his gold he wanted but dropped the pizza and cola he was gonna get this saturday. Player 2 - Farmed gold for 3 hours to get the pet he wanted so much, or needed. Blizzard - Recived money for the work they did on making the pet. Alternate way for player 1 and 2 Player 1 - Was gonna buy this game but turned out he skipped it beacuse he didn't like the videos he watched about the game so now hes wondering what he can spend his money on, hmm 3-5 ingame pets for the amount of the spare money he had. Player 2 - Gatherd gold since Vanilla and has gold cap on 2 characters and got most rare pets/mounts ingame and wants to spend more of it. Player 2 - Buys all 5 pets of player 1 for his main and alts for 50.000g, now he has 1.950.000g to go after the process. Player 2 - Finally got his cool/cute looking pet, or the pet he needed for the achievment. Blizzard - Recived money for making the pet. EVERYONE WINNING. Unless someone can tell me HOW anyone lost anything in this proccess? Now stop crying childern who obviously don't have 10$ and more than 100g on their 85 mains with full epic beacuse they got carried and average ilvl of 370 and still only push 10k dps and cry about not being able to farm gold for 280% training. Because thats the ONLY reason you kids are crying. I am not gonna pay irl money for this pet, I might pay gold ingame for it, tho I was kinda saving for the spectral tiger but hey, I am fully on side with blizzard. As long as this is a win/win situation I don't get why you guys complain, go do something interesting with your time, like farming gold or getting a job maybe? Maybe you wouldn't have to whine about others getting what they want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's no more gold selling than TCG loot is gold selling.<br />
<br />
They sell BoE items that may or may not have in-game value. They don't introduce new gold into the economy. That's a far cry from having a &quot;gold store&quot;.<br />
<br />
You cannot get rid of illicit markets except by offering a non-illicit alternative. It didn't work for alcohol, it didn't work for prostitution, it still doesn't work for drugs. Where there is demand, there will be supply, no matter what the authorities do.<br />
<br />
Making Pet Store items tradable in-game creates a way to buy gold without:<br />
<br />
a) stealing it from anyone, or<br />
b) introducing more currency into the economy<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no reason to be against this, except on some sort of misguided principle that makes it worse for Blizzard to endorse someone whipping out a credit card to buy BoE epics, than it is for the status quo, where people whip out credit cards to buy BoE epics from criminals who ruin the game experience for thousands upon thousands of WoW players.<br />
<br />
Gold selling will be around regardless, with this system you get rid of thieves and keyloggers.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is NOT selling gold. If they were selling gold, then that gold would ´magically appear´into the economy and cause inflation. This causes no GOLD to magically appear, instead what is magically appearing is a cosmetic pet. The gold in the economy is just being shifted from one player to another 2. Customer service. Blizzard mentioned this.. but in reality, most of us can imagine how much customer support time is ´wasted´trying to recreate the account of someone who has been hacked. 3. There is risk in this - If you buy the pet in hopes of trading cash for gold.. you still have to worry about AH competition. My guess the conversion rate is going to be very low after the first week. Are there that many real pet collectors? Most people only have 1 pet collector that goes for the achievements (and bonus pets). But really it goes back to 1... Blizzards IS NOT creating gold and adding it to the economy. The main reason accounts are hacked is to sell off the items on the account and then sell that gold to other players. Having a legal way to buy gold hopefully will greatly cut down on the profits of the hackers.</div></div><hr />

They'd have to be super lucky and hack atleast 1 super rich account per server. It's either Blizzard having some deal with the goldsellers as in 40% of their profit and then they get the gold generated or risk a lawsuit. Or the goldsellers are literly hacking their gold as in generating it themselfes some way, they can make floating humanoid billboards in cities so i guess they can do that too. A guildie of mine bought gold and instead of the gold he got 64 saronites traded to him back in ICC times, when there was'nt a great supply on the auction house either. I can't imagine there being any way of getting that amount of saronites (or living embers now) in legit ways during their patch. Besides, they can trackdown most goldsellers by their websites.</div></div><hr />

They haven't introduced ANY new gold into the game - they're not selling GOLD. They're selling an in-game non-combat pet that you happen to be able to trade for gold if you so choose and IF you can find a buyer.<br />
<br />
They know there will always be a market of players looking to buy gold. This basically gives those players an option to do it in a much safer way and without the risk of getting their own accounts hacked. Blizzard hasn't just thrown up amounts of gold with dollar amounts you can buy. The price of these pets will fluctuate in-game depending on the demand.<br />
<br />
So to all the naysayers - They aren't forcing you to buy the pet, whether with real money or gold. It's not a game-changing item. It's a pet. It's a cute pet, but a pet nonetheless.<br />
<br />
That said, I do think they should be less than $10 since they don't go to every character. I might buy it cause it's incredibly cute, but I haven't decided yet. Depends on how much extra money I have around Christmas.<br />
<br />
Of course, anyone who sees this as the ULTIMATE BETRAYAL by Blizzard will effortlessly fail to see any sense and continue to spout how this will be the death of WoW.<br />
<br />
Meh.</div></div><hr />

Everytime a gold seller sells a sum of gold, he's effectively doubling that sum of gold in the economy. His client gets X gold, and so does his victim when they report the account compromise and have their gold returned. This way gold is merely being redistributed, not increased.<br />
<br />
The most disappointing part for me is the application of the pet to one toon only, rather than account wide. It means I definitely won't be buying this with real world cash. However, I expect the reasoning behind this is simply to keep the Auction House demand for this item higher for longer, extending the period of time they have before they have to implement a new item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It means I can play my hobby in a free way - while minimising gold selling - and since wow is a shard based game, it has the added benefit of being able to move gold between servers with a solid-value item.<br />
<br />
It also gives you something permanently current to put gold into to counter inflation, which is constantly decreasing the value of my horde :(<br />

This isn't gold selling, no gold is created by this - only moved around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
exactly..<br />
<br />
Blizzard is not 'creating' gold... where as hacked accounts can 'create' gold (gold gets shipped off to buyers, some of it is not recovered, but the hacked account gets the full amount back)<br />
<br />
<br />
I like this strategy more then I like direct gold buying. The pets value is only as good as the servers economy and demand... there is no blanket $10 US cash = 20k gold on any server.. and again, it's not 'creating' the gold.</div></div><hr />

They don't generate any new gold. They just move it from one gold-rich person to a gold-poor person. Third-party sellers are the Robin Hoods of WoW... That is if Robin Hood asked for a handling fee...<br />
<br />
Except Robin Hood stole from the rich. If hackers were hacking into Blizzards servers and stealing gold, and then distributing it to us, that would be Robin Hood. Gold sellers are just petty thieves who steal something from one person, and sell it to another without any prejudice about who they hacked. We hear about level 85 guildmasters being hacked, but there are also tons of low level new players being hacked all the time.</div></div><hr />

I can easily see the pet selling for quite a bit more than what gold sellers are posting at. I'd pay 15K for that pet. If for some insane reason it goes for 1K, I'll buy one on every one of my toons, 1K is nothing these days. There is risk trying to sell it on the AH (at least you won't lose your deposit). There is more risk trying to buy gold off of a gold seller.</div></div><hr />

That way, there is a consistent way to buy gold without going to third party sites. People are going to buy gold whether you like it or not, there is no stopping it (I personally think its dumb, but heh, whatever floats your boat). Id MUCH rather have blizzard getting the profits then the theives in the gold selling business. Also this leads to far less account comprimises which in turn leads to saving money on customer service, better GM response times, and in general higher quality support, thus higher quality game. Its a win for EVERYONE except for the gold sellers. Its not like gold can kill the raid boss for you... great you might get a few more BoE epics but thats not much.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I give up, this thread, like half of WoW, is full of idiots who cannot form a coherent thought past &quot;herp derp money greed bad herp derp&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'll ignore your dreadful insult and proceed to your argument, like a rational person.<br />
<br />
They freely admit it now, but this wasn't what was said when they released the info at the start. Their intention then was that it was to offer it to people who don't want to spend real money.<br />
<br />
They're jumping on the &quot;Oh it's to help combat gold sellers&quot; because a lot of people advocated that stance and it's a better excuse to allow it, it's totally flawed, but it's better than their original statement.<br />
<br />
This action from Blizzard is now, by their own admission, exactly the same as the majority of the gold farmers. They have admitted in this statement that gold bought illegally primarily comes from compromised accounts, as such, when you buy it you're not changing the total amount of gold in the game at that point.<br />
<br />
If they truly wanted to combat gold farmers, they'd simply ship free authenticators to each account, the cost of this would be a tiny drop in the ocean to what they earn and would end up saving them money in the long run anyway as it would near on eliminate the time/moeny cost for having to reapir the situation when an account does become compromised, which they also admit in this statement takes up a large amount of their time.<br />
<br />
The only reason they don't, is that with this method, they can pretend they're helping the situation when in fact it will do nothing as the cost to gold reward is dreadful and gain a bucket load of money with very little effort involved.<br />
<br />
Even if they don't want to do this, why not allow for an opt-in coin lock system like in Rift? It costs them no more money than the amount required to get it coded, which isn't much, and it solves almost all the need for an authenticator anyway. Done.<br />
<br />
A rational response, Instead of &quot;hurp durp&quot; &quot;mentally handicapped&quot;, would be appreciated :)</div></div><hr />

Yes, Blizzard went back on something they stood hard against from the beginning, but when have they NOT gone back on a past stance?<br />
<br />
If you dont like it, the solution is simple, DONT buy the freggin put with your money and dont buy it with your gold. Its a really logical and simple solution to your grief. It is Blizzards company to do with what the please... if you disprove THAT greatly, boycott them all together. Oh, but thats right you wont because you like the actual game too much vs the once and a while crap Blizzard pulls. Honestly, this little virtual item and currency thing is not worth the stress and drama people are bringing to it. <br />
<br />
Those of you who DO plan to buy this to sell it, I wish you luck because theres going to be a ton of people doing it I have a feeling - and your 10 bucks will be majorly overspent for your return ingame. I did my research and went to a few third party sites (Trust me I feel SO dirty right now) and on average 10-12 bucks gets you 6-12k gold. I really very seriously doubt anyone will pay that much for a vanity item that eventually will sit in their inventory doing squat when the next &quot;cutest thing they have ever seen&quot; gets introduced to the game.<br />
<br />
Plain and simply - dont like it dont buy it, and in the long run its not worth your hard worked for dime to turn and sell it in the AH.</div></div><hr />

How many people honestly would spend money on the pet, which could drop down to a greatly reduced price within a few weeks to sell on the ah? As people have already said, this wont combat goldsellers 100%, its only a quick fix, however if blizzard would allow their customers the ability to buy gold from their own store, which would be risk free ofcourse, then i imagine that would likely lessen the problem of hacked accounts etc.</div></div><hr />

Making a small gate into turning dollars into gold, and in totally legal way, may be a slight kick in goldsellers butts. And even the slightiest kick like this may later turn into their final collapse. <br />

Is going to hurt the economy like actual gold selling does? No. When gold is sold by an exploitative party, that gold comes from compromised accounts. Thus, duplicate gold is created in the economy. When it happens like this, gold goes from one player to another, not creating duplicate gold. This is not your &quot;traditional&quot; gold sale. This is not harmful to the economy. Nothing to see here, move along.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How many people honestly would spend money on the pet, which could drop down to a greatly reduced price within a few weeks to sell on the ah? As people have already said, this wont combat goldsellers 100%, its only a quick fix, however if blizzard would allow their customers the ability to buy gold from their own store, which would be risk free ofcourse, then i imagine that would likely lessen the problem of hacked accounts etc.<br />

Actually, what you and many perhaps are not understanding is that this just another piece of cheese in a different part of the maze with a few walls of the maze moved around. This is seemingly a test marketing with goals to expand if the consumer finds it favorable.</div></div><hr />

Wrong.<br />
<br />
Compromized accounts is one way.<br />
Another in the past has been those massive level 1 creatings that then spell out the names of sites with their bodies arranged on the ground.<br />
<br />
And the big one: word of mouth. Ingame advertising isn't the main way those sites generally advertise successfully to begin with. Its some lug who heard from a friend and did it then tells some other friend etc etc.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jiggles</div><div class="date">2011-10-21, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard's argument still seemed rather disingenuous. They said: &quot;By letting players trade this pet, we’re giving those who want to participate in the Pet Store without spending real money a way to buy the pet with gold instead.&quot; OK, but Blizzard could have easily avoided the gold selling issue by putting the pet on an in-game vendor (at some high gold amount), or as a reward for a lengthy achievement. More stuff for players to do keeps them playing longer, so its not like Blizzard wouldn't benefit from those choosing to earn it that way. <br />
<br />
To deflect from this issue, Blizzard came up with the additional justification that &quot;gold buying&quot; from Blizzard isn't bad because it might reduce the number of &quot;unauthorized&quot; gold sellers, which would reduce the number of hackers stealing WoW accounts. Whether or not this would reduce the number of hacked WoW accounts (I seriously doubt it), this doesn't change the fact that buying a significant in-game advantage with &quot;real&quot; wealth isn't good for a game. At the moment, you have to be willing to give your real money to a shady seller, who might rip you off. It's against the EULA, so even if you get the gold, there's a chance Blizzard will punish you. Or, you buy a rather expensive TCG item (and you still might get ripped off). With Blizzard's new pet, Blizzard themselves put their stamp of approval on gold buying. It's direct and easy, thus more people will do it. And yes, I know &quot;gold buying&quot; in WoW doesn't add new gold into the WoW economy. But so what? Neither does &quot;gold buying&quot; from account hackers. <br />
<br />
Granted, I doubt there will be enough continued demand for this pet alone to sustain a gold buying system for the majority. How serious Blizzard is about gold buying has yet to be seen; in other words, will Blizzard add a bunch more BoE pets/mounts to the store in the future? How popular would a Sparkle Pony pet be?</div></div><hr />

Antivirus, firewall, spyware removal tools and regulary updated OS, that's the only way to deal with hacking.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ninjakiwi</div><div class="date">2011-10-21, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">…Our hope today is to discuss our desire for a more secure and enjoyable game environment, and provide some clarity on how the Guardian Cub fits into that goal in its own small way. <br />
This seems like a fairly reasonable hope…<br />
…Your friend, guild mate, or family member who had their account hacked was specifically targeted for their gold so that it could be turned around and sold to another player looking to buy some. Having your account compromised is one of the most negative experiences a player can have, and dealing with hacked accounts makes up a significant portion of customer-support time on a day-to-day basis. These issues have serious and far-reaching consequences on our ability to continue delivering epic game experiences and high-quality support for our players. <br />
I bolded the excerpt because to me it seems like a poor word choice on Blizzard’s part. While accounts are hacked for gold, the above makes it seem as if the persons themselves were specifically targeted because they had gold. Maybe I’m just nit-picking. Making the claim that hacking is bad for the player and the developers seems fair.<br />
…<br />
With all that in mind, we come to the new tradable Guardian Cub pet. By letting players trade this pet, we’re giving those who want to participate in the Pet Store without spending real money a way to buy the pet with gold instead. This also means that players can buy one for the purpose of trying to sell it in-game, creating the potential for players to exchange real money for gold in a way that does not lead to account compromises. Of course, all that comes with the pretty important caveat that demand for the pet will be finite, and there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to find a buyer. <br />
:( This entire paragraph puts a frown on my face. I’ll begin my concerns with the second sentence. I play on a high population realm. Every day I see at least one person looking to buy or sell a time card in trade chat. Selling codes in game is frowned upon and you can get scammed yet it still happens. How does this relate to the Blizzard store? Along with the time cards in trade chat there is a fairly common message: “WTS Blizzstore pets |[names]|[price]|[mounts]|[price]|”. Just as the case of people obtaining play time through gold instead of cash we see that players are already offered a chance to obtain Blizzard pets and mounts via gold. As also with the time card method this is frowned upon. The omitting of a word in the sentence “…we’re giving those who want to participate in the Pet Store without spending real money a way to buy the pet with gold instead” makes it seem to me as if there is a lack of insight on Blizzard’s part. Either one of two words could be placed after the word participate—safely or legitimately. The original quote goes on to say that players may sell the pet in game for gold if they want to safely exchange money for gold. This implies that because there are less account compromises, the number of accounts hacked will go down. This may be true; however, the post goes on to state that because the rules of supply and demand are present in an open market then you may not be able to find a buyer. The conclusion I draw from this is that people would rather not risk the auction house in a chance for gold that may not be able to compete with gold selling rates. This does not mean I’m saying the number of hacked accounts will stay the same. I’m saying that the decrease in the number of hacks will never be substantial enough to threaten the larger gold selling market.<br />
While this one little pet can never come close to “solving” the above issues with third-party gold selling and account compromises, it may help us determine whether we’re able address these ongoing problems in a safe, creative way that ultimately has a positive impact on the game experience overall. Our hope is that through all of our increased efforts we can make World of Warcraft a safer, more secure, and more enjoyable game for all of our players.<br />
The first sentence of this last paragraph affirms my previous conclusion. The post claims that it will help them determine whether they can handle their problems in a creative way that has a positive effect on the game. I would not have a problem with this except their first idea of creativity was “Let’s sell an in-game product that can be traded amongst players for real life money”. If that is all the creativity that can be mustered in almost 7 years of World of Warcraft then I feel as if my $15 a month is better spent elsewhere. <br />

Now we want your money for each pet/mount you deside to get for each of your characters&quot;. Covering it up by saying its to help those who dont want to use real money to get their pet is just sad. Someone has to buy the pet for real money so that those who dont want to use real money can buy it with ingame gold. Another giant moneymaking goldsink from blizzard. And for the cover-up story about compromised accounts, how about including the authenticator to the boxed version of the game? That would sure help a lot.

Poor choice of words, but yeah, you're correct.<br />
<br />
Is that such a bad thing? I mean I can understand the D3 complaints since you can trade everything there, but in WoW unlimited gold would only let you bridge a small gap between max level and endgame, anybody who raids or plays PvP will be better geared than that, so why is it such a big deal?<br />
I guess they still generally consider the whole gold buying/selling business a bad thing, but at some point you gotta face reality and account hacking is definitely the greater problem.</div></div><hr />

No, they are saying buy &quot;selling gold&quot; in some minor way, they can limit the ammount of accounts hacked. <br />
Why cant anyone think they actualy do this to make a better game? and why is it a problem if there is a legal way to buy gold? you hardly need gold for anything in this game, and as long as they dont pump more gold into the game, it wont screw over the economy (spelling?) in game.<br />
<br />
Basicly, if you dont want to buy this pet, dont do it. I cant see what bad comes from it, there probaly is a downside, but i think there is even more upsides.<br />

They won't hack accounts. Their pet won't fetch 10,000 Gold (or whatever the rate is now) per Euro, though.I think it's a fantastic move, even if people who have been persuaded by Blizzard's terms that paying for Gold (something that is very easy to earn in-game and gets you virtually no long-term advantage, and no(?) BiS gear) is bad innately, when in reality it's just bad when it has come from hacking or botting or because there is a strong chance you will get ripped off. Things are bad for a reason. There is no innate reason that Gold exchanging for real money is all that bad, unless Gold could buy the best stuff in the game. If it's against the rules you don't do it, but there are reasons it's against the rules. Botters, Hackers and Rippers. None of which are good for the game or the players or Blizzard. This has none of those problems.It's a way for lazy/rich people to get some gold, that won't actually help them compete. It might save them a little time/effort gearing up a fresh 85 to get to be in heroic-dungeon-ready gear faster. (Are there enough BoE's to kit you out for a Raid...? I don't know, but even if there is, it's still not the best gear, so any advantage is short lived... saving a little grind, but not much.) No gold is added to the economy. Too many people do it, or people try to do it too many times, the price will plummet and they'll have wasted their cash even more than the waste it would already be to get the Gold they can't do anything useful with in the first place.Blizzard make some money in exchange for a player (that it's not the player who handed over the cash is completely irrelevant) to get a non-combat pet. No difference here to the existing pets in terms of Blizzards money-making ability on it (except it's a worse deal since it's on one char, not all - but nobody is obliged to take them up on the offer).</div></div><hr />

I think what everyone seems to miss in this is that they are not taking away the competition of the chinese gold sellers. The chinese gold sellers are literally SELLING BLIZZARD'S PRODUCT THAT THEY HAVE NO RIGHTS TOO. The gold people get from chinese gold sellers is not only most likely from comprimised accounts, but also Blizzard's gold. Everything in the game belongs to Blizzard. It is illegal for the 3rd parties to sell gold because its not theirs to sell in the first place, whether its farmed or stolen from other accounts. And by illegal, i mean actually illegal, not just in game. Its perfectly legal for Blizzard to do it. And by providing an item to sell to other players instead of selling outright gold, they are not putting extra gold into the economy. If they started selling &quot;gold packages&quot; on the store, there would be a MASSIVE inflation, and you wouldnt be able to buy anything without buying gold. That would make them a lot of money, but would not be good for the game as a whole, which is obviously why they will never do that.<br />
<br />
Plus, theres no stopping gold selling, might as well provide people a safe way to do it, and save lots of money on customer service for comprimised accounts.</div></div><hr />

Period. If you don't want to buy/sell them (as I do not), then DON'T DO IT! I know, hard concept right? 2) Their thoughts of this slightly helping the gold buying problem is actually pretty legit. 3) They will never offer non-vanity items for real currency. Ever. They know that it would cause a huge backlash against the game, and that is a risk they aren't willing to take. I personally would probably just move on if they ever did. Plenty of other good MMOs coming out soon anyways. 4) Yea... a company is trying to make money. How dare they?!?! :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Then halfway into the post, I realized it was just a pretty wrapping paper to the admission of selling gold. Either way the only difference between Blizzard and gold sellers right now is the company making profit. Gold selling is still going to have business because most players who can't make enough gold probably won't make it with an overpriced non-combat pet that everyone will be trying to sell from day one. Even if Blizzard starts selling actual gold, gold sellers will still have business by undercutting Blizzard's prices, eventually leading to an enormous inflation and devalue of gold. Trying to win the fight by competing with gold sellers is only going to decrease the game's quality.<br />
<br />
Are there better solutions to gold selling ruining their game? Indeed there is. Making an authenticator standard equipment (e.g. by adding one to the next expansion package) would greatly increase WoW's login security. But that's a solution that would cost money to put into works, where this solution is just money down into Blizzard's pocket.</div></div><hr />

How i see it is £50 in real money takes me a few hours to get working but 130k gold would take me months to get. I would rather spend a few extra hours working for real money and trading it for ingame gold so i dont have to farm. This is what i do and have done since loot card mounts have been BOE. This pet is no different to what i have been doing. People are QQ for the sake of it.</div></div><hr />

I kinda see why blizzard want to justify it because if you wish to buy a pet to sell on the auction house you will be helping another player out that either does not have the means to purchase it with real money due to a few reasons , too young/ doesnt have a job/doesnt have a credit card etc etc<br />

Thing is if you dont agree with that you have 3 options;<br />
1)buy the pet for YOURSELF and use it on one of YOUR chars!<br />

Ofc it will be profitable. I cant believe ppl are this naive about blizzard. Every single move they make involves thinking &quot;how much this will generate income?&quot; Blizzard will never implement anythin that would sabotage their income. There isnt a shimpanzee level intelligence ppl desiding on these things, but well educated market professionals who might have computer science degree also. To me these store things are mainly for two reasons: 1. To generate income 2. To test what they can and what they cant do with the Titan.</div></div><hr />

I really don't understand why people can not discuss this and not agree with you. Some people made some really good points and all they get in return is: &quot;We did it because people want it&quot; or &quot;you are just whining about little things&quot;.<br />
<br />
This can potentially be a problem but because some people don't want to spend real money on a little random pet they HAVE TO do it right? Just don't get the pet then if you don't want to spend real money on it. There are no other benefits at all. <br />
The only reason Blizzard does this is to sell more pets not because people asked for it. People ask for tons of things, sometimes for the same thing for years and a lot more people asking. Yet we don't get those things.<br />
<br />
And if they want to do this because people don't want to spend real money on pets then why have pets in your store at all. Just make an ingame store where you can buy them for gold.<br />
<br />

Are you guys stupid? Blizzard is doing this for the people who don't want to spend more money. They are doing you a favor, and are actually LOSING money by doing this. People who would normally have to buy it with real money can now spend their overly inflated amount of in game g on the pet instead.<br />

Yes, that's why they do it. Rofl.<br />

<br />
And once again, it doesn't take a genious to see that this is testing waters for further direct cash to gold - objects they will have, or even pure gold selling in the far future, the very text they wrote implies that. 3rd party gold sellers are bad, we are offering a safe and secure way for some people to buy pets for gold sales, bla bla bla. <br />
<br />
&quot;While this one little pet can never come close to “solving” the above issues with third-party gold selling and account compromises, it may help us determine whether we’re able address these ongoing problems in a safe, creative way that ultimately has a positive impact on the game experience overall.&quot; That bit is all that needs reading into. Gold selling is legal now, as long as it profits Blizzard.<br />
<br />
And gold directly translates into player power through purchasing power in AH for epics, creating unfair competition for those who can not afford it for real cash.</div></div><hr />

That's what i think at least, i would probably buy one to put in AH immediately but i doubt this would be a way to acquire gold long term.<br />

Oh they do inject new money into the game world. first they transfer the gold to anonther account. it's gone from player one to player two. in the evening player one logs in and finds himself hacked and robbed. he opens a ticket, speaks to a gm and cries about his stupidness and that he'll buy an authenticator as soon as possible *pinkyswear*. the gm is very friendly and restores every sold item and also his money. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, the amount of money was doubled: Player b (the hacker) was successful and player a got all his stuff restored.<br />

<br />
Imagine a new player with no gold and all those max level characters with gold cap, having to pay so much gold just to level a profession, having to pay so much gold for anything on the AH for that matter. One new player has tons of real money, he buys pets/mounts and sells them for gold, levels all his professions and buys all the BoE epics and everything else he needs. Another player doesn't have real money to spend on pets/mounts or gold. He would have to farm for months and seeing how many people don't like to farm he is not going to have a good time.<br />
This ofcourse already happened because of goldsellers. Economies are already f-ed up.<br />
<br />
Selling these pets won't help. The only thing that will happen is that a part of the goldselling is going to shift to Blizzard. It doesn't help the game or the players. <br />
There are other ways to get rid of goldsellers except it will cost Blizzard money. &quot;People want it&quot; or &quot;it will reduce comprimised accounts&quot; are just lame excuses. Instead of fixing these &quot;problems&quot; with actually selling pets for gold and putting more resources into reducing gold selling they rather make some money and not care about the game or the players.<br />
<br />
But as long as it doesn't affect you they can do whatever they want.<br />

<br />
Gold-sellers who hack accounts definitely do inject new gold into the game economy. When a hacker steals 5,000g from one player and sells it to another player, that 5,000g stays in the economy while the player who was hacked has their gold &quot;restored&quot;, so now there is a total of 10,000g floating around where there was only 5,000 before the hack.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps not the same as gold selling..but it is the same as buying BOE epics from websites...so its still wrong.. If its ok to buy a pet, its ok to buy a BOE Epic is what they are saying.. Which will ofc be on their store at some point in the future.</div></div><hr />

Its blatant gold selling, whether they admit it or not.<br />
<br />
Not at all. Gold selling would add gold to the economy; would result in a known amount of gold; and would never run the risk of not getting any gold out of the transaction at all.</div></div><hr />

Although this is partially true.. I can make upwards of 80-120,000 gold per day if i was doing it full time (ie, gave up my job).. i could then sell this gold legitimately for £150 or whatever the going rate is..i havent hacked anyone, i havent stolen from anyone, i've just used ingame nohow to make it.. so there is no injection of gold.. Why do people assume gold sellers pillage hacked accounts to make their gold???.. Anyone with half a brain would keep making 100k everyday and sell it to gold sellers, rather than 50k everytime they hacked an account.. Dont believe the stance that the majority of the gold sellers gold is from compromised accounts.. I cant believe it, considering how easy it is to make gold with a little effort.</div></div><hr />

They should just make accounts safer instead of this bullshit. I never bought an authenticator because it's their task to make my account safe and not mine. So they could start with giving away those authenticators for free.<br />
It would reduce goldselling by hacking accounts. Bots are already banned very quickly and you don't see a lot of goldfarming bots anyway. So the only way to sell gold is by buying it from players and then sell it to other players. No injection of gold.<br />
Blizzard would also reduce costs on restoring accounts and talking to players and it will be much better for the game in the long run than 'selling gold' themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that ever did happen, I would probably have to quit because I refuse to farm up twice as much gold just to keep pace with the folks buying gold through Blizzard. With the cubs, however, there is no new gold, and therefore no inflation.</div></div><hr />

You sure?... This is indeed gold selling, you are buying something with real money, and trading it for gold..Where did this &quot;gold selling would add gold to the economy&quot; way of thinking..its not even relevant. <br />
<br />
You pay £10 for BoE epic, you sell it in game for 20,000g..Thats buying gold.. Nothing to do with adding gold to the economy. Its a simple conversion of real money for gold..be it a pet or an ilvl378 axe..</div></div><hr />

Ignoring the poor grammar, &quot;gold selling&quot; is the selling of gold for real world money. This is not that. This is selling a token which some other player may or may not be willing to give you their gold in exchange for. The fact that they still need to go out and get the gold means that supply and demand continue to work as they always have. If anything, there will be a small amount of deflation as a result of the overall value of items on the AH going up while the supply of gold continues to increase at its usual pace.<br />

Just understand that there are people out there who do get economics, and they're telling you that that's not how it works in any (even virtual) economy.<br />

<br />
Others have pointed out that you're wrong because of the fact that the original gold is restored. However, I'd like to point out two other problems: 1) Blizzard selling gold most certainly would inject gold into the economy and that would hurt the economy through inflation 2) gold sellers actually do add gold to the economy when they steal it from an account. The account holder wasn't going to spend every bit of gold they have and then liquidate all of their items and spend that gold too, but that's exactly what the gold seller does by selling it all.</div></div><hr />

This. But unlike PLEX prices, pet prices will drop, because of the finite demand.</div></div><hr />

I will put it as bluntly as possible: GOLD IS POWER You can buy better gear with gold. This is power You can hire other players to do your biddings. This is power You can buy mats and powerlevel proffesions with their bonus stats. This is power You can repair your gear and resupply yourself with consumables to up your peformance. This is power GOLD IS POWER WoW is a competetive game. Everyone start from zero. Everyone polish their skill to be more powerful and beat the competition, be it better rotation execution in PvE or outplaying your enemy in PvP. Along with polishing your skill you get gear which reflects your effort. Worse players attain less gear thus less power, Better players get better gear thus more power. If you dont have skills, then you can farm gold on your own. You either show great skills and get rewarded for it or you labour and work it up because your less skilled. Either way accumulating gold via peformance which is either great skills or labour shows that you put effort into something and that's the most basic prinicple everyone would agree with. so in summary... YOUR EFFORT GIVES YOU GOLD WHICH GIVES YOU POWER Maybe not exact reflection of current wow situation given how many different currencies we have but cut me some slack okay? The above is something everyone would agree with right? Effort is a fair resource everyone has access to. Nothing stops you from putting more effort. No one can diminish your effort if you put it in a right way. No one can stop you growing as you keeping putting effort. This is the most basic fair thing a good competetive game has right? Now here comes the pain... RL money. Not everyone has access to excess money to pour into a game Not everyone thus can buy that pet Not everyone thus can put in on AH and get gold for it Not everyone thus can get POWER by not putting in EFFORT. Not everyone has money to get POWER by not putting in EFFORT.</div></div><hr />
