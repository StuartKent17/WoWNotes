Armory Stats - Blackrock Foundry Progression<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Blackrock Foundry progression of players in each difficulty. Now that achievements are account wide, we can group characters by account and get an idea of what percentage of players (not characters) have defeated a boss on each difficulty at least once, based on progression data.<br />
<br />
The data used today is a sample made up of 2.1 million accounts, with at least one character active after April 1. The sample is slightly biased, as players who are not in a guild are much less likely to appear in our sample. <br />
<br />
The second chart uses the number of players that killed Gruul in each difficulty (except Mythic, which uses Beastlord) as the base of participating players for that difficulty. Each difficulty can be toggled on and off by clicking the name in the legend.<br />
<br />
We looked at Siege of Orgrimmar stats in January 2014 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3689-Armory-Stats-Siege-of-Orgrimmar-Progression-Blue-Tweets-DLC-423) and May 2014 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3984-armory-stats-siege-of-orgrimmar-progression-blue-tweets-dlc-439). You can leave suggestions for future stat posts in the comments!<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Flying<br />
Not posting on your site, and only having one response to a player made thread about it was a bad move<br />
Yeah, it's obviously caused a lot of friction that we hadn't anticipated. Clearly a mistake on our part. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/603689859342061568))<br />
<br />
Q&amp;A<br />
By &quot;legitimate&quot; you mean the ones you are willing to field, probably not the onese most find important.<br />
We will definitely be talking about flight in the Q&amp;A. (CM_Zarhym (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/603687502357143553))<br />
<br />
Will you please confirm that flight IS something that will be addressed in this Q and A? Thanks.<br />
We will definitely be talking about flight in the Q&amp;A. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/603782916183695360))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Are there any considerations to lower passive Parry and Dodge again in 6.2?<br />
Certainly if needed. Will look into it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/602293194127118336))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Indeed Zarhym. Wouldn't want those poor underpaid artist to actually do a good job I guess? Really miss the old Blizzard Quality.<br />
It's not at all realistic to design ALL armor to fit ALL char models just in case. But look for any reason to take issue w/ us. (CM_Zarhym (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/604952754004443137))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Apparently selfie cams were an appropriate use of dev time. Not farahlon though.<br />
So you admit you only count additions to the game YOU care about. This is helpful. (CM_Zarhym (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/604954170538356736))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Developer Communication<br />
What's your view on how silent the WoW devs have been on classes changes since you left?<br />
I'm obviously not privy to their thought process. Do remember there is a difference between individual intent and company policy. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/605135596919480321))<br />
<br />
Yeah Just seems like a lot of &quot;we want feedback&quot; *gets feedback* &quot;lol jk we wont do that&quot;<br />
That is something I have worked on articulating my whole career. We want your feedback but we still design the game. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/603000939524411392))<br />
<br />
Understand and respect your customers/players should be important to devs.<br />
I think it almost always is. Players sometime mistake disagreement for neglect. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/604816216776056832))<br />
<br />
Greg, always wandered if Activision and Cata where the breaking points when the Buddy GC had to stop to chat in the boards.<br />
It became Blizzard policy, but it wasn't from Activision. Not sure what the policy is now of course. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/604339544251465728))<br />
<br />
Reputations<br />
Hey greg what do you think about reputations in wow being as dumbed down as it is now with little to no useful rewards<br />
I'm afraid I'm not familiar enough with the content. Reps were always challenging to strike a balance between fun &amp; mandatory (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/604376426519789568))<br />
As I like to say, it's really hard to make fun and rewarding content feel optional. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/604376491338530816))<br />
<br />
<br />
Computers - Setup of the Month<br />
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/may/ssdgraph.gif) are trending slightly downward again over the past few months, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. <br />
<br />
New GPUs from AMD may be coming in the second half of this year, but no official announcements have been made. <br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 4790K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

He ALWAYS was. Blizzard decided to put a gag in their developers starting Cata. I remember how they could come to the boards in WotLK, and talk as an equal to Theorycrafters. <br />
In MoP, Greg TRIED to push the communication line with the developer watercooler. Didn't work, and since he was the most visible developer, everything was blamed on him.<br />
He is more communicative now, because he is that way, and is not being silenced.</div></div><hr />

You ignored the rest of the sentence and ignored the fact that ~half of the 7 million &quot;subscribers&quot; are in Asia, which we don't track. We track a total of ~3.3 million US and EU accounts, which is likely the vast majority of them.</div></div><hr />

Zarhym is going to pull a Tseric. He's close. You can feel it. He's being openly antagonistic to his customers. He's taking it personally, and lashing out. His boss should be pulling him out of a public position right now and saying &quot;You need time off the front lines, big guy&quot;, and let Lore and Bashiok take over for a while. Simply for PR reasons, they need to keep him away from customers. He's being openly rude. That's not his job. <br />
<br />
As for the issue at hand, i would not have brought up Farahlon, but instead brought up the useless transmog sets from salvage crates that have no transmog ability, that they took time to design for &quot;completeness&quot;. Well, why does that principle apply to other sets? Why do items nobody wants get so much attention, and the ones people do want, like Admiral Taylor's sword, or this helm, require a fight to get? <br />
<br />
They need to learn that if you treat people like children, they'll act like children. I have ZERO sympathy for Zarhym. He helped create the tension that's biting him in the ass right now. I care, as a human to another, that he needs to step away for his mental health, but I'm also laughing at the chaos they created, and how he's accusing everyone of having an agenda.<br />

This expansion is becoming a signature of poor communication and subscriber drops. At this rate, it won't be remembered as &quot;the expansion that brought WoW back&quot; but as &quot;the expansion where WoW lost tons of subs and also decided to kill flying in an interview.&quot; Blizzard needs to be much more forthcoming and stop leaning back on their arrogance, such as &quot;the subs will come back for new content&quot; and &quot;only we know what's best for the game.&quot; Wasting development on the &quot;selfie cam&quot; is a completely valid criticism when your players are starved for content, and the attitude to simply not care for keeping subscribers but just wait until you release the next expansion is the attitude of a defeatist.<br />

People wouldn't be complaining in the first place if they weren't stuck in their garrison whenever there's nothing to raid.<br />
<br />
In years to come, this will be the era that is never discussed in the halls of Blizzard. (Yes, they'll still be around, but WoW might not be). If new hires mention it, the topic will be changed, or people will just groan and walk away. <br />
<br />
Their collective &quot;tone&quot; changed as soon as WoD was announced. Clearly, the voices on the team and within the company that vote for more communication got outvoted or shut down. Seen that happen a million times.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm starting to wonder if Zarhym's pissy attitude and Ion and the other devs belligerent tone are a result of not just the players complaining, but pressure from within. There's a lot of devs in new positions who have to prove themselves, and there may have been a lot of pressure to not take the direction they did, and they're drowning, and are trying to pull a win out at any cost. Seen that a million times, too. Zarhym may be on Team Ion, and is reacting to criticism within and from outside the company. I'd LOVE to be a fly on the wall in the hallways of Blizzard these days, to see the mood and where the factions are, and what's really going down. <br />
<br />
It would explain a lawyer being the mouthpiece of the most disastrous expansion ever. The other lead devs like Kosak and Chilton may have said &quot;hey, you wanted this, bud, it's yours to defend, leave me out of it. Go do interviews, see what happens to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
My only hope is, if that's true, the brain trust (/sarc) that came up with WoD is told to go sit on the bench, and a different team designs the game moving forward.<br />

<br />
Interesting. Chaud, it's true half the subs are Asian? Blizzard hasn't released hard numbers on that in years. Not a HUGE revelation, but very interesting, and good to know to put numbers into perspective. <br />
<br />
Woould it be sad to say that of the 3.3 million subs you track, 1/3 pvp, so they don't track in polls on raiding? What kind of numbers do you have access to there? I'd love to see a participation rate for Pvp, compared to this time last year. Granted, Ashran makes it all screwed up, and the bot issue doesnt help, but I'd love to know what percentage of the base primarily plays pvp, and if it's 1/3, they're definitely not getting 1/3 of the dev budget.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here the removal of flying has been a hot topic for the whole of the expansion, and Lore (of all people) says they didn't anticipate what would happen with how they announced it? Lore, you co-hosted Legendary and had some damn insightful thoughts when you weren't on the inside. Now that you're on the inside, it's like you drank the kool-aid. I get that you have to be somewhat diplomatic, but &quot;we didn't anticipate&quot;? <br />
<br />
And Zarhym. That dude need to step away and take a break. Obviously the Selfie cam &amp; twitter integration doesn't directly compare to a full zone and all it would be, but taking the bait like that is insane. It's just fueling the fire. <br />
<br />
As for the armor/race combo. Screw that, you put something like Transmog into the game, you need to do your best to make sure it all looks good on every combination. That's the whole purpose of the silhouette and static sizes of each race/gender combo.<br />
<br />
Unless, maybe that's what they want. Maybe the CMs hands are tied and there's a real serious breakdown of communication within the company that's far worse than we thought. I'm sure we've all gotten that new boss that just won't listen to anything being said or done. They're new to the position and they know right, and even if you've been there for 10 years you just don't know crap anymore. Maybe that's the point, piss off the customer base so badly that it comes to a head. That's what I'm going to go with. This is all a passive aggressive way to get the customers pissed off enough to enforce other change in the departments.</div></div><hr />

IIRC it is armor they added for NPCs during alpha/beta and players asked for it, so they made it available. They only made an Orc version of the helm, as only NPCs were originally going to have it.</div></div><hr />

Bah. My thoughts still stand. There are tons of armor items that are NPC only. If you make it available to the players, do it right, or not at all. Certainly Zarhyms response is just moronic. Someone needs to take his keyboard away for a little while.</div></div><hr />

For system of the month, I think overall it's an awesome job, but why is a 1080p monitor still on there for the unicorn? Its clearly a system that can put out alot more power than most, and having a 1080p monitor and never dipping below 120FPS is a little crazy.<br />
<br />
I propose a 1440p monitor minimum at that level. I'd be more than happy to provide suggestions.<br />
<br />

You're a customer. One of many. You don't dictate company policy and vision. You choose to pay for the product or you choose not to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Love it or leave it&quot; is quite a silly stance to take and awfully foolish if you sincerely care for the game. Odds are you simply agree with the developers and are defending them.<br />
<br />
The problem that you don't get, and perhaps this is me showing my age, is MMO's require inertia to keep moving. During Cata we had a *huge* drop of subs and friends lists got smaller and smaller by the week. When you have no friends to run with, you either quit or find another guild you'll enjoy. Remember guild rep and how &quot;fun&quot; that was supposed to be? Oh my but I digress. You really should know what you're saying is: I want people who will play or quit the game based on big issues without complaining or discussion. If this is what you what, you will end up in a dead world.<br />
<br />
Yes, we know *and* have seen, them ignore feedback. Repeatedly. They lie and mislead. They fail to communicate. They can't be trusted to be consistent. We've seen this since Cata but more pronounced in WoD.<br />
<br />
MMO's kill themselves and WoW is starting down that path as we see in sub losses. They are making excuses and it's still not too late to turn the ship around and appeal to the majority.<br />
<br />
If it's &quot;hard love&quot; they want to give then that's fine -- so long as you understand -- you're going to lose many friends and guilds from it who simply disagree and won't speak up because people like you shut them down and backup Blizzard.<br />
<br />
So yeah, go ahead, if you want WoW to suffocate.. go on with your bad self. Keep hammering people on them spouting their opinions. Rock on. Just know.. you're bringing it on yourself. Be careful what you wish for... I said this when they said WoD wouldn't have flying until the &quot;first major patch&quot; and hinted and maybe later in the expansion. I warned, and was subsequently mocked, that they would *never* hold such a key feature back like that for so long. And we see where we are now.<br />
<br />
People won't &quot;quit&quot; over flying -- but flying certainly will be what finally breaks the deal for a non-trivial amount of people. It'll be the straw that breaks the camels back which, if you're even remotely passionate -- you should understand that this means LESS PEOPLE TO INTERACT WITH in a MMO. That's not good. You want *more* people playing, not less.<br />
<br />
The others here are being nitpicky and just grasping desperately at the little things to mock people over. &quot;Game offers ZERO&quot; -- and instead of arguing and rebuking the point, you attack the person as well as their decision to use, likely as a hyperbolic answer. That tells you right there you're not here for a sincere discussion. You just want to attack people and defend Blizzard. Right, wrong, or indifferent -- that's all you're doing. You simply agree with Blizzard and simply don't grasp where others are coming from nor do I think you care to investigate why they feel the way they do.</div></div><hr />

There are 3.3 Western accounts at the moment. Not 2.1. The sample size used is 2.1 because not they don't track accounts not in guilds or just don't raid. Do you actually think blizzard is down to 2.1 million accounts in US and EU?</div></div><hr />

That's the ultimate way of &quot;being in touch with the community&quot;, isn't it ? A lot of players expect more transparency with the dev team of WoW than with their government. This is getting silly. Blizzard fell into the trap of communicating on every little aspect of the game. Now players expect a direct discussion with a dev, as an equal, expecting the feeling of being part of the dev team also. it's not realistic. I've seen on some comments on a youtube channel about wow, some guy saying &quot;blizzard should make you part of the developpment team&quot;, &quot;they should hire you&quot;. You're not a dev just because you're giving feedback on a game.<br />
The problem with the actual WoW is too much feedback. The devs are trying to give players everything they want and still keep their vision intact. But it's impossible and the game suffer from it. The feedback on Vanilla or TBC was more honest, and people didn't nitpick on everything. Or maybe they just accepted Blizzard's vision. Now they want a different game but still it being Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While your response was certainly more eloquent than Buu's, there are a few things you misunderstand.<br />
<br />
I wasn't mocking his nitpicking or hyperbole. I was calling into question his absurd mentality that a game developer should sacrifice whatever vision they have for their product simply to appease their customers.<br />
<br />
I'm NOT passionate about the game, never was. My stance doesn't come from that of a fanboy. I also am not worried about empty servers. Everyone I knew who played this game left DURING TBC and Wrath (and they weren't part of the ~3mil that returned for WoD either). Most of my time is spent doing solo content, anyway. You see, WoW didn't start losing subs during Cata. Everyone likes to talk about all the subs that left during Cata and MoP because they wrongfully believe that those expansions (and in effect, Blizzard's vision for the game) led to the downward trend on the quarterly graphs. WoW lost millions of subs from vanilla through TBC through WotLK. What happened around the time of Cata was that the half a decade old game stopped bringing in more players than it was losing. This is a whole different discussion, but I mention it because the whole &quot;Blizzard has been fucking up this game since Cata, and now this is the straw that broke the camel's back&quot; argument seems to come up often.<br />
<br />
I'm not telling you to &quot;love it or leave it&quot;. There's a HUGE range between those two extremes. You're wrong about me not knowing where the anger is coming from, but you're right about me not caring. I really, honestly, truly don't care about what direction you think this game should go. I also don't care what direction Blizzard decides to go. It's their product and they should be free to do with it as they will. While criticism and feedback are useful, expecting a company that develops artistic content to cater to your desires is not. In the end it's just a game and I will continue to play it as long as it continues to provide some level of enjoyment. While there are plenty of things I would like to change to make the game more tailored to what I want (some things that you would agree with, others that you would not), it's not my place to tell Blizzard that those changes are as it should be and that their game is shit without said changes.<br />
<br />
When I say something along the lines of &quot;if you don't like it then leave&quot;, I'm not saying it out of spite or to defend Blizzard. I'm fully prepared to leave the moment I no longer enjoy this game enough to balance out the cost.</div></div><hr />

Long ago the magic that once was an RPG went away. The minute the players start questioning the Dungeon Masters, it ceases to be an RPG. The developers are there to supply a worthwhile adventure, but the feedback over the years has removed more and more of the adventure and replaced it with 20 minute tasks that aren't fun but more repetitive, dungeons that aren't exciting but 20-30 minute free for alls, and less interaction with our fellow players and more interaction with things like Facebook and Twitter followers. The playerbase has become absolutely toxic, both on forums, here, fansites, youtube, in-game, etc. Players are no longer gamers, but people looking for something tailored to their individual or collective liking, rather than being given the Dungeon Master's parameters and playing what the DM had in mind.

Blizzard walked into their own trap of communicating too much, rather than letting them roll out the magic, and they get hammered every step of the way.

I'm obviously not privy to their thought process. Do remember there is a difference between individual intent and company policy.<br />

Greg, always wandered if Activision and Cata where the breaking points when the Buddy GC had to stop to chat in the boards.<br />
It became Blizzard policy, but it wasn't from Activision. Not sure what the policy is now of course.<br />
<br />
Wow, that's pretty interesting.<br />
It might be that the devs actually may have to say a great deal about the sad state of the game, but are not allowed to.<br />

<br />
This expansion is becoming a signature of poor communication and subscriber drops. At this rate, it won't be remembered as &quot;the expansion that brought WoW back&quot; but as &quot;the expansion where WoW lost tons of subs and also decided to kill flying in an interview.&quot;<br />

Second chart compares boss progression on a specific difficulty among the people who are actually attempting it. So like of that teeny 5% of players that actually do Mythic about half of them have completed half the bosses.<br />
<br />
Third chart is just the percent of people who have the Wing achieves, no point in trying to split into LFR/N/H/M as the first chart does that far more accurately than this would. I dunno if you could even reliably separate the data out.<br />

I am part of that category of people who don't mind, either way it goes, we're fine with it. Don't get me wrong, that's not for a lack of love for the game, but because I can adapt to new situations without making a huge deal out of them. I survived before flying and I'll survive when it's gone - not to mention I really don't mind the experiment in itself (which is what it was). I voice my concerns when I have them, but I also chose carefully my battles: Warlords of Draenor was clearly designed without flight in mind, the decision spurred a lot of feedback, which I am 100% positive Blizzard read given it was a huge change. Months in, there haven't been new arguments pro or against flying, it's the old same repeated all over again. There is the increased drama and flame, though.<br />
<br />
I wish that the vocal pro-flying crew realized that Blizzard hears you but disagrees. Let the concept sinks in. Seriously though, take a few minutes and let the idea really sink in. You might not agree with them disagreeing but that's just how it is. What you are doing now is throwing an epic tantrum which is just killing it for everyone. You are putting Blizzard in a position where they simply cannnot say anymore &quot;We were wrong&quot; or &quot;The experiment failed&quot; - even if they wanted to - and you know why? Because if they concede on this one huge controversal topic now that it has became totally toxic, they will be your bitch for the rest of their days. And that's worse for the game than non-flying: it means who cries louder dictates the direction WoW will go. I think we can agree it would be bad for the game, can't we? That's parenting 101: when your kids throw a tantrum, you don't give them what they want. <br />
<br />
Accept the fact it is Blizzard's decision and let it go. Stop talking about it, let the issue rest and you can hope to open a calm dialog before next expansion. They're not killing flying, people who can't take NO for an answer are killing flying for everyone. Stop it, please.</div></div><hr />

I do yes, that number makes a lot of sense. 1.2 million haven't logged in since April 1st. This is what pisses me off about Blizzard, they inflate their sub numbers with chinese time cards that have no bearing on us in the west.

Ian used to be a top raider and that was the main reason he was recruited to create raid content I believe.<br />
The reason his dev name isn't used is probably because it doesn't stand out(it's just &quot;Watcher&quot;, right?) and therefor could be problematic to use when talking about content that people that usually don't take their time to find and read these kind of things, read it.</div></div><hr />

Well said, when I think about my experience playing WoW now vs. how it used to be it's pretty sad to think about how there is almost no emergent gameplay at this point. It used to be fun just exploring new zones with friends, I had no clue about how to gear my Priest but it was fun to discover Thandol Span with my friends and try to Mind Control dark iron NPCs off the side of the bridge. I had a friend list of people I'd met on my server that I trusted to craft stuff or run dungeons with.<br />
<br />
Now all I care about is getting my ilevel up and sending my followers on missions, I know nobody outside of my guild, and any RPG edges seem to have been polished off of the modern WoW. Repetition has replaced adventure, maybe that's just inevitable after 10 years of playing the same game but I wish they'd focus more on systems that allow players to find their own fun and less LFR theme parks that get old after the first time.</div></div><hr />

Did those tweets add anything of substance to the discussion? &quot;You don't listen&quot; when they obviously fucking listen is getting really old. &quot;You didn't listen to me, some random fuck with bad ideas, and implement it immediately and therefore blahblahblah&quot; is more accurate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah because you guys have done such a bang up job with this entire expansion that everyone should just sing your praises right? Give me a fucking break.<br />
<br />
This has always been blizzards attitude and years gone by when they were the biggest and best mmo, they could get away with this piss poor attitude but now there is so much competition, there total inflexibility to even discuss compromise and to admit there in the wrong is costing them, more sub losses in the next quarter then they might , Might just start listening to people. <br />

people vote with there wallet and nobody is to big , blizzard need to remember this....</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Genoa</div><div class="date">2015-06-01, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not your game to design. It's their game. Companies are always open to receiving feedback, but they are in no way obligated to act on what the customer (or a certain segment of the customer base) wants. In the end it is most certainly their vision. It will always be the game they want to make, not the game their customers want them to make. If that drives certain customers away, then so be it. I'd rather them stick to whatever vision they have than try to cater to every whim of the player base (which is never 100% in agreement on anything anyway).<br />
<br />
<br />
In reality, people just want to be able to have cameras all around Blizzard's offices and watch them work all day long. That's the ultimate way of &quot;being in touch with the community&quot;, isn't it ? A lot of players expect more transparency with the dev team of WoW than with their government. This is getting silly. Blizzard fell into the trap of communicating on every little aspect of the game. Now players expect a direct discussion with a dev, as an equal, expecting the feeling of being part of the dev team also. it's not realistic. I've seen on some comments on a Youtube channel about wow, some guy saying &quot;blizzard should make you part of the development team&quot;, &quot;they should hire you&quot;. You're not a dev just because you're giving feedback on a game.<br />
The problem with the actual WoW is too much feedback. The devs are trying to give players everything they want and still keep their vision intact. But it's impossible and the game suffer from it. The feedback on Vanilla or TBC was more honest, and people didn't nitpick on everything. Or maybe they just accepted Blizzard's vision. Now they want a different game but still it being Warcraft.<br />
<br />
<br />
The game is no longer about being an RPG, it's just a game for people to play and get rewards in a new age of less work, big rewards. Long ago the magic that once was an RPG went away. The minute the players start questioning the Dungeon Masters, it ceases to be an RPG. The developers are there to supply a worthwhile adventure, but the feedback over the years has removed more and more of the adventure and replaced it with 20 minute tasks that aren't fun but more repetitive, dungeons that aren't exciting but 20-30 minute free for alls, and less interaction with our fellow players and more interaction with things like Facebook and Twitter followers. The playerbase has become absolutely toxic, both on forums, here, fansites, Youtube, in-game, etc. Players are no longer gamers, but people looking for something tailored to their individual or collective liking, rather than being given the Dungeon Master's parameters and playing what the DM had in mind. When Blizzard pushes back, players play the customer card. In the end we get a mish-mash of suggestions that tear a little bit away from the game that's lasted for a very long time.<br />
<br />
Blizzard walked into their own trap of communicating too much, rather than letting them roll out the magic, and they get hammered every step of the way. Maybe the game needs less subs, more unhappy snowflakes to actually stop playing, then we can get about the business of gaming again with better design and less whining.<br />
<br />
<br />
There have been many valid points made about the flying-issue, on both sides of it. I am part of that category of people who don't mind, either way it goes, we're fine with it. Don't get me wrong, that's not for a lack of love for the game, but because I can adapt to new situations without making a huge deal out of them. I survived before flying and I'll survive when it's gone - not to mention I really don't mind the experiment in itself (which is what it was). I voice my concerns when I have them, but I also chose carefully my battles: Warlords of Draenor was clearly designed without flight in mind, the decision spurred a lot of feedback, which I am 100% positive Blizzard read given it was a huge change. Months in, there haven't been new arguments pro or against flying, it's the old same repeated all over again. There is the increased drama and flame, though.<br />
<br />
I wish that the vocal pro-flying crew realized that Blizzard hears you but disagrees. Let the concept sinks in. Seriously though, take a few minutes and let the idea really sink in. You might not agree with them disagreeing but that's just how it is. What you are doing now is throwing an epic tantrum which is just killing it for everyone. You are putting Blizzard in a position where they simply cannot say anymore &quot;We were wrong&quot; or &quot;The experiment failed&quot; - even if they wanted to - and you know why? Because if they concede on this one huge controversial topic now that it has became totally toxic, they will be your bitch for the rest of their days. And that's worse for the game than non-flying: it means who cries louder dictates the direction WoW will go. I think we can agree it would be bad for the game, can't we? That's parenting 101: when your kids throw a tantrum, you don't give them what they want. <br />
<br />
Accept the fact it is Blizzard's decision and let it go. Stop talking about it, let the issue rest and you can hope to open a calm dialog before next expansion. They're not killing flying, people who can't take NO for an answer are killing flying for everyone. Stop it, please.<br />

With so little content, raiding same raid at different difficulties for half a year wont help either. And they wonder why are they dropping in subs. Today's gamers dont need a commitment, they want to play the game when they feel like it. With all the busy schedule no one needs to reserve a 4,5 hours every night to be wiping 200 times before killing a boss. On the graph there's 1-2% of players who like doing that, but if blizzard want more players they need to think about 98% and redesign raiding system to not be so hard.( talking about mythic, LFR and normal are useless and doesnt count, heroic is ok imo). Hardcore guilds can still race to clear the raid faster than others, but the other players should feel the joy of killing the mythic bosses too and get the drop from them. Only 0.4% killed mythic blackhand? Come on.</div></div><hr />

How was it touted as a major feature? Because it was in the patch notes? It was the PLAYERS that made a huge fucking deal about it. It got an incredibly brief mention in the 6.1 feature Blizzard trailer. I'd hardly call that a major feature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway those numbers are very interesting. My little casual group is nothing special but it's surprising how low the Blackhand numbers are.<br />
<br />
Not really. There's little incentive to do blackhand. His gear is the same ilvl as the rest of the foundry and his difficulty is somewhere in the middle of the NEXT difficulty. So players usually just skip him, do the first few bosses of the next level, then go back and do him once they have 5-10 more ilvls, if they even go back.</div></div><hr />

I actually agree 100% that the dev's shouldn't engage the players so much. I actually liked when a patch wasn't completely mapped out before it was even released. <br />
<br />
However, the main problem that every single one of these posts focuses on, is that you trust Blizzard to make decisions like they used to, when there is tons of evidence to the contrary. <br />
<br />
Their design has shifted from being a &quot;dungeon master&quot; to a shopkeeper. You can see it in all the games they put out now. Diablo 3 was an absolute mess when it came out and to even play the game you had to use an auction house that included features to allow them to make a cut off of players selling items for real money (although I will give credit where it is due, they have tried hard to improve D3 since it first came out). HotS revolves around buying heroes. HS revolves around buying cards. WoW has paid leveling (including a forced one to buy the expansion), mounts/pets/cosmetics on the cash shop. The one main game Blizzard currently has out that doesn't include a cash shop of some kind is Starcraft 2, and they have all but abandoned the upkeep of that game between expansion releases. You are lucky to see a few balance patches, but that is the extent they go to support a game that doesn't provide them cash shop opportunities, and why their viewer numbers for the game have declined rapidly since they launched it.<br />
<br />
Do you understand? This is not the company you all seem to think it is anymore, and trusting them with a vision does not bode well with many people because of what their current track record is. Even more damaging is their numbers, and particularly what they think is worthwhile to invest in:<br />

<br />
You tell me how it makes sense that from 2011 to 2014, in a time where they have more big titles than ever, that they have REDUCED the budget into product development and instead increased their budget into sales and marketing by a significant amount? <br />
<br />
The vision has shifted. The evidence is all over the place, and whether under the guise of listening to players or not, there are many logical reasons to not trust what Blizzard has planned for their &quot;vision&quot; of the game.

I could agree with you except for one thing. Why, if there is no flying in WOD or future expansions, do they keep making flying mounts? If there is no more flying, they need to stop making flying mounts period.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Each of those games is it's own IP. The maintenance and upkeep related to StarCraft, as well as the needs of its players, are different from WoW and its players, or Hearthstone and it's players. WoW is an MMO, StarCraft is an RTS, HotS is a MOBA, Hearthstone is a cardgame, etc. <br />
<br />
Are we talking about Blizzard Entertainment, or Activision Blizzard? There is a difference. The guy you linked to is mostly speaking about Activision Blizzard, and the numbers he provides includes marketing, sales, etc for Activision's titles like COD, Destiny, etc. Blizzard Entertainment has nothing to do with operating expenses for those IPs. I'm willing to discuss fiscal performance, but you need to decide which we're talking about here.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, while I'm not going to question this guy's forecasting capabilities, I am more inclined to follow the outlook advise from well-regarded brokers like Baird, Cowen, Piper Jaffray, and Barclays, all of which have raised their outlooks for Activision Blizzard based on product pipelines and subscriber numbers. This guy is criticizing HotS for its lack of market penetration... it doesn't even officially release until tomorrow, June 2.</div></div><hr />

Well if Blizzard heard and disagreed with the community and are still going forward with canning flying, then why as (Laylriana in the post above this one said) are they still making flying mounts for the shop and the Corrupted Dreadraven mount from apexis crystals.. Even the mount from Mythic Archimonde is supposed to have a flying mode, people want to be able to use them in current content when at max level.. <br />
<br />
Flying has been an integral part of the game since the release of Burning Crusade where you get to max level and purchase flying with the exception of Cataclysm (where you could fly while leveling).. The one thing you have to really ask is this for 8 years we have had a major feature that is flying and all of a sudden it is taken away from everyone, and the thing you have to ask yourself is this what is Blizzards real motive for suddenly canning flying when for 8 years it has been a non issue.. I have a theory but at this time it is only that a theory but with what Blizzard are doing of late I reckon most people can guess what it is..</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't need a theory. They flat out said they didn't like the impact of unconstrained flying on gameplay... Triviliazation of questing and exploration, abuse in resource collection and pvp, etc. All those effects are demonstrably true. Doesn't mean they couldnt have come up with different options that allowed flight in non-critical areas of each zone or allow unrestricted flight earned as an achievement pre-req'd by a deep questing achievement per toon, etc. I would love to see a tough obstacle that rewarded flight... Not just a simple gold sink like it used to be.<br />
<br />
Bottomline: no conspiracy required. Still wish they'd find another way to resolve.</div></div><hr />

Most people who have worked in customer service and are honest are familiar with circumstances when the company they are working for essentially tells the employees they need to push something that is effectively a bad deal for the customer.

First, I believe everything in this addon is a ramp up that WoW will go Buy2play. That assumption can be wrong, my points should still be valid.<br />
<br />
- reduction of server load/bandwidth<br />
There were changes to the mob visibility range and I think this happened around Pandaria. <br />
The introduction of garrisons is a deliberate choice to further reduce bandwidth to a bare minimum.<br />
The removal of flying is also a deliberate choice that reduces bandwidth and server load drastically.<br />
Remember the horrible launch? We said, give more server power. They said, no it'll die down. It did, as people gave up.<br />
<br />
Why? All these new games (Hearthstone, Hots, Overwatch) take a huge amount of server load/bandwidth. How to save a lot of money? Reduce the load/bandwidth of the game that they were originally for and use it for newer games. <br />
<br />
Now, my conclusion could be wrong. After all, servers aren't that pricey anymore, nor is bandwidth. You could pick everything apart I said and argue with game design choice, story choice, etc... The facts still stand that they are very actively reducing the load/bandwidth and I see it as foreshadowing from a technical standpoint.<br />
<br />
The whole loneliness feeling in garrisons were clear from the beta and should have also been clear to every designer in the WoW team. So if they are still going with it, there must be something else, right? Garrisons are not THAT cool to break one of the most important words in MMO. WoD isn't MASSIVELY anymore. Quite the opposite.<br />
Also the debacle about flying mounts. Blizzs arguments are just so bad. Have we really gotten better world/level design? It just doesn't make any sense. Instead they went on this emotional roller coaster and used divide and conquer tactics of us vs. them or the pro-flying against the anti-flying crowd. What has the pro-flying crowd gained? They just lost an option and they are even proud of it, after all they are on Blizzs side.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Divide and conquer seems like a strategy used by a company that sees its customers as 'the enemy', and unfortunately this has become a widespread worldview among companies in many different fields. If you have a product that you believe your customers absolutely need to buy, it is easy to fall into the way of thinking that makes you see your customers as either dupes who you are trying to peddle bad service/products to, or somebody who you need to exploit and extract the maximum amount of value from. <br />
<br />
Look at how prevalent this way of thinking is in the newest wing of the gaming market, namely mobile gaming. Mobile games have been insanely profitable because they preyed upon their customers with a business model that is focused upon extracting the maximum amount of cash out of their players. They played off of psychology to drain those they see as the 'whales' in these games dry. I have met people who spent thousands of dollars a month on games that use this model, and the truth is that these are not 'games' so much as they are targeted electronic crack for those with a specific psychology. <br />
<br />
I don't see why so many people are proud of siding with a company that is sliding down the slippery slope of exploitation.</div></div><hr />

I actually liked when a patch wasn't completely mapped out before it was even released. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes I wonder what would happen if they released things a little at a time rather than one big massive roll out. Does items to a vendor really take 4-6 months to hash out and put into the game? Does adding a quest hub on a island take 6 months to a year? <br />
<br />
I get that raids and dungeons take time. Maybe its just me. I never got the whole lets take half a year and release everything at once. Might be better received and less &quot;bored&quot; if they did some here and there. Only thing is would be the whole hey XYZ got THEIR stuff where'd mine????</div></div><hr />

It's not at all realistic to design ALL armor to fit ALL char models just in case. But look for any reason to take issue w/ us. (CM_Zarhym)<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently selfie cams were an appropriate use of dev time. Not farahlon though.&quot;<br />
So you admit you only count additions to the game YOU care about. This is helpful. (CM_Zarhym)<br />
I'm kindof in disbelief at what a snarky asshole Zarhym is. I know the WoW community is very vitriolic, but that's still not a good way to conduct yourself as a representative.<br />
<br />
Firstly, a set of armor shouldn't be implemented if it hasn't been properly designed for whatever races/classes can wear it. Simply sloppy. There shouldn't be any defending that.<br />
<br />
Secondly, it's perfectly fine to say that dev time would've been better spent designing basic gameplay/content that all players will enjoy such as a new region, over something insignificant and trivial such as a selfie cam/twitter integration which most players didn't ask for or desire in the first place.<br />
<br />
I'm not opposed to its existence, I'm sure some people enjoy it, but the comment was more about priorities and putting out important content first. When Blizzard is only putting out miniscule crap that the majority will not frequently make use of and enjoy as opposed to lasting meaningful content... they tend to get irked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a really demoralizing, almost childish answer.<br />
<br />
Humility is the key to creativity, genius, and wisdom. I am not seeing any of it in Zarhym's answers lately. Instead he is coming across burned out by his job. I totally understand if he is, but in any case, he needs to take a break as does some of the management over the game.<br />
<br />
They are dead set on their vision of cheaper and easier development and seeing just how far they can slowly cut from the game before players revolt beyond a certain point.<br />
<br />
Example- they have spent a significant amount of time telling us why they do not want to create new quest chains, fixing 1-60 questing to make a bit of sense to new players, and creating NEW dungeons.<br />
<br />
In MoP's development, I was very excited to see them announce they can create new instances much faster by reusing existing world locations. They did this with most dungeons and scenarios. The problem was, they also figured out it was cheaper to just not make new dungeons either.<br />
<br />
Watcher is slick a politician and I see they are betting on smooth lawyer talk to soothe the player base.<br />
<br />
For myself and a few of my friends in and out of the game, we only believe what he says when he is talking about why X will not be added to the game. If he says they have a lot more of this expansion to roll out, be wary. The purpose of this Q&amp;A is to curb the financial bleeding they seem to be experiencing.<br />
<br />
Remember- people may not always remember what you do or say, but they will always remember how you made them feel.<br />
<br />
That is something that Team WoW's management does not seem to understand.</div></div><hr />

With so little content, raiding same raid at different difficulties for half a year wont help either. And they wonder why are they dropping in subs. Today's gamers dont need a commitment, they want to play the game when they feel like it. With all the busy schedule no one needs to reserve a 4,5 hours every night to be wiping 200 times before killing a boss. On the graph there's 1-2% of players who like doing that, but if blizzard want more players they need to think about 98% and redesign raiding system to not be so hard.( talking about mythic, LFR and normal are useless and doesnt count, heroic is ok imo). Hardcore guilds can still race to clear the raid faster than others, but the other players should feel the joy of killing the mythic bosses too and get the drop from them. Only 0.4% killed mythic blackhand? Come on.<br />
<br />
If you think heroic is fine and mythic is too hard, then....don't do mythic? That's what the difficulty levels are for. How does taking /away/ choice improve the player base? I don't demand that normal and LFR be taken away because they're too easy (though LFR could do with a buff to MoP/Dragon Soul level), I just don't do them. If Mythic were made easier then the &quot;joy of killing the mythic bosses&quot; would be rather hollow wouldn't it? I personally think that some people just shouldn't be playing on the basis that if they can't find an hour or 3 to sit down to play, ever, then this isn't the game for them. <br />
<br />
Also, 4/5 hours a night? Get real, noone raids like that unless they're Method, Paragon etc. racing to world first. If you are raiding like that and not seeing progress, then I'd find a new guild. Most people just do mythic because they enjoy the challenge.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dejablue</div><div class="date">2015-06-03, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of conflation and confluence of events have made the participation of all raiding not just mythic lower than previous expansions at similar points in the expansion's life. I would like to point out what I am championing which is that guilds have been devastated.<br />
<br />
MoP had literally 80% of all Mythic guilds as 10 man. The transition to 20 man meant that literally 40% of all Mythic raiders had to fold their guild or as players, find a new guild. That is not counting the 20% of players that lost a raid spot or guild with the reduction from 25 to 20 for 25 man guilds.<br />
<br />
That is a lot of raiders, approaching half.<br />
<br />
The problem we are having is threefold, first it is art, Blizzard has a vision and it may not be the one that you the player has. That means that you may need to find a new game, just like old school Metallica fans may have found a new band after whatever their favorite album was, puppets, Justice or Black. But Metallica moved on and did not go back, although Death magnetic was reminiscent of that.<br />
<br />
The second is communication. Having that artistic vision is all well and good, but you do need to keep your audience in mind particularly within a genre such as RPG, just like metal, using the metallica analogy. That doesn't mean they cant &quot;Blizzardize&quot; game concepts etc. but the community needs to be involved. Fan Service, and not lip service, needs to happen, currently it is not.<br />
<br />
Last of all is the community at large, not just talking to them but supporting them. Fan sites are great but in game there is little for the guild leaders to assist in recruitment, management and organization.<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to step back and not only involve the community but get involved with the community and provide us with the tools we need to continue to feel a part of the WoW community, to be excited and proud of being a WoW player.<br />
<br />
That does not mean we get to design the classes or that they appease us, just as Metallica's fans do not write the songs with them.<br />
<br />
But Metallica's fans do get to do things like vote on set lists, their last arena tour was a set list voted on by the fans. I am NOT saying we need polls for everything, I am not saying we need to vote, it is just an example of showing APPRECIATION of the community and letting them be involved and of being involved with them.</div></div><hr />
