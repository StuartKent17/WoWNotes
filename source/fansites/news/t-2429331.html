Mythic Uldir Progression<br />
The race is on in Mythic Uldir with five guilds at 4/8 already! Method is doing coverage (https://www.method.gg/raidprogress) and streaming progression (https://www.method.gg/method-to-live-stream-mythic-uldir).<br />

<br />
<br />
Reorigination Array Clarifications<br />
Uldir Armor can have the Laser Matrix (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/280559-laser-matrix) or Archive of the Titans (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/280555-archive-of-the-titans) traits, enabling Reorigination Array (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/280573-reorigination-array).<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a hidden weekly quest to kill 3 Uldir bosses, granting another stack of Reorigination Array (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/280573-reorigination-array).<br />
This hidden quest is always present so if you have swapped pieces of gear from the trait, you'll have the same number of stacks still.<br />
You start accumulating stacks right away, on any difficulty, even before you get the Power.<br />
This buff can stack up to 10 times, granting 75 of your highest secondary stat per stack. <br />
The buff doesn't scale based on raid difficulty. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It is a clever system but I do have some insight to share on how it works. Apologies for the lengthy description but I wanted to explain it given what you pointed out now that I have some information to share on it.<br />
<br />
So Reorigination Array is a secondary bonus to traits from Archive of the Titans or Laser Matrix. When those are selected on a piece of Azerite gear that is equipped it provides Reorigination Array. This is a passive buff that is always up while you're inside the instance.<br />
<br />
There is a Reorigination Array hidden quest associated to your character that tracks and gradually improves this buff over time as you progress week over week within Uldir. Every week there is essentially a weekly quest that tracks your kills, and once you kill 3 bosses in Uldir you gain a stack added to Reorigination Array. You do not need a piece for this to track your kills. So if you killed 3 bosses last week and got your piece this week with Archive of the Titans, don't worry as you'd correctly be at 2 stacks if you killed 3 bosses this week as well. This stacks up to 10 and each stack provides 75 of your highest secondary stat. This also tracks regardless of difficulty so you can even track and obtain the items with these traits on Raid Finder.<br />
<br />
Once you obtain a piece you'll notice the Reorigination Array tooltip changes depending on some certain conditional statuses. If you haven't killed any bosses this week in Uldir it will read additionally &quot;Defeat 3 more powerful foes in Uldir to increase the effectiveness of Reorigination Array.&quot;. This will be under the current bonus it provides if you have earned any stacks already. As you kill bosses for your weekly count you'll see this counter go down until it disappears as you've earned your 3 needed kills for the week and you'll instantly get that next stack.<br />

It's pretty obvious that there is SOMETHING that leads to Horde players excelling.<br />
<br />
It could be something real such as gear or racial skills that lead hardcore players to conclude that Horde is the best faction to play.<br />
<br />
It could be something perceived.. even the appearance that Horde are treated better (such as.. a variety of reputation mount rewards for Horde versus three boring horses for Alliance) may lead hardcore players to play Horde in anticipation of better treatment in the future. <br />
<br />
Whatever the cause, the effect is real.</div></div><hr />

yea that part is SUPER opinion based .</div></div><hr />

This expansion did nothing to absolve that. They nerfed belf racial and then made a fight that DISTINCTLY benefits from having lots of belfs.<br />
<br />
Everything has been to hordes benefit this expansion so far. Warfronts, Emissaries, racials yet again; all extra advantages.</div></div><hr />

I think my point is, 19/20 of the top guilds being horde isn't a coincidence. SOMETHING draws hardcore players to the horde faction.<br />
<br />
I'm merely exploring possible causes as to why this happens.</div></div><hr />

horde racials have been statistically overpowered since vanilla, trolls and orcs originally and trolls and undead recently.<br />
as such, many alliance world first competing guilds eventually faction transferred to horde to even be competitive since in the end DPS determines how long the fight is.</div></div><hr />

As stated above, has to do with some horde racials having a small dps benefit, nothing more.</div></div><hr />

The answer is and always has been superior racials for hardcore raiding. After a bunch of top end guilds transferred to Horde back in the day (yes many of them started as Alliance, including Method) the rest were basically forced to follow suit if they wanted to be part of the community that builds around such guilds.</div></div><hr />
