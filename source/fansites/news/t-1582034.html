Ability Consolidation and Refinement<br />
<br />

Black Arrow (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/3674)’s cooldown is reset if it is dispelled.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rotation Depth and Talents<br />
We’ve changed the combat rotations of each Hunter specialization (primarily through Ability Pruning) with the goal of them being a platform to build upon with talents. To facilitate this, we’ve modified several talents to add additional rotational depth. Hunters had many talent options which added abilities to their rotation, but most of them had quite simple usage, with little interaction with your rotation or other abilities. Now, there should be more of a variety; still some simple talents, but also some talents that create a more engaging combat rotation.<br />
<br />
Barrage (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/120360) now has a 20 second cooldown (down from 30 seconds), costs 60 Focus (up from 30 Focus), and its damage has been increased by 100%.<br />
Murder of Crows has been changed. Its duration, cost, and cooldown have been reduced by 50%. It no longer has a shorter cooldown when used on low health targets. Instead, its cooldown is reset if the target dies.<br />
Fervor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/82726) has been replaced with a new passive ability, Steady Focus (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53224).<br />
<br />
Steady Focus (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53224) increases Focus Regeneration by 50% for 10 seconds after using Cobra Shot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/77767) or Steady Shot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56641) twice in a row, or after using Focusing Shot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Survival Changes<br />
Apart from rotational changes through Ability Pruning, changes for Survival Hunters mostly center on Lock and Load (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56343). We changed how Lock and Load (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56343) is triggered to increase the value of Multistrike, provide gameplay depth and the ability to pool damage more. Also note the new passive ability, Survivalist, which increases multistrike chance by 10%, in order to give Survival Hunters some baseline Multistrike chance.<br />
<br />
(Line moved to Ability Consolidation and Refinement.) Black Arrow (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/3674) now deals 60% more damage, inflicts Shadow damage every 3 seconds (up from every 2 seconds), has a duration of 18 seconds (down from 20 seconds), and triggers Lock and Load (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56343) on Multistrike hits.<br />
(Line moved to Ability Consolidation and Refinement) Lock and Load (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56343) effects have been incorporated into Black Arrow (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/3674) and have been redesigned.<br />
<br />
Lock and Load (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56343) now causes the next Explosive Shot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53301) to not trigger its cooldown, but no longer causes it to be free or reset the ability's current cooldown. This effect can stack up to 5 times.<br />
<br />
Survivalist is a new passive ability learned by Survival Hunters at level 10.<br />
<br />
Survivalist increases Multistrike damage by 20% the chance to Multistrike by 10%, and causes the Hunter to gain 15% health over 10 seconds after killing a target.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage<br />
Ability Consolidation and Refinement<br />
<br />
Frostbolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116) can no longer be used to heal the Mage's Water Elemental.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frost Changes<br />
<br />
The Brain Freeze (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/44549) effect now increases Frostfire Bolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/44614) damage by 25% 15%, and can now stack up to 2 times. It also no longer triggers from the Bomb Talents, and instead has a 10% chance to trigger from Frostbolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116) casts. Each Multistrike of Frostbolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116) increases that cast's chance by an additional 25%. (Total of 60% on double-Multistrikes).<br />

<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin <br />
Ability Consolidation and Refinement<br />
<br />
Selfless Healer (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85804) no longer causes Bastion of Glory to apply to Flash of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/19750). For Holy Paladins, it now increases the healing of Flash of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/19750) on others by 35% per stack (up from 20%). For Retribution and Protection Paladins, the effect on Flash of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/19750) remains unchanged.<br />
(Moved to Holy Changes) Tower of Radiance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85512)’s effects have been merged into baseline Beacon of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53652).<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Beacon of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53652) now has a small Mana cost.<br />
Tower of Radiance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85512)’s effects have been changed and merged into baseline Beacon of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53652).<br />
<br />
Tower of Radiance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85512) now causes Flash of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/19750) and Holy Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/635) on a Beacon of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53652) target to refund 40% of the spell’s Mana cost instead of generating 1 Holy Power.<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy Changes<br />
<br />
Divine Providence is a new passive ability for Holy Priests.<br />
<br />
Divine Providence increases the amount of the Multistrike stat gains from all sources by 5%, and increases the damage and healing of Multistrikes by 20% 25%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue <br />
Combat Changes<br />
<br />
Revealing Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/84617) now grants Sinister Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1752) a 25% chance to generate an extra Combo Point (up from 20%) deals 20% more damage, but no longer advances Bandit's Guile (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/84654).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman <br />

<br />

Earth Shock (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8042) will consume any charges beyond 1, dealing their total damage to the enemy target.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Elemental and Enhancement Changes<br />
<br />
Magma Totem (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8190)’s damage has been increased by 100%, and now ticks faster with Haste.<br />
Maelstrom Weapon (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/51530)’s chance to trigger has been reduced by 20%.<br />
Searing Totem (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/3599) Searing Bolt now has a 2-second cast time (up from 1.5 seconds), but casts faster with Haste, and its damage has been increased by 120% 65%.<br />

We also tweaked the design of Master Demonologist, in order to solve some edge cases, and simplify and clarify its effects.<br />
<br />
Mastery: Master Demonologist (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/77219) has been slightly changed. It now passively increases all damage by 6% regardless of form. While in Metamorphosis (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/103958), it further increases the damage of Touch of Chaos (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/112089), Chaos Wave, Doom, Immolation Aura, and Soul Fire (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/6353) while by 12%. <br />

<br />
Protection: Heavy Repercussions: Shield Slam (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/23922) deals 50% additional damage while Shield Block (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/2565) or Shield Charge is active.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enrage and Deep Wounds<br />
With the introduction of one of the level-100 Warrior Talents, which deals Fire damage, We also expanded Enrage (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/13046) to affect all damage, not just Physical damage, and increased its duration slightly so that it can cover burst windows like Colossus Smash (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/86346) adequately. We're also making a change to the design of Deep Wounds (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115768), to try to limit is effectiveness in PvP, without hurting its effectiveness in PvE. <br />
<br />

.Well we all want to hear it. MM thoughts/impressions?<br />
.I was pleasantly surprised, actually. The Bombardment weaving, Thrill of the Hunt, and Kill Shots added more than I expected. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502618207514284032))<br />
You seem to be the only person positive about MM in WoD. Why can't I find any positive reviews about MM changes ?<br />
As a player, I had fun, but I'm coming into it from a very different perspective. Both mine and your perspectives... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502913015679688708))<br />
...are valid and valuable. (Mine=inexperienced playing it, at least recently, and yours=very experienced playing it) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502913231015272450))<br />
As a *developer* however, those are both perspectives that we need to try to satisfy, and we totally understand... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502913360778641409))<br />
...your point of view, and are looking at ways to satisfy both, better. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502913485752135680))<br />
<br />
are you guys gonna do another pass on talents? I think some hunter talents could use some work.<br />
Unlikely at this stage that talents will be redesigned, but they will definitely be tuned. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/502924427172904967))<br />
<br />
How come the extra 5 yards and camo not breaking for 6 sec was scrapped from MM and Surv? I thought those was really cool perks.<br />
Range was replaced with Sniper Training. Camo was too strong/frustrating, so was cut. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502945226197987329))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br />
so this supposed healer balance patch ignored MW ENTIRELY. Reason behind ignoring in this round of tuning? MW needs help BAD<br />
False. Enveloping down 30%, Uplift up 30%, ChEx down 10%, ChiBrew down 1 tea, Jab cost up 8%, Emin up 43%, Pool Renews up 15%, (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502823460087689216))<br />
Wait, Uplift got buffed 30%? Don't see that reflected in any patch notes or data mining. I see the rest of them.<br />
Well it wouldn't be in patch notes. Double checked, looks like those two changes are actually in next build, not last. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502945076394225664))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
hey watcher. You tweeted me months ago about account wide tabards. no updates still?<br />
It's something that will likely accompany a transmog revamp/UI since it's a very similar sort of system (cosmetic appearance). (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/502887273361182720))<br />
<br />
I'll never give up. - This .39% DR and .72% Damage bonus is really terrible as a 4 set...<br />
.The PvP set bonuses with Versatility are completely not tuned. They'll probably end up in the 10% range. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/502921705249964040))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Will there ever be an implementation of RBGs at BlizzCon? In example, a booth where some of the top RBG teams can Vs. One another?<br />
Not this Blizzcon. Something to think about for the future perhaps. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/502852474555097088))<br />
<br />
Something we're exploring in an upcoming build: Discipline gets Silence baseline. We expect mixed reactions. Please try it on beta. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/502896996483481600))<br />
Not much help against mele specs, i think baseline fear still in need.<br />
Warriors and Rogues, no. Ret and DK, yes. Monk and Enhance to a small extent. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/502903317006012416))<br />

<br />
F*ck you, too, Blizzard. This sucked when it was applied to potions and this change sucks just as much, if not more. It's called a class perk. All classes have their perks... and their trade-offs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A Business marketing their products??! HOW FUCKING DARE THEY! :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Also people like you forget that when they did that year of no BlizzCon, WoW and Starcraft were their main titles. D3 was still only new and didn't have much news for it, Starcraft had just got a new expansion which required little news for it AND they were working on a WoW expansion.<br />
<br />
Blizzard now has WoW, Starcraft+expacs, D3+expacs, Hearthstone AND Heroes of the Storm.<br />
<br />
It makes sense to be able to have a BlizzCon every year now regardless.<br />
<br />
people need to really think before they start dribbling shit.</div></div><hr />

You shouldn't be surprised though it's how it goes.<br />
<br />
Company says something won't happen for x good reasons (cash shops), couple of years down (cash shops happen)<br />
They don't want to homogenize classes, bam abilities get thrown around, classes aren't unique anymore flavor goes down the drain<br />
<br />
Then they put out an expac and it's perfectly acceptable in quality (according to them) then when we get to 60% through they talk about all their mistakes and hype up the next expac as the one that'll 'learn from those'.<br />
<br />
Please we've been there. I'm so sad blizz lost its soul because of Activision/kotick</div></div><hr />

Are the food buffs in WoD just proportionally stronger than they were in MoP? I haven't played in a few months (Bored with SoO and waiting until WoD) but I don't remember Epicurean ever getting to a point where it was so much better than another trait to warrant that big of a nerf.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lagmoose</div><div class="date">2014-08-28, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol Epicurean nerf. Wow. I guess they deemed that too OP and had to nerf something to balance out nerfs across the board. Don't remember too many people saying &quot;You know, that food buff pandas have is so OP and needs to be nerfed!!&quot;<br />
<br />
That Healthstone cooldown nerf is pretty lol too. Guess I need to get on the stick and get my green fire before 6.0</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've got more people on hand than they did in 2012. We don't know what happens behind the doors and I doubt sending a few people to do a few industry events really has that much effect on anything development wise. Blizzcon is an in company event, so it obviously requires them to host and manage everything to do with it. Sending people to an event is NOWHERE near the same as hosting your own. Be annoyed that WoD has been delayed by all means, but getting annoyed about a company /marketing/ their product? Christ the WoW community is NEVER fucking happy, why is everyone so bitter, all of the time?<br />
<br />
<br />
You shouldn't be surprised though it's how it goes.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
C'mon, the devs arn't robots, a lot can change in a couple of years. If they never changed their mind about anything we'd be stuck with Vanilla class balances. People /do/ change their mind, the devs are human. Has the cash shop had any meaningful effect on the game? No. It's purely cosmetic mounts and pets. Yes the level boost is there, but really, most people don't want to level anymore, you even get a free one when you buy WoD, so it pays for itself straight out of the box. It's a time saver, nothing more, it doesn't give you an advantage over anyone else. <br />
<br />
And yes, they do say they'll learn from their mistakes. Part of a mistake is that you can't forsee it. What they think works now might not work in the long term. What we think works now might not work in the long term. Things that work now, might not work in 6.2. And it's no good listening to the entire fan base because most of them just yell and scream without any semblence of saying anything useful, or contradict each other. Do we expect Blizzard to have clairvoyance now? They may have a bronze dragonflight in their game, but they certainly don't have them in the basement of Blizzard HQ in order to see exactly what might and might not work. <br />
<br />
Certain things can only have the consequences shown by actually happening, or how certain things effect them over the course of an expansion. at least they do try and learn from their mistakes, which is why things change so much each expansion, as opposed to other companies who refuse to listen to their fan base at all. Nothing is going to be perfect all of the time (which the WoW fanbase seems to except without fail), evaluating, critiquing and admitting what you did wrong in your own work is very good practice.</div></div><hr />

Now not only is it the worst knockback in the game but now it has a 15 yard range. Awesome Blizzard. You may as well remove the spell. It has the worst velocity of all knockbacks, bugs the most and now you have to stand on the player to knock them back 3 yards. Cool cheers blizz. Another excellent idea. <br />
<br />
Now nerf the range AND velocity of everyone elses just to make it a bit easier for melee to tunnel you into the ground and gg you've screwed the game up a bit more :) pricks</div></div><hr />

As a long time (long... long...too long) survival hunter lover, I've been wishing for something like this forever. I'd love some sort of dispel protection like Unstable Affliction has, but I'll take what I can get :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok and... Why? I hope there is reason behind this to be revealed in the next expansion, because right now it just looks like a negative thing to do for those who like to solo old/low priority current content.</div></div><hr />

WHY???????? Most mages weren't even aware of that spell and it helped a lot when trying to solo stuff.<br />

Now I'm definitely abandoning my mage. All its fun has been nerfed into oblivion.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I ended up accidentally casting it on my water elemental when I deselected the wrong target, and didn't realize until the cast was over that I was hitting my water elemental.</div></div><hr />

It was better than Typhoon from the start. Yet it is still the same. I don't get the logics. I don't think Thunderstorm is too OP. I just don't know why do they think Typhoon is. The knockback distance is so little it barely drops enemies out of melee range.</div></div><hr />
