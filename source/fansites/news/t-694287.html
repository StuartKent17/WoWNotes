Icecrown Citadel Attempts removed on Normal<br />
After each region's maintenance this week, raids will no longer lose attempts on wipes in Normal mode for Professor Putricide, Blood-Queen Lana'thel, Sindragosa, and the Lich King. There will still be limited attempts in Heroic mode.<br />
<br />
We will continue to monitor developments in Icecrown Citadel in the future, especially since the Heroic difficulty has been unlocked by a significant number of raids. <br />
<br />
Update Follow up time! <br />
<br />
Q: If you extend your raid lockout this week, will you still lose attempts on Normal after the hotfix?<br />
A: No.<br />
<br />
Q: If you run completely out of attempts on Heroic, will the wing bosses and Lich King no longer respawn, even if the difficulty is switched to Normal?<br />
A: YES. So leave an attempt left if you wish to kill them on Normal. I'll try and correct this in a future update.<br />
<br />
Q: Why is the counter still visible in Normal?<br />
A: The hotfix being applied just stops the counter decrementing, and nothing more. <br />

Recent In-Game Fixes - February 2010 - 02/08<br />
Listed below are recent fixes we have applied to the game. Keep in mind that some of these changes may not be active until after the realm has been restarted.<br />
<br />
To review previous in-game fixes, please visit: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=21723843880&amp;sid=1<br />
<br />
02/08<br />
Sindragosa's Mystic Buffet will now pulse every 6 six seconds, up from 5 seconds. In the normal 10 player encounter the debuff increase has also been slightly reduced.<br />
In the Toravon encounter, the effect of the Whiteout debuff has been reduced. Additionally, the damage done by Frozen Orbs has been reduced. <br />
<br />
Patch 3.3.2 - Deathcharger Mounts<br />
Patch 3.3.2 introduced a new Crimson Deathcharger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73313/crimson-deathcharger/) mount spell to the game, I'm not really sure where this mount is supposed to drop but I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't fully implemented yet. <br />
<br />
There is only one mount spell, but there are actually two new deathchargers creatures Azure Deathcharger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/39045/azure-deathcharger/) and Crimson Deathcharger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/39046/crimson-deathcharger/), it could be the sign of another faction-based quest/achievement reward in the future. Keep in mind that according to Blizzard, patch 3.3.2 wasn't the last minor patch to be deployed before the release of Cataclysm.<br />

Blue posts<br />
Love is in the Air Perfumes (+75AP buff, etc ...)<br />
These items are set to disappear when the Love is in the Air event ends. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23041985191-love-is-in-the-air-perfume-question.html))<br />
<br />
Easier itemization in Cataclysm<br />
We aren't trying to kill spreadsheets or simulators, and I'm not even sure we could. The situations where two pieces have different stats but provide an equal dps increase are always going to be rare.<br />
<br />
The problem we're actually trying to solve is where one stat is so far superior to other stats that the rest of the item is irrelevant. Currently, most casters prefer haste over crit to the extent where they might use an item from a previous tier. That's not ideal (though obviously something else could be going on with their decision, like they are passing to someone else to be nice or they have a better upgrade in mind on the next boss or whatever). In Cataclysm, given an item with haste versus one with crit your spreadsheet might still tell you the haste item will provide more of an upgrade. But hopefully it won't be such an upgrade that the decision becomes a no-brainer. Hopefully the other stats on the item will come into play more. It's too easy currently to focus on The Best Stat to the exclusion of all else. (I'm not talking about stats such as spell power, attack power or Strength, because for most of your pieces, those just scale with item level. I'm talking about the secondary stats where the real gearing decisions come from.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23042454607-cata-changes-with-itemization.html))<br />
<br />
Overhealing and mana pools in Cataclysm<br />
That's a relative softball question, because the problem is healers overheal by so much now *and* can get away with it. If you actually care about your mana pool, then regen (Spirit in Cataclysm) matters. If you actually care about mana, then getting bigger heals (such as getting crits) matters too.<br />
<br />
Now imagine that as a druid, your mastery stat does something interesting to your hots. It has to be *interesting* or it's just going to mimic the effects of spell power (Int in Cataclysm). Let's say mastery increased the duration of your Rejuv, but did so without reducing the healing per tick. Now Mastery helps throughput, but doesn't help burst healing as much as crit. If haste also affects how often your hots tick, then you might get some interesting gameplay out of playing off of longer hots that tick more frequently. If you don't need to spam heals as much as you do today, then reducing cast time through haste isn't as important to a healer, though it still might be desirable. Now you can make interesting (we hope) choices about whether you want more crit, more haste, more mastery or more spirit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23042454607-cata-changes-with-itemization.html))<br />
<br />
Itemization and power growth<br />
Yeah, exponential power growth is just part of the design. It doesn't really bother us that the delta between character level and item level keeps growing. It might be a problem someday if it takes scientific notation to express how much Agility there is on your breastplate.<br />
<br />
The problem folks are referring to for this expansion is that we based combat ratings, especially things like crit and hit, off of one assumption for what gear would look like in 4.3, but adding the hard modes meant that the gear ended up having more stats than we thought. If we ended up squeezing in additional tiers into Cataclysm the same thing would happen, though we also have some ideas to make the scaling work better in general.

We should down lk this week now and then we will be able to do Hard putricide for our first week of heroic attempts as that has been the easiest tier boss for us and if it doesnt work out we just go clear the wing bosses and do not have to worry about how many attempts we have left and a bad couple of dcs or a sindragosa+rimefang bug we had tonight affecting our ability to clear on normal.</div></div><hr />

What else do you expect ?<br />
<br />
On my realm 25 man pugs usually breeze past the first 4, and some have been known to get princes down. It just gives them now 3456789 attempts on Blood-Queen.<br />
<br />
Expect more nerfs to ICC mechanics and buffs to the raid buff when more and more pugs steal our instance ID's :&lt;</div></div><hr />

It makes perfect sense to take away the limited tries for normal modes. If you want to show how good and how hard ICC is, play heroic mode, I still think it will take the majority of guilds a while to actually get the grasps of a fight and down the bosses on normal mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More attempts won't make your DPS increase, won't make your raid members actually switch targets when you tell them to switch targets. Won't make them move away from things or not stand in fire/ooze/ice blast. This isn't going to get the bad random pugs any farther in ICC. <br />
<br />
....the enormous 30% damage/health/healing buff on the other hand might do that but I'll save that rant for when the buff goes in<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the buffs to Toravon are, in my opinion, are absolutely unwarranted. My guild walked in there and downed him in one attempt. I get into a random pug and they wipe over and over and over because they stand in the ice orbs, never switch targets, still do MAYBE 3-4k DPS on average in T9 gear....I don't know, Blizzard is doing the same thing that the Board of Education did to the teachers of the nation: Not good enough and failing the basic standard tests?

at least now we can try some new stuff : &quot;what if you tanked it there?&quot; &quot;what if we swapped a healer for a dps?&quot;.<br />

Imagine Ulduar HM's with that system. Even Thorim requires a lot of wipes.<br />
Its not like &quot;Thanks God, now the guilds which dont raid 20 hours a day can be successful&quot;. Its all about alt raids now.<br />

<br />
at least now we can try some new stuff : &quot;what if you tanked it there?&quot; &quot;what if we swapped a healer for a dps?&quot;.<br />
<br />
And world firsts being done by guilds whose players have 3 alts so they can 'practice' is just stupid. Increase the difficulty of the encounters instead, I've always hated artificial blocks.<br />
<br />
good change.<br />
<br />
<br />
And what would you change at putricide? He is one of the most simple encounters ever.<br />
The whole strategy consists of kill boss &gt; kill green thing &gt; move &gt; kill bos &gt; kill orange thing &gt; move &gt; repeat<br />
The only other things you have to watch out for are vials and slimepools. In phase 3 you have the slime and the taunting added but the rest of the mechanics removed.<br />
<br />
Same with blood queen really, theres only 4 things to the whole fight; move to eachother when you have a link, move along the wall when you have swarming shadows, biting (which is a compelte joke if your dps is any good, ou can kill her with a fair amount of people unbitten) and moving away from eachother in p2.<br />

If you are still consuming tries on these bosses now, then you aren't even worth hardmodes tbh.</div></div><hr />

Dude, just because you and your guild managed to down it doesnt give you the right to be a fucking elitist douche here. Those boss are still hard for 90% of raiders out there, even in normal mode.</div></div><hr />

so keep in mind every holiday is different - I know a 36-yr old family man, who plays in my guild about 6hrs a week - and he's really keen for &quot;The Love Fool&quot; title, despite never having wanted any of the others. Does that therefore mean that he shouldn't have access to this one? Don't think that every player has the same knowledge, or playstyle, that you do.<br />
<br />
ALSO - it's perfectly possible that on some versions of the game (say, French for instance, or German translation) that the perfume/cologne is missing that tag.</div></div><hr />

But the guys on that thread are (at least wannabe) hardcore min-maxing raiders, who stocked up on those perfumes on the first two days of the event. Those guys should have at least a basic knowledge of the game.<br />
You misunderstand me, I'm not saying casuals shouldn't have access, especially if they care about the event, I said that wannabe-pros don't deserve them.<br />

<br />
I fail to see how this makes it any easier for guilds who failed to even kill Putricide within 20 tries, as if giving them the opportunity to wipe even more on a boss they have struggled to down for the past 5 weeks will help morale? Ofc it won't. So they extend the lockout? Less gear upgrade options. <br />
<br />
No more limited tries is a win in my book, we've got 13 goes on Sindragosa....and next week we'll be wiping on the Lich king until we're blue in the face...for about a week, or until ppl give up and go home.<br />
<br />
On a side note the amount of tries we've wasted due to impossible lag conditions, if anything should be nerfed, nerf that please!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There is no elitism there, if Blizzard is removing those because they're saying enough guilds cleared the place it's because there are more way more than 10% only.<br />
<br />
The nerf to Toravon... after 1 week... lol... VoA is the pinnacle of &quot;I pay, I wanna&quot; moto... sad. They alread removed the chest pieces (and only 3 drops instead of the usual 4 from 25man) because VoA is easy... guess it's time to drop only T10 gloves now to keep the &quot;challenge&quot; in line right? Ops, that is against the &quot;I've payed for it!&quot; rules...<br />
<br />
The only real good thing from the normal attempts removal is for people trying Shadowmourne. The infusion quests can really screw some attempts and some guilds are lazy enough to not try it because &quot;it's a waste of attempts and we'll only try that later&quot;. Also by doing that, they can ensure a chance for the ones collecting the shards, since you can try and save the last attempt to kill it on normal, not wasting 4 possible shards.</div></div><hr />

I find that the bosses aren't really hard them-self, it's the players that make it look hard in there play. Not attacking anyone just something I found, but once you get a strat down that everyone understand then the bosses get easy, it's just a team role!<br />
<br />
About the removal of the attempts on normal, I don't know if I should be happy or pissed, I liked this because it pushed players to be at there best, now they can relax because there's not more limit!<br />

Haha, easy to turn that one around.<br />
Just because you are in the minority that finds these bosses hard doesn't mean 90% of the raiders finds them hard.<br />
Theres 6509 registered 10man putricide kills on wowprogress, i would call that a lot more than 10% of the guilds, so stop pulling numbers out of your arse.<br />
As people said before, the only thing that might have added even the slightest challenge to bosses like putricide and blood queen, was the limited attempts. Now they removed them, those bosses are even more of a joke than they already were before, and that is totally sad for an endtier raid. <br />
Ofcourse theres hardmodes to be more challenging, but that doesn't mean the normal mode bosses have to be so easy that a pug can walk in there and roflstomp their way up to the lich king without any tactics.</div></div><hr />

I have not killed the lich king that is correct. That is good. Faceroll content is fail. And I have cleared the frost wing O_o?

This made me lol. Its been the first week and already the casuals come out of the closet. My guild may not have downed all the bosses with limited attempts yet, but I'd rather have them there because when you get a limited number of attempts the amount of people not paying attention goes from like 50% to maybe 10% and we usually do a lot better. Its the second week since Lich King has been available, not having Putricide down means you should just quit attempting him cause he won't go anywhere til you get full 264 gear obviously. Also, think back to SWP times, there was hardly as much QQ about how hard those bosses were and the only reason M'uru got nerfed is cause he was too hard (when only 2 guilds in the world could get him down by pure RNG) he had to be tweaked a little but beyond that until 3.0 came they didn't nerf SWP (or BT/Hyjal/TK for that matter). I still remember casuals doing T4 content all BC, and a boss or two of T5 content because there was a real difference between the tier levels. Now it all just flows and having full 245 outgears normal ICC like its dumb. WTB BC/Vanilla style progression (make HM the normal mode and GG).</div></div><hr />

How the hell is the last fight in Wotlk regardless whether it is normal or not suppose to be faceroll?<br />
<br />
<br />
Disagree with this.<br />
<br />
Why are people moaning about more and more guilds being able to kill LK on normal?<br />
<br />
IT IS NORMAL MODE!!!<br />
<br />
It is not hardest content in the game. <br />
<br />
When all of these whining little babies actually clear normal mode and then get to the hard modes, they will /care about how easy or hard the normal modes are.<br />
<br />
The people that whine about normal modes being accessible to many are the people that want to feel elite (but really are not).</div></div><hr />

I always knew Blizz would remove limited attempts in the normal mode so that casuals could see Arthas, I didn't however think it would be two weeks after he was released. Way to soon in my opinion but what can you do, Blizz is in it for the money (and they are quite successful at it by the way) and the way they do that is by catering to the highest player base, which is unfortunately the casuals. <br />
<br />
Hopefully they add a different title or something along those lines for a Heroic LK kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whine all you want about &quot;QQ CASUAL&quot; but in general, the turn towards casuals is much better for the game. I used to wipe on M'uru just like all you &quot;hardcores&quot; and frankly, it was frustrating. I wasn't satisfied when we finally killed him...I was just relieved we were done with it.<br />
<br />
I love raiding, but I don't want it to take over my life. I'm in High School, I play sports, I go to parties, etc. I don't have time to wipe on one boss for 5 hours a night every night. I will agree that ToC was TOO casual, but making Icecrown impossible for PuGs would just be a step in the wrong direction. Putricide, Lana'thel, etc. are all too tough of a fight for PuGs anyway, why put in limited attempts? It just makes guilds frustrated. <br />
<br />
The number one guild on my server was set to do Lich King-25 last night, but because one of their healers ragequit the guild because he messed up one too many times, they logged in to find that he had burned all 16 attempts while they were gone. Limited attempts aren't a constructive way to make content challenging, designing hard content is. <br />
<br />
On a side note, I really like those new mounts, here's to hoping they're obtainable sometime soon.</div></div><hr />

no im just sick of hearing raiders, who make us like 1% of allllllllll the raiders (anyone who does any raid) CRY and 99% of others wont even see the lich king die. Your in a elite group of like 100,000 people, where the elite of the elite are those who have downed lk25 already. I mean i do qualify as we'll be finishing our attempts on the lich king tonight and 15 minute fights.....yeah, it took us 4 minutes to get him sub 80% so prepare to learn mana-management and a good hard fight again.<br />
<br />
<br />
btw....the contents easy enough, we dont ptr and killed sindragosa with only 7 pulls btw.</div></div><hr />

Theres still a ton of people that havent seen yogg 10 or 25 man yet and thats two tiers back.<br />
So anyway /gratz to the casuals that still wipe at Put and Blood wing maybe now you guys can get somewhere.<br />

its not just that its the fact that Blizzard is now hand feeding people content and gear like they are 2 year olds. all I'm saying is it would of been better to wait a week or so until they did the unlimited attempts for ICC.<br />

We set our tries for monday this week as tues wed were terrible for lag and 17 attempts do not take that long to do we go work on it for a bit like new bosses tend to do the pull in is causing random dcs( hi thorims room and maly) to those with bad comps. After about 5 attempts we go try the shadowmourne quest one more time on putricide then give up on it and one shot and take our 5 min smoke break.<br />
<br />
We come back to respawns and rimefang and sindragosa being linked on thier pull, wipe to this trying every concievable way to pull rimefang but sindragosa still pulls everytime. gg skill of attempts right there. And this was 2 weeks after losing attempts on bloodqueen due to her aggroing on bloodprinces. And of course they dont refund attempts for bugged fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a whole, i haven't got an issue with that, as long as the heroic modes are a challenge, its all good. Personally my guild is a 10man only guild, we raid a limited amount of time per week and we stop dead on the time raid is meant to end, close to kill or not. we've got solid players and so far there hasn't been a boss we've struggled with yet, its only been time that's hindered us and id imagine for solid guilds with plenty of time the'll have lich down already/next week easily<br />
<br />
But yeah times have changed, the structure of raiding has changed, as long as they don't nerf heroic versions to the ground i see no issue with this. The only thing i could say what is slightly retarded is the title issue &quot;the kingslayer&quot;, personaly i think that should only be rewarded for heroic versions, for the simple fact that when a title is owned by the majority, it looses its uniqueness, go figure</div></div><hr />

<br />
Forgetting the Ensidia farce a minute (Im sure Blizz &amp; Ensidia would do things differently given the chance).<br />
Blizz could have gloated over a perfect week.<br />
<br />
They even offered to re work his drops because people were a little underwhelmed with the itemisation, Blizz you had gotten it 110% perfect.<br />
<br />
An expansion end boss with little to no bugs, and a content player base because.....<br />
<br />
<br />
The bleeding edge guilds got him in first week, under a 100, the cutting edge guilds enjoyed phase 1 and we were looking forward to Defile and Valks next reset, the mass ranks of guilds excited at nailing Sindragosa this coming reset with a view to seeing what all the fuss was about atop the spire of the Ice citadel, only leaving the pug &amp; scrub, who were happy to wait for the Kingslayer alts and eventual zone wide buffs/debuffs to aid them through to the King.<br />
<br />
You could make a strong arguement that the whole player base was content with the first week of the King, but alas not Blizzard, this removal of tries will leave a majority in the position of battering him next week until he is dead.<br />
<br />
I for one was so happy that we had phases and work to do to get him, I am sure this coming reset will lead to wipes until dead.<br />
<br />
I dont know how to put a number on it, but you just shortened the life of WotLK by a massive amount, you may say hard modes, but I say schmodes, hard modes are about better peens, if the King is dead, the King is dead.<br />
<br />
I must be missing something or you have a 3.3. Frostwell Plateau up your sleeves.<br />

<br />
Why are people moaning about more and more guilds being able to kill LK on normal?<br />
<br />
IT IS NORMAL MODE!!!<br />
<br />
It is not hardest content in the game. <br />
<br />
When all of these whining little babies actually clear normal mode and then get to the hard modes, they will /care about how easy or hard the normal modes are.<br />
<br />
The people that whine about normal modes being accessible to many are the people that want to feel elite (but really are not).<br />
<br />
This really made me miss the TBC days. I've no problem with more casual players killing bosses, but having a 'normal mode' and 'hard mode' for everything just makes me feel sick. IMO it was much better when killing the boss at all was the main challenge for everyone, not &quot;kill him while wearing a pink dress and /dance emoting after every 3rd spell you cast&quot; achievements were seen as the most challenging content.<br />
<br />
I know I'm the minority, and I accept that, it doesn't mean I don't miss wiping in BT before the 3.lol nerf. :(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aoyi</div><div class="date">2010-02-09, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree in that most people who post on these topics only do so to pretend that these changes effected them. That they &quot;would have had LK down&quot; next week anyway, but now it won't mean anything because Blizzard went all casual. Meanwhile, they have no signature in their names for people to see they've only cleared up to Saurfang, that they haven't cleared Ulduar or that they live only through the achievements of others. <br />
<br />
Who cares that Ensidia, Paragon, Vodka and whoever cleared Icecrown? Did you? No? Then stop whining. Blizzard just helped YOU too. I personally haven't downed LK yet. I'm ok with that, because I know I will. I'm in the process of getting a solid raid group together. One that doesn't have a healer or tank drop 2 hours in because they didn't realize it would take so long. If it takes me 2 weeks to get him or a month, fine. Cataclysm is a while from now. Enjoy the game you pay for. No you really aren't as hardcore as you think. Just take a moment, relax, and finish what you have in front of you before you complain that other people were able to.</div></div><hr />

Since the start of this ridiculous gating system we have lost COUNTLESS attempts to nothing more than Blizzard's lag ridden servers which insist on disconnecting people at the most inopportune moments. You want to put in limited attempts? That's perfectly fine, but make sure people actually get to use all those attempts. So far about 30% of our wipes have been to disconnects/crashes. That is infuriating. Unfortunately, this will inevitably spill over into heroic content. At least we can finish normal at our &quot;slower than we are capable of due to technical difficulties&quot; pace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you haven't succed before, you fail, that's all. Ppl that succed will be able to link their acheivement to prove they were able to kill it in the first week when they had limited attempt<br />
<br />
<br />
The major problem of all of the QQer here is that they put too much Self-esteem on how well they succed on wow. When they wake up and they realize that thousand of ppl will be able to do the same. Their epeen shrink dramatically. <br />
<br />
Basing your self esteem on your performance in a game is the ideal way to wake up at 50 and realize you are a total fail in your life.<br />
<br />
but that is my opinion.<br />
<br />
There is other game that are more elitist or hardcore gamer oriented, why you don't just cancel your subcribtion and switch game?<br />
<br />
Probably because you love WoW. And after that, Blizzard dont want anymore to release content for 1% of the player base.<br />
<br />
for frostgalon. It was hard???? lol, algalon is probably the hardest in the instance anyway because you get a bunch of retared pvper who dont know how to raid that doesn't switch because anyway they dont read emote or dont have deadly boss mod installed.<br />
<br />
lol<br />
and by the way, this is only free loot if your gear drop. i never managed to get a pve piece there for any of my toon :(<br />

The Toravon nerfs are ridiculous, though. We easily 1-shot him on 25-man already. He drops T-10 gear and is arguably even easier than Marrowgar in his initial incarnation.</div></div><hr />

So what if you think the content is easy. <br />
<br />
There are still hardmode versions and since ICC was harder than ToC I guess that the hardmode will be harder than ToC hardmode aswell. Stop whining about letting other people be able to see the content. <br />
<br />
I'm guessing you want to brag about &quot;I've killed Lich King&quot; without adding &quot;hardmode&quot; to it. <br />

My guild may not have downed all the bosses with limited attempts yet, but I'd rather have them there because when you get a limited number of attempts the amount of people not paying attention goes from like 50% to maybe 10% and we usually do a lot better. Its the second week since Lich King has been available, not having Putricide down means you should just quit attempting him cause he won't go anywhere til you get full 264 gear obviously. Also, think back to SWP times, there was hardly as much QQ about how hard those bosses were and the only reason M'uru got nerfed is cause he was too hard (when only 2 guilds in the world could get him down by pure RNG) he had to be tweaked a little but beyond that until 3.0 came they didn't nerf SWP (or BT/Hyjal/TK for that matter). I still remember casuals doing T4 content all BC, and a boss or two of T5 content because there was a real difference between the tier levels. Now it all just flows and having full 245 outgears normal ICC like its dumb. WTB BC/Vanilla style progression (make HM the normal mode and GG).<br />
<br />
&lt;3<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note I don't mind the attempts been removed, we worked on sindra with 4 attempts remaining in 25man and had her at like 20% so that extra would have helped, but they will also be introducing a buff like 30% on stats or something similar which combined with no attempts limit is just overkill beyond sense because there are so so many that can barely scratch the non limited attempt bosses after or including saurfang, when you think it is the final closing raiding tier of WOTLK and after the shit fest TOC that we were stuck with it just makes you go what is the point anymore (and don't say do hard modes -_- raiding should be raiding and not a pathetic joke like 5mans)</div></div><hr />

Removal of the limited tries to help with all the lag/dc's is probably a good thing. Immediate nerfs to anything in VoA is just plain silly. It's catering to the NAO! crowd at a ridiculous level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I was refering people that wanted preTBC stuff. It was like, 0.2% of the entire playerbase who reached a high level in Sunwell and I dont think that blizzard are creating so much for just those 0.2%. <br />
<br />
The other 99.8% can try and try and never get anywhere. They want to see the content though, and they dont want to raid every day which you basically did back then (Farmed on the day for stuff and raided on the night). <br />
<br />
You have to put some time into raiding if you want to come somewhere, but you cant call the four first bosses not putting time into it, since they arent as easy as toc25 was back then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The word nerf was not there in physical form, however I will assume that the announcement of the limited attempt removal is what led to the mention about &quot;next they'll be nerfing Sindragosa and Lich Kings, then heroic modes&quot;. Or it could have been the &quot;Grats casuals&quot;. If that wasn't the intent, then I apologize for any type of offense.<br />
<br />
I'll say it again, I'm pretty sure 95% of the people blaming Blizzard and &quot;casuals&quot; for the limited attempt removal had forgotten that the idea of limited attempts in normal mode was met with feelings of confusion and dislike. So again, why are people complaining about a feature being removed that no one liked at all to begin with?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heroic difficulty was something that was supposed to be put in to all raid scenarios. I, for one, remember Blizzard stating that old content was going to have heroic difficulties. Yes rehashing old content blah blah blahhh, but I think this was a great idea. I would love to go back to molten core with my current guild and tackle that dungeon again in a heroic difficulty for equal rewards. <br />
<br />
And regarding the argument for everyone being able to see content... come on. It hasn't even been a month yet. Are people really itching to quit so bad just because they can't see the end of the content in just two weeks? This is just retarded and goes against the philosophy of video games as a whole. If you want to see all of what something has to offer without putting any work in to it at all... I believe everyone at least has enough common sense to go to a video store and rent a fucking movie, because that's what things are turning in to. Less thought, less effort, less actual GAMING. Video games are slowly turning in to just interactive movies and it's sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also Heroic and Normal mode.... You got to kind of look at it as a way for blizzard to make the game enjoyable to all players that buy the game. It is sort of like any other console game. You get to pick the mode of difficulty that fits your play style. So it would be like blizzard puts up a screen that says<br />
Pick your difficulty<br />
1. Easy Mode: Normal with Buff<br />
2. Medium Mode: Normal with out buff<br />
3. Hard Mode: Heroic<br />
<br />
Not everyone in the world can do 3, and why should people continue to play a game and not be able to complete it after paying the same amount that everyone else is paying to play. They give you options for a reason and that is to make the game to fit everyone’s play style.<br />
<br />
Also look at Diablo 1, and 2. There were modes in that, right? The harder mode you picked the better the stuff you gain from the game. You get purples instead of greens from the last boss lol....</div></div><hr />

Like I said above, watch a movie if you think paying is all that you need to do in order to see the end of something. This is a game. There are supposed to be difficult obstacles to overcome. Not a series of wide-open doors that you just walk through.</div></div><hr />

Just because you are in the minority that finds these bosses hard doesn't mean 90% of the raiders finds them hard.<br />
Theres 6509 registered 10man putricide kills on wowprogress, i would call that a lot more than 10% of the guilds, so stop pulling numbers out of your arse.<br />
As people said before, the only thing that might have added even the slightest challenge to bosses like putricide and blood queen, was the limited attempts. Now they removed them, those bosses are even more of a joke than they already were before, and that is totally sad for an endtier raid. <br />
Ofcourse theres hardmodes to be more challenging, but that doesn't mean the normal mode bosses have to be so easy that a pug can walk in there and roflstomp their way up to the lich king without any tactics.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If the bosses were easy for you, and easy for many others, then what business do you have complaining about it?<br />
<br />
You were unaffected by it before the change.<br />
<br />
You'll remain unaffected by it after the change.<br />
<br />
If you just need a hug and a shoulder to cry on, call a friend. Your logic is absolutely retarded and completely legacy, and there's an entire expansion with 3 content patches that has clearly stated Blizzard's intentions.<br />
<br />
If you don't like the game because it doesn't challenge you, don't let the door hit you where the good Lord split you.<br />
<br />
I am a casual player. I'll never have &quot;Heroic&quot; ICC gear, so no need to worry as you sit in Orgrimmar in your awesome gear watching people /inspect you as you stroke away at it. Your achievements are still better than mine will ever be, as is your gear and your Guild. Blizzards design intention this entire expansion has been hell-bent on making sure people like me get to see the content that cost an ungodly amount of money to design, develop and troubleshoot. <br />
<br />
Again, though... Don't you worry your little panties off. You won't ever see &quot;scrubs&quot; like me stealing your Hard-Mode glory. :)</div></div><hr />

I'm not exactly grasping your sarcasm but I'll do my best with this one.<br />

In my perspective, easy mode is for people who find normal and hard mode to be too difficult. I don't understand why people even want to play a game if they are just going to do it thoughtless/effortlessly. It's like having to mash your DVD remote for a couple hours instead of just hitting the play button. Pointless.</div></div><hr />

I mean seriously what the hell? People just can't be happy with anything and always have to bitch about something.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You dont usually see the &quot;hardcores&quot; posting &quot;qq's&quot; on the forums until after casuals ruin the game just a bit more every single time anything happens at all. And even then its not the truly hardcore that are posting about it.<br />
<br />
I think its wonderful that blizzard changed the game to be better for casual players in TBC and have made it better for them over time. However the constant nerfs after already implementing encounters that should be easy enough to any casual guild with actual good players and not idiots that afk or die in the first 10 seconds of every pull has gotten beyond ridiculous. Most nerfs are not even done to the bosses/content that could actually use them. For some reason this team of blizzards just nerfs every single freakin thing, apparently they cant nerf one encounter without having to nerf everything else in the game.<br />
<br />
My guild tries to compete in the new content every time its released thinking that normal modes are gonna be some amazing thing for our recruitment. Honestly only noobs will think the completion of normal modes is a reason to apply to a guild.<br />
I love my guild this attitude just drives me nuts. We are not a competing guild, simple as that, i wish we'd stop trying to act like we were.<br />
Point is my guild is casual, we raid 9 hours a week and theres no reason we couldnt at least get to the lich king if enough people cared enough to play better. <br />
Im a hardcore player at heart tho, and many of my guildies are also so we try to get 10s together in even more limited time available to use than the 25s.<br />
We know the difference between a casual guild like ours that needs every single attempt on the new bosses and a hardcore guild that doesnt.<br />
We know theres players in our raid that dont open their damn eyes and do their stupid easy job. We know the fights are tuned well enough for a casual player if he wasnt a bad player. We also can tell when an encounter can use maybe a slight nerf.<br />
But ever since TBC this game has gotten worse and worse as far as the ease of the actual content. Hard modes kind of save it, i definitely love the hard modes, but if you arent doing them and you had been playing this game from the start youd be pretty damn bored right now.<br />
<br />
I get why new players would think this game is so incredible right now, it is, its a ton of fun. But playing it for 5 years and seeing it just plummet downhill over the past 2...<br />
<br />
The sad thing about all this is the easier the content gets the worse the players get so the content has to be made easier again and then the players get worse again and that just repeats.<br />
I thought ICC had a great balance so far, but when the nerfs come its gonna be worse than ToC, just cooler looking.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zain890</div><div class="date">2010-02-09, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently everyone here has perfect connections and raiders who's WoW clients never crash. Since the start of this ridiculous gating system we have lost COUNTLESS attempts to nothing more than Blizzard's lag ridden servers which insist on disconnecting people at the most inopportune moments. You want to put in limited attempts? That's perfectly fine, but make sure people actually get to use all those attempts. So far about 30% of our wipes have been to disconnects/crashes. That is infuriating. Unfortunately, this will inevitably spill over into heroic content. At least we can finish normal at our &quot;slower than we are capable of due to technical difficulties&quot; pace.<br />
<br />
<br />
QFT. Every time you pull The Lick King and a DPS, Healer, or Tank DCs, it's pretty certain there's going to be a wipe, depending on what part of the fight you are on. This scenario has been true for every single gating boss out there, except on 25 there's slightly more slack.<br />
<br />
If you still want to haze about removing attempts on normal, use your brain. &quot;Heroic Mode will still have attempts.&quot; If I were you, I really wouldn't be QQ'ing about how more people are going to kill The Lich King, or any other boss for that matter. I prefer a boss where we get infinite tries on a very very hard boss (Insert m'uru guild-breaking difficulty boss here) than any boss with limited attempts, that you lose because your sever lags to hell, or people randomly DC on really really good pulls. <br />
<br />
The attempt-style lockout is a very stupid one, until blizzard gets perfect servers, and people get perfect ISPs. That's an opinion that I'm sure myself, and hundreds of thousands of other people hold.</div></div><hr />

TBO there was no sarcasm involved in my comment. I am not saying that playing a game on easy the best way to go. I am stating that some people can't grasp on to things as well as others. I perfer to have a bit of challenge my self but at the same time i feel for the people that can't grasp very well and still pay to play this game, and or get stuck with friends that are idiots and can't seem to grasp on the fights as easy as you or i do. So all in all i think that having different levels of challenges is a great idea and it give blizzard profits and maybe JUST maybe these people need baby steps in order to get good at content.<br />
Hense why i said give thoughs people #1 which was easy mode...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone going on and on about removing limited attempts makes me giggle. It's just regular mode so it isn't the most difficult thing out there. It doesn't assure that all guilds and pugs will down certain encounters because it doesn't affect the difficulty of them. If a group can't get past certain bosses it's due to people that can't learn to do things after being told time and time again. I'll admit that I wouldn't want to wipe on the same boss 12 times in a row and I'm not alone when I say that. People grow irritated with things and give up after failing for so long, so taking away limited attempts still leaves a sort of &quot;invisable&quot; barrier by leaving people to deal with their own personal breaking point. Sorry I fail at explaining...I think an easier way to put it is that everyone has their limits. <br />
<br />
Pretty off topic now, but since guilds have dominated ICC and pugs can down many bosses with ease, it reminded me of a person that I know in game said that he didn't believe that ICC is going to be the last raid in Wrath. His reasoning was on the point of how Black Temple was supposedly the end of BC, but then ZA and Sunwell came out afterwards. What do you guys think? Do you believe that a new raid is plausible?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering that a lot of online vendors already have pre-release dates for the next expansion I find it unlikely, but I think it would be great if we had another dungeon to look forward to. If there was one, I'd want it to be a different structure than the others. Somewhere between the structure of ToC and ICC, but epic on the scale of molten core. I love a dungeon that's filled with nothing but menacing, gigantic, devastating mobs like in MC. I felt accomplished even after just downing a core hound back in the day. I'd like some of those moments back.</div></div><hr />

I have no desire or need to gain any sort of gratification on a forum. I'm merely calling out your statements as being absolutely ludicrous. <br />
<br />
There is no &quot;stretching&quot; involved. Claiming that players get worse as encounters get easier blankets the entire player base. By excluding excellent players from that statement, you kill the statement altogether. <br />
<br />
I mean, really...? At this point in the expansion, does every &quot;Encounter Nerfed&quot; post have to be met with 10+ pages of people claiming WoW is on it's last leg, catering to casuals, etc?<br />

<br />
Very much agree with you here.. <br />
It's been like a game design philosophy to provide the players with several difficulties. <br />
Easy - Normal - Hard, from nintendo untill PS3/xbox360.. <br />
so, at the moment blizzard is only implementing the concept.. <br />
<br />
in other words (in WoW terms =p)<br />
Normal Mode - PuGs, casual guilds, player who likes to raid, people who would like to see the content<br />
<br />
Hard Mode - Hardcore player, players who like challenge, Guild-based players (players who like to finish the content as a guild)</div></div><hr />

Yes, and it will never, ever, end, no matter what you or anyone else says or does. The only course of action is to ignore it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no &quot;stretching&quot; involved. Claiming that players get worse as encounters get easier blankets the entire player base. By excluding excellent players from that statement, you kill the statement altogether. <br />
<br />
I mean, really...? At this point in the expansion, does every &quot;Encounter Nerfed&quot; post have to be met with 10+ pages of people claiming WoW is on it's last leg, catering to casuals, etc?<br />
<br />
It's just old. Stop it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hi stupid. I believe we should understand each other since we're both idiots, you especially.<br />
<br />
The point is that the game has been repeatedly made easier and easier allowing newer players to be terrible and get away with crying nerf some more. Not that as the game gets easier you get worse as a player. <br />
<br />
You must be one of the newer players and dont have a damn clue thats why youre even arguing it in such a ridiculous manner.<br />
<br />
Also i personally never said anything about a &quot;last leg&quot; or any such thing. I still enjoy the game in general (which i also mentioned) but overall its gotten worse and worse and i wouldnt be surprised if it ends up like DDO. <br />
The downhill spiral started in TBC, its been 2 years of getting worse and worse and im still playing, that doesnt change the fact that it has indeed gottten worse.</div></div><hr />

I really enjoyed how they did limited attempts this time around, it gave you enough to practice and get the kill but not too many that you were spending 10+ hours a week on one stupid boss where one stupid person can and does screw up every single attempt because they just don't care anymore.<br />
<br />
A low limited attempt system keeps people focused and makes for a steady and organized progression where people are actually ENJOYING themselves. I know being overworked is more of a guild problem, but it will certainly not be an uncommon occurrence anymore, and I will miss the limited attempts system, even if it would have been the only thing preventing us from reaching hard modes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, you are a worse player now than you were last expansion?<br />
I wouldn't say that, but I would say that the players who have only raided in WotLK are worse than the players who started raiding in TBC (like myself) in general terms. It also follows that TBC raiders are, probably, worse raiders than vanilla raiders (besides the standard 15 afkers that were in most raids back then).</div></div><hr />

Thats a great point. <br />
I suppose when a games taken over by so many absolutely terrible players its just time to move on.<br />
You are right, i am sorry.<br />
Doesnt mean i wont be upset when what was a great game gets turned into crap.<br />
Dont get me wrong this game is still fun, just keeps goin downhill is all.<br />
<br />
It just amazes me that ICC came out and was greatly balanced but theres so many bad players the content has to be changed to fallover and die mode. Thats how its been since TBC too. Remember heroics? old hillsbrad and black morass, arcactraz, those were basically the only 3 in TBC that needed nerfs, yet they nerfed the living crap out of every single instance and have done the same to every piece of content ever since.<br />
Its really ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Just to clarify, in case you, or someone else, misunderstood me: I don't like that this is what the game has come to. It's just what blizzard has allowed the game to become.<br />

I have no problem with casual or hardcore players, only extremely bad ones (things like mages who only melee or people who stand in the fire on Shade of Aran for 4 consecutive months... we all know at least 1).</div></div><hr />

I agree with you completely, but I'd find it difficult to distinguish which of them are better players naturally and which of them are better players because of their tenure. <br />
<br />
I personally saw the Limited Attempt mechanic to be the Hard-Mode when no Hard-Mode was available. It seemed like an inescapable separation between the good and the great. <br />
<br />
Now that real Hard-Modes are available, why keep the restraint? What does some casual Guild banging their head against Putricide or BQL have to do with your progression through Hard Modes?<br />
<br />
I suppose if the Hard-Modes are too easy, then the complaints make a lot of sense. As a casual player, I'm very glad I can fit WoW Raiding into my already-tight real life schedule. I also like the fact that they've made a way for people who have more time to commit the ability to reach content/gear/titles exclusive to the very best, because as much as I know I'll never be downing HM Lich King, it leaves the game &quot;incomplete&quot; for me and keeps me logging in and fuels my desire to improve my character.</div></div><hr />

Rolling a DK is enough, same with Warlocks and Paladins. No reason to share those with other classes. Race mounts =/= Class mounts (for the few that have them).</div></div><hr />

Wait a second. Since what you said was totally besides the point are you hinting that people that want easier content so they can &quot;enjoy it and see it&quot; is actually &quot;we just want free loot so we can dps better&quot;?<br />

Honestly, by the last few posts you've made -- the only person that's &quot;crying&quot; and &quot;bitching&quot; is you.<br />
<br />
Certain classes having unique features is something cool about the game, people already share enough armor sets -- last thing ya want is everyone on the same mounts.<br />

Okay, I'll say it again, in small words this time.<br />
<br />
Having a particular mount does not make your character do any better tanking, healing or dps. It does not mean you will be better at pve or pvp. Therefore, there is no need to share them among everybody.<br />
Racial mounts are fine to share, providing you have the reputation for them, but class mounts have always been held as one of the 'unique' things about certain classes, just like hunter / warlock pets. I see no reason to ever share these among everybody.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Saying everyone has their own unique version of something is defining the word special.<br />
<br />
Unique (http://thesaurus.reference.com/browse/unique)... In the middle of the list there's... special. <br />
<br />
And Special (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/special)..<br />
In addtion to your understanding of the word...<br />
<br />
7.	being such in an exceptional degree; particularly valued: a special friend.<br />
<br />
Special/unique also means<br />
<br />
1.	of a distinct or particular kind or character: a special kind of key.<br />
3.	pertaining or peculiar to a particular person, thing, instance, etc.; distinctive; unique: the special features of a plan.<br />
<br />

Not so much because it makes it easier, the fights are still hard enough for the vast majority of players. The problem with limited attempts is simple, server lag. I play on Medivh, which is extremely notorious for server lag. Nothing like blowing an attempt because you start lagging halfway through the fight. For those who aren't on servers like mine, server lag is inevitable and not something that users can fix or even predict. We have made our peace, and have just learned to deal with it. But when they introduce something that is entirely dependent on no lag, it's frustrating as hell to blow attempts just because the server started lagging. <br />
<br />
The whole reason for the limited attempts was to slow high end guilds down. The problem was all the elitist guilds used alts to artificially inflate the number of attempts completely bypassing the entire purpose of the attempts system. It really wasn't thought out very well, because the idea of practicing with alts first is blatantly obvious.</div></div><hr />

Entirely off topic, but oh so legendary in it's own right.<br />
<br />
From back in the day's of the BC beta;<br />
<br />
Workhorse - Summon a flying mount to come to the warrior's aid<br />
<br />
Instant cast, 350mana, works only in outlands<br />
<br />
Learned lvl 66, 100% speed <br />
<br />
Where am I gonna get 350 mana?<br />
<br />
And how can a Workhorse fly?*<br />
<br />
More on topic, i agree that these new models are probably for faction specific DK's. I always wondered why they looked the same to begin with, especially since there were alternate versions with different colors back in the WotLK beta. If these are implemented as such, it's going to be one of those &quot;about time&quot; moments for blizzard.<br />

<br />
I'm just assuming the new deathcharger mounts will be alliance and horde DK mounts, with Archerus being replaced after you ally with your old faction. (I.E. You use Archerus Charger while in the starting zone, and after completing the quest you turn into Thrall/Varian, you gain the Azure/Crimson Charger, (Blue/Red), based on faction)<br />
<br />
To be completely honest, I wouldn't doubt they'd create new warlock mount skins. Not faction specific, but possibly race specific, as not all of the warlocks became warlocks the same way, lore wise.</div></div><hr />

If that was directed at me, I was not saying it was unique. I was simply saying that going the way they are in Cataclysm, I wouldn't doubt they'd add new skins in Cataclysm, if these Charger skins are in fact DK faction ones.</div></div><hr />
