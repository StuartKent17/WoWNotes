<br />
Statistics: Dragon Soul and Firelands<br />
Patch 4.2 brought us Firelands over six months ago, and in that time roughly 12% of our sample of level 85 characters completed Normal difficulty Firelands. Patch 4.3 was released just one and a half months ago, during the holiday, and already 30% of the sample has killed Deathwing in any difficulty while only 4% has killed Deathwing on Normal or Heroic. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind this sample includes many alt characters and many players have multiple characters, so there is no way to know for sure if more people are raiding. However, we do know that more characters are raiding now than raided during Firelands. <br />
<br />
This time around, the overall sample is around 6 million characters and the active character sample is around 4.4 million. If you are interested in these type of statistics or want to see other information, let us know in the comments! <br />
<br />
First we take a look at the overall population, including every level 85 character that has been active since Patch 4.3 went live. Only 4% of the population managed to do Normal difficulty Dragon Soul so far, and 34% completed it on LFR or higher difficulty. <br />
<br />

&lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Next we look at how quickly people earned the Normal difficulty Deathwing achievement. The holiday caused a slight slowdown in the past few weeks, but people started earning it constantly on the first week. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div id=&quot;DSNormalSum&quot; style=&quot;style=&quot;width:900px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;&quot;&quot;&gt;<br />

&lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Next we look at how quickly people earned the Raid Finder or greater difficulty Deathwing achievement. You can see the weekly growth starts out high and is now rapidly decreasing, as everyone and their alts are have easily completed the raid. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div id=&quot;EasyDragonSoul&quot; style=&quot;style=&quot;width:900px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;&quot;&quot;&gt;<br />

&lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Next we look at how quickly people earned the Normal difficulty Firelands completion achievement. You can see where the Hotfix took effect and greatly increased the amount of kills, which are now leveling off as players don't have a reason to go back.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div id=&quot;FirelandsClears&quot; style=&quot;style=&quot;width:900px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;&quot;&quot;&gt;<br />

&lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Now we narrow our sample to just characters who have killed Deathwing on Raid Finder or greater difficulty. For this sample, 13% of characters have done it on Normal or Heroic difficulty, and 87% of characters did it on Raid Finder difficulty. <br />
<br />
<br />

&lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Now we narrow our sample to just characters who have killed Deathwing on Raid Finder or greater difficulty and completed Normal difficulty Firelands. For this sample, 34% of characters, also completed normal difficulty Dragon Soul.<br />

WoW No Longer Compatible with Windows 2000<br />
In preparation for the upcoming release of Mists of Pandaria, updates to World of Warcraft will no longer support Microsoft Windows 2000. Microsoft ceased support for this version of their operating system in 2010. Players still using Windows 2000 are encouraged to upgrade prior to the release of Mists of Pandaria.

But I'm not surprised LFR is so widely finished VS normal mode. Everyone has the ability to run LFR, even the most immature keyboard turner, so naturally with a larger pool and easier difficulty you'll see more people doing it.<br />

I kind of wish we'd seen a chart comparing the number of people who cleared normal firelands 2 months in VS the number who cleared normal Dragon Soul.<br />

Also, seems the Firelands nerf worked just fine, check out the spike in clears.</div></div><hr />

But I'm not surprised LFR is so widely finished VS normal mode. Everyone has the ability to run LFR, even the most immature keyboard turner, so naturally with a larger pool and easier difficulty you'll see more people doing it.I kind of wish we'd seen a chart comparing the number of people who cleared normal firelands 2 months in VS the number who cleared normal Dragon Soul.Also, seems the Firelands nerf worked just fine, check out the spike in clears.<br />

It all depends on game mechanics. We came from AWESOME PvP, in which even a max-uber-power Paladin had a chance to lose in WotLK to one exploit-fest with totally incompatible playing mechanic between classes in Cata, .<br />
In which some specs and classes can steamroll everything and others can only hide waiting for a POSSIBLE chance to do some bursting.</div></div><hr />

LFR is working as intended imo, got A LOT more people into the content, I'd say it was a success, besides the loot issues.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sensa</div><div class="date">2012-01-10, 05:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the potential issues with LFR is that it may actually reduce overall play time once people &quot;see the content&quot; and/or get the gear they want and it also may or may not increase/decrease progression into regular raiding. As such, I think a more interesting examination of the stats would be to look at the number of toons getting A DW kill (in both LFR and other difficulties) on a weekly basis to determine if a) the rate at which players &quot;burn thru&quot; and burn out on the content and LFR in particular (and establish a baseline for future raids to help determine if the quality of the content is a factor - i.e. lick king better villain than DW) and 2) in the weeks after players, in the sample, stop doing LFR how many continue to do normal or heroic.<br />
<br />
now those are stats i Liked to see chaud and are stats that could help determine the true effect of LFR and possibly end or start some old and new arguments.</div></div><hr />

All of my 85s in my main's guild killed Ragnaros repeatedly, because he had stuff they needed. My hunter for example, still would like the bow and trinket from Rag, even though he has t13 4pc and 380 ilvl gear and no real need for any better gear. <br />
<br />
When the raid was all there was, it was worth putting together alt runs, or joining pugs, for the 378 gear, and it was a chance to practice my various characters' gameplay. <br />
<br />
Now I don't need to raid on them. I have LFR. <br />
<br />
And yes, I'm calling LFR something other than raiding. Not that there's anything wrong with it as such, but LFR, for many reasons, doesn't qualify as 'raiding' to my mind. It's a raiding simulator that awards gear. <br />
<br />
I have a Mage on another realm that I haven't really played much this expansion, but got up to 380 ilvl in a few hours so I could experience the new and improved Fire before it inevitably got nerfed back to earth. That Mage doesn't have a raid spot, I don't really care to attempt to maintain a raiding schedule or even look for PuGs, but give me the chance to get easy t13 4pc and top some meters in a raidfinder group and I'll take it. LFR is (usually) fun, but it's not raiding any more than Rebecca Black is a pop singer.</div></div><hr />

They should have done a statistic on accounts instead of characters, I have 9 lvl 85's and only two of them have done LFR DS.<br />
<br />
And all but maybe one should count as active, not sure what they count as active tho. But I play them all from time to time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because every single person who plays WoW is level 85, has the gear level required to join the LFR and is interested in doing so, right? Personally I'm level 85 and have the gear level, I just haven't gotten around to it yet because I've been busy with other aspects of the game since 4.3. Really, this argument is completely backwards. The simple fact that so many people have completed the LFR compared to how many used to complete normalmode raids means that it did exactly what it set out to do and thus is a resounding success.</div></div><hr />

WoW was never ever 12 million players. It was 12 million Subscriptions™. 6 million+ of which were in Asia, about 3-4 million in EU and about 2 million in NA. Count in the 20% drop in subs since Cataclysm released and you only have a ~1.4 million active Subscriptions in NA right now.</div></div><hr />

A lot of people still find *and will contunue to find* LFR a challenge. Many people will be having their first ever raiding experience via LFR. I am glad jerks like you stay away from LFR, with your social ineptitude and impatience.<br />
<br />
Instead of hating on LFR being so easy, try better to exercise your tolerance and appreciate that LFR is for players beneath your godly (sic) epic raiding experience; LFR represents the first 'M' of MMO, massively, in that it enables (better than ever) the majority to gain raiding experience. Now you can take it or leave it; treat it as a tool for welfare epics and help others whom could benefit from your experience, or run Normals and Heroic DS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a Mage on another realm that I haven't really played much this expansion, but got up to 380 ilvl in a few hours so I could experience the new and improved Fire before it inevitably got nerfed back to earth. That Mage doesn't have a raid spot, I don't really care to attempt to maintain a raiding schedule or even look for PuGs, but give me the chance to get easy t13 4pc and top some meters in a raidfinder group and I'll take it. LFR is (usually) fun, but it's not raiding any more than Rebecca Black is a pop singer.<br />
<br />
And this<br />
<br />
For me LFR was a good reason to to back to long forgotten alts. Got my resto druid in DS this week and I'm now working on level 85 with a rogue which sat at level 16 for 5 years.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekobaka</div><div class="date">2012-01-10, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems the charts indicate that normal DS is easier than normal firelands for the first month. Quite a large grain of salt however would be needed for LFR DS as it has a much higher chance of players bringing in more of their alts. Yes there are those who do not want to run LFR though would that really balance out the many altohalics and other alts that players have leveled up to deal with the accelerated rate of content burn in Cata? Along with LFR being designed for those who havent raided before it shows that possibly not even half of the population wants to even raid, whats scewing this data though is the inactive accounts that are viewable on the armory still. <br />
<br />
What I would like to see is a comparison of those who made it about three to four bosses in FL and DS which is about where PuGs was at the time and than the second to the last boss lots of PuGs and even a number of guilds got stuck at for a long time, particularly before the nerf. The earlier firelands charts did show a large discrepancy between the Rag kills and partial clears which shows that there is a larger portion of those who do raid yet havent been able to beat the last boss. I would like to see the comparison of those who have stepped into Firelands normal to those who have stepped into DS normal while not killing Rag or DW.</div></div><hr />

I didn't insult anyone unlike you. Calling me a jerk isn't polite, you know. I have no problem what other people are doing in game and what they do for fun. I said LFR for ME isn't FUN and that is my right. I didn't say I have godly skills, nor do I raid hardcore. I raid with my friends who help me with advice, and if I can help them - I will. I tried LFR (only first part) after I completed it on normal, and what I saw I didn't like. And with crusader/protectors of LFR like you I am too glad I am not going there.<br />

exactly. any pug raid or raid with a so called casual guild end up yelling at each other or someone for doing something wrong. its pathetic. it's a game and players with nerd rage ruined it. best thing blizzard could have ever done.</div></div><hr />

All of my 85s in my main's guild killed Ragnaros repeatedly, because he had stuff they needed. My hunter for example, still would like the bow and trinket from Rag, even though he has t13 4pc and 380 ilvl gear and no real need for any better gear. <br />
<br />
When the raid was all there was, it was worth pugging it for the 378 gear, and it was a chance to practice my various characters' gameplay.<br />
<br />
I'm in a similar situation and it makes it difficult to see the true picture from these figures. I cleared FL with my main and my most played alt but in 4.3 I've cleared DS and LFR with my main, ditched the alt run and instead cleared LFR with three alts (with three more 85s who will probably make it into LFR between now and the end of Cata). The comparative figures would show one fewer characters completing normal and four doing LFR but it's still only the activity of one player.</div></div><hr />

Now i am not an 8/8 H player and my guild has only morchok H on farm and this week we are working on Hagara....however....I can honestly say that i find heroic Hagara fight MUCH MUCH more interesting than normal. The added (what people might call gimmicks) mechanics and a totally different strategy involved makes the fight much more exiting for me. On that fight you need to be aware of not only boss but making sure the correct people are around you and you are not too far from people either (for lighting phase) and you can't just piledrive through mechanics like you can on normal or tunnel on lfr. for me that fight is very interesting on heroic. So I agree with people saying if you are bored of DS or you think it's too easy...stfu and go try heroics you will find yourself in a clusterfuk very quickly.</div></div><hr />

That's because you're an anti-social player mate. Don't put your burden on the WoW community. People like you shouldn't even be playing mmos.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maarius</div><div class="date">2012-01-10, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the problem with WoW is: <br />
1.) logistics <br />
2.) you will be locked out of content. <br />
<br />
if you are a hardcore-player but lack the friends who like raiding / don't want to play with people you don't know and want to see the endcontent: <br />
-) you have to grind gear in lower tier raids in order to be able to play with your friends in higher tier raids. <br />
-) but if you wait too long, nobody wants to do these lower tier raids anymore it's hard to coordinate with people if everyone wants to play different tiered raids. <br />
<br />
I don't like logistics. <br />
Happy to hear that Guild Wars 2 <br />
-) has extreme hard 5-man raids and you can do them anytime (even the lv.30 dungeons, because your character will be scaled back to lv.30) <br />
-) doesn't lock people out of content (you just have to beat the easy storymode of a dungeon to unlock the explorable mode, which has <br />
<br />
-) all new bosses <br />
-) random occuring events (like a ghostarmy or a big troll-boss suddenly breaking through a wall) <br />
-) min. 3 different pathways to explore <br />
-) optional extra hard side bosses (like a room full of hundrets of spiders, very hard to kill. If you make it a big Spider boss appears) <br />
<br />
so you don't have to grind for max. gear in order to visit those dungeons. GW2 isn't all about numbers, the gear you have when you reach lv.80 should already allow you to participate in the explorable mode dungeons. You still can find gear with better stats, but the differences aren't THAT huge like in WoW. (so not 100-&gt;200 but 100-&gt;105 etc)<br />
<br />
there are still misconceptions about this game (like: it's from the Aion guys, gear is just cosmetic, the ingame store sells items that make you stronger), ... <br />

<br />
That would be 1.25 million *characters* not players. Its highly likely that committed raiders have at least an alt (or 2 or 3) that they'd gear through LFR as well. So the total # of players that completed the content is even less.<br />
<br />
10 million active subscriptions is a highly contentious number, and also reflects all of their asia player base. My guess is that alot of people have a paid sub but stopped playing, or play so casually that raiding is never an issue. Also, some people play exclusively for the PvP component. <br />
<br />
FWIW, raiding isn't the draw that it used to be. I raided through late vanilla, all of TBC and all the way to LC (never got him 25 man, only 10). Can't be bothered to raid anymore... bar is reset every few months, encounters are repetitive and uninteresting, and there's better ways to have fun IMHO. And I can't be bothered with LFR, since i'd only be doing it for the gear...and i'm not raiding anymore, so why use LFR to get gear to raid normal?</div></div><hr />

Then IMHO, the author should really only post percentage.. It's very misleading when you only poll a small sample of characters in WoW.<br />

<br />
<br />
First we take a look at the overall population ...<br />
<br />
A moment ago you said you were working with a sample (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)), but now you say you are working with the entire population (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population). Please clarify.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now we narrow our sample to just characters who have killed Deathwing on Raid Finder or greater difficulty. For this sample ...<br />
<br />
I thought you were still working with the entire population. What sample did you narrow?</div></div><hr />

Can't believe people still use that archaic operation system. Get with the times people! Quit being cheap asses!<br />

Posts like this make me wonder? LFR is pissing on you? Really? I would ask you how but I am pretty sure I can guess most of the response. LFR lets more people raid and see the content. The hardcore still have access to the best gear and the ability to champion themselves as the best of the best by beating the content on the highest level. WoW is a game and I can't stress that enough. It is individuals like you that have made it something much more twisted inn your mind that sadden me. If WoW had not evolved, taken chances, made changes, as well as admit when it messed up know one would be playing. I have the time to play and have raided hardcore. You see I have a life and WoW being a game fits into it. It should not need dominate it. I simply do not enjoy the drama and bull crap that goes along with being in those most hardcore of guilds. Raid finder does not take away from your WoW experience and if you think it does well... sorry Blizzard and &quot;those who don't have time to play the game&quot; are hardly your biggest problem.</div></div><hr />

It's not suprising though that SWTOR has had more concurrent users in NA/EU then wow lately even with the massive sub advantage.

I think this LFR tool is an elegant solvation for casuals, its way too easy for regular players - but hey - who cares, there is still the normal difficulty, which may be also kinda easy, but unless people have cleared the heroic content, or almost cleared i see no reason to complain.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Good enough&quot;??? Did any of you whiners even raid in Vanilla or TBC? Most of the rare items/experiences were nothing more than epic time-sinks. Hell, even the PvP titles in Vanilla required nothing more than having endless hours to devote the game. If you are truly competitive at WoW, skill matters more now than it did in the &quot;glorious&quot; past of 2004-2008. My guess is you, like many posters, want WoW to return to a huge Vanilla grind, where all that is required to succeed is tons of free time. Perhaps SWTOR is the game for you. Like the great John Adams said, &quot;Combat logs are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.&quot;</div></div><hr />

That's quite surprising, I thought it would be much higher. Clearly LFR is working as intended but I don't consider it real raiding. It's easy mode where there are little to no consequences for poor raiding habits. Sure, it's a great addition to the game letting non raiders see endgame content, I agree. But that 4% number has me thinking now the WoW raiding is in seriously bad shape. I hope they fix this!I really enjoy the stats, MMO, keep it up!</div></div><hr />

It's a completely valid statement. The game has its strengths (I daresay it's set a new bar for how good questing can be), but is hardly the be-all, end-all MMO. Not by a long shot.<br />

<br />
Older raids that are fun are still done for a) mounts, b) transmog gear, or c) just because they're fun. If an older tier becomes a ghost town, it's because it doesn't satisfy any of these requisites. Pretty simple. The fact that Black Temple is pugged more than T11 should tell you something :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
...I think LOTS and LOTS of WoW folks have tried LOTS and LOTS of other MMOs...after all, it's what we do!<br />
<br />
I wondered about this too... My answers were &quot;alts&quot; (17 of them) and &quot;pvp&quot; which I once hated and then, on the day I was quitting WoW, about a month after Cata dropped, I somehow had such a blast in a bg and now have 7 toons I pvp with all the time. Am I good, nah... but I have fun.<br />
<br />
About that same time I started trying every MMORPG/RTS and on-line &quot;immersion game&quot; I could, looking for a WoW replacement. I mostly stuck with Free To Plays, but also buying the occasional login (ie: Rift). There is something to like about almost all of the on-liners...but inevitably the sum of the parts can't beat WoW. One of the early posts mentioned WoWs responsive NOW controls and feedback and lifelike character movements -- exactly what must be present before things like lore, quest variety, and player immersion are even thought about - and WoW has all of these. Is it perfect? No. <br />
<br />
Rift -- lasted about 2 weeks for me, enough time to have a toon up to lev 12 and another to lev 6...just too dark and empty.<br />
AOC -- yuck. Movement sucked, quests were ambiguous and when your lev 4 quest log is suddenly filled with stuff you can't begin to do...adios.<br />
yada yada name it i tried it -- all had their chance and none succeeded<br />
<br />
EA games has a couple Free To Plays that are quite cool...Battlefield Heroes is a very cutback and cartoonized spinoff from Battlefield 3...there are 3 classes, something like 5 or 6 abilities in each...PvP here is way cool and a riot to boot! There are no quests, no adventures, no rep...you gain exps and levels on the battlefield within some &quot;goals&quot; given to you. Gear is usually rented for a short time with in game funds or you can buy super money -- that gets you ownership of the gun/rocket/armor -- but it's no biggee, some pay gear is slightly better than the standard issue, but not a lot. (There is a growing movement of purists that WON'T pay a cent and they are somehow still on the rankings board. The vehicles rock, the planes are a blast to fly, and players from all levels (1-30) can be found at the same time on the same battlefield -- the &quot;playing field&quot; is that level :) Why would I NOT want to go full time with something this good? There is nothing to do except the variuos battlefields...not a lot of socializing, no reason to be there if you dont wanna fight. I don't know how but EA cut off a ton of stuff, made it cartoon-goofy, retained the obviously awesome engine running BF3, made it free and it's the best thing going for pvp-ness...and it still can't beat WoW.<br />

I did half of FL reg, maybe 1/3rd of DS reg, and all of DS on LFR. I thought I wanted to raid but after seeing the &quot;so much better than you&quot; crowd and the perpetual rinse-repeat gear update struggle I have rethought that -- I want nothing to do with &quot;end-game rading&quot;. End Game PvP I love...it's so much deeper than a PvE instance could ever hope to be...infinitely variable. I'd rather do that and maybe some 25 ICC with a 5-man, or do duos or trios in BC raids...the occasional heroic, etc... When you finally get your gear locked in and stable...and 4 days later some new tier or drop or something makes half of all your efforts worthless....BAH!! WoW isn't about a contiguous story or really cool things to explore and do...its about a parts list and just as soon as you get your hands on that new stuff you become immediately eligible for the next newer stuff. No Thank You...instead of transmogging my Cenarion over my T11-1/2, 12, 13 mix of gear - I should just put it on and enjoy myself.<br />

Techie stuff is a blast, overcoming challenges is satisfying, the individual and group drive required to succeed in some of this electronic world is amazing...but the bottom line is &quot;If it don't put a smile on my face I ain't showin' up.&quot;</div></div><hr />
