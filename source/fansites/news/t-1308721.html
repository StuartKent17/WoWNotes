<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Punchbag</div><div class="date">2013-06-12, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Item - Warrior T16 DPS 2P Bonus (New) Attacks against a target with your Colossus Smash debuff generate 10 Rage.<br />
Item - Warrior T16 DPS 4P Bonus (New) Your Mortal Strike and Bloodthirst have a chance to activate Death Sentence, allowing Execute to be used above 20% target health. Below 20% target health, Death Sentence makes Execute free.<br />
<br />
That's a seriously good tier bonus for warriors.<br />
<br />
Item - Warrior T16 Protection 2P Bonus (New) You heal for 30% of all damage blocked with a shield and 30% of all damage absorbed by Shield Barrier.<br />
Item - Warrior T16 Protection 4P Bonus (New) For 10 sec after Shield Wall fades, you gain Rage from taking damage.<br />
<br />
2P T16 and 2p T15 for prot combined? Soloing old content could be seriously boss now.<br />
<br />
Will be watching this<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
Looked through warrior changes. <br />
&gt;Impeding Victory buff - Decent<br />
&gt;Enraged Regen buff - Decent<br />
&gt;Titans grip now works on staves and polearms - Don't play fury, but cool nonetheless!<br />
&gt;Intimidating shout change - Definitely like this<br />
&gt;Storm bolt buff? - Only a good thing<br />
&gt;Bladestorm CD reduction - Never a bad thing<br />
&gt;Prot abilities proccing enrage and giving slam to prot is always good<br />
&gt;Slam buff, should help with warrior DPS in PvE<br />
&gt;Vigilence buff - EXCELLENT Change, will be even more useful in PvP. If this goes live with replace Safegaurd for me.<br />
&gt;Warbringer is an interesting change indeed. As is glyph of blitz.<br />
&gt;Shattering throw nerf I can deal with, no problems there.<br />
<br />
Shaping up nicely. Some decent buffs, and a step towards bringing warriors a step back up onto the DPS meters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not corrupted Garrosh in the way you seem to think. Blizzard said he was using the sha we knew he was using the sha this but its not the sha making him evil that's just the way he is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Hunter changes are nice, hopefully MM will be more enticing now.<br />
<br />
Mage changes are cool I guess<br />
<br />
The Rogue changes are needed but still not really what I was thinking<br />
<br />
The set bonuses are interesting as well</div></div><hr />

<br />
That picture says nothing about how he got to that point. I don't think it's going to be the reason he's done the things he's done.<br />
<br />
Who's to say he doesn't get corrupted after he comes to realize the error of his ways ? Or that he's raised from the dead after we kill him ?<br />
<br />
Just stop jumping to conclusions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm hoping they keep him as a bad egg, and basically make this a vibe for power by him. Instead of him becoming corrupted by the sha, he embraces it, and becomes this horrible... thing...<br />
<br />
We'll see.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terminal Lance</div><div class="date">2013-06-12, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">-From the looks of the icons, we'll have atleast one Goblin-themed robot-mounting type fight.<br />
-Pretty excited for the Tier bonuses, but some of these are insanely overpowered. Might not stick but hey, its the last raiding tier.<br />
-Especially excited about 4-piece Enhancement tier: When Flame Shock deals periodic damage, you have a chance to gain 5 stacks of Searing Flames and reset the cooldown of Lava Lash.<br />
-I remember them saying that the final tier bonuses are usually tests to see if they're going to make some of these effects baseline for future content. Hoping Lava Surge is rolled into Enhance in 5.5!<br />
-Nice buffs to Retribution too (again!), but too bad their tier bonuses seem pretty bland :p Might have to dust him off.</div></div><hr />

Seems like all old enchants are scaled up to panda levels and had their item level requirements removed or something. Probably related to the new catch-up systems Blizzard seem to be implementing to all the professions.<br />
<br />
Also, some of those set bonuses are really awesome. I mean, holy priests get to stack a 500% improved Holy Word: Sanctuary via serendipity? That's going to be insane healing right there. Also some nice QoL changes such as resto druids only having 1 shroom to plant that heals for the equivalent of 3 current ones. <br />
<br />
But the most important: TITAN'S GRIP POLEARMS AND STAVES WOOOOWOOOOO<br />
<br />
Now just bring the loot tables and I'm ready for fappin'<br />
<br />
Also; people jumping to conclusions about Garrosh and Sha corruption. It's 99% that he WILLINGLY fuses with the Sha and uses it. This does NOT equal to corruption.</div></div><hr />

Has to be corrupted can't just be evil NOPE<br />
<br />
But Garrosh always has been honorable, albeit somewhat of a douchebag (e.g. bombing of Druids in Stonetalon).<br />
I'd say he was corrupted the moment the mists departed in Pandaland.<br />
<br />
Looks beastly imo. I just hope he's a bit bigger than the Lich King during the encounter.</div></div><hr />

Conclusions, you're jumping to them.<br />

How do you know he doesn't willingly empower himself with the Sha, due to just being a bad guy who will go to any length ? You don't know that.</div></div><hr />

I thought so, too, but I moused over the actual tooltips and there seems to be no change on them. Some kind of datamining / posting error.<br />
<br />
It does appear they've removed a ton of the minimum character level / item level restrictions, tho ... could have huge low level pvp implications ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I hope that mage hat is an update of the Dragon Soul Icon rather than the new mage set, though the warlock one right next to it is awesome<br />
<br />
Lastly THEY&quot;RE NERFING FAR SIGHT?!?!?!!?!!? First they take our Sentry Totem, then they take our Water Breathing, now they take our ability to kibitz random fresh toons from the far side of the continent?? When will the madness end?</div></div><hr />

On the bright side, it'll give us more enchant options for our baby heirlooms. And more INTERESTING options, at that.</div></div><hr />

Garrosh has been searching for ways to weaponise the sha since he has known of their existance, the thing that interests me is the eyes that look like something from twilight hammer, my guess is that links it with the old god Y'Shaarj and his remains found under pandaira, if garrosh has that and purposely infected himself, i think thats a badass way to have the story go, plus he has that bell made from the titans flesh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No he wasn't.<br />
<br />
While leveling, if you leveled in Stonetalon Mountains, he even killed one of his own lieutenants because they destroyed innocent lives after the druid school was blown up.<br />
<br />
He was shaping up to be a good Horde leader, and then Blizzard, of course, threw that story out of the water and made him EVILLLL CORRUPTIONNNNNNNNNNNNN.<br />

Shit goes down in the Vale following the exposure of the Dark Heart<br />
<br />
1. Sha based water elemental boss named Immerseus comes up (ability_shawaterelemental_swirl.jpg in icons)<br />
2. We face the sha corrupted members of the golden lotus quest gibers (Sun Tenderheart mention in raid abilities, she's one of the dailies givers)<br />
3. We face the mogu golem from the dark heart scenario<br />
4. We face the Sha of Pride<br />
<br />
Stage 2: Siege of Orgrimmar<br />
We begin the Siege<br />
<br />
5. We face Zaela's drake and possibly Zaela herself either onroute to Orgrimmar or at the beginning of the siege<br />
6. Iron Juggernaut is the next boss in defense<br />
7. Dark Shamans are the next line of defense<br />
8. General Nazgrim is the final line of defense<br />
<br />
Stage 3: Inner Orgrimmar or something<br />
We've broken through the defenses and now take on Garrosh's greater defense<br />
<br />
9. Malkorok<br />
10. forced to fight slaves?<br />
11. Thok... http://www.wowwiki.com/Thok ???<br />
12. blackfuse, seemingly unintroduced goblin<br />
<br />
<br />
Stage 4: Garrosh's Inner Sanctum or something<br />
Final stage yo<br />
<br />
13. We fight the Klaxxi paragons in a council fight on steroids, probably reminiscent of faction champions<br />
14. Garrosh himself</div></div><hr />

I was truly expecting he wouldn't. We already had the previous expansion full of Old God corruption. I wish Garrosh could be bad on his own, and not because of an external force.<br />
<br />
Who knows... Maybe he is in control of the Sha, and not the other way. That would be refreshing for a change.</div></div><hr />

If you follow the story, Garrosh has been focused on weaponizing the Sha. This could easily be Garrosh just taking all the Sha power for himself and getting super powerful, not a case of corruption.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Silencing Shot personally feels too mandatory for all hunters so it gets baked into MM and BM/Surv hunters lose the talent essentially!<br />
<br />
Lots of the tier 16 set bonuses are looking very strong.<br />
Of personal interest, Hunters' t16 will want to stack more haste to work with the bonuses better.<br />

More talent buffs/nerfs to make the buffed ones more popular hopefully.</div></div><hr />

Not a Hordie so I don't know about that, but ever since post-BC he's always been a douche. Sure, maybe his &quot;philosophies on war&quot; changed, but AFAIK, aside from the Stonetalon quests....he's been known to be a douche.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's always been a douche but he was never insane.<br />
<br />
He'd never be doing the dumb shit they've been making him do in Mists. He wrecked Sylvanas's shit for bringing the dead back to life and calling her a Lich King clone.<br />
<br />
Sad to see the lore developers have lost the ability to create fleshed out characters with a progressive story similar to Arthas. If you're going to decide to make a character evil in the long run, don't cop out and make him apparently bipolar.</div></div><hr />

I think we need to go and look back at the context/wording of the question that led to them saying that, and exactly how they responded.<br />
<br />
Garrosh might not even be corrupted -- he could be willingly empowered. As in, he chose to infuse himself with the Heart of Y'Shaarj. And even beyond all that, all of his actions thus-far -- leading to the revolution -- have been a result of willing action and not corruption. For all intents and purposes, this is not a corrupted end boss.</div></div><hr />

When I think of it, yeah that's true, and the argent raids/dailies werent very major in my opinion in wrath as well.. but I still do think there will be a 5.5, like something minor to tie up loose ends etc, so yeah nothing major, good stuff though I guess</div></div><hr />

Too much potential shitty RNG for warlock 2piece. Movement can make procs useless for affliction and variances in soul fire casting along with saving for burst can screw up overall uptime and movement still screws uptime. Destro gets a nice flat bonus that is also applied to a dot and last I checked crits on incinerate increase ember regen.<br />

Virtual Realms are sets of realms that are fused together, and will behave exactly as if they were one cohesive realm. Players on the same Virtual Realm will be able to join guilds, access a single Auction House, join arena teams and raids, as well run dungeons or group up to complete quests.<br />

That seems likely. It also makes a lot more sense why so many enchants and stat bonuses were changed. Instead of hard iLevel limits, we'll now simply have to deal with the stats auto-scaling down on enchants to match the iLevel of items they are applied to.</div></div><hr />

Garrosh was already a prick before he came into contact with the Sha of Pride. Chances are he willingly uses the Sha's power - the Sha gladly lended him it's power as Garrosh is a perfect tool for it.</div></div><hr />

Isn't it obvious? The male human model stands straight, doesn't have a hunch, has boot options etc, therefor you can actually SEE all the gear in right proportions on a male human, unlike say on a tauren or male orc or a worgen.</div></div><hr />

Who cares when it's going live? They knew the second they announced this that transfer money would go down to nothing. Also you might want to go back to school to learn to read. I never said I was starting a lawsuit. I never got a transfer. Maybe read slower next time cubby.</div></div><hr />

I really hope that doesn't go live, as it's a vital part of Shadowform's design to lower incoming damage.</div></div><hr />

I am really glad they move devs back to WoW from Titan, no way you will get this kind of value from F2P or other MMOs.<br />

Don't want to comment on balance changes since those are really subjective, but virtual realms (overcoming major tech difficulty), new raid, new scenarios, new raid difficulty, etc etc. <br />

<br />
Yeah, holy shit. That's exactly the solution I've thought of that doesn't come with the inconvenience of name conflicts. This is really good! Not only for raiding guilds, but for dying realms overall. Now it's just a matter of merging the right realms to actually get a populated (more than average, imo) realm.<br />
<br />
Will be interesting to see how they plan to merge the realms, how it'll work out with regular cross realm, if from several CRZ groups.<br />
<br />
Definitely &quot;choosing&quot; this as &quot;my&quot; awaited unannounced feature. :)</div></div><hr />

Ilvl looks a little off. Only do lfr as of 5.2 i'd get 483 from lfr and 489/496 from vp vendors. Next tier went to 502 from lfr and 522 from VP. However this tier has 521 from LFR, thats the same difference between tiers but its lower than the previous VP gear, just seems low. Should be more like 528 i think so there is an upgrade on previous tiers VP gear.</div></div><hr />

Its like while its on CD you cant change talent. there is no Actual Nerf other than if you chose it stick with it!!!<br />
<br />
Um, did you not see the part where you get to move and cast for 15 seconds only? Then you have to wait another 1.5 mins to do it again...<br />
I switched from my mage to my lock all because of that talent. Now they'll both be benched. Hunters and shamans still get to move and cast but I'd rather play melee over those derp classes.</div></div><hr />
