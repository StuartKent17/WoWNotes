Glyph of Dark Succor has been redesigned. Rather than placing a 15% maximum health floor on Death Strike healing while in Frost or Unholy Presence, it causes the next Death Strike within 15 seconds after killing a foe that yields experience or Honor Points to heal for at least 20% of the death knight's maximum health.<br />

Raid Instance Nerf in Patch 4.2 only applies to Normal<br />
Of course, keep in mind, the nerfs that were announced only apply to Normal. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/177306/mild-medium-spicy-hot) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2580698481?page=2#24))<br />

Justice Points in &quot;Old&quot; Normal Raid Instance in patch 4.2<br />
Normals will drop JP, Heroics will drop Valor. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/177306/mild-medium-spicy-hot) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2580698481?page=2#24))<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Raid Difficulty Progression<br />
I think the biggest issue now is that Cataclysm didn't launch with an intro raid tier. We're now following through with the stair-step method of having one hard raid and one intro raid, but it took a while to see the plan through -- which is obviously a bit jarring. So now we have a new tier, VP converts to JP, the old tier gets stepped down and the new hotness is going to be that difficult climb.<br />
<br />
I think if we had the intro tier/hard tier available (as we will in 4.2) when the expansion first launched it would feel more natural now to see that stair step just moving forward. With the current setup it seems like we're the bad guys going in and messing with your stuff, and that view is somewhat based on not really including the new harder tier in the equation since it's not available yet. It's just not going to be an issue when the new content is available, but for now it's something to make observations and personal declarations about. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/177306/mild-medium-spicy-hot) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2580698481?page=1#12))<br />
<br />
Firelands Difficulty<br />
If you've completed Blackwing Descent/Bastion of Twilight then you should focus on Firelands (you're ready to step up), but if you haven't yet seen most or any of BWD/BoT we want to make sure you're able to as soon as 4.2 comes out - not spend weeks running dungeons and grabbing the new gear before you can start progressing.<br />
<br />
The content has been out quite a while, there's no reason to make people wait and spend even more time running dungeons to grab the new gear before they can start on raid content they haven't seen yet. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/177306/mild-medium-spicy-hot) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2580698481?page=1#20))<br />
<br />
Encounter Journal and its effect on boss difficulty<br />
Having information on boss abilities within the game will make fights easier than alt+tabbing to a website to read literal strategies, group placements, phase descriptions, if not ways to cheese the encounter? Pardon my sarcasm, but that's amazing! And logical.<br />
<br />
If you're cutting edge you've already seen the bosses on the PTR, you've already read the strategies before the patch is anywhere near release. What amounts to ability tooltips is not going to tell you how to beat a boss, or make you or your raid competent enough to do so.<br />
<br />
It's a cool feature to put drop tables within the default UI, let people get some info on the bosses, and hopefully keep them from having to tab out of the game just to get (usually incorrect) boss ability info from the internets. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/177306/mild-medium-spicy-hot) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2580698481?page=3#58))<br />
<br />
Making Raid Encounters Harder/Easier<br />
Plenty of people like the challenge, but not everyone has the ability or maybe even desire to be in a guild capable of tackling it right from the get-go.<br />
<br />
It's always been our intent to offer new raid tiers in Cataclysm that are difficult to provide challenge to the raiding guilds, and then gradually allow older content to self-nerf as people gear up through VP, and then eventual literal nerfs to the content. That's something we've been communicating for some time.<br />
<br />
Burning Crusade swung the pendulum one way, and Wrath of the Lich King swung it back too far the other. We're attempting to find that middle ground where there's still something brutally difficult for the cutting edge, but content gradually comes down until it's extremely accessible (ie PUGable) either simply through gear proliferation, or literal content difficulty nerfs.<br />
<br />
There's always going to be two sides of the fence, some people want things more accessible for them and that's cool, we want it to be too, and some people think it should be difficult and always be that way because that's the way they had to do it. The fact of the matter is that as an MMO the end-game bar is constantly being raised, and progression content is in general not a place where we're going to purposefully gate prestige through difficulty. There are some exceptions of course, hard modes and unlockable bosses are purposefully there to be more difficult challenges, but as a whole our intent is to create a constantly moving ramp upward for Normal difficulty raids. That has to mean that the Normal raid content that was the hardest will one day be the easiest.<br />
<br />
You will very likely see this same happen for Firelands when the raid tier above it is released. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/177252/im-speaking-from-the-heart-blizzard) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2580598282?page=3#42))<br />

Tier 12 Bonus and Chain Heal<br />
Chain Heal’s bounce range has already been increased about as much as the engine supports without causing odd behavior and/or undermining the purpose of the spell. It’d certainly be a better spell if it jumped 20 yards, but at that point it’s just a smart heal with a funny visual. And if it can bounce to the same player multiple times, then it’s just the best heal to use, always.<br />
<br />
I think you're undervaluing the benefit of not consuming Riptide. That potentially amounts to a sustained 25% boost to Chain Heal’s throughput, which is huge, in addition to the healing conserved by not losing a portion of your Riptide. And while Chain Heal is easier to use efficiently in a 25-player raid, if the heal hits three targets it is quite efficient, and those situations will arise frequently in 10-player raids.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, because healing gameplay is naturally varied (as opposed to DPS rotations for a min/max player), whenever we come up with healer set bonuses, unless they’re incredibly vanilla, they will inevitably favor some healers’ playstyles over others. And the latter group will say “but I never use &lt;insert spell&gt;, this bonus is terrible!” while a separate but less vocal group is giddy over what they’re getting. The original bonus was flawed because it really did play directly into the greatest weakness of Chain Heal in 10-player raids by requiring a 5th target to be of any use, but this bonus will be incredibly strong on 10-player Firelands encounters like Fandral, Beth’tilac, Rhyolith, and more. And on the encounters where it’s weak, Chain Heal isn’t really the right spell to use in 25-player modes anyway.

Sorry PvP'ers, but death strike has been a staple of survival for DKs out in the wild doing quests and leveling up. In Cata they starting messing with death strike that you would take more damage from a mob while casting death strike than death strike would heal you for ... but maybe on a good day you'd tread water health-wise.<br />

I also play a DK, and no. DL's self heal wasn't nerfed, only its damage. It stills heal for the same. Now Death Strike can't even be considered as a self-heal (as in an arena, killing an enemy most of the times will mean an assured victory anyways).</div></div><hr />

Also, Hungering Cold is laughably overpowered as is Ring of Frost. Instant cast AoE CC that lasts for about 1000 years? Ya it needs a nerf.<br />
<br />
Paladin Tank nerf: Did I miss all those people crying about Paladins blocking too much? Is Holy Shield THAT overpowrered? Really? Really Bliz? My Pally is Ret/Holy so Im not taking it that personal but seems a bit unnecessary. <br />
<br />
Sub Rogues: I play sub in PvP and PvE. In pvp, Sub Rogues need to be in stealth to be able to do any damage worth bothering with, so CoS is needed by them if they are popped out or need to kill another target or switch target and they have magic dots on them. For non Sub rogues I can see a short cooldown on CoS being a teensey bit OP.<br />
So to clarify: if you survive a sub rogue's opener they are not a threat after 12 seconds or so. Put a single DoT on a sub rogue and keep it on him and he cant get back in stealth without CoS. So good PvP'ers who know how to react can easily blow CD's when a sub rogue pops out. This gives sub another opportunity to be able to put pressure on someone. <br />
<br />
Cos and Combat Readiness sharing a full cooldown? Wow thats horrible. Maybe a lockout while the other is active that would be fair. This is what happens when you keep giving evryone more and more spells and abilitys. <br />

The DK glyph change is...odd. I get they want to lay down a nerf in PvP but this seems like overkill. I also don't see the HC change going live. It's too weird to already change RoF back to instant while adding a cast time to a melee class.<br />

<br />
They used to run them in blood spec, unholy presence. Then in 4.1 Death Strike stopped giving blood shields unless you're in blood presence, while Dark Succor only worked in Frost/Unholy presence. So they were already nerfed last patch. I'd imagine they do it in blood presence now, which means it still doesn't effect them after 4.1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a seriously casual raider; my guild has two active people in it. We're both 11/12 purely from pugging, and I expect to kill Nefarian any day now in a pug.<br />
<br />
We pugged all of the WoLK raids (didn't complete Ulduar in pugs mind you) and often cleared ICC (killed LK10 with 15% ICC buf - not saying this is amazing, but it was a pug, not a guild).<br />
<br />
I applaud the effort to make old content approachable by pugs. <br />
<br />
Apparently they're not releasing any new 5-mans along with Firelands as I'd hoped (being an altoholic, heroics are my mainstay)... kinda expected them to, dropping 365. If they did, those 5-mans would have been &quot;harder&quot; than T11 raids are now, so you can't expect people to gear up for the old T11 raids using those 5-mans...<br />
<br />
New toon progression will be<br />
<br />
<br />
Get to 85<br />
blue normals (333)<br />
blue heroics (346)<br />
Zandalari (353) &amp; T11 raids (359) - Considering nerfs to T11 raids, they'll be easier than the Z's, though you'll still need at least 8 or 9 people...<br />
[-- unlikely: Firelands 5-man(s) (365) --]<br />

<br />
At first the change seemed like overkill, because it effect both PVP and PVE. Dk's were a great tool for raid guilds, they had a unique survivability that could be used in many situations. Now that is gone, so it will make things a little less interesting.<br />
<br />
Anyway, probably for the better. Having that special survivability made other melee classes less desirable. And obviously it was the same with PVP, as DK's are as FOTM as you can get right now. Anyone who thinks it was balanced is crazy. Really almost anyone could pick up a DK and flounder around endlessly against most people, and just lolstrike themselves back to health. Obviously at higher levels it is not nearly as styrong, but in large part DS is why many people jumped on their DK this tier, so they could partake in that &quot;balanced&quot; ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Holy Shield will increase the amount you block for, whilst Shield Block increases your chance to block (critical block over the unhittable cap). So Paladin's will get 50% physical damage reduction every 30 seconds for 10 seconds providing Mastery scaling doesn't change and Paladin's can become unhittable in 4.2. <br />
<br />
Being a Warrior tank I find this change (providing Paladin's can actually obtain unhittable relatively early on in 4.2) to actually put Paladin's as the best tanks going into the new tier of raiding. Not only for their general mitigation, but also the utility they can bring to the raid.<br />
<br />
I just hope they scale back mastery so this isn't achievable.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, I've no idea what Blizzard is trying to do here. First they say that Holy Shield should be used actively to allow greater survivability. Then they make it a passive.

In arenas atm when you focus on dk you can gain the control of the battle coz dk cant escape out of it and the only thing dk can do is ds and wait for heals.Lichborne and death pact was nerfed with previous patches and they are not so effective.The other overnerf is hc.I think they can remove the hungering cold glyph and make it 50 runic power to cast instead of making it with cast time.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they need to nerf thing to make it puggable though... as you said you expect to kill nef in a pug (as I nearly did on my alt in a pug too last week).<br />
But as far as my opinion on the nerfs tbh couldn't care less - I am just glad they didn't touch heroics. Cheers! :P<br />

And THANKYOU blizz for explaining exactly what I have been trying to do in one of these past forums in regards to the dungeon journal. And they did so quite snappily XD well done considering how much effort theyve probably put into this just to hear a pile of stupid QQ, probably expected but it must get pretty grating.<br />
<br />
You don't HAVE to use the journal, the people who do would have looked up the mechanics online anyway, and a lot of people still will be visiting tankspot and the like looking up what strats they used as they decide their own. And then there's all the guilds that are qqing about having to read strats before a fight just to stay in competition... ... the fact that everything is available from PTR anyway seems to have slipped everyones mind -_-</div></div><hr />

I love all these DK tears. <br />
I don't see how people who play DKs don't think they're OP. Just skilled, right?<br />
Wah wah my DS isn't as good and hungering cold has a 1.5s cast time how will I ever survive? :(<br />
Oh, I forgot the part about how we're so awesome right now that trying to dodge a DK cleave at even semi high levels is like trying to dodge the sun when you walk outside in the afternoon.<br />
<br />
And bad players will still be bad. DK´s needed nerfs, but not the kind Blizz are doing, certainly not compared to frost mages or warrior burst. Once again they change the playstyle of a class to try and balance without actually being anywhere near achieving balance</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is a.... Pally?<br />
<br />
Haha!.. anyways,<br />
<br />
DKs haven't been broken.. they'll work just fine, they'll still have plenty of self-healing. If one small change (that needed to be done!) to the class breaks it for you, go play something else. I play DK regardless of changes. Stop getting so enraged about every little tiny change every patch. and stop getting pissed when there isn't any changes! You should always play a class you enjoy regardless of ANY changes it could EVER have... EVER ! A real man sees a &quot;nerf&quot; as an additional challenge, not a handicap.<br />
<br />
Also and more importantly: Everyone quit crying about catering to casuals and nerfing old content cuz you had to do it the hard way. That would be like my great grandpa telling me i would have had to walk uphill for 3 hours every morning to get to school otherwise it's not fair. Or forcing me to hunt down info in an Encyclopedia cuz he didn't have ezmode free Wikipedias back then. Or telling me that if I want entertainment I have to walk down to the theater cuz having it easily accessible on TV isn't fair, or me complaining to my grandchildren that they have to take an airplane for 18 hours to get to the other side of the world cuz teleporting is not fair, or...<br />
<br />
If you didn't want to do it the hard way, wait and do it when it's easy... why force yourself when you KNOW it'll be easier eventually and you'll just complain about how unfair it is?</div></div><hr />

So do hundreds of thousands of others across the globe. Doesn't mean you know better, much less are able to fix it.

As far as Dark Succor glyph, it was an obscenity that should never had made it live, took them long enough to fix it.

Anyway, probably for the better. Having that special survivability made other melee classes less desirable. And obviously it was the same with PVP, as DK's are as FOTM as you can get right now. Anyone who thinks it was balanced is crazy. Really almost anyone could pick up a DK and flounder around endlessly against most people, and just lolstrike themselves back to health. Obviously at higher levels it is not nearly as styrong, but in large part DS is why many people jumped on their DK this tier, so they could partake in that &quot;balanced&quot; ability.<br />
<br />
so much this, the insane instant aoe blind had to be nerfed at some point.<br />
Also ppl whining about they being cc whole time? hmm geez i wonder.. oh ye you got insane survivability in arena, if it aint the anti magic shield its the loller death strike full hp in no time and still doing tons of damage. good nerfs Imo</div></div><hr />

I don't mind a few adjustments but in 2 patches, they took our self healing habilities completly away. Lichborne/self-DC isn't even worth doing when you get train in arenas, why? because we dont have the dame runic power and the glyph that used to cut the cost in half was nerfed in 4.0.6<br />
<br />
Your complaining about not being able to heal while getting trained? try being ret with 20sec(soon 10sec) WoG heals for 15k while getting trained and compare, not only that even if HC are getting casttime you can actually stop an inc nuke, as it will probably not be able to be interruptable.. and untop of that you got 1 silence, 1 interrupt and a peel (DG), slows and shitloads of utility... get off your high horse, cause these are silly minor nerfs your getting.</div></div><hr />

If they are going to copy another spell, they might as well do it right.<br />
<br />
I don't pvp (go check my armoury) so I'm not terribly worried about this. But I don't understand the logic of &quot;Deathstrike is healing too much in arena&quot; to &quot;Deathstrike can be used max 4 times in an arena fight&quot; when the choice to use deathstrike means that you can't use your nukes. A poster above says that DK's are still a great utility with slows, peels etc. I don't understand how useful any of that is if you are being focus fired by 4 attackers. <br />
<br />
Hungering cold was a frost DK's one defence against being focus fired, too many people on him and they get CC'd. It's use as a Grip+CC defeats the argument that it's OP because it's an instant AoE CC (like scream and howl). <br />
<br />
I just wish people would make their minds up, as these changes really affect those of us who are trying to use these abilities as intended in PvE (HC on Conclave adds, DS on Chimaeron) are getting annoyed.</div></div><hr />

It's almost doing that since it give you tips on how to avoid it by explaining exactly how the spell works (including their weak spots) instead of us figuring out. Remember, wowhead and others aren't blizzard, they're players like us, discovering it as they play, just like us.<br />
<br />
By the way, after all those excuses and new &quot;rules&quot; for the game, the logic says that we won't get valor points anymore from heroics, since it's way lower tier than even T11 normal (wich will give justice points now). Or are we still going to grab most of the valor points for the week from the old heroics??? It's old content, it's not worth of the T12 level... no reason to keep giving valor points for it. Maybe only Zandalari giving what old heroics give now, but to be honest with their &quot;new philosophy&quot; (that will give the same problems from WotLK about emblem confusion that they said was an error) not even Zandalari since it's lower than 359 (359 and lower are considered not worth, old content, now).<br />
<br />
4.2 would need a new tier of heroics.</div></div><hr />

Usually it's a damn right useless solution though. Some ppl might enjoy pugging it now. But the majority will just start complaining about the difficulty of Fire Lands instead.<br />
Just look back at what happened in Wotlk. For each new instance that came out the older content was pretty much deserted and the only reason that some went back to them was to get the achievements and mounts once they overgeared the encounters with items from the new content.<br />
In the end the (vocal)majority that keep whining about difficulty could care less that they can now see and complete the previous raid tier because thats not where the new shinies comes from.</div></div><hr />

These changes are indeed stupid. <br />
<br />
They should not make DS healing differently by presence in the first place, it make the dk mechanics unnecessarily complicated. It should be 10% min healing in any presence. In this way, it nerfs the forst/unholy pvp as people complained, and doesnt change much about blood tanking. And the glyph could be changed to the 20% min healing after killing blow.<br />
<br />
on the other hand, HC is the only cc a frost dk has. dk dont have stuns as warriors/paladins/rogues do. giving a casting time to it, will make it extremely difficult to even use in pvp. <br />
Blizzard could have nerfed its range, or its cooldown, but instead, they make a melee class cc need to be casted. lol</div></div><hr />

My sentiments exactly, and changes like these come too often - forcing you to respec,re-glyph,re-gem and change your playstyle in general... it's getting pretty tiresome.<br />

There are a lot of problem with frost dk atm imo. <br />
<br />
Frost used to be the most rigid, least forgiven, and fun rotation in wrath, then it became more tolerant with the high rime, KL proc rate. <br />
<br />
Blood strike was indeed boring for frost. but instead of buffing it or redesigning a more interesting new blood rune based ability for frost, they simply remove blood runes from the spec. <br />
<br />
This is utterly stupid. blood/frost/unholy 3 sets of runes are the symbol of dk ressource system. <br />
<br />
A frost dk damage was already centered on only HB, OB and FS, and the Rime/KL proc are still for boosting HB/OB/FS damage.<br />
<br />
Now with the 2 x permanent death runes, what does blizzard expect a frost dk to do ??? Ofc 3 button faceroll. <br />
<br />
Now people are complaining frost dk doing too much damage while faceroll spamming, and ofc blizzard will still make strange, irrelevant nerfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been a reader of MMO-champion for many years so seen almost all patch notes ever done. Recently the changes have been not necessary though, and they just change things for the sake of it. It kind of keeps them in a job if they make out they are trying to balance the game.<br />
<br />
Why do people still think that DK´s should be OP because they are a ´hero´class. Do you know how stupid it would be for Blizzard to add a class that was purposefully more powerful than all the others? There are no real limitations on making a DK, why would anyone make anything different. DKs start at 55, that is the HERO part to them, nothing more.<br />

<br />
&quot;I doubt elitists are crying, they've long since moved on from raiding normal mode starter raids.&quot;<br />
<br />
I agree they SHOULDN'T be crying, but they seemed VERY upset about it when Blizzard first announced it.<br />
Same with the new encounter journal. They know much more than what is in the journal,<br />
yet they lodged bitter complaint after bitter complaint about how much they seem to REALLY hate its existence.<br />
<br />
Two different issues. The wanna-be elites are crying about the nerf to dungeons. The elite player could care less about old content. It is the people that are barely downing any heroics bosses now that are crying about the nerf. The real raiders completed normal modes in December. The people crying completed them last month... to them, it is still ´current´content.<br />
<br />
As far as the dungeon journal. The hate is mainly from a minority of players who like to blow themselves up on the first phase of every boss just to see what the boss is going to do. There is some joy in sitting down afterwards and trying to get a grip on what all happened in that 1 minute while someone survived. I can see there point completely The problem is simply they are the vast minority. The majority of raiders want to at least have some clue what is coming at them, which is why most raid guilds require vids, strats and mods. Blizzard just added a feature that helps what most players are doing anyway.. getting a hint of what is coming. When was the last time you did a boss without looking at any information first?<br />
<br />
The nerf to old content is just bad raiders posturing to sound tough. The special snowflake crowd. The good raiders could care less about content they haven´t done in 4 months anyway.</div></div><hr />

Now with the 2 x permanent death runes, what does blizzard expect a frost dk to do ??? Ofc 3 button faceroll. <br />
<br />
Now people are complaining frost dk doing too much damage while faceroll spamming, and ofc blizzard will still make strange, irrelevant nerfs.<br />
<br />
I agree that something had to be done to Blood Strike, and I think that perma Death Runes was a good way to do it, I just don't think they realized what that would do for pvp burst damage and pvp healing. And with healing being tied to the glyph for both Unholy and Frost, there was no way of nerfing the healing without both specs being effected.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, I think Blizzard shouldn't have tried making all specs viable for pve. For the pures and double damage trees for melee, it would be easy to set up one spec to work better than the others for pve and pvp, just like it has been prior to Cata. It sucks being forced to play a certain spec, but it does A LOT to help balance for this game.</div></div><hr />

As for the daily blink, a maloriak drinking content sounds fun. Get a green pot, take a drink. Get a blue pot, drink mana pot. Get a red pot, drink two drinks. See how good a raid group is when everyone is plastered drunk. As for nefarion rides, sounds cool as long as it includes the option to go torch an opposing faction city. :cool:</div></div><hr />

With the amount of elitest whining in this game I'm so glad I don't play it anymore. People think they re special when they down bosses in this game, they are not. Hopefully when The Old Republic starts up it will be awhile before the elitest crowd will be silent for awhile not parading around achievements or complaining about every NECESSARY nerf and ones further down the line so people can actually see the content they paid for while still having a life outside the game.</div></div><hr />

I am already losing interest, slowly but effectively and that's only to the thought of these changes going live.<br />
<br />
What can i say, hopefully Guild Wars II will do better in that department.<br />
<br />
p.s. People have the power to make them change their minds, so keep posting your thoughts on the US forums.Please.<br />
<br />
I concur with you and Inahu. I played since vanilla and have not played WoW for... 4 months or so now. Would log in and wait around town for half an hour and then just find myself losing interest and log out. Don't plan on ever coming back either its just lost it's luster. Even tried Rift for a while but it was pretty much like WoW, sweeping changes without much thought. I'm definitely holding out for Guild Wars II also.</div></div><hr />

Well once again the blundering retards that are currently developing wow change an entire class playstyle for a minor fix. Those fucking morons have no clue what they are doing and are changing core mechanics and playstyles in every patch. I am just completely baffled by how amazingly stupid and incompetent the current dev team is. Seriously, any software dev that is so completely clueless about the product they develop would be fired anywhere else. Fucking inbreed applesauce eating banjo playing toothless fucktards<br />

nerf (and not just nerf, FUCKING HALVE) DK healing, BUFF rogue damage. YEAH, SURE, WHY NOT, they must have downs syndrome I swear. Give the healing a 20-25% nerf, sure, but HALVING IT? WHY NOT GIVE AMS A 10 MINUTE COOLDOWN TOO, WHILE THE DEVELOPER BRAIN-TRUST IS AT IT.<br />

<br />
No see, that's a straw-man argument. &quot;how other classes have had it&quot;. You cannot equate DKs in this way, because opposed to other classes, we have no &quot;get-away&quot; spells to use when were being trained, and therefore have to rely on healing. We have no stuns, fears, disarms, blinks, disengages, sheeps, traps, bubbles, blessings, etc. or ANY other CC mechanism besides HC, which just got nerfed to shit. And BTW, CoI doesn't count, because the DK will be slowed (or stunned) as well.<br />
<br />
In threes, (which I play at 2450) I barely, BARELY survive because i am able to spam DS, because my healer is usually CCd. I have ZERO tools to get away, unlike the other classes, so by nerfing the only two things I have is retarded. Frost is notorious for its kitability as a spec, and its crippling lack of mobility.</div></div><hr />

I don't remember last time i saw a rogue die in an arena match, we even use a stam-stacked one for Carrier in RBGs and we are quite successfull with the strat.<br />
<br />
As far as Dark Succor glyph, it was an obscenity that should never had made it live, took them long enough to fix it. Hungering cold nerf is very poorly tought though, while its one of the best cc in the game, a cast time makes it both extremely easy to avoid and it just doesn't fit the vibe of a melee class, unless they can cast it while moving.<br />

As would warriors, for that matter, as they don't even have a CC ability (other than stuns).<br />

Overall this doesn't affect me as I don't PvP, and my DK is a tank, so I don't use the ability either way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huldu</div><div class="date">2011-05-30, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;content&quot; problem with WoW is that if you're either 1) doing raids and completing them 2) not doing raids because your guild can't handle them - you're eventually going to quit WoW regardless. Now the brute reality is that the amount of people actually doing raids and completing them are far, far fewer than those who can't do them. Just an example the guild i am in is very casual, they can't really do anything, they wipe on the trash in BWD. Most of the players get annoyed and all of the sudden there are no raids going on whatsoever. All of the sudden they are taking the &quot;path of least resistance&quot; ie the arena. They are doing fine in there and are gearing up but many are bored with the game. Quite a few have left &quot;waiting&quot; for the next patch and whatever.<br />
<br />
In WoW you have a lot of content, some of which many NEVER gets to see for some absurd reasons. What Blizzard is saying with a note like this is that - if you're a casual wait 3-4 months before you start playing WoW after a content patch has been released.<br />
<br />
You say &quot;rofl im a casual and we have 12/12&quot;. Mate, you're not a casual. A casual player is those you encounter in the random dungeon finder who dies all the time, deals crappy dps and are terrible tanks. They barely ever actually &quot;improve&quot; their gameplay. The only way they ever get to complete a &quot;raid&quot; in WoW is to overgear it and/or being carried through it.<br />
<br />
Wasn't the whole point of having &quot;2&quot; difficulty tiers on the raids meant to give *all* players a chance? That is not the case Blizzard. The &quot;normal&quot; difficulty of a raid should be aimed towards those who can complete heroic dungeons. The &quot;heroic&quot; mode should be for the &quot;elite&quot;. It's Blizzards game and they do whatever they want. That is fine with me.<br />
<br />
I just hope that they actually do Titan right and try not to go down the &quot;WoW&quot; road. They can't mess up a fps... or well, they can.</div></div><hr />
