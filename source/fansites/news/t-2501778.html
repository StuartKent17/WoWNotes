<br />
This is so incredibly fucking stupid. instead of popping it at 5 second, pot at 1 sec and start your opener, you now have to pop this on 6 sec, stealth at 2sec and pot at 1 sec. This did NOTHING but add a incredible annoyance. What is this change even</div></div><hr />

<br />
then they could atleast put in some code to make it either get you out of stealth in bg's and arena, or some code to make it not break stealth in dungeons and raids</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Incandescent Sliver and Diamond-Laced Refracting Prism trinket buffs are now cleared consistently on encounter, arena, and battleground start.&quot;<br />
