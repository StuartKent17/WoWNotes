Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
I'd like to take some time to speak with all of you regarding our desire to make the Blizzard forums a better place for players to discuss our games. We've been constantly monitoring the feedback you've given us, as well as internally discussing your concerns about the use of real names on our forums. As a result of those discussions, we've decided at this time that real names will not be required for posting on official Blizzard forums.<br />
<br />
It's important to note that we still remain committed to improving our forums. Our efforts are driven 100% by the desire to find ways to make our community areas more welcoming for players and encourage more constructive conversations about our games. We will still move forward with new forum features such as conversation threading, the ability to rate posts up or down, improved search functionality, and more. However, when we launch the new StarCraft II forums that include these new features, you will be posting by your StarCraft II Battle.net character name + character code, not your real name. The upgraded World of Warcraft forums with these new features will launch close to the release of Cataclysm, and also will not require your real name.<br />
<br />
I want to make sure it's clear that our plans for the forums are completely separate from our plans for the optional in-game Real ID system now live with World of Warcraft and launching soon with StarCraft II. We believe that the powerful communications functionality enabled by Real ID, such as cross-game and cross-realm chat, make Battle.net a great place for players to stay connected to real-life friends and family while playing Blizzard games. And of course, you'll still be able to keep your relationships at the anonymous, character level if you so choose when you communicate with other players in game. Over time, we will continue to evolve Real ID on Battle.net to add new and exciting functionality within our games for players who decide to use the feature.<br />
<br />
In closing, I want to point out that our connection with our community has always been and will always be extremely important to us. We strongly believe that Every Voice Matters, ( http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/mission.html ) and we feel fortunate to have a community that cares so passionately about our games. We will always appreciate the feedback and support of our players, which has been a key to Blizzard's success from the beginning.<br />

<br />
That'll come, in time.<br />
<br />
Hopefully troll posts will simply get modded down to invisibility in the meantime. Blizzard should take a look at slashdot moderation system and ask if they can borrow it.<br />
<br />
I really hope all those people who cancelled their accounts stay gone tho. We could definitely do without those kind of overreacters in the game. (Though it is likely they lied about cancelling their account. Please, if they reactivate it, their characters are gone, otherwise their gestures were meaningless)</div></div><hr />

The first one is easy. Publicity.

You know like 90% of the community didn't want the change? Why is it a sad day? This is the same argument as the game getting too casual, 5% of the player base wants super hard raids, 95% is casual. They cater to to the majority, there is no difference in the Real ID issue.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard's ways will always remain hidden in the shadows, us lowbies would never understand their plots. Maybe it was for publicity or maybe to make the talent change seem that much better when put next to the RealID forum change. <br />

Those are just bigger cases which took me 1 min to google, there is lot more to it. If you still call it paranoia, you are either trolling or just blind :)<br />

<br />
However, when we launch the new StarCraft II forums that include these new features, you will be posting by your StarCraft II Battle.net character name + character code, not your real name.

<br />
THAT is why there is safety belts and airbags, to prevent it. Same here, alias is to prevent it.<br />
<br />
The prevention was you doing it or not, it's completely optional and in no way effected how you played the game. You don't need to post on their forums for anything at all except your own amusement, which you can very well do on other forums.<br />
<br />
It's still paranoia regardless of how common it is. If I choose not to drive my car 'cause I'm worried about getting into an accident and dying it's still paranoia even though there's a much higher chance that would happen than me being killed by someone online.</div></div><hr />

I think we can all make up statistics too...like 27% of people use bananas as doorstops. Since I said it on the internet it must be true. A thread on the forums with 100,000 posts in it hardly makes up the majority of people playing this game.</div></div><hr />

But then the only thread they allowed on the official forums about this issue had around 50k replies and more than 500k viewings. Now,that number is roughly 5% of the player base. Too big a number to simply ignore.<br />
<br />
As for the QQ argument.This whole thing has nothing to do with QQ, imo. QQ you get when GC nerfs your class.This was a completely different matter, one of true substance and importance. Personal freedoms and rights, like the right to our privacy are continually threatened one way or another. Rising up to that, is the only solution, if we don't want to end up with an Orwellian society, where everything is monitored and all essence of freedom is dead.<br />

<br />
How is that last sentence not clear? Dumbass<br />
<br />
Key word being &quot;character&quot;, not account. Another keyword being &quot;Starcraft&quot;. Combine those two, and you have &quot;Starcraft Character&quot;.

There will be A Character Name. And B Character Code. <br />

Doesn't make much sense does it? A pointless code that a name could easily take the place of the name next to it? If it's not a unique code perhaps you can provide some realistic insight.. About an addition of a 'code' that replaced the 'name' previously proposed only when they removed the name to begin with..<br />
<br />
&quot;World of Warcraft forums with these new features will launch&quot; &lt;--- What we're doing is simple reading comprehension. <br />

&quot;Let's eat grandpa.&quot; The grammar suggests we're eating our grandfather, but using logic we can find that the statement was simply articulated incorrectly. <br />
&quot;Let's go there instead then.&quot; Yesterday they mentioning going to the arcade but all your friends argued they should go to the beach instead. Using logic where can we conclude they were referring to (despite being vague)?</div></div><hr />

It compromised people’s ability to hunt for a new job. If a potential employer was looking at two similarly qualified candidates and discovered one of them was frequenting a videogame forum, it would negatively impact that person’s chances of getting hired. <br />

<br />
Just because you think it's important to you doesn't make it important to everyone and good for the whole community.<br />

<br />
I don't know why people like you cant seem to understand this, but the forums are 1) not option as far as tech support goes since the CMs and GMs send you to them for problem resoluton and phone/email support is crap and 2) It is funded in part by the monthly fees, there for IS part of the game that I am paying for.</div></div><hr />

It may have been an effective method to reduce the amount of trolls, but a lot of other people would go away too.

<br />
There will be A Character Name. And B Character Code. <br />
If A == B why would they have any reason to add it?<br />
<br />
Because in Starcraft, your Character name is not attached to any &quot;realm&quot;. I find the logical conclusion to be that several people can use the same name, else you'd end up with silly names such as Xenryusho123 and Xenryushoxxx. The code could be a unique code, to differentiate between characters with identical names.</div></div><hr />

But that said, i am very pleased they stopped this RealID implementation focus on forums and i dont have to fight for my privacy just becouse i play a game i like and post about it or ask for help.<br />
<br />
Implementing things like ratings for users/posts, better enforcement of CoC and unique name(id) per account under which you can post are enough tools to get the job done, and it will be welcomed by comunity too.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm not clear why they don't just have people pick a forum username to tie to their battle.net account that is permanent. Then your reputation is tied to a unique forum handle. Simple.</div></div><hr />

THIS, is the one place I do agree upon using the forums. Tech support bs is just that, bs, you have other options for tech support no matter how much you think the forums are 'required'. However, guild recruitment is completely different yet just as essential to the game.</div></div><hr />

No more of this &quot;72 hour ban from the forums&quot; nonsense. If they come back under a fake account, then IP ban them from the forums. What about families that play? Wouldn't that screw up the rest of the family's ability to post on the forums because junior decided to be an as*hat on the forums? Guess junior's going to be getting his as* beat when dad get's home, eh?<br />
<br />
A simple warning before anyone posts:<br />
<br />
&quot;Warning, you agree that the following post is not of an inflammatory nature, with the sole purpose of causing problems on the forums for any single person, or the forums in general. Posting threads/responses in which would fall under the &quot;No Trolling&quot; portion of the forum rules will result in a 100% lifetime ban from the forums. Please review your post to make sure if meets the forum guidelines.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the person clicks &quot;Yes&quot; to continue or &quot;Preview/Edit&quot; to make the appropriate changes.<br />
<br />
Within 30 days, the trolls will have found their bridges to hide under again as hundreds (if not thousands) of their brothers &amp; sisters are slaughtered, thus the forums will return to a semi-normal state of civility.</div></div><hr />

Remember back before the .net merge every player was required to have a unique account name? It's not that hard to think of a name. And for the people who do have numbers in their name such as John2940 I don't see a major problem unless John2740 was posting in the same thread. And aside from the 'realm' forums in WoW I don't see a problem with multiple people with the same name posting in the threads there..<br />
<br />
Easily there will be a Deathdealer in multiple realms and some with the same class. Posting on the dps forums you'd think a similar problem would arise but there isn't. In WoW's system people can use the same names on the forums.</div></div><hr />

Amusing. The first person to say that they don't approve of this starts off by saying they were going to first-post.<br />
<br />
The comic posted yesterday could not have been more true (also Penny Arcade, which I'm surprised wasn't linked here as well).<br />
<br />
The only down-side is that Real ID could have been a huge boon to the forums if it just didn't involve your real name. If Real ID used a pseudonym, the ability to see a person's entire posting history, no matter the alt they're posting as would have been immensely valuable in combatting certain types of abuse. I hold out hope that this is still in the works, but would have required technical changes that they are still working out.</div></div><hr />

I want to thank everyone that canceled for making this statement, and I hope you will return now that this real name nonsense is not happening.</div></div><hr />

They may be a better option over some, but they are still unnecessary.<br />
<br />
This is like arguing cars don't need headlights because no one is forced to drive at night.<br />
<br />
The forums have utility and have always been available to subscribers without cost. Barring a serious, legitimate issue that had no other solution, there is no good reason to deny (even indirectly through bad policy) someone access to something they have previously been able to use.<br />
<br />
edit: also, who ever claimed &quot;the forums are necessary&quot;? Certainly not the person you're responding to. It helps if you actually reply to what people are claiming and not what you imagine they are.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard - 0<br />
People who are paranoid about getting shot irl over this, but want to come across as rational adults who didn't want their names splashed over the internet - 1<br />
<br />
Because only a very little of you had a valid reason, no &quot;omg it might effect my chances at getting a job&quot; wasn't a real reason. It was for the very few that had unique names(if they really had it, I'm sure some of those just said that to look like their bad reason was okay) And even then they didn't allow the idea that &quot;hey this is optional I don't need to post on the forums&quot; to enter their head. They all jumped on the Tech support board but they never asked themselves &quot;Hey would Blizzard really do it for a forum board that is mandatory for posting bugs?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was really just a bunch of people jumping before thinking and flaming 24/7 that they would cancel their accounts if blizzard didn't give them a hug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have a spine? They admitted to having made a mistake and reverted the planned changes. That's a real show of having a spine. Having gone through with it they wouldn't have shown they had a spine but instead proved their complete disregard for their customers.<br />
<br />
And we weren't whiners, we were individuals bringing forth valid concerns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Difference is that you'll be posting using said name. An account name can be excused for looking stupid, since it will only be used at log-in. I'm quite sure Blizzard aren't interested in seeing hotmail variations of character names all over the forums.<br />
<br />
In WoWs system, several people CAN use the same name, but they will be attached to different realms. As I said, you can't attach a Starcraft character to any realm, so it's only logical that there would be another way to differentiate people.<br />
<br />
Either way, you seem to have missed my point. I highlighted another possible interpretation, to have an alternative to the speculative and assumptious claim by the guy who felt a need to strengthen his arguments with childish insults.</div></div><hr />

QQers - 1<br />
<br />
You're misusing the term &quot;QQ&quot; egregiously, here. In fact, on thinking about it, I don't exactly know what QQ means anymore. It used to mean the forum equivalent of whining, e.g. &quot;my autoshots aren't out-dpsing the raid.&quot; When thousands of people gather to protest a change that that has the potential to harm them, I'm really having a hard time calling that &quot;QQ&quot;. By that definition any political protest is QQ.</div></div><hr />
