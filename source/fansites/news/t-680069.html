The Pilgrim's Bounty world event is now on live servers and I guess it's worth a small Achievements guide. First let's start with the description from the official site (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/events/pilgrimsbounty/).<br />
We invite you to celebrate Pilgrim's Bounty with us. It's a time for reflecting on your journeys and good fortune, sharing plentiful food, and stories with friends. <br />
<br />
You can partake in wonderful Pilgrim's Bounty feasts near major towns by sitting at a Bountiful Table and enjoying the foods you find there.<br />
<br />
If you're interested in learning the Pilgrim's Bounty's recipes, speak with an NPC outside any major city. Stuffing and potatoes are easy enough to put in front of a fire, but if you want to cook a turkey, you'll need to catch one first. Unsling your trusty Turkey Shooter and prepare for the hunt.<br />
<br />
Type: Seasonal Holiday<br />
Date: November 22 - 28<br />
Major Cities (Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdom Only): Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, Exodar, Orgrimmar, Undercity, Silvermoon City, and Thunderbluff <br />
Minor Towns: Goldshire, Kharanos, Dolanaar, Azure Watch, Razor HIll, Bloodhoof Village, Brill, Tranquilien, Ruins of Thaurissan, Shadowprey Village, Falconwing Square, Stonard, Hammerfall, Revantusk Village, Light's Hope Chapel, Wildhammer Keep, Chilwind Camp, Southshore, Tarren Mill, Sepulcher<br />
<br />
Bountiful Tables<br />
Bountiful Tables are the centerpiece of the Pilgrim's Bounty celebration. They are tables loaded with food and surrounded by interactive chairs that allow you to eat and share food with other players via the action bar. <br />
<br />
A Bountiful Table is laid out with five different Pilgrim's Bounty foods, one in front of each chair. Each chair has an unlimited supply of one food, and they are conveniently labeled: The Sweet Potato Chair, The Turkey Chair, The Stuffing Chair, The Cranberry Chair, and The Pie Chair. While in a chair, you may eat as much of that food as you like, as well as pass servings of that food to other players sitting in the chairs. Share the bountiful feasts with your friends! <br />
<br />
If you eat five helpings of any single food, you'll gain benefits unique to that food. In addition, if you eat five helpings of every food, you'll gain the Spirit of Sharing which lasts one hour and increases reputation gained by 10%. This is accomplished much faster if you work together with your fellow feasters at passing food to one another.<br />
<br />

Get a Pilgrim's Attire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46800/pilgrims-attire/) or Pilgrim's Dress (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/44785/pilgrims-dress/) or Pilgrim's Robe (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46824/pilgrims-robe/) from one of the daily quests and pay a visit to the hostile capital cities. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now Were Cookin' (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3577/now-we-re-cookin/)<br />
Oh god! A cooking achievement! You'll have to spend countless hours farming level 10 monsters to level your cooking on your alts and get this stupid achievement !!!! No, just kidding. Actually, this achievement alone is probably the easiest and most interesting one. <br />
<br />
All the vendors next to the Bountiful Tables sell a Bountiful Cookbook (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46809/bountiful-cookbook/) for 1 silver, this book contains the 5 recipes added to the game with this holiday :<br />
<br />
(A) Recipe: Candied Sweet Potato (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/44859/recipe-candied-sweet-potato/) / (H) Recipe: Candied Sweet Potato (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46806/recipe-candied-sweet-potato/)<br />
(A) Recipe: Cranberry Chutney (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/44858/recipe-cranberry-chutney/) / (H) Recipe: Cranberry Chutney (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46805/recipe-cranberry-chutney/)<br />
(A) Recipe: Slow-Roasted Turkey (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/44861/recipe-slow-roasted-turkey/) / (H) Recipe: Slow-Roasted Turkey (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46807/recipe-slow-roasted-turkey/)<br />
(A) Recipe: Spice Bread Stuffing (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/44860/recipe-spice-bread-stuffing/) / (H) Recipe: Spice Bread Stuffing (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46803/recipe-spice-bread-stuffing/)<br />
(A) Recipe: Pumpkin Pie (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/44862/recipe-pumpkin-pie/) / (H) Recipe: Pumpkin Pie (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46804/recipe-pumpkin-pie/)<br />
<br />
All the reagents required for these recipes are sold by the Bountiful Vendors in the various capital cities, this is clearly stated in the yellow text of each item : Tangy Southfury Cranberries (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46793/tangy-southfury-cranberries/). The only exception is the Spice Bread (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/37836/spice-bread/) for Recipe: Spice Bread Stuffing (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46803/recipe-spice-bread-stuffing/) but this is pretty much the first cooking recipe you learn and the reagents are available from any cooking supplies vendor.<br />
<br />
Now the funny part! You don't want to spend hours leveling your cooking? You won't have to. You can level your cooking from 1 to 300 just with these 5 recipes in less than 30 minutes, all the reagents are bought from vendors in capital cities and only cost a few coppers. Yes, Blizzard just love you that much. You will also need Wild Turkey (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/44834/wild-turkey/) from the turkeys you hunt in Elwynn Forest or Tirisfal Glades but you will most likely end up with a lot of it ... See below. <br />
<br />
<br />
(H) Pilgrim's Progress (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3597/pilgrims-progress/) / (A) Pilgrim's Progress (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3596/pilgrims-progress/)<br />
Now that you have all your cooking recipes, completing the daily quests shouldn't be a problem. They just require you to bring back 20 units of each food to the quest giver next to the bountiful table. <br />
<br />
(H) Can't Get Enough Turkey (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14061/cant-get-enough-turkey/) / (A) Can't Get Enough Turkey (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14048/cant-get-enough-turkey/)<br />
(H) Easy As Pie (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14060/easy-as-pie/) / (A) Easy As Pie (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14054/easy-as-pie/)<br />
(H) We're Out of Cranberry Chutney Again? (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14059/we-re-out-of-cranberry-chutney-again/) / (A) We're Out of Cranberry Chutney Again? (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14053/we-re-out-of-cranberry-chutney-again/)<br />
(H) Don't Forget The Stuffing (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14062/dont-forget-the-stuffing/) / (A) Don't Forget The Stuffing (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14051/dont-forget-the-stuffing/)<br />
(H) She Says Potato (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14058/she-says-potato/) / (A) She Says Potato (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14055/she-says-potato/)<br />
<br />
Please note that the daily quests aren't random, you have to visit every capital cities to get all of them from the NPCs next to the Bountiful Tables. <br />
<br />
<br />
Terrokar Turkey Time (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3582/terokkar-turkey-time/)<br />
Well ... Go kill Talon King Ikiss while wearing a Pilgrim's Hat (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46723/pilgrims-hat/) and a Pilgrim's Attire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46800/pilgrims-attire/) or Pilgrim's Dress (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/44785/pilgrims-dress/) or Pilgrim's Robe (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46824/pilgrims-robe/). All these items are rewards from the Pilgrim's Bounty daily quests. <br />
<br />
<br />
Turkey Lurkey (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3559/turkey-lurkey/)<br />
This one will probably take you a few days, you need Turkey Shooters (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/44812/turkey-shooter/) from the daily quests rewards to change rogues into turkeys. Using the item will destroy it and you will have to run 8 daily quests to get enough shooters to complete the achievements.<br />
<br />

[url=http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3578/the-turkinator/]The Turkinator (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/november/rogueturkey.jpg)<br />
Depending on how many players you have on your server, you will either love or hate this achievement. Your goal is to kill 40 turkeys in a row in Tirisfal Glades or Elwynn Forest, killing a turkey will buff you with one stack of Turkey Tracker (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/62014/turkey-tracker/) and you have 30 seconds to kill the next turkey, etc ...<br />
<br />
Even if it sounds simple, it's fairly easy to run out of turkeys and if you attempt to complete this achievement during prime time you will most likely end up insulting someone. <br />

Not that I need more than two characters with max-level cooking, but if it's just a fire-and-forget type thing, I may as well.<br />
<br />
What I like about this holiday achievement is that there's no randomness to it. No &quot;pray that the Squashling drops&quot; or &quot;holy crap, I hope I get the right candies and I only have X chances&quot;.<br />
<br />
Though on my low-pop realm, I'm not looking forward to hunting down Alliance rogues. Probably get guildies to take turns rolling level one alts.<br />
<br />
Does Ikiss have to be on heroic mode, or can he be on Normal mode?</div></div><hr />

When you sit at say the Pie chair, you are unable to eat the pie. It's blacked out. Also, if you try to pass the pie to another player at the table it says, &quot;invalid target.&quot; The other tables at our other three major cities are working properly, however with this you are unable to obtain the Pilgrim's Paunch achievement at this time. :(<br />
<br />
Wondering if any other servers are experiencing this issue?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Approximately 1h after posting this, a GM showed up in Elwynn and took the tables away. Within 5 minutes or so, the tables came back and are working properly. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Completing enough of the normal quests requiring you to cook and hand in a certain amount of X seasonal food will eventually reward you with a Turkey Caller (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=62012). It spawns a Lonely Turkey (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=32956) which you can kill and loot for one (1) Wild Turkey (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44834)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trucidor</div><div class="date">2009-11-22, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm confused as to how you can get from 1 to 300 cooking with those five recipes:<br />
<br />
Spiced Bread Stuffing - Requires Cooking (1)<br />
Pumpkin Pie - Requires Cooking (100)<br />
Cranberry Chutney - Requires Cooking (160)<br />
Candied Sweet Potato - Requires Cooking (220)<br />
Slow-Roasted Turkey - Requires Cooking (280)<br />
<br />
Does the Stuffing recipe really stay green for 99 skill-ups? I would find it hard to believe that even the Pie, Chutney, Potatoes, or Turkey would stay green for 60 skill-ups.<br />

Hit one of the supposed hot spots in Elwynn, but it was camped and there just wasn't enough turkeys. Got to 20 a couple times before it ran out.<br />
<br />
So I figured I'd go over the Lumber Mill, hoping not as many people would be in that area - and decided to kill any turkeys I saw on the way for their loot. Well, before I knew it, just from running around spamming macros, I had 35, and got the achievement soon thereafter. A /tar Wild macro definitely helps. As does eating some Tracker Snacks before hand.<br />
<br />
Also, lol @ the Sharing is Caring achievement. How exactly is stuffing your face with 5 servings of 5 types of food at 5 different tables considering sharing?</div></div><hr />

That's what they said about Noblegarden Eggs, but they were camped from the start of the event to the finish - because the eggs still had value even when you had all the achievements done.<br />
<br />
Same thing with the turkeys - even after you kill 40, you can still kill them for the loot (use for dailies, auction house, whatever). It's going to be a pain in the ass. Getting on at off-peak hours, using a macro and tracking beasts will at least make it easier.</div></div><hr />

First time I got the stacks to about 19 and it dropped.<br />
Around that amount again, dropped.<br />
Couldn't even get it that far a few times.<br />
I went to lumber mill area to try like someone suggested. That worked out better.<br />
I got it to 39.. omg almost. No. Dropped. &gt;_&lt;<br />
20ish again, nope<br />
37.. dropped. GOD. Screw this.<br />
So at this point I was going insane and looked to see if there was a food that can track beasts. Apparently Tracker Snacks can. Oh my god. It made this achievement sooo much easier. It's as easy as connecting the dots. <br />
<br />
So yea. Invest in Tracker snacks. It'll save you a lot of frustration.</div></div><hr />

with the amount of people doing it on my server you were lucky to reach 10 stacks of the buff... and that was at 4am. so trying this when everyone logs back in will be hell.<br />

but what really annoyed me is that i got to 39 stacks and was casting at the 40th turkey and a paladin runs up and kills it. at that point this achievement had given me an anger induced headache and i gave up.</div></div><hr />

You only need to kill the mobs in the doorways. Most trash here is completely skipable at lvl80.<br />
The first boss is skipable, just walk around it.<br />
The boss itself is REALLY easy. He teleports to right in front of you. When he does this, he'll go immune for a few seconds, this cannot be dispelled. He also does his AoE, you can bubble through this.<br />
Every so often, he'll use polymorph, which he'll then break as soon as he melees (hits for almost nothing)<br />
At low health, he uses a mana shield. This can be dispelled, or just nuked through.<br />
<br />
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR HAT AND CHEST PIECE EQUIPPED BEFORE PULLING THE BOSS.<br />
If you pull him without it (like i did lol) you can reset by running back into the previous room. The boss doesn't seem to pull the rest of the trash if you do this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even late at night, 2 am when I did it, people are still actively doing it. Albeit, less people, but if you bump into anybdy else ,your screwed. I lost 2 35+ stacks at 2 am. So fucking annoying. <br />
<br />
Blizz should have done any of these with this achieve. <br />
<br />
- Increase the spawn rate on the Turkeys<br />
- Make them avaiable in more then 1 area so your entire faction is not in the same zone trying to get the same things. <br />
- Give you longer between Turkeys. 30 seconds is not long enough.<br />

Turkeys were already spawned, no one else was around, and I got the achievement at 1:03. If you haven't done it yet then I suggest waiting until a day or two before the end of the event. Bring your Tracker Snacks and your /target Wild macro. Having a friend to act as a spotter also helps, I'm told. If all else fails then just don't stop to loot -- you probably won't need the food anyway, unless you are leveling cooking.<br />
<br />
The rest of these are very easy. For Pilgrim's Peril, Horde characters do not need to flag to do Ironforge and Stormwind, and Alliance characters do not need to flag to do Orgrimmar and Silvermoon. The chairs are outside the city proper at those locations. The only catch is that you cannot sit at a table if you are in combat. If you aggro the guards, use an aggro dump, or run past and leash them if you don't have an aggro dump. MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FORGET TO PUT YOUR COSTUME ON BEFORE DOING THE ACHIEVEMENTS THAT REQUIRE IT! A guildy of mine hearthed out of Darnassus and then realized he didn't get credit.<br />
<br />
For Turkey Lurkey, don't shoot rogues that are already under any kind of polymorph or disguise effect (including the turkey costume itself). You WILL NOT get credit for this. You will, however, get credit for shooting rogues that are on a flying mount, although there will be no visual change and you may get an &quot;immune&quot; message.<br />
<br />
Two days of dailies give you enough items to complete everything, as long as you choose the rewards wisely and don't waste Turkey Shooter charges.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ironforge? Fight your way up the hill or out from the tram and be prepared to face down an army of allies trying to prevent you from sitting in the chairs.<br />
<br />
Jesus, took me nearly 20 minutes and I was only saved by a small army of Horde coming to wipe the floor with half the city and let us sit in the damned chairs.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking a better place for these might be closer to Kharanos.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ironforge was also easy, I did it yesterday at the afternoon, and no one cared in all off the Citys. 0 Deaths in any off the Ally Towns.<br />
<br />
But unfortunatly i messed up 2 Rogues yesterday, so i have to wait until tomorrow with the Meta. 5 Dailys and 6 Rogues, that means there is one Rogue to much for today ^^</div></div><hr />

Albeit, less people, but if you bump into anybdy else ,your screwed. I lost 2 35+ stacks at 2 am. So fucking annoying. <br />
<br />
2 is too early (maybe later this week it's possible at 2). Do it between 4-6. There were still 2 or 3 people doing it but the area is big enough for them.<br />
<br />
Still I killed the last turkey with 2 seconds left on the 39 stack buff.<br />
<br />
My shaman now also has cooking skill 330 or so. Great holiday! Annoying but really great ;D<br />
<br />
Need the horde rogues too, will try in the evening in lagforge..eh I mean dalaran (or have some guildies make level 1 rogues to turkeynize)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The achievement is meant to put Players into conflict with the opposing faction, bringing anyone who wants the achievement to the gates of the enemy’s major cities.<br />
<br />
<br />
So moving the Iron Forge Table closer to Kharanos, would dilute the spirit of the achievement.</div></div><hr />
