We recently released an update to the Mists of Pandaria talent tree (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/mists-of-pandaria/feature/talent-calculator). Since the expansion is still in development, these updates represent a snapshot of where we are at any given moment and not a final design where we step back and say “Ladies and gentlemen, we have achieved perfection. Let us not change a thing.” If you’ve been playing the game for a while, you’ve probably realized by now that we never think we’ll hit perfection, and we probably never will.<br />
<br />
One design that we haven’t focused on much yet is the plan for various group buffs and debuffs. Some specs have their buffs in place and some do not. Rather than trying to describe each omission, we thought we’d just dump the whole design on you here. As with the rest of the expansion’s systems, we’re not even in beta yet, so there’s plenty of time for things to change.<br />
<br />
First, some underlying design goals, so you might understand where we’re coming from. Our main goals for group buffs are:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Make you feel more powerful when grouped with other players.<br />
Give you lots of freedom to invite whom you want. This gets to be a problem when there are too many mandatory buffs spread out among too many specs. . .<br />
…But not offer too many incentives to class stack. If you can achieve every buff with, say, only three players, then there might be a tendency to fill all of the other slots with whoever is best for a particular situation. Some class stacking is inevitable at the cutting-edge level, but to some extent, the players on the cutting edge of raiding enjoy extreme min-maxing. For the rest of us, we try to make sure you can finish all of the encounters without feeling like you need a huge roster of folks waiting in the wings for their one fight.<br />
We tend to be more generous to DPS specs, since groups -- especially raids -- already have ample reasons to bring tanks and healers.<br />
We generally don’t want a DPS spec to have to switch to a different spec in the same role just to bring a different buff. An example would be a Combat rogue who has to go Assassination just for a buff. In our experience, players are less likely to switch from a ranged to a melee DPS spec just for a buff, so DPS shaman and DPS druids might bring different buffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
And finally some notes on the categories below:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The list only includes what we consider “traditional” buffs, such as Prayer of Fortitude. It doesn’t include utility like being great at snaring, battle rez, knock backs, high DPS while moving, and other mechanics. Those ultimately all factor into a raid or Battleground comp as well.<br />
The matrix is a little more complex than it appears. A paladin, for example, can only offer one Blessing at a time, while a warrior can only do one shout at a time. You can’t assume one character can cover every buff or debuff listed below at the same time.<br />
Some of these are active (you must cast them, like Prayer of Fortitude) while others are passive. Note that totems no longer bring passive buffs as a rule.<br />
You’ll see several categories consolidated or gone. Bleeds no longer made sense, since everyone who cared about bleeds already buffed themselves. Magical resistance we just removed from the game, though there are some abilities that provide magical damage reduction.<br />
We are still likely to use the design that hunters, especially Beastmaster hunters, can fill in for missing buffs or debuffs by using certain pets.<br />
<br />
<br />
As always, we’d love to get your feedback on this design.<br />

<br />
Otherwise generally nice<br />
<br />
Edit: As far as I can tell from talent calculator Dark Intent is now the 10% spell power buff so that streamlines another buff. With the addition of Symbiosis for druids (http://wowbeta.stratics.com/posts/mists-of-pandaria-talent-calculator-update-feb-15/) which supposedly is like a utility version of Dark Intent - the druid and target each get a utility spell swapped for example a druid tank gives Symbiosis to his paladin healer. He gets Consecration and his healer gets Rebirth (b-rez). Since DI is off and Focus Magic is nowhere to be found on the lists I'm wondering why they are trying to do another of this 1 target kind of buff. Could you imagine Focus Magic being a bit like legendary staff but when shared with someone else they can proc a spell on all their spells that depends on the mages talents (Fireball/Frostbolt/Arcane Blast) and vice versa. Obviously there would be certain combos that would be best Fire-Elemental, Frost-Frost, Arcane-Balance etc like Dark Intent for shadow priests but then again they removed that so why would they make/keep/expand Symbiosis or Focus Magic...</div></div><hr />

I thought they were going to make DI a raid wide haste buff instead of the current version (haste for 2 ppl and increased dot/hot).<br />
Weird to see it missing here :/*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hey Zeus</div><div class="date">2012-03-09, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">itd be great if they made these affect bosses. since for the most part you cant use like 3/4s of your 'special' abilities against bosses. i like to be able to gouge thaddeus if i so choose. <br />
<br />
otherwise... nice i guess? i dont really care about buffs... skill &gt; buff anyways.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebren</div><div class="date">2012-03-09, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really wish they change the concept where melee bring melee buffs and casters bring caster buffs. Basically to get your healers a full set of buffs, you're going to bringing alot of casters. It just continues to promote stacking alot of casters and bringing the minimum number of melee. Throwing spell haste and spell power on some melee would help alot.</div></div><hr />

I believe that Dark Intent is the 10% spell power buff for Warlocks now<br />
<br />

What happened to Horn of Winter?<br />
<br />
Think Horn of Winter is the 10% attack power buff</div></div><hr />

There aren't ENOUGH of spells like Dark Intent, Unholy Frenzy, Power Infusion.. for example. <br />
<br />
To promote engaging, engrossing and involved, intelligent group based MMO play, you must give players spells that give them a choice; ie: do I use this on myself to perform better personally, or will I save it for the melee dps hero when he pops his self buffs?</div></div><hr />

We recently released an update to the Mists of Pandaria talent tree (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/mists-of-pandaria/feature/talent-calculator).

The goal is to make you feel stronger in groups. Your dps in a raid should be tons better than in a 5 man. <br />
<br />
Isn't there enough going on in a fight, you want more things to watch out for? What's the difference between pushing a button before the fight or not pushing it at all?</div></div><hr />

Read Ghostcrawler's first bulleted item in his post: so individual players are stronger in groups.<br />
<br />
Anywho, the only thing that makes me sad about the buff changes is that they are removing paladin auras from the game. *That's about as defining to Paladins as totems are to Shamans. *In fact, in the last few years there have been a LOT of defining Paladin characteristics that have been removed from the game....<br />
<br />
but I guess all of those characteristics that defined Paladins, made them similar to their WC3 predecessors, were either two overpowered or simply not active enough to be 'interesting'.<br />
<br />
Still. *I'm still mad that the aura ground effect -- the REALLY long-standing visual indicator for Paladins left over from WC3 -- has been taken away from paladins and given to holy priests. *I mean that's just screwed up.</div></div><hr />

Just as Druids will bring MotW, Priests will bring PW:F and Paladins will bring BoK. Whereas previously Resto Shaman could bring 6% SP, Stoneskin and 5% spell haste all at the same time, this is no longer the case. I won't have my hopes up for being competitive in healing though, as that hasn't happened since TBC.</div></div><hr />

I agree, what happened to earth and moon? you need at LEAST 3 classes with this, just like 3 having sunder. Sunder and spell damage are easily teh two most important debuffs, 2 is not enough. but i already raised this concern here<br />

rogues with armour reduction is probably the most worst off currently <br />
<br />
I hope that this has been taken into account and the buffs have a long duration atleast more than 5mins, and the debuffs if they do not have a long duration atleast make them apply and refresh their duration with a staple ability, eg colossus smash with sunder or mortal strike for the reduced healing, shadow bolt/incinerate with 5% crit. <br />
<br />
I'm a bit annoyed at 5% spell haste only being available from those classes, druids have 4 specs shamans have 3 and priests have 3, the odds of actually having a caster spec for those classes can be very small. <br />
Although i seen the idea behind melee bringing melee buffs and casters bringing caster buffs, it kind of fails when certain class specs still bring more buffs/debuffs than other classes where their buffs/debuff apply to all their specs. <br />
<br />
IMO just give it up and make the buffs apply to all specs of that class, because your still limiting which classes can come with what spec <br />
<br />
&lt; Off Topic Rant &gt; To the 10man haters shut up about no incentive to run 25man raids, they are immensely harder to maintain and run, i prefer my current 10man guild to all of the old 25man and 40man guilds i've been in over the years. There's no need for dkp there's only 11 of us, which means no need for a website or someone to make extra time to keep it updated, everybody is much closer so it heavily reduces people leaving or having guild factions splinter off, and there's only a GM and 1 Officer, and almost every decision is made collectively so people are rarely upset. So at the end of the day which do you prefer spending time raiding or dealing with guild drama and out of raid tasks?</div></div><hr />

Because buffs/debuffs give you a reason to group up. Grouping with other players literally makes you stronger than playing solo because you get stat boosts. Thats the only reason Buffs exist really.*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just don't agree with you, that was the point of playing 25man, to have all buffs and be stronger.<br />
I think their doing this to simple things up, and make classes even less unique, this way is easier to go for 10man focus, i'll not be surprised at all if 25man is removed from the game at this point, btw i'm a 10man player that raided about 2-3weeks in 25 and felt in love with it.</div></div><hr />

I just have to agree on this one too. By the time you have dotted CoE on all the mobs in the pack... no wait, you don´t even get to dot all the mobs before they´re dead and rest of the group is wondering what the hell is this lock doing ´cause dmg output is soooooo low.<br />

These two things are just few of the reasons why I stopped playing warlock as my main raid/dungeon char after playing it from wow day one for five years. Now it´s just a tailor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it looks ok overall but the biggest 2 problems I see (like many others) are spellhaste and the spelldmge debuff.<br />
Giving Spellhaste only to hybrid casters it feels like you are forced to play them when you are playing a shaman/druid/priest. with this you wont have a chance to bring a feral or enhancement anymore and you will probably bring only one (the strongest dps) of those three classes as damage dealer.<br />
<br />
concerning the 8% spell damage 2 classes are just too few but I can understand why they took them away from dk and moonkin.<br />
Dk: they dont want that you have to switch from frost to unholy only that you bring a debuff and you should rather play which specc you like.<br />
Moonkin: They want you to feel more powerfull in a group and right know Moonkin brings (almost) all buffs he needs. 5% stats, 3% spellhaste and 8% spelldamage (so only 5% crit and debuff and spellpower are missing). While this isnt a problem for the raidgroup you really dont feel to much of a difference in your damage when you are in a group since you bring most of your important buffs yourself.<br />
<br />
I still think they should (and they will) give those 8% to someone else and not only warlocks and rogues.</div></div><hr />

We want 10 ppl raids difficulty to NOT be balanced around the chance that they are able or not to bring all buffs to a raid. -&gt;<br />
We want Blizzard to consider the fact that this WILL imply that there will be some class stacking in 25 ppl. -&gt;<br />
We want Blizzard to NOT ALLOW such a huge difference between a raid that stacks 1-2 classes, and one that is balanced spec/class wise. -&gt;<br />
This will mean that classes will have to be balanced around both BURST DPS AND OVERALL DPS. WE WANT BLIZZARD TO CONSIDER THIS WHEN THEY ARE MAKING PVP PLANS FOR THE GAME. <br />

<br />
<br />
We are still likely to use the design that hunters, especially Beastmaster hunters, can fill in for missing buffs or debuffs by using certain pets.<br />
<br />
this is a great thing for us, especially in mop where pets can have any spec (i'm pretty sure i read something like that a few weeks/months back). no cunning pet dps loss for 8% spelldamage ever again! yeah i'm really looking forward to mop. not having to take a particular spec for a silence or a stun plus now this will really increase our choice possibilities. <br />
<br />
as for the balance among the classes - yeah it is really important that one class can't be simply replaced by another without risking to lose something else. the total power of buff sets plus utility should be similar across the board. looking at stuff like spell damage vulnerability - the first thing that came to my mind: wtf, why rogues? that doesn't make any sense. second: hunters (any spec) probably will still be able to bring it. they are now at least.</div></div><hr />

that +5 mastery buff looks nice :) <br />
Good stuff actually, I like the changes and the new +5 Mastery is a good addition as well. <br />
That 5 mastery is gonna get those windwalker monks invited to EV-YRThAnG I do believe, like the 3 posters before me, that it is meant to read &quot;+5 PERCENT mastery buff&quot; - but right now it just says +5 which wouldn't be very impressive at all. This also spells out that mastery is going to be even more important in future than it already is. Hunters <br />
Where is this going to leave Hunter pets as far as providing buff and debuffs to the raid? <br />
A complete slap in the face to hunters, is there any reason to bring a hunter to a raid anymore? <br />
Hunters will act as &quot;wild cards&quot;, being able to provide probably all or most of these listed buffs. Just bring in the pet that's needed. EDIT: This was in response to an above question. Unfortunately Namarus and Zedextenr are right, Kikiyodragon is only partially right. Why? In a 5-man party (dungeon) you are likely to not have a buff or debuff you would like to have for a given encounter, even more so in a 3-man group (new encounters in Pandaria!). For dungeons bringing a hunter, especially with the LFG, is always welcome, due to the versatility of a stable of pets. Sadly, 5-mans aren't really the top-end of the list of considerations... raids are. However, when it comes to raiding the buff Hunter pets are bringing are always overwritten by the stronger buffs of a particular class. In other words: for raiding hunters are not bringing any buff - but do they add more dps than others? What we have seen in Cataclysm they were not top of the dps list - AND NOW they don't even bring a buff worth mentioning. So I agree with Namarus - if you are facing an encounter with a 50/50 chance of beating it - which responsible raid leader would invite a hunter and leave one &quot;buff-bringing&quot; class on the bench? I am sure all the hunters here will agree with me: Being a hunter is fun. It is fun to play and I want to raid with him as much as the next. But it would help my argument if I could bring something &quot;special&quot; to the raid, too - and more than just &quot;versatility&quot;. Besides, some buffs from pets are indeed ONLY available from BM hunters; as everyne knows the weakest dps spec of the three... Spell haste <br />
As everyone can easily see, spell haste is way too hard to bring for 10m (if the raid size doesn't change). Even if they decide to go with 15, there's still some chance that there will be no boomkin/elesham/spriest. It seems like the blizz post is no longer accepting comments - perhaps they made a typo or made a mistake? Edit: they spawned a separate discussion thread. I would agree, this would spell out to always bring a moonkin or a shadow priest or an elemental shaman to a raid if you want spell haste. However, those hybrid classes would otherwise potentially never get a raid spot vs a &quot;pure&quot; dps class. In so far I welcome this change. Shaman Lastly, an observation of my own. 1) Spell Power [...] Brought by: Any mage, any shaman, any warlock 2) Haste [...] Brought by: Frost and Unholy death knights, any rogue, Enhancement shaman 3) Spell Haste [...] Brought by: Balance druids, Shadow priests, Elemental shaman 4) Mastery [...] Brought by: Windwalker monks, any paladin, any shaman Arguably the most powerful buffs are all brought by a single class. Invite a shaman and you almost certainly have a much needed buff covered - while other classes have to share &quot;their&quot; buff probably with another class in the raid. Seeing the history of WOW from Vanilla to now I think the WOW developers *still* favor playing troll shaman ( old saying from Vanilla times) :)</div></div><hr />

i cant beleive that people dont like that elli shamies balance druids amd shadow priest are the ones with the 10% haste buff. they wouldnt get a spot if not and people wouldnt play those classes. i seems that the pure dps classes are going to be at least 10% more dps</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delaios</div><div class="date">2012-03-09, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way I see +5 Mastery: <br />
As an example, one point of the Marksmanship's mastery gives a 2.1% chance to fire an additional ranged shot when firing any ranged shot. With the buff, you'll get an extra 10.5% chance to fire an additional ranged shot, on top of whatever your current mastery is at. If you've got a 30% as MM right now, with the buff you'll get 40.5% chance. If as Survival you currently have 12% extra elemental damage due to your mastery, you'll get 17% extra elemental damage after the buff. If a Holy Paladin puts a 20% shield on a target after a heal now, they'll put a 27.5% heal with the buff.<br />
<br />
There's a huge difference between a Mastery Point and Mastery Rating. It obviously won't be +5 rating, because that would be insignificant.</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about? There are no &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;weak&quot; buffs, pets can provide (almost) every buff. If you are complaining that in a 25 man raid, all buffs probably already will be covered - well, that can be said for every class.<br />

This also spells out that mastery is going to be even more important in future than it already is.<br />
<br />
Do you actually notice that +5% Mastery actually translates into +1 Mastery if you reach 20 Mastery? And 20 Mastery aren't that easy to get. +5 Mastery is way better than what you want...</div></div><hr />

They better give every pure dps class cleave that hybrids can dream of, better survival and fucktons of other things, otherwise they may just aswell remove pures from the game.

The more i read the Elemental shaman buffs and talents the more i want to stop playing my balance druid.<br />
Please allow players to battle ress if a shaamn in their party has Reincarnatioin ready so that i can stop playing. because a shaman bring: <br />
+5% spell haste<br />
+10% spell power<br />
+ 5 mastery<br />
+ tranquillity without even stoppping dps<br />
+ they have Incarnation baseline, are great at aoe dps and on par with boomkins on single target<br />
<br />
a Balance druid brings<br />
+ battle ress? no because any other druid can give it with symbiosis to a paladin<br />
+5% haste ? no because an elmenal shaman can give it<br />
+5% stats? no because many other calsses can give it<br />
+5 mastery? no because that's a buff we can't bring<br />
+10% spell power? no because it's brought by every other caster class except priests<br />
+8% spell dmg taken? no because You removed it<br />
+great aoe dps ? no because fire mages, shadow priest and elmental are on par or better<br />
+great single target dps? no because without a leggendary weapon and DI we are like shamans and shadow priests and in mop we have nothing more than them<br />
+great dps while in execute phase? lol NO we are the only retards that can't increase their dps when the boss is under 30%<br />
<br />
<br />
They should explain, why the hell someone should bring a moonkin to a raid if we can't do better dps than others, we suck in execute phases, we have to waste 1gcd to increase single target damage, we bring no unique buffs, and every utility that we bring if it does not decrease our dps (tranquillity vs healing Tide totem) can be given by other druid throught symbiosis ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
One problem I see is that a lot of 10 mans currently rely on their resto shaman to provide 5% spell haste, if it's limited to only ele shamans then that could be bad for some groups. Moonkins are probably the least used dps in 10 mans and because shamans are such strong healers right now, most groups don't take en ELE, but a resto instead as having two mail intellect gear classes in a 10 man is dumb. This leaves shadow priests, which are a great option. <br />
<br />
But, Blizzard shouldn't need to cater to 10 mans anyway.<br />

Source please.<br />
Also still it doesnt solve the problem cause i cant use any pet i want. I remember back in vanilla i used to run with ZG bat (screech was much better than claw for anything but pure dps, and this random rogue uncovering, sweet shit) and i loved it. Especially when beastial wrath was increasing size of pet by quite alot. I once managed to ahve bat so huge that it was nearly filling whole ah room in ironforge. Now, so what i can use wolf for 5% crit or hyena for bleed. I want to use a cat or bat or w/e else i want. <br />
Then comes problem of pet switching in combat, look at heroic raggy for example. Having ferocity pet out with ap buff ready for every wave of adds was amazingly good. In fact every encounter when you ahve short pause was epic for pet switching. If i don't have 5 wolves for example i cant do that or we lose the 5% crit. If i have 5 wolves and raid setup changes, i have to port back to city to switch pets around...<br />
The design is majorly flawed. What they should have done is make talent trees for pets just like it is for players. Basically you tame w/e pet you want, for example a cat, then you chose w/e it should be tenacity, ferocity or cunning and then you pick talents for it and then on last talent you can pick the buff/debuff you want it to bring...</div></div><hr />

Being a pure should means that you can change your talents to change your PLAYSTILE see arcane mage vs fire mage, markmanship hunter vs survival hunter, affliction warlock vs ddestruction warlock.<br />

Being an hybrid means that you can change yout talents to change your ROLE, there is absolutely NO REASON for which we should suck in what we do because for the very same reason an affliction warlock when using a destruction spec should suck because he is a dotter and mages are the one that deal damage with single target casted abilities.</div></div><hr />

Moonkins have: 5% Stats and 5% Spellhaste<br />
Shadows have: 10% Stamina and 5% Spellhaste<br />
Elementals have: 10% Spellpower, 5 Mastery and 5 % Spellhaste<br />
Further:<br />
Moonkins provide: 1 Battlerez and tranquility<br />
Shamans: Healing Rain (which can be talented for 10% magic damage reduction), a self-rez and most important - Heroism.<br />
Shadowpriests have nothing beyond their 2 buffs, and stamina is the first buff you'd drop.<br />
<br />
And also, no, other classes don't need the spell haste buff, not without buffing (Shadow) Priests and possible Druids in the Buff department.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not seeing priests or mages bringing any debuffs to the table and it's completely irrelevant for rogues (unless poisons are turning into magical effects?????), whom already cover most of the other debuffs. <br />
Mages have 10% Spellpower, 5% crit and heroism. They don't need more.</div></div><hr />

Because those 3 specs ALSO deserve a raiding spot in 10man set-ups ...<br />
Just because they deserve a space doesn't mean they will have one. A typical 10 man dps makeup will be 2 melee, a hunter and two casters. We shouldn't have to force our long term mage or warlock to drop a spot for a brand new hybrid dps. Giving a huge caster buff like that only to the hybrid dps just doesn't make sense.*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, except that's not true. Combat Rogue's Rupture was not buffed by Rogues, it was buffed by Druids, for example.<br />
<br />
No, what he said is still valid. The only classes that really truly relied on bleed damage provided their own debuff. That would have been Feral Druids, Arms Warriors, and to a lesser degree Subtlety Rogues. Rupture hasn't been a major staple of Combat's rotation in ages (barely a 1% DPS gain when there's a debuff present) and the only reason Assassination bothers with it is because Venomous Wounds is tied to it and not because of how much damage it does on its own, even with a Mangle debuff.<br />
<br />
Rogues might have bleeds, but that isn't one of our main sources of damage (at least directly) unlike the classes GC was alluding to.</div></div><hr />

Of course. Another elitist who thinks they know better. I'm pretty sure you'd be happy to be benched and be unable to experience all of the content just because you enjoy playing a hybrid class. Being forced to level and gear an alt just because the fight calls for it. That's not fun. Last I checked, this was a video game.

You get 8 /10 people in a 10 man you can only pic 8 of the buff / de-buffs. Same in pvp 25 mans etc. To balance 10 and 25 man you just let them get 2 buffs per person in the 10 man group and have int, stam, mastery etc as baseline to make up the 5 missing between 2 per in 10 man and 25 man buffs.<br />
<br />
This would hit the &quot;you are more powerful grouped up, bring the player not the class, and eliminate &quot;we don't want players going the spec they hate just to bring a buff&quot;. Then again when Spec XYZ drops to like 1% of the player base playing they would actually have to work at fixing it with this scenario...so GL getting that in place!</div></div><hr />

They could have been referring to Fury Warriors. Because in MOP Fury no longer brings the 5% crit buff, they used to bring via Rampage. Rampage is removed in MOP.<br />

Buffs provided by classes were designed to make raidmaking in wow difficult. Do I take a frost DK for haste buff, or maybe enh shamsn for Bloodlust, even tho our enh shaman is worse? We wont see this question anymore. Evenybody has all buffs now. This state is strange. When buffs are so cheap, why do they even exist now? Blizzard should either remove then or, like somebody had suggested already, give 'a sack of buffs' at the beginning of a raid. Or maybe simply return to a great system, where class buffs were unique, and everybody felt needed in some way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In some cases, all it did was bench classes/players in favour of others because they brought certain buffs. Certain buffs you &quot;have&quot; to have, such as Bloodlust. <br />
<br />
In 25 man it's not so much a problem as to total number of classes you might hve is higher so the chances of you having a class that brings that buff is quite high, but in 10 man, you can find yourself without certain buffs/debuffs quite easily.<br />
<br />
<br />
And that was the reason for giving other classes the buffs like bloodlust.<br />
<br />
<br />
Prot Paladin<br />
Prot Warrior<br />
Rogue<br />
Fury Warrior<br />
Warlock<br />
Mage<br />
Spriest<br />
Holy paladin<br />
Disc priest<br />
Resto druid<br />
<br />
Without the mage and the changes for cata, a group comp like that in a 10 man run would not have bloodlust.</div></div><hr />

No....in general. Thats what they literally do. They make you stronger when you group up. ...come on guys open your minds, there's more to WoW than raids... I'm talking about game design. You can't disagree with a fact.<br />

This is exactly what I was thinking. Less complex, and people will bring the player not the class in most cases because they will have what buffs they need with only 4 people. I think this is the best way to solve this &quot;bring the player not the class&quot; for buffs issue. And it's still beneficial whenever you are solo questing you can keep the buffs you need for your class, as well as just doing heroics or dungeons in general. Just make it as a passive buff that affects all party or raid members whenever you choose the spec you are going to play as. It's simple and makes the most sense.</div></div><hr />

Now it's simply removed so all bleeds do 30% more damage without debuff. Uh how about, I dunno, Combat Rogue. You know, the highest dps melee spec in the game right now. You know, the one that uses Rupture. Yeah well, they can't even use Rupture in a group without a bleed debuff because it's a dps loss over a Eviscerate without the bleed debuff. Yeah, you heard me. Every group that wants to bring the highest dps melee spec to their raid is also forced to bring an Arms Warrior or a Feral Druid.<br />
<br />
Oh, and people bitching about the Spell Damage debuff on Rogues are retarded too. You guys ever hear of Poisons? Yeah? Well they're nature spell damage and until recently also relied on spell hit to connect, even Deadly Poison which only has a 30% chance to proc to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lot of 10mans don't have mages as well.<br />
Give this buff to mage = no more raid for locks?<br />
<br />
For pvp good idea as well, like that big nerf for mage and nomore dps<br />
<br />
You mean what subtlety rogues allready got...</div></div><hr />

I will just enjoy the rest of the game until then. And if I get the urge to play in a broken pvp system I'll just log back on to WoW. But really, for all of you who are so pissed off and complaining about how long it has taken for D3 to come out, if you are that upset then why not just skip the game and save your money for a more awesome game like....... Dragon Age or SWTOR .... oh wait they are already there and they sucked because they were released too early and broken.</div></div><hr />

Her power stat offsets Ders's PvE stats. Jillian takes less damage because of her PvP Defense (let’s say it’s 50% damage reduction), but Ders still has 30% damage reduction innately, so he doesn’t blow up either. Again the difference is smaller. If Ders wants to get serious about PvP, he’s eventually going to want PvP gear, and Jillian will want more PvE gear to do PvE.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you can still do pvp in pve gear...great. That's all i'm getting from that. Sure Ders will be hit a little harder, but if he happens to be the FoTM class it won't matter because he'll have enough survivability to negate that extra resi and enough burst to drop Jillian like a rock.</div></div><hr />

Basically all they do is penalize groups that don't have the optimum raid comp.=<br />
===<br />
Just revamp the &quot;luck of the draw&quot; buff, and give it to every group that gets formed. That would meet all of the design goals.=<br />
==<br />
As for class stacking, wouldn't it be better to design encounters that don't benefit from stacking a certain class? Or maybe to redesign how spells work? Instead of having 5 Hurricanes going at the same time, let the 1st one go off and give the other 4 druids &quot;a more powerful spell is already in effect&quot;. Or maybe have a new mechanic with diminishing returns where players combined their powers to cast the same spell, and they both get credit for it in the dps logs.=<br />
==<br />
I wish Bliz would quit wasting resources on technical minutia masturbation like this and give us more content to do instead of making us fart around with group comp.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ebonia</div><div class="date">2012-03-10, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not drop the amount each players buff bring to the table and simply have them stack. For example My main is a priest. More stam. Great. But now another priest will be less likely to be added to raid because the buff is already there. So why not make stam for every priest maybe 5-7% but make per priest. So 3 priests in the raid gives everyone a 15-21% stam buff. Then design raid bosses to match that design. <br />
<br />
So that lets say you can't just throw 10 priests in a raid to have a massive amount of stamina. Or maybe cap at 3 buffs max. Just an incentive to stack classes or not. Or to try different raid make ups to beat a boss based on stacking. And the bosses buff is based on your buffs. So if you are stacking stam as a raid the boss just hits more often harder. If you stack attack power maybe the boss has a faster enrage. If you are Changing the experience just about everytime you fight the boss the boss never gets old. <br />
<br />
Maybe one raid boss 20% haste is the win, maybe 20% stam is the way, maybe 20%xxxx. Just chnages the experience everytime. <br />
<br />
<br />
Another idea is to make buffs out of combination of classes. Like the old chronotrigger. For example: A disc priest casts his raid bubble. And then another priest does. Something special happens. Maybe instead of 10% damage reduction from each they stack and offer 25% together. Or make the bubble bigger. <br />
<br />
Maybe if you cast Guardian Spirit on a party member and if another priest does the same it acts as divine shield on the target for the duration. I know this is a stretch, but I dont think there must you can do in the way of buffs that make them exciting in anyway anymore. You might as well remove them and make them all passive.</div></div><hr />

I'm okay with it if we get to keep the expertise part of the talent. Even if hunters do end up with needing expertise, I think we ought to enjoy an advantage with that secondary stat still.</div></div><hr />

What about priests? We can just buff stamina (and any warlock/warrior can) and nothing else.. I really don't like these news.</div></div><hr />
