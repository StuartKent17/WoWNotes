Patch 5.4 Vengeance Change<br />
Ghostcrawler talked about a potential change to how Vengeance (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/93098-vengeance) works in Patch 5.4 last week, as well as answering a few questions about it. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/may/veng54Changes.png (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335073711105376256) <br />
<br />
Please don't do this. I do not wish to be made back into a simple meatshield. Staying alive and doing good damage is fun.<br />
Your damage will still be fine and higher than pre Vengeance. Tanks don't need to win meters IMO. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335221769986265088))<br />
<br />
Who benefits from this change? dps who like topping metres?<br />
Healers who don't have to contend with tanks sitting in fires? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335232096404643841))<br />
<br />
If all that loot didn't get people running 25 mans why do you think vengeance will? I don't get it man honestly.<br />
It's not intended as a 25 perk. The environments are different in terms of DPS and require different numbers. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335223312722587648))<br />
<br />
I think it's in addition to the PvP nerf tanks are getting theyre working hard to balance PvP and it's PvE<br />
It's not a PvP issue. It's some protection against tanks doing unusual or goofy things to increase their AP to unintended levels. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335224955790823424))<br />
<br />
Why do you want to make tanking more difficult? I would think with few tanks and healers you would want to make it easier.<br />
Do some quick calculations. Do your tanks hit those numbers regularly without doing things like solo tanking? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335231771333496832))<br />
If that's your reasoning I guess I understand it. If your goal is to make solo tanking harder this will do it. <br />
We do want to make solo tanking harder on fights intended for 2 tanks. Solo tanking is fun to a degree, but it shouldn't be the right answer to increase DPS or mitigation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335796194687188992))<br />
Just want to point out that this change would hurt 10m far more than 25m though, compounding factors involved. I really don't understand why you think the cap in 25m should be higher than 10m even with higher tank damage.<br />
Tanks are a greater percent of damage done in 10s. 1 per 4 DPS rather than 1 per 7 or so in 25s. Which means tanks should care more about their damage in 10s than in 25s which is odd. And because tanks do get hit harder in 25s they need more Vengeance to translate to higher active mitigation. So we think the pitch is sound on those fronts. Where it runs into trouble is that tanks don't have the same health. When the cap is lower, high health tanks will just have higher Vengeance. Furthermore, mitigation not based on Vengeance, such as Death Strike, just become more powerful at the cap. These are problems we'd have to solve if we go through with it, but there should be lots of PTR testing for 5.4. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335794908067672067))<br />
<br />
Seems like a 180 from what you preached awhile ago, awhen you were fine with it. Why the change in philosophy?<br />
Tank DPS will still be quite high even with this change. Wait for some players to estimate numbers. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335232271554592770))<br />
<br />
I can't understand, why tanks dps was affected by this feature, if you could have just buffed threat directly.<br />
We like for tank damage to be relevant, and for active mitigation to scale. Vengeance provides all of that in addition to threat. Having huge threat modifiers on low damage abilities was also something tank complained about constantly. It may bug DPS players to get out DPSd by a tank, which is understandable, but that happened in dungeons way before Vengeance. Overall Vengeance still solves a lot more problems than it creates. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336246046797746177))<br />
<br />
Perhaps the source of vengeance needs to be looked at. Im not sure the complexity but can ground aoe not give it<br />
Yes. We are going to start flagging certain ground mechanics to not give Venegance. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336249388903047168))<br />

Random Battleground Healer Balancing Disabled<br />
It looks like the long queue times were being caused by the new balancing system. <br />

Elite Gear and Rating Requirements<br />
Don't worry, elite gear tied to rating is coming back next season. <br />
As I understand it, this is indeed the current plan. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/261258-so-t2-elite-gear-25000-cap-only-what/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8874477775?page=1#9))<br />
<br />
Talent Choice Simplicity<br />
Well. To be fair, a lot of people never look up how to spec their characters, and so in those cases the old system probably felt slightly more dynamic. Unfortunately what they didn't know is that their choices were probably wrong. But maybe they don't care that their choices were wrong and their character was suboptimal - that's an honest way to play a game. Not everyone wants to ensure their character is maximizing its output, and it's the look and feel of the system that's more important than its actual effect.<br />
<br />
That said, the new trees are still superior in offering competing options and each one can change up how your character plays, and differentiate it from someone else. If you look at build guides these days the suggestions for talents are usually just breakdowns on how each one works and which ones work better in what situations. There generally aren't any clear cut builds because most choices are viable depending on what you're doing. Obviously everyone is going to have favorites, but the fact that talent builds are a discussion instead of a map on how to place points, I think it's worked out quite well.<br />
<br />
I'll add in the caveat that it's not perfect, some trees don't offer great options, some options aren't taken very often, and those are things we'll continue to tweak. Overall though we're quite happy with how the new trees have hit the goals we set forth. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/261257-this-game-has-gotten-too-simple/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8874847843?page=2#33))<br />
<br />
Conquest Point Catch Up<br />
I've not even done arena on this char in this season, and my cap is only 10k. <br />
This is because the catch up system doesn't function as is explained in the opening post of this thread. The cap you mentioned in your post is actually correct if you have not earnt any Conquest points yet this season, because we are in week 10. The formula is as follows (As Russlad said):<br />
<br />
(Week of season x 1000) - Conquest already earned. = Conquest cap <br />
<br />
If the result of this equation is a negative or below your normal weekly cap, this means that your Conquest cap will be calculated as it would any other normal week.<br />
<br />
If you weren't 90 during those weeks you missed don't get any extra points from what I understand. Seems kinda buggy, my SP that has missed loads of weeks didn't get a bigger cap either but granted it has full gear. <br />
This is incorrect. If a character dinged level 90 this week, their cap would be the same as a character that has been level 90 since patch 5.2 but has not earned any Conquest points this season. You do not miss out on cap for weeks of the season that you were not level 90 for.

Future<br />
Please dont nerf flying because of a small minority sport like world pvp.<br />
We like the MoP solution for now - no flying while leveling with some no fly zones on top of that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332561189466943488))<br />
<br />
Consider adding a LFD-style bag system to LFR. Dps get shorter queues, tanks and healers get occasional rewards. Everyone wins<br />
We might. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331875826192760832))<br />
<br />
How long do you think your expansion design methodology (new continent, new class/race, 3 new herbs/ores/cloth) can last?<br />
I think players want to see some new gameplay too and not just new iterations of the things they've seen before. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331888826760953858))<br />
Even if they aren't for you, challenge modes, pet battles, the farm, scenarios were all new types of ways to spend time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331888954129387520))<br />
<br />
Not saying it’s bad, I like it…just feels totally different.<br />
The 5.0 talent design will stick around for awhile. We agree that leveling is missing frequent rewards though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332575909649457152))<br />
The *current* talent design feels pretty solid to us. We'll iterate but no overhaul plans. #famouslastwords (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332638175405150208))<br />
<br />
Why not spend time optimizing existing game systems like crafting instead of adding new systems that eat up developer time?<br />
Ideally we try to do a little of both. Some players get bored of the old systems even if they are very well polished. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332567027610951680))<br />
<br />
A patch used to include dungeons and raids, not a patch is just balance and dailies.<br />
Dragon Soul came with few new boss models and virtually no new architecture because of the 3 dungeons included in that patch. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331891490609582080))<br />
By contrast, Throne of Thunder has a lot of new boss models and a lot of architecture. It came at the expense of no dungeons. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331891691449626625))<br />
Is there a happy medium? Can we do both? Perhaps. It's something we will work on in the future. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331891765915308033))<br />
Now granted many players enjoyed the heck out of those dungeons. But others were quite candid about the raid. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331891596926791680))<br />
This makes me believe that dungeons take a lot more effort than many peeps realize. oO Loved the Eternity one.<br />
The architecture (the physical dungeon) takes a very long time. The encounters take time too, but usually less. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331924508992733184))<br />
You can mitigate that by doing outdoor dungeons, but it's easy to overdo those. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331924600046907393))<br />
Why can't the scenario team work on dungeons instead? Can't stand scenarios as healer; even in guild as disc.<br />
Good dungeons require a lot of art. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332544999587737601))<br />
<br />
ICC had new boss models, a lot of arche AND dungs. And you were going to hire more people since 4 years ago<br />
We could only do that because the previous tier had a rather small raid and dungeon (that are not universally loved). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332561738639753216))<br />
We could delay patches more in order to have more content per patch. Not sure that's the right answer either. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332561861746761728))<br />
Could also hire more, which we are trying to do. That's a slow solution though unless you're willing to sacrifice quality. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332562136695992321))<br />
Couldn't you combine Scenarios with 5 man logic and use existing environment? Same for raids?<br />
We could, yes. Concern would be that players may view that as rehashed content and not the &quot;real&quot; dungeons they were looking for. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332575015809724416))<br />
<br />
I hope you guys understand the no new 5 mans announcement, non-queueing for heroic scenarios, etc. drive away casual players.<br />
We're not sure that just 1-3 new dungeons provides content for players for very long. Even Magister's I didn't run 30-40 times. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332554182211022849))<br />
<br />
tri-spec won't happen, fine... Where are the proving grounds? A whisper in the wind.<br />
Working on them. But when we talk about unannounced features too much they tend to become &quot;promises.&quot; Just the way it goes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332564235450191872))<br />
<br />
Why not use scenario to show progress in the stories in EK/Kalimdor? Like scenario showing the war in Ashenvale/Gilneas?<br />
That would be cool. Currently our scenarios are focused on recent events, but the possibility certainly exists. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331932036552069121))<br />
<br />
Will an item level squish affect our ability to solo older content? If it doesn't, I have no problem with it.<br />
The goal is it will not affect your ability to solo older content. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331879944839917568))<br />
Squish is useless, because it just delays the inevitable. Numbers will get out of hand again. Regular squishs inc?<br />
Maybe? With the squish we had planned for MoP, we wouldn't need to do it again for 2-3 expansions. Every 1 might feel weird. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331924010856222721))<br />
<br />
Any plans to impelement an in game voice communication? You need other software to play any serious pve/pvp. Isn't that weird?<br />
Would love to do it, but it's one of those solutions that you have to get right and we certainly did not with our first attempt. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331880773512753153))<br />

Healers who don't have to contend with tanks sitting in fires? (Source)<br />
<br />
OMG I'm tired of these dumb ass'd nerfs and these dumb ass'd reasons for doing so. So because you have some eager tanks out there ignoring fight mechanics to continue there rotation, means that the rest of the tanks should suffer?<br />
<br />
Those same players that stand in fire as tanks are the same players that would stand in the fire as dps, it isn't the Role that is being played that is causing this to be an issue.<br />
<br />
So with this same logic, what would you do to dps to stop them from standing in the fire to &quot;help the healers&quot;???<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but I normally bite my tongue so to speak but stupid sarcastic answers like this pisses me off, especially when you take satisfaction away from something that wasn't hurting anyone.<br />
<br />
For example their dungeon tool gained from this in cata when vengeance changed because believe it or not, people respond to numbers and that is why so many more tanks transfered over from dps, what you think this is going to result in?</div></div><hr />

We could, yes. Concern would be that players may view that as rehashed content and not the &quot;real&quot; dungeons they were looking for. <br />
I don't get it. The environment is &quot;rehashed&quot; regardless of whether it's a dungeon or a scenario. Why is it okay to apply it to one and not the other?</div></div><hr />

Who gives a fuck if the tanks are outdpsing everyone. You should see it as a good thing; your raid is getting a lot of extra dps making fights a lot easier. If you have a paladin tank, it's a double bonus since you have a lot of heals going out.<br />
<br />
But no, it seems like people care more about their own ego than the actual ability of their raid as a whole, and they would rather see fights become harder as a result of tank nerfs than tanks doing high dps on tough fights.<br />
<br />
Apparently, damage dealers are not satisfied with tanks being screwed out of Brawler's Guild and PvP.<br />

If you would actually read the thread regarding the topic on the official WoW tank forums, you would see actual problems with this change. On high damage fights i.e. heroics, it may be a really big problem. It is also a much unneeded change and will only result in stamina having a much higher value (it is already the highest value stat by far for Paladins at least), and average raid dps on heroic fights becoming lower.</div></div><hr />

So, your concern is the extra dps the raid will lose, making encounter more difficult? Well I am sure they will balance it. Besides, not DPS gets more pressure to cover tank damage loss! Really no need to cry. UNLESS... you feel good being up there in the meters which makes you like the selfish DPS you are describing...<br />

<br />
Exactly! Stamina should have been higher in value! You are tanks. I am sick on seeing tanks hunting non-tanking stats in gear and still be effective. This is not normal. I understand that they made tanks gameplay more interesting by adding the active mitigation (was a DK tank before all this happen to the rest of the tanks) but they still overdid it. <br />
<br />
We have paladin tank in our guild that stacked haste like no tomorrow. We actually disenchanted any item with &quot;tanking stats&quot; on it! He even claimed priority on horidon's heroic trinket! You know... the haste one? Well, we reached tortos... and guess what? His haste setup was not that good against aoe tanking. And we could not use him there effectively. I can sure say that he can shove his precious dps gear up his ... a$$</div></div><hr />

the vengeance change is another stupid design decision, they should actually be beyond that after all these years *sigh<br />
<br />
I especially find the reasoning complete bullshit, if a guild decides to let the tank stand in dmg effects to gain veng stacks, than this puts a strain on the healer, right -&gt; but if they(healers) can't handle it no guild will do it -&gt; no reason to force a design on the player when the freedom of choice fixes all that stuff already!!!<br />
<br />
standing there as the meatshield and being fisted while usingonly threat skills brings the tank back to the days where nobody wanted to play the class, because it was so dull and unsatisfying... <br />
I even don't understand whining dps, because they will always top the meters over tank dmg on single target occasions... if not they're doing it wrong</div></div><hr />

Your paladin gearing haste has nothing to do with failing on tortos, haste is fantastic for aoe tanking, I one tank tortos as most paladins do with haste step up, it was more likely your healers failed at keeping his shield topped up.<br />

look it like this:<br />
Yesterday, i was at horridon hc with my guild tanking with a druid (im a DK)<br />
we started to speak about the armor buffs and what not, he said: well, i have now over 120k armor.. and 60% crit..<br />
i said: i have 56k armor and 13% crit.. <br />
<br />
that's the diff between a DK and a druid..<br />
<br />
i got 2 shotted from 2-3 stacks from horridon at p3, while he stood there taking fucking 14 stacks and solotanking the damn boss from 200 mill down to a kill.. <br />
fun for a tank? hell no..<br />
<br />
and now they are nerfing the vengence like that`? more fun tanking? hell no, i see my self have aggro problems with our 500k+ burst rogue :/ <br />
its just.. no, its not fun to tank anymore when they do stuff like that..</div></div><hr />

I agree that seeing your name on top or near the top of the charts as a tank is great fun, especially when you're in a multi-add fight, properly tanking.<br />
<br />
Having Vengeance proc off stuff tanks shouldn't be doing (standing in the bad) seems to be more the issue than &quot;tanks doing DPS&quot;. Hell, the tank doing the DPS they currently are is what's keeping one of my guild's raid teams alive at the moment, helping to shore up some lacking numbers from the DPS that's a bit lower on the charts. I mean, if tank #1 can put out 100k, while median DPS is 115k, the low DPS is putting out 60k, and tank #2 is putting out 50k, I don't see the problem; tank #1 is essentially replacing low DPS on the charts, with low DPS doing &quot;tank damage&quot;, all while doing the tanking job they're supposed to be doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the people who complaining about clearing are normal mode players. show me a normal mode tank that gets close to 250k vengence since even the 30% cap will be 250k vengence. I get over that on 3 fights. DA which i tank 3 adds at start for 700k vengeance abuse, solo tank iron qon I hit like 250-300k with all dogs. and ill prob hit it on ra-den p2. highest ive seen up to 50% on ra-den is like 240k. Change will for the most part only eliminate the abuse of stuff like triple add DA to hit 700k vengeance and basically 4 shot adds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not even close to a 70% nerf in reality. It is a 70% nerf in maximum theoretical vengeance but it is impossible to achieve those levels of vengeance anyways (unless your doing something weird like the level 85? paladin soloing dogs). Nothing hits hard enough to sustain 700k vengeance (easily attainable for a tot geared tank without even stacking stamina) and even if it did, the damage would kill you and you would have 0 vengeance.<br />

They know what they are doing... they are nerfing dps gain from intentional taking damage you are not supposed to take. In normal conditions you ll almost never reach vengeance cap and it ll have minimal impact on those tanks - they ll most likely still be in top5 in most of the encounters.<br />
<br />
It ll no longer be viable tactic to stack Anima Ring on your paladin tank or solo tank whole fight despite stacking debuffs. It is good change...</div></div><hr />

If you would actually read the thread regarding the topic on the official WoW tank forums, you would see actual problems with this change. On high damage fights i.e. heroics, it may be a really big problem. It is also a much unneeded change and will only result in stamina having a much higher value (it is already the highest value stat by far for Paladins at least), and average raid dps on heroic fights becoming lower.<br />
<br />
Tank DPS isn't free, ok? All fights are designed with the tank dps in mind. Blizzard alread said that. So if they lower tank dps, they'll balance/develop encounters for that.<br />
<br />
What they don't want are &quot;clever mechanics&quot; to have more tank dps than intended, wich also generally put unecessary strain on healers (and screw their fights intended for 2 tanks wich also make one class way better than others, since that class can solo tank while the others can't. They don't want this).<br />

That's exactly what they don't want. &quot;It's the healers problem! Not the tank for focusing on dps&quot;. &quot;My class can one tank the encounter designed for two tanks, suck it other tanks&quot;. Not every tanking class can gimmick tank (ops, solo tank, ok...).</div></div><hr />

Because it is a game - its competition. What the point to play DPS class if tanks do 1.5 more damage you do? If, as you say, paladin top meters while tanking, and also provide decent healing what the point to play different class then? Lets roll paladins everyone to fill all roles in raid - this is absurd. Let current specs\classes to fulfill their role. And dont worry about raid dps drop - I bet Blizzard will compensate this somehow.</div></div><hr />

I rarelly change my talents nowadays, basically only when changing between pve and pvp. Wich alread happened in the old system.<br />
<br />
For pve, they just promote that by simply designing the fights the same way. Everyone will always grab a talent for increased run speed instead of a talent to slow your targets if they don't give the chance to apply slow to the mobs in there for example. You go to the guides that they talk so bad about and you read often &quot;useless on this tier&quot;... great &quot;suggestions for talents are usually just breakdowns on how each one works and which ones work better in what situations&quot;...</div></div><hr />

We have had major resilience changes with every patch this expansion, and pretty much the same thing with vengeance.. They keep wasting their time changing the same crap back and forth instead of adding cool new things. Every time they made these changes, they say it will be ´better´.. and then 3 months later, they have to gut it again.<br />
<br />
The encounters team, and the quest team are the reason WOW is WOW.... the systems team is like a bunch of OCD idiots who can´t leave their own house because they have to check the stove every 3 seconds. How many cool new projects get pushed off the table because you guys can´t keep your hands off resilience and vengeance for more than a month?</div></div><hr />

I was always a fan of Omen and other threat meters where DPS had to gauge their threat and balance accordingly, while the tank really had to work at managing threat. However, I think Blizzard shot themselves in the foot because of current game mechanics and enrage times. It seems they make it so the enrage timer is so tight that tank dps is required to meet the enrage and DPS has to go full out without any regard of threat. To balance this out, they'll need to adjust boss mechanics again as well.<br />

I like the thought of the tank being a meat shield and not a dps powerhouse. That's my old school ways talking</div></div><hr />

That said, i don't see this as the solution. Not at all surprised that once again in this expansion, 10 mans get the short end of the stick.

the vengeance change is another stupid design decision, they should actually be beyond that after all these years *sigh<br />
no, the only fail decision was to let tanks do the same dps (or even much more under certain conditions) than any pure dps class. it's stupid, and that's what i thought the first time i saw it. maybe they should get rid of the tanking role completely if you want to be dps classes? would that be fun? would it be good for wow?</div></div><hr />

i'm with you there! i remember the good old times when you could measure the skill of a tank by how well he was able to hold aggro, especially on multi-target fights. it made the difference between &quot;everything under control&quot; and &quot;houston, we have a problem (and many dead dps+heal)&quot;. nowadays everything tanks have to do is spam their 400% boosted aoe abilities, topping the meters and not even look at threat - threat has become superflous. it was even more fun for me as a dps when i had to closely watch my aggro on the mobs. now i ignore it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These days sure you don't worry so much about threat once you have it, but you have so many more activate mechanics, movement, and well activate mitigation took cooldown use level to a whole new level, any good tank will tell you that the way tanking trended in wotlk and then in cata, was simply a snooze feast, i mean in cata it was a complete joke, all you had to do was worry about a tank cd here and there, and yes tank dps was behind but it wasn't overall important.<br />
<br />
Now its such a higher class of tanking, the skill gap between the good tank and the bad tanks is clearly obviously on every single level, if you want to stand there and be a meat shield go ahead, simply put you bad, i doubt your competing in heroic progression guilds, and if you are your probably holding the guild back because no smart player in there right mind would want to go back to the old style, tanking is a rush now, if the great tanks in classic and bc had a choice, they would hands down pick this style of tanking.<br />
<br />
if you wanted tanks to just be meat shields, hey lets not stop the idiocy there, lets make healers unable to do any sort of damage ability well in healing spec, heals only, and also lets remove all dps defensive cooldowns, they don't need them they are not meant to take damage, its the healers jobs to use cooldowns to save them not the dps..<br />
<br />
hell lets just go back to classic style of raiding, that shit was really hard..... no it wasn't it was great back then but in all honestly any smart player that raided back then will tell you , guess what it was nothing on the encounters made now, it was a hell of a lot more buggy and there wasn't exactly any complex rotation.<br />
<br />
ignorance is a great thing, many of the people in this thread have it and it ruins wow.<br />

they gave us vengeance to increase skill caps of tanks and make use viable in raids, we build our guilds, our raids around it, they change it now suddenly everything needs to be rebuilt and you are going to lose a massive chunk of tanks in wow.</div></div><hr />

Well for a while the initial goal was to make tanking easier in the threat department so that a new tank would not hold dps back and get more players tanking. That then left tanks with not much to do and Blizzard went hey how about we make tanks actively manage their avoidance and mitigation which then places more strain on healers if there is a new or not so skilled tank. It is less noticeable to the majority of the group if the tank sucks with active mitigation but make them responsible of threat and the whole raid knows. Blizzard can mask a problem but in the end someone still gets screwed =(</div></div><hr />

No? The butt-clinching threat issues of classic-BC is what made tanks so hard to find. If you enjoy always being near losing threat and potentially killing a DPS, then there is something wrong with you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
rather then giving tanks extra dps via a mechanic that encourage people to take damage, they should return to aggro multiplier based abilities. and balance fights around the fact you have 2 tanks in raid (btw, someone teach GC basic math please, 2/5 is not 1 to 4 (going by the standard 2 tanks 5 dps 3 healers 10 man usually is), and 2/17 is not 1 to 7 (going by, 2 tanks, 17 dps and 6 healers 25 man usually is)<br />
this will also solve the always present issue of tank swapping forcing the swapped tank to either stop dps or ask a paladin for salvation.<br />
<br />
as for the fights you can cheese with 1 tank, there are very easy solutions, make debuffs undispellable (horridon stacks should not be reset by paladin abilities, emperor's p3 debuff shouldn't be kitable to drop off etc), ensure that high stacking is extremly damaging (100% increments are not out of line), do more empress style debuffs (stack it too high and you'r out) just to give a few examples.<br />
<br />
tanking is fun, and people should enjoy tanking for the actual role (holding bosses and adds off healer and dps), if you want to top meters, you should roll dps.<br />
<br />

<br />
i played a tank since vanilla, i can tell you that i never lost threat to a dps with 2 brain cells at the beginning of the fight, and unless a boss had threat wiping mechanic i never lost threat afterwards.<br />
having a threat ceiling for dps was a good thing, it forced dps to use abilities in an intelligent manner rather then mash buttons as fast as possible and use mind numbing rotations, it made BC hunters and rogues pay attention (MD/tricks anyone?), it forced dps to actually pay attention and use their de-aggro abilities (when was the last time you saw a rogue vanish? mage invis? lock Soul shatter? hunter FD?) and it also forced tanks to work their abilities to maximize threat. these days if you manage to take aggro from a tank after the initial burst he's either DC or autoattacking and eating a sandwich (and even then, lol).</div></div><hr />

He was doing something very wrong there. I've been in raids where a prot pally would solo tank bats and the boss in a haste setup. Heroic Tortos, not normal. Or it's your healers failing to keep his shield topped off, or him failing to shield at the right times.<br />

I agree, but you might as well be talking to the wall.

If you fu**k up with tanks they will get less fun from the game, and again set more weight on the healers...

I am in a casual guild (10man raiding). But one of our main tanks will change to dps before 5.4, and we need to find a &quot;good&quot; tank before 5.4... How Blizzard? HOW?<br />

Threat should be generated by abilities rather than damage and there is really no need for tanks to dish out the amount of damage that they currently do, especially when they have countless panic buttons, defensive abilities and self healing in addition.<br />
<br />
Vengeance is a good thing for a few reasons:<br />
-It provides incentive for people to play Tank (it is still an underplayed role WITH vengeance). Without vengeance, there would really be no fun in tanking; you would do negligible dps on every fight and there wouldn't be very many little tricks that could be pull off to make a fight just that small amount smoother (since many rely on vengeance)<br />
-It provides extra survivability when it is needed. More attack power equals magnified absorption and self-healing effects. This really matters on tough fights. Removing vengeance will make many fights a lot harder, even undoable. I actually kind of wish they do it a lot so that people suddenly realize what good vengeance does for them.<br />
-The extra raid DPS matters. Think of all the fights where you beat the boss by only a few seconds; Imagine not having upwards of 100k or more extra raid DPS from one or both of the tanks. Once again, fights become a lot harder<br />
-It is a balancing factor for tanks. High-vengeance DPS levels put tanks well into the 100k range, but base DPS actually varies quite a bit between the classes. Prot paladins, for example, might seem to do well with their 100k dps or so, but at 0 vengeance, our DPS barely escapes the 20k range (hence why we are totally screwed out of Brawler's Guild and PvP, and why questing is an absolute pain). This puts us at a great disadvantage to other tanks, but vengeance effectively solves it by increasing our damage to such a point that the variation is negligible. <br />
<br />
<br />
what kind of a fail-comment is that? why not just triple the damage from &lt;insert dps class here&gt;? everyone in your raid would be MORE than happy, because the raid is getting ridicoulus amounts of free DPS!<br />
<br />
see what i did there?<br />
<br />
<br />
Your parable doesn't work, because if one DPS class suddenly did triple damage, they would be in much higher demand, and raid groups would be obliged to take 6 of them to cheese a fight. With tanks, the same effect does not occur because you cannot have a raid of 6 or so tanks, all with high vengeance. The damage will be focused on one tank, since the majority of vengeance on fights comes from the melee damage (boss melee damage is actually really high, but armor reduces most of it from the get go, and since vengeance is based on the unmitigated attack, most of it is from these melee hits). <br />
So, having one or two tanks in the raid doing high DPS is win-win, unless you are really egotistical. Your raid gets a lot of extra DPS on high damage fights, i.e. where it counts, and you can't exactly go in with 10 tanks, leaving everyone else out. So yes, when you see a tank doing very high dps, you should be very happy that your total raid dps is raised by a considerable margin. <br />
<br />
<br />
i'm with you there! i remember the good old times when you could measure the skill of a tank by how well he was able to hold aggro, especially on multi-target fights. it made the difference between &quot;everything under control&quot; and &quot;houston, we have a problem (and many dead dps+heal)&quot;. nowadays everything tanks have to do is spam their 400% boosted aoe abilities, topping the meters and not even look at threat - threat has become superflous. it was even more fun for me as a dps when i had to closely watch my aggro on the mobs. now i ignore it.<br />
<br />
See, this design really doesn't sit. Back in Vanilla wow, boss fights were incredibly simple by themselves; it was dealing with your own class mechanics that was the hard part. These days, design has shifted to dealing with an actually hard boss, using optimized class mechanics. This is a much better and more interesting design, in my opinion, because with the old design every fight in Molten Core and so on was essentially the same; waiting for sunder stacks, using threat drops on cooldown, etc. <br />
These days, the challenge in tanking does not stem from holding threat, but from where it really should be; managing incoming damage not only adequately, but optimally. This means swapping talents between fights, cooldown management, developing personal strategies for dealing with harder fights, keeping vengeance in mind when using particular abilities such as absorbs and heals, etc. If you think tanking these days is nothing but button mashing for free dps, you simply have not played tank, at least on harder fights. <br />
<br />
<br />
So, your concern is the extra dps the raid will lose, making encounter more difficult? Well I am sure they will balance it. Besides, not DPS gets more pressure to cover tank damage loss! Really no need to cry. UNLESS... you feel good being up there in the meters which makes you like the selfish DPS you are describing...<br />
<br />
I am really having trouble understanding some of what you are saying here: particularly &quot;Besides, not DPS gets more pressure to cover tank damage loss!&quot;. No offense, but please write this more coherently, I really cannot tell what you are trying to say.<br />
<br />
The balancing that will have to occur in response to this change simply emphasizes how unnecessary this change is; there are many cons, but pretty much no pros. All the balancing they would have to do would simply not need to be done if they didn't go ahead with the change, or if they made the caps at more reasonable values.<br />
It is quite a rubbish argument to say that we are the ones being selfish here; on most fights, we don't top dps anyway. It is kind of fun doing 140k dps or so, but I'm not overly proud of it because I know that I am getting it from vengeance; I am proud of doing 140k on my hunter because I know that is actually my own good execution of the class. I am simply saying that you need to look at this from the perspective of not individuals trying to down a boss, but a whole raid trying to. ANYONE doing very high dps should be seen as a good thing, as it means the boss fight will be smoother. DPS is DPS, whether a damage dealer or a tank does it. At the end of the day, the boss is being downed faster and no one should give a shit, but many DPS are that egotistical that they think potentially game-breaking changes should be undergone to prevent tanks from doing high dps on some fights. When you value your own DPS ranking more than the competence of a raid as a whole, you do not appreciate raiding properly and you should change your mentality regarding it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly! Stamina should have been higher in value! You are tanks. I am sick on seeing tanks hunting non-tanking stats in gear and still be effective. This is not normal. I understand that they made tanks gameplay more interesting by adding the active mitigation (was a DK tank before all this happen to the rest of the tanks) but they still overdid it. <br />
<br />
We have paladin tank in our guild that stacked haste like no tomorrow. We actually disenchanted any item with &quot;tanking stats&quot; on it! He even claimed priority on horidon's heroic trinket! You know... the haste one? Well, we reached tortos... and guess what? His haste setup was not that good against aoe tanking. And we could not use him there effectively. I can sure say that he can shove his precious dps gear up his ... a$$<br />
<br />
Severe misunderstanding of the paladin class. Haste has a very high value as a mitigation stat; we are NOT taking it because it gives us more dps. The DPS gain from haste is non-trivial at best. However, if you compare the relative values with respect to mitigation of all the stats, both haste and mastery come out on top BY FAR over dodge and parry, as does reaching the hit and expertise caps. This is why we are taking what is apparently 'dps gear'; the fact that we cannot bonus roll for the said gear, nor do we see the stats on our tier, doesn't mean it is not good gear for us. Blizzard, for whatever reason, doesn't want Paladins taking haste and excludes it from our tier and non-set epics, but if you take the initiative to actually compare the stat values and find out which is the most helpful, as some have, it is found that Blizzard is in fact wrong and you should be taking those pieces that you weren't intended to have. <br />
<br />
Haste has value as a tank stat because of three things: the talent Sacred Shield, and a passive ability called Sanctity of Battle, and the global cooldown<br />
-Sacred shield is a 30 second buff that provides an absorbing shield every 6 seconds, lasting 6 seconds or until the maximum amount of damage is absorbed. Haste increases the frequency of the shield application. At 18% haste, instead of the shield being applied every 6 seconds, it is applied every 4.6 seconds. This results in a greater overall net damage reduction from the absorption. Vengeance also incidentally increases the amount of damage absorbed. <br />
-Sanctity of Battle causes our haste to reduce our ability cooldowns; including our holy power generators (crusader strike/hammer of the righteous, and judgement). This gives us higher holy power generation, and thus a higher uptime of Shield of the Righteous. Shield of the Righteous is a 3 sec buff given by the spell of the same name (which requires 3 holy power to cast) which reduces our physical damage taken by 25% (which is further increased by mastery). <br />
-Haste reduces our global cooldown, once again resulting in greater holy power generation<br />
<br />
The result of higher haste is a smoother damage intake overall. This is in contrast with an avoidance build (the &quot;tank&quot; stats: dodge and parry) which results in a spikier, more unpredictable damage intake. As mentioned before, it all essentially revolves around Shield of the Righteous. This is the same reason why capping hit and expertise is one of our highest priorities, which is yet another reason to ignore avoidance gear. Your paladin tank was right for tanking the spark trinket (i also have the trinket) and the haste gear, and his inability to tank tortos is not due to the haste build. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tank DPS isn't free, ok? All fights are designed with the tank dps in mind. Blizzard alread said that. So if they lower tank dps, they'll balance/develop encounters for that.<br />
<br />
What they don't want are &quot;clever mechanics&quot; to have more tank dps than intended, wich also generally put unecessary strain on healers (and screw their fights intended for 2 tanks wich also make one class way better than others, since that class can solo tank while the others can't. They don't want this).<br />
<br />
I addressed the balancing thing earlier, but vengeance is not the reason why Paladins can solo tank many fights. All tanks get vengeance; the reason we can solo tank Horridon, Tortos, Durumu and Qon is because of how Shield of the Righteous works (we can time it for every stack application) and the fact that we can drop stacks with a quick bubble and cancel macro. <br />
<br />
Also, tanks standing in fires for vengeance rarely actually happens. A tank worth his salt would never do it on a fight where damage intake was already an issue, and otherwise it would only really be worth risking it if the tank knows that the healers are reliable and can guarantee survival. Surviving reliably is the absolute priority, but if we can reasonably and reliably sacrifice for a good amount of extra DPS, why not?<br />
<br />
Also, the vengeance cap with this change will be around 200k for most tanks. This is a level not usually seen, so tanks will STILL be standing in stuff on certain occasions to increase dps...the only way this really affects tanking is on harder, high-damage-intake fights where we DO see values of 200k. In other words, the change not only fails to address what it was intended to, but it also backfires and hurts tanks, and thus raiding, overall.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because it is a game - its competition. What the point to play DPS class if tanks do 1.5 more damage you do? If, as you say, paladin top meters while tanking, and also provide decent healing what the point to play different class then? Lets roll paladins everyone to fill all roles in raid - this is absurd. Let current specs\classes to fulfill their role. And dont worry about raid dps drop - I bet Blizzard will compensate this somehow.<br />

Here's an idea; ignore the tanks? The point of playing a DPS class is to play competently to assist in the killing of a boss. If you do 120k on say Megaera and the tank is down at 60k, you are doing good DPS. If we go to Durumu, and the paladin solo-tank is doing 140k but you are still doing 120k, you are still doing good dps . Why should we drag tanks down when they are doing nothing but helping the raid a little extra in high damage situations? To make the DPS feel better? <br />
If the current model of vengeance allowed for raids to be done with all prot paladins, people would already be doing it. There is a good reason it is not done, and I described it before. In a normal raid, the prot paladin has X average vengeance. With a raid of 10 prot paladins, one of those will have X average vengeance, and the other 9 will have minimal vengeance and thus minimal damage and healing. The huge majority of vengeace comes from melee attacks.</div></div><hr />
