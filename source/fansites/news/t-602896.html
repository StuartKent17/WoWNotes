Battlegrounds daily quests<br />
Seems that the 2000 Honor points on the AV Daily quest was indeed a bug .... It is now 4000. ^^<br />
Update : Eye Of The Storm too.<br />
<br />

Zul'aman<br />
You now need 5 players to start the even in Zul'aman. (as mentionned in this blue post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2518910681&amp;postId=25734110830&amp;sid=1#3))<br />
<br />
Also, more Zul'aman recolors, I guess it's pretty much complete, thanks to bas (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=1978.0) for his awesome post. <br />

Sound issues<br />
Hardware sound is back, I guess you should really connect on the PTR if you had sound issues before, and report on test realm forums if it's not resolved yet. <br />
<br />
<br />
Azure Whelpling<br />
As mentioned in the patch notes, you can now drop an Azure Whelpling on elite blue drakes in Azshara, we now have a nice screenshot of it, thanks to Bellacoro (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=1983.0)<br />

<br />
What Heroic Badges?? did I miss these because all i've seen are some Zulaman trinks and these. I thought these WERE the Badge of Justice trinkets.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quke</div><div class="date">2007-10-28, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So will you buy the trinket with 4k honor daily or 2 badges daily. That's 30/4~=8 days versus 75/2~=38 days!<br />
<br />
The new disc talent is just ridiculously good. Much better than Blessed Resilience which I think was the whole point of holy spec in pvp.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2007-10-28, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That 4k honor for the daily would be a good thing for several reasons.<br />
<br />
First, it makes arena more competitive by allowing a reasonably achievable base level of gear that everyone can acquire. The time requirement will still be comparable to that required playing arena to get this gear back in season 1 when it was some of the best gear in the game. <br />
<br />
Second, it makes some decent DPS gear available to a lot of players. This will allow a lot more guilds to progress beyond Kara without needing to farm it endlessly and allows for new members of existing guilds to gear themselves up a lot without needing the entire guild to keep farming Kara forever.<br />
<br />
Third, it gives casual players a chance to get some decent gear in an hour or two play a day.<br />
<br />
Fourth, it will get everyone doing a couple of BGs a day which can only be a good thing.<br />
<br />
Fifth, if you just do the daily quests you will have a bottleneck of getting the marks of honor now for your gear, at an average of about 30 marks per item you will still have to do about 15 bgs for each item, so probably looking at more like 3 bgs a day if you want your marks to keep up with your honor.<br />
<br />
And for anyone complaining remember that this is the entry level PvP gear now, and even if you just do the daily quest it will still take you about 50 days to get fully geared up.<br />
<br />
<br />
There must be some more changes coming for Retri paladins, otherwise there is very little reason for them to use judgements at all after this not to mention the complete end of retri healing in bgs or arena (not that it was common anyway but you could at least heal yourself to full between fights).<br />
<br />
P.S. For the no doubt incoming &quot;zomg, i grinded rank 14 before and it took 40 hours a week for 3 months and now this stuff is so easy to get&quot; allow me to pretort by saying you did that to get the top end gear, not the entry level gear. Full entry level gear was easily achievable under the old honor system and it should be under the current one.</div></div><hr />

Worse against Warrior, as you deny them rage with BR, but better against other classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not really, with decent resilliance crits are already doing 20% less damage to you, with this too crits will now be doing about 50% less damage to you which is basically the same as being uncrittable for the duration for crits that are at the 200% damage rate and much better for the 150% damage crits, plus you get a tasty healing recieved buff too so the new discipline talent is better overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does not stack with resilience.<br />
It does not reduce critical damage taken above 25% (with 3/3 you should gain 30% but you do not)<br />
It does only trigger of real critical hits, not of prevented critical hits through resilience (like all other three of our retroactive spells do)<br />
<br />
Hope they will fix/change it before the release of 2.3.</div></div><hr />

Do the new trinkets HEAL you for 1750 or really only increase the max hp by 1750?<br />
I'd say the tooltip is pretty clear but i heard people say it heals you...</div></div><hr />

8000 honor a day in an hour or so, that's really great.<br />
I have been farming honor for weeks, but due to my exams at school I can't play that much.<br />
I've made it to 26k honor in 3 weeks, that's barely enough for 2 season 1 arena items and without the BG daily quests I would have to farm for another 3 weeks to get more items.<br />
I do have the possibility to go to Karazhan with a raid group that has Karazhan on farm status. Free epics you could say, but I don't have the time to raid 3-4 hours a day.<br />
<br />
I do not say this often, but:<br />
Thanks Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

The trinkets look nice, now you don't need to raid to get something like Bloodlust Brooch. Cool!<br />
<br />
4k on Dailys really seems much, 2k honor was okay. But in general, it's good to see you don't have to farm for months to get a decent arena gear.<br />
<br />
And the greatest of all: Back to hardware sound, yay!<br />
In my opinion, the software solution was not well thought out. In my case, I've got a X-fi, it decreased my FPS, decreased my sound quality and introduced some bugs I didn't have before.</div></div><hr />

The daily battleground quest is once a day for a particular battleground, you won't get it for both EOTS and AV on the same day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does this mean that I can't choose for which BG I accept the quest?<br />
Like, day 1 has AV, day 2 has EotS, day 3 has AB, day 4 has WSG, then repeat.<br />
<br />
Or does it just mean that when I finish, say, the quest for EotS I will be unable to accept another BG quest?</div></div><hr />

A person that got the blue dragon got it on their 50th kill, mobs that are 1-2 shot. <br />

they do ban for afking in av, had my pally banned for 3 days and my druid for 3 hours, was well worth it, full veterans on both and got my new 70 druid 4/5 hwl's as well before i got banned.<br />
<br />
And on topic, just got off the ptr did one WSG for the pvp daily quest, got out of there with 198 honor(188 bonus honor for capping/winning) and turned quest in and its ~4300 bonus honor now. so yea looks like 4k a day</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that they added it to battlegrounds with a nice 4k honor reward it really is nice. It makes it much more interesting for casual pvp'ers like me and more hardcore players will see some faster rewards.<br />
It gets it a bit more up to speed with the arena rewards wich is a nice thing.<br />
<br />
I really hope they will keep going this course in WOTLK and keep the token system for instances too.<br />
Already cant wait for this patch.<br />

All thats left as icing on the cake is giving us more bank slots to buy.<br />

This and the Heroic requirement lessened would be a nice for any new face or reroll.<br />

Just because you don't enjoy bgs, doesn't mean everyone doesn't like them, and afk'ers did ruin AV or any bg for that matter(I've seen afk'er in warsong...); now it's not as half as bad a patch ago. Now people play AV, even if it's pve. <br />
<br />
Next patch is gonna kick so much ass, AV is back! and doesn't take 8 hours+!<br />
AND YOU KILL PEOPLE IN AV AGAIN! ;D</div></div><hr />

lol you're cool, if you think this current honor system is &quot;earning your gear&quot; you're mistaken. the honor system is just as flawed as the old rank system, one big time sink. Sorry I couldnt play 24 hours a day I have a job and a girlfriend. I never said what I did was right, and I certainly wouldn't do it again. I was looking for the easiest way to gear up and the opportunity arose. So i took advantage of it. I was adding something to the conversation, making a point, not flaming someone for no reason. As it stands right now, I'm capped on honor points and will be capped on arena points by the time season 3 hits, after I got all my gear I was at no honor and a new lvl 70 with no arena teams and that was in september. Sorry I dont enjoy completely sucking and would like to get decent arena ratings and enjoy playing. Because BG's for the most point are boring as hell. Especially when you play a healer.</div></div><hr />

No. They were renamed to &quot;Battlemaster's xxx&quot; as well. So shared cooldown.</div></div><hr />

Fail, my girlfriend plays a Holy Priest in BGs just fine, just got her second PvP mount today, she enjoys them.<br />
<br />
It is earning your gear, I wish the old grind still existed, even though it was a time sink it required dedication to earn your rank.<br />
<br />
I hate AFKers, I hate Botters, play the game, don't let some program play it for you, its the cheap way to do it, I don't care if you feel like it was a worthless part of the game and stupidly hard, it doesn't give you a right to bypass it by cheating while everyone else has to actually work for it.<br />
<br />
Btw, your point wasn't constructive on the conversation at all, and my senseless flaming wasn't senseless, it had a basis.</div></div><hr />

And I confirmed the ridiculous honor gain from the daily quest again. So it was somewhat constructive.<br />

Good for your girlfriends holy priest, still doesn't change the fact that BG's aren't the end game for PvP anymore, and I'm glad they're making it easier to get good gear from them. They should only be stepping stones to Arena not huge road blocks and time sinks. And for the most part running around with a bunch of scrubs and new 70's trying to cap flags isn't fun. Doing a couple wsg's and some av's today seeing how many people have 6k hp and lower is just ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

And fcuk'n hell they need to add more bgs, i've been doing the same 3 BGs for like 2 years now. Eye dosn't even count as a real BG, it's just AB in space with a crappy flag capping system and something for druids to do with the flag in the middle, the capping system works on like king of the hill type maps with one or two nodes, but not 4.</div></div><hr />

Adding new BGs reduces the amount of people playing each BG. Unlike the arena where it randomly selects a map and you have multiple maps for the same objective.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is more maps based on the same themes. Have multiple capture the flag maps, multiple AB style maps, etc. That way they could introduce more pvp maps without diluting the player base. <br />
<br />
The new daily BG quest is awesome. I was very excited about the 2k honor reward, now that it is 4k, that's even better! I have 3 level 70s and it is a huge pain to try and gear all of them up to play in the arena. I have a few pieces on all of my characters, but I would much rather have a system where everyone that does the arena has all of the honor pieces as a minimum. It sucks having a few crappy pieces on all my characters because I don't have the time to gear them out.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if there is a level requirement for these dailies? I may start leveling up one of my characters in the 40s and doing the daily bg with him every day so that he'll be ready to go for the arena as soon as he hits 70.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stormtang</div><div class="date">2007-10-29, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think what was said was, if you have a lvl 10 and its wsg day for the dailies you can get the quest. So i'm guessing the daily quest honor adjusts by your level. And to get certain one's you need to be able to enter that BG. 10 for wsg 20 for ab 51 for av 61 for eots</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normally the healer gloves have +2% crit on lesser healing wave (like on the picture for the old ptr)<br />
<br />
but the new ones have the Elemental bonus (+5 yards for shocks - on the picture for the new ptr)<br />
<br />
Maybe just a bug, which will be patched...</div></div><hr />

We wanted you to know that we're going to be redesigning the new discipline talent, focused will, so please hold off on providing further feedback on the ability until the new version is announced and/or it's pushed to the public test realms. The goal of the talent will still focus on survivability.</div></div><hr />
