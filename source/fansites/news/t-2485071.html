Tips Out Interview with John Hight and Omar Gonzalez<br />
Tips Out (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWrbtlKjqx4qijAYkDXLSA) sat down with John Hight and Omar Gonzalez on Classic.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
The beta will only have a small number of players, but there will also be the stress test weekend in which larger pools of players can log in.<br />
A new technology called Layering will be used to smooth the launch. It allows them to have multiple versions of each of the two continents running as needed. They are not cross realm and are only used so that an entire realm population isn't competing in one area at a time and to lessen login ques. The only way you can shift into a different layer is through party invites from others on your server who are in a different layer.<br />
The technology tries to sticky you to a layer so that you see familiar names often. It also only exists to control population at launch and will not continue once numbers are stable.<br />
The Classic servers will have new names to avoid confusion. <br />
They don't have an exact server number yet, but are flexible.<br />
In-game items from the Collector's Edition will be for retail only. They want to preserve Classic as it was.<br />
If you have the original Collector's Edition of Vanilla WoW on your account, you can re-access the pet rewards, but they are not re-releasing them to those who don't.<br />
There will not be tokens in classic WoW, but they will support realm transfer in Classic through the current in game service structure.<br />
They are going to take community feedback and how the community is progressing to figure out when to proceed with the content phases.<br />
Cross-realm PvP battlegrounds are included when they launch in Phase 3.<br />
You cannot add a person of the opposing faction to your B.Net friend's list by right clicking them in-game in Classic.<br />
If Classic is successful and the community wants it, other classic expansions could be on the table.<br />

Forbes Interview with J. Allen Brack<br />
Forbes sat down with J. Allen Brack (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2019/05/14/blizzard-entertainment-ceo-interview-on-priorities-wow-classic-and-diablo/#49c0c15f5bf3) to discuss Blizzard as a company and what is coming.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/may/thumb/forbesjallen.jpg (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2019/05/14/blizzard-entertainment-ceo-interview-on-priorities-wow-classic-and-diablo/#49c0c15f5bf3)<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard Changes and Leadership<br />
<br />
J. Allen Brack wants fans to know that the company has more in development than at any point in its history and their commitment to quality remains.<br />
Mike Morhaime stayed on in an advisory role to Brack and told him all the things he was doing wrong.<br />
They want the company to outlive all of them, and so it is only natural that at some point other people have to take over.<br />
Mike Morhaime continues to be very supportive of J. Allen Brack and the company.<br />
J. Allen Brack says the fact that two veteran Blizzard developers are now leading Blizzard should ease concerns that development has been overwhelmed by financial concerns in recent years.<br />
Their core mission of creating amazing games for players with a commitment to quality has not changed with leadership.<br />
<br />
Future Projects and Mobile<br />
<br />
There are core games in development for PC and console in addition to mobile initiatives.<br />
Skepticism of releasing games outside of PC has also occurred for titles such as Diablo III. It stems from people having pride in what their gaming platform is because they feel like the best games are on that particular platform. <br />
The desire to have a Blizzard-quality mobile experience has continued to increase in both Blizzard and fan's minds depending on age and how long you've had a mobile phone.<br />
Hearthstone on mobile was step one and this is step two. There will be other steps because they believe in mobile as a platform for gaming in the future.<br />
This does not mean that they don't believe in console gaming and PC gaming as a platform for the future. They do.<br />
Blizzard has been partnered with NetEase in China for almost 10 years, starting with World of Warcraft. They picked NetEase because the company is passionate for Blizzard IPs and shares the development-type culture. Diablo Immortal will be a Blizzard game and will use Blizzard values in monetization.<br />
There is a team of developers helping NetEase with the game. It's a partnership. They are not just having NetEase develop it in China and slapping the Blizzard name on it.<br />
Out-of-house outsourcing is not a strategic priority for Blizzard, but they have utilized it for other games such as StarCraft: Remastered.<br />
Blizzard's goal is to creature something great, whether it's with a current IP or an entirely new one.<br />
Something to work on is figuring out the challenges of having many different kinds of games in development to make intelligent decisions on the next steps for each project.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
DenofGeek Impressions and Interview<br />
DenofGeek also got to attend the Classic Event and shared their impressions (https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/blizzard/281116/world-of-warcraft-classic-preview-impressions) along with some information from Brian Birmingham, Lead Software Engineer, and Patrick Dawson, Production Director.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Blood Plague bug from Zul'Gurub has been brought up by the team and it would be interesting and funny to bring it back when Zul'Gurub launches in Phase 4.<br />
The original unarmored mounts from Classic were discussed, but ultimately it was decided not to bring them back in Classic because they didn't want to give players the incentive to rush through the leveling experience.<br />
In game reporting will be in the game, but there will be a human element to it and not just automatic bans based on an algorithm.<br />
The team felt it was important to make it easy to report abusive players, but understand the drawbacks of this system. If you feel you have been actioned inappropriately, you can reach out to customer service.<br />
When asked if new level 60 content after Naxxramas could be developed, such as new 40 man raids, the team said anything is on the table and this is a love letter to fans. If the fans desire it, it will be considered. There are no plans as of now, but that bridge will be crossed when they get there. (*Note that in the GameReactor Interview, Ion says new content is out of the question for Classic)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
USGamer Interview<br />
USGamer also interviewed (https://www.usgamer.net/articles/wow-classic-building-old-ideas-on-top-of-new-foundations) Brian Birmingham and Patrick Dawson. They had a small amount of new information.<br />
<br />
<br />
They start from Patch 1.12 because it was the most complete version of the game. Bugs that are not gameplay affecting exploits are back in the game. There's no reason to take UI conveniences out and make things inconvenient just for the sake of inconvenience as long as they're capturing those core gameplay features: spells and abilities, old quests, and that aesthetic feel of the game.<br />
The developers also stated that there are no plans for a content loop, with the Classic reverting to the first content phase after some time at the sixth phase. What happens after Naxxramas is unknown.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
GameReactor WoW Classic Interview<br />
GameReactor also got to ask a few questions (https://www.gamereactor.eu/articles/763353/World+of+Warcraft+Classic+Our+View+from+the+Summit/) while at the WoW Summit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ion Hazzikostas and Calia Shie both explained how changes to the overall concept and the addition of new content were out of the question since once altered that would make a Classic server something else entirely. (*Note that the DenofGeek interview says new content could be possible if the fans want it.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not about platform pride, its about different types of game. Can't have game with more than couple of buttons on mobile. People who like dumb games already play on mobile. People who prefer more advanced games play on PC. Announcing mobile game in room full of PC gamers has nothing to do with platform pride, it has everything to do with Blizzard speaking to wrong audience.<br />
<br />
Platform pride is when people talk about playing WoW on Windows vs Mac. That nonsense is real platform pride because game itself is identical.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has been the question I've been waiting to hear an answer to for some time. While I don't want them to extend their hand and have their arm torn off I hope that this will allow them to gracefully extend these classic experiences in to TBC and WotLK. I'm not crazy about vanilla but if they were to bring out a TBC server then that would be incredible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think new content might be possible on a separate server - classic would be classic, but classic + or some shit could happen if it were so insanely and wildly popular.<br />
<br />
I highly doubt it'd be that popular though to create an entire development team to create -new- content for classic. If it were a osrs vs rs3 situation like so many have assumed itll be (It won't, pls stop comparing the two, rs3 was wildly unpopular, classic wasn't even peak wow popularity) then they'd prob move devs from the wow team to the &quot;classic +&quot; or whatever they'd call it.<br />
<br />
But once again, highly doubt that bridge gets crossed. <br />
<br />
We'll know within 30-60 days of launch what we're looking at w/ classic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are dedicated pet collectors who'd love these rewards.<br />
Those pets would not go to your main WoW characters, but to your Classic WoW characters. Those pets won't show in your pet collection tab on the main WoW game.<br />
<br />
It's highly unlikely pet collectors would be playing Classic WoW to collect pets.</div></div><hr />

I seriously hope this is not what I think it means. T_T I like Classic and look forward to the more slow-paced, relaxing gameplay, but sixty levels without a mount?<br />

<br />
Because they were the ORIGINAL Collector's Edition items. In fact, for the longest time, you only got to have a single one of them on each character.<br />
<br />
Making them available again -- by any other way than buying the original CE -- would just be a massive slap in the face to fans to picked the original CE up. I'm one of them, and I had to jump through a *lot* of hoops to secure mine when the game first launched. I also managed to score a Mini-Tyrael from a contest I'd entered when they were coming out, and I would be legit pissed if they just threw it up on the cash-shop.<br />
<br />
I think, if Blizzard were to make them available in some other capacity, they would have to be willing to say &quot;Okay, we're going to make EVERYTHING in the game available in some capacity, no more &quot;retired&quot; items anymore&quot;.<br />
<br />
Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I would be upset about losing exclusivity on some things, but probably excited to be able to get other things (ie. some of the MoP Challenge Mode sets of Legion Mage Tower appearances, or past PvP mounts and Elite sets).<br />
<br />
The thing is, Blizzard would have to be incredibly consistent, because that would be setting a pretty wild precedent. It's Blizzard's call to make, but the important thing is they could *NEVER* double-back on that commitment. So, it's pretty unlikely to ever gain any traction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. They're either sticking their heads in the sand or they're purposely ignoring the actual issue people had with it. It wasn't about a mobile game, it was advertising a mobile game to PC gamers. It be like going to an Xbox convention and advertising a Playstation exclusive; you're going to have a bad time.<br />
<br />
<br />
My biggest issue with the interviews though was this line: Diablo Immortal will be a Blizzard game and will use Blizzard values in monetization.<br />
<br />
Hasn't it already come to light that this was just a reskin of another game or were those just rumors? Haven't there been leaked screen shots that show the extremely aggressive monetization they're going for with the Chinese market?<br />
<br />
Here, they're claiming it to be a Blizzard game with Blizzard values in mind towards monetization. Frankly, I can't wait to see just what their current values are when it comes to said monetization, because I can't see them being good. We'll know for sure if Blizzard is still a company that leans towards it's old values of customers first or if the new leadership has moved towards stock holders first, consumers second. Time will tell, and Diablo will be a major contributor in telling that story.</div></div><hr />

Ha don't make me laugh, people wanted Hearthstone on Mobile because it fit as well as a quick way to deal with their Garrison and that was it. No one has been clamoring for Starcraft, Overwatch or Diablo on a phone and even less WoW in it's entirety.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hearthstone on mobile was step one and this is step two. There will be other steps because they believe in mobile as a platform for gaming in the future.<br />

I wouldn't laugh if we had like, holographic interfaces and haptic feedback systems that are projected from your phone, so you can have a 'full' gaming experience. As it is, with a touch screen that has very limited inputs, and is blocked partially by you doing things? I don't see it as a very good platform at all.

Its not about platform pride, its about different types of game. Can't have game with more than couple of buttons on mobile. People who like dumb games already play on mobile. People who prefer more advanced games play on PC. Announcing mobile game in room full of PC gamers has nothing to do with platform pride, it has everything to do with Blizzard speaking to wrong audience.<br />
<br />
Platform pride is when people talk about playing WoW on Windows vs Mac. That nonsense is real platform pride because game itself is identical.<br />
<br />
This scared me. No one can look at keyboard/mouse+ 3840x2160 monitor and claim it's somehow comparable to small, touch-screen mobile interface. Add the ability to update your hardware and the freedom of controlling your OS more, and PC gaming is in another league.<br />
<br />
I'd be totally placated if he had said, &quot;Mobile is another platform that can have amazing games, and we have some great ideas that are specific to mobile.&quot; That makes sense. But his actual answer means he's either delusional or he's being fed a line from The Board to justify mobile gaming.</div></div><hr />

It won't be long until your phone is as powerful as a gaming desktop and you can just connect to monitors and a keyboard and play games. Not to mention the whole game streaming thing which keeps getting better. Consoles are just off the shelf PCs already.<br />

Some quick thoughts regarding the two guys I talked to saying more level 60 content is possible and Ion saying the opposite.<br />
<br />
1. Ion is the lead dev and I suspect he's probably focused on keeping the player base focused on the current version of Classic instead of what may or may not happen two or more years from now.<br />
2. The devs I spoke with, Brian and Patrick, did seem very sincere about the option being on the table, but they didn't say anything like &quot;we're definitely going to do it.&quot; It's just a long-term possibility, just like BC or Lich King servers.<br />
3. As someone else already pointed out, I could see both stories being accurate in the long-run. Blizzard will never make changes to the Classic servers that are going live in August, but could release an updated server that you can copy your character to and that one will get new level 60 content, etc.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents.</div></div><hr />

There are dedicated pet collectors who'd love these rewards. You were able to get old collector's edition rewards a few months ago when Blizzard had an old game sale...so why can't they bring them back for the 15th anniversary? It's dumb.<br />

If they want to lose their entire audience in the West and all the good will they've garnered for over two decades, sure. However, if they realize that this is a bad idea, and that tearing your roots up to try and milk some far-flung profits isn't wise, then they'll try to find a balance.<br />

It clearly has a market in Asia, at least, and probably in Blizzard's other major market areas as well. I mean, don't get me wrong, I was outraged as hell when they announced it, but that was mostly because they'd teased Diablo 4 so much, and then got on stage at the freakin' keynote, as the final reveal in the presentation...and then handed us a mobile knockoff of D3 that really amounts mostly to a Blizzard-themed reskin of an existing mobile game. My outrage was almost exclusively confined to how, where, and when they decided to reveal the game, not the game itself. The game is clearly a good business move, and the fact that they are largely outsourcing development is also a good sign, in my mind, since it clearly shows they aren't pivoting their overall company strategy towards mobile games (at least, yet).</div></div><hr />

Uh huh, that's why people were also butthurt about Diablo 3 on consoles right? Because consoles are known to be P2W?<br />
<br />
And who really cares if there is a P2W mobile game coughHearthstonecough that funds future development of Warcraft content?<br />
<br />
it doesn't though. It funds the shareholders poor empty pockets, and the games are massproduced crap aimed at the chinese market. If we are talking about money that funds future warcraft content, Blizz already has ALL the money from previous years of earnings. Nobody cared about diablo on consoles because it was mainly a pc game that got grinded to death when it was first released. And this was the shittiest form of a straw man argument. DI will be a mobile ONLY game aimed towards communist china. D3 was mainly pc, expanded to the other consoles way after it's release. And who cares? People that enjoy Blizz content on PC. Who doesn't care? Blizz, because mobile is more profitable due to less regulations, the mobile popularity in Asia and the ease of development towards mobile. <br />
<br />
And you might have read the text with rose colored glasses. They are aiming more towards the mobile market because of the untapped chinese market, and for funding more mobile content. Not warcraft content. If you want to dream, sure, go ahead and dream, and write walls of text defending blizz against any and all arguments with dreamy garbage not based on reality or facts but rather emotions, delusions and unicorn rainbow farts. But unless you can see a company for what it is, or what a company's main goal is, you should probably read up and get a reality check first before writing walls of text. Don't @ me.</div></div><hr />
