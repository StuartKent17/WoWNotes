Battlemasters and collision 
If you're playing on a high population server it probably already happened to you, you can't click the battlemaster to join a BG because this stupid tauren decided to stay on it. Well, it's fixed in 2.4 ! 
In 2.4, the Battlemasters are standing on platforms with collision around them.

We're also working on a better solution for Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guild bank items price<br />
A cool feature could be added to the guild bank : letting the guild master set prices for specific items to let members buy them from the guild bank.<br />
We've been exploring ideas about letting guild masters set prices for items from the guild bank. We hope to get some cool guild bank improvements in over time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Titles in Wrath of the Lich King<br />
Tigole explains how titles will be used in the expansion.<br />
We want titles to be meaningful in WoW and not commonplace. Our goal is to release more titles sparingly, so that the titles carry weight with other players. We do have a lot of plans for some new systems incoporating titles in Wrath of the Lich King. More information will be coming out on that soon.<br />
<br />
Also, we feel like we have to be careful about rewarding people for behavior that might not be the best game experience. As much as everyone loves killing Murlocs, I feel like I have a moral and social responsibility not to encourage you to grind out 10,000 Murloc kills.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lake Wintergrasp and server-wide buff<br />
Controlling the Lake Wintergrasp (the new outdoor PvP zone introduced in WotLK) might give a buff to your whole faction regardless of their location.<br />
Q: Why can't you make it so that cities like Halaa (well, pick another one, not Halaa) give a server wide buff to players, if it is controlled by your faction?<br />
A: That's a cool idea. Maybe we'll do something like that with Lake Wintergrasp.<br />

Vaneras posted a short message to confirm that Blizzard employees are still reading the official feedback threads created a few weeks ago to discuss class balancing in the expansion.<br />
I would just like to remind people that you can still post your feedback (be it positive or negative) in the 'Class Feedback Requested' thread: Class Feedback Requested<br />

German player reaches gold limit - 214,748 Gold<br />
I received TONS of mails about this and I guess it's worth a news. A german player reached the gold limit on live servers, and had to contact a gamemaster because he couldn't loot the gold in his mails anymore ... You can see the conversation with the gamemaster (in german) in this screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/goldlimit.jpg), basically the GM just says that there is no way to bypass the limit and he should just transfer money to his alts. ^^<br />
<br />
According to a few posts on various forums (including this one (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=3637.msg33282#msg33282), it's the maximum amount of gold because the developers decided to use a signed 32-bit integer for gold, the first bit being 0 means that the number is positive.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, that's the not the first case of a player reaching the gold limit on a live server, it already happened a few months ago when a player on US realms reached it - see this screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/691k3KN.jpg) from Blood Legion (http://bloodlegion.com/), the limit is definitely 214,748 gold)<br />
<br />
<br />

This is incorrect. The screenshot was on live servers from early October.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GM: I'm a game master, RP shit, Do you have a moment to discuss your ticket about the gold limits?<br />
Player: Hello, Yeah, i have time.<br />
GM: You have reached the gold limit?<br />
Player: No idea.<br />
Player: Is there such a thing?<br />
Player: I can't recieve gold from my mail or anything.<br />
GM: Then you have found (The gold limit?). You have surprised the other gamemasters. (This sentence is tricky)<br />
Player: Sucks, I'm in an In-game Millionare.<br />
GM: (The first part explains why gold caps, something to do with the numbering system), But you should just distribute your gold amongst characters.<br />
Player: Thats what i figured i'd do.<br />
GM: Is there anything else i can help you with?<br />
Player: No thanks. Now i know thats not a bug though. Thanks for the help.<br />
GM: Have a great day, glad to be of help, etc.<br />
Player: thanks</div></div><hr />

There was originally a guild member cap back in the days of 1.x. It was first hit by an old guild named Clan Ironfist on the Kilrogg-US server. Blizz had to do the exact same thing they did with gold to guilds, remove a cap they didn't even realize they had programmed.<br />
<br />
How's that for funny. I wonder what cap, known or unknown, we'll see next.</div></div><hr />

And a more direct (line-by-line) translation:<br />
<br />
&lt;GM&gt; [gm] Hello [name], I'm Gamemaster [gm]. Sorry to disturb you, do you have time to talk about you ticket concerning the gold limit.<br />
[name] Hello<br />
[nane] Yeah, I have time<br />
&lt;GM&gt; [gm] So, you have reached the gold limit?<br />
[name] No idea<br />
[name] Is there such a thing?<br />
[name] I can't get gold from mail and vendors anymore<br />
&lt;GM&gt; [gm] The error message you got, states that you have. have you tried to mail some of the gold to another character?<br />
[name] Yeah, that works<br />
[name] What puzzles me is the funny numer<br />
[name] number<br />
&lt;GM&gt; [gm] Then you have found a solution to bypass the limit. Incidentally, you've astonished a few game master.<br />
[name] : D<br />
[name] bugger, wanted to become an in-game millionaire^^<br />
&lt;GM&gt; [gm] The odd number is probably because the gold value isn't stored in decimal numbers. But it's just a personal guess.<br />
[name] Thought so<br />
&lt;GM&gt; [gm] Can I help you with anything else?<br />
[name] No thanks. Now I know it wasn't some bug. Thanks for your help<br />
&lt;GM&gt; [gm] Then I wish you a good day [name]. And good luck in your future trades.<br />

Probably good programming practice or because they want to avoid flaws/bugs because of that. But i guess they will raise the limit now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To anyone who thinks this is an insurmountable problem right now: access the battle master by showing its nameplate and right-clicking that instead. I think default is CTRL+V. Nameplates always show up in the foreground and cannot be obstructed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since a signed integer only goes as high as 2,147,483,647 (2^31 - 1) it goes to -2,147,483,648 though. I suspect you are off by 1c on your upper limit.</div></div><hr />
