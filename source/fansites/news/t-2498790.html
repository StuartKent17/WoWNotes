We’re working on a change to the Arcane Heart Azerite Trait that was introduced in Rise of Azshara. How it works today is: 
 
Arcane Heart gives you a buff for every 1.5 million damage or healing you do. However, damage or healing that comes from something other than you casting a spell is not counted. For example, a Blood Death Knight doing healing from Death Strike isn’t benefitting from that healing counting to the next proc of Arcane Heart.

We’re working on a change to the Arcane Heart (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/303006-arcane-heart) Azerite Trait that was introduced in Rise of Azshara. How it works today is:<br />
<br />
Arcane Heart (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/303006-arcane-heart) gives you a buff for every 1.5 million damage or healing you do. However, damage or healing that comes from something other than you casting a spell is not counted. For example, a Blood Death Knight doing healing from Death Strike isn’t benefitting from that healing counting to the next proc of Arcane Heart.<br />
<br />
So we’re developing a fix for that. Currently, the change looks like this:<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
Arcane Heart (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/303006-arcane-heart)<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that caused some damage and healing effects to go uncounted by this Azerite Trait.<br />
Damage and healing counted to activate Omnipotence is no longer counted while Omnipotence is active.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The second change there is needed to keep this from being a big buff for a Trait that we feel is fairly well-balanced before we make the bugfix.<br />
<br />
If all goes well, we expect to bring this fix to the game with maintenance this week (tomorrow for Americas realms, and thereafter for EU and Asian realms).</div></div><hr />

<br />
this patch has been badly designed, badly tested and just bad all around... just get BFA over with so we can go to the dragon isle already</div></div><hr />

<br />
What?! The trait is shit. It gets better the more dps you do but it is still not very good. I would not call it fairly well-balanced.</div></div><hr />

I think their idea is to take it with specs like blood dk, affliction etc. which have a lot of selfheal. But its still a bad trait, especially with the added &quot;cooldown&quot;.<br />
<br />
But i think at this point we should be aware that blizzard explanation why they do things should never taken seriously. They always give some questionable reasons, that often don't make any sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's in the bottom half of shadow priest traits, to the point where even mediocre options like Death Throes will beat it out. It's basically terrible for every boss that isn't Azshara, and even for her there are likely better options.<br />
<br />
The only good output on AEP specific traits is coming from Undulating Tides which itself is a sim trap. Due to the shield portion putting the damage output on cooldown, and the shield proccing so often on progression you're unlikely to actually be able to take advantage of the trait fully.</div></div><hr />
