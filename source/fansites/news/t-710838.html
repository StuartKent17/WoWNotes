<meta name="description" content="Lil'XT Sounds Hotfix 
A hotfix was recently applied, which temporarily disabled some of the sounds Lil’ XT makes. 
 
The issue was that some of his sounds were flagged in such a way that they play for everyone around him and not just the player that owns the pet, an annoying problem to be sure. We can’t alter volume or who the sounds play for through a hotfix so the temporary workaround is to disable them completely right now until the proper fix can be patched in later.

Why do people keep saying that? I don't get it at all. Did the goblin somehow eat the worgen, despite being &quot;eaten&quot; first or what? And the new combo is called a &quot;woblin&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The Worgen bit the Goblin and it had a werewolf-like effect, turning the Goblin into a Worgen-Goblin, or as it stated, a Woblin.<br />
<br />
Everything's funnier when you have to explain it.<br />
<br />
P.S. I bought XT to entertain me and my fellow raiders. I hope they fix and reapply the sound soon.</div></div><hr />

The issue was that some of his sounds were flagged in such a way that they play for everyone around him and not just the player that owns the pet, an annoying problem to be sure.

<br />
Please reread this section: If I have my friendly pet sounds turned on I should be able to hear the non-combats also.<br />
<br />
It should be a choice, personally I like the sounds all the non-combats make and think they give the game flavor. Don't make the mistake of thinking your preference applies to the entire playerbase.<br />
<br />
Update: I just found this on another site, I was not aware the player could trigger the sounds instead of them happening automatically like Lil'KT/Panderan/all others. Players should not be able to grief others like this, however I still stand by my wanting the automatic sounds to be heard by everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the Lil-XT, the player owning it could click on the pet and entire lines of dialgoue (which are HELL annoying when done over and over again) play to EVERYONE in the area.</div></div><hr />

Plus, XT is one of the most memorable things from Ulduar (albeit most of you probably haven't done it because you're all bad). I remember first pulling him, the entire raid was just like &quot;wat...&quot; Good times... Good times... Better than ICC at least.</div></div><hr />

Please don't mute him! This was the main reason I bought him...I love how annoying he is. If people just can't stand it, turn the volume down, limit the range, just don't mute him. If you do mute him, you must offer refunds!<br />

I also have a future request for a pet. I want a Professor Putricide! I want him to walk around saying - &quot;Good News Everyone!&quot;. Either of these is better than that stupid train set.</div></div><hr />

Let us buy a pet that makes funny sounds, then mute it three days later because people are too lazy to mute their sound, or QQ that it's annoying.<br />
<br />
GG.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because I should totally have to mute ALL sound effects until the next patch because they accidentally made XT's noise global instead of private. It's not an issue of laziness, it's that it's so incredibly annoying. <br />
<br />
It would've been fine if people hadn't abused it, but once again the WoW populace proves why we can't have nice things.<br />
<br />
This thing was more annoying than the toy train set, and it's a good thing it's been disabled until fixed.</div></div><hr />

The pet is significantly worse than the train. Plus the train has a smasher. The sound was never meant to be heard by everyone.<br />

To all, you can not complain about the fairness of paying $10 for a pet and then being denied the ability to annoy everyone by saying well oh they can just mute all of their sound. What makes you so special?</div></div><hr />

Yes, but only to your speakers, so it's true I do not fear.<br />

<br />
I can't quite see what your getting at. You are mad they removed the global sound that annoyed EVERYONE else. You can still hear it, you just can't annoy others with it. <br />
<br />
If you are mad at this patch it means one of two things:<br />
<br />
1) You spent $10 so you could annoy the fark out of everyone else by spamming Dal. <br />
<br />
2) You spent $10 and wanted the sound draw the attention of others around you. So when you are in a raid or sitting in Dal you are essentially screaming over their speakers &quot;LOOK AT ME, I GOT A BETTER PET THAN YOU&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I honestly can't see any other reason why you would be upset about this patch. Like I said, you can still hear the voice so whats the problem to you? Clearly its one (or both) of the 2 reasons listed above. And if you really did buy XT for that reason you should be ashamed of your shallowness and your disregard for the respect of others.</div></div><hr />

i think people are upset that they can't be intentionally annoying with it anymore. it says in big blue letters on the main page that the sounds will be patched in once the bug is fixed. if you bought it because of how obnoxious it was then you should have seen it coming.</div></div><hr />

Yes and your point? Me and my friends get a kick out of it when it destroys a train set and we all laugh. And since they don't have one, all it is a a basic pet. Point being, who gives a crap why I bought it, don't sell me one thing and then change it and expect me to be ok with it.</div></div><hr />

Lord almighty people. I think i saw two posts regarding Class info. There is no fire big enough for the people whining about this crap to die in(Both those for the change and against). There just isn't. <br />
<br />
Anyways, anybody else notice the lack of new info on the links/official forums? I know i didn't see anything including Solar Beam or ToL CD in there, what about the other classes?</div></div><hr />

This is awesome, and I pair my Lil' XT with http://www.wowhead.com/item=35223 and people love it. Also when he blows up other players mechanical pets, it's a rather large and bright explosion that still annoys most people.</div></div><hr />

They're not changing the sound you muppet they're making it so only you can hear it so we don't have to hear your whiney little spawn whenever we wander by you.</div></div><hr />

After 4 seconds the mushroom becomes invisible. Enemies who cross the mushroom detonate it, causing it to deal area-of-effect damage, though its damage component will remain very effective against single targets. The druid can also choose to detonate the mushroom ahead of time. This is primarily a tool for the Balance druid, and there will be talents that play off of it. No cooldown. 40-yard range. Instant cast.<br />
