The acheivement itself never awarded master riding. Mounting the drake for the first time did if you already had 280%.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, that's true - Think they're just cleaning up the wording on the achievement but still granting master riding upon mounting the purple proto-drake?</div></div><hr />

Yeah I hope that as well. It was helpful some level 90's 2 seater flying mounts to help the cinematic to go off. Every time I tried to fly off and come back to start it I would 132.</div></div><hr />

It hasn't changed but the tooltip has been clarified to show that only brewmasters/windwalkers can dual wield.. the old tooltip didn't specify so you didn't know you couldn't dual wield as a mistweaver without trial and error.</div></div><hr />

I've been following the rogue patchnotes aswell as logging into the beta and check the things by myself. But I still want some love for my class, and by love I mean something related to lazers or sharks and explosions.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I mean on my comment is that there are quite a few posts where I dont see not a single number tweak or something related to rogues. I'm wondering if the rogue is really the easiest class to balance or adjust or the devs were geniouses when they developed it since it doesnt need any fix nor anything.<br />
<br />
I will be sad if rogues turn out to be crap on MoP, since that they had a bunch of time to tune the numbers prior the expasion, but they inversted those resources (time, people) on different things.</div></div><hr />

the model/frame is old, the skin is new. So you're both wrong.</div></div><hr />

You don't seem to know what a model is, if it equals frame to you.</div></div><hr />

They look pretty damn new to me. None of the previously introduced Sha models have that head ornamentation, and the Mantids have different suits of armor on.<br />
<br />
Are we in need of a redefinition of what a &quot;new model&quot; is? You slap some armor on an old night elf saber cat? Yep, that's a new model.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The skin is not equal to the model. The skin is the two dimensional... lets say texture.... that would wrap around an otherwise colorless model. Something is only a &quot;reskin&quot; of something else if the model's previous texture can be interchanged with the new reskin without any graphical snafus. <br />
<br />
The proper term you were looking for is that the skeleton is reused. The set of animations used by the creatures is indeed shared.<br />
<br />
However, Blizzard has been doing this since well before Mists of Pandaria or Cataclysm. They did it in Wrath of the Lich King, and they did it in Burning Crusade. So it's nothing to bitch about.</div></div><hr />

I think that in two-three weeks we should see MoP pre-load for 5.0 on the launcher. 5.0.4 is likely lauching September 11th the latest as I believe they've said it will be out for two weeks before the expansion. That should give people with slower connections or bandwidth cap a grace period to download their digital purchase prior to launch of pre-expansion patch and most of the expansion data.<br />

No. They are completely removing the master riding skill from both achievement and mount. So if you're wanting 310% for your alts now, you will have to either complete the entire meta-achievement on that character or shell out the gold to obtain the mount flying speed.<br />
<br />
Very unfortunate for altoholics. :/</div></div><hr />

I sure hope they are not serious. I was looking forward to using that ugly proto-drake when the patch hits on live. Sigh.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pvrwizard</div><div class="date">2012-08-03, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone actually tried mounting the Proto drake on beta with 280 riding skill and seeing what it does? they changed the wording on the acheivement, which never actually gave the riding skill.. you got the riding skill change when you actually mounted the drake the first time. so far this is simply a tooltip change until someone actually tries mounting the drake for the first time on a character that has 280% riding or a blue actually confirms that this is something more than a tool tip change. I don't really care if alts get the riding skill. I am 2 very small acheivements away on my main. unfortunately i can't complete one until brewfest and the other until winter veil. I only really started working on the acheivment this year and *shudder* fot that damned PVP one done for childrens week this year. as long as My main gets it great</div></div><hr />
