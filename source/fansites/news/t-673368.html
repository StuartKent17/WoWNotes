They grow back inside your head, since trolls have enough free space in their heads *snicker<br />

Warlocks always had the &quot;weird&quot; look but thats fine because there warlocks..

Umm idk what you're using as reference for the penis part of the &quot;penishead&quot;, but if yours looks anything like that spike growing from Hunters' foreheads... you might want to get it looked it...<br />

<br />
I have to agree. The Warrior tier 10 gear just looks plain bad ass, with the simplicity of the colors and clever use of contouring. Also, the color they chose for the particle effects in the shoulder doesn't clash with the other versions of the set, unlike the Death Knight ones.<br />
<br />
The gold/yellow and the green/yellow combinations are my favorite.</div></div><hr />

The sets are neat, especially rogue and hunter but the Dk one looks just like every other dk set... black, some runes, some skulls, done...<br />

<br />
Almost agree with you on the DK set; The set looks better than the rest of the DK sets (even if it's pretty standard), but what makes it great in my book is the shoulderpads not being identical. I just hope the helmet won't be a complete aesthetic failure.<br />

I am not sure what they were smoking or drinking when they decided on those designs but they take ugly to a whole new level - it was mentioned that it looks like some one was mugging glists for their cloths but even they have better dress scense then to wear something that looks like this. I can only thank the powers that be that there is a feature to hide the helm I only wish you could hide the shoulders too. Why is it the DK's have such slick looking gear - rogues should look like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Tauren Warrior look makes me want to start a warrior though. LoL</div></div><hr />

Maybe Shaman will get some good looking gear now.</div></div><hr />

If they are going to go for a darker look and introduce something like a death knight then go for the dark look and don't dance around the issue trying to keep the kiddies happy.<br />
<br />
Besides most kids I know would wear a set of shoulders with skulls spiked on them even if the rest of the model looked like balls anyway.<br />
<br />
Also http://mythicmktg.fileburst.com/media/images/newsletters/warhammer/2007/NL-Chosen001.jpg and http://warhammerinfo.com/img/art-sorcerer01.jpg would look awesome I mean would it hurt blizz to implement some more interesting looking armor like this?<br />
<br />
Afterthought.... the caster armor would probably reduce the population of male toons quite a bit ;D<br />

<br />
Not entirely unfitting but the rest of the set does not fit the mask. I of course even knowing the point behind it still do not care for it. I personally liked tier 8 for rogues. I thought it looked awesome but no one seemed to agree with me.</div></div><hr />

Come on Blizz, what, did you get rid of the real artists?? Funny how most of the plate wearing classes armor looks too similar and when should Rogue and Mage armor look more like plate?? Get with the program and put some effort into the concept art work please.</div></div><hr />
