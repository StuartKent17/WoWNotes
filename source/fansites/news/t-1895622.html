Welcome to our World of Warcraft: Legion class preview series. In this entry, we’re exploring the Hunter—to find out what’s in store for a different class, check out the overview.<br />
<br />
We begin our early look at class and specialization design with the Hunter. In these blogs, we’ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion’s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization—laying out a foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let’s delve into what it means to be a Hunter in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
In many ways, Hunter design in Legion embodies our key philosophies for class change. Hunters have a strong “core fantasy”: they’re masters of tracking prey, experts at sniping enemies with bows and guns from a distance, tamers of wild beasts, and trappers of unsuspecting foes. The challenge with the Hunter class in WoW is that, for the most part, while all three specs deliver that basic fantasy, the distinction between them is fairly minimal. In Legion, we’re focused on better differentiating these specializations to deliver more dynamic and varied experiences.<br />
<br />
Beast Mastery<br />
Among the most gifted hunters, there are those who have from birth felt a profound bond with the creatures of the wild. These beast masters are drawn to the perilous primal world, invigorated by its dangerous and untamed nature. Primitive landscape becomes home. Ferocious predator becomes kin. Whether in the thrill of the hunt or the heat of battle, beast masters call forth a litany of vicious animals to overwhelm prey and gnaw at their enemies’ will. <br />
<br />
&quot;Beast masters are drawn to the perilous primal world, invigorated by its dangerous and untamed nature&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
Beast Masters were already in a good place overall, but we’ve refined existing abilities and talents to better differentiate them from other Hunters. Previously, Cobra Shot filled all of your free moments in combat, leaving no time for managing your pet, which should be a defining characteristic of Beast Masters. To this end, and to aid in Focus accumulation, Dire Beast is now core to Beast Mastery, allowing you to repeatedly summon wild beasts that generate additional Focus for you through their every attack.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of the Beast Master Hunter in action, here’s a basic look at their core combat abilities:<br />
<br />
Cobra Shot<br />
<br />
30 Focus, 40 yd range, Instant<br />
A quick shot that causes moderate Physical damage.<br />
<br />
Dire Beast<br />
<br />
40 yd range, Instant, 10 sec cooldown<br />
Summons a powerful wild beast to attack your target for 8 sec. Each time the beast deals damage, you will gain 4 Focus.<br />
Summoning a beast reduces the remaining cooldown of Bestial Wrath by 15 sec.<br />
<br />
Kill Command<br />
<br />
20 Focus, 25 yd range (from pet), Instant, 6 sec cooldown<br />
Give the command to kill, causing your pet to instantly inflict strong damage to its target.<br />
<br />
Wild Call<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your critical strikes have a 30% chance to reset the cooldown of Dire Beast.<br />
<br />
Mastery: Master of Beasts<br />
<br />
Increases the damage done by your pets by 45% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
Additionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here’s one example of a Beast Mastery–specific talent:<br />
<br />
Way of the Cobra<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
For every pet or guardian you have active, Cobra Shot deals an additional 5% damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Survival<br />
While all hunters feel a calling to the wild, some serve as a reflection of its brutality. To them, the hunt is defined by unrelenting ferocity, where survival means facing one’s enemy eye-to-eye... and is always accompanied by merciless bloodshed. Weapons of great range are abandoned for instruments of close-quarters combat. Survival hunters are instinctive and crafty on the prowl, employing loyal beasts and laying deceptive traps to see their enemies undone. For these hunters know that to truly understand what it means to survive, one must first become familiar with the cruel face of death. <br />
<br />
&quot;The hunt is defined by unrelenting ferocity, where survival means facing one’s enemy eye-to-eye&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
Not only do Survival Hunters use melee weapons instead of ranged weapons, they’re also now the only Hunters that make use of traps—other specs will receive forms of crowd control and AoE damage suited to their distinct characteristics. Survival Hunters will snare and bleed their enemies, fighting them in close quarters with their trustworthy companion to maximize the brutality of the hunt. They have no direct control over Focus regeneration, but instead pool it up during successive Mongoose Bites to further amplify the damage they inflict.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Survival Hunters:<br />
<br />
Harpoon<br />
<br />
5-40 yd range, Instant, 15 sec cooldown<br />
Hurl a harpoon at your target and pull yourself toward them, rooting them in place for 3 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raptor Strike<br />
<br />
20 Focus, Melee Range, Instant.<br />
A vicious slash, dealing moderate Physical damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Laceration<br />
<br />
35 Focus, Melee Range, Instant, 10 sec cooldown<br />
Tear a wound in the target, dealing heavy damage over 12 sec.<br />
Developer Comment: We promise it will do good damage!<br />
<br />
<br />
Mongoose Bite<br />
<br />
Melee Range, Instant, 10 sec recharge, 3 charges<br />
A brutal attack, attempting to sever the enemy's limbs, dealing strong Physical damage.<br />
Each consecutive Mongoose Bite dealt within 3.5 sec of the last will deal 50% increased damage, stacking up to 6 times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Flanking Strike<br />
<br />
20 Focus, 25 yd range (from pet), Instant, 6 sec cooldown<br />
Give the command to kill, causing your pet to instantly inflict strong damage to its target.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wing Clip<br />
<br />
30 Focus, Instant<br />
Maims the target, reducing their movement speed by 50% for 15 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Hunting Companion<br />
<br />
Your pet’s attacks have a 20% (with Mastery from typical gear) chance to grant you an additional charge of Mongoose Bite.<br />
<br />
Additionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Survival-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Snake Hunter<br />
<br />
Instant, 1 min cooldown<br />
Instantly grants you 3 charges of Mongoose Bite.<br />
<br />
<br />
Marksmanship<br />
Marksmen, too, shroud themselves in the perils of the untamed wilds, perfecting the use of weapons that are deadliest from great range. They’ve maintained little interest, however, in gaining the loyalty of the many beasts inhabiting these crude landscapes. Instead, the marksman blends into the surrounding environment, surveying behavior of all manner of predator and gleaning deadly methods for stalking their own prey. A sniper in hiding, the marksman unleashes arrows and bullets with deadly precision, exposing the weakness in whoever—or whatever—passes through their crosshairs. <br />
<br />
&quot;A sniper in hiding, the marksman unleashes arrows and bullets with deadly precision&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
The Lone Wolf gameplay introduced in Warlords of Draenor proved extremely popular with Hunters, and that play style fit perfectly with our vision of Marksmanship Hunters as master archers and snipers, relying on their skill and precision with weapons rather than animal companions. All Marksmanship Hunters now gain Lone Wolf by default, ranging through the wilds without a pet beside them. On the resource front, the Marksman now gains Focus from the use of Arcane Shot. And, as a note for those who enjoyed the previous version of Survival gameplay, we have moved certain abilities, such as Black Arrow and Lock and Load, to Marksmanship-specific talents.<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Marksmanship:<br />
<br />
<br />
Arcane Shot<br />
<br />
40 yd range, Instant<br />
A quick shot that causes moderate Arcane damage, and generates 5 Focus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seek Vulnerabilities<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Targets hit by your Arcane Shot and Multi-Shot have a chance to be marked with Hunter's Mark for 6 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Marked Shot<br />
<br />
30 Focus, 40 yd range, Channeled<br />
Rapidly fires a shot at up to 3 targets affected by Hunter's Mark, dealing strong Physical damage. Usable while moving.<br />
Also exposes vulnerability in the target, snaring them by 15%, and increasing Aimed Shot damage done to the target by 25%. Lasts 10 sec, and stacks up to 3 times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aimed Shot<br />
<br />
50 Focus, 40 yd range, 1.5 sec cast<br />
A powerful aimed shot that deals strong Physical damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Sniper Training<br />
<br />
Critical strike damage and range of all shots is increased by 12.5% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Marksmanship-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Lock and Load<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Attach an explosive charge to Aimed Shot, dealing strong additional Fire damage to the target and all enemies within 4 yds.<br />
Your ranged auto attacks have a 5% chance to trigger Lock and Load, causing your next 2 Aimed Shots to cost no Focus and be instant.<br />
<br />
<br />
We hope you’ve enjoyed this early preview of the Hunter class in World of Warcraft: Legion. This first look should give you a good sense of what you can expect from this series, though not every class is undergoing this level of change; some are receiving updates that will be more subtle—a sharpening of rough edges—rather than the broad reimagining of the fantasy as we’ve demonstrated with Hunters.<br />
Tomorrow, the series continues with previews of Priests, Mages, and Paladins. Stay tuned!<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion Class Preview Series – Overview<br />
Welcome to the first of several blogs focused on classes in the upcoming Legion expansion!<br />
<br />
Our first big step when we begin working on classes for any new expansion is to decide on our high-level goals. New expansions, which send players to whole new lands and often transform entire game systems, give us a chance to explore extensive changes that we think will have a significant positive, lasting impact on the game.<br />
<br />
In Mists of Pandaria, for example, our primary aim was to revamp the talent system to give players more meaningful choices. For Warlords of Draenor, we turned our attention to the 100 levels worth of accumulated spells and abilities, full of redundancies and crowding out players’ action bars, and focused our efforts on pruning and consolidating abilities to make each class’s kit leaner and meaner—while still leaving room for future additions.<br />
<br />
Going into Legion, our guiding purpose is to strengthen the distinctive identity of each of our 12 classes and their specializations. The scope of these efforts includes making cosmetic improvements, enhancing existing abilities, adding new abilities, replacing too-generic abilities with more iconic ones, adjusting rotations to better reflect spec identity, and even completely redesigning some specs to carve out a strong identity where previously there was none.<br />
<br />
In the coming days, we’ll be sharing more details about the direction of each class in Legion, discussing their updated designs and sharing a look at their core combat abilities. It’s important to note that the base spells of a specialization represent a foundation upon which talents and Artifact traits will be built. Talents in particular will add a tremendous amount of depth—in Legion we’re quadrupling the number of spec-specific talents, which reinforce the distinction between specializations giving players interesting ways to customize their characters to suit their play styles.<br />
<br />
We’re looking forward to hearing your feedback and discussing these changes with everyone in the weeks ahead, and we’re excited to get this information out before our broader beta phase to make sure we have as much time as possible to iterate and carry on the conversation.<br />
<br />

guess it depends on your mastery/haste if you spam it when its ready, have to time it or stack up charges and blow them out when capped, we will see.</div></div><hr />

I have been playing hunter wrong this expansion. I know it. It's an alt. <br />
First impression:<br />
Sadly, I like my hunter, but the spec I liked(MM) is being further destroyed. The only way to actually play hunter is to play the worst spec (BM- Ranged+pet=hunter for me.). Mine will likely retire. Not a huge thing though. Might be interesting to see what people do with the non-hunter hunters.</div></div><hr />

Marksmen with a pet never made much sense in hindsight, regardless of people enjoying the playstyle or the feel of it, it just wasn't warcraft. Riflemen for the Humans and Archers for the Night Elves never came with a pet either, the whole point of being a marksman is to possibly conceal yourself (you are a scout, ranger, sniper) and not give away one's position. Having a pet follow you around during infiltration or exfiltration is obviously counter productive.<br />
<br />
Since it's all about Class fantasy and Warcraft (3) lore, it is a spot-on assessment of how the 3 distinct specs should be.</div></div><hr />

Rexxar is a melee hunter with a pet, so I'd say Survival =&gt; Rexxar &amp; Misha.</div></div><hr />

Interesting reaction. What is the difference in your mind if you or your pet (that you control and gets buffed by your gear and talents) generates the white and yellow numbers? If you don't press buttons nothing would happen with your pet so it's not like someone else is playing the game. Your hunter is standing there at range either way.</div></div><hr />

That could be alright, thought it at all possible it’d be nice if my pet kept taunt. Even if that’s not possible, a companion doing white and yellow damage would be better than my poor hunter wandering the world all alone.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Rereading your post I think I misunderstood it the first time around.<br />
<br />
The problem with the pet doing most of the damage on its own is that it’s like the computer is playing for me. If I’m manually pushing buttons to control my pet, the problem is that I’m then playing my pet instead of my character. My preferred style is to have a pet as a companion that adds a little extra damage/utility, but with most of the damage and gameplay happening with my marksman’s shots.</div></div><hr />

Um, wasn't that just because it was the best talent for its tier? I don't think Blizzard has given a whole lot of thought on this as they believe...<br />

<br />
Not only do Survival Hunters use melee weapons instead of ranged weapons, they’re also now the only Hunters that make use of traps—other specs will receive forms of crowd control and AoE damage suited to their distinct characteristics.<br />
<br />
That does not make any sense whatsoever. And before someone gets cute by trying to explain the words, yes I know what they're saying. It's still a nonsensical change.</div></div><hr />

Interesting gameplay... huge rewards for perfect timing, big penalties for slipping up. Too early and you miss a 400% hit at the end of the chain; too late and the whole thing resets.<br />
<br />
Hard to tell the exact breakdown of stat priorities without seeing some sims with the abilities but it looks like mastery stacking will be the way to go for the new survival. Probably won't be as unforgiving as it looks once mastery gear is factored in, especially with that talent granting 3 charges on a 1 minute CD as well. Get unlucky with mastery procs? Just pop the CD and keep wrecking. It might be a little similar to how Breath of Sindragosa gets used currently with blood DKs. Basically, just stack the crap out of a specific stat and run your high damage ability with nearly 100% uptime. Might become really hard for Blizz to balance the dps towards the end tiers. <br />
<br />
Additionally, since it doesn't look like BM mastery is changing we might be able to change between BM and Survival with the same gear aside from changing out the Artifact. Could be really nice for switching between melee and ranged depending on boss mechanics. BM looks like it will be mastery/crit and survival will either be mastery/haste or mastery/crit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What they did was homogenize the classes so that certain classes wouldn't be absolutely prefable or required to raid or pvp. Before Shamans were absolutely necessary, otherwise we'd never get Heroism/Bloodlust. They gave that to multiple classes. <br />
Paladins could give a lot of passive raid healing from Judgement of Light, they removed that and gave every class a cooldown or limited heal.<br />
Multiple classes had a talent called Replenishment which was absolutely essential to the Healing and some DPS Classes, Hunters in particular needed Replenishment, Judgement of Wisdom and Blessing of Wisdom in order to avoid going into Aspect of the Viper.<br />
<br />
The intent on making them more fantasy is the way they operate and their style and cosmetics.<br />
Beast Mastery utilizes Beasts a lot more. Marksman sacrifices the Pet component to go full on Ranged assault. Survival was the 'black sheep' and needed something different from Pet &amp; Ranged Damage or Pure Ranged Damage. So they reverted back to the earlier builds of Hunter and turned it back into a Melee spec.<br />
Combat Rogue is another example, it's pretty generic and was just simply a martial artist with weapons. Monks showed up and Combat rogue was not very distinguishable from Windwalker Monk. So they gave shelved the Combat spec for he Outlaw spec which can be identified as a Pirate or Thug. Instead of a twirly generic fighter.</div></div><hr />

The only 'bleh' thing here is you automatically assuming BM won't be viable. The expansion is almost a year away and you've already jumped to conclusions. I'm honestly surprised you're able to get up in the morning with that attitude.

<br />
Then play the two other specs? Survival looks awesome now. It's getting vanilla stuff back which makes me very excited. I loved hunter in vanilla so much. Using melee abilities when you had to and such. It was also very fun when I'd beat rogues in duels only meleeing. Ahhh man good times. But yeah I loved how Blizzard made a joke about Laceration doing good damage this time Hahahha. I remember I was survival in vanilla leveling up and was excited to get Laceration to try it out. Was the biggest let down ever. But yeah this is brilliant IMO. I despise letting my pet do all the work since that's just being lazy so now I have two specs to play that aren't focused on full pet stuff. Although it does sound cool to be in melee range beside your pet. As someone who quit due to boredom in WOD I'm really really pumped for this expac. I like that every class is getting changes to kill this stupid homogenization shit. I've been here since day one in 2004 and I can say I haven't been as excited for an expac since WotLK.</div></div><hr />

They're basically taking most of the stuff from both Survival and Marksmanship and concentrating them all into Marksmanship, and turning Survival into something new.<br />
<br />
So if you like the current Survival gameplay, you'll just want to switch over to Marksmanship and choose the appropriate talents to make it feel like current Survival. That includes Black Arrow, Lock and Load, etc.<br />
<br />
The only thing you'll be losing are traps, which are going to be used exclusively by Survival. Marksman and Beast Mastery will be getting new ranged CC spells to replace them; I imagine that you'll go back to using things like Freezing Arrow, which predate Trap Launcher.</div></div><hr />

Actually attached to Aimed Shot now... <br />
<br />
Lock and Load<br />
Passive<br />
Attach an explosive charge to Aimed Shot, dealing strong additional Fire damage to the target and all enemies within 4 yds.<br />
Your ranged auto attacks have a 5% chance to trigger Lock and Load, causing your next 2 Aimed Shots to cost no Focus and be instant.<br />

The Lone Wolf gameplay introduced in Warlords of Draenor proved extremely popular with Hunters.&quot;<br />
<br />
I actually like most of these changes, and that comes from a hunter through soon-to-be 11 years, and one that generally is not that keen on massive changes.<br />
However, when I read that &quot;statement&quot; I basically get the feeling that they did not really actually listen, or ask, their players.<br />
<br />
They looked at statistics, and simply decided that the talent most picked must be = the most popular. However, that does not make it popular, that makes the alternatives a poor choice.<br />
<br />
I've yet to speak to a single hunter (that I know) that actually likes Lone Wolf. But, as MM (as most hunters are these days) then you only really have that one choice if you want to do optimal DPS - and that's LW.<br />
<br />
That is not popularity, rather - I get the feeling that it is extremely unpopular. But, you are kind of &quot;forced&quot; to take it, as the alternatives are not as great.</div></div><hr />

I agree that they're going hard and heavy on the idea of a class/spec &quot;fantasy&quot; and they're doing more to tell us what that fantasy should be, rather than let us develop it ourselves.<br />
<br />
Personally my hunter is Beast Mastery, but she is not BM because she or I love a ton of beasts. Nor does she &quot;feel at home in the wilds&quot; and such. RP Alert: her backstory puts her more as Marksman but for a time when she learned the finer art of hunter-ing from the tauren, and bonded with a black lion. As a player, I like some of the beast-themed attacks (current and in the past) so Beast Mastery worked, but I focused heavily on that one pet. I've never been about amassing a vast stable of pets with various appearances... though for those who enjoy this aspect of Beast Mastery, I get it.<br />
<br />
However I think the game will be better with more spec diversification across specs and flavor, and that means lines are going to be drawn. They are making improvements here and that's good. One, I never liked how traps worked once we got past Classic WoW, and Trap Launcher always felt like a huge band-aid to the problem. Also, I have always felt that it would be fun to keep up the &quot;melee hunter&quot; idea of old, and they brought that back bigtime in Legion. Good on them.</div></div><hr />

I have been playing hunter wrong this expansion. I know it. It's an alt. <br />
First impression:<br />
Sadly, I like my hunter, but the spec I liked(MM) is being further destroyed. The only way to actually play hunter is to play the worst spec (BM- Ranged+pet=hunter for me.). Mine will likely retire. Not a huge thing though. Might be interesting to see what people do with the non-hunter hunters.<br />
<br />
How can you know that radical changes are afoot, not know how BM will really feel in its final Legion form, and yet somehow assume it will be the worst spec... based on what exactly?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, do not get me wrong. I love that we are getting specialisations that are actually varied now - different.<br />
<br />
Through Cata &amp; Pandaria BM, MM, and Survival has pretty much just been the same things with different names - In WoD we have MM standing out with the whole having to stand still for optimal damage thing. For Raiding/PvE then we have Survival not being optimal, BM can still keep up in some fights, but MM being the overall best spec currently.<br />
<br />
I've still got my very first, and second, pet. A Nightsaber from Teldrassil, and a pink raptor from Wetlands - Dino. I've used Dino for the majority of my hunter years, although these days I am using a spirit pet, and I do have pets that I need for bringing buffs for raids (happens ever so rarely). I do have some 30-ish pets, ranging from rares to pretty looking.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, going back to my first thing - I do like MM being &quot;something else&quot;, but saying that LW was &quot;Extremely popular&quot; is not the feeling I've got from talking with other hunters - And I have tried being MM.. But.. It's just not me. I do not like the standing still playstyle, never had. And I do not really massively like the idea of not having a pet - So I find that part a bit sad, even if it does make the spec different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) you just introduced a melee class in the Demon hunter. The game is already pretty damn melee heavy to begin with. . <br />
<br />
2) I honestly don't see too many people playing it with the exception of min/max pvp. Just the way it reads.. Of course ill try it out myself. Having played hunter for over 11 years. But I just dont see the point in taking a RANGED class.. and giving it a Melee spec... hopefully it works out. but im sure most raiding Hunters will choose MM</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you never played a hunter in vanilla. Traps were always in melee range back then. It felt great and took skill to drop them in the right spots. And almost every skill they gave for survival hunters was there in vanilla tbc etc. You can call Wing Clip &quot;hunter hamstring&quot; but it was there from the same moment hamstring was. And Laceration wasn't &quot;hunter rend&quot; it was a garbage talent that did horrible damage which is why they promise to make it do good damage this time. I'm pumped as hell personally. Hunter was my favorite class in vanilla so seeing these iconic abilities come back has me stoked. I also loved survival after the hunter revamp in patch 1.7. Some of that improved wing clip and counter attack action. Taking rogues down in melee range with my Zin'Rokh. Good times</div></div><hr />

Still have my first(actually second) pet I do have since 1.2 or so I guess - ghost saber cat from Darkshore.<br />

The first thing I noticed was using arcane shot to get focus. Then I noticed how much the other shots cost, so are we supposed to spam arcane shots (6-10 of them) in between other shots? I liked the steady, aimed rotation this expansion which made it less spammy than the other specs. I would also like to know what is being done with chimera shot (the iconic MM ability). The other specs have theirs - BW and whichever of the SV melee abilities (raptor strike prob), so where is ours?<br />
<br />
Also they need to explain what &quot;lone wolf is baseline&quot; means. Does it mean that you don't have a pet and can't summon one, or does it mean what it does when you pick the talent - you can choose more personal damage or to pull out a pet? I would like to still be able to solo as MM since I don't really want to play melee or BM.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping one wolf is like it is now and talents will be available to choose whether to play a classic style MM or a Surv/MM hybrid.</div></div><hr />

I think you misread the description: &quot;Each consecutive Mongoose Bite dealt within 3.5 sec of the last will deal 50% increased damage, stacking up to 6 times.&quot;<br />
<br />
Each consecutive Mongoose Bite will deal 50% increased damage, not your damage will be increased by 50% for 3.5 seconds after using Mongoose Bite. There is no reason to not use all charges as quickly as possible here.</div></div><hr />

What I was asking is to add a fourth specialization to all classes and tri-spec.<br />
DK: Flesh allows the DK to summon a multitude of different Ghouls and Skeletons doing a multitude of things.<br />
Druid: Lifewarden using the power of Freya spawning plants to effect the battlefield.<br />
Hunter: Track specialization uses scents to enrage and become intimidating to the beast pet causing it to be able to withstand and ignore damage.<br />
Mage: Heat gives the Mage a healing path allowing actions by the Mage to increase healing done to all or for a larger amount towards a single target.<br />
Monk: Chambers refers to the saved abilities that this Monk can expend while casting spells at range.<br />
Paladin: The all knowing Exorcism spec allowing Paladins to be a caster.<br />
Priest: Darkness is the 'fallen angel' to the Priest giving them more access and at a higher quantity to the fiend pet but at a stationary cost.<br />
Rogue: Thrower is simple: throw your weapon. Combat is changed to a tanking build similar to Brewmaster.<br />
Shaman: Earthen beings back the vanilla Shaman tank.<br />
Warlock: Possession is fit to this demonology class allowing them to sacrifice a minion to become a tank changing all casting spells to special melee strikes.<br />
Warrior: Mercenary gives the Warrior a way to attack at range using a chain on their weapon.</div></div><hr />

I can only speak for myself, but I love this. I've always imagined my MM hunter as a lone sniper and thought the pet was a cumbersome addition. When Lone Wolf was announced, I rejoiced. It's one step closer to my dream of a ranged physical stealth class, with glyph of Camo.<br />

Well, either you just picked up this game or have never played a hunter prior to cata. Wing Clip, Raptor Strike were there from the beginning and pruned at Cata. Kill Command, ehmm, or Mortal Strike: Hunter Edition is a staple of BM and if Surv is using it's pet in much the same way, having it makes perfect sense. A bleed was in the game for hunters too. <br />
<br />

<br />
Let's make no mistake, different classes with the same role is just flavour. Frost DKs and dps warriors are the same thing. Just different flavours. Elemental shamans and mages are the same thing, just different flavours. The mechanics they use to represent those flavours, enhanced by class fantasy as they've taken to calling it, are what make those classes interesting. It's very painstaking, and nigh impossible to balance so many classes and specs, but they do it because the game would be much less fun if all melee dps looked and played exactly the same.<br />
Most people think of a role they want and then choose the best class from their options. I find that what ends up happening is they'll usually end up playing a class they discover that they just like, even if it's a different role. Of course balance has something to do with this, but there's really something to be said about ignoring role completely, and playing a CLASS that interests someone, regardless of mechanics.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keyimin</div><div class="date">2015-11-10, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">... but im sure most raiding Hunters will choose MM<br />
<br />
How can you possibly be &quot;sure&quot; of that at this stage? Because MM is the go-to spec in HFC? Stark contrast from BRF, just one tier prior, let alone past expansions. Most raiding hunters will choose whichever spec clearly has a DPS advantage or the spec that offers the most utility for a particular tier or boss fight. We currently know the square root of fuck all about how that will ultimately play out in Legion. All we've seen are the super core, most basic abilities, with ONE talent example.<br />
<br />
Considering we can now multi-spec in Legion, switching specs on the fly becomes a bit more feasible as well (how feasible will depend on how good the catchup mechanics are for artifacts).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've been reading these forums for quite a while (overall one of the best sources for class/spec info!), and it just never ceases to amaze me how often people dive in with massive assumptions.<br />

Anyhoo, my bigger questions for BM haven't been answered by devs yet (at least i haven't seen it). Does anyone know:<br />
<br />
1. Do they plan on keeping BW as is?<br />
2. If so, does the 15s reduction of BW CD by Dire Beast stack with each successive Dire Beast (i.e., every dire beast further reduces the 60s CD of BW by another 15s?)<br />
<br />
If so, by my rudimentary math, even without Dire Beast CD resets, you'd be able to reduce the CD of BW to 20s. If you got ONE reset on Dire Beast during that time, then you could reduce the CD of BW to 5s. Is that right? I'm special when it comes to the numbers of this shit (I rely on those much smarter than me for such things), so please do jump in and demonstrate my basic math idiocy if I'm wrong here. Because if I'm right, then BW would still have 5s left on its uptime when it came off CD. And THAT would lead me to a third question:<br />
<br />
3. Is BW going to be capable of refreshing/stacking?<br />
<br />
Then again, all of this will be remarkably irrelevant if the answer to my first question is &quot;No.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I know everything is going to be different. The only way to actually play hunter is to play the worst spec.<br />
I see how that is confusing. I only mean that, for me, right now, it's my opinion that BM is the worst. I put italics to denote that. It might be different in Legion but since I can't know how it will feel then, I am going based on how it feels now. <br />
Hunter at ranged, pet taunting and engaging the enemy directly is how I imagine hunter. Not meleeing next to my pet or going without one. So if BM is the only hunter spec that plays that way but still feels like it does now.... then I will probably retire my hunter. <br />
<br />
Sorry for not being more clear.</div></div><hr />

Genuine question out of curiosity mostly: What is it about the current BM style of play that you dislike so much?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaebryel Quintyne</div><div class="date">2015-11-10, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, either you just picked up this game or have never played a hunter prior to cata. Wing Clip, Raptor Strike were there from the beginning and pruned at Cata. Kill Command, ehmm, or Mortal Strike: Hunter Edition is a staple of BM and if Surv is using it's pet in much the same way, having it makes perfect sense. A bleed was in the game for hunters too. <br />
<br />
Too many people on here QQ'n about what they aren't getting, when they don't know what they're getting yet. <br />
Too many people on here should be working for Blizz &quot;At least make it good&quot;..<br />
<br />
Be mindful though that they cleared up Flanking strike, which the OP mentioned as Mortal Strike: Hunter edition... They said it will make BOTH you and the pet go behind the target and attack it. So it is like blink strike in DOTA from Mortred (Phantom Assasin) and Rikimaru (stealth assasin) if anyone knows about DOTA that much except with a pet of course in case of SV hunters in WoW.</div></div><hr />

Bestial Wrath is largely unchanged. Each time you use Dire Beast, the remaining cooldown on BW is reduced.</div></div><hr />

Traps were always in melee range back then. It felt great and took skill to drop them in the right spots. And almost every skill they gave for survival hunters was there in vanilla tbc etc. You can call Wing Clip &quot;hunter hamstring&quot; but it was there from the same moment hamstring was. And Laceration wasn't &quot;hunter rend&quot; it was a garbage talent that did horrible damage which is why they promise to make it do good damage this time. I'm pumped as hell personally. Hunter was my favorite class in vanilla so seeing these iconic abilities come back has me stoked. I also loved survival after the hunter revamp in patch 1.7. Some of that improved wing clip and counter attack action. Taking rogues down in melee range with my Zin'Rokh. Good times<br />
<br />
You had scatter shot back then which made it easier to close in on enemies and freezing trap them. Additionally, you could essentially kite enemies into ice trap and then run out to avoid getting hit by them. Nowadays, dropping a glyphed explosive trap on yourself manually can be great in arenas.<br />
<br />
However, I have no idea why any of that would work well for a melee character. You *don't* want to be away from your target, so stuff like ice trap or any replacement knockback trap would be pretty bad. Point blank freezing trap will be clumsy as hell in arenas because if you want to CC a healer, you would need to stop attacking your target, run all the way over to them and then go back to your target. Not to mention they would probably just see you coming and kite your sorry ass.<br />
<br />
Sure, you get harpoon and I'm assuming you keep disengage, but having to burn your closers just getting CC on the table would make the spec utter garbage on that front.<br />
<br />
Most of these are old abilities, yes, abilities from a time when classes were homogeneous as hell and most abilities had little to no flavor. I have no idea why anyone would want to return to that, but suit yourselves. I'm sorry, but &quot;melee bonk&quot; and &quot;melee bleed&quot; don't get me pumped for an expansion in 2015. That's some 2004 shit.</div></div><hr />

My favorite way to play a hunter has always been marksman with my pet beside me. With Legion, the closest thing would be Beast Mastery, but that’s no good for me either because I don’t want my pet to be the one doing all the damage. Survival isn’t interesting to me at all because I’ve already got an army of dedicated melee characters.<br />
<br />
I guess I’ll be shelving my hunters for this xpac.<br />
<br />
BM wasn't complete Pet DPS, but it did do at least 40% of it.<br />
<br />
Plus, a lot of Marks hunters loved Lone Wolf because your pet is worthless as MM.</div></div><hr />

I've always imagined my MM hunter as a lone sniper and thought the pet was a cumbersome addition. When Lone Wolf was announced, I rejoiced. It's one step closer to my dream of a ranged physical stealth class, with glyph of Camo.<br />
<br />
Overall I'm really happy about this. Snipers ! Melee hunters ! BMs with beasts everywhere !<br />
I don't play my hunter very often, but I am very happy with the petless option, too.</div></div><hr />

Will Probably go for Survival and Beast Mastery. I think you could have all speccs now, not only dual right? But to keep building up 2 artifact weapons sounds like a lot of work, so 3 would be quite tiresome. Imagine Druids 4 speccs. ^^</div></div><hr />

logical, due to Survival hunter will not have ranged weapons anymore.<br />
