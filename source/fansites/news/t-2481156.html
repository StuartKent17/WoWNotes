It’s been a lot of fun over the last couple of months to dive into the development of WoW Classic with the team, while trying to answer some of the many questions that have been posed here and elsewhere. Looking at the plans for a phased content release, unlocking dungeons and raids, and unlocking other systems, it’s clear that the aim is to create a progression experience that resembles the original arc from when WoW first launched. In thinking about what belongs in each of those phases, the team’s focus has always been on rewards.<br />
<br />
Developers have scoured through vendor lists and treasure tables for items that were added in patches, and then attached them to the staged content unlock plan. This means that if a new item was originally added to a dungeon boss’s loot table with Ahn’Qiraj, you shouldn’t expect it to appear in WoW Classic until Phase 5, which is the phase that contains Ahn’Qiraj content.<br />
<br />
Along the way, we’ve seen many questions asking if we’re also retracing the steps of incremental changes to individual items and their stats that may have occurred throughout original WoW. Such a plan could be called “progressive itemization.”<br />
<br />
Here’s an example of progressive itemization. The Tier 2 warrior Helm of Wrath originally had Spirit and Agility on it, as well as critical strike chance. In Patch 1.5.0, the helm’s stat budget was changed to Stamina, Strength, and Defense, along with elemental resistances. Then in Patch 1.7.0, the amount of Defense on the helm was reduced. In Patch 1.8.0, the 5-piece set bonus that included the helm was fixed to work with Whirlwind, and in 1.9.0, it got a better look with an art update.<br />
<br />
WoW Classic will only include that last version of the item, as it existed in our reference version: 1.12.<br />
<br />
Of course, this raises the question “why?”. Why differentiate between adding new items along the way and making modifications to existing items?<br />
When new items are added to loot tables, you’re generally seeing a deliberate effort to provide catch-up gear and/or to provide new goals for players who had exhausted an existing reward structure. For example, in original WoW, items were added to give players a way to quickly prepare for Ahn’Qiraj without having to spend months in Molten Core and Blackwing Lair.<br />
<br />
The changing of existing items in patches often illustrated the original design team responding to how players played the game. Their primary goal at the time was to make rewards more relevant and exciting. Developers realizing that Spirit probably wasn’t an ideal stat for a warrior raid set helm* was an example of this sort of change.<br />
<br />
Many class abilities and talents evolved similarly. For example, going into Patch 1.8.0, the game designers determined that Moonkin Form would be a more compelling 31-point Balance druid talent than the original selection of Hurricane.<br />
<br />
It’s important to remember that there’s more to WoW Classic than a long series of changes. Even if each item change could be made, and even if every class change could be progressively recreated, that would still only constitute a piece of the overall landscape of original WoW. We remember how early raid progression was punctuated by unexpected roadblocks and workarounds:<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as we know, every one of the first Ragnaros kills was only possible due to a bug that made Lava Burst temporarily stop firing after a wipe.<br />
Chromaggus was practically unbeatable due to Ignite Flesh unavoidably and lethally stacking on tanks, until it was discovered that Flamegor’s ramp in the laboratory allowed the entire raid to damage Chromaggus without being exposed to his breath attacks.<br />
C’Thun was infamously seen as unkillable until a hotfix in April 2006 prevented additional tentacles from spawning while he was vulnerable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Recreating, and then re-fixing every major progression-affecting bug wouldn’t account for what we think matters much more: the people playing the game. There were many unknowns in original WoW. The first guilds to reach Nefarian spent their initial pulls testing different ideas they had and trying to figure out what condition would get them past the first part of the fight (defeating 40 drakonids). That experience can’t be recreated, because the knowledge can’t be unlearned. For a long time after Patch 1.4.0 came out, many players simply had no idea how good Obsidian Edged Blade or Aged Core Leather Gloves were. The power of weapon skill will be no surprise in WoW Classic.<br />
<br />
So rather than try to recreate a specific experience from 2005 that can never fully be recaptured, our aim has been to accurately and fully restore the original game’s mechanics and stats to their final and most polished state from before The Burning Crusade. That mission has been a pillar of WoW Classic’s design from its inception.<br />
<br />
This means that while content will be unlocked progressively to allow for each raid tier to shine, systems such as class design, battleground mechanics, and stats on existing items will all be set to their final 1.12 conditions. That should take the pressure off players to be constantly figuring out what we might do next to remain exactly in line with how the game once played out, and we can all focus a little more on community building and enjoying the experience together.</div></div><hr />

There is not &quot;progressive vs non progressive itemization server&quot;, all of it will be 1.12 itemization. Only place this leads into issues is 1.12 itemzation on pvp gear pre AQ.</div></div><hr />

Nothing has progressive itemization... They just explain what it could have been. Looks like reading is actually hard.</div></div><hr />

Yes MC was always going to be easy. Now it's going to be even easier. It's not just MC, this is going to be a problem almost until naxx. Almost as if players are always ahead 1 tier than they should be.<br />
<br />
When pre-raid bis gear is better than gear from MC on a non-progressive itemization server and gear from MC is better than gear from BWL on a non-progressive server, content will become trivial even faster than it already is.</div></div><hr />

And honestly.... blue dungeon gear was sometimes better then raid gear anyway...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, reading seems hard to you considering my point flew right past your head. Here, I'll make it real easy for you,<br />
<br />
Pre raid bis from Classic will be better than hypothetical Molten Core gear from a progressive itemization hypothetical server</div></div><hr />

It was allllll going to be super easy regardless, there's also the fact that it's on the new API, which means all the new addons like Weakauras and DBM far beyond what vanilla ever had in functionality will be available, THAT will make it even more trivial then gear.</div></div><hr />

I'm genuinely surprised too. The Classic team is a fraction of the current one and yet they are the only team within Blizzard these days showing any passion or enjoyment for what they are doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right when you say that which is the problem with changes. Changes justify other changes. The content being easy isn't an excuse to make it even easier.<br />
<br />
We're talking about gear that is 2x as effective with 1.12 stats. The weapon I linked earlier is but one example. 40 spellpower is better than 1% crit with 7stam and 5 int.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Non-progressive itemization is just lazy, a bunch of guys coding private servers as a hobby manage to do it almost flawlessly</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anything addons could do much more in vanilla then they can do now. Over the years the possibilities of addons were only reduced, not increased.<br />
<br />
The addon community just had to grow and come up with ideas, and have time to implement them. This was not vanilla limiting it artificially, just a factor of time. As such, the &quot;API&quot; has no impact on this - on the contrary even, by blocking addons like Decursive which were possible in Vanilla.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Decursive is brought up a lot, but in reality it isn't that much worse today then it was back in the day. The only one that truly got worse was Healbot auto picking ranks for you, but it can still SUGGEST ranks, so it's not even going to be that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
Proper threat meters? Weakauras? Much more in depth boss mods? all of that will make the game much easier then it was on top of the biggest nerf to vanilla in existence... Our combined knowledge. We already know everything about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Said it before, this is not going to be like Vanilla, they do not have everything they require, and neither they would ever tryhard to make it feel like Vanilla.<br />
<br />
Its literally a &quot;We are listening to the players, we arent EA!&quot; combined with &quot;We are gonna waste a couple of million dollars to make much more just from the marketing and &quot;good grades with players&quot; without even launching the game yet&quot;.<br />
<br />
Its gonna be just a server that wont go offline because a GM crushed his car and stole the money that was meant for server hosting, with a ton more bug fixing since its not basement developer but a proper small team in an actual company.<br />
<br />
So you will know your character will be there if you dont check the forums for a week if the private server is offline or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I chose the blade for one simple reason,<br />
<br />
The blade originally had something like 7stam, 5 int and 1% crit <br />
<br />
The pre raid bis weapon on the same patch had 1% crit<br />
<br />
I didn't say gear from mc is inferior to pre-raid bis gear, i meant that mc gear from a progressive itemization server is inferior to non-progressive pre-raid bis gear</div></div><hr />

I like this decision. Is stupid to introduce the old bad gear just to fool people that dosen't know about the changes. Only people that would get benefited from that would be those that do know of the changes, so they can probably get the items easily as people pass on gear that looks undesirable... then they'd save them in the bank till blizzard introduced the changes... Nothing but special snowflake greed and maliciousness. So with this decision, they ensure the game field will be fair and square!<br />

Sure it might. But all I'm saying is that these things were not impossible back then, just noone made them yet. Its really quite the same as &quot;knowledge&quot;, since a bossmod for example is just a repository of bossfight knowledge.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, everything's known and there's no sense of discovery. The people you meet will be there for different reasons. That's just a small percentage of why it won't be the same. I'm not complaining and what they're doing makes sense, but I'm going to be that guy- It's not going to be a Classic experience.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobertMugabe</div><div class="date">2019-04-26, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All of these item updates are so overhyped anyways. Almost all of the items that actually got &quot;noticeably&quot; buffed are top items that would've gotten updated in the earlier phases already (phase 2 and 3) and thus that's the type of thing that wouldn't affect almost anyone.<br />
<br />
Heck even Nostalrius only did that for &quot;marketing&quot; reasons aka it appeared that they were far more serious about a proper vanilla experience than the &quot;competition&quot; was.<br />
<br />
I am sure though that some &quot;top&quot; players and streamers will make a big deal about this and how this ruins everything, because classic should be all about that :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

But all I'm saying is that these things were not impossible back then, just noone made them yet. Its really quite the same as &quot;knowledge&quot;, since a bossmod for example is just a repository of bossfight knowledge.<br />
<br />
A lot of the top guilds had their own mods that weren't publicly released. There was much more of a &quot;don't tell&quot; vibe to raiding so guilds were actually able to do better by having better knowledge than their competitors. Knowledge of fights was its own skill and could be a huge advantage over other guilds.</div></div><hr />

It is common sense to me.<br />
Progression is nice and I was surprised when they committed to releasing in phases but in 1.5-2 years it won't matter anyway.<br />

<br />
That's a terrible suggestion and they absolutely shouldn't do that. Some private servers were doing this and really what they ended up with were just longer and more boring fights.<br />
<br />
All these itemization updates are so incredibly overhyped anyways. It's the type of stuff that will only affect MC and Ony progress guilds (since almost all of the items in question are endgame dungeon and MC/Ony items). And it's not going to completely trivialize any content (even if we're about to assume that classic will be as &quot;easy&quot; as it is on private servers)<br />
<br />
It won't affect PVP or any other 40-man raid and it especially won't affect all these people that won't be part of the top guilds, aka almost everyone (heck most players will never raid)</div></div><hr />

I don't think the people that are looking forward to Classic are truly expecting a recreation of their experience 15 years ago.<br />
<br />
With that said, as somebody who played extensively on Light's Hope from day one through to the end of Naxx, I'm looking forward to the community experience and feeling like I'm playing an actual MMORPG which simply isn't something available (nor has it been for a long time) with current WoW.<br />

Even on a private server, the experience was night and day.</div></div><hr />

I spent years arguing that it would happen someday and when they finally announced it I was stupidly excited for it. Now I don't even know if I'll try it. If it was JUST this I wouldn't have too much of an issue with it, but literally everything great about playing a warrior or rogue was patched out by 1.12. <br />
<br />
1.12 warrior PvP wasn't nearly as fun as warrior PvP prior to that, but it was worse for literally everyone fighting against the warrior. Incoming chain mace stuns. :) People who didn't play a warrior in vanilla will never know the joy of rage generation before Blizzard screwed with it. Rogues will never know the barman shanker grind and that satisfying feeling of one-shotting a cloth wearer after. The things that I actually enjoyed about Vanilla (Earlier unadulterated PvE/PvP and un-messed with classes) are gone forever.</div></div><hr />

I understand that you probably think that but you have to realize that people have played already on private servers and they still love it. <br />
<br />
I'm sure some people will fall into this category, but it's just a fact that the game remains fun even without the nostalgia and there will be people who prefer it over current WoW and there's nothing wrong with that. <br />

It's not like everyone will be running around in PVP gear though. Only people who play PVP like a full-time job for months will get the epic gear, and raiding wouldn't be their priority. I guess it would impact world first strats, but does anyone care about that in Classic?</div></div><hr />

The problem here is that people like you probably don't know what progressive itemization even is and definitely don't know the impact that 1.12 stats on all gear has on early raids.<br />

Mages for example will have 2x the amount of spellpower, a lot more spellhit, more HP and mana.<br />

It wont be &quot;real classic&quot; as we all got better pcs than we had 15 years ago (i hope) so not having 10-20fps during raids but 250fps will make raids go smoother, same with SSDs compared to old HDDs, and monitors.<br />

No? More like this helm is great and it’ll be better in the future. Plus I don’t expect they have to go use pre 1.5 gear. Just don’t use the patch that revamped the PVP gear. It’s ridiculous.

It would be absurd to make stats on gear suck and pretend that they and we haven't experienced and learned the things we have. It's true that people trying Classic for the first time won't have that same experience of going into a much more roughly put together game. Some might almost even say randomly put together in some spots. But frankly that's good. There's no reason to want new people to have to slog through the rough parts like a forced museum ride just so some of us older folk can go &quot;see there lil' Johnny? We used to have to beat things to death with nothing more than spirit and a club!&quot; It's more than enough to simply say, &quot;hey! None of your whinin'. This stuff used to actually have terrible stats. Now we're many times stronger.&quot; And if it's too easy for some, then they can relive the days of tanking bosses without pants so you can generate rage. Now THAT's a faithful recreation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh the raids are easy but not as easy as people think if judging pservers. Those were buggy and didn’t work right at all. I knew that though when I saw new guilds doing Vael in 1/4th the time geared guilds did and they did it without any FR on anyone at all. Sure enough it was due to many broken things like resists not working. Come live people will think they don’t need resist gear and they’ll think threat doesn’t matter then they’ll be in for a big surprise. Especially all those warriors and locks! <br />
<br />
I remember we had friggin broodlord lashlayer wipes over unlucky warlock crits. One shadowbolt crit, broodlord goes nuts and it’s all over. Alliance were lucky having salvation!</div></div><hr />

<br />
So to summarize, you need to work on your reading comprehension.<br />
<br />
&quot;So rather than try to recreate a specific experience from 2005 that can never fully be recaptured, our aim has been to accurately and fully restore the original game’s mechanics and stats to their final and most polished state from before The Burning Crusade. That mission has been a pillar of WoW Classic’s design from its inception.<br />
<br />
This means that while content will be unlocked progressively to allow for each raid tier to shine, systems such as class design, battleground mechanics, and stats on existing items will all be set to their final 1.12 conditions. That should take the pressure off players to be constantly figuring out what we might do next to remain exactly in line with how the game once played out, and we can all focus a little more on community building and enjoying the experience together.&quot;<br />
<br />
1.12 is pre-patch to 2.0 and when they made all the changes, hence why i said bc. This is why I never got my hopes or jump on the bandwagon for the whole classic thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's like saying &quot;7.3.5 is the prepatch to 8.0&quot;.<br />
<br />
1.12 didn't have a lot of sweeping base class changes (they changed a lot with rogues) but the tbc systems and the HUGE tbc class changes didn't start until 2.0.1 and weren't fully implemented until 2.0.3 so your statement makes ZERO sense. 1.12 was still VERY much Vanilla wow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is such a long winded cry fest for people wanting to make the early version of the game more 'authentic'. Sorry, but Molten Core and Blackwing Lair are going to get face fucked no matter what version or itemization they decide to run with. The example they gave about how people didn't know how good aged core gauntlets was back in 2005 is so painfully true, knowledge alone is what will make early parts of this game so fucking trivial. You know why Molten Core was hard for my guild over a dozen years ago? Because we had retarded people in our guild that thought the shitty tier sets in Molten Core were good, and they couldn't figure out why the one warlock/mage did way more damage than their respective counterparts (wearing +shadow damage greens).<br />
<br />
PvP gear being obtainable earlier really doesn't ruffle my feathers at all. If you want to lock yourself in your basement and do BGs/wPvP for 12 hours a day over a 3 month period to have a slight to moderate advantage in piss easy content, all the power to you. People are fucking acting like there will be swarms of people running around with R13/R14 gear. If any of you even bothered to play Vanilla when it was current, you would realize how far from the truth that was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pre raid bis from Classic will be better than hypothetical Molten Core gear from a progressive itemization hypothetical server<br />
<br />
There is no hypothetical. What you are talking about is nonsense. Sit back down.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterHamster</div><div class="date">2019-04-27, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know it's an unfair comparison, since the Live/BFA team is working forward while the Classic team is set out according to a pretty already-mapped-out plan, but it's such a gigantic difference in the level of passion that comes out of their communication. Live is run by suits, while Classic feels like it's run by gamers.<br />
<br />
That is of course an overexaggeration and a simplification, but comparing to the dev posts we get from BFA, one of the biggest differences is that BFA is trying to be a smörgåsbord for every. single. type. of. player in the universe. It feels like they are afraid of making a single piece of the community annoyed, and thus BFA is this grey goo no one really enjoys a lot. Meanwhile Classic devs/posts doesn't apologize for what it's trying to be. I miss WoW being developed by passionate gamers (go look at early BlizzCon WoW design videos if you need any proof), and not PR managers that plays Excel sheets, trying to artificially calculate &quot;fun&quot; more than the game itself.<br />
<br />
I would respect BFA more if Blizzard just flat out stated what they want modern WoW to be;<br />
&quot;Look, we want this Theme Park action RPG style of WoW, the times of having to play for weeks in order to get geared enough to merely get into a raid is never coming back. We want players to see all content quickly and if they want a challenge they can go into high m+ or heroic raids&quot;, because at least then they've made their design paradigm clear. Instead, as mentioned, it's as if they are afraid to upset anyone at all.<br />
<br />
This decision to not have items change between phases will upset some players, but they've made their points really, really clear why they choose to do this. And honestly I am not too convinced people would have much fun having items in their banks that are trash now due to early-classic itemization, but in an unknown amount of weeks or months will become BiS or a clear upgrade when the next phase rolls out.<br />
<br />
Their reasonable goals are clear and they are working towards that goal. BFA is more like an amorphous goo that is being pulled in all directions at once.<br />
I suppose I can hope for Classic to be popular enough that Blizzard takes a step back and looks at why players in Classic are so much more willing to do very repetitive tasks for minor upgrades (hint: it's because they needed those upgrades in order to progress, it wasn't just a +2% overall dps in already cleared content, but maybe the difference of seeing the first boss of that content at all).</div></div><hr />

NO. I'm pretty sure this is about that &quot;alt&quot; feeling when you know everything about the raiding content and just creat another toon/alt to have fun with.<br />
At least this is what I'm planning to do, change the factions, start with another main. If you try to recreate the same feeling you had in 2004-2006 by playing the exact faction and exact class, you will find yourself in disappointment isle.<br />
In fact, that is why we all played vanilla pservers anyway, just to &quot;level an alt&quot;.<br />

<br />
Threat Meters indeed were quite different then, but they existed eventually - especially towards the end of Vanilla. It was a lot more work manually tracking threat, but it did work, and there were at least two addons doing the work - KTM (KLHThreatMeter) and the original Omen.</div></div><hr />

People will clear MC (except Rag) on the day they hit 60. Nef will fall the day BWL will open.<br />
<br />
People will know how to perfectly play their characters, how to itemize them, and every single quirk and secret about the boss mechanics. Also you have to keep in mind that &quot;Look yo, that boss makes fire on the floor, and you must walk out of that.&quot; was like the craziest mechanic for raiders in those days (and sometimes the only mechanic the boss had), while today this is just one minor mechanic of basically every boss that usually isn't even mentioned when discussing tactics because just everyone knows what to do.<br />
<br />
Considering that you have to understand that gear that time was made for people who know nothing, can't play their char, have no plan and can't avoid shit. So the stuff you loot from 60's dungeons will make MC a cake-walk, Dire Maul gear will make BWL easy, and so on, simply because even the worst LFR raider today will still play better than the the average raider in classic.</div></div><hr />

I get that not following the original patch design for items will definitely throw a curve into how the fights were originally designed (warlocks gonna be scary), but theres no need to name call and insult.<br />

I, like others, mostly worry about what PvP items will do. Those wanting to do the top tier raid on a top tier schedule will for sure have a PvP focus for the &quot;BiS&quot; gear.</div></div><hr />

Can anybody enlighten me, why developers back then thought warrior setpieces could use spirit or rogues need intellect?<br />
Was this just a bug, a mistake in stat allocation or was there some intend behind that decision?<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly every stat did something for everybody or not?<br />
Intellect gave spellpower and spellcrit right? So, did a rogues' poison benefit from int for example? I played one in vanilla but I don't remember. :D</div></div><hr />

I've already explained this countless times, the problem is that people don't know what progressive itemization is and for some reason correlating progressive itemization with non-progressive itemization seems like a hard concept to grasp. Others just have no idea exactly how better some gear becomes. We're talking about gear that is sometimes 2x, 3x better than it should be at the start of the game.<br />
<br />
The blue pvp sets are a good example to exemplify this, the non-upgraded pvp blue set for mages has like 60 spellpower, most pieces don't have it.<br />
<br />
The upgraded blue pvp set has got substantially better raw stats, more crit, some hit and around double the amount of spellpower. The upgraded blue pvp set is better than bloody non-upgraded full t2<br />
<br />
A mage with pre-raid bis on a non-progressive server has got better gear than a fully mc geared mage on a progressive itemization server. This makes raids which are already easy, too easy.<br />
<br />
<br />

Progressive itemization is a very slippery slope, where does it end? Progressive skill trees, progressive zones, progressive mobs?

As far as I see it, let people suffer. When they realize that guilds will force them to PvP and when they get stomped by people in PvP gear on meters/PvP they'll come complaining en masse.<br />

Yes, there will probably be such guilds. Guilds full of try-hards hardcore wannabes who are stuck in BfA mentality. If guild forces players to PvP, that guild won't survive long because leaders and members clearly have different goals. I wouldn't want to be in such guild.<br />

You are wrong. &quot;Not knowing&quot; and disagreeing with you are two different things.<br />
<br />
If you aren't aware, majority of players didn't start at very beginning of vanilla. Most started later at some point during vanilla. Even then only tiny minority got to raiding before final (or close to final) itemisation became available. Having latest patch item stats is much closer to vanilla experience than you think.<br />
<br />
Progressive itemisation is clusterfuck waiting to happen. Knowing that item that sucks will not suck few months later makes massive difference. That alone guarantees that classic will be nothing like vanilla. People will have to look up every looted item to check what stats item will have in next patch. Its terrible idea all around.</div></div><hr />

You seem to disagree with me, those guys up there didn't disagree with me, they were talking about something they didn't understand. All your points are valid points, I just think you're underestimating the impact 1.12 itemization will have on early raids at least up until AQ</div></div><hr />

I don't even really disagree with this approach but with every single update they give us I get less excited about Classic. I spent years arguing that it would happen someday and when they finally announced it I was stupidly excited for it. Now I don't even know if I'll try it. If it was JUST this I wouldn't have too much of an issue with it, but literally everything great about playing a warrior or rogue was patched out by 1.12. <br />
<br />
1.12 warrior PvP wasn't nearly as fun as warrior PvP prior to that, but it was worse for literally everyone fighting against the warrior. Incoming chain mace stuns. :) People who didn't play a warrior in vanilla will never know the joy of rage generation before Blizzard screwed with it. Rogues will never know the barman shanker grind and that satisfying feeling of one-shotting a cloth wearer after. The things that I actually enjoyed about Vanilla (Earlier unadulterated PvE/PvP and un-messed with classes) are gone forever.<br />

Save yourself and mine the trouble and don't play at all. Indifferent tourists are a waste of time.</div></div><hr />

That you will be a waste of digital space if you roll on Classic servers that is the detriment to those who are at least somewhat interested to play.</div></div><hr />

The Classic team is a fraction of the current one and yet they are the only team within Blizzard these days showing any passion or enjoyment for what they are doing.<br />
<br />
Whilst it is nice to see hey are communicating a lot, remember, this is the most we have had from them since th announced last year so :D<br />
<br />
But I genuinely think the disparagy between the two, isn't down to passion, but more down to the product itself. With Classic, we know what we are getting. There aren't any real surprises in terms of content and what that content will be like. SO they can be a bit more in-depth with their discussion.<br />
<br />
With live, they have to be a lot more controlled, as there are still races, e-sports (lol), and a very VERY vocal fanbase that will whine about literally everything and anything at times, so they have to be a lot more cared in what they do/don' communicate. Heck, one misplaced word can have people screeching at high volume like insane howler monkey's.<br />
<br />
All that aside though, Classic is a last gasp for me, if it isn't as fun as I want it to be, I think I am a full-time FF14 monkey then. My hopes aren't even that high, after Rift Prime and Lotro Legendary server (and its wonderful super shit Update bug that has made it impossible for me to play, even though I want to give them money, I just cannot...)<br />

MC was ever more than a farm/introduction raid by the time BWL/Onyxia released anyways.<br />
It was only something special if you were in a shit-heap feeder guild tbh.

Heh. I'm an &quot;FF14 monkey&quot; as you put it all the time mate. :)<br />
<br />
But yeah Classic is WoWs last chance to reel me in. If that fails then it'll just be FF14 and ESO for me until Blizzard get their act together which is unlikely.<br />
<br />
And god don't remind me about Rift Prime. The one time I gave Trion a small benefit of the doubt and they threw it back in peoples faces. I mean it's shut down now because the playerbase was that pitifully low but I remember launch. Content not working, ability lag for a month, specs like Saboteur completely broken and so on.<br />
<br />
Prime was an abomination progression server which was trying to be both classic and progression but failing at it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wife is also, and the more I watch them and their plan, the more I realise they have shit together it is unreal. Like, people have been whining about the 4 seater mount, and you have to remind them that in perspective, in WoW? That would definitely be a purchase only one, or require such a ridiculous gold-sink as to be unobtainable for the majority. FF14 just gives you it basically for free (well, minimum effort free such as 200MGP which still takes time), so you can play with friends and such together.<br />
As it is easy to get, everyone can have one, thus opening the door for a more cosmetic version should they wish to introduce it (4 seater elephant or something), whereras in WoW, some of the more functional mounts are locked or require too much money for the majority, This isn't an entitlement whine, but more a &quot;function things should be available, pretty cosmetic things should be earned/paid for). Point is, the FF14 team seems to really know their shit, adds a lot of stuff each and every patch (dungeons AND raids), and communicates their intention quite well. Making changes without altering the actual game itself too much. Something WoW simply doesn't do imo.<br />
<br />
And yes, Prime was a transgression against God and a proverbial hate crime against all humanity. Thank fuck it is closing.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you should be the one to leave if you can't handle discussion. :) Sometimes in life people are going to criticize things that you like, sport. That doesn't mean they don't like those things, sometimes the harshest critics of something will be people who DO like it but want to make it better. You can't make the things you like better if you're afraid to criticize them.</div></div><hr />

I don't get why people seem to have this hatred for Classic personally.<br />
<br />
So bloody what if it ends up doing better or worse than Retail? Either way it's a nice thing to offer for players that want that different experience and that's fine.<br />
<br />
I will be trying it personally as I'm sick of the current game but I'm not going to give people hassle because they enjoy the current game. Everyone can enjoy different things.</div></div><hr />

What's really ironic is that MMO-Champion historically has been the hub for &quot;Modern WoW SUCKS! Vanilla was better!&quot; conversations for the past how many years. Now that Classic is coming out, that dynamic seems to have been reversed.</div></div><hr />

Nah, right now its Retail sucks! but classic isn't much better!....<br />

Not really. Its just much easier to notice negativity, so even if amount of negative players is small they are much easier to notice. If you look at overall posts, there is very little negativity in classic forums.</div></div><hr />

No, thanks. Blizzard in this instance is the one trying to &quot;improve&quot; classic by starting us out with 1.12 loot. I feel the original way was better. I'd like classic to be as authentic as possible tbh. I guarantee you one of the largest complaints when it releases is that it's not authentic enough. :)</div></div><hr />

Truly wouldn't be surprised if classic surpasses retail numbers. The mmo community is starving for a good game again and classic brings it all to the table. <br />

Soo... If you have something against Classic players is it not in your best interest that they don't play on Modern servers with you? Isn't this to your benefit too? You literally won't have to play with these people, why cry? &quot;Oh, you all bitch about Modern WoW!&quot;.. and? You will see it less in game since they'll spend the estimated &quot;Couple of weeks&quot; on Classic servers then quit so you don't have to see them again. This is literally the best outcome for you. Not only for the masses you suggest will quit, you will be able to say &quot;Told you so&quot; but the others that don't enjoy it or Modern WoW will drop off the face of Activision/Blizzard servers. You literally win in this situation no matter what.</div></div><hr />
