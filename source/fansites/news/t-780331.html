Some women (and guys) like getting attention that way, regardless of whether or not it's 'good' or 'bad' attention.</div></div><hr />

Maybe. <br />
But then again: If these women wear costumes like that in REAL-LIFE public... why are they demonstrating for more closed female armor INGAME?</div></div><hr />

A big announcement would have been nice, but Blizzcon isn't intended as a marketing event, it's a community event. I think people have become used to Blizzard always making some earth shattering announcement, but that hasn't always happened at Blizzcon's in the past. I had an absolute blast being there, the atmosphere alone was worth the price of admission. Just the line to get in on Friday morning was beyond epic, but everything went very smoothly. Getting to see the people who are behind the games in person is pretty damn cool, and watching the greatest band in the world play was just icing on top.</div></div><hr />

The woman who won the Costume Competition was hot, but she was fully clothed (Diablo III - Female Monk).<br />
<br />
She even took a dig at one of the other contestants for wearing basically a red-thong and calling herself a &quot;Blood Elf&quot;.<br />
<br />
These &quot;women&quot; are essentially emo-gaming-sluts, and are plentiful on the internet.<br />
<br />
They feel the need to show off their body (even when its nothing special - just normal [read: not fat]) and sleep with everyone, because that is the only way they get any attention.</div></div><hr />

blizzcon probably was the only place they could get attention with their so called hawt bodies :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed.<br />
<br />
Most of them are just average, not hot at all.<br />
<br />
The woman dressed as Diablo III Monk was hot though... but then again, i couldnt see her body under al her clothes.<br />
<br />
Some things are best left to the imagination.</div></div><hr />

This has been the case since WotLK.<br />

B) Many guilds have worked hours to get the incoming damage stable. Much of Cho'galls incoming damage is avoidable, meaning that once the raid knows how to step out of everything bad, damage won't be a wiping factor. Stupid people standing in stuff (think Defile) will wipe you.</div></div><hr />

Not entirely true.<br />
<br />
There were many people that dressed up in good costumes that required you to WEAR CLOTHES.<br />
<br />
We are complaining about the women that wore JUST a thong and a bra and then claim to be a &quot;Blood Elf&quot;, who have average bodies.<br />
<br />
If they were larger women wearing the bra and panties, then i would be all for it... not because im a chubby chaser but for the exact reason you said about being comfortable in your own skin.<br />
<br />
These were extremely &quot;average&quot; people who feel they are extremely &quot;hot&quot; and therefore try to show off and flaunt their bodies in just underwear.<br />
<br />
Don't think we are saying &quot;FAT PEOPLE SHOULDNT GET NAKED ON STAGE, EW GROSS&quot;, because we arn't.<br />
<br />
It's the average looking emo-gaming-sluts that we are talking about.</div></div><hr />

I agree they shouldn't be wearing that stuff just to get attention, it isn't tasteful.. but it's because you would be embarrassed? Really?

They feel the need to show off their body (even when its nothing special - just normal [read: not fat]) and sleep with everyone, because that is the only way they get any attention.<br />
Don't you think most of addict gamers are like that? I don't mind some random short term relations. And if my partner like wow or works in global positioning researching or development industry, we have something to talk about besides movies, books and war in Afghanistan.<br />

That's solely because things were done right. If you mess up at any point earlier, then there's a massive snowballing effect and your raid will die well before the boss dies. It's also normal mode, which is tuned for PUGs and the likes, but still there's no-one else who has killed it so far.</div></div><hr />

I'm from the UK (therefore, included in Europe).<br />

You are getting confused between Sluts and Whores.<br />

Whores = Sex for monetary gain.<br />

Sluts = Sex for attention.<br />

I think the ones where the effort was obvious in the costume they wore were okay. I agree that most well known female lore characters wear skimpy armor, but even those make it obvious from the really well done costumes and the &quot;okay&quot; ones. The spirit healer is a good example, her wings were so well done I didn't pay any attention to the fact she was wearing so little.<br />
<br />
Loved the Illidan costume though, but if they put a ramp and stairs in for the next blizzcon costume event they better have strong men on hand to carry everyone off stage!<br />

Concentrating on Cata, when nearly all info was known kind-a-lame.<br />
<br />
Dude. The game releases in a month. They couldn't possibly have held on to all the details till now. Beta would have been pointless wandering around in a empty world wondering what cool things might be there later. Testing would have been impossible. They're between games right now, Cata is all but out, SCII *is* out, and DIII isn't quite ready for prime time yet.

I'm sure this has been pointed out already, but:<br />
<br />
1) It's an entry-level raid. It should be on a par with KT in Naxx, or, at most difficult, Prince in Kara. Yes, there should be stuff to not stand in, but it should NOT be Sindragosa difficulty.<br />
2) It's normal mode. Which nowadays means it's meant for PUGS.<br />
3) It's Paragon. If they can't kill this kinda stuff, it's grossly overtuned.</div></div><hr />

Since healers started getting iceblocked / casting debuff all the way through phase 3, perhaps? It's always that &quot;???&quot; bit that causes the most problems...<br />
Although I'll agree that since the 30% buff and patch 4.0.1 even sindra hc has got a bit easy...</div></div><hr />

Healers getting iceblocked is a RNG issue, not a skill issue.<br />
<br />
And why are you talking about HC mode? We are talking about Normal - Cho'gall heroic isnt available on beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Getting off-topic here, but anyway...<br />
<br />
Sindra hc now is about as difficult as it was normal mode at the start, mostly due to player hp increase from the 30% buff and patch(meaning the raid can survive longer without heals) and dps increase (shorter phase 3).<br />
And healers getting iceblocked is a DESIGN issue as much as an RNG one (I never said it had anything to do with skill, it just makes the boss harder). I'm sure Blizzard are perfectly capable of making it so that only those that are doing dps to the dragon will get hit... I mean, they could have it select only the 2nd to 7th player on aggro for iceblock and magic debuffs, that'd work. That would have made phase 3 considerably easier, and therefore the entire encounter easier.<br />
<br />
That said, there's nothing wrong with RNG on the last boss or so, even on entry-level content. KT had lethal iceblocks, Prince had all his infernals landing around the room, not to mention his tank-destroying parry and thrash. But my point was that neither approach Sindra in terms of difficulty.<br />
I think people are expecting the first Cata raids to be a continuation in difficulty from ICC, but from what we've seen in the past, it's unlikely. First tier bosses tend to be PUGable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe people like to dress up as their favorite in game character and it's nothing more than that. It's not like they're wearing an armor suit they probably spent months making out clubbing. It's blizzcon and the costumes are judged on the quality of the suit and not the person wearing it.<br />
<br />
And don't bring up your own woman on forums. Chances are there is someone here who has a way hotter girl but they don't feel the need to brag.</div></div><hr />

sadly in the 10 man heroic version you can zerk her just need 1 tank 2 healers 7 dps and atack her without destroying any iceblock ( well i destroyed 2 iceblocks) but noone moves to reset the debuff or stop castin because of the unchained just kill her and put a SS on your only tank and she is dead.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they want to give out info on that yet. So again we're back to &quot;manufacture bullshit announcements&quot; or &quot;Blizzcon is slightly less interesting this year&quot;. They chose &quot;b&quot;. Next year will probably be highly DIII focused (and maybe some info on the new MMO, they've had thing under tight wraps for a really long time).</div></div><hr />

The thing is, once they start giving information about it, people start getting anxious. The more people get anxious, the more Blizz gets spammed with idiots trying to weasel out more information, so it's understandable that they'd like to keep it behind closed doors while it's in very early development. Not letting out any information also prevents a lot of stress on the dev team, I'm sure.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, holy crap I thought that picture of a summoning stone was someone in costume, but on closer inspection it appears to just be a prop. If it WAS a person in costume, that person would be my new hero.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Second</div><div class="date">2010-10-25, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe. <br />
But then again: If these women wear costumes like that in REAL-LIFE public... why are they demonstrating for more closed female armor INGAME? I dont think they are. Its Blizzcon after all.<br />
Its just insulting for something to be successfull it needs naked (half naked) slim woman (read model) behind it. Really, take a look around your world and you notice how normal women look like. There are some really nice projects being shown on Youtube how women pictures are &quot;shaped&quot; to fit current view of beauty, undercutting this &quot;VS catalogue pick up&quot; for WoW.<br />
Nothing wrong with women trying to look beauty or sexy tho, but keep in mind your perception of beauty can be shaped by all the adds out there.</div></div><hr />

I believe that's what they're saying. And it's true. Since that merger their game output/quality has plummeted even more. Now they're out for some smash-n-grab cash, and not about releasing quality products. Wow, that makes Valve the only savior left for PC gaming, and that's worrisome at best anymore too. PC gaming may actually &quot;die&quot; finally.<br />

If it were true then tickets wouldn't be as outrageous in price, which they are, so they can make yet another profit off their fans. Don't let the blind-love for Blizzard fool you. They could have easily talked 10minutes about their Next-gen MMO that their &quot;A-team&quot; is working on. You know the game where their best talent is, their focus as well, which is why WoW has been degrading over the past years.</div></div><hr />

Wow isn't exactly known for it's characters to look like the average women running around. Most of their &quot;well known&quot; characters all have skimpy armor:P<br />
<br />
For me I think it's great people out there have enough confidence to wear what they like and not care what people think of them, we need more of that, today people are made to feel so insecure about their bodies cause it doesn't match up to what &quot;society&quot; thinks it should.<br />
<br />
So thanks guys for having the courrage to actually go do something fun and enjoy doing it! Live and let live.<br />
<br />
Gonna agree with this. There is nothing wrong with girls wanting to dress skimpy, regardless of how they look physically , I'm sure every girl at one point or another has wanted to dress up and feel &quot;sexy&quot;.<br />
<br />
Plus cosplay isn't a cult like it is in countries like Japan. So I'm willing to bet alot of the people who dressed up and entered just wanted to have fun and experience something different from their average everyday life. With that said, these people wouldn't spend months on end with a huge budget for accuracy (like the cosplayers in Japan), cause fact is, as some has pointed out. The costume worn by the NPC in-game, sometimes define the law of reality and most of the conventional methods of DIY projects by your average person, with little to no experience of sewing isn't going to capture your imagination, and certainly isn't worth the effort, unless they are passionate about it.<br />
<br />
Point is, stop being so judgmental and enjoy the show. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing WRONG with judging the costumes (that's expected in a contest), but it is UNACCEPTABLE to judge and label the people in them (regardless of how skimpy, uncreative or physically horrid), because you know absolutely nothing about that person.</div></div><hr />

And to those guys complaining about the costume contest. Get real. There is nothing wrong in dressing up and go on stage. Do you expect only models going up there?

Blizzcon felt like a let-down this year.<br />
<br />
Way too much filler content, not enough &quot;NEW SHINY THINGS&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion...<br />
<br />
If think it was bad this year just wait til next year when they don't even have a Diablo 3 class to announce... They said that they probably won't announce the new MMO til 2012 so that leaves us with hardly anything... maybe a preview of Heart of the Swarm or an announcement of the next WoW expansion but who knows...</div></div><hr />

WoW, Cho'gall looks grossly undertuned....for 80% of the fight, if you watch the health bars, no one is remotely close to dying....the boss appears to do a soft enrage at 20% that catches the healers off guard but other than that it looks about as challenging as a wet noodle...pretty disappointing (regardless of the fact that it was a top guild doing it)<br />
<br />
You are judging that by the worlds most prominent guild taking him on? Some people... seriously.<br />

I normally don't post untill I see other people posting something offensive, sexist or just plain stupid.<br />
So:<br />
<br />
Right...<br />
This is the reason why a lot of girls have low self-esteem. Guys trying to push them into a corner of &quot;Do not express yourself in a non-conforming way&quot;.<br />
<br />
Let these girls do whatever they want. Is it SO hard to believe they actually LIKE dressing up and do crazy ? <br />
<br />
I bet 99% who complain about them, wish they had girlfriends wearing skimpy clothes and had bodies like some of the contestants.<br />
<br />
But I also bet this is one of the points which separates boys from men.<br />
<br />
.<br />
Probably, I am feeding trolls with this. But hey, it needed to be said so the boys can learn a lesson or two about how to treat women properly.</div></div><hr />
