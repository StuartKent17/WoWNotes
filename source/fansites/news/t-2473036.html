As the war in Azeroth rages on, the champions of the Horde and the Alliance look to their in-game friends for help. Whether it’s levelling up for experience, gearing up for combat, or mounting up to see the world, World of Warcraft is always best enjoyed in groups, however big or small. If you have guildmates, friends, or family who haven’t been in Azeroth for a while, let them know they can play for free this weekend.<br />

People can't read. If you don't own BfA you can play BfA content for 3 hours or until you complete the intro scenario.<br />
If you own Bfa you can play it whole weekend. If you don't own BfA then you can play whole weekend up to Legion.</div></div><hr />

Mate look at the caveat. If you already own it then it's full duration.<br />

To try and push the expansion on them. It's a really scumbag thing to do and they know it. Especially when they say &quot;HEY WHILE YOU ARE BACK TAKE A LOOK AT OUT SALES GUYS&quot;.<br />

<br />
It's much sillier than that! It ends once you've completed the intro quest for BFA. So assuming it puts you at the very start of BFA, for a horde character you do the Battle of Lordaeron, get your Heart of Azeroth, break Talanji out of Stormwind, escort her through Dazar'alor and establish your base at the Great Seal. <br />
<br />
So unless you hold off on turning in the last quest, you don't even get to explore any of the zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is only the BFA trial that is limited (and only for people without the expansion already). The other expansions are for the full period.<br />
<br />
Also, this is the second trial weekend they have had since BFA was released. There was nothing similar done during Legion (I believe I saw people being offered trials but it wasn't an open-to-everyone trial like the two in BFA have been). That smacks of trying to get subs back (nothing wrong with trying to get players back but this seems more desperate than what they've done prior to BFA).</div></div><hr />

Never before have I been avoiding current content in an expansion so much, and from what I have seen, I'm not the only one to do so.<br />
<br />
They should start by making missions more lucrative. At least one super useful/valuable mission daily, and improve all gold mission rewards by 1000% at least. All other missions should also be more rewarding. And while at missions, improve follower gear significantly, that is supposed to bring extra rewards. I've never seen any of my guys with &quot;Chance to bring X from missions&quot; bring anything back.<br />
<br />
Then to make island expeditions more interesting, give all rare elites a chance to drop something. Maybe a loot bag with with a very large list of possible loot. And maybe first mission of the day should give a high quality loot bag upon completion.<br />

No they should just remove the mission table once and for all. Play mobile games if you want those things.</div></div><hr />

The fact is that it is easier to maintain a current customer than trying to bribe an old one back, so throwing some free game time at me will not work when the game is just a fading shadow of its former self.<br />

Why do you care if you hate the game ?It is not hate, it is passion. <br />
<br />
I do not hate the game at all, I still love it and what is used to be. Remember the old ethos that Bliz had, &quot;release it when it is ready&quot;, now it is based on a timetable.<br />
<br />
I truly hope that one day Bliz can go back to developing the game focused on fun and not profit.</div></div><hr />

You don't understand. FFXIV gives 3 day sub every quarter (if you've been unsubbed for three months) because our lord and saviour Yoshi-P is so in touch with playerbase, while Activision Blizzard does it with BfA trial on top of it because they are evil corporate machine that never listens to the players.

Aye it's sad how Blizzard keep taking more and more features that were part of the expansions in the past from day 1 and either timegating them or putting them behind RNG.<br />
<br />
What's even sadder is the people defending it. It goes beyond the point of enjoying the game.<br />
<br />
Least I'll be able to make my Viera when FF14 Shadowbringers comes out later this year. No stupid timegating to make it. And at least I'll be able to unlock flying with ease once I hit 80.</div></div><hr />

Well 2 I highly recommend are ESO and FF14.<br />
<br />
Great communities, decent games, dev teams that give a damn about the product and so on.<br />
<br />
If you want something in the F2P market well I can recommend Neverwinter. It's grindy as hell and a bit P2W but still decent overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FF14 has a free trial to 35 and ESO is B2P and tbh just get the sub for that because it's decent value.<br />
<br />
In terms of the community once you get settled in and find guilds/free companies etc you'll get quite the culture shock.<br />
<br />
Neverwinter however you have to put a bit of legwork in. If you have a PS4 I'd say get it on that as it seems it has a good chunk of the playerbase.<br />

Ah yes the good old argument of &quot;its not wow so it sucks&quot;. So compelling.... :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
And yeah the 3 hour limit is there to push people to buy the expansion by heavily restricting their free time if they don't own BFA. Let's not pretend otherwise shall we?</div></div><hr />

That's not even the desperate part.<br />
<br />
They purposely limited the expansion time to 3 hours if you don't own it to basically try and push sales. That is the desperate part.<br />

Best thing about it is that it's the exact same trial they offered back in Oct. They didn't even bother extending the access to try and get unsubbed accounts that go up to Legion interested in the new expansion by exploring the first zone.</div></div><hr />

I love the part that you have to pay for a sub just for the chore of grinding them through over 10 years old content or for the privilege paying to get them to level (But then the shiny outfit, can't give them that). Sub races are inane in their implementation, even more so with the amount you pay to level them.</div></div><hr />

First both game are vastly diferents, and ppl tent to prize them and they have as much issues as WoW have.<br />
<br />
FF14 is a huge impact for a western player, since the game play and feel like any Asian MMO. So is hard to get used to it, and the game have as much time gatting as WoW.<br />
<br />
And ESO is more close to SWKOTOR that wow, that game is heavy SP more that MMO, and story drive. On Eso you can spend your days playing w/o grouping with other, and just join a party to do a dungoen. <br />
<br />
No MMO out there right now is doing well. The golden age of MMO is over.</div></div><hr />

LOL.<br />
<br />
FF14 does not have as much timegating as WoW. Please stop spreading blatant misinformation. The only thing timegated is the final content patch split up into 2 parts. And no it does not play like any Asian MMO such as Aion or Tera. Or BDO. Those games have insane mindless grinds that usually end up with you forking money over to alleviate it better.<br />
<br />
As for ESO. Being SP driven is not a bad thing. It has plenty of group content.<br />
<br />
And no. There are MMOs out there doing well. Your idea of well seems to be that it has to have more players than WoW. Which is a load of nonsense.<br />
<br />
But of course it's hard to take you seriously when you are just posting misinformation about other games to make WoW appear better. I'll just stop because there's no point even having a discussion because you will just want to only see one side of it. Good day.<br />
<br />
Never understood why when someone looks for a different game to play people come in and try to detract them with why WoW is objectively superior in their eyes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This company sadly has started to fall so far from grace as of late.<br />
<br />
That's the point. They put the expansion on sale. Likely didn't work as well as they hoped for. So they handle out a free weekend but then limit the trial for the expansion to three hours(which is like nothing. Definitely not enough to experience all the downsides of it). If 1 hook doesn't work, try 2.</div></div><hr />

I feel the same. I'll login for two reasons - first to keep my character names (I believe you have to log in once an expansion or something). Second to check out explosive shot. See if that gives back the SV in MM they promised pre-Legion. Somehow I doubt it.<br />

<br />
Much better story than Legion.<br />
<br />
The problem is, its timegated and only people diggin the ptr do know whats coming, i mean all the stuff after the silly faction war.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatley the rest still sucks, but there are plans to remove some of the azerite nonsense in 8.2. and flying will be availible again.<br />
<br />
If you are not interested in any pvp activity, you are better off in 8.2. thats for sure. <br />
<br />
Id say current state of the game is only good if you do warmode and enjoy it, faction incursions and no flying its a bonus actually for warmode.<br />
<br />
So, actually not everything is that bad as people believe - however, even warmode would be much better with artefact weapons and legendaries, instead of silly and harshly nerfed azerite traits that feel dumb on gear.<br />
<br />
I wonder who thought this up anyways and how it got through the alpha.<br />
<br />
The offer in itself is a complete joke nowdays. should give p layers a free month of everything till legion and 1 week BFA unrestricted in everyway. Because how the situation currently is within the game and tokens to buy gametime.<br />
<br />
Activision/blizz should fire their business division, if they need free space, because that particular offer looks overconfident for how the situation really is.<br />
<br />
The game in itself is indeed very empty i do not need to read numbers or read complains, just play the game on live servers.<br />
<br />
In particular as far as the EU servers goes, the german ones once still full in legion are now depopulated in such a way, that random bgs hardly ever happen anymore. English servers got a hit, too, but nothing devastating in comparission.<br />
<br />
The arrogant part of blizz is, that they think they can still be confident enough to put restrictions on &quot;free&quot; offers, in such a apocalyptic situation(on some language servers)<br />
<br />
And this is no salt, that is the harsh reality of an aged game in an expansion where developers had fucked up and still need to repair what got broken, no significant change is going to happen till 8.2., and when this releases we have summertime and better stuff to do.</div></div><hr />

I'll log on just to get some marginal gear upgrades for my 2 most important characters from the WQ map, casually, just in case 8.2 is actually fun. After that I'm gone again. <br />
<br />
WoW can't afford to suck and coast on its reputation like during the bad times in Cata and even WoD. We live in an era with more games and overall distractions than ever before. And unlike the last 2 &quot;big dips&quot; in WoW's content history, even in the increasingly old and niche genre of MMORPGs there are now clearly better options to choose from depending on your style (FFXIV, ESO, GW2 at least for a single go around).</div></div><hr />

Aye. For me the first thing I jumped from WoW to was GW2 (I ain't counting FF14 1.0 with how much it sucked lol)<br />

<br />
It would be tough to justify BFA's purchase even if WoW went fully B2P now and they have the cojones to try this. I hope older, returning players see the blatant WQ/Pathfinder/Allied Race treadmill and this continues the negative snowball effect until some higher-up Activision heads roll.</div></div><hr />

Not even 3 hours actually, just Lordaeron scenario, getting HoA, some intro quests on KT/Zandalar (I did only Alliance and there was only prison break and a little bit of talking) and choosing your first zone. After that game just locks you out of the character. And that's not even hour of content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly after playing GW2 and FF14 it's a complete culture shock at how friendly people are. Sure there are still toxic people but it's an absolute minority.<br />
<br />
You're really dedicated to this thread, which is weird since you appear to really dislike Blizzard as well as the game. <br />
<br />
I've personally played Rift, dropped out because endgame was boring af. Tried GW2, also boring af endgame (though haven't tried the expansions), Tried Final Fantasty, not into the whole japanese anime lolicon artstyle. Haven't tried ESO since I despise the combat system in Elder Scrolls games, and it looked quite similar. Also tried Tera which was even worse than FF when it comes to that japanese kiddy artstyle. Ugh. <br />
<br />
GW2 felt like a singleplayer game. Different experiences, I guess.</div></div><hr />

Considering you can only do upto a specific quest with those 3 hours which doesn't even take an hour to get you no you can't with BFA.<br />

It's just their usual scummy way of pushing box sales. Whether you want to believe it or not.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand why you would call that scummy. They are a company. Companies make money by selling their product. It's been a bit since BfA came out, time for a free trial so people that didn't buy it can try it out and see if they want to buy it. Would be nice if you could do this with every game, I lost count of how many games I had to return on Steam because they gave me motion sickness within 10 minutes.</div></div><hr />

You can only do upto a specific quest which barely takes half an hour to get to. 1/6 of said time.<br />
<br />
They literally did that to push expansions sales. It's barely trying it out. <br />
<br />
There is zero issue with giving people 3 full days of access to BFA whether they own it or not. But Blizzard gotta have that money to claim Q1 was another good quarter for them.</div></div><hr />

Duh, they want to have another good quarter. THEY ARE A COMPANY, not your best pals inventing playground games during recess exclusively so you can have some fun. If you already own the game, THIS WEEKEND IS NOT AIMED AT YOU. So ignore it. It lets new (and returning) players see the graphics and gameplay, experience some of the new story, and how classes handle this go around. It is solely aimed to get people to buy the game. After you buy it, congratulations, you can play the whole thing and see the rest of it. That's how a trial works, like the samples at Costco. You get to taste a bit, decide you want to buy a bag, go home and cook/eat/enjoy the whole bag. Why would you expect to go to the store and be given a full five-course meal to decide if you like it their food or not?</div></div><hr />

For shame! A company that gives multiple hours to complete something that takes a short time to get to thereby letting people experience multiple play through a on different characters and factions in an attempt to get people interested to purchase a game. How awful!<br />
Anymore, all you preach about is when a company does anything to get sales/money they are evil. Oh wait, that’s just Blizzard in your eyes. Your precious FF mmo is exempt even though they have even more grinding, it has time gating, and even Recruit a Friend to get people to sub. Yet none of that is bad because it’s not Blizzard.<br />
If you hate something, that’s fine, but don’t be hypocritical about it.</div></div><hr />

Just play the game and earn it guys, putting a huge grind behind making a new character makes total 100% sense. You guys are sooooo entitled, I can't believe you want new races just handed to you for buying a new expansion like they've always been for over a decade in this game.

As someone who used to dislike FF14 and is currently fed up with current WoW, do it, you won't regret it, trust me. I can't believe I ever disliked this game. Imagine a better looking WoW with way more abilities, and you can play any class you want at any time on the same character without being punished for it. And you can do all of the crafting professions, and they're all actually interesting. And that's not even mentioning the super friendly and welcoming community. If you're looking for a MMO to replace WoW because you're tired of all of the time gating in WoW, it's honestly the best replacement I've found so far.</div></div><hr />

it has nothing to do with entitlement. My point, which you missed entirely, is in reply to the people saying &quot;but it's fine for Blizzard to try to get people to buy BfA!!!' <br />
<br />
Yes, it is. And the better way to have done that would be to let people who haven't yet bought it to just play it the entire weekend. They're even more involved, even more sucked in at that point. <br />
<br />
The way they're doing it just feels, as does most of what they do now, like a big FUCK YOU to the very people whom they want to play the game. it's chintzy and cheap. <br />
<br />
&quot; For people who've not yet bought BfA, you can play all weekend and get as far as you want. If you want to buy the expansion it will be on sale for the next week. If, next time you activate your sub, you haven't bought BfA your progress will be reset to where it was before this weekend.&quot;<br />

They're aren't though. It's the exact same &quot;trial&quot; back from in Oct which allowed you to either play on your old characters in Legion or create a new trial character at 110, do the class tutorial and then the Lordaeron assault scenario which you could already do on your old characters. The only taste you get of the new expansion is doing the unlock quests for the Allied Races from Legion if you have the requirements done already (and then can only play a new Allied Race character until the welcome back period is up or if you buy BfA) and literally taking a step into Dazar'alor or Borealus before it ends.</div></div><hr />

Except Blizz has done free weekends before on other products and I’m sure their research afterwards has demonstrated how much people buy afterwards. <br />
Also, as someone who has worked in marketing for decades I’m sure you realize the differences between a taste for the product vs an entire meal. Bearing in mind you work in product marketing, which I’m not sure because I thought you said you did something different in a different forum, you also understand that different mediums have different marketing tactics, and again, Blizz has their own marketing strategies that they follow. Let’s also not make any mistakes here, over the course of a weekend, anyone who wanted to play die hard has 72 hours to experience the story this far. Considering outside of raiding, even a casual has more than enough time to experience the roughly 8–12 hours of story we’ve gotten, then no, Blizz would not have sold more as all that’s left is instanced content.<br />
Before you misunderstand me, I’m saying roughly 8-12 hours of story this far, not total. When you include instanced content such as PvP, raids, and dungeons, as well as gearing up, there is a lot of time you can spend in game, as well as the xpac still going. Rather not have people jump in about a $50 game with a sub fee only offering a short story.</div></div><hr />

New races still locked behind time gating mechanics?<br />
<br />
Looks like I'm not coming back and still gonna play better MMOs out there.<br />
<br />
Apparently, &quot;playing better MMOs out there&quot; translates to still spending all free time whining about the game on MMO-C to some. :rolleyes:<br />

Wow... 2 whole days for a game that should have gone Free to Play years ago, so generous. Though maybe I'm just bitter because I work on weekends. I'd love to work on Pathfinder 2 or something... but you know... gotta gate that gating behind more gating. Oh well, atleast I can finish the raid and roll a Kul'tiran and Zandalari toon I'll never play and log out without playing in the few hours I'll have, so theres that. That gift horse, I'm looking it right in it's damned mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should've gone Free To Play years ago&quot;... Um, according to you.<br />
<br />
If the game remains profitable, why change the business model? I can promise you, from experience, that a F2P business model would end up costing us more in the end. No matter how much I've enjoyed F2P titles, I've been driven away without fail due to the money schemes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I'm just bitter&quot; seems about right for most on these forums though.<br />

This doesn’t even make sense, if you have been unsubed for any decent amount of time you wouldn’t even have the allied races unlocked.<br />

You sound like an idiot because you're not even understanding the basic point... which is that Blizzard would have sold more by letting people play it for the entire weekend.

<br />
Exactly. A 3 hour trial of what is basically a class trial and sod all is not going to help them shift expansions sales.<br />
<br />
Literally nobody here has given a valid reason why for the weekend it cannot be full access to 3 days of BFA whether you own it or not.<br />
<br />
But of course Blizzard can do no wrong to some people.<br />

I wouldn't let this guy deliver pizza to me. He would show up at the door, eat half of what I ordered, and then shout about how I felt entitled to my food :-P<br />

I actually had that once. Guy who delivered it ended up losing his job because the place I order from I'm a part owner in. :D</div></div><hr />

Yes, it's so scummy that they're giving people a free trial of their game that lasts either 3 hours or up to a certain point.<br />
<br />
I saw those goal posts shift.<br />
<br />
<br />
Except Blizz has done free weekends before on other products and I’m sure their research afterwards has demonstrated how much people buy afterwards. <br />
Also, as someone who has worked in marketing for decades I’m sure you realize the differences between a taste for the product vs an entire meal. Bearing in mind you work in product marketing, which I’m not sure because I thought you said you did something different in a different forum, you also understand that different mediums have different marketing tactics, and again, Blizz has their own marketing strategies that they follow.

<br />
This may be a bit arbitrary but considering during the last few months of Legion around the end of June they allowed about 6-7 days of freeplay, access to Legion if you hadn't bought it yet and including all the stuff in 7.3, they reported in the following Earnings report that they had even higher MAUs and that pre-orders for BfA had risen significantly since the previous one citing that period as having an effect. Since they're not even giving a taste of the new expansion in comparison to the &quot;meal&quot; of Legion, I can see why it's not getting those that haven't bought the current expansion yet hooked as such.</div></div><hr />

Virtually no one is going to spend 72 straight hours playing and not sleep or eat so that's an irrelevant number. The point is that with the 3 hour intro quest being the only BfA content someone can try, they can't really see BfA at all. They don't get to see the zones, the capital cities. etc. it does little to give you a feel for BfA that makes you want to continue.<br />
<br />
Realistically, if someone hardcores it for the weekend they'll likely play 8-12 hours for the 3 days. On the high end, that's 36 hours... which is not likely to get them to 120 (yes, a few people can do it in that time, but most won't). And even if they do ding 120... that makes them MORE likely to buy, right? They just invested that much effort, they're almost certain to buy vs not whereas a 3 hour taste? Easily something a person can discount. <br />
<br />
Of course, there are alternate choices that they could have made, too. For example, they could have said &quot;Play all weekend or up to level 112 (or 115 or whatever)&quot;. <br />
<br />
As for what I do... Over the course of my working life I've done product marketing (and management), program management and some software development. I've spent my adult life in the software field, thanks.</div></div><hr />

I never said people are going to spend 72 hours playing. I said a free weekend gives people 72 hours to experience a current storyline that is maybe 8-12 hours long. Blizzard would basically be giving away the entire open world story away for free, not just a taste to get people interested. The only thing left would be instanced content, like I stated, and people that just want the story would have no reason to bother with the game.<br />
You then move your goalposts to “level to 112.” Realistically this is maybe an extra hour or 2, if that, over the 3 people have. The fact you changed your stance shows that even your original line of thought has some questioning ideas behind it.<br />
Not everything is so black and white as people originally make it out to be.</div></div><hr />

I'm not &quot;ignoring the rest of his post&quot;, so piss off with that. The rest of his post is purely inconsequential and serves no point. You can bitch and whine about how stupid a 3 hour/up to a certain point demo is, but all it is is whining about a free demo. Blizzard didn't even have to give a demo, but they did anyways. Like, I'm the first and loudest to criticize Blizzard but this is just dumbass whining.<br />
<br />
For the record, I think the demo is pretty stupid too but I'm not about to fucking cry about it and scream and piss about how &quot;greedy&quot; (lolwhat) it is or how &quot;scummy&quot; it is or how Blizzard is &quot;deceiving&quot; people or how people are &quot;wrong&quot; to pass the demo off as fine. You all need to groooooow the fuuuuuuuck up. There's about a million other things with this game that are worthy of complaint, you need to conserve your tears for things that have some medicorum of purpose. All of this limpdick rage over a motherfucking demo, it's unreal. Did you kids scream at your parents when they brought you home those demo discs for the PS1?<br />

Yes but your argument was that if people get to eat some of the meal rather than a taste or not at all then they won't want the rest and I was just pointing out that the exact scenario happened at the end of Legion when Blizzard wanted people to sub back and also buy BfA and the result was people stayed for the rest of the meal and wanted Dessert too.

<br />
But you have no proof of that. People buying an xpac because it’s new happens. It’s been proven thru the history of the game. Neither you, nor I, can prove that people stuck around or even purchased BfA because of Legion being offered as a whole. What can be done, however, is that looking to evidence of past cycles that people bought BfA for the same reason they’ve ever bought any xpac. Many players resub at the end of an xpac to get ready for the next release.<br />
The point stands that Legion was at the end of its cycle. It makes sense to release a full xpac at that time as a weekend event as people can play it in its entirety to get ready for the next xpac. Legion was not released in its entirety at any other point during its cycle.<br />
