Battleground Win Ratios<br />
I'll bring it up in our next developer meeting, but in all likelihood, since that could potentially dramatically impact queue times for random Battlegrounds, it probably won't fly.<br />
<br />
[...] I said that there would be a greater emphasis on creating new Battlegrounds on the future. I should note that we're slowly working toward new technology to make the creation and modification of battlegrounds something we can do more readily too. <br />
<br />
I also might have made it sound like the older Battlegrounds will never change again. That's not what I meant to get across. We've redone AV several times throughout the years, and it may see more changes in the future. I just wanted to note that the emphasis is going to be shifted a bit, that's all.

<br />
It's pretty much all up to the developers. They have a word with QA to bring up the PTR so they can throw the patch to the general player for generalized public testing.<br />
<br />
They have their own QA team that can test things just fine but unfortunately they can't always replicate the conditions you get in the Live environment simply because of economies of scale - a possible test bed of over 10 million players will always trump w/e size of QA testing team Blizzard can field.</div></div><hr />

That's not really what he was getting at. Why do we need the test servers for such a minor patch, and who the hell will test half of those changes anyway? Who would go to the PTR with their raiding guild, just to test the hit box in the final phase of HC rag? Infact the real ID changes can't be used on the PTR anyway.<br />

The point is, this PTR is ... strange, and effectively pointless. They have changed more than this on-the-fly without the PTR.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if serious, but: The size of Ragnaros' hit box during the final phase of the Heroic encounter has been increased.<br />

Is this not a nerf? Am I the crazy one here?</div></div><hr />

It practically just means that Melees can stand further away from the boss and still hit him. It might indirectly be a slight nerf, because it's easier for meeles to dps the boss, but I doubt that this makes any difference in this encounter. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah that one is annoying. You can prevent the problem by first dismounting before entering an instance though. The problem is only when you're on a flying mount and your pet is in limbo.<br />
<br />
It's part of the pet problems we got, like pets not running at max mount speed when you enter combat for whatever reason, after they reenabled pets sticking around when mounted. They disabled that years ago *because* of the problems we have now. My guess is that they reenabled it because they couldn't fix the low hp of the pet after dismounting (gets back up to max after a sec, but the initial low hp is enough in RBG to be royally screwed). But that's just speculation.<br />
<br />
I for one would love the wotlk style pet limbo on any mount back. The 1 sec low hp I can live with. Disappearing pet bars and pets lagging behind when mounted are just plain annoying.</div></div><hr />

No way... second client patch (4.2 -&gt; 4.2a -&gt; 4.2.2) since Firelands released and IT STILL SOUNDS LIKE A GUN??<br />

Thats all he was saying, why waste time with a bug patch on the ptr instead of releasing 4.2 on the ptr. If 4.3 isnt ready then it cant be tested, complaining about the bug patch being on the ptr isnt going to make 4.3 magically come sooner.</div></div><hr />

Adding new code often breaks others, so even if it looks insignificant, there is probably a reason behind it.<br />
<br />
Eventhough i still hoped they would have addressed more then this, their fewer bigger patches approach is keeping the dominating classes on top and the dominated classes at the bottom.</div></div><hr />
