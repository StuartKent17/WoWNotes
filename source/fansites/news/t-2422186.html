Developer Interview - Faction Identity<br />
Polygon had the opportunity to talk to Steve Danuser (Narrative Producer) and Ely Cannon (Lead Artist). <br />
<br />
<br />
What the Horde stands for has changed over time. Is it a group driven by honor and courage or a disparate collection of outcasts that nobody will align themselves with.<br />
Battle for Azeroth is an opportunity to look at both sides that have made up the Horde storylines throughout the years and pull them together.<br />
It may be a chance for the Horde to look inward and become something new and stronger.<br />
Sylvanas and Saurfang are embodying the other aspects of what the Horde was.<br />
To get to the future of the Horde, we have to face the Horde’s past.<br />
The Alliance has its share of disparity and there's going to be a self-examination of what the Alliance is about and how they want to behave.<br />
Does the Alliance want to get revenge on the Horde, or do they want to build a better world?<br />
There is room for what the Alliance and Horde represent to evolve and change and for their relationship to change.<br />
Player's identity is very much tied to their faction and the things they have done for it, so it wouldn't be something the team would take away lightly. <br />
This expansion focuses on shaping what the factions mean in the world and how they interact with one another.<br />

Arena World Championship<br />
Announcing the 2018 Arena World Championship Fall Season<br />
As conflict burns in the Battle for Azeroth, the power of the greatest Horde and Alliance heroes ignites. If you think you have what it takes to prove your PvP skills are among the best in the world, signups are now open for the first Cup of the Fall Season of the 2018 Arena World Championship (AWC).<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CtuA162mlVc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
The Arena World Championship is a 3v3 tournament that takes place in the iconic battlegrounds of Azeroth. In this Fall Season, we are introducing Mugambala and Hook Point, two asymmetrical arenas which were released in the Battle for Azeroth expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/arena1.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/arena1.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/arena2.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/arena2.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
Mugambala is set in Zandalar, a region that was once a part of ancient Kalimdor and the birthplace of troll civilization. This arena features an upper level, and a lower level with a large pillar in the middle.<br />
<br />
Hook Point is an area in Boralus, where only the bravest battle for the right to call themselves true Kul Tirans! It features four pillars for players to dance around—one with a shark hanging from it—and two smaller pillars.<br />
<br />
This season, there are six Cups up for grabs—three in North American and three in Europe—each with a prize pool of $10,000 and an increased amount of AWC points on offer, more than any season this year!<br />
<br />
No Arena ranking is required for teams of three to four people to sign up. Once you are deemed eligible to compete, you will have access to the Tournament Realm, where you and your teammates will have the ability to create whatever class, talent, and gear combinations you see fit, to practice taking down all who oppose you! If you think you have what it takes, sign up here (https://battlefy.com/world-of-warcraft-arena-world-championship), and check out the table below for the cutoff times for each of the Fall Season Cups.<br />
<br />
Remember, the top three point-earners of the year from North America and Europe will earn a spot at the Arena World Championship Global Finals at BlizzCon, where they will fight on the biggest WoW esports stage of the year for their share of the $280,000 prize pool.<br />
<br />
If you’re coming back to World of Warcraft for Battle for Azeroth and want to see how the pros handle the new PvP talent system, join us! The Top 8 from each Cup in North America and Europe will be broadcast live on Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/warcraft). Watch as the greatest heroes from across North America and Europe adapt to the changes—it might give you some tips and tricks for your own Arena adventures!<br />

Unless Blizzard are lying and it will be Saurfang’s, they just don’t want it to be too obvious.<br />
<br />
I hope it’s somewhere in the middle. Aggressive and savage, but tempered with restraint (So no burning down trees on a whim). But not so much so that they can’t do anything unless ‘honor’ okays it.<br />
<br />
Knowing Blizzard though I’m expecting it to end up in Baines hands. If so we’re fucked and the Horde is in the toilet like never before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a good thing tho. It doesn't force you to grind heroics for something else than gear because it gains almost no AP. :-) It's way better than the 24/7 MoS grind at the beginning of Legion. Plus you don't really need the higher AP levels. Yes, you get +iL and minor traits, but it's nowhere near the difference as with progressing your artifact in legion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Surely the writers are bringing more depth than this. &quot;Revenge&quot; is a gross oversimplification. Retaliation for unprovoked aggression and subsequent destruction of an entire capital city of an allied race falls closer to &quot;mandate&quot; than &quot;choice&quot;. <br />
<br />
Are they saying that in order to &quot;build a better world&quot; they should shrug at the Night Elves and say &quot;good one Horde, you're all done killing us now right?&quot;.<br />

Peace requires an effort from both factions, assuming there are two factions when the dust settles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could argue that its not the individual line troops/citizens/all player characters that want war. I bet if real the average joe and jane and dick and zappiboi and peon would just like to be left alone....wake up eat breakfast...go to work...come home bounce the kids on the knee....put them to bed....have &quot;fun&quot; with the wife....go to bed. <br />

Rather than this war RAWR!!!! That's caused by its leaders. There's only a war because the leaders say go poke your spear in the other side.....</div></div><hr />

If no, then those levels are still way too high. By the time someone who is not actively farming everthing he can is at 27, he's probably wearing heroic raid gear and will never see/use those traits before replacing it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Puddlejumper</div><div class="date">2018-08-19, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Surely the writers are bringing more depth than this. &quot;Revenge&quot; is a gross oversimplification. Retaliation for unprovoked aggression and subsequent destruction of an entire capital city of an allied race falls closer to &quot;mandate&quot; than &quot;choice&quot;. <br />
<br />
Are they saying that in order to &quot;build a better world&quot; they should shrug at the Night Elves and say &quot;good one Horde, you're all done killing us now right?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Peace requires an effort from both factions, assuming there are two factions when the dust settles.<br />
<br />
Sure, peace requires effort from both factions, but if both factions expect the overtures to come from the other side, then we'll all be waiting forever. Retaliation only makes sense if you have some expectation that the other side will eventually stop escalating (either from an unwillingness or from an inability to do so).<br />
<br />
There's a problem when it comes to making moral judgments about game characters' motives for war here: we *know* the Horde can't be beaten, because it would break the game. We know the Alliance can never make permanent peace with them. So retaliation is forced on us, from a plot perspective, and it can't come from an expectation of being able to win. That leaves us with one possible choice: escalation until something breaks, and breaks hard.<br />
<br />
Once you realize that the endless nature of the game forces the plot to be stupid, it becomes very easy to ignore it. Sylvanas' attack didn't hurt the Alliance: nobody actually died, and nobody actually cares about Teldrassil, and even if they did, they can just go back in time to when it was still around, so it literally cost nobody anything. Same thing for Lordaeron. Sylvanas was just perpetuating the conflict so the game could move forward into the next expansion, and any justification beyond that is specious, because if it wasn't her, it would have been something else equally boring and irrelevant. We should all be thanking her, if only for finally getting it over with, for a few years.</div></div><hr />

Day 1 some of the blue azerite non elite WQ's were giving me anywhere between 200-220, now a lot of the same WQ's are giving me around 240-270. That can't be a coincidence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both.<br />
<br />
Remember &quot;Do it again and we will end you&quot; in MoP?<br />
<br />
Well they did it again.<br />
<br />
But Blizz will totally have the Alliance chicken out, and Saurfang will be the one to dethrone Sylvanas, because the Horde are so gosh darn cool.<br />
<br />
Can't have Alliance winning a war now, can we? That would be silly.</div></div><hr />
