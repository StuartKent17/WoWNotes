Recent Ban Wave<br />
We have recently taken action against a number of accounts for the use of third party programs. Such programs not only give their users an unfair advantage, but are a violation of the World of Warcraft Terms of Use, and go against the spirit of fair play. Due to our policies on the protection of player privacy, weâ€™re unable to discuss specifics except directly with those whose accounts have had action taken against them. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/290693-whispers-of-a-ban-wave/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/11366696657?page=3#49))<br />

Unfortunately it's been temporarily postponed. Haomarush and Dragonmaw was on the list too, and that's also been delayed. I'll let you know as soon as they're back on the schedule, sorry for the hold-up guys.

Character / Items<br />
So is it you that I need to poke to fix the Argent Charger/Ebon Hold Gryphon not being account wide? <br />
Hey, I hotfixed this. Should be live soon. Thanks for mentioning! (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/420989751018004480))<br />
BAD NEWS! Data was fixed but when pushed LIVE made a mess. T_T Have to wait for a patch &amp; new tech/DB crawl. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421085094808281088))<br />
<br />
Xmog question. Thoughts on opening up FoS for Vanilla GM PvP Gear account wide? Have the FoS on my priest, want to Xmog Pally.<br />
Up to item peeps. Doesn't seem to jive w/ their current thinking but who knows. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421510501453950976))<br />
<br />
Any chance of us ever being able to do Dragon Soul LFR higher than 85? Really nice xmog sets in there!<br />
Unlikely that it'll just be opened up as is, but future system changes may make such viable. Until then, grab some friends! (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/420979471449993216))<br />
<br />
Still xmog query, what about making tier sets complete. Like dk tier 10.25 or warrior tier 10.5?<br />
I often pester the poor item peeps about that sort of thing. I hope one day we can do a comprehensive cosmetic gear pass. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421509071385026560))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
will there be a new mount available with the achieve &quot;glorious combatant&quot;? Just got my tiger &amp; love love love it.<br />
Unfortunately, there won't be. It's going to be a little unorthodox content-wise. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421713959469580288))<br />
thank you for the reply! <br />
The idea behind them is that since they are character only, you may want to do it next season for an alt. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421718543139237888))<br />
will there be an adjustment so I can solo pve mobs easier or will I have to collect a pve set to do pve things? I assume the latter<br />
Even at ilevel 522 the PvP gear is pretty good for killing world mobs. But the new PvP gear will have a higher ilevel. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421724594479718400))<br />
<br />
I know WoD brings a new PvP zone, are we going to see any new bg maps? Not a new game type but maybe (ex) AB gameplay but new map?<br />
We're focusing our bg efforts for launch on the tools side (so we can make bgs faster) and creating Ashran. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421724431572942849))<br />
<br />
Is it in the plans to add a 500k and 1 million hk's achievement by the launch of WoD?<br />
We won't add those until we find a good way to fix the HK farming that goes on in battlegrounds like IoC. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421718304508493826))<br />

<br />
I think Dave missed the point there. The point is that DS LFR had unique colour schemes on the gear, and since we can't do DS LFR at 86 or above, we can't get those colours, leaving 1 level out of 90 where that gear is available.</div></div><hr />

The point is that DS LFR had unique colour schemes on the gear, and since we can't do DS LFR at 86 or above, we can't get those colours, leaving 1 level out of 90 where that gear is available.<br />
<br />
That was my point exactly. Call it QQ or whatever you want, but there are pieces of gear in there that I and I'm sure others would like to get, but I'm not going to leave my main toon at 85 just so I can spend a couple hours in queue for a raid that is from last xpac. I liked the idea someone had of a vendor you could trade the normal version of an item for the lfr version. That would be nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could see that. I'm not a huge fan of my mains gear from DS but the colors from LFR were better than the Normal/Heroic versions for quite a few sets. Having to exp lock a toon to farm that gear at level 85 feels unnecessary.</div></div><hr />

Any chance of us ever being able to do Dragon Soul LFR higher than 85? Really nice xmog sets in there!<br />
Unlikely that it'll just be opened up as is, but future system changes may make such viable. Until then, grab some friends! (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/420979471449993216))<br />

I hope its not either. Unless there hint is &quot;remember this crappy human hair?&quot; <br />
<br />
Now, I know you can be fooled by resolution or pixelation, but if you take the gnome or undead hair at similar pixelation, it looks much better, or you know, like hair.<br />

<br />
The problem is getting into DS LFR, which has unique armor/weapon recolors (blue magma weapons for example, which are my favorite of the recolors). The only way to get them now is to queue up for LFR at level 85, which doesn't work most of the time anyways because not enough people queue up to start an instance.</div></div><hr />

I hope they don't. Those of us who didn't do Wintergrasp during Wrath would be at a severe disadvantage otherwise. Unless they make another BG where you can get hundreds of HKs while standing on a wall or in a tower :/</div></div><hr />
