Buddy cop film with him and Vol'jin, make it happen.<br />
<br />
But seriously, considering Varian wasn't the most present this expac, it's pretty cool that he at least somewhat got the final word concerning the conflict. Seems like the Alliance is probably stronger than the Horde at this point and it was Varian's way of noting such. He was basically showing the Horde the way a king is supposed to act - willing to garner peace and acceptance, but he will not hesitate to use his might, much different than Garrosh. It's certainly insult to injury for the Horde, even if it's positive for them that they didn't get wiped out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard said, &quot;Who says it's going to be Vol'Jin?&quot; Essentially, that was the confirmation for me. They tried to deflect it, but did a very poor job doing so. <br />
<br />
I'm extremely saddened by the lack of quality story telling and originality. There hasn't been any lately, and the game is clearly suffering as a result. This is the second expansion in a row in which the end boss was anticlimactic. Deathwing was a joke, now Garrosh is the same. <br />
<br />
I'm more disappointed in the Alliance side of things though. They just walked away, letting the Horde rebuild and do what they want with only a threat to hold them back.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Anyways, I'm glad Green Jesus won't be back as Warchief. Maybe as leader of the Orcs, which could still make me sad. Seriously they need to write him out of the game somehow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe Varian understands the whole lesson of &quot;Why do we fight&quot;<br />
<br />
Mantid need the Pandaren, Pandaren need the Mantid. It was explained in Valley of the Four Winds and in Dread Wastes. Mantid attack Pandaren, weak Mantid are culled, weak Pandaren are culled, the strong survive for another day.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alliance needs the Horde. Horde needs the Alliance.<br />
<br />
Alliance and Horde clash, the weak perish and the strong survive and thrive, for that one day when its &quot;OH HOLY FUCKING SHIT THE BURNING LEGION IS BACK&quot;.</div></div><hr />

WoW doesnt have demon hunter classes, tinker classes, beastmaster. but illidan, gnome leader, and rexxar exist and thats what they are. vol'jin is a witch dictor and shadow hunter not a shaman.</div></div><hr />

No one in the horde had a voice when Garrosh was selected as Warchief. Vol'Jin objected to it and trusted Thrall. Plus he deserves it, he was the only one who kept the Horde together and had the guts to go against Garrosh.</div></div><hr />

Vol'Jin objected to it and trusted Thrall. Plus he deserves it, he was the only one who kept the Horde together and had the guts to go against Garrosh.<br />
<br />
Of course Vol'jin deserved to be Warchief. And Thrall is the one who named Garrosh Warchief and now selected Vol'jin. Each faction has a leader - Goblins have Gallywix, the Forsaken have Sylvanas, Trolls have Vol'jin, Tauren have Baine, Blood Elves have Lor'themar, so who will be the Orc leader?<br />
<br />

<br />
A lot of people are saying Thrall is going to be, but I want someone else as a leader of the orcs.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I think it should be someone else too.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thyrial</div><div class="date">2013-09-12, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So who is going to lead the Orc faction now? Or do they not have a voice in the new Horde? And I love that Sylvanas head nod.<br />
<br />
My guess would be Thrall since Blizz tends to have a good grasp in terms of cinematography and in the main shot of the Horde, Thrall was the Orc present. While that may change, it certainly seems to be their current plan and the one that makes the most sense as Thrall still feels like he has to take responsibility for appointing Garrosh. It's also the best choice they have in my opinion as Thrall is the Orc with the most connections to the Alliance and I guarantee the next expansion is going to require a LOT of cooperation between the two even if it's not the Burning Legion yet.</div></div><hr />

CONTEXT PEOPLE, YOU NEED CONTEXT before you drop a quote that is almost TWO years old. Come on :S<br />
<br />
When they said that the warchief was not who we expected, was during CATACLYSM, they revealed the new Expansion MoP, and a few days later revealed that Garrosh would be teh final boss. When players started saying that it was practically guaranteed that Thrall would regain his old position of Warchief, THAT is when they said it wouldn't be who we expected.<br />
<br />
Because back then, absolutely everyone expected it to be Thrall. Then they spent the next 2 years building up Vol'jin to be warchief, but still keeping other people in the spotlight to make it a little more ambiguous (hence Lor'themar's awesome display in MoP)</div></div><hr />

&gt; Thrall should have strapped on the Doomplate, or given it to someone else to wear. It would have made a pretty bold statement. Thankfully they let him keep and use the Doomhammer.<br />

&gt; The nuances and expressions, things that go unsaid.<br />
-- Jaina's bitterness, and when Varian summons his guardsmen she has a look of approbation... likely, in that moment, she's thinking &quot;ahh, good, he is going to end the Horde.&quot;<br />

She would be by far the most interesting choice to lead the Orcs. This might sound strange, but listen. She was loyal to Garrosh and fought for him in the Siege. This should make it certain that Vol'jin will keep her in Orgrimmar either as a prisoner initially or just to make sure she doesn't do anything bad. But Zaela is what keeps the Dragonmaw Orcs under the Horde banner, and Vol'jin simply cannot afford to remove Zaela if he doesn't want to lose the Dragonmaw. Furthermore, Zaela would also be an acceptable choice for most other Orcs because she is a fierce, strong warrior.<br />
<br />
And having Zaela as leader of the Orcs also creates plenty of potential for future tensions, conflicts between her and Vol'jin. And that by itself should be reason enough to make her Orc leader. <br />
And on a side note, it would add another female leader to the bunch.</div></div><hr />

It's only fitting for Garrosh to be put on trial. It's only natural for Go'el to not want them to take him away in chains and keep him in a cage, that was what started the horde in the first place. Orc slaves of alliance. And obviously this peace won't last long, since it appears that Sylvanas has other ideas. Whether they come into action or not, will be seen in the future.

I don't think that's the reason why it will change, the peace won't last because after the cinematic you can talk with Varian and he tell you that they have to find a way to take out the plague to retake Gilneas and contain Sylvanas..., that WILL create a new conflict between the horde and the alliance</div></div><hr />

Unless Blizzard phases Garosh---&gt;Vol'jin as you progress. For example, does the Horde questline in Stonetalon Mountains involving Garosh still exist after this? I know we've had this before with Outland/Northrend etc. But those were self contained on another continent. This is going to involve the main Horde capital city and a prominent quest hub/characters<br />
<br />
Garrosh is the one who sends Horde characters to MoP to wipe out the Alliance Forthrallsake. You can't have Vol'jin do that</div></div><hr />

I wanted him to take over after Thrall departed in Cataclysm, not the brain-dead Garrosh. Vol'jin represents what the Horde was about under the leadership of Thrall and should return it to its roots.<br />
<br />
I'm also incredibly happy to see the Alliance becoming more badass. Though I now main Horde, I've always had a respect for the Alliance and it always kind of irked me that they played second-banana for so long. I love Jaina seeking to destroy the Horde immediately, and I love that &quot;we will end you&quot; line from Varian. Definitely makes me feel like the next expansion or so will have that awesome tension but not full out war between the two that we felt during BC and Wrath and then hopefully another major explosion between the two after a few more expansions.<br />

I wanted him to take over after Thrall departed in Cataclysm, not the brain-dead Garrosh. Vol'jin represents what the Horde was about under the leadership of Thrall and should return it to its roots.<br />
<br />
I'm also incredibly happy to see the Alliance becoming more badass. Though I now main Horde, I've always had a respect for the Alliance and it always kind of irked me that they played second-banana for so long. I love Jaina seeking to destroy the Horde immediately, and I love that &quot;we will end you&quot; line from Varian. Definitely makes me feel like the next expansion or so will have that awesome tension but not full out war between the two that we felt during BC and Wrath and then hopefully another major explosion between the two after a few more expansions.<br />

Because they were terrible. Thrall acting completely out of character (suddenly he's judge, jury, and executioner, all so the Pandaren can come in and act all Thrall like).

Thrall had full right to act like that after what Garrosh have done, Garrosh killed Cairne(with help from the grimtotem tho), nearly destroyed the Horde, Thrall new during cata what big mistake he did by making Garrosh warchief, and wast any wrong Taran zu either, he also have full right to act like he did, sounds more like you are a alliance fanboy.<br />

Thrall would and should have been the one wanting to put Garrosh on trial for his crimes if the writers (and I'm using that word so very wrongly) weren't instead trying to force the Pandaren to sound enlightened. Doubly so now that he's found balance in his soul after the events of Cataclysm. Instead, he's a thug-headed executioner acting -- and here's the important phrase, so pay attention and feel free to pull out your dictionary if you need to -- completely out of character.<br />

Mantid need the Pandaren, Pandaren need the Mantid. It was explained in Valley of the Four Winds and in Dread Wastes. Mantid attack Pandaren, weak Mantid are culled, weak Pandaren are culled, the strong survive for another day.<br />

The Siege of Durnholde<br />
The next morning, Thrall's army surrounded the keep. As planned, Thrall attempted to parlay but when Blackmoore appeared on the parapet to speak with him it was immediately clear that he was sloshed to the gills, having drunk himself into a near-stupor. Thrall told Blackmoore that he wished for the rest of the imprisoned orcs to be freed and that he hoped bloodshed would not be necessary. He went on to say that they only wanted freedom and that they would leave the Alliance alone after they had it. But Blackmoore wasn't listening. Alternating between amusement, anger and grief (he honestly could not understand how Thrall could be so ungrateful after he had &quot;given him everything&quot;), Blackmoore began screaming his plans to everyone in earshot - his intent to use Thrall to take over the Alliance and become lord of all humans. When told once more to negotiate or die, Blackmoore answered Thrall by throwing the severed head of his dear friend, Taretha Foxton, from the castle wall to land at his feet.<br />
Blackmoore may have intended to break Thrall's spirit with this gesture, but much like when Orgrim Doomhammer killed Anduin Lothar to discourage the human forces, it had the complete opposite effect. It was too much for Thrall to take, and along with his profound grief at Taretha's fate came an elemental fury. The time for talk was over. He ordered his forces to attack and used the shamanistic magic he had learned against the defenders as well. Blackmoore retreated into the fortress, but Thrall tracked him down, engaging him in single combat. At first, Thrall allowed Blackmoore a fighting chance - the fight seemed to revitalize him, and he was able to hold his own against the raging Warchief. Blackmoore tried to explain, tried to convince Thrall to aid him, but Thrall filled with rage at remembering what Blackmoore had done to Taretha. Throwing his full strength into his attack, Thrall disarmed Blackmoore and forced him against a wall. Blackmoore attempted to make the best of it by drawing a dagger from his boot and slicing it across Thrall's face, narrowly missing his right eye. The Warchief sliced his massive sword down into the body of the master of Durnholde, forcing him to the ground. However, before life left the dying Blackmoore, he managed to say &quot;You are... what I made you... I am so proud...&quot; It is one of the great ironies of history that Blackmoore - intending to raise the orcs as an army to dominate the Alliance - had in fact paved the way for the restoration and revitalization of the Horde by raising Thrall.<br />
After Durnholde's surrender, Thrall allowed the survivors and their families to go free. Calling upon the Spirit of the Earth, Thrall leveled Durnholde and buried Aedelas Blackmoore beneath the rubble of his own fortress.</div></div><hr />

Not suprised by Go'el bringing the hammer down to end Garrosh. Because after all the stuff he did, to both the Horde and Alliance, he couldn't let Varian take the deathblow or take him away in chains (Death because Garrosh was/is the Horde's responsability, especially given that he personally made him Warchief. And against imprisonment because, despite it all, he remembers being contained at Durnholde), but relents in visual level of relief as Varian 1. Opts for the choice of Justice 2. Lets the Pandaren take him away. All letting him save face and not have to personally kill Garrosh.<br />
Varian was a voice of power and reason. A noble king. Nice and visual salt in he Horde's wounded pride. And with all the Orc business these last two expacs makes me remember that they are just aliens who rampaged throught the portals (etc etc), and that for all their efforts and patience, the smallest infraction will draw the full weight of the Alliance down upon the still weakened Horde.<br />
Its not a matter of goodies vs baddies for Varian anymore. He has to teach Anduin the way to rule a people. And striking down an ally, even a temporary one, at the precipic eto a new future, is not the way the KING rolls, else he is as bad as Garrosh.<br />
<br />
Also, the quote from Blizz about the next Warchief being unexpected came almost two years ago... it would have been unexpected then, but at least they didn't play &quot;pin the tail on Warchief&quot; here and I would have expected the fanbase to be less- wait... no I don't. HAHA<br />

VERY VERY good expansion, by far the best released so far. Pandaren worked out a LOT better than anyone ever expected, simply because they humbled each faction a lot specially with the threat of Garrosh.<br />
<br />
As for the lore incoming, we shall see how Vol Jin speaks in the future and if he stays as the leader he was since warcraft 3 up to this moment. Certainly glad that Thrall isnt Warchief. It would had been nice to have heard a little argument on the Alliance one between Jaina and Anduin so that the player can see how much has she changed from the way she used to be, while Anduin more than ever, wishes for a world without any war and races united. A little bit like the demon and angel in Varian's shoulders, but by no mean i am calling her evil, just a way to put it. Varian really shined by having the last word :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
CONTEXT PEOPLE, YOU NEED CONTEXT before you drop a quote that is almost TWO years old. Come on :S<br />
<br />
When they said that the warchief was not who we expected, was during CATACLYSM, they revealed the new Expansion MoP, and a few days later revealed that Garrosh would be teh final boss. When players started saying that it was practically guaranteed that Thrall would regain his old position of Warchief, THAT is when they said it wouldn't be who we expected.<br />
<br />
Because back then, absolutely everyone expected it to be Thrall. Then they spent the next 2 years building up Vol'jin to be warchief, but still keeping other people in the spotlight to make it a little more ambiguous (hence Lor'themar's awesome display in MoP)<br />

Well, some Alliance people complained for a long time that they didn't have a human hero/king equivalent to Thrall... unfortunately rather than have somebody with an established backstory worthy of leading like Turalyon show up, or giving it to somebody who has earned the right to lead the hard way (Tirion), they just copied and pasted Thrall's history and put a cherry (amnesia) on top and called it Varian. The fact his head has never fit his body (model) has always bugged me, what bugged me more though was that in those years Varian was hidden away on Alcaz isle, Metzen had so many options, and so many ways to show a contrast between factions or leadership style. But instead he just took the lazy option and churned out a pretty, long-haired human face, stuck it on a fat human body, oh and the evidence of that whole pit-fighting history? A scar on his face. Not a missing hand or an eyepatch or a bald spot where he took a glancing shot from a mace/sword. A glamour scar.<br />
I still hold out hope that Turalyon comes back through the portal one day and sets everything right.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard had a chance to elicit &quot;red wedding&quot; from game of thrones reaction in this cinematic.

At least King Chin is a Man and not so much a woman like every one of the horde leader now a day<br />
