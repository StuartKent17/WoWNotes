Warlords of Draenor - Nagrand Zone Preview<br />
Today we are taking a look at Nagrand, which has seen significant updates since the original preview. Keep in mind that parts of the zone are clearly not finished.<br />

MMO-Champion Forums Moderator Recruitment<br />
Good news everyone! We're recruiting moderators for the forums again! The amount of users and posts keeps increasing and we reached the point where we need some help before the trolls take over and play Whack-a-Mod in the Darkmoon Faire. I know it sounds fun, but I'm going to assume we don't want that. <br />
<br />
Please be sure to read the entire post before applying!<br />

Combined Revive Pet and Mend Pet<br />
We actually had a similar idea: merging Revive Pet and Mend Pet. If your pet is alive and active, you'll cast Mend. If they're dead, you'll cast Revive instead. I don't believe that made it into the current Alpha build.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Actually, looks like it did, but in an incomplete state. Next build should clean it up a bit. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13086799205?page=1#2))<br />

Achievements<br />
Possible for A Tribute to Dedicated Insanity come back? Kind of like how Herald of the titans stayed? It was fun going back.<br />
Changes made to raid structure in Cataclysm broke the way we used to track ToC attempts, unfortunately; that's why it was removed. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/473891667754237955))<br />
<br />
It would make more sense to have them under Dungeons and Raids -&gt; Legacy if anything.<br />
It's a new category for deprecated achievements. It has other stuff in it too, like &quot;Loot 100 Stone Keeper Shards&quot; (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/474419265810862080))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
in regards to minor stats, is it random among end-game raid gear? ie. variance on BiS with the minor stat bonuses?<br />
Yes, it'll be on end-game raid gear. Some gear that drops will randomly have a minor stat. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474324444433764353))<br />
<br />
how will the new minor stats appear on PvP gear? Particular those purchased through CQP. Is hate to buy/sell cycle to get stats.<br />
We don't plan on doing any random loot for conquest points. Possible that rolls from RBGs would have extra stats or gem slots. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/474250694225305600))<br />
<br />
Readiness stat that works like the new Echo of the Elements (% chance to not invoke a CD on rotational abilities). Viable?<br />
Not really. That'd be a huge wrench thrown in the gears of every spec's rotation, and is even less valuable than Readiness. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474459334122799104))<br />
Does that imply that the new EotE is troublesome at the moment?<br />
No, not at all. It just wouldn't work as a stat for most rotations. Works fine as a Shaman Talent. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474464568509333504))<br />
<br />
How about readiness increasing both the cooldown recovery rate AND the potency of the cooldown?<br />
We explored that, and many similar options. Problem there is that that further complicates it, then necessitates... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474464345015853056))<br />
...adding a DR on top of that. And, still has problems with talents doubling or even tripling its value. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474464392914796544))<br />

how does multistrike interact with paladin seals? with readiness gone does that mean seraphim is going to get reworked or gone?<br />
Seal damage can Multistrike. Seraphim remains as is, except swap &quot;Readiness&quot; for &quot;Versatility&quot;. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474317865516929024))<br />
<br />
How will Multustrike work with chain jump ? u can have 1 CH (4jump + 8 multistrike proc) 2 per each jump?<br />
Each hit can multistrike, doing an additional hit of damage to just that target. (ie, it affects each target individually) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474329476998774785))<br />
<br />
Can appropriate MS strikes proc mastery (CS/TV/HoW)?Can mastery proc MS?Can appropriate MS strikes proc seals (CS/TV/Judge/Auto)<br />
Multistrikes cannot proc anything, unless specifically called out as such. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474436775637573632))<br />
<br />
Does Leech trigger from any heals you perform on yourself?I assume no because it doesn't fit the name, but it's worth asking.<br />
Despite it being a little weird for the name, Leech does work on self-heals (except for Leech itself, of course. No infinite loops) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474332677210779648))<br />

PvP<br />
my biggest problem with Pvp is the rudeness of other players, especially of my own faction. Much too serious.<br />

<br />
will gladiator stance warriors be subject to the additional damage in Warlords PvP despite being DPS?<br />
we'll see how it plays out but since they lose some of their tankiness, it's likely they wouldn't take extra damage. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/474023629747798016))<br />

Is FrostFire ridge going to be horde only, or can an alliance toon quest there? Wondering if I need to boost a horde char<br />
Frostfire is a Horde-only leveling zone; Shadowmoon is Alliance-only. Everyone will have some endgame content in both. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/474650248996855808))<br />

Fire-Watcher's Oath Hotfix<br />
After the Censer of Eternal Agony (http://www.wowdb.com/items/102467-censer-of-eternal-agony) hotfix yesterday (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4071-Old-Raid-Finder-and-Scenarios-SMV-Open-Next-Build-New-Model-Faces-Blue-Posts), the Fire-Watcher's Oath (http://www.wowdb.com/items/102463-fire-watchers-oath) has been hotfixed to have a 10 minute cooldown, cost 100 Timeless Coins, and work while mounted. Improvements in battlegrounds may happen in the future (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/476842177826271232).<br />

With fix of Oath it takes 1-2 hours to get mount. I got 2k coins achievement yesterday by farming level 2 and 5 alts at graveyard.

I don't think they will as it should be the result of Gul'Dan destroying Outland while opening the Dark Portal. If I followed these things, he will not do it in Warlords so no &quot;explosion&quot; =&gt; no floating islands :) But I can be mistaken.</div></div><hr />

2 alts, spamming resurrection macro on both of them and spamming Blizzard on mage. On average its 2 kills every 2.5-3 seconds resulting in 4-5 coins per minute. Also I already had about 200 coins. With 4.5 coins per minute that's 6:40 to get 1800 bloody coins. Well... it might have been that long, after a while felt like it was faster.</div></div><hr />

How is this possible? Where did you do this? Did you bring low level alts to Timeless Isle? And how did you go past the increasing CD on ress with each death? After a few deaths, the CD for corpse running is 2 minutes. <br />
<br />
Explain in detail how you did it please, and where, because I really want to farm for this mount now...got 3 accounts so I can also do the kill 2 alts thing.<br />
<br />
The more I try, the less possible your claims seem...censer = you can kill your own faction and ress, but then the toon gets the CD for 10 minutes (I tried). The Fire-Watcher's oath enables to kill the OTHER faction over and over with no CD, but then you can't ress without getting the 2 minute resurrection CD after a while. I can't wrap my head around how you managed to do it the way you claim so please post tactics and how you went about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bullshit, you might speak for YOURSELF, but not for me and flying doesn't stump my exploration and appreciation of gorgeous view AT ALL. It enables MORE exploration and MORE views from different angles. Duh. There's a reason why humans have been dreaming about flying since we first took notice of birds.<br />
People blaming flying for less immersion are about as clever as the people blaming flying for world PVP dying out. Immersion = PERSONAL, and as such there are people getting it from flying as there are people getting it from being just grounded. Why the hell should one group have to give in when the other is free to choose already? Especially with leveling to max level being grounded and zones being made with ground leveling in mind. <br />
<br />
Once I have explored a zone on the ground, I wanna get the additional exploration and views that flying provides. Otherwise I feel stumped.</div></div><hr />

I was using Fire-Watcher's Oath, not Censer. Differences from censer:<br />
- Oath can be used anywhere in the world, Censer can be used only on TI.<br />
- Oath does not give debuff to player that prevents collecting coins, Censer gives 10 minutes debuff.<br />
- Oath does not require target to give honor. It means you can kill level 1 character, you can kill character with &quot;honorless target&quot; debuff.<br />
- Oath has 10% chance to give coin on killing blow, Censer has 100% chance.<br />
- Oath does not allow you to kill players of your own faction, so if you are alliance you need to kill horde.<br />
<br />
Getting past CD on ress is easy - use spirit healer. Players below level 10 do not get resurrection sickness and their armor doesn't break. Not that it matters because Oath ignores ress sickness anyway. To make it faster you can (and should or your arm won't handle all the ressing) use macro to release spirit and resurrect at spirit healer.<br />
<br />
I was using it on graveyard in Thousand Needles. My horde alt was parked in Tanaris for quick access to neutral AH, graveyard in Thousand Needles was closest one without guards. Flew second alt there from tauren starting area on 2 man mount using high level horde alt. You can probably find graveyard close to starting area and farm there.<br />

I know they can't be there on an intact Draenor, but this Nagrand really does look like any other grassy and foresty place.<br />
<br />
floating mountains in the air? its draenor not outland...jee...that would be stupit...</div></div><hr />

I think they did it to fix another exploit. I've checked certain inappropriate website, people there wrote tutorials on how to create multiple trial accounts and completely automate farming using software intended for multiboxers. As usual exploiters ruin it for all of us.</div></div><hr />

Also that boat looks like an Ogre Juggernaut http://www.wowwiki.com/Juggernaught<br />
<br />
It is a Juggernaut, just not an ogre one. Also, it seems that they were never affiliated, directly, with the Ogres, just like the Destroyers weren't directly affiliated with the Trolls either (retcon/clarification of course).</div></div><hr />
