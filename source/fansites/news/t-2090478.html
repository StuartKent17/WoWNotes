Blizzcon 2018 i'd assume, maybe earlier<br />

No, the next expansion will for sure be announced at Blizzcon 2017, but likely wont be released until late 2018.<br />

Yep their aim with Legion is to try and pace content like FF14 does in a quick manner but still polished. So I'm assuming they are going with the xpac every 2 year model now. Can refund it any time between now and the event.</div></div><hr />

IIRC they did that at Blizzcon 2010 with Cataclysm. It was even before launch and they talked about upcoming features and raids/dungeons.</div></div><hr />

EDIT: i meant blizzcon 2017 for my other post, 2018 for the release<br />

I see. Makes more sense now.</div></div><hr />

If we get 7.1 in November then its going to be until at least May if not June before the next raid and I dont think it would be a good idea to wait until then. Hoping 7.3 is the 2nd tier.</div></div><hr />

D3 expansion and no legacy servers. Or Diablo 2 remastered. Once they say no Legacy servers it will be funny to watch people scream &quot;BUT YOU PWOMISED&quot; :)</div></div><hr />

Yea I can't imagine this schedule is anything but bad news for diablo fans. One hour of mainstage time? Almost certainly no major announcement coming for it unless they trick us somehow.<br />

- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
They are not going to put diablo 4 in the list. They could easily announce it during the opening ceremony and talk about it during the 20th anniversary party, he'll its on main stage, then that would make sense that diablo 3 would be day 2 so we know to expect while we wait</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW will have some 7.2 insights (maybe a short teaser like Karazhan?)<br />
<br />
Hearthstone new expansion, that's for sure.<br />
<br />
Starcraft, new DLC or what's that called. Mission pack.<br />
<br />
Heroes of the Storm will showcase at least 1 new hero and maybe new maps/rules for Brawl.<br />
<br />
Overwatch, a new map and a new hero perhaps?<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldnt hold my breath until August next year, at the very, very, very earliest, if they announce it at a convention, like they did Legion. Blizzcon next year, if not.<br />

Diablo forever untouched by Blizzard<br />
<br />
D3 is getting the most time on stage, how can you say that? You have no idea what's coming, but generally when one game gets more time than the others, something big is coming.<br />
<br />
I mean, do you people complaining actually think they'd put whatever the surprise is on the schedule? Really?<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
Chaud, there's a typo on your chart - the Diablo 3 panel on the first day is 17:00 to 17:45, not 18:45 like you have, that's 15 minutes into the costume contest.</div></div><hr />

There is a lot WoW stuff, hope they will announce second raid tier. If this is Tomb of Sargeras, we can bet for Argus Palace as final raid; if not, we can bet for Tomb as final raid ;P.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's no reason these two couldn't both be the same raid.<br />
<br />
I could totally imagine a 12 boss raid where we enter the Tomb of Sargeras, fight 6 bosses on the way there, battle a big bad as boss 6, guarding the portal, and enter that to Kil'Jaedan's palace on Argus, for the second half of the raid. A bit like how Siege of Orgrimmar started in Vale before we took a portal to Orgrimmar within the raid.</div></div><hr />

It's probably just a bit of &quot;we continuing to support D3 with seasonal patches&quot;, maybe a little preview for a bigger S9 oder S10 patch, since the last few didn't add much.</div></div><hr />

To all the people complaining about eSports ruining everything - there's no less panels than every other year, The only reason it seems more sparse (not 10 different WoW panels on every single aspect of the game) is because they have 6 active games to slot in now, it's not just WoW, Starcraft and Diablo anymore.</div></div><hr />

What would a sequel bring that an expansion cannot? Diablo WILL get an expansion annoucement, there's been little content introduced in the game for months and that development time had to go somewhere.<br />
<br />
People hopped all up on the rumor mill for Diablo 4 when there was little evidence it was in development. Are we really going to believe that some dice misprints are part of an elaborate conspiracy to annouce Diablo 4?</div></div><hr />

they should just implement some cliff where characters can jump down to death (fun part), and some ladders for casuals, and stairs for elite players...to climb back up (grinding) after they have jumped dead 1000 times, they get an token and 100 000 times, wallmart coupon (reward). token makes you able to take elevator once and walmart coupon gives &quot;made in china&quot;, save-the-pacific-from-trash-mug, made from toxic plastic or flammable rubber thing what you can put under beer glass, and you see &quot;blizzard&quot; hologram there when looking through emptied class.<br />
all should be connected to twitter and facebook, of cource, and you can put your followers jump to death with mobile phone app.</div></div><hr />

It's possible, but I would like to get build up with Argus/Mac'Aree zone (Suramar style) or whole expansion for KJ Palace.</div></div><hr />

7.2 on the other hand, is going to be spoken about for sure. <br />
<br />
But nothing &quot;weird&quot; on the schedule this year that shows they're gonna reveal something cool, so I am not sure if I am gonna bother<br />
with one of those tickets this year.<br />

But we're not gonna see a new game reveal this year, that I am pretty sure of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;WoW lore is slowly but surely running out&quot;... /Facepalm, as if lore is some sort of tangible and exhaustable resource... :rolleyes:<br />
Just as how the game didn't end with us reaching level 100, it won't end over lore reasons since levels and new stories can always be added. <br />
<br />
Would also be a pretty damned retarded business decision to end a cash powerhouse (on a bad year) to make something new, untested and surely not appealing to everyone playing WoW... Many Diablo players never played anything related to Warcraft, and the other way around.</div></div><hr />

Not too early if it was a Diablo Expansion. You do know Blizzard has other games beside the only one you thought about.</div></div><hr />
