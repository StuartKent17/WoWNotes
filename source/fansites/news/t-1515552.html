Don't worry Eventbrite's ToS prevents them from selling on Ebay, even if they show up on their they can't actually be sold.</div></div><hr />

And despite all that, they raised the price this year, which is kinda laughable if you ask me. Just my 2 cents on the matter.

<br />
1) If they can barely afford to go, then perhaps they shouldn't, and maybe they should re-examine their priorities in life.<br />
<br />
2) If people &quot;happen to have some cash lying around&quot; - it doesn't mean it is just some evil guy at a computer with a stack of pizza boxes who lucked into a little spare change to scalp tickets with.<br />
<br />
3) The buyer is just as responsible, who also has the &quot;cash lying around&quot;...those people don't make you sick too? It seems simply that people with more money than you make you sick.<br />
<br />
4) Revisit #1. Execute the plan.</div></div><hr />

I know with the photo and stuff needed to be sent it would be hard. My current understanding is you buy the ticket and can resell it as you have so long to supply name/photo etc etc.<br />
<br />
They should lock the name on the ticket when you buy it and then require you to send some ID with photo to prove it was you who made the purchase. (although i guess this means no presents for people)<br />
<br />
It would maybe cut down on all those ebay tickets at stupid prices.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the badge pickup process<br />
<br />
1) stand in line<br />
2) when you get to the front of the line, they ask for a barcode which they email you that has your name on it<br />
3) they scan barcode and check your ID and compare it to the name on the barcode to make sure you're you.<br />
4) They hand you your badge(s) and your baggy(s) and send you on your way.<br />
<br />
Here's the upstairs security process<br />
1) flash badge at security guard<br />
2) walk in<br />
<br />
They don't even check your ID upstairs, they just wave you in (unless you have a bag of some kind, they search that for computers and stuff). So, if you put John Blow on 4 of the badges, and your ID checks out, you can give three of those badges to some random asshat and they get in.</div></div><hr />

If Blizzard would limit the number of tickets that can be bought in a single transaction it might help. If only 4 tickets can be bought at a time then the scalpers would have to get back in line with everyone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EU subscription should be cheaper t owow</div></div><hr />

<br />
They do limit it to 4 per purchase, additionally you can only buy 4 per billing address. <br />
<br />
A few things about Ebay scalpers... They aren't actually allowed to sell the tickets via Ebay and all ebay auctions can and should be reported. Additionally it is against the law in California to sell tickets for above the orginal cost of the tickets. Also keep in mind some of those ebay auctions are scams and don't actually have tickets.</div></div><hr />

Think of it this way. Someone had been budgeting and saving up money to go to BlizzCon for a year or two. They have enough money for the trip and the tickets and all other fees, but it's tight. They want to meet friends, have a good time, go somewhere. The tickets sell out, and the only way for them to go is to buy ridiculously inflated tickets, because some scalper assholes bought up as many as they could making it so actual fans get screwed over. This is my issue with it. I wouldn't care if they just bought four tickets and it turned out someone else wasn't gonna go, so they sold the tickets at price/very close to the actual price to make back their losses, but they don't. Instead, they charge double, triple, or anywhere inbetween, and this is outrageous to me.</div></div><hr />

The last couple times I went to Blizzcon there were people selling tickets at the convention, and if they are following state laws they cannot sell them for more than the original price.<br />

<br />
<br />
And those smart people can be reported and have their auction null in void. Because Ebay clearly states...<br />
<br />
<br />
No matter where you live or on what eBay site you're registered, listings for events that take place in regulated locations must follow the guidelines for that location.<br />
<br />
And California state law says you can't resell tickets for more than the original price.</div></div><hr />

If your not fondling kids nobody cares, 50 yr old ppl can enjoy disneyland just like they can enjoy blizzcon.<br />
<br />
And for the &quot;theres nothing new to announce why go at all?!&quot; crowd, its barely about the convention itself. It's about being able to party with other dorks from all over the world and load up your battle net account with a ton of new friends to play with over the course of the next year.</div></div><hr />

That would be a virtual ticket... the cheapest Blizzcon tickets have ever sold for is $100 but that was awhile back.</div></div><hr />

A LOT. i've had friends that had to resort to ebay and never paid more than 50.00 over retail. people can place them up for outrages prices but you can watch and get decent deals. Its really impossible to stop. Oh i can't sell my ticket?? here buy this rock for 250.00 and i'll give you a ticket for free! (we did this in college for student tickets to games .. the school couldn't do anything).</div></div><hr />

They'll camp outside the event selling their badge for 200 bucks, as per state law...<br />
<br />
and the goody bag for another 500</div></div><hr />

O.o $199 wouldn't even cover the airfare from some places in the same country.</div></div><hr />

They don't 'deserve' to go to blizzcon just because they are rich enough to pay 10k+ on a 2day trip, if they did deserve it blizzard would do what you suggest.<br />

<br />
<br />
I Dunno. Maybe because I don't get assaulted by asshats pushing their shitty Survival/Horror/MMO/Sandbox &quot;GENRE DEFINING&quot; game whenever I walk by a booth. Maybe I want to focus on Blizzard's Titles, since those are what I am most interested in right now, and not have to listen to shit about &quot;The next BIG FPS GAME&quot;.<br />
<br />
shit last Blizzcon I pretty much was glued to everything and everything WOD related. Instead of going to a booth and reading a little information, maybe I want to dive in to the panels and presentations related to WoW.<br />
<br />
Also, IIRC the only major announcement Blizzard has made at PAX was Hearthstone. Diablo 3 was at the Worldwide Invitational Paris, ROS was at Gamescom. Every WoW expansion has been announced at Blizzcon. SC2: WOL was announced at WWI Seoul while the &quot;Trilogy&quot; was announced a year later. Heroes of the Storm... well Blizzard DOTA was announced at Blizzcon '10, first demoed in the backrooms at Blizzcon '11, and publicly demoed at Blizzcon '13.<br />
<br />
And we can't forget Titan... Maybe we'll see something this year?</div></div><hr />

It has not always been $200, no idea where you're getting this BS info from lol. I remember my first Blizzcon in 08 was $100.</div></div><hr />

WRONG<br />
<br />
Tickets for the first event were US$125 each for admission to both days of activities. For the 2007 and 2008 events, prices were lowered to $100. For 2009 the price was raised to $125. For 2010, the price was raised to $150. For 2011, the price was raised to $175. For 2014, the price was raised to $199 as well as the price of the Benefit Dinner raising from $500 to $750.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is definitly getting more greedy in the last years. Not only Blizzcon. Seems they want to milk the people who are still playing to compensate for the missing millions... not nice to hardcore fans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or you know, they need to take up more space at the venue and are being charged more. Use your head.<br />
<br />
The benefit dinner is not even important.</div></div><hr />

Go look at some of the pictures of people in line for Blizzcon and that will explain it all. Seriously, it will take out all the mystery. Or watch a video of that red shirt wearing lore guy asking panel questions. Yeah, I can see him dropping $200 just to get in the door.</div></div><hr />

Actually Blizzard has stated several times that Blizzcon is a financial loss. They loose money doing Blizzcon. They don't make a dime unfortunately.</div></div><hr />
