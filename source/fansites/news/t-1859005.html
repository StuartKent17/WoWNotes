Dragoncon 2015<br />
TheCrafticus (https://twitter.com/TheCrafticus/with_replies) was at Dragoncon and talked about Legion! MMO-Central (http://www.mmo-central.com/) and Elvine (https://twitter.com/Elvinelol/with_replies) were also there and live tweeted (https://twitter.com/mmoc_events/with_replies) the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Demon Hunters are starting at Level 98 right now.<br />
Death Knights will continue to start at Level 55.<br />
Demon Hunters will have a short transform, with inner demon visuals.<br />
Only Demon Hunters will be able to use glaives. <br />
Double jump won't be disabled anywhere.<br />
Survival Hunters will get a Harpoon ability that allows them to throw a spear to pull mobs towards them.<br />
Most specs are getting overhauled, tweaking them to fit the fantasy of the spec. Some will be renamed.<br />
Some specs will use a renamed resource, such as Insanity for Shadow Priest.<br />
The sewer class hall for Rogues looks great, not really like a sewer at all. It will have treasure chests. <br />
The Moonkin model will be updated.<br />
No new major glyphs will be added.<br />
No Gnome hunters yet, maybe when it makes sense to add them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
There will be a &quot;single system&quot; to upgrade profession items. The current item will be destroyed, giving you a reagent needed for the upgrade (Obliterium). <br />
A new team will be working on professions this time, including profession quest lines.<br />
Professions will get some crafting items from dungeon loot.<br />
Professions won't have daily cooldowns.<br />
Prospecting could make a return.<br />
<br />
<br />
Transmog / Items / Stats<br />
<br />
If the new transmog system is account wide, the item must be usable by the class trying to use it.<br />
No tabard tab is currently planned, but the new transmog system should help to clear up some space.<br />
Multistrike is being removed and other secondary stats will have changes as well.<br />
Players can still only equip three profession crafted items.<br />
There won't be specific item art for each race and class, as Artifact weapon art is the priority. <br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
Dungeons will absolutely be relevant again.<br />
Illidan is ready to lead Demon Hunters against the Burning Legion.<br />
The Park in Stormwind won't be repaired yet.<br />
There are plans for Jaina. <br />
The backpack might be updated.<br />
Warlords was not a filler expansion and built some things that will be used going forward.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.2.2 Hotfixes - September 4<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
Timewalking<br />
<br />
Gundrak<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where the loot tables for Gal'darah and Eck the Ferocious got swapped while Timewalking.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
General<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where players were not transforming correctly into the opposite faction in Mercenary Mode.<br />
Players with the Mercenary Contract effect should now be able to use faction mounts while in an Arena Skirmish, Rated Arena match, or Rated Battleground.<br />
Fixed an issue where Rated Battleground faction auras were incorrectly applied while in the Arena.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where some characters were unable to complete bonus objectives.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion - Moonkin Model Update<br />
Sounds like thereâ€™s been a misunderstanding somewhere here. Our current plan is that Moonkin Form will indeed receive a high-res model update in Legion.<br />
<br />

Someone really needs to tell blizzard the old saying about polishing a turd, no wait it's a sewer so polishing a bunch of turds.<br />
<br />
No Gnome hunters yet, maybe when it makes sense to add them.<br />
So what, they expect us to wait for the gnome expansion? yep, Gnome hunters, coming 2968. Because it made sooo much sense adding in Tauren pallies during Cata, what with an expansion all about holy cows taking over Azeroth /s<br />
Any time an expansion launches, it 'makes sense' to add in new race/class combos (so long as the lore fits OR new lore is added for it, like the Sunwalkers). In the case of gnome hunters, they already exist so no new lore is even bloody needed...<br />
<br />
There won't be specific item art for each race and class, as Artifact weapon art is the priority.<br />
Wow... so we only get 1 weapon for the entire expansion and that's too much work for them to make a decent variety of armour? I'll admit some of the artifact weapons look great but... Not sure what I really expected at this point, Blizzard don't seem to give any shits. (see next point)<br />
<br />
The Park in Stormwind won't be repaired yet.<br />
lol... it's just pathetic at this point.</div></div><hr />

It would be so easy to make it like the toy tab and convert the 1 or 2 tabards that cause issues to be converted to shirts but still show outside the armor. Instead we have to vendor them all (for people like me that had well over 30) or just not collect them after we get the achievement. Also, the Warglaives are one handed swords which is why human rogues and warriors would go nuts for them in BC. I hope the idea with demon hunters starting at 98 is to have them hit 100 in the starting zone then come straight to the new zone. I would like to see a catch up system where they can double back and get the garrison just for professions if that system still exist where you can use the buildings to get easy points. I would really like to see some early information about professions since that always seems to be the last thing to get released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the problem is that something like Death Grip is extremely valuable as a raid tool and only DKs currently have it. In some areas where having a mob pull makes a huge difference in how easy something can be (for instance, in the trash pulls leading up to Kilrogg Death Grip makes the guys that run to the pools trivial while if you have NO DKs it's a lot more involved)</div></div><hr />

tbh i dont really care about either versa or ms. but having less stats to choose from kinda sucks, assuming that versa will still be a weak throughtput stat we will have what, mastery / crit / haste? with half the classes probably valuing the same stats<br />
<br />
if they keep removing stats after couple expansions we might be left with just item level :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Been discussed to death, but it means that each class tier set won't have a separate variation for each race. <br />
<br />
Similarly, they won't take each of the 36 spec specific artifact variants, and multiply it by 13 to make one for each spec/race combo.</div></div><hr />

You know who else thought they needed to really put out some new names for classes people had played for years and are emotionally attached to? Final Fantasy 14 1.0. Sadly, in their rush to become a successful game for the people playing it rather then the one the developers want, they scrapped this as one of the absolute first things dropped.<br />
<br />
But it will be really cool to learn that just like marvels avengers, we can be a hammer fighting/throwing avenger! Retrobation? What's that word even mean, there's a bunch of normal people who love avenging and hammers now so let's get them on board, they probably haven't spent a dime yet on one-time shop purchases and could give two shits about yelling at us for changing things for what anyone would transparently see as getting the most subs for the least work.</div></div><hr />

*â€¢Most specs are getting overhauled, tweaking them to fit the fantasy of the spec. Some will be renamed.<br />

IMHO It was the biggest issue with WOD certain Specs just didn't feel finished they removed various spells/Abilities and instead of a replacement they just left alone making that spec feel like something was missing.<br />
<br />
Stand out for me was Mages. Frost were pretty much okay But Arcane/Fire really felt like a work in progress.<br />
If they can get a decent rotation on destruct locks also that will help no end with the boredom factor (something again only I felt after WOD).</div></div><hr />

Hardly used based on what evidence? Personal anecdotes don't do you or anyone else any good. Also, from a development perspective, integrating twitter is a MUCH simpler task to perform than changing existing systems that need to take tabards with requirements and on-use effects into account.<br />

You're a software developer and you think that its harder to throw a 4 input UI around calling an existing twitter web service call that probably thousands of apps and websites make use of already vs adding a whole new collection system?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm...I wonder what that means? Is it a &quot;Yeah of course, being account-wide means just that! It's usable by the classes that can use the items collected like heirlooms are usable by alts that can use the type of weapon/armor that the heirloom is!&quot; or does it mean that the transmog system won't be account-wide because it would then require more work?<br />
<br />
Well, the weapon/armor type part was kind of a given because that is already in place. I think it's more so answering to fact that if it gets implemented account wide then only the designated class can transmog to the designated classes tier gear or certain cosmetic sets like the SoO Shaman gear. I was pretty sure that was already part of the system anyway (although there are only a few places to get other classes stuff like wintergrasp). They might just be stating it because they have gotten questions regarding it.</div></div><hr />

1. add tbl_tabards to the character/account info (about 2 minutes for a semi competent dba)<br />
2. duplicate the hairloom or toys tab, name it tabards (let's give this task a couple of hours assuming some left thumbed intern does it)<br />
3. make sure item ids of tabards are linked to that UI (say, half a day of coding, testing, maybe even add the &quot;where to find&quot; to the tooltips)<br />
4. connect character sheet slot of tabards to the selected item from tab made in step 2 (lets give this half a day as well for that same left thumbed intern)<br />
... there, done, minimal fuss, minimal effort, i don't think anyone asked for a some super flashy effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still keeping this inane restriction in is just bad. I get its because the devs are limited in their creativity to design a system that allows for crafting to not be in conflict with their necessities for gear drops in raids and dungeons but you'd think with a &quot;whole new team&quot; they would be able to not have this be the case.</div></div><hr />

This task would be a &quot;jump in&quot; for an intern with a one week deadline without payment. So basically Blizzard just like to make noise around themselves. Negative PR is a type of advertisement. Just look what they did with the flying... insane.<br />

AS IF they are going to let an unpaid intern screw with either the collections tabs, the database, or the character sheet?<br />
<br />
You guys should submit your resumes then. I can promise you that it is neither that easy nor that simple and most certainly not as easy as the twitter integration. That is practically a mod in terms of design and functionality and it calls a twitter API that already exists. <br />
<br />
Collections are account bound. Tabbards are not for the most part. They might not WANT to make them account bound. We've also seen multiple instances where the effect of an item precludes it from being added to the toy collection for whatever reason. <br />
<br />
You're talking about involving the UI team, systems team, database team, probably more. it has to go on a schedule and if they are already working on a transmog thing then that puts tabbards low on the list to bang out, even if they could do it in a few weeks. I'd rather have Legion out a week early than have them waste time on a tabbard collection system.</div></div><hr />

Most specs are getting overhauled, tweaking them to fit the fantasy of the spec. Some will be renamed. <br />

I don't know if this will save it but they finally realized you can't have the same old specs as your playing an actual lvl 110 character not a level 10 that's has leveled to 110!! <br />

Always wondered, how art ends being so time-consuming at Blizz, where it is probably the one thing they could successfully outsource and save time on production (as opposed to design and programming).</div></div><hr />

why would i leave my current job? i enjoy it and make good money from it (and to be honest it's much more intense/interesting then game programming/design).<br />
<br />
to be honest, the main issue here wasn't the making or not of a tabard tab, it's about how they keep sending people out to spout BS about &quot;this being hard&quot; &quot;this is time consuming&quot; &quot;this will require us to give up a raid tier&quot;. those of us who actually know what's involved in software making (and in game design/production) can spot this crap, and i for one am fed up with it. so i illustrated in the most rudimentary way possible a viable solution.</div></div><hr />

If the new transmog system is account wide, the item must be usable by the class trying to use it.<br />

Hmmm...I wonder what that means? <br />
It means that you still cannot transmog a plate item look if you're a cloth wearer, or a sword for your priest. Nor can you transmog a Paladin raid set over your DK's.</div></div><hr />
