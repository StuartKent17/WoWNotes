<meta name="description" content="Official Forum Changes 
You probably know that official forums are getting changed this week. We've got a few more updates about that. 
First, it seems that old forums will stay along with the new role-based forums (see blue post below) 
Also, the Blue Tracker was updated and now tracks these new categories. 
 
I didn't have the time to add the categories to the page yet, but you can reach them through the following links :

You probably know that official forums are getting changed (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=23956.0) this week. We've got a few more updates about that.<br />
First, it seems that old forums will stay along with the new role-based forums (see blue post below)<br />

<br />
Class forums staying along with new forums<br />
We have decided that the class forums will stay along with the new role-based forums. To be clear, the primary purpose of the class forums will be for players to present information to other players. The developers will not have a large presence there except to moderate. If you want to discuss class balance, this is the place.<br />
<br />
If you want to discuss optimal dps rotations, try and decide on a talent spec, or ask someone what gear you should be using at level 70, class forums work great for that. If you start a long thread in the class forums about how your class is the weakest on in the game or how you can't beat mages in PvP, those threads will probably get locked or deleted. Those discussions belong here where you will have to contend with other players who just might disagree (as well as the blues). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12065200512-i-hate-this-new-forum-format.html))<br />
<br />
Reasons behind the changes to forums<br />
We're still evaluating what we like and don't like about the new structure. We did think it was time to change the forums though. It was becoming clear even players didn't hold the content on them in high regard. There is definitely a benefit in having players communicate with each other, particularly on broad topics and particularly on issues of class balance. We had way, way too many (even on the beta forums) threads that turned into pity parties about who was the worst class.<br />
<br />
I don't think uninformed players of other classes will need to chime in on topics of no interest or concern to them (such as how to maximize warlock dps) any more than they do now. On the other hand, players do stand to learn something about other classes. We don't think there was anything magical about the way the forums were structured before. There are dozens of other ways you could set them up. It's the quality of the individual threads that ultimately matters.<br />
<br />
WoW is several years old and just as with the game itself, we don't want the forums to stagnate. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/12065380032-gc-the-class-forum-change-was-your-idea.html))<br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
Healer Boredom<br />
One of the things we hear a lot from disaffected healers is they felt like they were playing the UI and not the game. Healers are notorious for standing in fires or whatever because they aren't even looking at the battlefield much of the time.<br />
<br />
Here are some random thoughts on the issue:<br />
<br />
If everyone threw larger heals more rarely (and damage input matched) you could look away from the UI more often.<br />
We can't just increase healing range without also increasing the range at which the boss can hit you.<br />
Nameplates (if refined) could have a lot of potential for combining UI with the game wold more effectively.<br />
Integrating things into the base WoW UI such as out-of-range indicators, better debuff indicators, or heals from other about to land on a target might make healers be less dependent on mobs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/12065380712-healer-boredom-a-ui-issue.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking too easy in its current state<br />
I do agree that everything is easier right now at 70. But keep in mind these 3 things coming up at 80:<br />
<br />
-- Bosses have more armor. That is going to affect the threat generation, particularly of warriors and bears.<br />
-- A lot of groups are AE tanking and burning down groups. It's fun, but at higher levels the risk you're going to take is that those groups kill you.<br />
-- Threat is easy to manage now, and not too bad in Naxx. Naxx was designed to be more of an introduction to raiding. It won't stay that easy. I wouldn't expect a lot of Void Walker-style competitions to stay on top of threat meters compared to other tanks, but you might have to worry about the dps'rs catching up to you at some point. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/12197380125-i-kind-of-wish-tanking-wasnt-so-easy-now.html))<br />
<br />
DPS Balance in PvE<br />
Pure classes should be able to out dps hybrid classes by a small margin. However, hybrid classes should be able to be a lot closer than they were in BC, and depending on the skill, gear and encounter involved, will sometimes beat the pure dps classes.<br />
<br />
For purposes of this discussion, pure = mage, warlock, hunter, rogue. These are the classes that cannot spec into healing or tanking roles. I don't want to get too far down into what that margin should be, because then players return with a WWS parse saying &quot;See, the mage beat me. You said we would be competitive.&quot; <br />
<br />
I'm not saying the difference is only 1%, but even if it was, just look at how many players get freaked out about something that could increase or decrease their sustained dps by 1%. If your group doesn't notice a difference when it runs with all hybrids, then chances are you have e.g. awesome shamans and really cruddy mages. That's cool. If you can still kill the boss, you're golden. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12065190196-balancing-classes.html))<br />
<br />
Post expansion PvP balance<br />
I'm not going to promise that we will automatically buff any class that can't obtain X arena rating in the first season. That takes all of the onus off of the community and makes the assumption that strategies and tactics never evolve, which they do. But we will make balance changes for PvP purposes after LK ships. Absolutely. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12065200734-will-future-pvp-balances-come-after-lk-ships.html))<br />
<br />
The logic behind the revamp of Hybrid classes<br />
Our logic worked out like this:<br />
<br />
1) Buffs are breaking the game. There are many examples you could insert here, but here are a few:<br />
-- Ret paladins can't get into the melee group because of all the buffers in there.<br />
-- Stacking shamans for Bloodlust rotations.<br />
-- Stacking Shadow Priests so mana conservation would be irrelevant.<br />
-- Mages getting shut out of raids, in part because it was better to bring yet another lock to benefit from Curse of Shadows.<br />
2) We decided to consolidate buffs such that similar ones would not stack, but we extended the effects to raid wide.<br />
3) Thus, in a 25-player raid, you need far fewer than 25 players to get the buffs you need, allowing you to fill those remaining slots with who you want.<br />
4) Without the benefits of those buffs, those remaining slots would most likely just go to pure dps classes. Shamans, for example, might go from 5 per raid to 1 (or 1 death knight instead).<br />
5) So we buffed hybrid dps a lot.<br />
6) But we knew at the other extreme that pure dps classes risked getting shut out of raids if hybrids could do their damage.<br />
7) So we made sure the pure classes could still do superior dps given similar skill and gear. We wanted you to risk having lower dps if you brought all hybrids.<br />
<br />
We don't go into a lot of detail about how much higher or lower certain classes should be, because we noticed that players respond to this by posting WWS parses that shows their class in the #10 spot and get all bent out of shape about it (and totally ignoring the bit about equal gear or skill).<br />
<br />
The net result is that hybrid dps is much higher, but not as high as pure classes. If you are an awesome hybrid player, then you will sometimes top the damage meters depending on your gear, skill and the specific encounter. But you probably won't do it as much as a rogue, mage, warlock or hunter (again depending on their skill).<br />
<br />
I know the edge here sometimes seems fuzzy. It is. WoW's combat system is pretty complicated and hard and fast rules can only get you so far. But that is the basic model in very simple terms. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12065200684-gc--why-hybrid--pure.html))<br />

Armory Maintenance<br />
We are currently performing a maintenance on the Armory and due to this the detailed character profiles will be unavailable for the next 2 days. Thank you for your patience as we continue to make the Armory a great feature for all of our players to use. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/12065200369-armory-maintenance.html))<br />

Druid mana issues<br />
We're not trying to punish Feral with a lack of mana or anything. We're just evaluating how they perform and what they do, especially in PvP with regards to this issue. The bottom line is we're not sure yet if it's really a problem or if the Feral players are just having trouble adjusting to the change. (I understand many of them *say* it's a problem.)<br />
<br />
We also aren't trying to make Balance and Resto the shifting specs. However, as mana-using classes they are going to be able to do more with that mana, such as healing. We want druids to be able to shift -- that is a major part of the class. The only thing in contention is how often is too often and how much can they do in night elf or tauren form. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12065380653-gc-polite-feral-suggestionsyespolite.html))<br />
<br />
Lifebloom<br />
There are plenty of good threads on Lifebloom post-nerf. It is less powerful than it was before, but it is still a very good spell and we fully expect druids to still use it in PvE and PvP. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/12065150294-bring-lifebloom-back.html))<br />

Hunter Ammo<br />
We are looking at ammo too. We think there might be ways to turn it into an interesting decision about ammo type and not something that requires you to procure 500 stacks before a raid. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12065380332-hunter-ammo.html))<br />

Mage Armor<br />
FWIW, Mage Armor is quite powerful, but it's a trade-off. It's going to make mages harder to kill by some classes but easier to others. That seems like a decent design, so then it just comes down to numbers. We'll keep an eye on it, but it's not something slated for an imminent nerf.

Holy paladin potential AE healing spell<br />
Just say for sake of argument that anything remotely like Circle of Healing is off the table. Just pretend we said that it goes against the vision of the paladin class or whatever to ever AE heal (that's not true, but just roll with me here). Now then, what is the one healing spell you would want added to your repetoire? (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/12065280704-what-paladins-want.html))<br />
<br />
Retribution Paladin<br />
We LOVE Ret paladins. Seriously. We made a ton of changes to the spec that we wouldn't have done if we didn't care what happened to the class. When we did Naxx tests and people brought Ret paladins, it was great. Even before they became overpowered, there were several posts by Ret pallies saying how they liked the changes to their class (so I don't think it was just an issue that they were rolling over everyone that made them fun).<br />
<br />
Sadly, you were overpowered by a considerable margin in both PvE and PvP. That was our fault (mine really) and not anything the community did. Most Ret pallies actually seem to agree they were OP and only argue with the magnitude of the nerfs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12065150829-impressive-gc.html))<br />

Elemental AOE<br />
If you have ever read the beta forums, you'll know that we have changed our minds on the design of Elemental and decided that the spec needs to be able to do real AE in order to fill the ranged dps role. We're still considering the best way to do that. Totems, Chain Lightning, or Thunderstrom are all candidates (possibly glyphed) but all have their problems too, which is why we haven't settled on an implementation yet.<br />
<br />
We're not convinced Enhancement needs AE. Rogues and cats don't have a true AE (though they might really want one) and it doesn't seem to have hurt them much. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12065090064-shaman-aoe-viability-for-enhance-and-ele.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warlock.jpg Warlock (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=680) / Talent Calc. (9095) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warlock))<br />
Warlock concerns (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12065150471-gc-warlock-concerns.html))<br />
Soul Shard system not even touched<br />
I have said many, many times that this is something we're looking at right now. I am going to be less sympathetic to QQ that we don't read your posts if you don't read ours. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12065150471-gc-warlock-concerns.html))<br />
<br />
Damage overall is too high, arenas feel &quot;scrubfriendly&quot; and even more luck-based <br />
We think there is some truth to this. The recent resilience change was intended to help. We also expect health and mitigation to increase much faster than damage increases as players hit 80, but it is definitely a concern right now in PvP. <br />
<br />
Completely reliant on having 11 points in Demo, maybe 17 (or even more). <br />
This is not a major concern for us. As I have also posted, good talents are good. If you didn't want them, they would be bad talents. If you had so many good talents that you had a hard time deciding, I'm pretty certain the response would be that the trees are bloated.<br />
<br />
Shadowflame is a pathetic addition, it's as if they've run out of ideas and don't want to bother thinking of any good ones. We're already strong enoguh at AoE, damnit. I mean really if you want to give us dragon's breath from mages, just give us the green version and call it green dragons breath with all the same goodies of dragons breath. <br />
Shadowflame fulfills a very specific role. If you hadn't noticed, we are pushing Destro more towards fire and Affliction more towards shadow. Shadowflame is one of the few spells that crosses over because it does both types of damage (which should have obvious ramifications for a lock). <br />
<br />
Teleport spell again pathetic (Can't used while stunned) I mean really Blizzard you give us a good Defensive spell after all this time and you do it half assed. I mean we actually have to set this spell up in order to use it. Tell you what make it so that Pallys have to cast a spell first before they can bubble, make it so Rogues have to do something before they can vanish/COS, make it so Mages have to cast a spell before doing ice block or blink.<br />
We think Demonic Circle is going to end up being a big deal. It's not a trivial spell to use -- it's a thinking person's spell. It takes planning and some intuition. I suspect it is being underestimated because so few people have actually gotten to use it yet.<br />
<br />
Affliction<br />
Complex PvE rotation is impossible to accomplish in PvP; you have to do far more work than before to do the same relative DPS as in BC - the spec is more reliant on spells with cast times. <br />
We think the complex rotation is very hard to pull off in PvE too and seems to almost mandate a mod, which is a problem. We have some long-term plans to change Affliction around a little bit. <br />
<br />
Why did you add glaringly PvE-based talents and changes like Master Conjurer, Demonic Empathy, Demonic Pact, Imp. Demonic Tactics, and others when you expect this to be our PVP tree? <br />
There are no PvP trees anymore. My comment was that Demo may not have the sustained dps of the other two trees in PvE, but at least it would still be taken for PvP. We need to see if the survivability offered by the tree offsets its lower dps or not. (And before anyone responds that you would raid with 10 health if it would improve your dps, I'll remind you that your dps when dead is 0.)<br />
<br />
Chaos Bolt: Could have fixed our problems with quick, reliable burst damage, but was ultimately changed into a &quot;add this into your rotation for a few more DPS!&quot; spell. <br />
Destro's rotation was among the least interesting in the entire game. It needed major help. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warrior.jpg Warrior (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=600) / Talent Calc. (9095) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior))<br />
Arms / Fury concerns (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12065380421-gc-i-think-you-failed-on-your-warrior-goals.html))<br />
#1-- Make sure they could tank a normal 5-player dungeon <br />
Arms and Fury can tank 5-player dungeons fine. The Shield Slam change alone helped a lot here.<br />
<br />
#2-- Give them both viable PvE and PvP roles<br />
You offered almost no detail here. Both Arms and Fury are mobile in PvP and bring the MS debuff. Both of them can do great PvE damage. What's the issue? <br />
<br />
#3-- Make the Arms tree about something other than Mortal Strike <br />
Arms definitely cares about Deep Wounds and Execute now. Overpower perhaps a little less. I totally disagree they are useless in PvP. <br />
<br />
#4-- Make Battle Stance a little sexier <br />
It's definitely better than it used to be. Could we do more with it? We're not sure yet.<br />
<br />
#5-- Make sure mobilty didn't just belong to one spec <br />
Warbringer is great (despite a ton of QQ when we first implemented the talent). But Arms and Fury still have Charge, Intercept and Intervene. I am sad we couldn't make Heroic Leap work. <br />
<br />
#6-- Try and get warriors to care more about plate <br />
I think the jury is out here. The goal wasn't to prevent warriors from wearing leather. It was to make plate more attractive, which I feel like we've done. <br />
<br />
#7-- Make warriors a little less reliant on &quot;pocket healers&quot; <br />
If you don't want the healing, don't push the button. &amp;#58;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
how bout a reactive heal that cures say a curse or magic effect or what ever on the target and heals for a certain amount. can as such only be used on targets that have said debuffs and doesn't necessarily have to be instant. <br />
think it would be a great option for smaller bracket pvp (which i think real sucked as holy pally the 3 seasons i played^^) and a way out of simply spamming without actually looking at who you heal ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The spell itself ? No.<br />
<br />
Druids being mobile and having various tools such as Dire Bear Form, Entangling Roots, Feral Charge, Travel Form and the overpowered Cyclone ? <br />
Yes, that made us 'OP'. <br />
<br />
The answer has come, and it's called 'burst damage', something nearly all classes across the board received now, and Death Knights. Let not forget that various of our tools got nerfed or gotten out of reach for -any- decent healing build for PvP.<br />

Still does not justify a nerf to a spell which became our staple and defined our, let's use Blizzards 'logic' and 'terms', 'niche'. <br />
And now they nerfed it heavily again, because we should be using Flash Heals.<br />
<br />
Ironic, isn't it ?<br />
<br />
Lifebloom for Restoration Druids in PvE has been hit too hard and should be compensated in PvE. Either a silly Glyph or a Idol which can even help Blizzard extinguish it's value in PvE even more, I do not care.<br />
<br />
PS: Assuming you're 'knee jerk reaction' finds is substance in the many claims people made regarding lower bracker Arena, all I have to say is: Ariena r srsnuz buznz &amp; shld b tkn vry srz idd.* ::)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the Demonic Teleport, yes its a fantastic addition to PvPers but the problem comes down to that it is purely PvP based and does not solve our problem of being Stunlocked too much. <br />
<br />
There are much more useful things they could have done, give us a more reliable Aggro Drop, make us not so dependent on demo for PvP and destro for PvE. Affliction and Demo need a complete overhaul I feel, destro more or less just needs to clean it up.</div></div><hr />

We think Demonic Circle is going to end up being a big deal. It's not a trivial spell to use -- it's a thinking person's spell. It takes planning and some intuition. I suspect it is being underestimated because so few people have actually gotten to use it yet.<br />

<br />
Ummm since when can rogues vanish while stunned? next time people ask stupid questions make sure they do their research.</div></div><hr />

I actually agree with this. I'm running around with a 70 holy pally, shadow priest, BM hunter, feral druid and an affliction lock. I actually consider the lock to be the most graceful of the 5. Nothing wrong and a little complex, but it makes it interesting to play. For now, I wouldn't touch a thing.</div></div><hr />

Push what button ? - the inflatable healer or... ?<br />

Yes, affliction is great! But they really should have fixed all the bugs that are on the live realms atm, it's unbearable.<br />
<br />
I really, really love the new affliction tree and I hope 3.0.3 will fix all the issues because right now our DPS is just ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Affliction locks are definitely better off than they used to be, but there are a few minor things that need adjustement.<br />
<br />
Mainly what bothers me is Shadow Embrace's clunkyness in PvP. Missing out of the damage increase and -HOT debuff way too often because it's impossible to maintain or even get off 2 stacks in competitive arena on one target, let alone multiple targets.<br />
How to fix? Make Corruption and Siphon Life apply SE like they used to do.</div></div><hr />

Just say for sake of argument that anything remotely like Circle of Healing is off the table. Just pretend we said that it goes against the vision of the paladin class or whatever to ever AE heal (that's not true, but just roll with me here).<br />
<br />
Now then, what is the one healing spell you would want added to your repetoire? <br />
<br />
I think using spells that we already have is a great way to improve upon holy for paladins i.e. judgment of the pure and infusion of light. <br />
<br />
I think this should continue when trying to create a better AE heal than what can be accomplished with the glyph of Holy Light and Flash of Light.<br />
<br />
For example a talent that gave consecration an AE healing affect and dmg reduction to those who where standing in it. <br />
<br />
Of course scaled to spell power, consecration could be a great benefit as a heal more than dmg for a holy pally.<br />
<br />
Although beacon of light is a great talent i would not hesitate one second to sacrifice it for a Holy consecration.</div></div><hr />
