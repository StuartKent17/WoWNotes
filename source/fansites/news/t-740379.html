Cataclysm Beta - Build 12539<br />
A new build has been deployed on beta realms. <br />
<br />
Important - Login Fix<br />
Hi guys,<br />
<br />
We've made some changes to the login server, however these changes didn't quite stick. You will not be able to login without doing the following:<br />
<br />
1. Navigate to the following folder in your beta install.<br />
~\Data\enUS**<br />
2. Open up your realmlist.wtf file with a text editing document.<br />
3. Change the &quot;set portal public-beta&quot; line to &quot;set portal public-test&quot;<br />
4. Save this change.<br />
<br />
At this point you should be able to login normally.<br />
<br />
**This folder will differ depending on which language you installed WoW Beta with. For example if you have a German install, the folder will be deDE.<br />
<br />
If you still have issues with logging in please post here!<br />
<br />
Thanks guys and sorry for the inconvenience. <br />

The warlock changes are good. I'm glad about Dark Arts, but I'm confused with the Soul Fire changes. It now has a longer cast time than on live. 3 sec on live and 5 sec now on beta. Kinda makes Imp. Soul Fire talent kinda pointless?<br />

That's always been the case. And yes, meta locks can easily tank lots of heroic bosses and even survive for a bit against several raidbosses.<br />
<br />
The lock changes are interesting to say the least. I expect they'll modify lots of stuff still but some new additions are really nice. Jinx in particular will be cheered on by most locks and the consolidation of the pet-specific talents into one is a welcome change.<br />
Having the Infernal and Doomguard being guided by the Banes is also a good idea. This way you can steer them at least a little bit.</div></div><hr />

No. No, it has not.<br />

By the way, those 'spells' you gain when first chosing a tree at lvl10, does this apply only to the first tree you've selected? Or would it be possible, for say an Enhancement Shaman, to gain both Lava Lash and Thunderstorm?</div></div><hr />

Only the first tree you chose. So if you chose enhance at 10 you would get lava lash , dualwield etc.</div></div><hr />

I find it quite strange that the rank 2 gives more than rank 3 :P<br />
<br />
<br />
Rank 1: After taking any damage, you have a 30% chance to become Enraged, giving you a 5% damage bonus for 12 sec.<br />
<br />
Rank 2: After taking any damage, you have a 30% chance to become Enraged, giving you a 10% damage bonus for 12 sec.<br />

<br />
berserker rage: Good change imo. I play a warrior, and knowing when to stance dance to avoid that fear just brings more difference between being good and bad at dancing. Remeber the pace will change so if you eat 1 fear it's not the end of the world.<br />
<br />
Ghost wolf: It's going to be instant in some way, be it talents or baseline. Don't worry.<br />
<br />
Shadowflame fear: It better be a short fear. If not, that's just dumb :/<br />
<br />
Awesome worgen looks. Are those new skins overall, or just a new look you can choose? (are the old models still available?)<br />
<br />
I'm hoping all the trees are going to be mad in the same fashion that the fury tree is going. Bloated enough that you actually have to sacrifice some talents you could really need, if you want those other talents you really want, but not too bloated.<br />
<br />
Bloated trees are good if we're going by the new philosophy or &quot;making decisions in your specs&quot;.<br />
<br />
If people whine when they get TOO MANY good talents, they can just go diaf somewhere:) Peace out</div></div><hr />

Just like the instant ghost wolf thing for Enhancement...<br />
<br />
Blue tracker, last week, and for the past few months even they have clearly stated that they want CC to matter a lot more in Cata. Ie. less 'easy' counters to the usual CCs. This directly relates to the Beserker Rage nerf. Not 100% sure about the isntant ghost-wolf, perhaps related to the same, perhaps not...not really interested in shammies anyways :D.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Elemental<br />
Elemental Devastation is now an Enhancement talent.<br />
Ancestral Knowledge is now an Elemental talent.<br />
Improved Lava Lash is now a 2 Ranks talent (Down from 3). Increases the damage of your Lava Lash ability by 15/30%, and by an additional 10/20% for each of your applications of Searing Flames on the target, consuming those applications in the process.<br />
<br />
Enhancement<br />
Improved Shields is now a Tier 1 talent. Down from Tier 2.<br />
Ancestral Swiftness is gone.<br />
Frozen Power *New* - Increases the damage done by your Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, Lava Lash and Shock spells by 5/10% on targets afflicted by your Frostbrand Attack effect, and your Frost Shock has a 50/100% chance to root the target in ice for 5 sec. when used on targets at or further than 15 yards from you.<br />
<br />
Restoration<br />
Earth Shield is now trained at level 10. (Down from 50)<br />
<br />
Why is Improved Lava Lash posted under the Elemental tree?<br />
Frozen Power isn't new, it's in the game for a few patches already.</div></div><hr />

probably because they increased the time you spent underwater with all races, and the undead one was rather mute. Now with the buffs to stay underwater in the new zones especially Vashj'ir (check out the youtube videos) they probably deemed it useless.<br />

I think you may misunderstand what &quot;dumbing down&quot; means. They changed the breath gauge almost two years ago and Vashj'ir isn't the only place with water. It is, however, the only place a perma-buff for underwater breathing.<br />
<br />
Detect Invis got some use in Naxx for avoiding face pulls on the ghosts (w/e their names were). It got some use a while back in EPL in some places before they uncloaked the invis mobs all over the world (about the time they added phasing into the engine). I can see it having useful potential, but I won't go into why I don't see that happening...<br />
<br />
As for Ice/Fire/Shadow wards, I honestly never saw anyone use those. I had Shadow ward on my hotbar and in all the fights I could use it in, it never absorbed enough to make me consider using a GCD for it. I know tons of quality mages that have said the same (from various forums, in game and guildies I've run raided with). And Amp/Damp Magic, they would be useful if not for the negative side effects they bring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The breath thing was still changed BEFORE guess what when they redid the old zones.. that's it ! (seriously do i have to t y p e l i k e t h i s to make it easier for you)<br />
<br />
You're not the brightest so i'll explain, how many quests in TBC and Wotlk did you gain an item that gave you a buff underwater for underwater quests? almost all of them, yes... that's it.. keep with me now. So in the new zones what are the chances that you'll need unending breath - very low. Dumbing down. Making the quests easier. (you caught up yet).<br />
<br />
EVERY mage i've ever known used Fire/Ice Wards WHILE LEVELLING (psst one of the major things with cata) seriously didn't you think before you posted. You're speaking like a raiding elite jackass and that's not the point of cata at all hence the changes.<br />
<br />
They are in essence dumbing down the levelling complexity for new players making it easier for them with the new abilities and shorter talent trees to get them into the game. As research was shown by Blizz as they stated in an interview and as said by total bisuit (almost every one of his Cata videos) most new players get to level 10 or lower then quit.<br />
<br />
The majority of WoW players ARE asian and they don't even have Woltk yet ! only around 4 million are US (australia et al)/European (includes russia for some reason).<br />
<br />
Blizzard wants to remove the amount of spells and abilities that clog up (as it were) the action bars which aren't really needed. (not in TBC, Not in wrath) certainly not in the new zones.<br />
<br />
the fact i had to spell this out for you... really gives me a headache. If your seriously going to tell me blizzard aren't dumbing down, i doubt you raided before 2.0. (heh the 1.9 &quot;paladin&quot; patch, bad times)<br />
<br />
The times, they are a' changing. All those warlock spells now USELESS. :) get used to it ! =)</div></div><hr />

(seriously do i have to t y p e l i k e t h i s to make it easier for you)<br />
<br />
You're not the brightest so i'll explain, how many quests in TBC and Wotlk did you gain an item that gave you a buff underwater for underwater quests? almost all of them, yes... that's it.. keep with me now. So in the new zones what are the chances that you'll need unending breath - very low. Dumbing down. Making the quests easier. (you caught up yet).<br />
<br />
EVERY mage i've ever known used Fire/Ice Wards WHILE LEVELLING (psst one of the major things with cata) seriously didn't you think before you posted. You're speaking like a raiding elite jackass and that's not the point of cata at all hence the changes.<br />
<br />
They are in essence dumbing down the levelling complexity for new players making it easier for them with the new abilities and shorter talent trees to get them into the game. As research was shown by Blizz as they stated in an interview and as said by total bisuit (almost every one of his Cata videos) most new players get to level 10 or lower then quit.<br />
<br />
The majority of WoW players ARE asian and they don't even have Woltk yet ! only around 4 million are US (australia et al)/European (includes russia for some reason).<br />
<br />
Blizzard wants to remove the amount of spells and abilities that clog up (as it were) the action bars which aren't really needed. (not in TBC, Not in wrath) certainly not in the new zones.<br />
<br />
the fact i had to spell this out for you... really gives me a headache. If your seriously going to tell me blizzard aren't dumbing down, i doubt you raided before 2.0. (heh the 1.9 &quot;paladin&quot; patch, bad times)<br />
<br />
The times, they are a' changing. All those warlock spells now USELESS. :) get used to it ! =)<br />
Being a condescending prick only makes you look like a moron and makes your statements hollow. I was not insulting toward you in my first reply, but you seem to think I was making some sort of personal attack against your character, which thereby shows that you lack in that area. If you find this reply to be insulting, well, sometimes the truth hurts. I won't bother addressing the rest of your post since I try to make it a point to not bother much with someone that thinks they're better than everyone around them. I do know one thing, you wouldn't talk that way to someone face to face, though I have no doubt you'll claim you would. The truth of the matter is, you actually wouldn't.</div></div><hr />

I think I'm going to avoid the Holy Paladin changes until they settle down a bit though. I imagine it isn't an easy thing to take a class apart and then try and re-work it so entirely. Paladins still seem to be in flux, although I'm sure things will settle down a little in a build or two (or three). I only hope they don't over do the changes, I have a level 80 of each healer class and I focused on my Paladin because I enjoy the way they heal and I love the 'hand of &lt;insert name&gt;' spells. I don't play a Warlock (yet!) but from the sheer number of changes I'm guessing they're in the same boat. Since I don't have a beta invite I guess I'll just sit tight and wait and see, no point getting excited/depressed over changes that will most likely be rescinded in a build or two.</div></div><hr />

As has been said countless times and will be said countless more, the talent trees are not final. I know for newer gamers that aren't accustomed to MMOs and how expansions work and this being their first time experiencing this phenomena that it isn't quite understood yet, but things will change between now and the expansion going live. Part of those changes are things being moved around in talent trees.<br />
<br />
Also, as it stands now, there's plenty of points for a Warlock to be Destro or Afflic and still get Soul Link by level 80.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowtal.com/#k=vAldIIL5.9ob.warlock<br />
That build is just me putting 31 points in Afflic and then dipping into Demo for SL. I also recall a blue post saying something about making sure that SL would be available all three specs for PvP purposes.</div></div><hr />

about icy touch change. as you should know already blood presence will be the tanking presence and frost presence the dps presence. Now while in blood presence icy touch will cause a high amount of treath but when you switch to frost presence it won't make a huge amount of aggro (like icy touch in the old days).<br />

I'm only guessing, but maybe they're planning to remove the racial restriction from it like they did with Exorcism. It would make the change to it in the current build make more sense. Then again, maybe they're trying to phase it out after all. *shrug* ;p<br />

The skeletons for the models are already there. For a company with as many resources as Blizzard has, there's no reason at all they could not have updated the old models for Cataclysm while working on the new races. In fact, that would have been more efficient than waiting to put a team on that project some time down the line when more important projects should be getting attention. They have a list of things they wanna get done, but that list seems to have a very strange and very inefficient priority setup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Skeletons for the Worgens are also already there, which means that the small amount of effort to update the model for one sex of one race is still minuscule compared to updating all ten current races (both sexes). The comment I replied to complained that effort was being put into the Worgen model instead of the other races, as if putting the same amount of effort forth would have had any affect on the 20 other models that need updating. <br />
<br />
As to your comment, yes, Blizzard does have a a lot of resources. No, they don't have infinite resources. They prioritized, and decided that new models for every race were a bridge to far. Would I have made the same decision as lead developer? I don't know. I have no idea what their resource tree looks like or how many models are needed to get this expansion off the ground.</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping they do remove the racial requirement because racial requirements are almost as fail as spell school lockouts. I don't even like racial requirements on CC spells.<br />

Not really, you are taking a gamble anytime you update texture files and even more so anytime you update player's characters. I think part of the reason that hey aren't doing it is because people are so used to what the characters currently look like and changing them risks having the majority of the population not liking the changes, and that would piss a lot of people off.</div></div><hr />

In one of the old dev chats, I think they said that the number of brez's would have to be limited if a 2nd class were to get a brez. So... either a 2nd class is getting a brez to get rid of one more BTPNTC contradiction, or someone thinks having more than 1 druid brez is too much.<br />

They have already stated that the Worgen and Goblin models are not using existing skeletons. The animations will look similar to other races, yes, but they are not the same. Even if they were, that's one less reason they have to avoid updating the models alongside the new races.<br />
<br />
I wasn't claiming they have infinite resources. I'm not even sure why you jumped to that assumption. The fact remains, it takes less time and effort to update a pre-existing model than it does to build one from the ground up, yet they managed to have the time to update the Worgen meshes even though they were already leagues above the old models currently in the game. That's the issue that I have a problem with. Not saying I don't want a beautiful game. By all means, I do. But if you have the resources to update a model that is not in need of it, why not spend those resources on something that actually needs the update? It just doesn't make sense not to. Or, if not updating the old models, that time spent on the updated Worgen model could've gone to something else. There's plenty of old NPC models that are being recycled with different colors. Why not update another one of those with the resources spent on the Worgen update? Don't get me wrong, I think the Worgen model looks awesomely fierce and badass, but as I've said, the resources could've gone to something better.<br />
<br />

Blizzard has said that they don't want any 10% MOAR DMG talents floating around and sucking in all the talents you have to spend. They want you to be able to pick up some fun talents and yet don't lose any significant (or any at all) dps from it. this is because they want to get rid of boring easymode cookiecutter pve specs wich favor the highest 1% dps increase.<br />
<br />
It's not the case of &quot;I'm gonna do less dps since I have to pick up this talent&quot;, but &quot;I'm doing similar dps now, but with more gadgets/tools/fun stuff&quot;.<br />

I can easily tell from this post that you are one of those people who DEMAND everything to be SHIT EASY, and that think your awesome at your warrior since you got a lot of ArP.<br />
<br />
this is GOOD CHANGE:<br />
<br />
a) It gives more uses for stance dancing , ehich is supposed to be the CORE of warrior gameplay. (the warrior is balanced around this, don't worry)<br />
b) Allthough berserker rage didn't make you practically immune to fear, it did give you a free trinket pretty often, against this cc, which required NO PREPARATION whatsoever.<br />
c) Maybe warr dmg is going up since we lose arp gemming, best MS and easy fear break. I predict it will.<br />
d) I played warr throughout some of vanilla, and all of TBC, and berserker rage was only berserker stance then. Sure you played alot in berserker stance, but it was one of those things that made it possible to distinguish a bad from a good warr.<br />

On a purely monetary basis yes, Blizzard could get their artists and model/texture people and re-skin every model in the game. However, they also have a schedule and lists of other priorities to take care of. Like any company just having the money is only one piece of the puzzle, you have to look at other factors, like is it really worth updating? Considering that Blizzard has other content they still need to build and balance, time and resources are being directed elsewhere to more important projects. We have seen some models updated and I bet more are to come, but money alone would not bring that change.</div></div><hr />

Divine Plea. They stated previously that there would be a prot talent for refreshing the duration of Divine Plea on hit, just as it currently does. Also, they might be making Seals of the Pure add a Seal of Wisdom effect onto all of your seals, as Wisdom is removed and Seals of the Pure is being changed (Despite it not being shown on the tree).<br />
<br />
<br />
wtf, I tried to do a holy pala build and it seems you have barely no choice, just fill literally all talents to 41 T_T what is this i dont even<br />
<br />
http://www.wowtal.com/#k=1CHq7IZr.9ob.paladin Probably not the best, but it's a start. Just remember making trees at this point is somewhat pointless as they're subject to change until the end of beta. I just wish I had 2 more points to get 3/3 Rile of Law and Conviction.<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy<br />
<br />
* Light's Beacon now affects each heal you cast on the target instead of just Holy Light and Holy Shock. Now heals the beacon for 50%. (Down from 100%)<br />
* Seal of Wisdom is gone.<br />
* Seal of the Pure now seems to have a chance to restore the Paladin's mana.<br />
* Denounce - You have a 50/100% chance when any of your Holy spells get a critical effect to make your next Exorcism spell instant and cost no mana.<br />
* Tower of Radiance (NYI) *New* - Directly healing the target of your Beacon of Light has a % chance to generate Holy Power.<br />
* Speed of Light *New* - Casting Holy Shock grants 5/10/30% spell haste for your next Flash of Light, Holy Light or Divine Light, and casting Healing Hands grants you 10/20/60% movement speed for 10 sec. Also lowers the cooldown on Healing Hands by 10/20/30 sec at all times.<br />
<br />
I'm sad and glad at the same time for Beacon, since it's no longer restricted but it only heals for 50% now instead of 100%.<br />
Seal of Wisdom... What? WHY!?<br />
Seals of the Pure, at least on the tree, I didn't see anything new to that talent. Maybe they're making it so that, in addition to the current effects, it also adds a Seal of Wisdom-style mana restore component onto all of your seals. This would make me happy.<br />
Denounce... PvP talent? Seems like a waste of points for PvE, even though I know they're trying to make healers a bit more offensive.<br />
Tower of Radiance is interesting, actually gives us a reason to focus a heal on our beacon target. I'm assuming it's either going to be 33/66/100% or 10/20/30%.<br />
Speed of light is just awesome, although I'm wondering why it jumps from 5 to 10 to 30% spell haste... Possibly it's only supposed to be 5/10/15%? Or maybe 10/20/30%.<br />
<br />
Also, where's Divine Light? As far as I know, it isn't learned immediately upon choosing Holy, so could it be that Divine Light is baseline now?<br />
<br />
Lastly, I really hope that you can choose the old Worgen model. I kinda liked the old model... made them look at least like they COULD be gentle. Now they look a bit too savage for my tastes. The ones in Boub's picture look better than the other screenshot from the character screen I've seen earlier in the thread. Boub's just looks more realistic than savage. I think it's the eyes and surrounding area that I'm focusing on the most... I prefer the old ones that actually look... like they have a soul. Not that soullessness is a bad thing, I enjoyed Pengu's evil eyes before the change to cutesy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrgnDancer</div><div class="date">2010-07-21, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They have already stated that the Worgen and Goblin models are not using existing skeletons. The animations will look similar to other races, yes, but they are not the same. Even if they were, that's one less reason they have to avoid updating the models alongside the new races.<br />
<br />
<br />
Before this update to Worgen model, the Worgen skeleton was done. They already had a Worgen model, they HAD to have Worgen model, because Worgen are part of the expansion. Therefore the effort required to finesse the existing Worgen model to this one is the same as would have been required to update one skin of one race/sex. So saying that they should have spent the effort that they spent on this change to update all the models, is patently silly. Now if you're saying that they should have redone the current character models instead of designing Worgen at all, that's a different matter. Yes, the effort to build the Worgen model from scratch was probably comparable to re-skinning all the current models. That isn't what was said, the complaint was the time spend tweaking the mostly complete model vs spending that time tweaking all of the old models. <br />
<br />
<br />
I wasn't claiming they have infinite resources. I'm not even sure why you jumped to that assumption. The fact remains, it takes less time and effort to update a pre-existing model than it does to build one from the ground up, yet they managed to have the time to update the Worgen meshes even though they were already leagues above the old models currently in the game. That's the issue that I have a problem with. Not saying I don't want a beautiful game. By all means, I do. But if you have the resources to update a model that is not in need of it, why not spend those resources on something that actually needs the update?<br />
<br />
Again, you're comparing apples to oranges here. The effort to build the Worgen models from scratch was certainly extensive, but unless you're arguing that adding the race in the first place was a bad idea, then it was necessary. They had to build some model for them if they wanted them in game. The relative effort to tweak the existing model is roughly the same as tweaking any existing model... meaning 1/20th of the effort required to tweak ALL the existing models. Less really, if they tweak all the existing models they'll have to re-skin every option for hair, facial features, etc. Each race/sex combo actually has around twenty different looks that will have to be re-skinned if they mess with the old models.<br />
<br />
So why are they spending that effort on the Worgen and not on another race? Because they're working on the Worgen right now. Spending the same effort and releasing updates to one sex of one race as part of Cataclysm would just serve to piss off everyone not playing that race and sex. Better for all the old models to be equally fugly than to update say, human females and leave everyone else till later. <br />
<br />
<br />
It just doesn't make sense not to. Or, if not updating the old models, that time spent on the updated Worgen model could've gone to something else. There's plenty of old NPC models that are being recycled with different colors. Why not update another one of those with the resources spent on the Worgen update? Don't get me wrong, I think the Worgen model looks awesomely fierce and badass, but as I've said, the resources could've gone to something better.<br />
<br />
<br />
They certainly didn't hesitate to come up with a horridly fugly Garrosh model. :( Seriosuly... /wtf? lol /cry<br />
<br />
Maybe they could have spent the resources on another model, but they made a call to spend them on a model players see constantly. Worgen are a big selling point of the expansion, they're trying to milk that. You may disagree with the logic, but it's pretty undeniable :-)<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard fanboi detected. Do you realise how much money Blizzard makes and how big the company is? It's not like they have one person creating character models. And even if they did, then this one person could easily update all races in the time it took them to develop cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Do you realize that unlike 95% or more of the people commenting on this I've actually worked on projects like this? Money isn't everything. Teams can only be so large before they start stepping on each other and become so inefficient that you lose focus. Even with an infinite budget (which Blizzard doesn't have, despite what you seem to think), you have to prioritize. There's only some much you can do in specific time frame, no matter how many people you throw at the problem. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see model upgrades for all the characters. I'm not saying Blizzard shouldn't spend resources on this (now or at some point in the future), but I'm not on the design team, and I'm not going to question another developers claims that they can't resource that particular item at this particular time; not unless I know a lot more about the constraints they're working under.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What blizzard should had been doing with the talent trees in the first place was to fix the sucky talents like they are doing now instead of changing the size of the trees and removing 50% of the spells/abilities in the game.<br />
<br />
From all I can see is that now every class is equally as boring having little to none abilities (be they useful or not) in their reportoire and makes it very &quot;balanced&quot;.<br />
Removing spells from the game in the name of &quot;cleaning up&quot; surely serves the 13 year olds with their lack of brains to remember abilities with all their complexity but shows people such as me that blizzard is just wanting to make this game easier for the masses (implying it isn't dead easy yet) in the hopes of getting more permanent players. We shall see.<br />
<br />
I'm starting to think blizzard has been deliberately getting rid of the playerbase over the last 2 years with all these &quot;glitch fixes&quot; and &quot;balancing mechanics&quot;, reason for this is unknown to me however.<br />

I don't see the difference? Well other then a different face and hair style and skin color.<br />

Well this is frustrating, the side by side picture you posted looks different than the model that was posted originally; it looks good to me too.<br />
Sigh. :confused:<br />
