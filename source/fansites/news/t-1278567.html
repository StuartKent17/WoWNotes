Kind of expected this, but at the same time I am a bit disappointed. I will reserve judgement as this gameplay video starts.</div></div><hr />

Yea a tiny side project made by a dozen people on the team making a really sweet little idea for a game is clearly indicating that they're fading away.<br />

Yes, so dumb for thinking they would give us new IP when they specifically stated it had nothing to do with their previous games... Sorry but set in the &quot;universe&quot; of one of your games HAS TO DO WITH ONE OF YOUR GAMES. Fucking lying assholes. This is why I don't play their shitty fucking games anymore.</div></div><hr />

You can get the cards by just playing without paying at all. People that buy cards get them faster than people that don't. It's a business model that has been around for years.</div></div><hr />

They will most likely have Blizzard game related loot cards, and they can keep the profits of people buying up masses of packs for those as well. <br />
<br />
They could have skipped the whole process and just put the WoWTCG loot cards on the Blizzard store, but they know there would be outcry over charging £500 for a spectral tiger, so this is just a cleaner way for them to tax vanity items.<br />
<br />
For shame.</div></div><hr />

Because it's a thoroughly saturated genre that Blizzard couldn't possibly improve upon.<br />

If people were expecting more than this, then they obviously weren't paying much attention. You only have yourselves to blame.</div></div><hr />

Stop trying to pull that &quot;don't raise expectations&quot; crap. This is objectively terrible. Even the audience is hating it.<br />
Nobody wanted it? Nobody knew about it so it would be impossible to say they wanted it.<br />
And just because you don't like it, I'll bet you plenty of people still play it when they can. The audience is about 20 people lol Totally means every single person on the planet will hate it, right? &gt;_&gt; And people do raise their expectations. It's not crap lol<br />
<br />
They had all of 15 devs making it. It's not meant to be this huge thing. It's meant to just be a fun little game. But I realise people no longer pay games just for fun, do they?</div></div><hr />

To the people complaining... really? They said it was something small and with Blizzcon happening this year anything truly epic will be reserved for that.<br />

I don't think it will be terrible, and in fact I'll probably play the shit out of it. But the fact remains they still lied right to our faces.

MoP is one of the best expansions that's come out. Yeah, they fucked up on Dailies but that doesn't drag down the expansion as &quot;Brutal&quot; <br />

No they didn't lie. They never said it was a new IP. If they did then you have a point. With 'different' they obviously means a different genre. No where was it said it's a new IP. Calm the fuck down.</div></div><hr />

And it's an F2P thing that they just threw together. It's not like they diverted &quot;WoW&quot; or &quot;Starcraft&quot; resources to make it. And it seems to be LoL style microtransactions, with almost everything obtainable without 'paying' with patience.<br />

Seriously, it's probably the least 'insulting' thing they've released in years, and yet people still get mad about it....</div></div><hr />

Nowhere does it say it'll be something completely new - something different, not an expansion or sequel, or the rumored next-gen MMO.<br />
<br />
Again, did you people really expect some major announcement at Pax East with Blizzcon later this year? If they announced something related to SC, WC or WoW here they'd have less for Blizzcon.<br />

Yeah, I guess they worded it just right... When you first read it though it seems like its going to be something completely new. They said no expansions or sequels or the rumored next gen mmo... <br />
I would consider this an expansion on WoW if they include loot cards at all. Certainly seems like a sequel to the shitty real life TCG they have. <br />

Its something that could work out since there is no real free to play, widely recognized Card game out there, but on the other hand, have a card in your hands and playing against friends is a bit different feeling and i dont know if it can be quite transfused into a online game. I will give it a shot though, since i really played a lot of MTG and this game is free to play if you want to, i kind of like the decisionif i spent money on a game or have the option to earn my progress for free.</div></div><hr />

In my opinion, this shows what kind of players Blizzard has been calling to (especially in WoW) for the last years. A few years ago this would have been well welcomed among the community. I see this as a neat little game. A game I am probably never going to play personally since card games is not interesting me at all. But it's still a neat game. I guess people expect to much from Blizzard, and that everything they do is supposed to be lifechanging. Blizzard is just a game company. It's not THE BEST game company.

Would just hope that one could choose their hero instead of mages having to be Jaina and warriors having to be Garrosh, etc. Would be neat to be, say, Velen as a priest or Anduin, or Grom, Garrosh, Varian or Genn.<br />
<br />
But nevertheless, really looking forward to seeing more of this, looks neat! =D</div></div><hr />

Much better than any other team on wow. If they put half as much effort into their games as they do these cinematics we would have some epic ass games.</div></div><hr />

I personally think this game looks fun, as long as they add a better chat function, possibly custom hero portrait and such. I mean, you don't NEED to buy cards. I personally never have much time to get a group to play a TCG, and this will be a nice replacement for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
im honestly not suprised that most of the users at MMOChampion dont think much of a card game. i used to play MTG (still have about 300 bucks of cards (couple cards in the 70 dollar range. no, really. Gaea's Cradle) and it was fun.. MTG has an online game but you have to buy the virtual cards. i dont like that concept. so, instead, this is F2P. <br />
<br />
im going to reserve judgement, but on the surface it looks kind of interesting. however, tbh, blizzard said they were releasing something new, not a sequel or anyhting tied to there existing franchises. this is warcraft derived... so therefore they aren't done announcing yet, or they flat out lied.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, not sure why people expected something big as the announcement sold it as a little something.<br />
<br />
This is the kind of thing I was expecting, but I think it's a good thing. Casual and mobile gaming is plagued with tons and tons of really bad titles from small developers, or some really good ones that simply dont the public attention they deserve. It is nice to see a big development team take a shot at it.<br />
<br />
And getting it this year is very nice. I wasn't expecting to see anything from blizz until 2015. I they can push out regular updates to hearthstone or push out other similar small-scale releases, it will give a nice steady stream of new stuff...</div></div><hr />

<br />
They sell the booster packs for &quot;about&quot; $1, or you can earn them through winning matches and earning medals on their weekly ladder rankings. You can also craft cards by disenchanting cards you don't want and using them as materials.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Annoyed because everyones is complaining that its not Titan or Blizard All stars - The announcement and following blue posts specifically said it wasn't going to be either of those. This pretty much exactly fills the criteria they talked about - its something different - check, its a smaller scope of project - check its a new game - check. <br />
<br />
As for announcement itself, I think it'll be a fun game, its F2P so its not gonna cost much (not sure if you'll still need to pay upfront? or if it will be totally free? I've always kinda been interested in the whole TCG thing, but not really had any friends who are into it, and I lack the free time to go find a club where I could get involved, this seems the perfect way to get involved! On the bonus side you just know that future Collectors Edition games will be giving out bonus rare cards for this game too!<br />

Actually MOP seemed decent, and turned out to be really bad. For me at least... I quit playing WoW.<br />

I was so waiting for this day, hoping to hear Blizzard All-Stars, but instead, we get a card game, which in my opinion is supposed to be played with CARDS.<br />

It's funny people who use the &quot;this is kiddy&quot; or &quot;Childish&quot; arguments are same the people most insecure with their own maturity. They mentioned a little something.

That's exactly the problem. Earning it will take quite some time, so people who don't have enough time will have to buy it. I'm sure there will be enough incentives (e.g. rare WoW ingame pets) to get people to buy those packs by the dozen. Just like the real life TCG.</div></div><hr />

Pro - Looks fun to play.<br />

<br />
Awww poor them. It's Blizzards fault now that they dont have time to play? Bad Blizzard how dare you.<br />
<br />
Obviously they aren't going to develop and release a product that can't gain any sort of profit, nobody is that stupid. The game is free though, if you have time or not you never have to spend a penny I dont see the problem.</div></div><hr />

If this proves to be successful, I could see new opportunities for them to go into other genres and widen their views in regards to their franchises, even the ones that have been one ice since the 90s.<br />
<br />
While Hearthstone is not a &quot;heck yeah!&quot; moment like their other games have been when being announced, I do see it as a positive thing.<br />
<br />
Wow there, we do not accept mature comments on these forums :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
On a serious note, I was thinking the same team. It looks like they want to keep that small dev team to make a bunch of smaller games like that, which could turn out really well in the long run.</div></div><hr />

Link a F2P game that doesn't have a micro transaction system.</div></div><hr />

It's not really stupid for developers to publish to platforms that are going to earn them more money, since they're going to be counting on people buying packs to make money from this.<br />

Probably because no-one develops (or takes forever, during which time the excitement and care level just dies) good apps for Android, because they're all jizzing on iPads. If I load up the Google Play store right now and look at games, I see a $20 Final Fantasy effort GTA and Angry Birds. The rest of it is literally shovelware or apps that don't even work properly and are ripoffs of other games (at least 9000 Minecraft clones).<br />
<br />
At this rate I'll probably have to buy an iPad just to get some good on-the-go gaming. Baldur's Gate STILL isn't out for Android.</div></div><hr />

I've got an idea...those who aren't blindly hating this/blizzard/the world and saying things like &quot;bli$$ard&quot; let's just leave the thread. Let these angry nerds have their rage fest at something so completely minute that doesn't actually effect them and let's go have actual good conversations while they're seeing red. GOGOGOGO<br />
<br />
You haven't been paying much attention to Magic: The Gathering then. The Pro Tour for that was huge in the 00's. The game is still rather big now, with huge tournaments being held ALL the time. With Pro Tours and Grand Prix still happening every year. There are shops around me that have them literally 7 days a week.</div></div><hr />

No shit, really? And what exactly has that got to do with people paying for apps?</div></div><hr />

This caters to an extremely minisqule population so i doubt this abit. Fun for the few who likes it tho :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whidbey</div><div class="date">2013-03-22, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">TCG's are about facing someone across the table, figuring out their strategy, watching for tells, and actually having real cards you can show off for bragging rights. <br />
It's watching your opponent's face as you win one of their cards, or seeing them as the mumble cuss words( if they mumble them) as you blow their hand off the field.<br />
<br />
This is a total miss. Next will be integrating it as the combat system for WoW ala wizard101.</div></div><hr />

Elucidate us. All F2P would be Freemium if that were the case so it comes down to semantics</div></div><hr />

I don't think thats a problem as long as it's not pay to win. <br />
you cannot expect a company to release a game without some way of making money from it. <br />
A game like TF2 shows it is possible to have a F2P game that allows you to buy stuff without destroying the balance, if Blizzard does it like TF2 I think Heartstone will be quite popular. especially the iPad version is a great idea.</div></div><hr />
