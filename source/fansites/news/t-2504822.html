Overcrowded Realm Update – August 21<br />
Since our last update, we have continued to see the community create new characters in preparation for the launch of WoW® Classic next week. During this process, we have seen a regular trend where characters keep being made on Full realms. Each of the Full realms has a LOT of characters to the extent that it may be more than can fit into the queue system. As a result, you may not be able to get into the queue when you want to play and even if you do, it will likely be a very long wait. For a better play experience, we highly recommend that players avoid creating characters on any realm marked as Full.<br />
<br />
Additionally, at this time, based on their expected population and queues, we strongly advise people to move off the following realms:<br />
<br />
<br />
NA<br />
<br />
Herod – PvP<br />
Faerlina – PvP<br />
Whitemane – PvP<br />
<br />
EU<br />
<br />
Shazzrah – PvP<br />
Golemagg – PvP<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are currently planning to play on one of these realms, you should expect extremely long queue times that take several hours to get through. In order to have a better play experience, we urge players on these realms to consider moving to the Blaumeux (Pacific Time Zone) and Skeram (Eastern Time Zone) realms.<br />
<br />
All of the existing realms have a healthy population. Even a Full realm in 2006 would be Low by our current metrics. Any realm that is listed above Medium should expect queues at launch, with increasing severity from High to Full.<br />
<br />

This screams incompetency to me.

Yeah, when the server is listed as &quot;Full&quot; and people keep creating characters there, it is the company behind and not the players who show incompetence. Be signing up to a realm that is already full, you are signing up to queues. English isn't really THAT hard.</div></div><hr />

While they most certainly have easily scalable servers in production at this point, it's an interesting though. One that with Blizzard's track record, I'm not sure if they would be smart enough to actually do versus actually being concerned they need to keep opening more servers.

It's not really incompetent at all, that's just how it is. They're not going to allow more people on to a server with the result of it essentially awfully lagging and then crashing, thus ruining the experience for more people than have to queue. It's obvious there was always going to be queues with the launch, there always is. It's honestly not that surprising. It's also completely competent of them to start the number of servers off small and add when necessary, otherwise the end option would be a bunch of empty servers in a few weeks/months time with the possible outcome of merging servers. It's going to die down anyway, so even now I think adding 4 more PvP servers will be overkill.</div></div><hr />

If you create characters on full realms.. or on realms you knew was gonna be streamer realms.. then You show incompetency. But basiclly at this point all the &quot;First realms&quot; are full now, so i guess we all are incompetant by that logic.. Tho i don't wish to re-make my characters on a different realm, I'll see on launch how long the que for my EU PvE realm is, and if it's hrs then i'll create on another server</div></div><hr />

I'm sad Bigglesworth is a Pacific server, I totally would have made some characters on there if it had been eastern. I also had a nice chuckle at a server being named after Old Blanchy. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
the fact that people still makes toons on full realms shows that 99,9% of playersbase doesnt care about layering - just want to play damn game on alive server. <br />
<br />
so just use maximum servers capacities instead listening to masochists.<br />

dont think so .<br />

its more about people knowing that any realms besides initial ones will be low/dead in 2 months. <br />

so they wont risk having to pay 100 + euro to transfer all toons in future</div></div><hr />

Shame it's going to be one of the servers that end up dead. 4 new servers days before release likely means they'll all end up low when the hype dies down.</div></div><hr />

Look at the outcry for people wanting server merges to escape dead realms, how it falls on deaf ears, and remember we’ve been burned before by Blizz and dead realms. <br />

Why would anyone risk that for classic when Herod and the other full servers offer better long term security?</div></div><hr />

With the name / character reservation limit being increased at the same time they won't have to worry about first deleting their toon and losing their name by the time they get on the new server.<br />
<br />
(for example I had 3 names on Herod, dropped 2 and created 2 names on another server 1 of which was the same as the name of the toon still on Herod)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There were 3 of you who responded to me but apparently didn't get what I'm saying so I'll clear it up.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying &quot;Just let everyone flood the servers on day one no queue&quot; (which I thought layering was supposed to help with but apparently I overestimated the capabilities of the layering tech) I'm saying they should have put a hard cap on character creation on these realms. For example; if the server can only handle 1,000 people on it at once, cap the ability to create characters on that realm to 5,000 unique accounts. As it stands right now, literally everyone can create a character on any one realm, it just means extremely long queue times. It does not mean they can't create characters on that realm, which again, they should have had a hard cap in place temporarily. <br />
<br />
If the game were live and active, I'd say no to my whole argument, but it isn't even out yet.

I don't get this fallacy that we'll end up with a majority of dead realms.<br />
<br />
1. It totally totally underestimates how many people actually want to play classic, a great many of whom will singularly play classic.<br />
2. It also ignores the fact that layering exists specifically to counter this problem and that since medium pop today is more than a full realm was back in 2004, that even a low pop realm after the tourists depart is probably still going to have a healthy number of players equivalent or similar to how it was back in the day.</div></div><hr />

We are going to make thing initially worse and end up with the abortion we've had for going on 10 to 15 years. That is what I am reading from these blue posts. <br />
<br />
This is going to come across to some as bit whiny, but really it just shows the level of incompetence this company still has in trying not to create these abortion scenarios and doing so anyway. <br />
<br />
I think I am going to wait, playing Classic is not that high on my list of current things I want to get done or accomplish. I am not going back to sitting in a queue to play content I have been through more than a couple dozen times before. I picked a low normal realm that is now full, even with opening one additional normal realm (EST), It too will be high or full within minutes. <br />
<br />
I was wanting to play Classic because I did not play the game back then, but queues are not something I am remotely interested in. I had enough of them for years on the realm I initially started to play the game on. This not new content, this old content that at this point in the process should not have a queue at all given the tech the company now has to prevent such occurrences from taking place.</div></div><hr />

Yep, 30 days in, they will all be much lower. From what I'm seeing, the Normal realms will probably be the first to die.</div></div><hr />

Seems unlikely given their history but perhaps after a few months when populations have settled and tourists have largely departed perhaps Blizzard will allow a one-time transfer from depopulated realms to ones that are more populated.<br />
<br />
I'm well aware that even writing this down opens me up to a bunch of trolling but this would be the right way to fix it and we, as players, should be loud about it. It's just the one time after the initial rush. It's the right thing to do.<br />
<br />
FYI: I'm perfectly aware that this is exactly backward to how Blizzard has handled this in the past but I believe this is a special case and should be treated as such.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Queue times &quot;upwards of several hours&quot; aren't acceptable. They should have put hard caps on character creation until after the hype of release dies out.<br />

For #1, I'm sure you know more than the folks at Blizzard who can see the total number of accounts and have been handling the emails, letters and forum posts about &quot;classic&quot; for a decade. Not to mention the studies they've done prepping for classic, as well as the data they've gotten from taking down private servers over the years.<br />
<br />
For #2, I'm sure you know more than the network architects at Blizzard, who likely make 6 figure salaries doing this line of work. They're not adding queues for no reason. There is a hard cap on the number of players a server can support, regardless of sharding or layering or any other contrived term you want to put in there.</div></div><hr />

Never underestimate the incompetence that exists at the corporate level! If you've ever worked at a big company you know what I'm talking about. It exists at all levels and there is nowhere near the level of execution and forethought you would imagine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying &quot;Just let everyone flood the servers on day one no queue&quot; (which I thought layering was supposed to help with but apparently I overestimated the capabilities of the layering tech) I'm saying they should have put a hard cap on character creation on these realms. For example; if the server can only handle 1,000 people on it at once, cap the ability to create characters on that realm to 5,000 unique accounts. As it stands right now, literally everyone can create a character on any one realm, it just means extremely long queue times. It does not mean they can't create characters on that realm, which again, they should have had a hard cap in place temporarily. <br />
<br />
If the game were live and active, I'd say no to my whole argument, but it isn't even out yet. There is absolutely nothing to lose by going, &quot;Faerlina has reached a capacity that we feel exceeds the capacity of what our tech can handle and therefore we aren't allowing more character creation on it at this time. Instead of playing on this realm at launch, here are several other options that are the same type, just without the tech limitations.&quot;<br />
<br />
That’s not totally fair though, really. They should have allowed one character per realm, because people have obviously just dumped 3 characters on one realm and thus it probably seems more populated that it is. Of course, they could just be going by accounts on the realm rather than the amount of characters thinking about it.</div></div><hr />

I thought I told you, several times more than you have. Maybe that was hard to understand?<br />

I actively seek it, and I actively avoid ganking. That said though, with BfA it's fully possible to beat people level 80 while you're level 60 - that isn't ganking.</div></div><hr />
