There wasn't anything to fix, 10s CD reduction to stun isn't game breaking, and it isn't like there are many prot paladins doing PvP these days anyhow with our active mitigation requiring melee target to use.. GOD FORBID we can stun someone more often than our Ret counter parts..</div></div><hr />

That depends. If the tooltip said 5s, and it was meant to be 5s all along, then correcting the behavior to match the tooltip and intent is clearly a fix.</div></div><hr />

So glad that blizzard is taking steps to deal with the like, ten prot paladins at high mmr and not wasting their time dealing with stuff that's actually OP or UP.</div></div><hr />

It's not about what I think, it's about the actual numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IF it wasnt being hotfixed so fast the numbers would soon represent the problem. Being proactive is a Good thing!</div></div><hr />
