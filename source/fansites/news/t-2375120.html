Unless the DI can randomly become druids (what would be rather weird) Alliance would still be locked behind 2 races on that class.<br />
No Zandalari pally is comparable to that i guess.</div></div><hr />

Ah, you see, the Darkiron have slightly darker skin, glowing red eyes, molten hair with different hairstyles and a different set of racials.<br />
<br />

No. They're just reskins, you won't notice any difference when you put some armor on. But hey, now you can craft blacksmith items 1 second quicker, but who the hell uses blacksmithing anyway?<br />

No Zandalari pally is comparable to that i guess.<br />
<br />
You mean how Horde is behind two races on both priest (Orc, HM Tauren) and Mage (2x Tauren)?<br />
I know Alliance is 1 behind on warlock but I personally think Zandalari shouldn't be locks. Lore wise the only demon related people they have were more akin to DH's and we know they won't get those.</div></div><hr />

Yes. I was on the fence about making such a character, but now, I will probably have a badass female with a red mohawk, probably a fury warrior. And I would love to name her Vasquez if it's available on my server. :3</div></div><hr />

It's official, Dark Iron dwarves are now the best race in the game beyond any shadow of a doubt. Also, this is the first time I've laughed out loud at any of the racial /sillies ever, this is solid gold!</div></div><hr />

WTF BLIZZARD IS WRONG WITH YOU ?<br />
<br />
story and lorewise DI paladins make more sense than VE DKs, as they have existed ingame since vanilla<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
My toughts on the racials<br />
<br />
Dungeon Delver - movement speed increase in dungeons (and raids)<br />
Fireblood - chance to deal fire dmg on attack/spellcast (swapable with forged in fire)<br />
Forged in Flames - increased fire resistance<br />
Mass Production - reduced crafting time<br />
Mole Machine - 2nd hearthstone or TP to closest flight master (2nd one would be stronger in my opinion)</div></div><hr />

It's really hard to tell in the screenshots, but their beards (and hair) are indeed on fire in several customization options, just like Void Elves and the void.

Are you serious? Player dwarves are part of the Bronzebeard Clan... it's been that way since Classic WoW. There are three major clans, Bronzebeard, Wildhammer and Dark Iron.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I read this in the wow chronicle tome 1, but I never rolled a dwarf or got interested in their story before, except for the dark iron a lil bit<br />
<br />
But I mean, horde gets Zandalari who are living in the new islands of the expansion and alliance recruits some old enemies that we've been killin for 10 years, no sense<br />

Without diminishing returns,it could go very far too<br />

On a boss like Imonar mythic,a DI dwarf could just pick up all mines in the last phase,remove the 15-20 bleed debuffs,meaning they cleared all the space with no drawbacks,while getting a massive damage increase</div></div><hr />

You're either have literally know understanding of ANY of the lore in this game or are one masterful troll. You claim it makes no sense for the Dark Iron to be with the alliance because they're &quot;old enemies&quot; but you don't seem to understand that the Dark Iron dwarf's Queen is literally part of the Council of the Three Hammers that is literally part of the Alliance now. The Dark Iron becoming playable is just a formality at this point and soon I'm sure they'll do the same with the Wildhammer. Also going back to the old enemies comment, you clearly don't get that the Zandalari trolls absolutely hate the Dark Spear Trolls which are the tribe that is currently affiliated with the Horde, so just because they're old enemies doesn't mean anything. The quest chains will explain why.<br />
<br />
Most likely the quest chain for the Dark Iron will be helping Queen-Regent Moira deal with the Dark Iron civil war that has been going on since the death of Emperor Dagran Thaurissan (her late husband). There are still a ton of Dark Irons who don't like the fact that she allied with the Bronzebeard and Wildhammer dwarfs. Honestly it makes MORE sense for the Dark Iron to become playable than the Zandalari. As Horde we're going to have to do something pretty damn major in order to get the Zandalari to play nice with the Dark Spear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Dark Irons were the race I was looking most forward to. The females look fine but the male beard and hair styles are just plain ugly. I am cool with them adding some thin beads but the hair styles on original dwarfs are just miles better. Only one hair style and one beard style are somewhat tolerable but far from good. I hope this is just early model thing or that they will add more styles. Even if it was just recolor of the original ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a race that have been almost exterminated by its own kin long ago and we still fighting them in the WoW story<br />
<br />
Plus, all the current dwarves players are not affiliated with any clan, so why it would be dark iron dwarves players ? Shadowforge City will be a new capital city ? ...<br />
<br />
Player characters have always been Bronzebeard Dwarves and the Dark Iron have been living in Ironforge since Cataclysm. Their leader(Moira Thaurissan) is a member of the Council of Three Hammers and leader of the PC dwarves(along with Muradin Bronzebeard and Falstad Wildhammer) and has been for seven real life years now.</div></div><hr />

The only problem is that they start at 60 and thats a huge advantage against the rest of the classes in order to gain the heritage armor. This won't be a problem after few months, when the people already achieved it.</div></div><hr />

She has nothing to do with dark iron, captured and had a child with an enemy faction leader just because of the lack of trust from her father<br />
<br />
She is no dark iron, dark iron have nothing to do with her and they should remain in their fire mountains<br />
<br />
<br />
And with Zaldalari joining Horde, Ji Firepaws Pandarens have 0 reasons to stay in Horde because Zandalari are their ancient allies...<br />
<br />
You mean enemies right</div></div><hr />

She was married to Emperor Dagan Thaurissan and is the Empress of the Dark Iron. For a while she lead the Dark Iron to actually capture and control Ironforge, albeit by political maneuvering(she was never denounced by Magni so she was still the heir to Ironforge when he was turned to stone). Her son is the heir to both kingdoms.<br />

I can't tell if you honestly have no grasp on the Dwarven lore and are arguing just to argue or if you're being intentionally obtuse because you don't like it.</div></div><hr />

Oh yes, I did. But it only happened in Legion that gnomes were able to become hunters.<br />
&quot;Every race can be warrior&quot; has been consistent throughout the entire lifetime of WoW (since vanilla).</div></div><hr />

They aren't changing old content for the Allied Races. I definitely felt awkward questing my Void Elf through Draenor Shadowmoon, where the entire quest series is about the victory of the Light over the evil Void. And I'm like... guys I'm RIGHT HERE. lol they don't care.</div></div><hr />
