<br />
Terrace of Endless Spring<br />
Hidden high in the mountains, the Terrace of Endless Spring is the sacred center of the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Its peaceful fountains are said to have the power to heal and rejuvenate, but when the Sha of Fear attacked, many of the complex's guardians turned on each other in fits of terror.<br />
<br />

She gains 1% casting speed for each 1 percent health of her total health lost.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png&quot; title=&quot;Tank&quot; /&gt; Spray (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123121) - Lei Shi casts Spray instead of using melee attacks. Spray causes water to burst from the ground at a player's feet, inflicting 104,000-218,400 Frost damage to all players within 2.5 yards and increasing their Frost damage taken by 10% for 15 sec.<br />
Hide (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123244) - Lei Shi hides from players. Players cannot target her while hiding, but area of effect attacks and spells can still hit her. Lei Shi reveals herself after the players strike her enough times.<br />
Get Away! (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123461) - Lei Shi channels the waters of the Endless Spring, pushing players away and inflicting 60,000 periodic Frost damage. Players who fight the current take half damage. Lei Shi channels for 30 sec or until players inflict 5% of her maximum health in damage.<br />
Protect (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123250) - Lei surrounds herself with an inpenetrable bubble and animates several elementals to protect her. She maintains the bubble until players defeat one of her Animated Protectors.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png&quot; title=&quot;Tank&quot; /&gt; Animated Protector - When Lei Shi casts Protect, she animates these elementals from the bracers scattered throughout the area. The elementals turn back into water and fall to the ground when the effect ends.<br />
<br />

In addition, players and enemies near an afflicted player take 5% more damage from all sources. This effect stacks.<br />

Wild Pet Trading Removed<br />
Keep in mind that you can still level a pet and then sell it, as long as it wasn't caught from the wild. <br />
We just finished a pass making all pets that are caught via pet battles in the world non-tradeable. This means these pets cannot be put in cages for trading or posting on the AH. We felt that the option to buy these pets on the AH would take away from the exploration/collection gameplay of the system.<br />
<br />
This could always change in a future patch, but this is how it will go out with MoP. You should see the change in our next build.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beta Class Balance Analysis<br />
Since everyone is thinking it, I'll ask...what should we read into the fact that you, and not GC, is now responding to posts in this forum?<br />
That I’m not as busy as others are right now (which is a terrible understatement).<br />
<br />
Back in the Black Wing Decent and Bastion of Twilight myself and a few friends of mine discovered that dots already on the target don't actually get re-evaluated when their caster receives a large haste boosts such as heroism and time-warp. This forces you to reapply your dots so that their period of ticking is shortened by the haste gain.<br />
<br />
As you can probably tell this is quite a hassle. Especially as an Aff lock with mucho spell haste procs. Is this still the case?<br />
Yes. The parameters of a DoT are determined at cast time. This may be a good time to explain one related topic though: Refreshing DoTs and whether that recalculates their parameters. For several classes, we have various mechanics that allow you to refresh or extend an existing DoT. In some of these cases, doing so recalculates their parameters; in other cases, it does not. Why the inconsistency, you ask? The rule we follow is that if the mechanic allows you to perpetually extend one DoT forever, it needs to recalculate. If it isn’t intended to let you maintain one DoT forever, it doesn’t need to recalculate. For example, the Demonology warlock's spell Touch of Chaos extends Corruption significantly, and it’s quite likely you’ll roll one corruption the whole fight, so it then recalculates. Alternatively, there’s a new mechanic coming for Affliction where Haunt adds 1 tick to each of your DoTs when it hits; that does not recalculate damage.<br />
<br />
GC, just a quick clarification. The new Armor Damage Reduction formula used for 86+ characters: Armor / (Armor + 4,037.5 * Level - 31,7117.5) Does this continue on to level 93, similarly how the current Cata formula worked to 88 until this expansion? or is there another formula for level 91 and beyond?<br />
It continues on to level 93. Just to clarify to make sure there are no misunderstandings, adding denotation for which variables are of the target and which are of the attacker: DamageReduction = TargetArmor / (TargetArmor + 4037.5*AttackerLevel – 317117.5).<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk))<br />
Currently Rushing Jade Wind is causing 6sec shuffle for each target it hits. (given the cap on shuffle is 12sec, it basically means you get 12 sec shuffle if you cast on more than 1 mob).<br />
This is something we're keeping an eye on for balance problems but for now, this is intended. There is a chance we may change it in the future.<br />
<br />
Still on lvl 90 talents for monks, whats the intent on Xuen tiger?<br />
Xuen does indeed cause Eminence for Mistweavers and is purely DPS for Windwalkers. For Brewmasters, he has a provoke, not a taunt. Provokes are what we normally give pets and they work like taunts but don’t work on most bosses. For example, Army of the Dead ghouls have a provoke. He should be decent at tanking and scales with your stats, the hope being he is useful as an off-tank. However, he won't be able to tank a raid boss (since he has a provoke, not a taunt), but he should be able to tank some adds and dungeon mobs. Please try that out and let us know how he does.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin))<br />
Is it intended for Judgment to no longer apply/refresh Censure anymore? If so why was that change made?<br />
Yes, Judgement has had quite the long history and has been a relatively unique ability since its inception. It's been a mix between a ‘ranged’ type attack or a ‘spell’, or for most of the past few years it’s been a ‘melee’ attack with a long range. That’s why it triggered Censure. But it also shared a bunch of properties with spells. So, for Mists, we decided to finally make it consistent with everything else and just say that it’s purely a spell, just as much as Exorcism or Holy Shock are spells.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman))<br />
Is it intended for Healing Tide Totem to act as healing done by the shaman, or as a separate entity to avoid being split by Ascendance(Resto) as its currently not being duplicated and divided.<br />
Intended. Totems' actions don't count as the shaman's. This is consistent with Searing Bolt not triggering Echo of the Elements and other similar effects.<br />
<br />
Pets are currently not taking bonus health from Ancestral Vigor from what I can see. They're receiving the buff but not gaining any maximum health.<br />
We plan to fix this in a future build. Currently, pet scaling from your own health is overwriting buffs. We plan to fix this. (This would also affect Glyph of Water Elemental, by the way).<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock))<br />
Windwalk Totem currently does not prevent warlocks from becoming snared via KJ Cunning. Is this intended or bugged?<br />
Fixed in the next build.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, there’s a new mechanic coming for Affliction where Haunt adds 1 tick to each of your DoTs when it hits; that does not recalculate damage.<br />
I wanted to post a correction on this part. Our design process is very iterative and we’re constantly trying out new things. The above mentioned mechanic for Haunt extending DoTs is something we’ve been trying internally, but have decided not to go with for now, so don’t expect to see it in a future build.<br />

Upcoming Pet Battle Changes<br />
Many changes have been ongoing with the quests. Our next build should have significant updates.<br />
<br />
A few highlights on what we have been working on:<br />
<br />
Unique Tamer emotes Unique Tamer pets Tamer battles have been tuned up in difficulty One Grand Master Tamer per continent. Defeating him/her will unlock all the daily's on that continent. The flow has been consolidated to work though our two main trainers in Stormwind and Orgrimmar. We have implemented more than 40 Tamer fights across the entire game. This does not include the boss fights! Daily quests on Grand Master Tamers offer the Sack of Pet Supplies as a reward. A new achievement reward for defeating all the Tamers. A &quot;Tamer&quot; title. All of the quests to fight Tamers are now account-wide. This means that the one-shot quests can only be completed by one character on your account. The daily's can be completed by any character, once per day. Account wide quests are denoted in the quest log.<br />

<br />
Warbot Fuel<br />
There will be a way to get Warbot fuel in MoP. Still figuring out the specifics, but we are going to make it happen. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/230454-warbot-fuel/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6079752424?page=1#13))<br />
<br />
Remove 'Safe Zones' from PvP Servers<br />
We feel it is rather necessary that the starter areas remain uncontested territory, as it gives newcomers a better chance to get a feel for the game and learn how it works... people need a chance to tie their boots before they get their faces smashed in :-) <br />
<br />
We acknowledge that the pursuit of good world PvP can make the line between griefing and PvP quite blurry, and that is very much a part of the game which seasoned PvP players are fairly used to. But it is not fun to be new to a game, or re-rolling a new character for that matter, if you can’t even leave the starter area because some enemy faction player is corpse-camping or ganking everyone and everything in sight.<br />
<br />
i heard you're going to try get us more involved with wpvp in mop but how will that change with the current dungeon/bg systems? wont people still just afk in sw/org in wait for their stuff to pop up?<br />
We are indeed trying to get people more involved with world-PvP in Mists of Pandaria.<br />
<br />
We are trying to provide a greater incitement for people to go back into the world by offering more content to do outside of the cities - this combined with cross realm zones means that you should come across more people(including enemy players) in the world overall. Additionally - the guards on PvP realms will be nerfed, so bashing in some skulls inside enemy towns and cities should be more feasible as well.<br />
<br />
Is there any info about how much weaker the guards on PvP realms will be, compared to the ones on PvE realms?<br />
I'm afraid I have no info available on this as of yet, but I can imagine that it will be something that may need a few adjustments over time anyway. The guards still need to matter and have some ability to protect the citizens of towns and cities, so they shouldn't be complete pushovers, but they also shouldn't be a near invincible army as they are today. <br />
<br />
The plans are to adjust the guards on PvP realms so they are less strong than those found on PvE realms, and they will also take longer to respawn than those on PvE realms. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/230392-remove-safe-zones-from-pvp-servers/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4940047914?page=4#61))<br />
<br />
Importance of Beta Testing<br />
May I field you a quick question? When Cata &amp; D3 came out the servers were heavily fluxed with players, down time and angry mobs of people in a certain nation we will not mention... my question is have the errors of the past been noted and improved on ?<br />
We have been rather overwhelmed in the past with more players than anticipated logging in upon release, but have taken note of past launch experiences indeed, and we will of course do everything we can to improve ourselves. More than anyone, we would like a smooth launch, and we want people to be happy and have fun when they log in after release. <br />
<br />
I'm just wondering if the stuff reported in the beta really gets noticed...:-/. I've been reporting bugs like a woman crazed, but I guess those bugs are not &quot;important&quot; enough for recognition since they still are left unfixed. Namely visual bugs and such.<br />
All reported bugs (that can be verified and reproduced of course), do get noticed and put on a list of things to fix. However it can take some time before they get fixed, as some bugs are more difficult to handle than others, and the less severe bugs do not have as high a priority as the really critical ones... I hope this makes sense to you.

Easy answer to that then either quit WoW altogether, or if still playing don't use the pet battle system there is always plenty of fun farming mats and doing dailies when not in a dungeon or raid.<br />

Seem they are one of those lazy types that rather than putting in some effort wants it handed to them, and that they were saying they wont be using the pet battle system at all because they can't buy wild pets off the AH made me laugh. lol :)</div></div><hr />

Oh -those- types of people, the ones that come in bawling and screaming blue murder, thinking their enjoyment is priority over everyone else, and that what they -think- is gospel? Those people I ignore.... <br />
<br />
I'm all up for people having differing opinions and fully understand that what is fun for one may not be for another, but if you can come and put your thoughts and opinions across in a constructive manner then I'll gladly listen to their points and have a civilised discussion.<br />
<br />
If they come ranting and raving like loons, then I will promptly tar them with the *Wahh I am not getting what I want so I need to scream louder to be heard* brush and move onto the next post:)<br />
<br />
I can totally understand alot of peoples views in regards to this issue, alot of people that like to do the AH thing, were hoping to get their teeth into this, and I do feel bad that the part of the game they enjoy won't get this new aspect to play with in this way.<br />
<br />
However, there is far too much moaning about content running short, and I will tell these people that if pet battles went live how it is right now, then this content would more than likely be the shortest content ever. (Seriously 5 days of not trying that hard but having fun and I had pretty much every pet out there including 310 pet achievement points worth of pet battle achievements,)</div></div><hr />

Just using the pet battle system to only farm pets to sell on the AH would be even less fun if that's all you intend to only do with it.<br />
<br />
Except, achievements and achievement points became part of the gameplay for me. Thus I must have as many as I can.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malackai</div><div class="date">2012-07-24, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm so glad they decided to do this with the pets. As a pet collector and having played Pet Battles on the beta, I pretty much got the 400 pet achievement after 5 days, don't get me wrong I was out battling all over the continents, and had a blast, but it was also too easy to just pick up the *harder to find* pets off the AH, or even certain pets that were from zones that were a little farther out the way. <br />
<br />
I never looked at pet battles as something I would make gold from, because for me it's all about the collecting, but it certainly defeats the purpose of *content* when you can just buy everything off the AH without setting foot out in the world.<br />
<br />
I never looked at pet battles as a major income either, but the chance to get some extra income besides the boring mat farming was interesting to me in a more TLPD lucky type of way but that aspect is now completely gone it has become a solo/self thing. <br />
<br />
And in this case the funny part with this change is that now after those 5 days (or give it 2 weeks if your taking it slow ) most diehard players will be likely completely done with their list and don't have any incentive to go back out and look for rare pets. So some months in to the game most zones will be desolated anyway and the others can pick up easy rares anyway.<br />
<br />
Normally to keep things healthy and alive you need some competitively between players. <br />
It just requires some tuning in most cases. For example make the more rare pet spawns more rare and make the rare quality pets less frequent. In that case you don't have the AH overflowing with them.<br />
Or more simple put a restriction on the payers that want to buy them there so many options and most of them are not even hard to implement. But seems they rather stick with some half assed band aid solution instead.<br />
<br />
but right now this change is going to make the repeatability value shorter. Which is pretty much the opposite of what blizzard was trying to attempt. it also even worse since pets and even the pet battles are being shared between characters on the same server. <br />
<br />
Wow is starting to look more and more like some small spoon fed gating game log in for an hour get your little list done log back out and if you have the stomach for it log an alt and rinse and repeat previous steps.<br />
Interesting stuff being blocked with daily gating progress.<br />
pet battles starting to look more like a one time capture thing to fill out your personal list after that there's no incentive to go back out and your stuck in the daily sitting in ogri/sw queuing for random battles, dungeons, LFR.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I was looking forward to the caging process. It would have resulted in having something extra to do and spending some time outside of the raiding calendar and besides the daily mat farming and most important something you could have done for a whole expansion. now its just a thing that will get crossed of your list in the the first couple of days or weeks and then the majority of the whole system is gathering dust for the rest of the expansion. <br />
<br />
It seems nowadays people are happy to just complete the blizzards daily to do list everyday log back of again. but yet they complain they are bored and everything gets stale so fast.</div></div><hr />

Also thought of it as a potential source of revenue to help some of my toons out, but what really gets to me is that this doesn't even fix the issue blizz supposedly has with selling them which isn't even forcing people to explore from their point of view. You can still train, level and sell pets that aren't caught in the wild, and that pretty much negates their stance that buying pets allows you to circumnavigate the leveling process and fast track your way through the trainers and such. If people can still buy high level pets then how does removing the ability to trade/sell wild pets even affect those that want to skip it? You could arrange so pets of a certain level can't be used in battle until you defeat a certain trainer, you can arrange for caged pets to revert to level one, there are many better solutions than simply removing the ability to trade and sell wild pets, but trust Blizz to throw out the baby with the bathwater.</div></div><hr />

Selling something CAN be part of roleplay and I do consider the Auction house part of roleplay. My toon caging an animal obtained through petbattle was part of roleplay, judging the pet and considering what to do with it was part of roleplay. I understand why Blizzard removed the option and it doesn't hurt me that much, but it was a whole lot of fun. Does fun always have to be rational? I think not. And it would have only hurt those that actively chose to spent their gold on farming pets from the auction house - because they would have missed out on the pet battles, but that's their choice isn't it? <br />
<br />
As it stands now, it's just a something Blizzard forces on the players: either get out there and explore or miss out on achievements and I'm not sure I like that.</div></div><hr />

Really? I mean, in Pokemon, someone could theoretically just sit around in the global trade center and never touch the rest of the game if they just keep trading up. Why not just make traded pets not count towards the achievements...? Make it so that you HAVE to capture them, and maybe have a little subtext below the pet's name that says whether it was &quot;tamed&quot; or &quot;traded?&quot;</div></div><hr />

While I love a good conspiracy as much as anyone, how does this affect the Blizzard Store sales? The ability to trade (or not trade) some pets from the store is not being affected at all. This update just makes WILD PETS that you actually capture unable to be traded, and I think it's a good move.</div></div><hr />

Or from Pet vendors. Or from getting off your butt and catching them yourselves. They didn't like the idea of people simply buying rare pets from the AH. <br />
<br />
Think of it as having the ability to buy King Krush or other rare hunter pets from the AH. It takes away a fair bit of the awesomness, not to mention removes the reason they exist: to get people out into the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But even with this change you can still go to the ah buy a max lv darkmoon pets or some other pets and still rolfstomp as you call it thought the system so yea this fixes nothing.<br />
<br />
And that is what pissing most of the people of that where looking forward to collect and sell, this lousy blue comment/reasoning that doesn't even make sense.<br />
because people can still buy rare quality max level pets its just less different pets but most likely enough to build a team anyway <br />
people will not explore more since the lazy people will just look the pets up for their super team and only specifically farm those and when they are done they will still sit in orgi and sw queuing.<br />
<br />
basically after maybe one or two months the areas will be mostly desolated anyway because the majority of the people will have the pets they want and there's no incentive to go back out again. <br />
<br />
for the other group of people that still will be going out for fun well they end up with rare or uncommon duplicates in there journal that will be useless and gathering dust.<br />
<br />
tbh I will most likely do the same I the change stays as it is. And I will make a list of the pets I want in rare quality and only focus on those and fill the rest of the journal with commons.</div></div><hr />
