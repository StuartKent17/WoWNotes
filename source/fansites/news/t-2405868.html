Battle for Azeroth Preview - PvP Rating Updates<br />
With the upcoming Battle for Azeroth expansion, we’re overhauling the game’s PvP progression and reward systems. Today, we wanted to take some time to break down those changes and provide some information on what Rated Battleground and Arena participants can look forward to.<br />
<br />
New Tiers and Rating Bands<br />
For years, participants in World of Warcraft’s Rated PvP have received numerical Elo-based ratings based on their performance, but what that number means to a player is fairly opaque. Participants currently have to wait until the very end of a PvP season for us to review the full standings and assign titles like Gladiator or Rival based on their relative standing.<br />
<br />
In Battle for Azeroth, we want to increase clarity and offer a more structured progression that recognizes players’ accomplishments in real time as they climb through the ranks. As players reach the following rating thresholds, they will enter formal brackets:<br />
<br />
<br />
Combatant: 1400–1599<br />
Challenger: 1600–1799<br />
Rival: 1800–2099<br />
Duelist: 2100–2399<br />
Gladiator: 2400+<br />
<br />
<br />
The specific rewards available in each of these brackets which will be clearly shown in the game’s interface so players can work their way toward earning the items they want most.<br />
<br />
Skill and Participation Rewards<br />
We’re focusing on two things as we delve into how players earn rewards for taking part in Rated PvP. One focus is refining and clarifying how we reward skill, and the other focus is providing clarity around how we reward participation at varying levels.<br />
<br />
Participation Matters<br />
The feedback we heard around Legion’s PvP rewards pointed toward players’ desire for a more controllable and predictable gearing path. To that end, we’re bringing back Conquest points as a measure of Rated PvP activity; we’re also offering a specific piece of raid-quality gear each week, adding up to full sets of increasing quality over the course of a season. This will make it so players have better visibility into how much time and effort they’ll need to put into earning a specific item and will counterbalance the random nature of rewards elsewhere in the system.<br />
<br />
We’re also changing how players can earn Vicious mounts. In the current Legion system, you need to win 100 Rated 3v3 Arena or 40 Rated Battleground matches. In Battle for Azeroth, Rated play in any bracket—including 2v2! —will count toward earning these mounts. And in line with our philosophy around making cosmetic rewards account-wide, your PvP efforts account-wide will count toward earning these rewards for your collection.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/thumb/PVPP01.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/PVPP01.jpg) <br />
<br />
In for the Skill<br />
With these updates, we want to make sure we’re providing PvP rewards that are commensurate with someone’s level of play. To this end, we’re adding an end-of-the week reward along the lines of the weekly Grand Challenger’s Bounty chests you can earn for doing Mythic Keystone dungeons. These weekly rewards can be collected from a chest in the Dueler’s Guild PvP hub in either Zuldazar (Horde) or Boralus (Alliance).<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/thumb/PVPP02.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/PVPP02.jpg) <br />
<br />
If you’ve filled up your Conquest bar for the week, you’ll receive a reward in the chest of an appropriate item level. The item level of the reward will be based on the highest bracket in which you won at least one game last week. For example, if you played and won at Duelist in 3v3, expect to receive a reward with an appropriate item level for your ranking at the end of the week. However, if you were rated as a Duelist in 3v3, but only participated in 2v2, you wouldn’t receive a Duelist level item unless you had won a game in 3v3.<br />
<br />
Who’s the Greatest?<br />
To help provide even more transparency, we’re adding regional tracking so that once you’ve reached Gladiator, you will be able to see where you rank in your region right within the interface. For those aiming to make your way to the very top of the rankings, you’ll be able to keep a close eye on just how far you have to go to get there, or even brag to your friends about just how far you’ve gone.<br />
<br />
End of the Season?<br />
We’re still in the process of working out the possible end-of-season rewards, but for now we can say we’ll be keeping the special seasonal Gladiator titles for the very top players at the end of each season. Those who get the Gladiator title will also need to win an additional number of games to earn the mount as their reward.<br />
<br />
We have more in store for PvP beyond Rated play, so be sure to check back here for more!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of blizzards players do not give a shit about rated pvp.<br />
<br />
That is false.Conquests points can be earned through warmode,random battleground and epic battlegrounds as well its pretty much the old pre legion CP system.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cambriz</div><div class="date">2018-06-21, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it is not. You cant farm Conquest points as you could farm honor before legion through random battlegrounds, as it is obviously limited to one battleground per day and one epic battleground per week both yielding a ridiculous amount of conquest. It is not even remotely comparable to the old honor system. Infact, random battlegrounds alone will never be able to yield enough conquest points to allow casual gamers to gear up in a useful way. Random battlegrounds will continue to drop loot boxes which contain low level blue gear, which means you have no active character progression from it alone.<br />
<br />
Warmode is nothing casual or solo gamers should use, as it suffers from faction imbalance and makes cannonfodder out of every casually playing gamer compared to guild groups or even raid groups which camp in open world pvp. As a solo player you will never be able to compete with any kind of guild group which farms warmode players. <br />
<br />
I advise every casually playing gamer to stay out of warmode. As long you dont want to be cannonfodder for raiders or guild groups.<br />
<br />
Rated PVP is not supposed to be only for the casual player. Your pvp rating is attached to what player you are. Example blow 1600 you are a casual player(raid finder gear), below 1800 you are a normal raid player, 2100 its a heroic raid player and 2400+ is a mythic raider. The gear will match your rating just like raiding levels match raiders gear. <br />
<br />
(all my numbers are made up and are just to show how the system is supposed to work). Before this, we had the second best geared pvp druid(rank 1 player) in worse gear than someone that did raid finder.</div></div><hr />

I honestly made an account just to tell you how fucking retarded you are. You start your whole argument off by saying how close to &quot;noone&quot; plays rated pvp and finish it with &quot;The thing is, and please read carefully, that the vast majority of players in World of Warcraft gives a shit about rated pvp&quot; probably just a miss type but either way you're a fucking retard. <br />
A huge population of the game has loved rated and would come back if they actually made some decent changes and mixed things up for us. Yet you dismiss the new opportunists because you want to play casual random battlegrounds.<br />
Freak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, and yes, an article about pvp rewards showing the random battleground queue probably also should talk about what players gain from playing random battlegrounds, no?<br />
<br />
What could they possible do? It's on the same level as WQs, normal dungeons etc. Harder the content = better the rewards. That's the core of all MMOs.</div></div><hr />

In the messaging before this they put emphasis on saying that these changes are to be attractive to casual players, in the hopes that more people would take part in competitive PvP. As others have said, there is still benefit to doing normal Randoms, as you earn conquest points for your first win. I'm also assuming that there will be similar random rewards for completing randoms as there is now in legion (challengers box etc).<br />
<br />
If you want to be super casual when it comes to PvP, then you aren't going to be getting those juicy rewards. You want to fill the conquest bar without doing competitive? You're going to have to take part in War Mode, War Fronts, etc. I think that's pretty fair. Just like with everything else in this game, the people who invest their time and efforts in any given activity should be rewarding for their efforts. If you're saying that doing random BGs should earn you enough conquest to cap, or earn you on par Gear, then i'm sorry Torish but you're wrong.<br />
<br />
If that still makes you mad, you should seriously consider playing something else. This is finally a positive change for the PvP community as a whole and more changes like this are positive for the pvp community and the game.</div></div><hr />

Nothing they do is ever going to make this attractive for those players. It didn't work when organized PVP was the only way to get good PVP gear, and it's not going to work now.<br />
<br />
WoW PVP is just unpopular and this focus on organized stuff above all else is part of it. But even that, if they fixed it, I don't think it'd really change anything. Anyone who cared about that stuff has all probably moved on by now. Long by now.</div></div><hr />

It looks to me like someone is a baddy and doesn't know how to world pvp. I understand and perhaps agree with some of your frustrations with gear progression for casuals, but don't generalize about world pvp or now warmode, being something ONLY guilds/raids will &quot;camp&quot;. I'm not even sure you've ever play on an active pvp server to understand how much that statement is false.</div></div><hr />

We did exactly 1 rated BG in Legion to understand this sucks, but i queue up with my 2 buddies for +100 random BG a week. PvE? useless shit, the this bigger trash mob cast ability X after X seconds, than Y after X second and again and again and again until the last brain-death understood move out of this shit ....... <br />

Hazzikostas is a dump ash, same as this 'community manager' if those guys ever manage a community ( i mean something different doing than sit in front of a cam and: hy guys ..... when they start to fix it(the community)? Hazzikostas about class balance, yes we will do this before the release, oh shit, no more time .... brilliant. NOT</div></div><hr />

Do not care much for that someone coming in late to the season or doing alts not only got to over come the persons skill but all so the gear it should of went back to the way it was in WoD some times its good to go back than to make things more complicated. They tried changing PvP in Legion and failed this will be just as bad. Just go back to the Old way of PvP gear and Ranking</div></div><hr />

You're asking about this bit:<br />
<br />
&quot;...we’ll be keeping the special seasonal Gladiator titles for the very top players at the end of each season. Those who get the Gladiator title will also need to win an additional number of games to earn the mount as their reward.&quot;<br />
What it's saying is the very top 0.01% of the pool will still be able to earn the permanent titles such as this season's Demonic Gladiator title. There will be people who fall into the Gladiator bracket who will be unable to meet that cutoff of the top % and will only earn the Gladiator title. This is how the title system works in Legion as well.<br />
<br />
What's confusing is that the team is leaning towards giving you the Gladiator title as soon as you get to the Gladiator bracket.<br />
<br />
This blue post does not mention that you will most likely earn a new title as you rise and fall in between the new brackets. However, it was mentioned (somewhere) that the development team was looking at how that will be handled. Most likely, they were leaning towards the title becomes yours as soon as the rating is obtained. This is currently different from Legion's X number of wins + being in the top .5% of the ladder earns the Gladiator title. <br />
<br />
That is why I believe the post mentions earning the Gladiator Mount as still requiring X number of wins. This was also mentioned (somewhere) that it will most likely be X number of wins while in the Gladiator cutoff bracket. It's because this new system is slightly restructuring the previous model of &quot;wait until the end of season for your rewards.&quot;<br />

Thank you, it does make sense. <br />
Mainly because titles got so inflated during the years, with a 2650 + cutoff<br />
Maybe it will fix my 2600 Duelist 4x in a row <br />

If so that`s quite disappointing, i enjoyed when i got lesser quality gear from doing casual PvP,<br />
and the better gear was reserved for people who did ranked.</div></div><hr />

Because you can't go into current content and grind out full Mythic gear in an Afternoon with 1-2 other people.<br />
<br />
And? I don't see your point. I should be able to get old elite sets of gear. They are just as old as Mythic gear. PVP are the real elitists. And I'm a mythic raider.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Old elite sets should be buyable with sufficient rating, it's incredibly idiotic that this is not the case already.</div></div><hr />

Get better then instead of crying because you can't get mythic level epics from god damn random BGs. Jesus christ! Does every article have to be about you and your interests?<br />
I think a lot of complaints are about raiders will get better pvp gear than casual PVPers even when the casual PvPers are the better PvPer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvP is more competitive in a strictly &quot;I was better than you at this time&quot; way. Elite Gear used to be one of the few things you could tell good and bad PvP'ers apart with.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like it.</div></div><hr />

Casual raiders get casual gear, good raiders get good gear. Same goes for PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Conquest points only will be available from rated pvp.<br />
<br />
Most of blizzards players do not give a shit about rated pvp.<br />
<br />
True .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excellent, we'll have people getting to 2400 first week of the season and sitting the rest of the season pushing the already dwindling arena participation even lower. Other than a small handful of anomaly seasons, when was 2400 ever glad?<br />
<br />
If you want to resolve the ambiguity of end-of-season rewards why do you have to hard-code in the cutoffs? Why can't you just use the new indicator found in the pvp tab to do the math and let them know where they fall in the brackets? <br />
<br />
I'm begging for someone to just tell me I've read this post wrong.<br />

As much as I hope that's true, it sounds like the change only applies to Vicious mounts, not glad mounts.</div></div><hr />
