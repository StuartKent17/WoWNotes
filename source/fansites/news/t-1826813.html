I Found Pepe! Achievement Not Possible<br />
It turns out that the I Found Pepe! (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10053-i-found-pepe) is not possible after all, explaining why no one has it.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Thistle Tea (http://www.wowdb.com/items/7676-thistle-tea) now gives NEGATIVE (-) 20 Energy when consumed. I hope this is a bug.<br />
Tooltip bug. It doesn’t consume any energy, but it doesn’t restore any either, at level 90+. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623665534182109184))<br />

btw serious question; as a mage when you try to pet nova on a mount is it intentional that it wont work until you get off the mount<br />
yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/623941732548280320))<br />

Can you please clarify what is affected by Sword of Light? Everything or only certain abilties?<br />
It affects most things, with a few exceptions. Conceptually it affects attacks with a weapon, even Judgment/Final Verdict. (1/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623666713847013376))<br />
But Exorcism and Holy Prism would not be affected, for example. (2/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623666756754784256))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/shaman) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#c))<br />
Legendary DPS ring doesn't seem to be counting damage done by searing totem/magma totem.<br />
Some totems are affected by the Legendary Rings a little unusually. They benefit twice from the damage increase... (1/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623668835686711296))<br />
...Instead of contributing to the explosion. Same total result. (2/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623668882889281536))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Why can't i use Nithramus, the all-seer as mistweaver, i can equip it but when i try to use it it says item is not ready yet<br />
The Legendary Rings only work for their intended roll. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623668029201743872))<br />
<br />
Timewalking<br />
Why are we being scaled to iLV 160 in Wrath TW dungeons, which are the heroic versions? We're 40 iLVs below dungeon drops(1/2)<br />
Post-squish, that’s close to an accurate ilvl. The feel of Wrath Timewalking is pretty authentic right now. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623664650714910720))<br />
<br />
Reputation / Questing<br />
Was said before 6.2 that the Celestial rep req. for Alani was going away soon. Is that in 6.2.1?<br />
Yes! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623653001400590337))<br />
<br />
If we clean Archimonde, then give back the 33 Tomes of Chaos. Can we still loot Crystallized Fel on a 2nd Arch kill same week?<br />
Unfortunately you cannot due to the way the tracking system works – we’re looking into future improvements here. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623665030957940736))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW and Game Design. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Dungeons<br />
But Ghostcrawler, (heroic) dungeons are hard! I really enjoyed the hard Cata dungeons most in the past few years<br />
Such an interesting time in my life. I couldn't motivate players to take on harder challenges and some never forgave me. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614860855079866368))<br />
<br />
World<br />
was the creation of vashj'ir at all inspired by your PhD in marine science<br />
No, though I did suggest the artists add pognophorans, which they did. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614584337166512128))<br />
<br />
Game Design<br />
Do you think elitism is healthy for a MMORPG? And would you design endgame around it?<br />
I think *aspiration* is very healthy. Not sure that must lead to elitism. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/616339297474482176))<br />
<br />
Can't make content last longer, but you sure can make it last much shorter.<br />
I think you can make content longer *if* you add rewards. I think there is a magical time to reward ratio. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614575974718443520))<br />
<br />
So here's a question - how do you distinguish content as reward from drawing things out?<br />
I think there is almost an internal clock of being ready for a reward / something new. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614644925854912512))<br />
Which is why you can't just add time without also adding rewards, extrinsic or intrinsic. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614645099432034304))<br />
<br />
I avoid games that I know I won’t be able to experience fully. Fallout 3, Skyrim, etc.<br />
Yes. Exactly. That's the problem I'm trying to fix. I can't eat all this food so I'm not even going to step inside the taqueria. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614654162672840704))<br />
<br />
That said I really love a game that's designed to be a single awesome 10-20 hour experience. Even a tad longer like DX:HR<br />
That's funny. I almost always play long games. I feel like short games aren't worth learning the rules. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614655247735091200))<br />
That is true even when it is an awesome short game so clearly it's not a rational conclusion on my part. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614655373308375041))<br />
<br />
I think there are short games and long games. To purposefully cut a long experience short seems wrong.<br />
But is Witcher 3 a short game with a lot of optional content or a long game? I'd argue the former. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614655550127640576))<br />
<br />
What's wrong with being compelled to do something interesting/engaging? (especially when optional) Genuine question<br />
Often they won't do it. They will look at the lovingly created content, appreciate the effort, and go play a smaller game. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614850259475238912))<br />
Any examples? This is blowing my mind<br />
The 500 quests in Dragon Age Inquisition. Turned some folks off who didn't want to skip content but couldn't commit either. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614859312435826688))<br />
<br />
Substance. Substance is more important than these &quot;rewards&quot; it's all just an illusion of progress if it lacks substance.<br />
I'm not sure I agree. Seeing a new room, earning a new piece of dialogue, or learning cut man's moves are all rewards. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614663133529944064))<br />
I don't think rewards are something dirty. I think they are why we find content compelling. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614663237699645440))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
if blizz offered you a completely absurd amount of money to come back to wow, would you?<br />
I am sure there is a number at which it would be dumb to say no. I don't think it's likely I will ever go back though (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/615378010166824960))<br />

That tweet is 15 hours old, I didn't wait for it. Nor could I have known it was coming. The news was a few hours later than normal today because I had family visiting today, got up early, was tired, and took a nap before I posted the news.</div></div><hr />

Oh please, don't you even try to blame the players for playing the game under de assumption that something present in the game should be possible to obtain.<br />

If the achievement is in the game from the start.<br />

<br />
What the hell do you expect players to do? they play the game, they try to solve the mistery and spend hours trying different things and looking around. <br />
<br />
Is not the players fault for playing the game. Is the devs fault for being so incompetent to include and achievement that can't be completed and not even mention it in the patch notes. Saying sorry after a month is a joke that just proves the fucks they give about their own game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, but you could have done something about the tanks getting one-shot by General Umbriss in Grim Batol (from full health to dead in one shot), or the fact that for nearly six months hybrid healers were fubar'ed. Six months it took them to mea culpa and fix what they broke. During which six months millions of players cancelled because he thinks they couldn't be motivated to &quot;take on harder challenges&quot;. Because there was apparently some super sekret way to avoid all of the obvious balance problems of early Cata, and the players were too dumb and unmotivated to figure it out. Oy. Dingleberry. :)<br />

Umm, what class diversity? My LFR Hellbreath from 2 weeks ago had 12 hunters in it. It was like a 3 minute queue time. I am not sure what the report is about.<br />
<br />
My healers get in within about 10 minutes, but my dpsers (I've queued LFR with a ret pally and a hunter in recent weeks) all wait between 1 hour and 3 hours. 90 minutes to 115 minutes is about average for them to get in. I'm not tanking this xpac but friends say they're instant.<br />
<br />
And yes, sometimes once I get in it's clearly got a lot of one or two classes in it - but I think that at some point, the system decides you've been in queue &quot;too long&quot; and starts putting you into groups regardless of class mix (tanks and heals notwithstanding, gotta have 2 and 5 of those).<br />
<br />
But it can, and will, sometimes make you wait 2 hours before it decides to let you in with 12 other ret pallies.</div></div><hr />

I imagine that there's simply too much. They know they don't want to play a single story for that length of time, or, they don't want a month of just tacos. The obvious solution is simply to set the games aside for a long time til they have a taste for that long game again, but often the length of time involved means you completely lose track of the game's story so you feel the need to start over from the beginning, in which case why bother even starting? Setting the games aside for merely a few days, a week, a month isn't long enough to develop an appetite to continue playing again.</div></div><hr />

And it is bad for the game how? The ability to freely move about in the game is bad for the game? You seem to think that it is bad for the game yet you don't say why it is.. I mean the ability to fly around once you reached max level has been around since Burning Crusade, and it was around during WoTLK when the game reached its peak.. <br />
<br />
The only time they allowed flying while leveling was during Cata.. But yet you say it is bad for the game and yet again you do not say why.. And if your excuse/reply is because you will bypass stuff on the ground and what not that ship sailed months ago.. Since everyone has pretty much done and seen everything already..</div></div><hr />

Yeah there is pretty much SFA to do with the shipyard now that I have completed the part of the legendary that requires it..

So far all I have gotten is a lot of Baleful armor missions, one that rewarded 2000 gold (never did it as did not have the GR's for it to equip my ships right) another that rewarded the ability to have the Blackmarket AH in your garrison (again did not have the GR's to equip my ships properly to do it).. <br />
<br />
And if not Baleful armor missions then it was sorcerous water or fire reward missions.. Most missions unfortunately only gave out XP and well all my ships are now epic quality so the XP ones are useless..</div></div><hr />

What if it's intended to be done during Hallow's End? Everyone can get costumes then so maybe Pepe randomly puts on costumes throughout the event. That'd just make the achievement miscategorized which could have been intentional to mislead people or a genuine mistake. Or it was categorized where it was just so it's in the same category as the original Pepe achievement just to make it easier to find. But if it has a Hallow's End achievement, it'd actually be enabled but not currently obtainable until October.<br />
<br />
If that's not the case, then it'd have to be obtainable in 6.2.1 because we might not see another patch until 7.0, and by then, what's the point to enabling the achievement? In that case, it should have just been added in the 7.0 patch. If it secretly hints at a 6.3, then what was the point in putting it in 6.2? I'm more inclined to believe it relates to Hallow's End.</div></div><hr />

Wait. Why does it matter if you have a LFR will 2 pally tanks, 6 pally healers, and the rest Ret pallies? If this is the reason why LFR for dps is so long. Blizzard is more stupid than I though. LFR doesn't need to have an even spread for classes..... It should just grab two tanks, 6 heals, and the number of DPS and go!</div></div><hr />

Most likely because of the way the player base treated him when he was working there. Honestly, as a paladin since BC, I don't miss him...it's been a shit xpac overall but relatively good for paladins of all flavors, especially prot.</div></div><hr />

If you believe the rumors, next xpac is getting Shadow Hunters, which will be shadowy healers and ranged dpsers who use ranged weapons and magic. <br />

The bad queue times are specifically for Hellfire Citadel. I can queue dps for the 6.0 raids and get in pretty quick. HFC takes an eternity, and that's where they have acknowledged the issue with trying to limit the class mix too much.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">randprin</div><div class="date">2015-07-29, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">as i see it, LFR queues are long for the following reasons:<br />
1. quite a lot of those that did LFR for gear no longer bother, tannan give better itemised and higher ilevel drops.<br />
2. with the introduction of renewable stone, the raiders who went for stones (and the sellers that acquired stones for those who did not care to run LFR) are no longer bothering with it.<br />
3. the abuse heaped on healers (and tanks) in LFR these days is amazing, speaking from the PoV of having 2 fully geared tanks, i'd rather wait for 3 hours and take a spot as a dps then suffer through the &quot;heroics&quot; of the Go Go crowd, the ninja pullers, the &quot;I stand in the green goo and who won't you heal me!!!&quot; heroes and all the other asinine behaviours which comes from the fact there are no consequences for bad behaviour.<br />
<br />
a special point regarding the legendary quest, I think lfr participation will drop very fast in a few weeks once most people have gotten past the tome phase, i can honestly say that if not for that phase i wouldn't set foot in HFC lfr.</div></div><hr />

This is certainly true in my case. In Mists, I completed five cloaks because I found the LFR fun enough and rewarding enough for my alts and I liked the visual effect. This expansion, I have zero alts on the legendary quest, and I get my books from normal, so the only time I go is to help out a friend or something. For myself and among people I know, at least, we are doing LFR much less this expansion.</div></div><hr />
