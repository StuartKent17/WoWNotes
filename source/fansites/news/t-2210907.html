Beast Mastery Hunter Changes in 7.2.5<br />
Hi Beast Masters. We’ve been reading your feedback and trying different sets of changes for Beast Mastery Hunters internally and on PTR.<br />
<br />
To start, we are reverting all 7.2.5 changes we’ve made so far to how Wild Call triggers. Instead, Dire Beast and Dire Frenzy will have 2 charges baseline. The Mantle of Command (legendary shoulders that currently add +1 charge to Dire Beast/Dire Frenzy) will be changed to instead further increase the proc chance of Wild Call. <br />
<br />
Overall, this will result in more Focus for all Beast Mastery Hunters, resulting in a more active rotation. Additionally, this gives all Beast Mastery Hunters access to a Dire Beast/Dire Frenzy with 2 charges playstyle that is more engaging and fun, allowing you to make decisions on when to use the buttons, instead of feeling like you should most often simply push them on cooldown.<br />
<br />
We’ve been trying other iterations of changes surrounding Dire Beast/Dire Frenzy and Wild Call, including increasing Dire Beast/Dire Frenzy Focus generation or versions that avoided changing the legendary shoulders drastically, but ultimately reached the conclusion that giving 2 charges to the abilities baseline, which many of you have asked for, was the best change for the spec at the current time. We appreciate your patience while we try different iterations on PTR.<br />
<br />
We are also making a few other less major changes to the spec in the next PTR patch, including:<br />
<br />
Aspect of the Wild will reduce the global cooldowns of your damaging abilities by 0.2 seconds, allowing you to more reliably spend the Focus you’re generating while it's active, especially with Dire Beast/Dire Frenzy going off. Kill Command and Dire Frenzy will cause your pet/Hati to charge up to 40 yds (up from 25 yds) to the target, matching the max range of your ranged abilities. When your pet casts Dash, Hati will also gain Dash for the same duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
FEEDBACK: Tomb Raid Finder Wing 1<br />
Tomb of Sargeras is now open for testing Raid Finder difficulty. Specifically, the first wing (The Gates of Hell) is now available on the PTR. We expect to keep the wing open for the entire weekend.<br />
<br />
Please use this thread for feedback and bug reports regarding the first wing encounters, or related issues. Noting the nature of your group (Mythic guild premade, PUG, etc.) is helpful, as are any logs.<br />
<br />
Thank you to everyone helps test!<br />

Relics<br />
IN the Q&amp;A you said relics would be throughput, yet all the rogue relics that drop off BS bosses are cloak, sprint etc<br />
We dropped our preliminary &quot;second bonus trait&quot; plan. As always, the base properties of Relics span the entire range of available traits. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/855485386876895232))<br />

Good day indeed, how do you feel about the 50% dampening games?<br />
Don't like it. We'll spend a lot of time looking into it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/856212494661976064))<br />
Do you feel like that causes another problem by making meta/balance changes with tournaments around the corner?<br />
Yup. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/856214204830818304))<br />

Thats not very blurry, as Blizzard still gets money for every subscription, just another player doing the paying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They gain an extra 25% revenue due to that and cut on RMT spam, slightly.<br />
<br />
Not like they couldn't count that as &quot;subscribers&quot; since it's just someone else paying for the token.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't really make sense, the people paying in gold are buying a subscription PAID FOR by somebody. And not even at standard subscription cost, they're paying an extra 33%. It just lets the people who have more money to spend spend more while keeping players who do not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They still count as subs, and their payment being in gold nets Blizzard more actual money even so.<br />
For a sub, I pay 12 euro. For a wow token to sell, I'd pay 20 euro. I buy my sub with gold, and thus create demand for wow tokens which someone else has to pay 20 euro for.<br />
<br />
There's nothing blurry about it.</div></div><hr />

Overwatch relies on whales for revenue past the initial sale. Doesn't really matter how many inactive accounts there are if every time a new event crops up a bunch of whales drop a hundred dollars on the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you misunderstand, Inactive accounts have no chance of purchasing microtransactions, Active accounts do.<br />
<br />
Whales don't make up 100% of the income, Normal people buy microtransactions too.</div></div><hr />

And what point does that even make to what I said. 30 million copies have still been sold. Regardless of if it has Microtransactions or not, that is a HUGE number of sales. That is rivaling even Call of Duty.</div></div><hr />

Yes, they may spend $15-20 here and there. Honestly, casual players (inactive players) are more likely to purchase lootboxes than people who play actively enough to earn them on a regular basis. And events and new hero releases renew interest for people who have stepped away from the game.</div></div><hr />

That's not even the point of the announcement. Overwatch is a homerun for Blizzard. It's now ranked with Skyrim, and the 13th most successful video game of all time. That's a major bragging point. It's not the money, it's that they did it. Why are you pissing on the parade? Does it bother you that the game is a success? Do you even understand why having a huge success like that is important to ANY company?</div></div><hr />

This got me laughing hard as my first laptop (not desktop) had Vista and it kept asking me over and over ARE YOU SURE to the point that I rolled it back to XP and dealt with there not being a sound driver for XP.</div></div><hr />
