Patch 6.2 - Mail PvP Armor<br />
One of the sets we didn't preview in the initial Patch 6.2 PTR post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4834-Patch-6-2-PTR-Build-19890) is the mail PvP set. These models are currently used on the blue and green quality gear for Warlords Season 2 and Season 3.<br />

How is the auto raid joining going to work exactly? there are still going to be groups focusing on getting their 300 kills, andâ€¦1/2<br />
..You will not be able to enter Ashran if you are in a raid. Once you are in Ashran, you are automatically placed in a raid. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/589279798016409600))<br />
Based on server? Random? 1 hour queues just to get curb stomped incoming. RIP Ashran. Never forget. <br />
We evenly distribute people to reduce wait times. Only time you wait now is in a premade. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/589306548880474112))<br />
how will that affect pre mades with group finder?. is that a done thing?<br />
it's a done thing. You can enter as a party but not a raid. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/589280068586721281))<br />

Tried to buy a WoW token from the AH, kept getting a msg that there are no tokens. <br />
That means that all listed tokens have been purchased - try again in a little while and there will probably be some available. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/589464513834946560))<br />

The WoW Token (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122284-wow-token) has remained ~37k in the EU and ~22k in the US over the last week or so. Please keep in mind our visitors do not represent the average WoW player.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Blizzard removed the Wealth category of statistics from the armory back in 2008, so we can't just pull data from the Armory API like we do normally. <br />

Rob Pardo Working With Unity<br />
You may remember that Rob Pardo left Blizzard last summer (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4131-Rob-Pardo-Leaving-Blizzard-Entertainment) and appears to have been enjoying his break judging by his Twitter feed (https://twitter.com/Rob_Pardo). It looks like he is going to spend some time working with Unity as a Creative Advisor (http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/04/22/rob-pardo-world-tour/), making a global tour to meet with developers. Blizzard used the Unity engine to create Hearthstone. Both GamesBeat (http://venturebeat.com/2015/04/22/world-of-warcrafts-lead-designer-joins-unity-as-creative-adviser-and-kicks-off-a-world-tour/) and gamesindustry.biz (http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-04-22-rob-pardo-partners-with-unity) have interviews with Pardo about his new role.<br />

Right now Ally or Horde, I can find premades doing what I want and doing it successfully, without needing 3rd party apps or websites. The group finder feature was working. Being auto invited to a raid without any choice will mean we are stuck doing what the majority wants, and if you don't want to do that then you will have to leave and reenter over and over until you find what you're looking for....<br />
Sounds like a whole lot of something that isn't fun. <br />
<br />
Ashran currently isn't competitive but its functional for what you want to do, without outside resources. The changes to events (if the removal of conquest goes through) will remove the bigger point of being there + these changes. Oh well lots of potential maybe next expansion they will get it right.</div></div><hr />

This way you have freedom to either click it or form a raid to do events. Just make it -easier- to form up for pvp, as that just isn't very intuitive atm.</div></div><hr />

Not at all actually. That is the largest window by far on the poll. You can technically have ten characters on a server and if all are gold capped that's nearly 10 million gold. technically, you can have 50 characters on an account for a maximum of near 50 million gold (in gold only, not trade goods). So, this is the poll option for all players with somewhere between 1 and 50 million gold, the largest range of any option on the poll. Generally when you get up in the 500-1 mil range you have enough to play the AH easily and if you do it well, you quickly get into the range above 1 million.</div></div><hr />

not really - a lot of those who are close to milion spend their gold on stupid stuff like TCG vanity items etc and thats why they dont hit higher.<br />

also its like irl - the more money you have the eaiser it is to invest and the bigger income you make without much effort but with using mainly you brain.</div></div><hr />

Not Familiar with GW specs but from what I can understand they:<br />
<br />
1. Removed some passives consolidated existing ones / added some more passives<br />
2. Consolidated abilities into core abilities etc. (as in MOP)<br />
3. Added elite specs which are like max level specs but more refined versions of a subset of specs. They also allow classes to use different weapons.<br />

<br />
Having a million gold was very uncommon in the end of WotLK/early Cata, but it wasn't impossible. Remember when Firelands came out? 378 items selling for 25k? People were soloing Firelands trash like crazy and the BoEs still sold for that amount. If you bought ore for 100g per stack you could prospect it and make 200g back. If you boosted people in CMs in MoP you could sell those boosts for a 100k or something and the best teams would even boost 2 people at the same time - I know boosters sitting on 4-5 million gold divided between servers. If you bought a Spectral Tiger card and sold both mounts you'd end up with 1.5 million gold or more. The inflation is crazy, and now more than ever with Treasure Hunters and garrison missions. 4k gold per mythic mission and 2k from blingtron missions? Yeah. <br />
<br />
In the game there are of course far less people with a million gold, but the average player barely even knows what wowhead is, meaning they're not voting on a poll like this.</div></div><hr />

Now who's the dumb one? lol<br />
<br />
I have I think around 80k on my account. But it's all in a personal guild bank, not on the characters, so I'd have to pay for a month to use a token. Or wait for a free &quot;Come back to WoW!&quot; week. <br />
<br />
Considering how many personal guilds there are, like mine, I'd say there's quite a few people who can't access the token system.<br />

it's lower than 1% on the overall WoW community, probably lower than 2% on MMO-C users (fansites ability/progress/economy curve is slightly shifted on the right). The only barely useful thing about this poll is the comparison between EU and US (assuming the amount of trolls are the same all over the world)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apexis</div><div class="date">2015-04-27, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, even in the subset of responding mmo users, most (~75%) have less than 300k and about 8.5% are 1M+. Is this, in any way, surprising to anybody?<br />
<br />
This no surprise to me, given what I been paying attention to over the years. I still think most players still sit in the 0-100k, even with all the gold availability. There are a lot of people that just don't farm gold and are always constantly begging for it. I myself I.m sitting at around the 750k level, mostly because I pick and chose times I am going to farm, otherwise I would been gold cap long ago. I don't piss around with the AH, my server is so large that the under cutters are at the plenty. I still from time to time mess around, but not like I once did. I been sitting on gold for so long now that I mainly just collect it now for something to do, because I have not seem much to purchase that is actually all that interesting.<br />
<br />
I still think the WoW token is going to be more of novelty once all the people with gold simply buy all the need for the next 5 years or more. The purchase of them will dwindle to a trickle after the initially massive gold hoarders are done.</div></div><hr />

But it's all in a personal guild bank, not on the characters, so I'd have to pay for a month to use a token. Or wait for a free &quot;Come back to WoW!&quot; week. <br />
<br />
Considering how many personal guilds there are, like mine, I'd say there's quite a few people who can't access the token system.<br />
<br />
You really should think before you call people dumb.<br />
<br />
You can buy the token on your bank character. I also have a personal guild bank and I used it to buy the token. It gives 30 days time to your account, not that particular toon. My guild character is on the realm with most of my active characters and I funnel money to her as well as things to auction, etc. As long as your personal guild character is on the same account as your active characters you will get the game time added to your account.</div></div><hr />

Remember when Firelands came out? 378 items selling for 25k? People were soloing Firelands trash like crazy and the BoEs still sold for that amount. If you bought ore for 100g per stack you could prospect it and make 200g back. If you boosted people in CMs in MoP you could sell those boosts for a 100k or something and the best teams would even boost 2 people at the same time - I know boosters sitting on 4-5 million gold divided between servers. If you bought a Spectral Tiger card and sold both mounts you'd end up with 1.5 million gold or more. The inflation is crazy, and now more than ever with Treasure Hunters and garrison missions. 4k gold per mythic mission and 2k from blingtron missions? Yeah. <br />
<br />
In the game there are of course far less people with a million gold, but the average player barely even knows what wowhead is, meaning they're not voting on a poll like this.<br />
<br />
Exactly and especially with very skilled multiboxers, they were farming mythic trash from first weeks of every content patch the last year.<br />
In my contacts i have at least 3 people who are account capped! and strangely enough thats about 8% of my contacts lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have 50 characters gold capped each with gold capped guild banks, you would have 100 million gold. The most you can have on one server is 22 million.</div></div><hr />

Nope. I'm looking at the character screen right now, the only option available for me is to pay real money. Also, all of my alts, all 7 of them, are in the same guild of mine.<br />

Thats not a Children's Week quest, that's a normal quest for that zone. I know, I made a point to enjoy the hell out of it each time I did it on 7 alts. I love that quest!</div></div><hr />

That means that all listed tokens have been purchased - try again in a little while and there will probably be some available.<br />
Uh, shouldn't that mean the price for tokens be sky-high? Absolutely, positively topped out at the maximum gp value rather than the pathetic 20k no one with half a brain is going to waste $20 on to keep them populated?<br />

Nope - just think about it. The price changes every 15min - When you price is low all the tokens get sold fast - the price can only raise 1%. Build it together.</div></div><hr />

You can petition to have a small amount of free time added to your account. Then use that time to withdraw from your personal guild bank or open a mail from your main account with gold and buy a token. I've done it on both my inactive accounts that had all their gold stored in guild bank.<br />
<br />
I find it unsurprising many players are willing to buy tokens for $20 to buy gold sinks they have never been able to afford. I also find it unsurprising the gold price for tokens is so low. The demand for tokens is pretty inelastic. Rich players only need one per account per month. In EVE online there is a demand for alt accounts because multiboxing is a massive force multiplier. WoW does not currently have a culture of multi account players. Until Blizzard makes other things purchasable for tokens the monthly demand will be fairly fixed. The obvious items would be expansions or store mounts but CCP games even made graphics cards purchasable with PLEX at one point.</div></div><hr />

If you mean me - I don't have any interest in playing, but thanks anyway. I unsubbed for reasons other than the cost - trust me, I can afford it.<br />
<br />
And, there is absolutely a multi boxing community in wow, fairly large, too, I used to be part of it, I ran a 5r man team in heroics in Wrath. Dual-boxing.com is kind of the main place to go for the community. If I were still multi boxing I would have been able to pay for all 5 accounts with tokens with ease.</div></div><hr />

not saying there isnt people with a lot of gold, but look at the actual numbers on the polls. and the expected graduation as you go up the list. you get to the bottom and the 1m mark and suddenly the numbers skyrocket. aka &quot;insecure people lying and clicking the highest number&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
More likely, if you can make 500k you can pretty easily make 1 mil. <br />
<br />
Since the more you have to invest, the faster the wealth grows, makes sense to have more that the bottom. Similarly, it's got the largest category of numbers- anything over 1 mil- rather than being striated.</div></div><hr />

Well, I have 1.2 million. Does that mean I am lying and should have clicked 750-1 million? Yeah, it is the people and not the poll...ofc it is. 44 000 voters in Us and about the same in EU and all lie the same way.</div></div><hr />

Why is it so difficult to understand the poll is flawed? lol<br />
<br />
If you want to see how much people really have, you need to have more than just 1 million+ option. It needs to be broken into sections, just like the other options are. That 1 million + option window is huge, you can have 1,000,000 exactly to having over 5, 10 million and there's a lot of people who have over 1million. Like myself, I have 1.2m<br />
<br />
It would have to be something like this:<br />
<br />
0-10k<br />
10-50k<br />
50-100k<br />
100k-500k<br />
500k-1mil<br />
1-1.5mil<br />
1.5-2mil<br />
2-3mil<br />
3-5mil<br />
5-10mil<br />
10m+<br />
<br />
Then you will see the numbers will get smaller, all the way down and not leave it with a huge window option at the end.</div></div><hr />

I think the point of the pole was more about those that have less than a million, then it was about the people that had more than a million.</div></div><hr />
