<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png&quot; title=&quot;Important&quot; /&gt; Overview - At the beginning of the encounter Garrosh calls Kor'kron Warbringers and Far Seers to assault the players alongside him. Siege Engineers periodically join the battle and try to activate the Kor'kron Iron Stars on the sides of the room. Killing a Siege Engineer will prevent him from activating his Iron Star, but an active Iron Star will also crush any Kor'kron orcs in its path. When Garrosh reaches 10% health remaining, he will draw upon the power of Y'Shaarj to heal himself, gaining new abilities and no longer calling orc soldiers to his aid. During this phase, Garrosh will periodically pull all players into the Realm of Y'Shaarj, where they must battle their way through Sha minions to reach Garrosh and interrupt his efforts to draw more power from the heart. Every 25 energy Garrosh is allowed to gain will empower one of his abilities. Upon being reduced to 10% health a second time, Garrosh will fully drain the Heart of Y'Shaarj, granting him 100 energy and empowering all his abilities until he is defeated.<br />
Stage One: The True Horde - Garrosh, wielding his new weapon with his True Horde and siege machines at his disposal, brings his might to bear upon any intruders.

Heroic Nazgrim's Execute: Where encounter design fails class design (Guardian tanks ....) Any fixes planned?<br />
Yeah, changing the way it works. Long term, we want Guardian less focused on dodge more on AM. High armor and health are cool. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363740719384494084))<br />

How does vengeance diminishing returns determine which is the primary vengeance target and which targets get reduced?<br />

&quot;Let me tank all that&quot; should never be a strategy because of mitigation or DPS increases. It should be to save non-tanks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363737431662538752))<br />

Outside of armor and stamina, what else would a tank look for in an upgrade to increase survivability?<br />
Haste makes a fine mitigation stat for paladins. It's not hard to imagine a role for crit and mastery is already tanky. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362451947866955779))<br />

I don't know why you think spriest is fine, but you really should consider taking a closer look at the spec. It has issues!!<br />
Every single spec thinks it has major issues that we don't understand or refuse to address. I sympathize but it's a no win for us. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363403669917544450))<br />
Same issues Shadow, indeed priests as a whole, always had; mobility issues. All it would take would be Phantasm base<br />

But isn't a lot of the ability bloat today due to CDs? Som rotational abilities, but a LOT of CDs, too.<br />

Possible MM hunters will be viable (progression raiding) again in 5.4? Haven't been able to play my favorite spec since 4.2 <br />
It's tough. We'd like for it to be a choice, but if websites say MM is 2% higher than SV/BM, a whole lot of players switch. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363738251216953345))<br />

If we're considering reducing button bloat for Hunters, can we talk about Widow Venom? Extremely clunky.<br />
Agreed. The challenge with that one is we don't want it to be passively applied for hunters either. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361995089364529152))<br />

We're not convinced Fire is going to scale out of control. Beyond say 50% crit or so, the value starts to decrease. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362460821000949761))<br />
I'm finding it very hard to swallow this statement, and so does other DPSers who compete with mages. Elaborate?<br />
Fire's DPS is a little high in ToT. We were worried they were going to scale much higher in SoO, but it may not happen. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362616356199346176))<br />

Do you think we spam heal HR and EF bubble the raid because we like it? There is no alternative, and 5.4 doesn't add any<br />
It's just the hot proc'ing and constantly refreshing the absorb that made the EF healing style a no-brainer. We want options. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362459127131287552))<br />
Ideally you could use LoD when clumped and EF when you wanted more finesse and didn't mind targeting multiple people. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362458964216119296))<br />
I don't target,I mouseover. Explain me how the 5.4 changes are making that happen in any way.<br />
Using LoD vs. EF (minus bubbles) don't feel any different to you? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362460290706706432))<br />
I just use LoD whenever 3hp or DP procs. No thought behind<br />
Then that sounds like the hot on EF needs to be stronger. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362463572401455104))<br />
<br />
Why does devotion aura still only work on phys dmg, hpalas will be the only healer without raid cds on some fights in siege.<br />
Because it's very good in other situations. Encounter designers often consider Devo Aura the one they need to balance around. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362462464417337344))<br />
<br />
And don't say jack of all trades. Every Holy Priest knows that has never ever worked.<br />
You think it should be bubbling the whole raid with EF spam? That's what we're trying to avoid. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362371464323796992))<br />
For the last time, we AGREE that EF blanketing had to be removed in some way. However, we need a different NICHE in return.<br />
Not all paladins agree. That's mainly who I'm talking to. I am glad you do though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362455509506326528))<br />
My view is that you'\re not changing our EF blanketing ways. You're just making us worse at it in 25<br />
Then perhaps we haven't hit the sweet spot for SH and SS tuning (and possibly LoD). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362461452247891969))<br />
If you take EF, we're kind of okay with that. If every Holy paladin still does, then I agree we haven't fixed the problem. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362461535274151937))<br />
<br />
jack of all trades is inevitable given 10m raiding now - every healer must be able to do 'everything'. Less specialty = less fun.<br />
To a point, but a druid and monk use pretty different spells to heal. We can't say e.g. druid you will be a bad tank healer. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362459575707910144))<br />
It might be possible to bucketize the healers into a ST or AE healer and then dictate you need one of each. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362459810068828160))<br />
Not sure that design is superior though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362459844248207360))<br />
<br />
I guess the only way to put through to you the state of hpally is to say &quot;We told you so&quot; when they are bottom of every fight.<br />
If by bottom you mean HPS, isn't the EF nerf like &lt; 5% HPS? Doesn't sound very harsh. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362073100080250880))<br />
EF nerf is way bigger than 5%. Seriously, would you have even had it on your radar if it was that little?<br />
So what am I missing? How is it way bigger than 5%? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362367412600971264))<br />
And we lose more than 5%. Hpallies lose their playstyle. And &quot;new&quot; playstyle with SH is not fun for 95% of community<br />
Not sure you can speak for 95% of the community, but if around 30% chose SH, that would be just about ideal. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362458541782597632))<br />
<br />
I don't think they weren't fair,but taken like a direct % you forget that EF is spread and that it refreshes IH to 45 secs.<br />
Yeah, EF spreading is cool and should be a strength of choosing that talent. It's just IH that makes it the only choice in 5.3. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362449863251726336))<br />
<br />
Last but not least, why are you still dodging the 5.4 Pala niche question? U said you don't want us EF bubbling the raid...<br />
I don't like niche questions in general because I feel like players try to use them to lawyer us too much. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362448969961439232))<br />
If I say druids are supposed to be the masters of hots, then folks drag that out whenever they cast a non-hot or someone else hots. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362449149842567170))<br />
Our intent is that specs have depth and nuance, and that doesn't compress nicely into 140 characters. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362449219656753152))<br />
But I think it is fair to say that nobody went into MoP thinking paladins were the masters of hot based absorbs and needed more. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362449344542146560))<br />
We just overbuffed Eternal Flame at the last minute before launch. Perhaps it even masked weaknesses in other areas. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362449469373022208))<br />
<br />
Let's say EF does 13% of your healing+absorbs. So the hot does 3-4% of total healing+absorbs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362366214133125121))<br />
Even EF's refreshing the absorb is an important aspect, one that you keep forgetting.<br />
No I think that's fair, though it's hard to quantify as part of the mythical &quot;way bigger than 5%.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362369706243522560))<br />
And SOI nerf was 10% of our total mana gained per fight, new DP &quot;compensate&quot; ~3-4%<br />
But if you only count the healing (say about 50%) then EF's HoT was only 6-7% of total healing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362366795644018690))<br />
This means absorbs are going to be reduced to 93-94% of what they currently are, or a loss of 6-7% of absorbs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362367070706466818))<br />
If your absorbs are 50% of healing+absorbs, then you'll lose about 3% of your total throughput. BoL loss would be a little more. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362367367591895042))<br />
But it also leads to the whole &quot;I can't function without EF&quot; which isn't the design we want for paladins. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362369797377372160))<br />
I've said this a few times, but we never balanced paladin mana around 100% SoI uptime because we knew that wasn't realistic. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362371301115047936))<br />
<br />
Most of us Holy paladins are going to get the boot from our raiding guilds with all these damn nerfs!!!<br />
Aside from EF (which is small) and SoI (which we compensated for), which nerfs are you talking about? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362081933829750784))<br />
The talents are fairly competitive with one another, but overall we've lost a ton of strength from that tier<br />
We buffed the finishers to help compensate for that and we can buff them more if needed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362310039966461953))<br />
Tier 45 does not need to be the entire solution to making Holy Paladins work. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362310124796248067))<br />
<br />
what's the reasoning behind the Judgment mana increase? Are there other changes coming?<br />
Paladins dropping all Spirit to use SH wasn't the intent. We'd rather it compete on utility / HPS grounds not super efficiency. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362075747650772993))<br />
But monks dropping all Spirit is fine? Even with 9k Spirit and old SH we could barely compete in 10s.<br />
Monks don't do it if they choose the right talent. We don't think the mana or tools choice for paladins would be very fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362081692573368321))<br />
<br />
Biggest Ret AE problem is having to choose ST/AE Talents/Glyphs OOC and be stuck with them the whole fight.<br />
That's part of the intent though. If you have everything available precisely and only when you need it, there's no choice. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362075331399647233))<br />

We're considering fixing the double SW: D thing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363403329373614081))<br />
No disrespect, but the double SW: D thing is barely a thing. We need damage output tuning, sp for ST.<br />
We're fine with Shadow DPS. It's where it should be if you're not comparing yourself to mage and lock, which are too high. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363462609158144002))<br />
Sorry, Sir, but people don't compare to the middle in any sport. They compare to the #1 within their category.<br />
That's fine, but if they compare themselves to outliers, they're not going to be happy with our response. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363739993421778944))<br />
For the &quot;I like to link Raidbots&quot; crowd, maybe always compare your DPS to the fourth on the chart? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363740125945004032))<br />
<br />
A little confused with something I just read. Did holy nova just get nerfed for 5.4? Why on earth? It was useless anyway.<br />
We removed the meteor but put on a target cap. It's a glyph, not intended to be the power house of the rotation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363736689111343104))<br />
Also not sure the glyph is the right call. I worry we caved beneath the &quot;I must have destealth!&quot; crowd. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363736835429629955))<br />
Can Shadow get something to cast while moving? We can't Pain because it wipes our DoTs. Fel Flame if you are feeling lazy?<br />
We don't want to add a new spell at this stage, but we would like to solve the problem. This is one of those hate snapshot deals. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363465364446785536))<br />
SoO does have a lot of multidot fights though and we can make sure Shadow is up there with Affliction and Balance on multidot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363467101127704577))<br />
And multidot in turn has a better chance of being able to use SW:P while moving, because there's a non-snapshotted target. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363467230878515201))<br />
Some one already suggested getting mindspike back up to something usefull, idea?<br />
For example, Mind Spike with no dot removal &gt; Mind Flay if I'm not mistaken. There's also the talent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363735793832960000))<br />
<br />
Do you have any plans to fix the latency on Shadow Word: Death's activation?<br />
There is no easy way to do that since the game has to detect that the target is injured. Longer term it might be possible. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363730992122441729))<br />
<br />
not sure if it's true but I saw a PWS nerf on MMO champion, unfortunately the post vanished.Just curious if you plan on a nerf<br />
Nothing beyond the Rapture change already in as far as I can recollect. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363404770792308738))<br />
<br />
what would you think about letting #spriest charge orbs out of combat, similar to moonkin, so we can pull with 3 orbs? #wow<br />
We'd rather do the opposite and drain all resources when combat begins. It's just complex to do. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363403026318368769))<br />

Have you guys got any plans to look at making combat the top rogue spec? playing mostly assass for 3 patches is getting old!<br />
We wish Combat were closer, yes. In 5.2(?), we wanted to nerf C's cleave and buff their ST, but don't think we buffed it enough. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362464287651921920))<br />
<br />
You mentioned agreeing rogue specs need to be looked at. Any thing to discuss currently? Warlock level rehaul in the future?<br />
Note that is GC random musings, not any kind of official announcement. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362457857234436098))<br />
Unlikely to be at the warlock level with vastly different resources. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362457571346489345))<br />
More on the table would be something like one spec has Rupture, one uses Recuperate rotationally, and one uses SnD. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362457707149656066))<br />
<br />
why are you evading all rogue questions ? The class has had nearly no attention throughout mop, less than Shaman!<br />

Glyph of Everlasting Affliction has been replaced by Glyph of Eternal Resolve - wow no one wants that crappy change<br />
Glyph of EA was a trap for most players. Duration less useful because of snapshotting. What did you like about it? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363739410262528002))<br />
(I should add that UVLS and Wild Imps felt like an exploit more than a cool mechanic.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363739515002687488))<br />
<br />
Also make Harvest Life back into an AOE spell - stop with the crappy changes to us locks. So far 9/10 lock changes so far suck<br />
We found hardly anyone was using Harvest Life. That's not always the only concern, but we didn't think it was salvageable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363738606214455296))<br />

Do you regret adding so much unique utility in MoP? It's too powerful to ignore from a heroic raid leading perspective.<br />

Will we ever see heroic leap remove snares? Druids can literally spam out of roots and dps pressure, but heroic leap is 30secs<br />

Will tank damage really be more in in line in 5.4. It seems like prot warriors will again be at the bottom.<br />

Still near worthless in PVE. Almost every other class has a (near) immunity effect or dmg absorption.<br />

Any thoughts on Fury DPS being a tad low, combined with our mediocre defensive cooldowns? 5.4, Fury isn't really shining.<br />
Fury's defensive cooldowns are fine, IMO, especially with the change to shields. My hunch is their DPS is too low in 5.4 ATM. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362358951964196865))<br />

Weekly News Recap<br />
Another busy week full of news, so here is your chance to catch up! <br />
<br />
<br />
July 28<br />
<br />
We looked at the Stormcrow mount (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3320-Patch-5-4-Stormcrow-Mount-Ghostcrawler-Interview-Blue-Posts-News-Recap).<br />
Ghostcrawler did an interview:<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4 is the final raid patch for Mists of Pandaria and ends with players defeating Garrosh and setting events in motion for a new warchief. Unfortunately, we will have to wait a little bit longer to see who that will be. <br />
WoW won't be going free to play anytime soon, as Blizzard is happy with the current business model. Even if they wanted to make it into a microtransaction based game, it couldn't be done with how gameplay works today. <br />
The devs want people to be able to catch up faster so that they can play with friends, which is why they are testing the experience buff (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/146939-enduring-elixir-of-wisdom) and other convenience items in the Blizzard store. There is no desire to move towards a pay to win style game.<br />
<br />
<br />
July 29<br />
<br />
We looked at the new Timeless Isle armor (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3321-Ghostcrawler-Interview-Timeless-Isle-Armor-5-4-Notes-Update-Blue-Posts-TCG-Art) coming in Patch 5.4. This will add a relatively easy to obtain set of item level 496 gear, and a set that you can grind for that is item level 535. Patch 5.4 normal difficulty gear has an item level of 553, while flex gear is 540, and raid finder gear is 528.<br />
The Patch 5.4 PTR notes were updated with another round of class changes.<br />
Ghostcrawler did another interview:<br />
<br />
The item level squish (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2541-The-Great-Item-Squish-%28or-Not%29-of-Pandaria) might take place next expansion. (See tweet (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362307978944200705))<br />
The Lesser Charms that may be added to the Asian store are there as a convenience item for players that may not have time to do their daily quests that week or players who just want to save time. There are no plans to add items to the store that will increase player stats.<br />
<br />
<br />
July 30<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler replied to some item level squish feedback (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3322-Item-Level-Squish-Kor-kron-Dark-Shaman-5-4-RPPM-Mechanics-Change-Blue-Posts-Art).<br />
We looked at the Kor'kron Dark Shaman encounter (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3322-Item-Level-Squish-Kor-kron-Dark-Shaman-5-4-RPPM-Mechanics-Change-Blue-Posts-Art) in Siege of Orgrimmar. <br />
Some changes to RPPM mechanics (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265372-change-to-rppm-mechanics/) were announced.<br />
<br />
July 31<br />
<br />
We looked at the UI for the in-game store (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3324-Patch-5-4-In-Game-Store-Patch-5-4-Mage-Glyphs-Blue-Posts-Blue-Tweets-DLC-400).<br />
We looked at the new mage glyphs (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3324-Patch-5-4-In-Game-Store-Patch-5-4-Mage-Glyphs-Blue-Posts-Blue-Tweets-DLC-400) coming in Patch 5.4.<br />
<br />
August 1<br />
<br />
The Q2 Earnings call took place: <br />
<br />
Titan will not be a subscription based MMO. Blizzard is still working on a new direction and plan for the project.<br />
The decline in subscribers in Q2 was more evenly split between Asia and the West.<br />
The subscriber churn rate was very positively impacted by Patch 5.2 and 5.3.<br />
Blizzard All-Stars is in wider internal testing and will be talked about more later this year.<br />
<br />
There was a new PTR build (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3327-Q2-Earnings-Call-Patch-5-4-PTR-Build-17260):<br />
<br />
Some new Bind on Account epic weapons (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-build=17260&amp;filter-bind=10&amp;filter-quality=16) were added, but the item levels aren't final.<br />
The Throne of Thunder debuff (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/149070-shado-pan-onslaught#17247-17260) has been added.<br />
Siege of Orgrimmar loot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-build=17260) has been added, making for 100s of new items in this build. <br />
<br />
<br />
August 2<br />
<br />
We looked at the Stormwind Harbor (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3328-SoO-Stormwind-Harbor-5-4-Notes-Update-RPPM-and-Haste-Changes-Blue-Posts-TCG-Art) that is part of the Siege of Orgrimmar encounter. <br />
The Patch 5.4 PTR notes were updated (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3328-SoO-Stormwind-Harbor-5-4-Notes-Update-RPPM-and-Haste-Changes-Blue-Posts-TCG-Art) with several more class changes.<br />
More RPPM changes were announced (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265372-change-to-rppm-mechanics/), this time dealing with how Hast interacts with RPPM mechanics. We listed the value changes in this table (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3328-SoO-Stormwind-Harbor-5-4-Notes-Update-RPPM-and-Haste-Changes-Blue-Posts-TCG-Art).<br />

You can hate them all you want, just be glad they exist. No other game puts devs out on the front line as much as World of Warcraft does. I'm glad its not like back in Vanilla, BC, and Wrath where all we got were patch notes every 5 months and 0 input in between.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They dont get to upgrade 4 times. All items are 8ilvls higher by default. Meaning they are &quot;2/2&quot;. Wowprogress shows it as 4/4 because after they upgrade it, the WoWHead tooltips dont know what to do so they assume that it was just upgraded more.</div></div><hr />

You're going from a slippery slope and just jumping off the cliff. They already said that isnt going to happen. <br />
Lesser Charms dont grant player power, and they dont grant anything you can already get in game. <br />
Saying its the next logical step is like saying &quot;Well, the next step is obviously going to just mail us epic gear&quot;. Which people have been saying since Burning Crusade came out. And It still hasnt happened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would we? They said they would only be getting double lockouts and it would not come here. They said the charms are coming here. So warning us that it's china &quot;initially&quot; doesn't mean shit. They get them a week before us it still counts as &quot;initially&quot;. Pay to win incoming. And yes it's pay to win, charms give a chance at gear, with stats. The very definition of pay to win.<br />

You're going from a slippery slope and just jumping off the cliff. They already said that isnt going to happen. <br />
Lesser Charms dont grant player power, and they dont grant anything you can already get in game. <br />
Saying its the next logical step is like saying &quot;Well, the next step is obviously going to just mail us epic gear&quot;. Which people have been saying since Burning Crusade came out. And It still hasnt happened.<br />

I've had epic gear mailed to me from the twisting nether. So, yeah.</div></div><hr />

How is paying for that pay to win? Do you win your rolls 100% of the time? No? Then you're a kneejerk reactionary. I'd rather pay to have my charms because I barely am able to play anyways. The difference between you and I is, if you lose the roll, you lost 10 minutes. If I lose the roll, I lose $X. So suck it up princesses. By your silly logic, anything that saves time is &quot;pay to win&quot;. (See: ports, mounts, dungeon finder, raid finder)<br />
<br />
NOBODY should be able to have an advantage over someone else in this game all because they make more money. You leveling your character faster than me because you have more disposable income is bullshit. You not having to do dailies because you have more money than me is bullshit. They didn't design an entire in game store with its own little button in the UI to just sell xp and charms and then stop. More is to come. More advantages for people with money. It's pay to win.

<br />
Getting the mount WILL show you killed him in current content. It's a reward for Ahead of the Curve, which is killing him before the next raid comes out. Though more than likely that will be the next expansion unless they decide to have Wrathion go crazy. Feeling this is going to be another DS tier.</div></div><hr />

And for the pay to win, it's not like you win anything from buying coins. You save a little extra time like some people already said. It's not really an advantage because you can farm 50 coins easily so if you are mad at people buying coins because you can't afford them just go spend 30 minutes of farming wherever and you will get them.</div></div><hr />

So using that as an argument is ridiculous. Pay to win is having an advantage over others because you're better off irl. Leveling faster is an advantage. Especially when you have things like open raid spots, or getting your character to 90 before the reset so you can have an extra week at LFR. Also you must be incredibly naive to think that charms are going to continue to be easy to acquire in the next expansion. It's basic common sense, if leveling and charms and whatever other crap they have coming to the store is easy then nobody will buy them. Look to other mmo's that sell that stuff. I know of a couple who increased xp to level right when they put xp boosts on the store. If I'm standing next to a lake trying to sell you water I'm not going to make any money. If I pump out the lake I'm rich.</div></div><hr />

It is hard to grasp for some, you are included. So if they sell gear with stats on it, that's not pay to win according to you. Since the people that don't pay can still obtain it. They're just saving time by not having to raid. Yeah, I thought so. This game is all about time investment. When you're charging extra to save time it's an advantage.

It's Cataclysm bad ideas ALL OVER AGAIN... Just like the start of the last expansion, when Blizzard threw away their philosophy from not letting players to &quot;game the system&quot; to stimulating that. <br />
<br />
Now they are stimulating people to not explore the world, after they build the entire expansion around putting people exploring the world.<br />

Saving yourself a few dailies is hardly the same as buying items that directly empower your character. Blizzard already said they aren't moving towards P2W and won't sell gear with stats.</div></div><hr />

No need. Highest end guilds get the fight down, wipe, and bring in other members of their core since it's PTR. This way all 25-30 people can see the fight and know how to handle it on live. Live is a race for them, and they want to utilize the full hour of testing.</div></div><hr />

ROFL... how does it feel Rogues? being at the bottom? Shamans have been asking for some respect(for the players that play shamans) for years! Blizzard sucks shit at balance and they have HUGE class favoritism going on!

When homogenizing top specs like fire mages or warlocks, that is nice and should be done.<br />
When people ask for a little more abilities or damage tuning on a shadow priest to be on par with everyone, it is always &quot;no we don't want everyone to be similar&quot;. Same with bear issues. Fucking Ghostcrawler. What the hell? I want to DPS as much as mage/lock do, and I have all the fucking rights to do so. There is no more mystical &quot;hybrid tax&quot;, and locks, while being pure and top dps, still bring way more raid utility than SP, and way more survivability. Why the hell must I be in the 4th place? Isn't that a super shitty design when everyone ought to be equal but mages and locks are always more equal than other classes?</div></div><hr />

So if they sell gear with stats on it, that's not pay to win according to you. Since the people that don't pay can still obtain it. They're just saving time by not having to raid. Yeah, I thought so. This game is all about time investment. When you're charging extra to save time it's an advantage. I can try and type slower so maybe you can understand.<br />

They also said they would &quot;never&quot; do faction transfers. Whenever Blizzard says 'we don't want' or 'we never intend' it usually means &quot;Right now we think this, but that may not apply to the future&quot;<br />

They want to nerf mages and warlocks though, not SPs.<br />
<br />
The reason I stopped playing Shadow however, is the lack of CDs. Feels like I do bugger all damage when Shadowfiend is on CD and I don't get to start with 3 orbs.<br />
You can't design a dps spec whose dps cds are pretty much all talents, when the design is that you PICK AND CHOOSE talents.</div></div><hr />

That's not quite true. Almost every current MMO uses Twitter the way GC does. GC admitted it's better than forums (which he barely reads any more) because it's short and to the point. Now, everyone else is following his lead. Unfortunately, he has a very douchy attitude on Twitter. It's almost like he lost his love for the game. TBH I'd rather he not tweet than be such a dickhead in 3/4 of what he does tweet.</div></div><hr />

Just like buying crafted gear from AH to skip some of the gear farm at the begining of the xpac. Except that you're throwing money outside of the game for it instead of farming mats/gold ingame.<br />

This. I have never seen anyone bicth about RaF and that buff is far more insane than buying 100% XP. I remember me and a friend level 5 1 - 60's in 1 week when was getting him into the game.<br />
As for people saying &quot; Oh this is B2W for world 1st 95 next expansion&quot; People use your fucking brain. You will only be able to buy the EXP buff on for toons that have hit the max level cap for that expansion. It's already been confirmed so use google for once and open your fucking eyes.<br />
<br />
Lol @ the idiots that say they are adding tier gear. Never going to happen. Ever. I could see experience as people have been asking for it since Vanilla. Because if they just added tiergear to the shop. there goes the reasons to make heroics dungeon's therefore goes a massive gearing gap and part of the general game experience. Sorry but your a tool if you think blizzard is that dumb. They don't make billions because they are stupid.<br />
<br />
Lets say in a dream they do add full heroic sets to the game. Great! Now more that 1% of the player base can get gear. Fuck all you snowflake fucks. A real cash shop would sort out how's really pro.<br />
People who are winning at RL + Got the skills &gt; No life people who are broke + Got the time to get the best gear. Your tears are delicious.</div></div><hr />

You leveling your character faster than me because you have more disposable income is bullshit. You not having to do dailies because you have more money than me is bullshit. They didn't design an entire in game store with its own little button in the UI to just sell xp and charms and then stop. More is to come. More advantages for people with money. It's pay to win. Pay to win is defined as having an advantage over other players using cash.<br />
<br />
So RAF and Scroll of Resurrections are against your principles and break the game for you too?<br />
<br />
Bunch of whiners completely out of sync with reality. These Lesser Charms will save a margin of people doing 'x' dailies per month. But those people will miss out on the RNG bonuses like Keys, Treasure Chests and such along the way. So paying up for the Lesser Charms is really a trivial convenience and Blizzard know it. It's a point of convenience that does not detract from the experience or rewards from those whom do not partake in purchasing Charms via the store.</div></div><hr />

Why would a 25man guild competing for world firsts kill him with 10 people before testing is over? They are going to utilize the full 1-2 hours of testing and rotate as many of their raiders in as possible.

.5 is not 0.<br />

They have failed.</div></div><hr />

To the contrary, he knows exactly what P2W means. It doesn't only mean, &quot;ONCE I PAY, I HAVE INSTANTLY WON THE GAME!&quot; It means paying for in-game, tangible advantages.<br />
<br />
Here, you fork out $$, skip dailies. This allows you to gain power for your character in other ways while people who don't fork out $$ are left grinding hours of dailies a week. This is an in-game, tangible advantage, paid for with real $$. Also known as pay to win.<br />
<br />
Is it a huge deal? No. Is it worth &quot;complaining&quot; about? I think so, especially in a subscription-based game. Am I worried this is a mere taste of what's to come? Sure I am. I've been playing WoW since 2004, and I'd hate to quit now just because their philosophies have taken a shift towards $$&gt;all.</div></div><hr />

The reason I stopped playing Shadow however, is the lack of CDs. Feels like I do bugger all damage when Shadowfiend is on CD and I don't get to start with 3 orbs.<br />
You can't design a dps spec whose dps cds are pretty much all talents, when the design is that you PICK AND CHOOSE talents.<br />
<br />
Oh really? Well, I'm playing since BC, and if everytime Blizz said they are gonna nerf warlocks and mages someone gives me 1$, I'm gonna be a multibillionaire at this moment for sure. They've already nerfed SP up to the ground since we don't have any survivability, our utility is overhealing shit and our damage is shit anytime when there is no 3 targets to dot. Our talents are shit, because we're forced to take Insanity and DI, since everything else is being sacrificed to the mystical pvp balance. We have no dps cooldowns, since &quot;we're not gonna make every class the same&quot;. We're at the bottom in 5.4, in fact. And that is kind of super nice class balance for us Shadowpriests to just cancel subs or start playing fucking mage (which fire spec, by the way, is beyond ridiculisness in terms of stupid overpoweredness in damage). Good job, blizz, good job. Continue to do this shit and then in q4 start wonder, why are people leaving your nice, balanced for mages and warlocks, game.</div></div><hr />

He gets to skip the grind for how many weeks he is willing to pay, Blizzard gets more funding to continue to make the games we love, there's a limit that we share to prevent that rich dude to gaining an obvious advantage. It's a win situation for everyone involved. <br />
<br />
But if these...&quot;whiners&quot; are so damn hell bent on balance, then perhaps they can start contributing by checking their computer.<br />
<br />
- It better not have anything in it that will allow you better performance than a shoebox computer just meeting the recommended performance of the game. It's definitely yours truly, P2Win.<br />
- Mouse and keyboard has reprogrammable hotkeys and macros? throw that shit out, unfair advantage. <br />
- Using ventrilo/mumble/teamspeak that has better clarity and dedicated connection for voice communication? Turn it off and use blizzard voice chat thank you very much.<br />
- Dual or multiple screen enabling you to read strats while clearing a boss faster? stick to the dungeon journal buddy, and donate that other screen to the local charity. Might as well do your bit towards humanity while championing for true unadulterated game-balance. <br />
- Addons during arena and battleground? Be like the arena pros, turn those clutches off<br />
<br />
Else these &quot;Game balance champions&quot; are just hypocrites.<br />
<br />
Your comment is bullshit, and you know it. Macro oriented peripherals are banned from competitive play because of unfair advantages, which part of pay to win is that though? You want blizzard to monitor what you plug into your computer so I can't keybind shieldwall to my razer naga???????<br />
<br />
Blizzard putting in currency to buy tokens so one person has to do dailies and the one spending money can not do it, or buy them and do them for double the currency, is PAY TO WIN. You know what makes it worse? The fact that these tokens give you a chance at literally the best loot in the game. Did you think about that at all?<br />
<br />
Either you're trolling, or are super delusional.</div></div><hr />

No P2W is when you fork over real cash for items, skills, etc that can only be obtained in such a way that provides you with an advantage that other MUST also spend money to be on equal footing with you.<br />
<br />
So no these charms and xp boosts are not pay to win, people who don't pay can also reach the same &quot;power level&quot;.<br />
<br />
To many confuse PFC and P2W.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus if people think this is P2W now, wonder why they never had this issue when sites/guild/players were selling raid gear and what not.</div></div><hr />

Did you think about it at all? Repeat what you said.<br />
<br />
Then remember to even get the chance to roll on that loot you have to kill the boss that drops it.<br />
<br />
Then remember anyone else can get the same bonus roll via a very small amount of work.<br />
<br />
Then remember regardless of effort, time or money you can never get more then three per week.<br />
<br />
Seriously, does no-one even think before they motormouth anymore?<br />

Hypocrisy. Wouldn't suprise me if most of the ragers either bought their services or sold them.<br />
<br />
People don't like losing control over an advantagous situation. I imagine a lot of the backlash towards Diablo 3's Auction House (before launch - post launch most of us could see issues with its implimentation) was from people who sold D2 gear and accounts on Ebay.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mazaxist</div><div class="date">2013-08-06, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the day they start selling THE BEST gear ONLY obtainable with real $$ i think we should be allrite. <br />
<br />
for example - best 25 heroic gear ilvl is 550 ( this is just an example, not an actual ilvl )<br />
<br />
in store ONLY epics - ilvl 590. for $25 per item. = this is when i quit the game. this is why i quit diablo too</div></div><hr />

Even if they wanted to make it into a microtransaction based game, it couldn't be done with how gameplay works today.<br />
<br />
It would be better to go free to play. The new transmog-items which you can buy and the in-game store are just the beginning, and imo it's wrong to feed on Blizzard this way. I pay for every month I play, isn't that enough? No, there have to be items you can buy to change your style and flasks which will help you leveling faster.. is that really necessary? I guess there's a bunch of guys who want this really hard, but imo it destroys the &quot;feeling&quot; in-game. Atm it's easy to level fast (especially with &quot;recruit a friend&quot;-bonus), and even without heirlooms and guild bonusses you can level fast. I don't get it. Every game (I remember some browsergames which work like this, and also some mmorpg's) has got some bonusses, but the game itself is free, and bonusses can be bought. Why does Blizzard think that they can't do it also? I would be happier if the game would be free to play because imo these new features are.. awful. But it'll be like told, so it seems Blizzard will loose many players who think like me. It's a pity.<br />
<br />
I was told before some minutes (we discussed the in-game store and the p2w-thing) that Blizzard is just now milking their game. WoW is just a cash cow. Again a pity.</div></div><hr />

no shit, is this actually news to anyone? 8 years and how long did it take you to figure out?<br />
<br />
it's funny because the EXACT same argument was made like 2 weeks ago about mage specs, look at every single 3 dps spec class across the board and they all share huge similarities. who would've thunk?</div></div><hr />
