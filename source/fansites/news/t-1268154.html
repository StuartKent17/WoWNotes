(Err 5.2, not that you can tell!) I haven't talked to a single person who has played 5.2 PTR and doesnt think rogues going live like that is reasonable. Even the rogues I talk to hate it because it turns their class into an autowin joke. Between the ability to teleport cheapshot the entire other team, or the ability to do 25k dps on cloth from range, it's just a joke. <br />

Yeah...glad my warrior is 85. I'll be switching to him for the remainder of this expansion probably. Even though most classes had nerfs, it just seems to me blizz wants people to play unholy more. I was unholy through wrath, but a lot has changed since then...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you please read the patch notes: it is a buff; this is only a nerf to the buff, because dk damage was too high with the recend additions: so in the end it is a buff, they simply reduced the buff a little bit.<br />
<br />
The next question is if even the buff was even neccesary when other classes have more serious problems, but this is another story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This nerf was neccesary because GoSac was simply overpowered; GoSac should be an option, not the standard,<br />
Also warlock is a pet class, sacrifice should be a solution for player who hates pet management; but it should NEVER do more damage without pet; instead Grimoire of Sacrifice should life up his name: you should Sacrifice some DPS to get rid of your pet; but player who manage their pets should make more dps.</div></div><hr />

Translation: Blizz, DK was finally Overpowered and now you are balancing them back in line: NERDRAGE!!!<br />
<br />
DK is fine on life, and it is even more fine with the smaller buffed values of the PTR; only unholy is on live a little bit behind.<br />
<br />
So instead of complaining that your buffs are smaller, other classes have much bigger problems: Shadow Priests, Balance Druids and other specs are in a much bigger pinch!</div></div><hr />

Nop, not even close. What about: Blizz, what about fixing the real problems DK's have, the survivability. Instead of pretending to give them a buff for some days to make them happy, then take it all away again. And no, dks aint fine on live, not even close to fine. Shadow priests and troubles in the same sentence? Seriously?</div></div><hr />

That's as it may be, it doesn't remove the fact that demo risks becoming the spec to go simply because they benefit so much more from the other talents in that tree.</div></div><hr />

I talk about PvE-Damage, not about this bonus-thing called PvP in this game. And yes, in PvP shadow have massive problems. Also if you talk about PvP, why do you nerdrage about this changes, they affect PvP not very much. But you don't complain about PvP before, you went nerdrage because of some DPS-Reduction that affect PvP not very much.<br />
<br />
And yes, in PvE Dk is fine on live, PvP is another chapter, there dks could really have some improvements<br />
But again in PvE dk are in a much better place than shadows, who really are at the bottom now, and because of our poor scaling with secondary stats it will get much worse.</div></div><hr />

If you ever pvp'ed, you would know that dps is about everything now. Its all tsg. Oh, and ye, you would be surpised about how many who actually do pvp. So stop calling it a &quot;bonus-thing&quot;, cuz its far from that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is true, but demo should benefit much more from the talents there, because demo is the pet-spec for warlocks. If the damage of the other specs is too low then they should be adjusted, but this fix is not in the right place in GoSac.<br />

<br />
Maybe, but mostly the game is about PvE, and it sucks that because of some problems in PvP classes are gutted in PvE because of them (as it is on shadow priests) If blizzard would give for example spriests some PvE-Glyphs that increase our dps and remove some PvP-Abilities and burst, this could be a solution.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluminum</div><div class="date">2013-02-25, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rapid PTR changes in opposite directions are clear sign they don't know WTF they are doing.<br />
<br />
They INCREASE an ability by 10% then a few days later DECREASE from the original value by 5%. Adjusting the amount of increase is one thing, but changing directions means they don't really understand their own mechanics. Clearly something highlighted a need to help, now all of a sudden it was too powerful to begin with? bullcrap<br />
<br />
While we're at it, the constant refusal to release a true model of the games dps engine while saying out of the other corner of their mouth that community derived dps from countless ingame tests don't count is a BIG FAT JOKE.</div></div><hr />

DK's got an across the board buff, albeit the first round of buffs they got were too large. <br />
<br />
See- live frost DK dps is fine, unholy is a little weak<br />
<br />
THEY TEST (GET IT TEST REALM) buffs on DK, see the numbers are a little high, and bring them down.<br />
<br />
Its still a buff. Also reading some of these posts (wall of text with so many run on sentences about quitting) makes me lose faith in humanity.</div></div><hr />

How about this? let's make that warriors can only wield umbrellas ? Also wouldn't it be cool if they can only wear pretty dresses and can only mount ponies?<br />

Maybe it's just my own frustration with the fact that in my own opinion playing fury has become boring as hell. All you do is basicly stare at your enrage, it's not fun and always it's not even manageable.<br />
<br />
I still have high hopes that the new tier and patch will even give us a break with it, but the ppm for the setbonus was just... baaaaaaad. :(</div></div><hr />

GoSac is the best option? Ok, but why not improve the pets rather than nerf GoSac? The bloodfear is too good or the other tier 4 talents are crap? I'm surprised they have not nerfed the Kil'jaeden's Cunning too.<br />
I stopped playing wow for 1,5 year due to constant nerfs and changes (for the worse) in our class and I'm getting bored again.<br />
5.2 will be bad for our class in pvp and pve, but it seems that the GC is loving the changes. Incidentally, since the Burning Crusade our class can not spend 3 months without a nerf or any radical change that forces us to play with a spec, then another, then another, etc ... This sucks!<br />

im sure they nerf and buff everything based on how many people play the class just to keep the majority of players who play x class subscribed<br />
I agree 100% with you.</div></div><hr />
