Blue posts<br />
Blizzcon Ticket Sales<br />
No dates for ticket sales as of yet. We'll be doing our best to allow for plenty of time to purchase and make your arrangements to come though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16137078813-blizzcon-dates.html))<br />
<br />
Splitting official roles forums in PvP/PvE sub-forums<br />
We have to consider the ramifications that a change to one aspect of the game has on the other, so as long as you want to participate in class mechanics discussions, you need to do the same.<br />
<br />
Part of the motivation for pooling multiple classes into one role forum is so players would have to actually defend their claims in an audience that consisted of more than just their own class cheering for any calls for buffs. The same is true of PvE vs. PvP. Our concern is that if we had a PvE only forum, players would say things like &quot;Just change this ability. I don't care if it ruins PvP because I hate PvP,&quot; and then chasing anyone out of the forum who defended PvP because &quot;This is the PvE forum! Go away!&quot; <br />
<br />
We realize the discussions in the role forums can be heated, because to some extent we are inviting players to disagree on complex topics or defend their own class in the face of &quot;Nerf the OP class&quot; calls. We'll try to keep the actual trolls at bay. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137529134-new-damage-dealing-forum-plz.html))<br />

Achievements<br />
Algalon Achievements Title Rewards (Link (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=850))<br />
There are some changes planned to how these achievements will work/be worded, not sure when the changes will happen though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/16137229284-algalon-achievements.html))<br />
<br />
Removing the Immortal achievement from Glory of the Raider<br />
No plans to do this at this time. The &quot;immortal&quot; style achievement from Ulduar has changed a bit, but that is part of a new/separate meta-achievement. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/16137219441-removal-of-immortal-from-gotr.html))<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Algalon feeds on your tears<br />
I may regret saying this, but it is hard. If Sarth +3 was too much for you, then you probably want to steer clear of the hard modes and Mr. Algalon. The achievement is called &quot;He feeds on your tears&quot; for a reason. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14637425299-25-man-raids-more-difficult-false-assumption.html))<br />
<br />
Sartharion Speed Kills (See this news (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=47540.0))<br />
Those speed kills are normally the kind of thing we would fix in some way or another because those cross the line in our opinion. It's a subjective line though, and we don't always want to stomp on every creative solution that players come up with. In this case, so many groups already had Sarth on farm and the solution would have involved hitting group dps pretty severely that a quick fix didn't feel warranted. If say that was the solution that players came up with to deal with Algalon within the time-frame where only a guild or so per server had beaten him, then we'd probably have been more reactive. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14637425299-25-man-raids-more-difficult-false-assumption.html))<br />
<br />
10-Man raiding in Ulduar<br />
There are groups of players who just prefer to run smaller raids. I don't know off the top of my head how many, if any, exist on your server. They do exist. You can't always assume they are small guilds. Sometimes they are large guilds of more casual players with only a few raiders. It varies. What happened in LK is a lot of these players (who remember prefered to do 10-player content) just gave up and joined 25-player pugs because those were easier and provided better loot. For Ulduar, we predict they will have more motivation to do the 10-player version because the 25-player version is going to be more challenging. They might join a pug, wipe a lot, and remember why they prefer to run smaller raids with friends. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14637425299-25-man-raids-more-difficult-false-assumption.html))<br />
<br />
Raid stacking<br />
Raid stacking is not a strategy at all we want to prop up. However it's tricky. At some point if you take steps to prohibit raid stacking, then what you are really doing is saying: you will be punished for taking more than 1 of each spec or whatever, and at that point you are limiting flexibility just as much as if you were encouraging raid stacking. We want you to be able to take your friends (or at least the people you want to raid with even if you're uber hardcore and don't care if they're your friends or not). We don't want you to have to kick loyal and skilled players just because Jimmy the idiot shaman / paladin / DK / whatever brings better buffs or utility for that fight.<br />
<br />
Now some groups will swap out players for each boss. That's just what they do. The same guilds might respec or regem for every boss, and there are even cases of groups that picked up Leatherworking for drums with the frequency most sane people would change specs. I'm not exaggerating. Again, we aren't going to come down hard on groups that do this. We just don't want it to be the only way you feel you can experience the hard mode content. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14637425299-25-man-raids-more-difficult-false-assumption.html))<br />
<br />
Resistance-based encounters and farming<br />
Resistance fights are still around in a way (Sapphiron). We wanted to get away from the necessity of making a gear set to make any decent attempt at a boss and instead focus more on the encounter itself challenging players and not a resistance cap being the challenge. While putting the frost resistance on for Sapphiron helps, especially early on when progression through the dungeon, we didn't want it to be 100% needed in all attempts.<br />
<br />
And before you say it, yeah yeah, Sapphiron/Naxx wasn't hard, but we like this design layout better than the bag stuffing necessity version that was Huhuran. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16137369221-bring-back-resistence-fights.html))<br />
<br />
[...] We have made a number of changes in the preparation area that minimize the need to farm for additional consumable buffs. Farming mats for several days outside of raid days wasn't really fun for anybody (to my knowledge), and it forced us to design the encounters around having those buffs so if you didn't farm the mats you were in a tough position. It is possible we will add more Sapphiron-like resistance fights in the future where it helps to have the pieces, but the pieces will likely be more like the current frost resist pieces instead of an entire set of random &quot;garbage&quot; pieces that you keep in your bank for a year.<br />
<br />
I will admit you are one of the first people I have heard about enjoying farming all the random pieces of resist gear from the old fights, but if you feel the raiding is being too easy, we have covered that in how Naxx was meant to be accessible but we probably made it too easy overall and want to change that a bit in Ulduar.<br />
<br />
[...] It tends to not be a lot of fun when players' have to have their stats all nerfed a bunch just to be able to survive an attempt in a resistance fight. We would rather avoid a situation like this and make it so the encounter itself is what is challenging. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16137369221-bring-back-resistence-fights.html))<br />
<br />
Engineering<br />
Engineering &quot;10-second DPS burst&quot; cooldown<br />
We took a look at some of the Engineering items and generally speaking we believe you need to be able to couple “on use” items with your own abilities, otherwise they have to be better than your normal abilities to ever be worth the GCD which is a direction we didn't want to go. So to keep players from stacking a whole bunch of them at once, we implemented a shared cooldown for them so you can use one of these burst items at a time, not several at once, while mixing them with your abilities for the best impact. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137368976-now-invokes-a-10second-dps-burst-item-cd.html))<br />
<br />
Hand-Mounted Pyro Rocket<br />
The plan is to take them off the GCD in 3.1 along with a damage increase and shorter cooldown (45s instead of 1 min). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137368976-now-invokes-a-10second-dps-burst-item-cd.html))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Tanking skill spamming<br />
Heroic Strike/Rune Strike/Maul - Why not just make these skills toggled? It's a stupid mechanic to have to spam a button at the speed of light. It'd work perfect too, just un-toggle it if you're starved for rage/RP <br />
Toggle is kind of a weird mechanic. It might do the job, but it's not something we do often in the game.<br />
<br />
One idea that we might explore a little more is that the threat (and damage?) done is modified by the amount of rage / runic power you have. So imagine if your bar is low, you can SPAM HS / RS / Maul for threat if you need it. But once your bar is high, you generate so much threat with a single hit that you don't need to spam it. (I'm not talking about draining the bar as in Execute.) This might also allow us to change it from a next-swing to just a normal attack (so that sometimes another button is better).<br />
<br />
This is all hand wavy stuff at this point. I'm not sure the numbers would work out correctly. It could just be that more threat is always better so that you spam HS at low rage and spam HS at high rage. That might get us more into the realm of having the cost increase, so that it uses more rage the more you have, but translates that into more threat (&quot;Heroic Execute&quot;). Aside from potential confusion about how much the ability would cost, Heroic Strike itself is extra complicated because it is used by dps warriors as well.<br />
<br />
In any case, we would like to improve how spammy and mandatory these abilities feel, but we need to find a way to fix them that still lets them do their job (transfering extra resources, which you presumably have more of when getting hit, into threat). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/16137368448-heroic-strikerune-strikemaul.html))<br />
<br />
Non-Plate healers in Arenas<br />
You mean except for the priests in RMP? Many players think Resto shamans are fine, and will be better once DKs and paladins are brought down a little. That leaves Resto druids. We didn't give them many buffs, but we gave them some, and losing JoJ's range and Blood Plague's hot removal is a huge net buff to them.

Anti-Magic Shield<br />
I'll be honest, we are trying to find the right number here that lets the ability (AMS) be useful in PvE without being OP and lets it be useful in PvP without being underpowered.<br />
<br />
If we think DKs are still able to make some boss encounters too trivial, this is likely one of the first things we will hit again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/16137368961-looking-for-clarification-on-ams-buff.html))<br />

Blessing of Sanctuary - 3.1 Clarification<br />
Blessing of Sanctuary still reduces damage taken. The change that was made was that it no longer restores rage, runic power, or energy. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/16137229622-blessing-of-sanctuary-concerns.html))<br />

Chain Lightning in 3.1<br />
We aren't changing Chain Lightning for 3.1. We originally wanted to make CL more clearly an AE spell, which meant improving the number of targets. But we think it has a decent niche as is. There are bigger fish to fry.<br />
<br />
[...] CL has a shorter cast time, so it's fun (for some shamans at least) to try and use it to fill in short gaps based on haste, procs, movement, etc. even on single targets. Being able to mix and match LB and CL the right way is one manner in which great Elementals can distinguish themselves from good Elementals.<br />
<br />
After doing some more research, confab'ing with some pro shamans, and reading lots of forum posts, we decided this was probably a sufficient niche for CL and trying to push it into a purely AE role would mean a loss of fun for some shamans. The cost didn't seem worth the beneft any longer so we scrapped the plan. You can chalk this up to an example where your feedback counted in making that call.<br />
<br />
An alternative is something like encouraging more Flame Shocks after Lava Bursts or whatever to try and make the rotation more interesting. That's not something we're going to mess with for 3.1 but might be something to consider in the future. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137188772-chain-lightnign-change-scrapped--blue-dis.html))<br />
<br />
AoE Capability and Magma Totem<br />
We think it's close enough. You have to run up and plant a totem, but then it is doing damage while you are casting something else. Totem of Wrath is a good buff, but when you're in an AE situation, the contribution of Magma totem is probably going to account for more.<br />
<br />
We aren't trying to make sure everyone does the exact same AE damage, because realistically we don't think optimizing your group or raid around maximum AE damage is worth it. We don't think most groups will say &quot;Nah, let's bring the mage, because their AE is so much better.&quot; We just don't want you to feel like a liability when the rest of the group is doing AE. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137188772-chain-lightnign-change-scrapped--blue-dis.html))<br />
<br />

Warlock vs. Mage<br />
I think the OPs original point about how close the mage and warlock are in the design space (down to using similar gear) was the most interesting. After that the discussion kind of wandered into the same kinds of threads we have seen a lot of lately.<br />
<br />
We don't think mages are in any realistic danger of losing spots to warlocks. If we're really down in the realm of &quot;They'll bring the other guy because his debuff is easier to apply&quot; then I think there are probably other things you can do to make yourself a valuable member of your group.<br />
<br />
We don't think mages and warlocks are in any danger of losing their spots to evil hybrids. Groups that run with all hybrids are most likely going to have lower dps (though not as low as if they had brought all hybrids during BC).<br />
<br />
We think mage and warlock dps are pretty comparable. Again, close enough that things like boss, gear, skill, luck and even lag are probably going to have more of an impact on the numbers you come up with than the base numbers in the spells and talents alone.<br />
<br />
Things may work out different in Ulduar for one reason or another. Maybe players develop a new rotation that bumps their dps more than the ones currently being used. Maybe someone comes up with a glyph - trinket combo that does amazing things. Maybe the specific items that drop in Ulduar do more than the test shirts players had on the PTR. If any of that leads to what we think are bad outcomes, then we will adjust accordingly. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137189080-excessive-design-overlap-for-warlocksmages.html))<br />

Fury warrior hit rating in 3.1<br />
We do sort of like the idea of giving different melee classes and specializations different ways of building expertise, whether through talents or gear. It is something we'll be watching very closely though, particularly with regard to Fury warriors once 3.1 hits the live realms.<br />
<br />
If it ends up feeling like a lack of passive expertise in the Fury tree is causing Fury warrior DPS to suffer even when appropriately geared, we won't shy away from reevaluating the way the tree is set up. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137369207-fury-and-ret-left-out-in-the-cold.html))<br />
<br />
Warrior changes in 3.1<br />
Shattering Throw and the new Overpower mechanic are fairly significant changes. We tried to introduce them in a relatively conservative manner and if they seem to work out okay, we would consider adjusting cooldowns, cast times, etc. Overpower shouldn’t feel like an RNG proc if you get the proper talents in Arms. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137368846-really-need-that-pummel.html))<br />
<br />
Stance dancing<br />
Changing stances is a core mechanic for warriors and it isn’t our goal to let you just stay in one stance all of the time for all of your needs, especially in PvP. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137368846-really-need-that-pummel.html))<br />
<br />
Shield required to cast skills<br />
We also like requiring shields for some abilities because it sends a clear visual message to other players of your intent, example: Spell Reflect. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137368846-really-need-that-pummel.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to use attack power and melee (plate) as an example, and this is with PvE in mind.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing<br />
Personal benefit: 64 attack power in form of 2 sockets<br />
General benefit: Able to craft chest LK lock openers and best 10-man equivalent helmet and good 10-man equivalent weapons<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting<br />
Personal benefit: 66 attack power in form of 3 epic gems compared to rare gems<br />
General benefit: Able to craft good 10-man equivalent rings and necklaces, Dragon gems make socket bonuses easier to get, able to craft decent trinkets.<br />
<br />
Inscription<br />
Personal benefit: 64 attack power in form of better shoulder enchant<br />
General benefit: No need to grind Hodir rep at all, easier access to the awesome card trinkets, and currently a very easy way of making money from AH sales.<br />
<br />
Enchanting<br />
Personal benefit: 64 attack power in form of unique ring enchants<br />
General benefit: Generally better bag space as all trash items can be disenchanted.<br />
<br />
Engineering<br />
Personal benefit: Negative benefits.<br />
General benefit: Able to once per 8 hours call a mail box, able to (for a fee of 2 Saronite) call a repair and trash vendor, able to attempt a resurrect once per hour with a high fail risk.<br />
<br />
<br />
To sum engineering up: Everything you can do, there is someone who can do it better than you. <br />
Repairing? There's a repair guy outside the instance who charge 20% less. <br />
Resurrecting? You'll likely fail anyway. <br />
Mailbox? 8 hour cooldown makes this much less useful. <br />
Enchanting? Unless you're going for shits-and-giggles, every single enchant (aka tinker) is strictly worse than what an Enchanter can put on your item.<br />
Goggles? Your local Blacksmith/Leatherworker can provide you with a better head gear, and theirs is BOE with no profession requirement.<br />
<br />
In fact, it's so bad, that if you use the tools provided for you by the profession, you'll likely LOSE performance. In case of my exemplification, using tinkers will make you lose 15 agility - and that's not taking into account that activating the hand rocket will likely cost you further dps.<br />
<br />
P.S. There's not much surprise that everyone's JC, is there?<br />
<br />
P.P.S. The Hog isn't a benefit of the profession unless you consider enchanting &lt;random non-bop enchant&gt; to be a benefit of enchanting. The Hog can be used and bought by everyone, provided they can cough up the insane amount of gold required...</div></div><hr />

Why do they have to know what we are about to do? What about the instant Priest shield, instant CoS or instant bubble? You would think a white shield above our head would be enough but no lets go the whole way, make them require a shield, use a macro and stance dance.</div></div><hr />

Engineering glove enchant was only bad because you had to use it over some other move, now you can use it simultaneously with an instant cast move<br />
example for a ret paladin<br />
<br />
/use 10<br />
/cast Divine Storm<br />
<br />
and both spells will be used at the same time<br />
if it is a spell you use frequently this is no different than 110 ap, just in more bursty format.<br />
one Might say it is better than a passive effect because you control when it happens, on short fights with time inbetween fights this will be more valuable. On boss fights using this on its 45s cooldown with one of your instant moves will be very good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fact: Enchant Gloves - Crusher gives me 21 DPS at my current gear setup.<br />
Fact: The perks of Leatherworking, Blacksmithing, Enchanting, Inscription, or Alchemy give me 51 DPS at my current gear setup without removing that 21 DPS.<br />
Fact: Given the mechanics behind the new rockets (10% crit rate, 1.5x crit damage), over infinite time, the rockets provide an average of 41 DPS that removes the 21 DPS from Enchant Gloves - Crusher, meaning they grant me 20 DPS.<br />
Fact: The fact that the Rockets will place a 10-second cooldown on any DPS-boosting on-use trinket when used will lower the average DPS due to having to hesitate rocket firing so as not to miss a cooldown call and be unable to activate trinkets.<br />
Fact: The fact that any on-use trinkets will place a 20-second cooldown on the rockets will further lower their DPS contribution.<br />
Fact: The above facts, combined together, form the conclusion that Engineering is about a 40 DPS downgrade from Inscription, Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, Enchanting, or Alchemy, and over 65 DPS lower than Jewelcrafting.<br />
<br />
That is COMPLETELY unacceptable.</div></div><hr />

except that 14 ap is 1 dps. 45 second cooldown on 1500+ damage that has no global is very desirable technically you do ~1500 more dps when you have it off cooldown. Also keep in mind that not everyone is a hunter. First of all I'm sure Blizzard knows how to balance their professions. Jewelcrafting owns right now but will be weaker with the rise of epic gems. Jewelcrafting/Engineering are my profession choices and I even chose to drop 450 enchanting for 441 engineering (got it there in a couple hours and 1500 gold as a gnome). The trinkets from Kewelcrafting are not at all useful for a physical dps class. The prismatic gems on the other hand I like those a lot. :) You're really just overdramaticizing what isn't a big deal. The extra dps could be made up by anything, you don't have to go hard crazy on min-maxing. You're part of a group after all.</div></div><hr />

You can't state that making 1000g an hour with mining an Engineering is a fact. Your never guranteed a fixed income no matter which server your on. It also doesn't help much that their not willing to make fun gadgets again and just leave you with osme of the most useless relics one can craft from a profession. Tinkering is great don't get me wrong I wish it could stack on enchants so atleast we have an edge in certain situations.</div></div><hr />

I know how to compute DPS, thank you very much.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
45 second cooldown on 1500+ damage that has no global is very desirable technically you do ~1500 more dps when you have it off cooldownAverage of 1600-ish damage divided by 45 seconds = 35.555~ * 1.15 (10% crit rate and 1.5x damage mod) = 40.888~ DPS which is close enough to 41. 41 - 21 = 20.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that not everyone is a hunter.Granted. But casters have Spellpower enchants, to which the rockets cannot compare (the math has been done), and tanks have Armsman or Expertise (depending on desire for threat or avoidance).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all I'm sure Blizzard knows how to balance their professions. Jewelcrafting owns right now but will be weaker with the rise of epic gems.If they knew how, they would have done it already, and Jewelcrafting will still be the strongest profession in the game even WITH epic gems thanks to the prismatic nature of Dragon's Eyes. Not having to sacrifice 1-2 sockets for off-color gems and being able to access hard socket bonuses gives way more than the 4 itemization points per gem that epic gems will bring.<br />
<br />
Please do some math and analytics before spouting off at the mouth. The rocket &quot;buff&quot; does effectively nothing to make Engineering raid-capable. It is still atrocious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, it requires 350 engineering to use, so once you drop engineering you won't be able to use the mount unless you relevel engineering once again.<br />
<br />
Personally, the roflcopters and outland teleporter are the only real things I'm going to miss about the profession when I drop it in 3.1 (after getting a Pet Bombling schematic out of gnomer and making it). Engineering was fun back in vanilla WoW and to a much lesser extent, TBC. Nowadays it's a freaking waste of time with little to no new fun or PvE usage... :-\</div></div><hr />

No, it's not. You chose Engineering, whether because it was useful at the time, you liked the ideas behind it, or you just didn't do any research and chose it. It seems yourself and every other vocal Engineer thinks they need Blizzard to give their profession something that equals the numerical benefits of other professions. Cry more.<br />
<br />
Those gains that other professions have is something that only a min-maxer would notice. And if you're interested in that, you either wouldn't go with Engineering or would have dropped it already for Jewelcrafting or whatever else is good for your class. I recently dropped Herbalism for Jewelcrafting, reaching 375 in a day and for only ~1500g completely through the Auctionhouse.<br />
<br />
It's fine to be angry that you spent time and money on a crafting profession only to be let done statistically. But don't assume Blizzard needs to &quot;fix&quot; it due to your own lack of foresight. There might be a time where Engineering benefits your class in the way you want it to, but now is not that time. And all the complaining in the world won't make it come any faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would agree with this. I am pretty pleased with engineering overall - having picked it up solely for thorium grenades - and I know several of my guildies are as they've recently leveled it. None of us are min-maxers with professions and we all enjoy aerial assaults from Lumbermill and fistfuls of frost grenades in pvp.<br />
<br />
While a lot of the tinkers are badly balanced against replacing enchants, they're a huge step forward in that you're no longer wearing green items with virtually no stats for the same effect. The rocket gloves are pretty bad for pve sustained dps, but they're good pvp burst - and the real draw is that you can get that sort of thing regardless of spec.<br />
<br />
Utility is a hard thing to balance properly, especially when it's available to every spec in the game, so I'm not surprised that on paper engineering is comparatively worse-off for pve. Unless they radically change the intent of the profession then it always will be.</div></div><hr />

Fact: You are talking out your ass. While it is true that engineering provides less DPS then other professions in exchange for utility enchants/trinkets, your math and the magnitude of the difference is woefully inept.<br />
<br />
If Enchanting gives you a 51dps increase via ring enchants (64ap) for a total of .79dps per ap, how is Crusher (44ap) giving you 21dps for a total of .47dps per ap? If those engineering rockets give you 41 dps for a net gain of 20, that would imply the dps difference between enchanting and engineering is 31, not 40. <br />
<br />
You chose engineering for all the trinkets, gadgets, bombs, et cetera. If you want the same level of dps, you'd have to give all that up. And if you did, wtf is the point of having different professions in the first place? Not every profession is as good for every class, you'll just have to live with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Utility? For real? I suppose the only ulduar drop for engineer which is a flashlight schem for a level 49 gadget with a 1 hr cooldown is utility to you? Or how about those nifty bombs that do less reliable damage than my normal attacks? The fun items in engineering were nerfed long ago with &quot;Will not work beyond level 60&quot; restrictions. If that hasn't gutted the majority of the profession, then arena surely has. Most items that we can make are being nerfed to hell for &quot;balance&quot; but nothing is done to &quot;profession only&quot; enchants that give exceptional bonuses vs normal means (jc only gems, bs only prismatics etc). Oh yeah, thats balance.<br />
<br />
The gyrocopter is cool, that's out of the way. Hmm, What else? A bike I'll never afford? One would assume engineering has its benefits, but who would take them if other professions can easily surpass them? (I'm looking at you, tinkers). The mote extractor is nigh-useless because a simple run with mining will yield many more eternals than searching for rare gas clouds ever will.<br />
<br />
Regarding the &quot;professions aren't for everyone&quot; uh.. all professions provide something for all classes to use. Enchants, although individually are situational, come in a wide variety of flavors so that as a whole, the profession can fit everyone's needs.Even blacksmiths can get free jewel slots even though most of BS is composed of plate and weapons that only a few classes can use. Not to mention they can be sold for profit. Most engineer items have &quot;requires engineering&quot; or can be supplemented quite easily by a pve item. That sweet epic gun we can make? Equivalent to the drake mounted crossbow, if not slightly worse. Those helms we make are replaced quite early on in Naxx, and not even by tier items. Blacksmiths get new patterns to make even better belts/boots while we get what? a flashlight? we fight robots and mechs for flashlights on a 1 hr cooldown while ALCHEMY recipies drop?!? The gripes with engineering would be much quieter if the tinkers were placed on items that cannot currently be modified or enchanted. That way, no one has to give anything up for them nor do they have to take a lesser version of a pre-existing enchant + a gimmick ability.<br />
<br />
Your attitude regarding &quot;you can't have this if you have that&quot; is quite old. Its reminiscent of those who did not want hybrids to do comparable dps to &quot;pures&quot; because they **can** do other things. Honestly, ask yourself if you would trade 22 agility enchants to cloak for 10 agility and a parachute? Not even engineers would; the gains from engineering tinkers are not even worth it and highly situational. Better question: if you really believe engineering to not be that bad, would you drop your current profession now and max engineering out? No? Okay then, please go have fun on your JC and stop trying to keep other people down.</div></div><hr />

Fact 1: Mining and Engineering will lose you over 90 dps compared to if you chose Jewelcrafting and Blacksmithing<br />

First, those new engineering items are from the trainer, so good job starting off your post well. Those nifty bombs are still useful in battlegrounds, world pvp, and for kiting mobs. The cost is high, but they remain powerful and useful nevertheless. The associated damage isn't staggering, however. All those pre-BC trinkets were nerfed because no trinket should be that powerful in arena as to change the outcome without involving some semblence of skill. The MC cap in 2v2 would be retardly OP, and you know it. All professions give some benefit in arena. Engineering has slightly better burst with the trinket and this glove enchant. <br />
<br />
<br />
The gyrocopter is cool, that's out of the way. Hmm, What else? A bike I'll never afford? <br />
Whether or not you find it hard to make a gyrocopter or a bike doesn't make them any less interesting. Mote extractor is fine; if you don't like anything about being an engineer, why the hell are you one?<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding the &quot;professions aren't for everyone&quot; uh.. all professions provide something for all classes to use. <br />
No kidding. my words were &quot;Not every profession is as good for every class,&quot; Notice the bold. AP from an extra socket or ring enchants or fur lining will benefit some classes more than others. A feral druid would rather have had sockets for strength, as i'm sure a DK would prefer the strength as well. The JC trinket is retardedly good for a tank, maybe too much so. JC is too beneficial in comparison to other professions and should be brought down in line. A caster probably benefits more from engineering than other classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most engineer items have &quot;requires engineering&quot; or can be supplemented quite easily by a pve item. <br />
EVERY PROFESSION crafts epic quality items that are inferior to PVE acquired gear. That is the new design philosophy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your attitude regarding &quot;you can't have this if you have that&quot; is quite old. Its reminiscent of those who did not want hybrids to do comparable dps to &quot;pures&quot; because they **can** do other things. <br />
My main is a feral druid who has LW and enchanting as a profession. Your failure here is legendary. I expect my dps to have a slightly lower top end because of the design of the game, although I expect my dps to be competitive in similar gear. I can't count the number of times I've saved wipes by going bear and picking up the boss/adds temporarily, or using Rebirth on someone, or how many times tanks (and myself) have survived due to an improved LotP proc. <br />
<br />
The benefits to feral DPS from LW and enchanting are smaller than BS or JC would give me, yet you don't see me with my tit in a ringer like you. I'm not out to get anyone; the quoted poster lied, and his math is terrible. I called him out on it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bbr</div><div class="date">2009-04-12, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously, how the hell do people still say it's fair that engineering gets &quot;utility&quot; to compensate for the lack of stuff that other professions get?<br />
There's a HUGE difference in one profession being better than the next, and simply flat out MUCH WORSE.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing gives you 2 sockets, under the current gem options that means 2x 16 &quot;stats&quot; of any choice.<br />
<br />
Enchanting gives 2 ring enchants, each 32 AP = 2x 16 stats.<br />
<br />
Skinning gives 32 crit rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now the difference you'll notice here, is that even though each of those professions gets +32 stats, 32 crit rating will be worse than 64 AP for some classes. Namely AEP or EP converted, you'd be better off with the Attack Power. <br />
However, they all still have 32 Stat points worth of bonus for their profession.<br />
<br />
Tailors get &quot;utility&quot; in the form of finding more cloth. woo.<br />
Alchemists get &quot;utility&quot; in the form of double crafts.<br />
Engineers get &quot;utility&quot; in the form bombs that do less damage than our regular aoe, a flash light wooptidoo, being able to craft a flying machine that's as fast as regular mounts so doesn't matter shit, able to craft vanity pets that don't do anything in pvp or pve, and several items that cant even be used in the arena anyway, and the list goes on.<br />
<br />
Skinners, miners and herbalists get &quot;utility&quot; in the form of being able to gather materials from resource nodes.<br />
<br />
Even mining gets 500 health, which translates into ~31 stats. While that's useless for a dps player, it's great for a tank.<br />
<br />
Engineering gets nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
This isn't about which profession is better, this is about fairness and equality.<br />
Currently it's NOT equal, since every profession gets +~32 stats bonus in some form or other while engineering gets N O T H I N G worth mentioning. <br />
<br />
Don't even bother saying &quot;but you got hand mounted rockets, trinkets, boot enchant, cloak enchant, haste glove enchant&quot;.... ALL of those are WORSE than regular enchants that would replace them. Each and every single one of them is crap.</div></div><hr />

Then drop engineering. If the benefits of that profession are not good for you/your class, then drop it and pick up one that is useful. Since those statistics are starting to sound like life and death for you, it'll probably be easiest to just pick up a new profession.<br />
<br />
Blizzard isn't going to make you like Engineering any time soon, and it's not Blizzard's fault you chose Engineering in the first place. Get over it and just move on.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Psykhe</div><div class="date">2009-04-12, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then drop engineering. If the benefits of that profession are not good for you/your class, then drop it and pick up one that is useful.<br />
<br />
Exept that Blizzards design goal is to make all professions equal in the benefit they give. That is the whole reason they removed strong profession based BOP epics, for instance.<br />
So if blizzard fail to make a profession equal it is very much &quot;their fault&quot;. If they do so they fail their own design goal.<br />
<br />
<br />
That being said, I am not that sure that eng is that imbalanced anymore. The 41 dps benefit from the rocket glove enchant calculation posted here fits.<br />
<br />
The claim that the other profession bonuses give you 51 dps worth however doesn't. If you take the standart 64 AP bonus you get 64/14 -&gt; 4.6 more weapon dps from that.<br />
Now, you obviously get a bigger total dps boost than only that since you also use that AP for special attacks and (for some classes) pets, which likely doubles the effective dps boost. Possibly even triples it. Maaaaaaybe quadruples it.<br />
<br />
But...an ELEVEN times bigger effective dps boost (which would be needed to reach 51 dps)? No. Fu**ing. Way.<br />
<br />
<br />
From the glove enchants only eng does not seem to bad compared to the other professions. <br />
The other tinkers are of cource rather pointless for PvE. And anyone who even tries to argue that the eng bombs are useful (as in: worth the gold) in non-arena PvP needs his/her head examined.</div></div><hr />

Here's a tip, don't try and assume Blizzard's policies. I believe they've said Engineering is right where they want it. So while we can run all the statistics on why it isn't equal, Blizzard isn't going to care. And it only bogs down forums and comment boxes with the same crap over and over.<br />
<br />
Regardless, as yourself and others have shown, Engineering can be &quot;equal&quot; in ways that's purely non-statistical. Yes this doesn't benefit everyone, but it does benefit people who can care less about their Character Sheet quite a bit. Hence why the people who picked up Engineering and expect it to give them x amount of statistics fail from their own lack of foresight and selfish wants.</div></div><hr />

Instead of a compilation of past changes already posted here, I think we have something new today. I didn't really do reagents change lately because of tons of reasons but they are now back on the site! A lot of professions had the reagents requirements of low-level recipes lowered or changed to match the latest changes in the game. (Drops from &quot;old&quot; dungeons removed, etc ...) <br />
When it says removed does that mean removed from the dungeon and available else where (trainer/world/mob drop) or removed from the entire game never to be seen again (and those who have the pattern already may or may not losing the ability to create it)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because while I 'give up' pve performance, I gain roots, slowfalls, speed boosts and burst damage in pvp that, as a resto shaman, I have no other way to access. And yeah, most of those are useless in arena, but they shine in bgs and world pvp.<br />
(Yes, the bombs are useful - though if you're using any bombs other than Frost Grenades, you're an idiot)<br />
<br />
Yes, they're crap in pve. Engineering has traditionally been crap in pve. The only reason this is even a topic is because of a) all the people who fotm rolled engineering for goggles in BC and now feel like they're owed something for it and b) because arena is now &quot;the&quot; pvp venue and most of the benefits of the profession are useless there due to cooldowns/consumable restrictions so a lot feel it's useless in pvp too.<br />
<br />
Tinkers are worse than the enchants but, again, they were terrible in BC and Vanilla where if you wanted a parachute you wore a level 40 green instead of your epic pvp cloak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't like what Engineering has to offer, DON'T ROLL IT. It's pretty obvious if you've ever had engineering that it's completely PVP. Look at it's traditional roll: bombs, funky head/trinket/boot items, parachute cloak.<br />
<br />
It screams PVP, and that's why I've had 4 different twinks with Engineering in the past. You should level professions for a reason, not because you want +32 SP or +64 AP. If engineering was on par with other professions &quot;passive stat wise,&quot; who the fuck would roll anything else?<br />
<br />
Everyone that rolled Engi for the helm or otherwise just wants the passive stats so their prof can be the most desired when coupled with all the other perks of their prof.<br />
<br />
I say QQ more. It's great for certain people, it shouldn't be a &quot;go to&quot; profession for every character in WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
all i gotta say is gogo rocket boots. And although it's being nerfed, the lightning gen is awesome too. I play a priest an escape mechanic is always good...especially if you have a pally on your team who can freedom you. I've used rocket boots and escaped with less than 100 hp, healed up, and turned around the game and won. Enchanting has 48 stamina you can enchant on your ring, tailoring has 300 mana every once in awhile, blacksmithing lets you get a bit of stam or resil, as does jc. there are 0 other professions that give you an escape mechanic or something that can turn the game around. Sure there is a possibility that the extra 500-ish hp or extra resil will win a game for you, but it's far more common that rocket boots will save you. Not to mention being able to use them offensively (rocket boots-&gt;fear a target at a critical time)</div></div><hr />
