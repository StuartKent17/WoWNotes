Legion - Vol'jin<br />
We found some interesting references to a conversation involving Vol'jin. Unfortunately there isn't much more than what is below yet. Keep in mind that this is just a reference in an alpha build of Legion, not something final or officially announced. Spoilers below!<br />
<br />
When de time comes, you be ready to fight?<br />
If dis only de beginning, ain't gonna be easy. If we fight, everyone gonna be makin' sacrifices.<br />
Vol'jin...<br />
All your instinct be true. Innocent lives be valued, indeed, but dem magics... Demons we ain't been seein' before. I be fearin' dis only be de beginnin'.<br />
Warchief, I understand, but we cannot afford to send everything we have at the Legion. Some of our people are not ready for a war. It is -<br />
It is unfortunate... for all of us, but the time has come to defend our people - all of our people.<br />
Good. Now we all be seein'... united as one, but we also be need'n an old knowledge. Someone who understand dem fel magics from long ago. Someone ta help understand de fight dey be bringin. Helpin' us prepare... for war.<br />
Warchief, even with the might of the Horde behind us, the Legion's power continues to grow. We know neither their numbers nor their true power, but as you said, we know their intentions.<br />
Yes... and we ain't gone be fightin' de Legion alone. It be time we be reachin' out. I be goin' to visit an old friend.<br />
Dem serious times. Tell your people it's time to be gettin' ready. Everybody gettin' ready.<br />
And what of my guards, Warchief? We cannot afford to leave the city in its state. The Legion is threat enough, and the Alliance - the Alliance will surely strike when our guard is down.<br />
Leave 'em. Dem guards be remindin' us of those we lost. They be remindin' us we be one Horde. And dey be remindin' us - ain't nobody be sittin' down when war be upon us.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Character / Items<br />
We have some special-handling in mind for sheathing for things like the fist weapons. They won't be invisible <br />
Please tell me this hasnt been cut <br />
Not cut, still in progress. You will see all artifacts during normal play. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/684939445347303424))<br />
Temporarily next alpha build it will not be sheathable at all, which is not the final solution. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/684939621197676546))<br />
<br />
Transmogrification<br />
Will we be able to transmog our Artifacts? The artifacts for fury warrior don't really fit my current transmog.<br />
Yes. You will be able to transmogrify your artifacts within the confines of the existing transmog weapon rules. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/685215070675013632))<br />
Will this include transmogging from one artifact to another, I.E. Titanstrike to the bow IF you have the appearances unlocked?<br />
No. Artifact appearances are NOT available as transmogrification options for other weapons or artifacts. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/685221485904961537))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
&quot;Entitlement risk&quot; is a bizarre phrase to use for non-RNG (the lack of RNG undermining the concept of &quot;risk&quot;).<br />
Yeah I hesitated to use it but it Twitter isn't great for nuance. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685193226416861184))<br />
&quot;Entitlement&quot; can carry connotations for being a spoiled brat, which isn't at all the context I intended. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685193443824422912))<br />
But when a reward is not very RNG or too tied to very high skill, you can cause players to expect they WILL earn it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685193893919342592))<br />
Extreme case: play 10,000 games to win something. The intention may be that makes the reward rare. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685194060261269504))<br />
Bit the reality may be that you strongly encourage many players to go engage in something that really isn't that fun. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685194265555648512))<br />
By contrast most players won't farm a 0.001% drop chance. They don't have the expectation that they WILL get the item. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685194490643021827))<br />
Why is it bad to be able to work reliably toward a goal?<br />
Actual skill challenge or RNG make things rare. Long grinds can make players hate their lives (and you). (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685218152087605248))<br />
The goal may be for a small percent of players to achieve a goal or reward, which is also fine. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685217191231262720))<br />
The risk is if devs naively say &quot;We will make this rare by making it super grindy.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685217630651715584))<br />
Long term achievable goals can be fun but excessive length to promote scarcity usually doesn't feel good. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685217895186481152))<br />
<br />
Hey GC, what are your thoughts as a Dev on SWTORs level-sync system? Frankly, I LOVE it. I can play any &quot;zone&quot; at any level!<br />
The risk of level sync is if players feel no sense of accomplishment. &quot;Oh, I am level 15 now but so are those rats.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685248572246200321))<br />
Not saying SWTOR has this problem and it's not an Achilles' heel problem, just a consideration. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685248774067781632))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month<br />
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/january/ssdgraph.gif) are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. New GPUs may be coming towards the middle of this year<br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L7UZMAK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00L7UZMAK). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 6700K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date. Don't forget to visit the Computer Forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/290-Computer) for any extra questions!<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure who he could be talking to, but I'm thinking he's going to meet with King Rastakhan to try and bring the Zandalari empire on their side. The Zandalari may be pissed that they don't have a home anymore, their old kingdoms are in ruins and that we've defeated their attempts to gain back power more than a few times now, but I'm sure they'd rather live to be angry another day rather than sit back and let the Legion kill us all</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am almost sure that he talks to the Sylvanas. Whoever it is, says: <br />
And what of my guards, Warchief? We cannot afford to leave the city in its state. The Legion is threat enough, and the Alliance - the Alliance will surely strike when our guard is down.<br />
<br />
I don't see why Alliance would want to strike at Silvermoon, so it must be Undercity and thus, Sylvanas.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it makes sense, in the end, she's the one who end up appointed as Warchief, so who else would be better to mention his plan to, but his temporal replacement</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it also looks like that he really is reaching to Zandalari - becuase who else?<br />
<br />
That could be possible, i personally think is Sylvanas cause:<br />
<br />
1- She's the new warchief, it makes sense to explain what the fuck he's doing to her<br />
<br />
2- She called him first Vol'jin, and it makes sense that Sylvanas didn't adressed him by his title (cause she is not that much of a fan of having a Troll as her Warchief, but still knows how to compose herself, even more in times when eternal damnation is waiting for her)<br />
<br />
Note: Is true that it makes sense that he's talking with Saurfang or Eitrigg (i think Saurfang is the chief of the guards of Orgrimmar)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its hardly &quot; conquered &quot; when the horde was still inside.What you are asking is &quot; the same alliance that didnt backstab the rebels they fought side by side&quot;<br />
<br />
And why exactly should they get payment to repair stormwind?The current horde didnt touch during wow's history.Or is the horde supposed to pay on behalf of deathwing?<br />
<br />
This logic....</div></div><hr />

Maybe Vol'Jin needs to be dead. You know. To speak with the Loa. Maybe he will be seeking help for us.</div></div><hr />

Oh, you're right. I read it wrong due to late hour. Ye, it is most likely Sylvie.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">A Chozo</div><div class="date">2016-01-11, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding Vol'jin:<br />
<br />
I think he didnt went for King Rastakhan exactly, but more probably Prophet Zul or . Rastakhan is sitting in his sinking throne - most of the Zandalari follow Zul's guidance. He's the one with the army now (well, was, he sent most of his stuff to Lei Shen, and lost the bet).<br />
<br />
I could also say that he went for his Shado-pan trainers. Monk training saved his life against a Zandalari Troll Leader who remembers him from the meeting of 4.1. Maybe the Shado-pan are a safe bet, unlike... the Zandalari, who probablywill ask something in return for their aid.</div></div><hr />

I assume its something about her not wanting to rule from Orgrimmar or something along that line, she wants her kingdom secure.</div></div><hr />

Well... she does worry about the Blood Elves at least, i mean... they got in the Horde thanks to her.<br />
<br />
Note: Also... the Horde, in general, is what is preventing her from being in eternal damnation, that should be enough for her to care about them :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
As ridiculous as that sounds at first, I would be on board with it. Vol'jin talking about sacrifices and all, then he makes the ultimate sacrifice by taking his life in some ceremonial suicide to commune with the Loa. As long as he stays dead and he truly does give up his life to teach us something that'll help against the legion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No the other character is definitely not a Troll, no accent in their dialogue like Vol'jin and pretty much all trolls got. Id go with most of the crowd and say it's ether Sylvanas (since yeah, if she's gonna serve as the acting Warchief and Vol'jin's got some crazy fake death scheme while I execute my grand plan thing going she kinda needs to KNOW about it to help preserve the secrecy) or a major Orc like Saurfang or Ettrig.<br />
<br />
I also suspect as most do that this scheme of his involves the Zandalari in some way, they've been around for every damn major conflict the worlds ever seen pretty much, no one has a better understanding of old magics than they do.</div></div><hr />

She doesn't worry for them at all. She openly threatened Lor'themar for not wanting to join the Horde initially, I believe it was. Something like, &quot;if you don't join the Horde, I'm pulling my forces out of the Ghostlands and you can deal with the Scourge yourself.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because he said old friend. Illidan and Vol'jin were never friends.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin will seek out Zul to help him communicate with, his old dead best friend, Zalazane. Zalazane is an old witch doctor/warlock. If not zul, bwonsamdi to talk to him. <br />
<br />
The coversation sounds 3 way. Sounds like voljin talking to thrall or baine, and the bottom half is sylvanas interjecting</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) UC is in Eastern Kingdoms closest to alliance lands + worgen threat = UC is the one that cannot be left without guards due to alliance <br />

2) Sylvanas is temporary Warchief, meaning he actually sensibly explained his plan to his replacement<br />
<br />

maaaybe LorThemar too, but I think Sylvanas<br />

Vol'jin : When de time comes, you be ready to fight?<br />
If dis only de beginning, ain't gonna be easy. If we fight, everyone gonna be makin' sacrifices.<br />
<br />
Thrall or another orc: Vol'jin... (Sylvanas hasn't called him with his name so I doubt she's talking now, so someone close to Vol'jin speaks now)<br />
<br />
Vol'jin : All your instinct be true. Innocent lives be valued, indeed, but dem magics... Demons we ain't been seein' before. I be fearin' dis only be de beginnin'.<br />
<br />
Sylvanas : Warchief, I understand, but we cannot afford to send everything we have at the Legion. Some of our people are not ready for a war. It is -<br />
It is unfortunate... for all of us, but the time has come to defend our people - all of our people.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin : Good. Now we all be seein'... united as one, but we also be need'n an old knowledge. Someone who understand dem fel magics from long ago. Someone ta help understand de fight dey be bringin. Helpin' us prepare... for war. (Sylvanas must be the earlier person because she recognized that we must be a united horde, Vol'jin says &quot;Kudos Sylvi&quot;)<br />
<br />
Sylvanas : Warchief, even with the might of the Horde behind us, the Legion's power continues to grow. We know neither their numbers nor their true power, but as you said, we know their intentions.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin : Yes... and we ain't gone be fightin' de Legion alone. It be time we be reachin' out. I be goin' to visit an old friend.<br />
Dem serious times. Tell your people it's time to be gettin' ready. Everybody gettin' ready.<br />
<br />
Sylvanas : And what of my guards, Warchief? We cannot afford to leave the city in its state. The Legion is threat enough, and the Alliance - the Alliance will surely strike when our guard is down.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin : Leave 'em. Dem guards be remindin' us of those we lost. They be remindin' us we be one Horde. And dey be remindin' us - ain't nobody be sittin' down when war be upon us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This logic....<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter that the Horde had nothing to do with Stormwind's destruction. The Alliance provided the Horde with supplies and was the main reason Garrosh could be stopped. It was a freakin' dumb move to leave Orgrimmar without ending the Horde, getting any kind of tribute or at least getting payment for their supplies.</div></div><hr />

Your theory is on point. But, only the guard part at the bottom sounds like her. <br />
&quot;Warchief, even with the might of the Horde behind us, the Legion's power continues to grow. We know neither their numbers nor their true power, but as you said, we know their intentions.&quot; Actually sounds like khadgar.<br />

Vol'jin is pulling a Big Boss!<br />

So is Vol'jin telling Sylvanas to leave her undead guards in Orgrimmar to show the new (forced) solidarity of the two halves of the Horde (Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms)? It'd be cool to get some undead elites guarding Horde cities on that side of the Maelstrom.</div></div><hr />

I think there should be a balance of both approaches. Sometimes when you grind something out for a very long time, it doesn't even matter that you get a great reward from it - you resent it for the time and sanity it took away from you. BUT there is satisfaction is working your bum off for something for a long time and being rewarded with it. <br />
<br />
At the same time, I like the random nature of RNG - even if it means I still don't have certain rare mounts, it's a really nice surprise when the look does drop. It's that excitement that you can't really replicate with a long grind. <br />

&quot;Entitlement&quot; can carry connotations for being a spoiled brat, which isn't at all the context I intended. (OccupyGStreet)<br />
But when a reward is not very RNG or too tied to very high skill, you can cause players to expect they WILL earn it. (OccupyGStreet)<br />
Extreme case: play 10,000 games to win something. The intention may be that makes the reward rare.&quot;... <br />

I just don't get excited at those random drops, anymore. Especially if it's gear--less so if it's cosmetic, like mounts, but yeah. It might be a result of years of RNG. It's not satisfying. The closest thing I can think of to what I feel is...relief.</div></div><hr />
