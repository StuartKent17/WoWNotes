It's just going to make the spec even more useless in instanced PvP while they'll remain broken as shit in world PvP :confused:</div></div><hr />

Do you even arena? Blood was being abused super hard above 2k. Everytime a tank spec is too strong it allows ppl to reach brackets they should not be able to. And right now blood is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Destro is one of the top dps on arena, its one of that class that can carry you to 2k with out any skill, its not so hard to cast every chos that you want, you got the most op interrupt in game, and lock is probalby the most tanky class in game, the only one problem is when facing warrior</div></div><hr />
