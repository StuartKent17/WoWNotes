&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;&quot;&gt;Move over Tyrande and Malfurion. Step aside Durotan and Draka. With the release of Blizzard's latest audio drama A Thousand Years of War, we finally learn about where Ranger General Alleria Windrunner (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Alleria_Windrunner) and her paladin companion High Exarch Turalyon (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Turalyon) have been.<br />
<br />
If you're not familiar with their story, don't feel too bad. Despite having statues dedicated to them in Stormwind's Valley of Heroes, items (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Turalyon%27s_Battlegear_set) and outposts (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Allerian_Stronghold) named for them, and a grown son (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Arator_the_Redeemer), the two have been MIA for the last 20 plus years of Azeroth's history. A Thousand Years of War catches us up on all that lost time. <br />
<br />
But what were they doing before all that? And why is important that they make a return now? Let's get you caught up on their story of love and war before A Thousand Years of War catches you up on the rest.<br />
<br />
Even if you don't know the details of these two lovebirds, you should be familiar with Alleria from her surname alone: Windrunner. The Windrunners are one of the oldest and most respected families of high elves, dating all the way back to the War of the Ancients (https://wow.gamepedia.com/War_of_the_Ancients). Alleria was foremost among her family, expected to succeed her mother Lireesa as the Ranger-General of Silvermoon. Instead, she chose to walk the path of the Farstriders (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Farstriders)--a group of high elves who roamed the whole of Azeroth protecting the interests of their people. Eventually, it would be Alleria's sister Sylvannas (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Sylvanas_Windrunner) who would take the role of Silvermoon's Ranger General before the Scourge made her the Queen of the Forsaken.<br />
<br />
It was during her time with the Farstriders that Alleria would first meet Turalyon, and from that fateful encounter they would be as inseparable as kobolds from candles.<br />
<br />
Turalyon began his career as a priest. Through his talent, he was named as one of the original Knights of the Silver Hand (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Knights_of_the_Silver_Hand), counting Uther Lightbringer (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Uther_the_Lightbringer) and Tirion Fordring (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Tirion_Fordring) as comrades in arms. He was close friends with Archmage Khadgar (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Khadgar) and Danath Trollbane (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Danath_Trollbane) while being the lieutenant to Anduin Lothar (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Anduin_Lothar). Where Alleria was related to some of the most important figures in Azeroth, Turalyon simply knew the rest.<br />
<br />
Together, Turalyon and Alleria fought the orcish horde during and after the Second War (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Second_War), becoming close comrades and even closer friends. After a particularly devastating raid on Silvermoon City that saw a portion of the Windrunner family destroyed, Alleria sought comfort in her close friend, and the two became lovers shortly after that. It wasn't long before their son, Arator, was born of that union.<br />
<br />
They fought battle after battle against the orcs, knowing little peace beyond each other. Their war eventually took them beyond the Dark Portal (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dark_Portal)and into Draenor (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Draenor), hoping to stop the orc threat at the source.<br />
<br />
But it was not to be.<br />
<br />
The orc shaman and leader of the Horde, Ner'zhul (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ner%27zhul), sought to escape defeat by opening portal after portal on Draenor, giving his Horde access to new and unspoiled worlds ripe for conquest. His powerful magic quickly became unstable and began to rip Draenor apart, sending the orcish armies into a panic and making them desperate to escape the splintering planet through the Dark Portal.<br />
<br />
Alleria and Turalyon understood what they had to do. While they fought to keep the orcs on the Draenor side of the portal, Khadgar and his mages worked to close the portal for good, keeping Azeroth and all their loved ones shielded from Draenor's total destruction.<br />
<br />
The ensuing chaos of Draenor's sundering into Outland (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Outland) ripped the pair from the world and they disappeared. When the Dark Portal opened again, Khadgar and the rest were found. Alleria and Turalyon were not. So where were they?<br />
<br />
In the Twisting Nether, lost from space and time until they were found by the Mother of Light herself, the naaru Xe'ra (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Xe%27ra).<br />
<br />
A Thousand Years of War picks up here. It tells the story of Alleria and Turalyon's journey with the Grand Army of Light (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Army_of_the_Light) and how their new found powers could determine the fate of all life. They could even hold the key to defeating the Legion once and for all. I'm not going to spoil the specifics here, so check it out for yourself. And when you do, you'll see why theirs is one of the greatest love stories WoW ever told (that wasn't Illidan and his brooding).&lt;/div&gt;</div></div><hr />

If they were, then they'd have been missing before even the first Warcraft game, and imply that the Windrunner Sisters were born over a thousand years before current events (that part isn't much of a stretch, though last I checked all three are High Elves and not Night Elves. Though I'll admit I do not know if the same ageless/immortality thing applied to High Elves as well). Not to mention their Son would be over a Thousand Years old as well.<br />
<br />
Essentially, unless there were stories passed down for a Millennia or their Son was some high-baller of a lore character, then there would be no reason why ANYONE in the current time-frame would have known about them.</div></div><hr />

time work diferent on the Twisting Nether. That why a thousand year past, and not that many past for us. <br />

The Twisting Nether is a super weird place connected to multiple realities and times. That why Gul'dan from the AU show up.</div></div><hr />

I haven't listened to the audio drama yet, but that's an absurdly easy &quot;conundrum&quot; to solve: it's likely they joined an ongoing war. I mean, we got in the real world the &quot;Hundred Year War (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War)&quot; that happened in a time when very few people even reached 80 years old...</div></div><hr />

It's not bashing when I'm stating facts. We've been in the TN CANONICALLY several times and not experienced this. So to suddenly make it like this just to sound cool makes them awful. Hell I never brought up Twilight personally and have never read any of them, but I was only replying to the idiocy of claiming anything in WoW is a better love story than anything much less I doubt the inconsistencies of Twilight aren't there as much as WoW has much less WoW had a nerd who gained power at the the helm who would lie to get applause at Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

Other than that, awesome story! I never played a hunter personally and only heard about their order campaign from others, but I love how the story here connects the dots within their campaign.<br />
Ever since 7.3 hit, I was disappointed with them both for abandoning their son, but the story/audiodrama made it a great deal more plausible and understandable. Alleria is fierce enough that it makes sense that she would rather fight another war than endanger her son and Turalyon is a good husband and follows her lead. <br />
Overall, Alleria is a total badass and my new favorite (Windrunner), Turalyon is cute and a decent companion for her. As odd as it sounds, imo it felt as if those two characters truly click; unlike most of the couples in the Blizz Universe. I only hope they will keep Alleria (and through her, Turalyon) around for quite some time.</div></div><hr />

Hell I never brought up Twilight personally and have never read any of them, but I was only replying to the idiocy of claiming anything in WoW is a better love story than anything much less I doubt the inconsistencies of Twilight aren't there as much as WoW has much less WoW had a nerd who gained power at the the helm who would lie to get applause at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
How is it a fact?<br />
<br />
And what the hell do you even mean by &quot;TN&quot;??<br />
<br />
I dunno wtf story you been following, but it is MUCH bigger than some &quot;love story&quot; between them 2.. Uh, hello, Jaina &amp; Arthas??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except it explains that in the story as well with the whole storm in the whirlpool bit. Different parts of the twisting nether experience time differently, just like different parts of the water move differently and other parts move even more differently when effected by chaotic forces. It's not all the same speed, in some parts time flows much quicker than in Azeroth, in other parts it's similar and I imagine in some parts it's even slower than it is in Azeroth. So they could spend 10 years in one area and only a month passes on Azeroth but in that same month another part of the TN could experience 100 years.</div></div><hr />

It has been stated innumberable times that C'thun and Yogg Saron are dead. They. Are. Dead.<br />

So what I want to know is: Does this 1k year story shed light on how &quot;the nether&quot; warps time and space to allow Turalyon and Alleria to have experience 1000 years, yet both Argus and Outland are in the Nether, and those on both worlds, don't return to Azeroth with like, 2 months having gone by when they were on Outland/Argus for an hour. Or how about those Artifact weapons we get from Legion held worlds, where we spent 10-60 minutes, or even the Demon Hunter starter quests. Pretty sure that's in the nether, too, but noooooope, time didn't go by at a weird super fast pace for us.</div></div><hr />

Other blue posts state that they are dead. The thing is, like Y'saarj, there remains... remnants of them. Ghosts, in a sense. They can even be revived, as Cho'gall attempted to do with C'thun before Cata started.</div></div><hr />

Because it adds absolutely nothing to the story.<br />
<br />
Just saying that it has been 20 years or so since Alleria and Turalyon disappeared would have been well enough. Adding higher numbers like a thousand years did absolutely nothing. He's still only been gone for 20 years, he's still alive. He's human, he doesn't live to his thousands.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All this dead and not dead is kinda messy when it comes to old gods. I mean Y'Shaarj was torn out of azeroth and squished like a bug, yet his heart was intact and the Vale's waters revived it.<br />
<br />
Granted Arthas also retained his humanity after stabbing his own torn out heart so maybe it's just lazy writing and not an old god power.<br />

By decade o Azeroth, but it took 1k years of fighting to accomplish that. Had the invasion not been delayed, we wouldn't have been ready. That is the point. They put in so much work just to give us a small edge against the legion.</div></div><hr />

And there's absolutely no purpose to it except for &quot;sounding cool.&quot;<br />

<br />
The thousand years isn't added for Turalyon and Alleria. The purpose, from the writer's perspective, is to add an extra strength to the Legion. As mentioned by Xe'ra, because time moves much more slowly for the Legion, they have significantly more time to plan a way to destroy a world. Add that to the fact that when you kill them outside the Twisting Nether, they become an every increasing threat because even if you push them back, they will recovery much faster than you can and return more prepared. This then pushes the idea that it is absolutely necessary to eventually strike the Legion head on instead of just fending them off, because otherwise you will eventually lose. <br />
<br />
So because this little detail was added, and 20 years have past for us, Turalyon and Alleria having been fighting for 1000 years is simply a by product of that advantage the Legion was given by the writers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that's just in 7 years. In a thousand bunch of adventurers would probably liberated every single of Legion conquered worlds. And cleansed few Void infested ones in the side.<br />

The original quote:<br />
<br />
<br />
Wanna bet the player can accomplish far more with 1k year of fighting?<br />
<br />
Was talking about the player (singular), not the adventurers. I interpreted this as an exaggeration (though I could be wrong) and replied with the obvious truth: &quot;Story-wise, no we couldn't.&quot; and then a joke: &quot;Gameplay-wise, probably.&quot;<br />
<br />
But on the topic of the adventurers' strength relative to the Army of the Light, I would still say we (alone) would not have been able to accomplish as much as the Army of the Light, who have Xe'ra.<br />
<br />
Any time we have faced a great threat, it has not been alone. Against Kil'jaeden in the Sunwell, we had the help of the Blue Dragons and Anveena turning the powers of the Sunwell against him. And in the end, we just pushed him back. We didn't kill him. We had the aid of Alexstraza and the Red Dragonflight against Malygos. When we fought Yogg, the Keepers helped us. The Lich King killed us, but Tirion was able to destroy Frostmourne and release the spirits inside to make Arthas vulnerable. Cenarius, Hamuul and Malfurion helped us when fighting Ragnaros in the Firelands. We needed of all the Dragon Aspects and the Dragon Soul to stop Deathwing. The Light of Lei Shi is what allows us to take on the Sha of Fear. Lei Shen was no where near full strength when we fought him. The list goes on.<br />
<br />
We are definitely strong, but we aren't gods.</div></div><hr />

You need to read the OP and then read my quote again. Because it seems reading comprehension isn't your thing, neither is humor it seems.</div></div><hr />

So it looks like we indeed have 1 old god alive, despite what Blizzard has said some time ago<br />
<br />
Of course there is one left alive? N'zoth is already counted into the lineup of 4 we have. Y'Shaarj, Yogg-Saron, C'thun, N'zoth. The Old God she usurps in the vision of the Void is N'zoth, the &quot;drowned god&quot;, or in this case, the one beneath the waves. The implications of it are ... interesting. If all of this happens, we're in for drama time. Turalyon, her killing Arator. Jesus, that would be heartbreaking, but such a nice twist, if they do what Diablo did not. Alleria. And we are heroes, the point Illidan has created throughout Legion is similar to the main-metaphor of Mists of Pandaria, with the feelings and faction war. We control our own destiny. I totally see them reworking the factions after this audio drama has been released to us now. Shadow and Light. Your choice. Slave to the Light or Freelancer under the Void.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So he's immortal to aging (like I predicted the moment they started to talk about &quot;thousand years.&quot;) but he can still die through any other means. Those thousand years added nothing, other than being a tool to make Turalyon sound cool.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing they want Turalayon to be imbued with the light as a counterpoint to Alleria being infused with the void, and Illidan telling everyone to HTFU, for how they tied together ending the legion and releasing/redeeming Argus.<br />
<br />
I'm still waiting for some kind of resolution on the Helya/Sylvannas storyline.<br />
<br />
The only piece of what I'd consider potentially bad story writing is void form. How is Alleria not just a shadowpriest now, chilling out in voidform? Why has noone thought to ask shadowpriests about the void that they basically worship now, and how are shadowpriests able to cask holy and shadow spells if the void and light can't be together?</div></div><hr />

i think Alleria form is more that just a shadow form. She has the power of a void god.</div></div><hr />
