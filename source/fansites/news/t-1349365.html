Connected Realms Update<br />
The first two realms are finally being connected on Wednesday!<br />
In order to implement our first Connected Realms, Boulderfist and Bloodscalp will be taken down for an extended maintenance beginning Wednesday, September 25, at 3:00 a.m. PDT until approximately 11:00 a.m. PDT. During this time these realms will be unavailable for play. Additional realm connections are planned for the near future, and we’ll be posting a full list at WorldofWarcraft.com as soon as we’ve finalized the details.<br />

Conquest Points Cap Bug<br />
give everyone full s14 gear - problem solved. <br />
We won't be granting full Grievous gear to all players, in fact those that acquired gear from the increased cap should not get too fond of holding onto it. We plan on dealing with this matter appropriately, however we cannot elaborate on our plans at this time. <br />
<br />
I'm starting to get very concerned about this, still nothing and it's been days now. Come on Blizzard, shape up. <br />
We'll be communicating on our plans as soon™ as possible. Taking gear away is a very delicate process and one which we definitely don't want to jump in to, too hastily, the same goes for any other actions we may take. We've recently changed the level requirement on the Grievous weapons to ensure that people cannot use them for the time being and we're looking into what else we can do to resolve this situation. <br />
<br />
We understand that this is a frustrating situation for everyone, but we ask for your patience while we deal with this matter further. I've also increased the posting limit for this thread, so please feel free to continue discussing this topic.<br />

Heroes of the Storm Trademark<br />
A &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot; trademark appeared in the New Zealand database tonight, and you can find a fun speculation thread on the forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1349283-Blizzard-trademarks-quot-Heroes-of-the-Storm-quot). <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this trademark isn't confirmed just yet. It isn't likely to be used for a WoW expansion, as the trademark application mentions the software being used on &quot;mobile and cellular phones, laptops, handheld computers, and tablet PCs&quot;.<br />
<br />

<br />
At least on Brazilian realms, you can see ppl from other realms in timeless isle, creating groups for Celestials and Ordos (and basically lagged the entire place on 1st week). There is even the info in their tooltips when you mouse over these players &quot;coalesced realm, xxxxxx&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
We could even think it was just realid friends grouping with someone of that server, but... so many of them??? To the point of creating such a lag making the isle unplayable on the 1st week?? We're not talking about 3, 5, 10 players around the isle... more like 80+. The Celestial Court was... omg.</div></div><hr />

That shit should have been ready to do within the first week if not on patch day itself, or at the least a list so people knew what to plan for and if they wasn't happy, a free transfer or something.</div></div><hr />

Please, what a joke. They have had many dead realms for over a year now, this needed to happen a long time ago. The only reason it had not been happening is because this was one massive cash grab. The reason it's happening now is because it got to the point more people were just quitting then giving into Blizzard's absurd server transfer fees.<br />
<br />
The fact they are rolling this out so slow is pathetic. Shows once again just how little of concern Blizzard has for it's customers. They know and have said that the players on these dead realms have been getting a worse playing experience then those on healthy realms. What did they do? Nothing till now when it got to the tipping point of costing them more then they were bringing in with the server transfer fees. They know which servers are dead, been dead and they knew 5.4 wouldn't be bringing enough people back to save most of those servers and many people wouldn't be back due to not wanting to play on a dead server. This should of gone out live with 5.4.</div></div><hr />

Like so many whiny, immature, &quot;GIMME GIMME GIMME&quot; WoW players of today, you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. You have no idea how complex or risky such an operation is. You're probably one of those people who thinks that a guild transfer is akin to a &quot;copy paste&quot; and that you could write some &quot;code&quot; in Visual Basic or JavaScript that would solve complex server problems with a single if-then statement. You have no idea whatsoever what it takes to create a release like patch 5.4, or the connected realms system, but because you want it NOW, everyone working on it at Blizzard must either be stupid, ignorant, or have an ulterior motive. It never ceases to amaze me how people like you put this stuff together. Blizzard has all the information, you have almost none, but still, when something doesn't work out exactly the way you want or expect, then it must be that you know everything and Blizzard is SO lazy / ignorant for not realizing they could just flip a switch and do it your way. It never occurs to you that, given the VAST gap of knowledge and experience on the product, there might be factors in play that you aren't aware of. Like Blizzard employees are sitting around saying, &quot;You know what's a great way to make more money? Pissing people off just because we can!&quot;. (Then you'll turn around in a week and claim Blizzard is &quot;greedy&quot; because they enjoy continuing to make money off their product.)<br />

You're right, they didn't continually offer free transfers between various realms, create cross-realm battlegrounds, create cross-realm arenas, create cross-realm dungeons, add in a powerful cross-realm grouping tool, create cross-realm raiding, create a system for hosting cross-realm raiding groups, spend over a year developing the complex cross-realm zones system, develop a system to incentivize players to provide needed support roles across all realms in a group, create an entire tier of content just for region-wide raiding, develop a system allowing players to party with friends on any realm in the region and play any content with them, changed said system from a premium benefit for WoW Remote subscribers, to a free perk every player gets, spend significant resources to add the capability for entire guilds to transfer or faction change together, and now, spent god knows how long (probably more than 6 months, given how long CRZ supposedly took) on connected realms which had to have been complicated as hell seeing as how it breaks pretty much every unique naming constraint the game used to have (character name, guild name, etc).<br />
<br />
I'm sure, for some twisted reasons in your mind, none of that counts - probably because it isn't exactly what you wanted (or as you'll say, &quot;everyone&quot;) - so &quot;they did nothing&quot; becomes a valid statement. Yeah, right.<br />
<br />
And before you think about a retort that involves some lame attempt to claim you have some kind of expertise in the field (i.e., &quot;I'm an IT Professional&quot;, or &quot;I work for a 'company' that makes 'games'...&quot;, or my personal favorite, &quot;I run a private server&quot;), think carefully about the level of knowledge you've already illustrated...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Robert3620</div><div class="date">2013-09-26, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like so many whiny, immature, &quot;GIMME GIMME GIMME&quot; WoW players of today, you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. You have no idea how complex or risky such an operation is. You're probably one of those people who thinks that a guild transfer is akin to a &quot;copy paste&quot; and that you could write some &quot;code&quot; in Visual Basic or JavaScript that would solve complex server problems with a single if-then statement. You have no idea whatsoever what it takes to create a release like patch 5.4, or the connected realms system, but because you want it NOW, everyone working on it at Blizzard must either be stupid, ignorant, or have an ulterior motive. It never ceases to amaze me how people like you put this stuff together. Blizzard has all the information, you have almost none, but still, when something doesn't work out exactly the way you want or expect, then it must be that you know everything and Blizzard is SO lazy / ignorant for not realizing they could just flip a switch and do it your way. It never occurs to you that, given the VAST gap of knowledge and experience on the product, there might be factors in play that you aren't aware of. Like Blizzard employees are sitting around saying, &quot;You know what's a great way to make more money? Pissing people off just because we can!&quot;. (Then you'll turn around in a week and claim Blizzard is &quot;greedy&quot; because they enjoy continuing to make money off their product.)<br />

<br />
Just to start: This has been a problem for YEARS. Not once did they offer transfers off the dead servers for free to more active ones, not a single time. <br />
<br />
The features you listed while nice for some didn't solve the problems of low population servers for a large amount of people. It maybe very hard to do what they have done but at any time they could of offered free transfers off the dead servers, any time they wanted. They choose to not do so, they choose to provide people on those servers a sub par gaming experience, they admit that. <br />
<br />
As for wanting it now, well yes many of the people on these servers do want it right fucking now because they have been dealing with it for years. Years of sub par gaming experience. I think when that's the case it's pretty eazy to understand how people could be fed up and tired of Blizzard doing things in a slow manner. The truth is this should of came out the moment the patch went live. This is yet one more tier many people are not going to be able to fully take part in because they are getting a late start due to being stuck on a dead server.<br />
<br />
Also please do not try to act as if Blizzard offering services they charge for as being some kinda of good thing to those on dead servers. Being able to server transfer yourself or entire guilds is something Blizzard profited off of. The tools you mention did not go near far enough to solve the problems the players on dead servers have been suffering with. So feel free to white kinight on behalf of Blizzard who has really given those on these servers real shitty choices to deal with the problem and only now has come in to solve it when it reached the point it was losing them more then they could keep gouging out of those stuck on these servers.</div></div><hr />

Something strange about Paragon on Paragon fighting though; seems like they'd know the fight really well.<br />

Maybe they're distracted by trying to figure out which one of them Ka'roz is based on...</div></div><hr />
