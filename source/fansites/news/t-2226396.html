Addon - Immersion<br />
Immersion (https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/257550-immersion) is an addon that provides a more immersive quest text frame. It uses the talking heads system to display quest text, but still allows you to skip things when you are in a hurry.<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Blizzard and Professionalism<br />
The WoW forums have always been a place of back and forths between CMs, Devs, and Players, and I've watched the back and forths between Lore, Kalgan, Tigole, Bashiok, Eyonix, Tseric, etc and our players for years, and I just want to be clear that we don't consider this anything new. I think it's what makes our forums a fun place while discussing serious issues. I'm appreciative of the overall conversation, though, and I've read through all of it, both on here and /r/wow, throughout the day.<br />
<br />
My post in question was directed at a snarky player on the &quot;there's no content&quot; train who hadn't touched a good amount of Legion's content, including LFR, minus a wing of Nighthold. My comment to the player was only pointing out facts, albeit in a snarky way not unknown to the forums.<br />
<br />
I think folks have gotten confused by the message on both sides. If you tell me, &quot;There's nothing to do in Legion!&quot; I'll tell you that's a lie, flat out. If you tell me, &quot;There's nothing for *me* to do in Legion!&quot; or &quot;Nothing in this patch makes me want to play!&quot; that's a topic I think we can discuss. Now, the post in question was the former, and, as said, in an attempt to be catty towards me, that comment was made. It's easy to delete a comment and move on, but it takes a lot more willpower to engage in a conversation, call out false statements (even if done half-assedly in a joking manner), and try to engage on the real issue.<br />
<br />
Our team is not part of Customer Service, and we don't necessarily adhere to the same levels of 'professionalism' that they may in their day-to-day, and, even when we do, it's very much relaxed as it is in most of the industry. Not trying to put down our Customer Service compatriots in any way, they do a stellar job, I just think its important to note that our teams goals are different. My goal here is first and foremost engagement and community-building, and I'm given free rein to do that as I see fit (albeit to my own pleasure and detriment). I appreciate everyone here who talks about their time in CS roles, I've had some experience in them myself, and I understand the difference of the role vs the audience in both capacities.<br />
<br />
An interesting note, but I don't see our team as 'professional', in the sense that we uphold ourselves to some golden, glorious, corporate standard. I consider us 'experts' in our crafts, but nothing more than players who sit at the developer's table who have been given blue text and sometime receive emails with information that you may not see.<br />
<br />
So GD's righteous indignation is chasing off another Blizzard employee? The only one that still posts here?<br />
No one's chasing me off, don't worry.<br />
<br />
I think we can all stand to take and throw a few punches, and we'll all get along better if we have a bit of fun. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1062254-blizzard-and-professionalism/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20754917221?page=9#172))<br />

For a professional, the needs of the customer (the player) are foremost. If you need to bend things for the customer, so be it. For the expert, the perfection of the craft comes first. If the customer doesn't like it, so be it.</div></div><hr />

For a good reason if you ask me. It shows poor judgement of Ornyx. Maybe he just had a lapse or a bad day, that can happen.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, the lynch mob mentality it inspired in those cheering to &quot;shoot down the trolls&quot; is evidence enough that his behavior was not appropriate for a Blizzard representative, customer service or not.</div></div><hr />

Whether you think the content in Legion is good, bad, amazing or the worst the games ever had, one thing that I'd say is a fact is that there's a lot to do, not even compared to the previous iteration in WoD, with a lot still to come. I think he could have worded things a lot better (talking about Ornyx), particularly in regards to his team being less inclined to be as courteous to the community as other parts of the Blizzard team are, but I also understand fully why he challenged the OP on his comments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I do think it depends on whats being said and it's context, I believe the original message was something like 'you can't say that when you've done less than 35% (or 25%?) of legion content after I checked your amoury' or something along those lines. I don't think this was a good idea this time. I've done all heroic encounters and 4 class halls, 1 run through of BS. I'd quite happily say I've maybe done 20% of legion content. <br />

<br />
Again context, I've been unprofessional in my summer work multiple times, sometimes it's called for. Off the top of my head one morning we sold a 50 quid BB gun, (fast forward to the end of the day) the lad brought it back wanting his money back because he didn't get a laser sight with it which showed it on the box (despite being told in the AM, there is no laser pen, it's been removed as they are illegal to sell in the uk now with them, the company just cant be arsed to change the packaging) Anyways he argues with my boss, my boss tell's him no 10 times over politely, next thing we know the guy rips his shirt off. The boss dives behind the counter and I step between them, the guys forehead on mine, can smell the beer on his breath and feel the sweat of his forehead of mine. At this point, I had enough and told him to get out of the shop willingly, or I'll put him flat on his arse then throw him out. That's unprofessional but was needed on the day</div></div><hr />

There's a difference - you approached each other as equals. <br />
<br />
A Blizzard representative and a player, who could even be a minor, will never be equals. In that context Ornyx represents the authority (Blizzard) who can lay down the law at least in the forums while the player is just the player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that or because the blues are constantly blamed for everything every day (even him) they are yelled at, called worthless, usless, and KYS, even the rare death threat when a big change happens.<br />
also people seem to think people like orynx are devs and complain about stuff like &quot;wtf get back to devolping the game fucktard, stop making shitty posts on the forums&quot;<br />
<br />
they get flamed, trolled, yelled at, blamed, and right out abused by thousands of people every day, dont you think they deserve abit of fire back?<br />
i mean donald trump does it every tweet, and yet hes still the president of the united states of america. but a forum mod cant make a joke about somone having done little content but still complains about lack of content.<br />

im pretty sure his apology post is nothing but a lie, he knew the poster was being snarky, and responded, but then everyone made it out like he just commited murder and suddenly he HAD to apologise, or risk getting a overflow of people screaming at blizzard to fire him.<br />
i have seen some pictures of people literally sending letters and emails to blizzard telling them to fire him or they will stop playing their games, like holy fucking shit.<br />

he was not wrong, he checked the persons acheivements, they are account wide<br />
the person had done 4/12 campaigns<br />
never did trial of valor on any dificulty<br />
only beat raids on lfr/normal<br />
has NEVER EVER done Rarena or a RBG<br />
never touched tol barad or ashran (still useful to this day so i still consider them sorta)<br />
did not touch the illidan quest line at all<br />
aswell as some things here and there not worth mentioning as its like &quot;has not done this dungeon&quot;<br />
also since then that person has done alot, they were missing more before the post, but i dont wanna compare all the dates.<br />
<br />
25% was maybe over doing it, maybe 50% but yeah, the person still was missing alot</div></div><hr />

So many forum posters think they've just dropped the mic with their snark. Fuck em, respond how ever. Its a forum and the posters mostly treat it that way. Treat em either way. There isn't content for that guy, fucking quit. If you aren't playing, why are you on the forum protesting? The game hasn't changed that much when it comes to what is provided to do. The player didn't even finish quest lines, the game isn't for him. Was it petty to respond? Sure, but so be it, maybe someone will think twice before thinking they just won the game with their sideways comment trying to be clever. Poke the bear sometimes the bear pokes back.<br />
<br />
I see no reason to fire him. I'm sure he got a that wasn't a smart move talk, but that shit happens. People are human. And honestly if you can't handle shade when you throw it, don't open the fucking library.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it kept getting pushed back in the news queue, sorry about that! I'd venture a guess that most of our users don't go and seek the new videos out though, so hopefully it was still relevant to most people.</div></div><hr />

However, off-center camera in third-person view is the most tacky immersion-breaking crap that was ever popularized and is only ever acceptable when iron-sighting. There's a reason Souls games don't capitalize on it, cause it's fucking awful.<br />
<br />
Also Ornyx being a pseudo-intellectual is nothing new, just like most of the &quot;talking heads&quot; at Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

The ultimate issue with blizzard community leaders and game masters is that much of what they do is &quot;on the job training&quot; and they kind of make rules up as they go along or interpret them as they please. For example, if you ask one GM for something in game and they say no, and then you open another ticket you can get a completely different answer to the same copy/pasted question. There is little or no consistency which is why players and forum posters get so annoyed with the answers they get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a good reason if you ask me. It shows poor judgement of Ornyx. Maybe he just had a lapse or a bad day, that can happen.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, the lynch mob mentality it inspired in those cheering to &quot;shoot down the trolls&quot; is evidence enough that his behavior was not appropriate for a Blizzard representative, customer service or not.<br />
<br />
TBH I hope they fired Ornyx. For any employee to post that on a public forum just hurt the companies image. Does not matter if the poster &quot;deserved&quot; it or not. They are representing the corporation , and for them to say they dont adhere to the same corporate values in regards to Customer Service would get you terminated from any other company. This can be used as a prime example as how Blizzard has completely lost its way and how out of touch they are.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, I'd be more likely to quit Blizzard IF they fired him. World really needs to drop this whole &quot;Customer is always right!&quot; bullshit. 90% of customers bitch and complain about the stupidest shit, or things that don't even exist. More times then not the customer is wrong and we really need to stop making people feel like special snowflakes just to get their $$.<br />
<br />
World's too PC as it is.</div></div><hr />

Something tells me if you had a issue with a product or a company, and a CS rep told you to basically fuck off, you would be screaming about it really loudly. Go ahead and start a business and adapt that mentality and you will be out of business in very short order.</div></div><hr />

No, other end, and my boss gladly told them to fuck off, because not every customer is worth the hassle, some are just so fucking stupid it brings down the company even having them around.<br />
<br />
They do quite well in their business, but they don't bend over for fools.<br />
<br />
I don't expect a business to bend over for me EVERY time, unless they really fucked up. Just solve the issue and move on.</div></div><hr />

This isn't the first time a CM has done this. They've &quot;pwned&quot; players before, like pointing out they haven't finished a raid they claim is &quot;too easy&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is a tempest in a teapot. Calling for the CM to be fired? LOL. Nah. His boss should buy him a beer at 5pm tonight. <br />
<br />
They could have just banned that player. Would you prefer that? All of this is because a player ran his mouth. Is the problem how the CMs deal with that, or getting players to stop running their mouths? <br />
<br />
Who am I kidding, the Warcraft forums have been about shitposting and attacking the CMs from day one. This is just more of that nonsense.<br />

I wish he hadn't used that.<br />
<br />
For a professional, the needs of the customer (the player) are foremost. If you need to bend things for the customer, so be it. For the expert, the perfection of the craft comes first. If the customer doesn't like it, so be it.<br />
<br />
They're not professional customer service - he went to great pains in his post to point that out. They're Community Managers. They decide what the definition of that is. Putting the customer first is up to them to prioritize. <br />
<br />
It's pretty easy - don't want to get called out like that? Don't run your mouth.</div></div><hr />

Immersion still works with talking heads disabled, it uses its own talking head style frames. I use it for leveling when I want to take it slow and enjoy the quests but not for daily'max level stuff.<br />

Imagine you spending months or years on a project and when you finally show it to people they tell you it's garbage. You wouldn't be very happy about it and it would probably crush your spirit. Well the WoW community does this to the devs ALL the time. Yes it helps to give feedback on what the community thinks is good or not, but it's the way most do it that is the issue. To just come out and say &quot;there's nothing to do&quot; is not very helpful and to be honest isn't true. A lot of people speed through the content and want instant gratification but then turn around and complain when they run out of new content. Slow down, take your time, do other things. I am in the process of getting xmog pieces, why, just because I can. I use an addon called Wardrobe Helper and I spend a day or two out of the week just getting xmog from raids and dungeons. I know not everyone will like every aspect of the game but if you NEVER try any other aspect how will you know if you will enjoy it or not. Try something new and you may be surprised.</div></div><hr />

That's not the case with Forum posting, especially in the Official WoW Forums. A closer analogy will be<br />
<br />
Customer: Your product sucks. (Most of the time doesn't have a concrete reason, or have inconsistencies between different reasons)<br />
CM: 1. I will deliver the message (generic statement most people hate) 2. Can you explain yourself? (Customer can't articulate most of the time) 3. I disagree because ....<br />
Customer: Go f yourself.<br />
<br />
At this point it's attacking another person, not making a statement about a product anymore. Product feedback isn't a one way street where the developer or representative can just take it. If you cannot take feedback for your feedback, don't bother making one.</div></div><hr />
