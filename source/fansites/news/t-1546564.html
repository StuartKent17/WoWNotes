Gotta love these responses, because the 300+ mounts and pets in game already came at the cost of 6 expansions worth of content. Get a fucking clue.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthMonk79</div><div class="date">2014-07-03, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe its a different team that does pets then those that do zone art. There are multiple teams in WoW that do different things, not everybody works on everything together. They showed that at blizzcon when they had a guy who's job was literally just props art, kobold candle stuff. So I think the people working on animals/pets/mounts aren't the same crew that do dungeons, raids, cities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is different teams. Some artists focus on nothing but the creation of things like trees and terrain. Others work on models, others are animation. Many people don't have any idea as to just how many people it takes to create the game they're running around in.</div></div><hr />

The Terra Corgi<br />
The Leaf Corgi<br />
and so on<br />

Please spread the words so more people will buy our pets and mounts so we can maybe be able to effort water and food in the future for our families. Your millions of 15$ a month and 60$ for expansions and retail game isn't enough to support us, even with all of the expensive services we provide for players, faction changes, name changes, race changes, server transfers and the list goes on. Now buy this pet on Blizzard store and save many money hungry people!<br />

Your millions of 15$ a month and 60$ for expansions and retail game isn't enough to support us, even with all of the expensive services we provide for players, faction changes, name changes, race changes, server transfers and the list goes on. Now buy this pet on Blizzard store and save many money hungry people!<br />
<br />
Now that being said, it's an awesome looking pet indeed. Wish I could every get to own one of these badass pets and mounts that unfortunately end up on the store. Despite the amount I pay monthly and the expensive expansions I pay for.<br />

Well when you pay a monthly sub with the expectation that you will be able to earn everything in game and they put some of the best looking pets/mounts behind a pay wall it kind of pisses some people off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely, but this stuff started back with the sparkle pony. Eventually you just have to weigh your options. Being bitter or having weird video game principles isn't going to get you that mount/pet, so if you want it bad enough, it's going to have to be worth that 10/25 bucks. <br />
<br />
Personally, I've not bought any of their mounts, but I've gotten 3 of the pets and won one through a WoW head contest. I love the in game pets and had to get over my pig headedness about pay walls and corporate greed.<br />
<br />
Couldn't be happier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're not able to finish the main cities of the expansion and have to resort to copypasting something underwhelming, then maybe you should cut at least some of these pets and mounts to get some art assets done. Because that's one of the things they claimed. That they can't finish the cities because they don't have the art assets for them and that at this point it would take too long to get it done.

<br />
Another way to look at it, from those that have defended Blizz, &quot;Why are you complaining about WoD? You can't fly because they want us to explore, they aren't capitals because they changed their mind, he didn't matter, they are giving is a Corgi so forgive them.&quot;</div></div><hr />

The cities will be finished and will be in game in the exact same state that they'd be if they were our capitals, but with no portals. It wasn't a resource drain or a time constraint, they changed their minds about the location. <br />

1. To make the PVP island more populated. This is a wintergrasp type thing where big numbers are needed to make it fun<br />
2. To decrease lag in starter zones - same reason Dalaran was moved in Wotlk ( or more correctly, why the zone was broken apart)<br />
3. To balance factions - This is a bit stupid, but there were a lot of complaints in alpha and on the forums that Alliance was getting a huge lore city and horde was getting a cave that was never heard of before.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately I've been through that thought process a little too many times as of late. <br />
&quot;Oooh a new mount.. I wonder where they'll sell..&quot;, way more often than not they end up being Store assets. <br />
<br />
Hopefully, will not be purchasable from the Store and it's going to be a reward in-game of some sort. If it turns out to indeed be purchasable from the Store, oh well, it's quite a nice pretty pet, but will not buy.</div></div><hr />

You guys really need something else to occupy your free time with.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately they've contradicted themselves on this issue. The last thing a dev said on this issue was that the places are terrible to begin with, they will not be finished in time, they will be empty and therefore not make good homes and that we should be glad Blizzard is sparing us this ordeal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
@nairmak_gren this is not a simple change like a class spell tweak. it would cost hundreds if not thousands of man hours at this stage.<br />
<br />
@nairmak_gren we know people were really excited about Karabor &amp; Bladespire but we do need to ship the expansion at some point too.<br />
<br />
@nairmak_gren (and honestly neither of them is particularly friendly for layout of a city space, you would hate us later for doing it)[/B][/U]<br />
<br />
@nite_moogle forgive me if I'm wrong but all you'd have to do is put portals, vendors, etc inside karabor/bladespire and flag it as a sanctuary, no? <br />
<br />
@nairmak_gren portals, vendors, auctioneers, decor, guards, directions, phasing and more I'm sure I am forgetting -- it's a LOT of work.<br />

Most pets are a reflection of an in game model somehow I have seen. Its neat looking, but really, another blizz store pet? Of course people will just buy it blindly because &quot;look at the cute!!&quot;. Now, it being blizz store is just speculation, but that is how they usually do with pets such as this when they are announced.<br />
<br />
I just wish people would stop buying them. I mean really people, if you stop paying like some mindless drone long enough guess what? The new future pets that are really cute and awesome will be released In game for free! <br />
<br />
Its not that I don't have the money for one, its that I know my interest in WoW is loosening. It wont be around forever, that's just a fact. I would regret buying all these net pets when wow is gone. I mean, 10, 15, 20 or more for a pet or mount, that in the end you don't get to keep? At least with a sub I am paying for the entertainment it brings me. With this, in the end I have nothing to show for it. Paying for one doesn't even get me at least a month of time. Im unsubbed, and the money I have spent on the pets I have and the mount or two I got already means nothing to them. I don't get to keep playing to keep enjoying them.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Strypewolf</div><div class="date">2014-07-04, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is sadly depressing all these complaints about things being behind a paywall, which is not that many if you consider the entire scope. Things to consider:<br />
<br />
A) Like others have said, no one is holding a gun to your head and demanding you buy this, or any, cash shop pet/mount/etc.<br />
B) No one is also saying you have to like it. You can simply just say, you don't like it without making a bunch of contrived assumed reasons to try to justify your standpoint.<br />
C) And probably most importantly, yes, it's a sub-based game in which I will note despite that rapid increase of inflation over the 10 years that WoW has been out, has never gone up 1 cent. However, take a step back and think of all the art materials, servers, cables, voice actor payrolls, employee payrolls, routers, building costs, advertisement fees, stockholder dividends, and I could go on and on. That money doesn't just magically appear and while WoW does have several million subscribers, $15 a month by itself is *not* going to cut it. They do need supplemental income from time to time to cover extra costs and make sure they have a fair profit at the end of the year so they can continue to create new things. Blizzard is a business, and if they're going to stay in business, they need to make a profit if they're to keep this game we play, and hopefully love, going.<br />
<br />
So before you go all rage face, doomsayer, trolling, whatever, take a step back and think for a moment. Every dollar you contribute to this game is going to keeping the game alive in some form or fashion even if you don't see it up front on your screens.<br />
<br />
I'll probably get flamed for this, but that's fine. If this gets through to even just one person, I'll be happy. :)</div></div><hr />

So you are fine with buying it... Okay.... but would it also not just be lovely... If they added actually pets and mounts to the game? that you could earn or just get in game, could buy them with, oh what is it called, IN GAME currency. but no, you are right it is only 10 dollars, like the other 10 pets for a total of 110 dollars with the soon to be added, Added with the 8 mounts of 25 dollars for a sum of 200 dollars. Yeah 310 dollars is a fair prise for mounts and pets if you want them. when you alreayd sub for it...</div></div><hr />

You are most certainly correct. That being said, how can it be so justifiable all the time that all the cool and nice looking pets that they put a Lot of effort into always end up behind a paywall as of lately? It used to be they make a really amazing mount / pet and it goes in game. Depending on how cool it is, that effects its difficulty in acquiring it. I am fine with one or two here and there, but they are just rollin em out. For a sub game they certainly are getting into micro transactions heavily. Best of both worlds I guess. The monthly sub fee and the F2P micor transactions.<br />
<br />
<br />
B) No one is also saying you have to like it. You can simply just say, you don't like it without making a bunch of contrived assumed reasons to try to justify your standpoint.Just like you're doing here? People state their opinions and want to state their reasoning, just as you are doing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
C) And probably most importantly, yes, it's a sub-based game in which I will note despite that rapid increase of inflation over the 10 years that WoW has been out, has never gone up 1 cent. However, take a step back and think of all the art materials, servers, cables, voice actor payrolls, employee payrolls, routers, building costs, advertisement fees, stockholder dividends, and I could go on and on.

They do need supplemental income from time to time to cover extra costs and make sure they have a fair profit at the end of the year so they can continue to create new things. Blizzard is a business, and if they're going to stay in business, they need to make a profit if they're to keep this game we play, and hopefully love, going.Im sorry, this is just wrong on So many levels. 7 Million subs have been fine since BC. They didn't start store stuff until Cata. Not to mention all the F2P games seem to do just as good staying afloat with Far less money then what blizzard brings in monthly just on subs alone. 7 million times 15 is 105mil, a Month. That is 1.2Billion a year before taxes and any costs. That is subs Alone. I dare you to continue this line even knowing how much money before taxes and costs they make. They hardly &quot;need&quot; supplemental income of any kind with the kind of money they are bringing in on Just WoW. Lets not forget they also have Starcraft sales, diablo sales, and Hearthstone. <br />
<br />
So yes, in short, 15$ a month Will and Has cut it since they started. So much so that they have been able to grow and expand. Saying it wont is complete and utter Bull Crap. <br />
<br />
<br />
So before you go all rage face, doomsayer, trolling, whatever, take a step back and think for a moment. Every dollar you contribute to this game is going to keeping the game alive in some form or fashion even if you don't see it up front on your screens.<br />
<br />
I'll probably get flamed for this, but that's fine. If this gets through to even just one person, I'll be happy. :)Doubtful. You're post is not exactly a logical one. They get more then enough money on a yearly basis just from 7million people staying subbed. It was enough in vanilla with fewer, enough in BC, and has been more then enough since. They are by no means hurting for money. You want supplementary income? They have character renames, character appearance change, server transfer, and faction change. Constantly adding new pets and mounts to the store is not warranted and trying to justify it is nothing more then a sorry attempt to make yourself feel better about spending money. They have more then enough coming in elsewhere to keep this game alive. If not, F2P games wouldn't be a thing now would they.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, stop buying into it. Stop paying for the pets so they can return to adding things to the game instead of gutting more and more features from the expansion. I mean, wheres your supplementary income when all I hear is how they can't do this, or wont add that, or are changing this or that is being delayed or pushed back or its now not guaranteed to be in at launch.</div></div><hr />

If they added actually pets and mounts to the game? that you could earn or just get in game, could buy them with, oh what is it called, IN GAME currency. but no, you are right it is only 10 dollars, like the other 10 pets for a total of 110 dollars with the soon to be added, Added with the 8 mounts of 25 dollars for a sum of 200 dollars. Yeah 310 dollars is a fair prise for mounts and pets if you want them. when you alreayd sub for it...<br />
<br />
They add plenty of pets and mounts into the game that you can earn. Most are random boss drops, rewards for killing elite bosses, or achievement based. And btw, NO ONE is forcing you to pay $310 for anything. You do NOT have to have these mounts or pets. In fact most of the mounts weren't huge sellers. Other than mount collectors, I do not see very many people who have every single mount from the Blizz Store, let alone the ugly flying goat mount. <br />
<br />
Also, if you are smart about buying the pets/ mounts, you wait for Blizzard to put them on sale. But once again, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY ANY OF THESE MOUNTS OR PETS. In fact some of the coolest looking mounts in the game are boss drops (i.e. Elegon Mount, Sha of Anger Mount, Invincible, Mimron's Head, Ashes of A'lar). So get off your high horse and wait for them to announce if they are even adding it (since this really seems like a joke to me) and if it goes cash shop, figure out if paying $10 is worth it to you. If not, don't buy it and move on.<br />
<br />
As for this post in general, as I stated above, I don't think it's real. If it's added in-game, I'll nab it only to add to my pet collection. If it's a pay to own type deal, I'll pass. Never understood people's obsessions with Corgi's.</div></div><hr />

I didn't say that. I meant that the argument is a bad one. To say that you don't have to buy something doesn't help, because it still has an effect on the game, and the way you freaked out pretty much underlined that.</div></div><hr />

So let me get this straight... you will reactivate your account to buy a pet which has no other purpose but decoration so u can do what with it? show it to your friends? Walk around the big cities/areas and display it like some type of trophie? I get that some ppl find this pet cute and thats fair enough but reactivating your account for a pet of all things... there is something horribly wrong with ppl like u and i am afraid there isn't anything or anyone in this world that can help you out :|<br />

You'll forgive me if I don't see other people spending their own money on things they like as a problem. Nobody but themselves decides whether the pet is worth it.<br />
You bring a good point when u are saying that everyone should spend their money on what they want however u are totally wrong when u are saying that this is not a problem. The more ppl buy this type of shit from the store the more items u will see hidden behind yet another pay wall. Sure it might look harmless right now but the corporate greed can easily blow this out of proportion in no time (like d3 ah for example) and before you know it u will be paying sub + the price for expansion + price for extra content for patches+ mounts pets exp/rep boosts and god knows what else from an ingame shop. So forgive us the skeptical ppl that we don't trust proven greedy corporations like blizzard :\</div></div><hr />

The only one with a problem here, must be people like YOU who act as if additional and very much optional VANITY items for a game with an extremely low subscription fee is the work of the Devil on earth and will lead to the Apocalypse, and people purchasing them are demons in disguise. Wanna enlighten us what the PROBLEM is with someone wanting to spend money on a hobbie...? It's been happening since hobbies became a thing to humans, you know. Are people spending cash on these things psychopaths? Automatically in a tight economical situation? What problems do they have exactly seeing how you seem to know people in and out based on how they feel about vanity items for a bloody game. <br />
<br />
Pathetic all around, go do something of value instead of bitching about what people wanna spend THEIR cash on. That should go for everyone each time there's a new store item that they themselves don't want/can't afford but feel the need to bitch about all the same. Get over yourselves, you won't change anything apart from maybe bringing down an intracranial hemorrhage on yourselves.</div></div><hr />

It just feels like they are trying to draw away the attention of the playerbase from the unpopular decisions they've made recently. It feels like someone at their HQ was like: &quot;Oh, the players are unhappy with the new capital hubs, the leaving of Pardo, the changes we made to the Garrisons and some other stuff, how can we soothe their minds? What do they really like? I know! Corgis! Lets give them a corgi pet! And to add some effect, make it a lava corgi! That should disctract them for a while!&quot;<br />
<br />
They keep throwing at us bones. &quot;Bones&quot; that are major-patch worth material, not an expansion-such. New pet(s), cross-faction AH, removal of guild leveling - all of these could probably be added at any given time.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
The sub still the same, expansion price can equal a new game, as every expansion could be considered a new game.<br />
<br />
And yet, some people use as an excuse how &quot;wow is already 9 years old&quot; as a justification for the major sub drop in the recent years. Double standards, eh?</div></div><hr />

It could be $20 USD. They might implement a dog post that lets other people in your party summon more stupid dogs.</div></div><hr />

The more ppl buy this type of shit from the store the more items u will see hidden behind yet another pay wall. Sure it might look harmless right now but the corporate greed can easily blow this out of proportion in no time (like d3 ah for example) and before you know it u will be paying sub + the price for expansion + price for extra content for patches+ mounts pets exp/rep boosts and god knows what else from an ingame shop. So forgive us the skeptical ppl that we don't trust proven greedy corporations like blizzard :\<br />
<br />
I suppose you have to have faith that whoever it is that makes these decisions has the rational sense not to steer the game down that path. I don't disagree that there's been a lot of stuff (I thankfully don't care much about) showing up on the store lately and I admit I can't predict how far the cash store will go - none of us can; the line may have been drawn already - but it suffices to say that if we were to reach that stage, paying extra for content patches and such, the backlash would be tremendous. They know they wouldn't be able to ignore that.</div></div><hr />
