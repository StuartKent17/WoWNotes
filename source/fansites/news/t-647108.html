Blue posts<br />
Class changes in future patches<br />
All I meant was that 3.2's list of class changes will probably be much smaller than 3.1. We will still make class changes. I was speaking more to those players who feel like they can't even get a feel for how things work because they changed in 3.0, maybe even 3.09 and 3.1. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16903571079-less-class-changes--just-big-changes.html))<br />
<br />
Patch 3.2 class changes<br />
Some classes probably do need buffs. Other players are losing some Arena matches or are not at the tops of damage meters and are laying all of the blame at our feet instead of asking if there is anything they can do better.<br />
<br />
I did say we would keep changing numbers though. My message was more for players, like the OP, who feel like they don't have a chance to get a feel for how all of the mechanics are working because they change so frequently. I would not expect that rate of change to continue. I didn't say the game was done.<br />
<br />
There are a few classes or specs that will probably continue to see more changes than others. DKs as a new class have 5 years of player history to catch up to. The Ret rotation is something we already said we'd like to evolve further.<br />
<br />
TLDR: don't expect 3.2 to have a list of class changes as epic as 3.1. Sometimes you guys make it hard to say anything because our comments are so over-interpreted. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16903630918-can-we-get-a-break-from-patches---plzzzzzzz.html))<br />

You don't need The Assembly of Iron hardmode to get to Algolon. You can do it with the Runemaster last and still have a disk drop (=&gt; gives you the quests to &quot;save&quot; the 4 watchers on hardmode - Mimiron, Hodir, Freya and Thorim).</div></div><hr />

<br />
This kill was done without any bugs or exploits!<br />
<br />
We used the most basic game mechanisms: which character can die without impacting the raid ??<br />
<br />
--&gt; pets<br />
<br />
Of course it appears easier than the brutal way (9-10k dps /player), but it is still challenging and fun.<br />
Blizz could patch the event to avoid pet tanking, but it would be another no-sense.<br />
<br />
Try it!<br />
<br />
Gabuk, raid lead<br />
<br />
Also at the end of the day who gives a whoop.<br />
Ensidia also got to Algalon by haxxor'ing on Hodir (inb4 &quot;Clever use of game mechanics&quot;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Apparently Steelbreaker won't use Overwhelming Power on pets, so by using a pet as tank you can ignore his Phase3 ability (and remove the DPS race).<br />

<br />
<br />
1) they aren't impossible.<br />
2) its 'clever use of game mechanics' i think, for now, till its fixed.<br />
3) These guilds are still in 25naxx gear.. of course they are struggling on hard mode.</div></div><hr />

So Ensidia exploiting to kill an impossible hard mode is A-OK, but if a less famous guild does it then their accomplishment is stricken from the record? Nice double standards there!<br />
Of course what's likely to happen is blizzard will simply make the debuff apply to pets without actually doing anything to tune this impossible encounter down to a sane level, leaving us with yet another undoable hard mode.</div></div><hr />

I don't get it, isn't this what everyone wanted?<br />
<br />
Random - &quot;Naxx is too easy, I'm bored&quot;<br />
Blizzard - &quot;We're making Ulduar harder&quot;<br />
Random - &quot;Ha ha, yeah right&quot;<br />
3.1 comes out<br />
Random - &quot;Ulduar is too easy&quot;<br />
Blizzard - &quot;Have you tried hard mode yet?&quot;<br />
Random - &quot;No, we've downed 3 bosses in normal (*wink*), but it's still too easy&quot;<br />

They are trying to balance out PvE and arena dps for the class, but when a class succeeds at the Arena or is OP, they nerf an aspect that directly effects their standings in PvE. As a hunter, I got my ES nerfed and now LnL is a joke in PvE, but it's balanced for the Arena as Blizzard sees it. They don't care that it's nearly a wasted talent now in raiding, but as i'm in a raiding guild and all i do is raid and never PvP, i do care. I wish they would keep PvE and PvP specs seperate.<br />

Not that it's really any consolation, but they ruined hunters in PvP too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This seems like a good guess. Health and Mana potions are both blue and red after all. Maybe it's kind of table thing that provides potions for everyone that clicks. This would further make the consumable aspect of the game simpler like they've intended. They did create Cauldrons back in BC, so this would be an extenson.<br />

Check out WoW Insider's post (http://www.wowinsider.com/2009/05/05/new-in-game-battle-bots-connected-to-mountain-dew/) on them, with matching pictures of the Game Fuel. It is most certainly connected to that. Thus, I expect these pets to only be available on North American realms, dang...<br />

Stop nerfing classes based on PvP.&quot;<br />
<br />
well for starters... in cases it has been shown that a lot of the time its the player not the classes that owns, but there are those cases that one class will top out every time to a superior player based on class and spec alone... those are the classes blizz is trying to fix... which they usually just fudge up to the point where that class is horrible. Go back a couple of patches ago like right before 3.0 came out.. ret pallies ownd just about everything in their path.. no matter their gear or wat they fought... it just was. thats not a player bets class, but class bets class. For the most part you are right, but there are those that do need to be nerfed and its not always from pvp (thats just the biggest attention getter these days), they are from exploits that they didnt think or know players would mess around with in raids and such.</div></div><hr />
