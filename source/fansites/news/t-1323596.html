Patch 5.4 - Multiple Raid Finder Queues<br />
Patch 5.4 will finally allow you to queue for multiple Raid Finder wings at once, as the string from the last PTR build hinted at: ERR_LFG_REASON_TOO_MANY_LFG - You are queued for too many instances.<br />
<br />

World PvP and Item Levels<br />
World PvP is inherently imbalanced. The reality is that a &quot;fair&quot; fight rarely happens. Someone gets the drop on the other, or is already in combat, or not at full health, or has friends with them... the list goes on. We're not convinced that gear has a terribly significant impact in the vast majority of world PvP.<br />
<br />
We're also not convinced that, even in the cases where you are on an even playing field, there's nothing you can do if you're constantly losing. World of Warcraft is an MMORPG -- a social game. Part of the point of playing on a PvP server is making friends and allies that can bail you out when you're in trouble. If you don't want to play that way, that's fine, but that's why we have PvE servers available.<br />
<br />
That said, we also get why it's frustrating when you feel like you could have beaten somebody if only you had those few extra item levels. We'd like to fix that, but it's not in the cards for 5.4. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/264867-heroic-pvp-should-be-same-ilvl-in-world/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9499900996?page=1#16))<br />

PvP<br />
how many season remains before the next expansion? 2? the season 15 is actually not in ptr but exist.<br />
We haven't decided yet. Might depend on how the 5.4 season goes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356122483293814784))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
4/12. In cataclysm each raid tier was out long enough for us to slowly work through it. Faster release in mop makes that hard<br />
Yes, this is a problem w/ faster pace. We either have to nerf content a lot or you have to move on without finishing a tier. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355777246620942339))<br />
<br />
Why shouldn't they have faster progression? In TBC, my guild was in SSC/TK when top guilds were in BT. I was fine with that.<br />
If you're talking about the same difficulty tier, sure. SSC/TK was all one difficulty. We have (Jeez) six now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357385077744877568))<br />
Honestly? That's too many. I know you're trying to cater to everyone, but it makes difficulty feel artificial.<br />
I dunno. Halo and Civilization have a lot of difficulty levels. It's a traditional inclusive mechanic. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357518959513309184))<br />
<br />
It's a bit complex as Heroics slid down in the order of progression with LFR. Some legit points I think.<br />
I often wonder if harder heroic dungeons would work if there was no matchmaking, like heroic scenarios. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355776849881726977))<br />
People are using add-ons to bypass the lack of match-making on heroic scenarios now.<br />
Are you talking like Open Raid? We dig stuff like that overall. A pug isn't random matchmaking. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356131909308399617))<br />
A pug has a leader who can invite or kick or make rules. You choose to live with that or find another group. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356132092255535105))<br />
In terms of game health, social groups &gt; pugs &gt; random matchmaking &gt; not grouping at all. That last bit is why LFR exists. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356132376365113345))<br />
<br />
I just wondering, why devs are considering 25ppls as more epic? Crowd = mess, not epic.<br />
Speaking personally, I like the fiction that the boss is so powerful that it takes a huge army of heroes to bring him or her down. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356131084431405057))<br />
<br />
I'm split when it comes to TFgear. It's just too random and can effect progression between two guilds. Otherwise yea it's good<br />
It doesn't affect progression that much. Not getting a weapon at all has a much bigger impact than someone getting a TF weapon. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351122132266262529))<br />
Thats a problem in 10 man raids. TF loots dont drop so often and when they drop sometimes no one can use it.<br />
We think that's a good thing though. Loot was more interesting when everyone didn't have the expectation of BiS every tier. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351131192055169024))<br />
In effect what your saying is that PROGRESSION (i.e loot) was more interesting when only fewer people did it<br />
No, it just felt more special to get loot when your 40 player raid got 2-3 items. The rates are like 4x that now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352112942851948547))<br />
That leads to the expectation of getting all BiS, which further makes any non BiS worth passing over instead of nice items. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352113213535551488))<br />
<br />
will there be an easy worldboss in 5.4 as well?<br />
Yes. We've tried to have an easy boss and a harder boss each patch, but Oondasta and Galleon ended up being too zergable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351119941304463360))<br />
<br />
Raid Finder<br />
Are there any plans to help remedy the issue of rampant widespread rudeness in LFR/LFG?<br />
What are you thinking? Some kind of +1 reward if a player is a decent human being? (Not joking.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350819228540084226))<br />
<br />
Do you believe making raid content accessible via LFR reduces sense of achievement, communication &amp; social skills?<br />
I think those are all downsides for LFR. Those aren't reasons to kill the feature, i.e. it has upsides too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356174038990716930))<br />
<br />
I don't think the last part is addressed by LFR in anyway. Essentially its a loot pinata with zero communication.<br />
But players are seeing the content and spending time raiding instead of not doing that. Sans LFR they'd just log out. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356171254643965952))<br />
<br />
Flex Difficulty<br />
it's fun to play palatank with haste i think all agrees but what about dps stuff that tanks take away from dps? lot of times<br />
Loot is personal in LFR and someday will be in dungeons. That just leaves organized raids, and you guys can work it out there. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352098224770789376))<br />
so you're saying flex will use normal raid loot in future? Or will it use LFR loot system.<br />
We don't know yet. Perhaps we'll let the raid leader decide which loot model to use. Flex uses LFR loot for 5.4 though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355449441769095168))<br />
I don't see there being much attraction to flex if the loot isn't even close to normal mode ilvl.<br />
If you're capable of doing Normal, than Flex really isn't targeted at you. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355485932239069184))<br />
Flex is for groups with erratic raid schedules, unstable rosters and so on. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355486036337496065))<br />
That's very sad to hear. Been doing N10 since ICC, but we value friends over progress so it's a struggle. Currently 4/16.<br />
If you value friends over progression, then you might be a good candidate for Flex. Maybe give it a shot? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355777524858499072))<br />
Flex raid is just you throwing us the leftover bones as if we were dogs.. We wanted N raiding tuned for N raiders<br />
Maybe we should rename Normal. I think some of you are getting hung up on the name. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355779213074239489))<br />
In my opinion it's that the name didn't change while N. raids now are almost like H. from Wrath.<br />
And this is where flex comes in. If you liked ICC 10s, then Flex is for you. If you liked Cataclysm 10s, then normal is for you. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355803564641234944))<br />
That isn't really true of 25s, which are about the same as they've always been. We did make 10s harder since they drop same ilvl. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355803407023472640))<br />
How do you feel that's worked out? Was it worth the cost? (eg. fractured community, no casual-mode until Flex, etc.).<br />
Not sure it was the right call TBH. Maybe the ICC model was better. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356933435794792449))<br />
<br />
How fast/slow are you planning to open Flex for SoO compared to LFR?<br />
Not sure yet. We'd like for it to be sooner though. We want flex to seem more attractive to someone on the fence. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356174175137824769))<br />
<br />
Dungeons<br />
outdoor dungeons are 1 thing I miss about classic, are the dino isle and timeless island an attempt at bringing them back?<br />
Siege was pretty much an outdoor dungeon. Or is that not what you meant? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356174307401015296))<br />
<br />
Would need options b/c folks are used to H-Dungeons for valor. Take away speed, back to Cata<br />
Right. That was the problem with Cata -- matchmaking and no alternatives. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355779862109229059))<br />
But hard+organized = loot efficient with easier+matchmaking = less loot efficient could work. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355779985182691328))<br />
<br />
you mean challenge modes?<br />
Well, Challenge Modes with gear. Random matchmaking doesn't work when tight coordination is required. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355779635188989953))<br />
<br />
If heroics are so simple, stop calling them heroics. Make 90 dungs base, add non-matchmaking heroic setting w/good items.<br />
I'm not sure either the dungeon nor raid difficulty names are good ones. But renaming them all can be pretty confusing too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355805529702014976))<br />
<br />
I know its not popular opinion, but l loved the cata heroics. Couldn't stick to std rotations.<br />
I liked Cata heroics (though a couple were still overtuned) but they worked for guilds not pugs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355804311218962433))<br />
why did you not like cata heroic randoms? You act like we just cant complete it.<br />
The success rate overall was not good. In the absence of alternatives it meant a lot of players had no content. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356130109251526657))<br />
I hoped players would rise to the occasion. Recall my &quot;dungeons are hard&quot; blog. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356130281163464705))<br />
But that was naive of me in a world of random matchmaking for hard content. The two aren't compatible. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356130470133637121))<br />
Now, a good pug with a strong leader isn't the same as random matchmaking mind you. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356130584206118913))<br />

Im also very happy about the lfr queuing. Maybe i can finally do them all without quiging because of 30 mins queues. <br />

Queue for 3 lfrs, heroic dungeon, scenario.<br />

Get into scenario instantly and complete it.<br />
Get into dungeon soon after finishing scenario.<br />
Ger into first lfr soon after finishing dungeon.<br />
Ger into second lfr.... and so on. <br />

Exactly. Nothing grasps the concept of &quot;lithe and stealthy&quot; like a cumbersome suit of armor that looks like it came out of a scrap yard.<br />

<br />
It literally looks like garbage that has been nailed together. One of the worst sets to date imo along with a lot of this tier/season. It's boring (looks like a WOTLK green set) and also very unfitting, looks like a bad warrior set with plate metal nailed randomly all over the place.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure they are now making sets look bad on purpose to make more money with store items.</div></div><hr />

This is actually one of sensei special training apparatus. Only if you can sneak in this will you be ready for the next level: clown shoes+ jingle bells in a red/neongreen suit to evolve your skills past mere mortals. Once mastered you will be the true master of stealth, only downside is that many adventurer groups wont take notice of your join applications.</div></div><hr />

Multiple Raid Finder Queue? I guess this is going to help reduce the wait times but what we really need is a way to queue for raids/dungeons with one character while playing our other characters. That way, when the raid popup comes up, we hit accept and it automatically switches us to our character that we queued with. This would be useful in so many ways and would help us advance our alts... for those of us who like to play alts. :)</div></div><hr />

What's unimportant about the armor being featured getting valid criticism that it actually doesn't look rogue like at all and pretty much SUCKS. ?</div></div><hr />

I honestly think they are trying less on purpose so that they can put all their effort into creating more attractive gear on the Blizz store.</div></div><hr />

I know it's a fantasy game and &quot;art is subjective&quot; but I do think armor sets as a whole have become more and more the target of derision and cynical jokes. <br />
<br />
Most of the earlier sets followed a strong theme for your class, now they are going for these dull colors and non-iconic looks because &quot;we don't want clown armor&quot; even though the transmog feature has been in the game for a while for that exact purpose.</div></div><hr />

It does seem that way.<br />
<br />
As much as I love my rogue in Bloodfang its over.. I want something new and not having to keep looking back for better sets from the past.<br />
I can't even begin to understand what went through their heads when considering this to be a rogue design... at best it screams hunter but even for them it's ugly.</div></div><hr />

I don't even raid anymore - but it's hilarious to me. Been reading these posts and WoW forums for months now - and it's always just a non-stop fountain of people having heart attacks because of widespread accessability. They seem to forget the other side of every coin. It's great. &quot;MY PURPLE-OUTLINED PIXELS DON'T MEAN AS MUCH AS THEY USED TO BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE HAS PURPLE-OUTLINED PIXELS, TOO...BUTHEDIDNTHAVETOWORKASHARDASMEEEE!! waaah waaaaaah...&quot; Fuckin sob story of the decade.<br />
<br />
Frankly I like where the game is at now...with the exception that there will be zero new 5man heroics to work tho for the remainder of MoP. Other than that - I enjoy not having to play WoW like a fucking job and still being able to experience raid content in some way/shape/form. Even if it does just feel like a 25m dungeon with a bunch of people who complain a lot.</div></div><hr />

So what if we are lvl 90 doing an 85 LFR and overgear it, it's not like we can do it with weeks of quetime to even get in at lvl 85 now and then expect nobody leaves for the entire instance...im kidding, nobody gets in at all.<br />
<br />
DS has some amazing blue-glow, mostly blue, gear that are amazing for transmog. This would be the only way to be able get at those gears at lvl 90, even if someone leaves it wouldn't matter since we would outgear the instance anyways n could complete it easy.<br />
<br />
Yes, I did DS LFR at 85, and it sucked to loose items to people who already had the same item, bragged how they would vendor item...and the pearl of the whole ds lfr experience was when my healing shaman lost intellect shield to a ret paladin who could roll on it also simply because he had intellect, was dps, same as elemental shamans so he fell in that category to roll on the item...and then that same person wins the 1h sword from last boss that's used for tanking and 'dps' as in frost dk's...loot distribution during cata was retarded... and I want to get items I didn't get back then...like blue glow gur'thalak 2h sword..<br />
<br />
...grrr....<br />
<br />
or...u could simply add a vendor to sell items for JP, but that would be too easy, maybe darkmoon currency like we can get Tier 0.5 transmog gears now? That would be sooo much simpler.<br />
<br />
I bring this up, because when next expansion hits, we will level and won't be able to do Lfr Mogu'shan, heart of fear, thunder dude, orgrimmar, toes n stuff.<br />
<br />
So a long-term solution would be simply a vendor, won't require much of Blizzard to add that.<br />
<br />
Lastly, it would give Darkmoon Faire some purpose again, I have all the ze pets n mounts for some time...</div></div><hr />

Lots of pallies are happy about their pve tier, also pvp (black one).<br />

So... depersonalize the dungeon experience even further? That's your answer? :|</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aliok</div><div class="date">2013-07-23, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's fun to play palatank with haste i think all agrees but what about dps stuff that tanks take away from dps? lot of times<br />
Loot is personal in LFR and someday will be in dungeons. That just leaves organized raids, and you guys can work it out there. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352098224770789376))<br />
<br />
(Emphasis mine.) Does this make anyone else concerned?<br />
<br />
Is it frustrating to lose loot to another player? It can be. But when dual spec was introduced in Wrath, players on my server came to the understanding that there really wasn't such a thing as an &quot;off-spec&quot; anymore. If you need it, you Need it was essentially the rule. If I was concerned about loot being &quot;ninja'd&quot; then I asked my guild to run the dungeon with me.<br />
<br />
How would personal loot in a dungeon even work? Would there be bonus rolls? Would a player be guaranteed an item that is useful to their spec or just to their class? Or would it just be a chance of a gear item, and consolatory items like gold or crafting mat or...?<br />
<br />
Getting loot from a pop-up box just isn't the same experience even if the underlying RNG mechanism is relatively the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, that Rogue set... that's not armor, that's scrap metal and leather rags stapled together. And who needs to see with both eyes anyway? It seems strangely familiar, too.</div></div><hr />

The system they have now is too bloated and not intuitive and it's frustrating the players, as well as leading to undesirable consequences. I get what they're going for with flex, I'm part of a small guild myself and now we just team up to do LFR together. If I was to pitch an idea to Blizz it would be to work really hard on the flex tech to see if it could ever be feasible just having Heroic Flex, Normal Flex, and LFR 25.</div></div><hr />
