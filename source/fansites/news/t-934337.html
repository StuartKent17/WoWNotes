The progression from the past 24H leaves us with only 5 guilds that managed to kill at least 5 bosses out of the 7 available in the Firelands.<br />

Play Nice; Play Fair<br />
With Season 9 recently passed, new PvP rewards distributed, and Season 10 now underway, we’d like to remind everyone about the importance of fair play. To be clear, cheating is not tolerated in World of Warcraft, and exploitation of ranked PvP play is no exception. Before distributing rewards to the top performers in Season 9, we conducted a thorough sweep looking for any players or teams that were clearly attempting to manipulate the ladder system. These players were dealt with accordingly and did not receive any undue rewards. It’s important to note, however, that there are many cases where it may appear that players have manipulated the system, when they in fact were legitimately competing like most everyone else. We not only want to make sure our actions are comprehensive -- we must make sure they’re accurate.<br />
<br />
That said, we’ll continue to ensure fair play is taking place going forward, and will be implementing changes to our matchmaking rating system soon to resolve this type of ladder system manipulation.<br />
<br />

Recruit-A-Friend Program Levels Up to 80<br />
Blizzard finally announced the change to RAF officially (with more than a single line in a patch note). <br />
The Recruit-A-Friend feature offers amazing perks to World of Warcraft players who ask a friend to join them in their adventures through Azeroth. With the 4.2 patch we’ve made the rewards even better, as you can now reap the benefits while leveling all the way to 80.<br />
<br />
When you recruit a friend to play World of Warcraft, you’ll be able to send them a unique referral key. When they use this specific trial key to activate a new account, you’ll both receive a number of perks to help you level up together.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Worried about spending a long time leveling up? No problem! You and your recruit you will gain triple experience while partied, up to level 80.<br />
Even if you don’t have as much time to play as your recruit, they’ll be able to help you catch up. For every two levels a recruit character earns, they'll gain one &quot;grantable&quot; level. Recruit characters can then grant these levels to your lower level veteran character.<br />
You won’t have to worry about getting separated; you’ll be able to summon one another to each other's locations from anywhere in the game.<br />
You’ll receive a credit for 30 days of free game play for each recruit you refer who upgrades to a retail version of World of Warcraft and subscribes.<br />
Once one of your recruits has paid for 60 days of game time you’ll be able to send an X-53 Touring Rocket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/54860/x-53-touring-rocket/) to any of your characters! The X-53 is a unique flying mount able to carry a passenger, and only available from Recruit-A-Friend.<br />
<br />
<br />
For a full rundown on each of these features, requirements, and limitations, hit the Recruit-A-Friend FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=20588). You can also run through a visual guide (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=26269) of the referral process, as well as how to redeem your X-53 Touring Rocket (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=26269).<br />

Spell effects visuals and Divine Aegis<br />
Something we’ve been hearing for a couple of years from players is that our spell effects, which are typically designed to look awesome when used all by themselves, create an undecipherable visual cacophony when used in large group settings, such as raids or Battlegrounds. In Cataclysm, we made a major effort to reduce the visual impact on targets that were being bombarded with multiple spells at once. For example, some visuals that looked cool (but weren’t really conveying any useful information that the group needed to know) scaled up way too large on bosses. Moonfire and Incinerate are two examples of spells that had this problem, and were changed for Cataclysm. We also offered a nifty UI option called “Emphasize my spell visuals” which still makes your spells look awesome to you, but slightly diminishes the visuals being produced by the rest of your group. After all, isn’t it most important that *you* look amazing?<br />
<br />
That option, by the way, can be found in-game by going to Esc|Interface|Display.<br />
<br />
With the visual spam on enemy targets relaxed a bit, we then turned to the visual spam on friendly targets. Some spells, and heals were particularly guilty of this, had a lot of visual flourishes that looked awesome, but were simply overwhelming when layered on top of all of the other visual commotion going on in an encounter. Two spells we changed at the last minute were Divine Light and Divine Aegis. To use the particular example of Divine Aegis, the visual wasn’t too bad when it was only created by infrequent crits, but once we allowed Prayer of Healing to always cause Divine Aegis, the flashes on the screen became distracting and obscured the view of what was actually happening in the fight. If you want to see this for yourself, check out some pre-4.2 raid videos.<br />
<br />
We changed Divine Aegis very late in the 4.2 patch cycle, so we used the temporary solution of using the Power Word: Shield impact, which is much less prominent. A more permanent solution will be to get a new visual for Divine Aegis that is unique but doesn't go too far, or perhaps distinguish between the shields caused by crits and the heals caused by Prayer of Healing. We recognize that there is some visual information conveyed by Divine Aegis (for example, you may want to dispel Power Word: Shield but not Divine Aegis) and we totally agree that the new (temporary) visual is not as cool as the older one. We’re looking into some other solutions as well as we strive to find a balance between making your spells look flashy while still having a battle that is possible to comprehend by, you know, actually looking at it.

Two-Hand Weapons too small?<br />
We discussed this with the developers yesterday. It seems some of the two-handed weapons are getting smaller, while the one-handed weapons are getting bigger. We like the basic idea of players being able to tell what kind of weapon a character is holding just by looking at them. There should be no visual confusion between a one-handed weapon and a two-handed weapon.<br />
<br />
It's not likely there will be any major art updates coming before the next patch, but this is definitely something for us to keep in mind going forward.

Guilds going through Firelands Raid encounter in 2 weeks<br />
I am endlessly intrigued to find players judging the difficulty of the encounters and how long lived the content is by how pro players, some of the most skilled and focused players in the world, engage the content. It's a little like judging the difficulty of juggling eight chainsaws by what the best jugglers in the world can accomplish. Sure, it might be easy for them, but when was the last time you tried it? (Do not attempt to juggle eight chainsaws. Do not attempt to juggle any chainsaws. Unless you are a juggler. A professional chainsaw juggler. A really, really good professional chainsaw juggler who does not fear chainsaw manglings.)<br />
<br />
The content wasn't designed to be 'quick'. It was designed to be epic, engaging, challenging and fun. It can accomplish those goals without being punishing.<br />
<br />
It is kind of remarkable how fun and engaging the content can be when we start judging content by what we accomplish and experience ourselves, rather than the posts we read on the forums or the headlines of a fansite.

World of Warcraft Documentary - The Raid<br />
The Raid (http://jointheraid.com/) got quite a lot of attention a few months back when they started funding their project on Kickstarter (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theraid/the-raid-promo). After filming over 18 TB of video, months of intensive work, and not a lot of sleep, it is almost ready and will be released in a couple of weeks! <br />
<br />
The documentary will be shown to the public during a live stream event and we will have more details on that later, for the time being, I will leave you with the first trailer. <br />

Maybe it's a great piece of artwork and cinematography and a good documentary, but damn they failed to make it current/new/up-to date content. I for one don't want to see some random people raiding ICC that youtube is filled with if they were not Ensidia or Paragon going for world firsts.<br />

Two-Hand Weapons too small?<br />
We discussed this with the developers yesterday. It seems some of the two-handed weapons are getting smaller, while the one-handed weapons are getting bigger. We like the basic idea of players being able to tell what kind of weapon a character is holding just by looking at them. There should be no visual confusion between a one-handed weapon and a two-handed weapon.<br />
It's not likely there will be any major art updates coming before the next patch, but this is definitely something for us to keep in mind going forward.<br />
<br />
Um, what exactly do they need to discuss?<br />
Its just about increasing the model size, not enlarging their mportant organisms that requires a team of elite ;surgeons.</div></div><hr />

Actually you can extend the raid if you want :D.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm also dissapointed about the speed. Although they do have 372 gear which is probably fine for first 4 bosses in hc mode and overgearing for normal modes. + they have practised it in ptr so they have played more than 3 days actually.<br />

Well I doubt blizz with nerf the bosses :D. Some of you should be happy about that. Lets see how hard ragnaros will be.</div></div><hr />

Mainly because it's not about the &quot;pros&quot;. It's about people a lot like me. I'll admit, if it wasn't for the 4-5 other people that've formed the core of the 10 man raid I've been in for the past 3+ years, I'd probably have quit a long time ago. I don't know how fulfilling it'd be if we one-shot every boss. Not much. Anything gained without much effort just wouldn't really be worth the effort. Nothing is more satisfying than a boss kill after many attempts, when everyone finally &quot;gets&quot; it and the big bad falls over dead.</div></div><hr />

unless I have missed something there is option to extend raid so you can continue from your current boss instead of spending time killing earlier bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was actually the other way around, when guilds like Method and Inner Sanctum were sleeping, Paragon was raiding in the morning, catching up. I guess that's a perk of having such a big roster, no sleep, just switch new people in.</div></div><hr />

&quot;As DREAM Paragon, or equivalently 梦想 Paragon, we will continue our journey with even greater motivation than before. We'll do our best to fight for the number one spot, and at the same time be a worthy competitor to the other top guilds, without whom there would be no race.

The real big deal is Raggi-HC (worldfirst) and the race is still on. Currently Paragon and Method are the only ones on par and im sure both will push it to the limit for the firstkill. It is only a matter of time and the first guild who kills him deserve the number one spot.Cheers, just my 2 cents(and as german, i still hope FTH sacrifices enough goats and kill him first) :cool:</div></div><hr />

This might be just a game but so is ice hockey pr formulas and running is running and walking is walking and still people care who is first and who is not. ANd considering we have 10 million players I would say this isn't some &quot;small&quot; competition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, what kind of utter idiots work for Blizzard and where the hell are they getting their information, if their source told them that Divine Aegis was too obstructive and distracting. Have they even seen the animation? Compared to it, anti magic field, spirit link totem, holy word sanctuary, mushrooms, tranquility and a lot of other spells should be causing ceizures on a daily basis yet I don't see that happening. I bet if you ask most people they won't even know what the Divine Aegis animation was, to start with, but hey, someone watched a pre-4.2 raid video with bad quality and came to the conclusion that it is too much.<br />
<br />
This whole sudden change after so much time of Divine Aegis having one of *the* best animations in game just shows that someone in Blizzard truly has no idea what they are doing. If this change really was intentional and that whole blue post (which was just so ridiculous that I'm starting to think the blue was trolling us) wasn't a bunch of crap which actually translates into ''We have no idea what happened and it's actually an oversight but let's pretend it's not'', then Blizz has really taken like 5 steps backward. As someone said, pants-on-head retarded.^^ First the ''not oversight but it actually is'' with the whole (lack of) spirit cloth in Firelands, now DA animation change. Are suddenly baboons working as the priest team @ Blizzard?</div></div><hr />

That's not really true. At 0 Haste, it grants an additional 1% (1.00 x 1.01= 1.01), but as you gain Haste that changes. At 10% Haste, the Goblin Racial grants 1.1% Haste (1.10 x 1.01= 1.111), at 20% Haste it gives 1.2% Haste (1.20 x 1.01= 1.212) and so forth. The only time Haste is additive is when you're dealing with rating, anything percentage based is multiplicative.</div></div><hr />

Paragon cleared all heroic tier 11 content on January 24th. Six months later only 1.34% of all raiding guilds have cleared all heroic tier 11 content for 10 or 25 man. The same thing happened with heroic LK in tier 10. Paragon had him down in April. By the time 4.0 was released in October (6 months later) there was still only about 1% of the raiding community that had downed 25 man heroic LK. See a pattern here? These guys are professional gamers and only accept the best and most innovative players in the world into their guilds. It doesn't really matter how fast they are able to clear content since obviously 99% of the rest of the world is still not able to recreate their feats 6 months after Paragon has had all content on farm. I guarantee 6 months from the world first heroic Ragnaros kill there will still only be about 1% of the raiding community that has killed him.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's a great piece of artwork and cinematography and a good documentary, but damn they failed to make it current/new/up-to date content. I for one don't want to see some random people raiding ICC that youtube is filled with if they were not Ensidia or Paragon going for world firsts.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's ICC because it was filmed during ICC (if the big &quot;In 2010&quot; didn't clue you off in the beginning). Unless you want to watch crappy Youtube clips with no editing and no quality control, you're gonna get old content. If you don't want to watch it, then don't. <br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to it. It seems interesting. <br />
<br />
As far as content bitching goes, why do people consistently act surprised that the top guilds blow through the content so quickly? It's only happened everytime there was a new raid released.

<br />
Lol. Your replies are retarded. STARS whine because the patch updates to TW is unfair for people that want to compete for world firsts. STARS have the potential and the passion to do so but many times they were stalled by alot later server patches than US and EU. And EU are complaining that we are one day behind..<br />
<br />
And if you think the only concept to raiding is killing a boss for gear you are clearly a scrub and you probably only raid normal mode even though you raid 5 days a week. Raiding is so much more than gear. In my opinion gear is the last thing prioritized for me out of three things: 1. The thrill of killing a boss after trying to kill it for several weeks. That's optimal atleast, I don't want a boss to get killed after 2 days like the current Firelands is. That's why I and so many othes loved Ulduar. It was a challenge, and the thrill of killing Freya+3 for the first time, Yogg+1 for the first time and Algalon and last bot not least Mimiron HM was so amazing that I still back at ICC level found it challenging to do in pugs with 2 tiers better gear than when it was current.<br />
<br />
2. The social part of being in a guild with quite good friends that rely on each others to achieve a certain goal that also when not focusing their asses of for progressing have a really good times on trash or farm bosses, resulting in several laughs per evening.<br />
<br />
3. Gear, it is merely a small little boost to easier achieving your goals of killing bosses. As mentioned before Ulduar Hard modes for the Iron drake for example, the pugs that did them back in ICC still had a very hard time killing bosses like Freya+3 as well as Yogg-Saron+1. Epic fights as Mimiron where fire was a really big part was redundant in ICC gear, but still pugs failed because of the lack of good coordination.<br />
<br />
That is why I raided. Challenging encounters that are still hard the next tier, because the mechanics don't merely rely on your gear for higher HPS/DPS/HP. To down bosses we fought hard for. The immense joy of at least 25 people, mostly 30, after the boss was killed. The gear we got was mostly just to faster kill the farm bosses so we could have more hours practicing on the progress bosses. Because as soon as we got them down as an effect of practicing and perfecting the tactics and the execution, the next week they got killed after just a few tries. And I promise you, ten pieces of gear don't fucking make a boss 5 times easier the next week, Skill and execution combined with good tactics do.<br />
<br />
I've stopped raided now over the summer, I might not come back. That is because apart from hardcore raiding wow simply isn't very amusing anymore. It's just farming pvp gear in bg's you have played for 4 years. Doing arena in the same arenas you've played for 3 years, only to meet the same team at higher rating because they are the favorable setup for that season. Daily quest for achievements get boring when you only do reputation achievements, how much I do love to see that little achievement popping up. Farming stuff for 10 minutes a day for 4 weeks to get it(and the travel to the place takes atleast 30 minutes one way) simply just is retarded and a way for blizzard to milk your money out of you... I'd rather do dailies for 3 hours per day for a week because I have time rather than do it 30 minutes per day and sit there bored the other 2½ hours doing nothing but Sit in Orgrimmar listening to Spotify/watching Youtube. Just because some dad doesn't have time for that doesn't mean it should be reduced to make them happy. If they can only do dailies for 30 minutes per day, then they can do 1/4 of the dailies for 30 minutes but for several weeks instead. And let us who have the time do things for longer...<br />
So in the end raiding was the only part I played wow for, then my guild broke up after 6 years(Even though I only had been in it for 1-2 months) and after just getting into a new guild and it gettin groken up I really couldn't be arsed to look for a new guild where I had to have 100% attendence to get fancied rather than 90%. And joining a new guild for a brand new tier over the summer was not something I was keen on at that time. Also I didn't think either 4.1 or 4.2 would be especially good nor long lasting, only farm after farm after farm. And so far I seem to be wronged. After half a week only one boss remains for the top guilds to down. It took 3 months or so for the first guild in the world to kill Yogg-saron+0, half of the time until the next tier patch. Not 2 weeks, one eighth(if Blizz puts new patches out every 4 months instead of 6 as they say they will, which I do not believe) of the time.<br />
<br />
Raids as Black temple, Sunwell and Ulduar will not come for a long long time(ICC was not very awesome except LK, Sindragosa and Putricide, 3 out of 12 bosses). Times such as when Karazhan, the first tier, was raided every week by casuals while hardcores raided black temple and Sunwell, the last tier will not either come back. Casuals want current content and every bosses down NOW. They aren't satisfied with doing the last tier because that is were their skill level belong. They want what the hardcores have without possessing the same skills or abilities as hardcores have.<br />
<br />
That is why my time with WoW most likely is over, and Firelands is just further proving it as of this moment.<br />
As a sidenote. I was at 8/13 bosses when I stopped raiding 4 months ago. If I had joined a Guild instead of quitting I would have applied for Immersion on Auchindoun, or Whatever if I wasn't accepted into Immersion. Guilds that are at 3/7 and 1/7.<br />
So I am not some scrub that tries to stand above other people while he/she is not. Because I have been in good guilds that are very good at killing hard bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Pretty much what this guy said.<br />
<br />
Documentaries, and films have 3 phases. When do you think all the films you see this summer were filmed? It was usually the year before. They probably got the idea for the doc sometime during the beginning of WotLK. <br />
<br />
So then you need to find funding, come up with a LONG list of people to interview and/or find a guild that will allow unlimited access. Not sure how long this film is going to be but then there's shooting ratios. Documentaries are notorious for shooting WAY more footage than you'll ever actually see in the finished project. This includes things like multiple takes, etc. Stanley Kubrick is known to have shot 500:1 ratio for some of his films. So, for a 2 hr movie he shot 1000 hours of footage. Imagine that bonus disc.<br />
<br />
Then comes the process of editing and picking through all the stuff you shot and trying to make something watchable (won't put you to sleep because it's WAY too long) and interesting. There are so many decisions you can make with editing that can completely change how your final product turns out. Back in film school, in one editing class we had different groups edit together a short scene with identical footage... needless to say, every single submission was COMPLETELY different. <br />
<br />
I think it looks great and can't wait to see it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is only partially true. While yes, the bosses were on the PTR at some point. Most of them were only tested for a few hours. They schedule that way so that the Blizz devs can actively watch the testing and tweak it as needed, sometimes in the middle of a pull. <br />
<br />
I don't really raid anymore, but I am seeing more and more guilds recruiting saying they are already 6/7 normals. It is one thing for top guilds to be already through content it is another for all other guilds to be mostly through normals in two weeks.</div></div><hr />

Okay then, so what's the &quot;right&quot; amount of time needed for top tier guilds to clear an instance? If you wanted these to be hard enough that it takes them a lot longer, you'd probably be the first one to post here saying Firelands is too difficult for your guild (if you even raid).<br />

And still WoWprogress got Paragon first (yeah it's typical since they got same progress) and Method second...right...<br />
<br />
It's based on the time from the last kill. 6 hours after the first person kills a boss the points decay, this allows people a window of human error in keeping pace. (power outages, isp problems, server problems ect)</div></div><hr />

It's ICC because it was filmed during ICC (if the big &quot;In 2010&quot; didn't clue you off in the beginning). Unless you want to watch crappy Youtube clips with no editing and no quality control, you're gonna get old content. If you don't want to watch it, then don't. <br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to it. It seems interesting. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty much what this guy said.<br />
<br />
Documentaries, and films have 3 phases. When do you think all the films you see this summer were filmed? It was usually the year before. They probably got the idea for the doc sometime during the beginning of WotLK. <br />
<br />
So then you need to find funding, come up with a LONG list of people to interview and/or find a guild that will allow unlimited access. Not sure how long this film is going to be but then there's shooting ratios. Documentaries are notorious for shooting WAY more footage than you'll ever actually see in the finished project. This includes things like multiple takes, etc. Stanley Kubrick is known to have shot 500:1 ratio for some of his films. So, for a 2 hr movie he shot 1000 hours of footage. Imagine that bonus disc.<br />
<br />
Then comes the process of editing and picking through all the stuff you shot and trying to make something watchable (won't put you to sleep because it's WAY too long) and interesting. There are so many decisions you can make with editing that can completely change how your final product turns out. Back in film school, in one editing class we had different groups edit together a short scene with identical footage... needless to say, every single submission was COMPLETELY different. <br />
<br />
I think it looks great and can't wait to see it!<br />
<br />
The movie was already aired !!! Last year ! To only a select few ... I wanted to see the movie last year ! <br />
Since then I saw lots of ICC videos, saw Paragon's and others' videos, I saw Lore's streams live http://www.justin.tv/devolore/ ... And there ain't no company that is releasing a screening for cinema, is a guy with his friends that have some cinematography knowledge.<br />
For the WoW fans he could have released the movie a year ago ... for the masterpiece of a documentary that he wants to go to festivals and Cannes or whatever he can stay in post-production 'til Titan comes out, to me it's outdated.<br />
It's just took too long !</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is because even thought Method killed 5/7 first, DREAM Paragon killed Majordomo Staghelm first, giving them 6/7 before Method. Since they are still at 6/7, this means Paragon are actually ahead of Method in progress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone with the same chances? The PTR is open for anyone that wants to download it. If you choose not to download the PTR that doesn't mean you didn't have the opportunity, you simply chose not to take it.

I would put them up there with 6/7 (Method/Paragon) if they had their reset on Wednesday like them.<br />
<br />
<br />
OT: It looks like NONE of the TW guilds are updating on wowprogress. May we be in for a shock kill from STARS?<br />

It seems as taiwanese servers don't have nothing related to patch 4.2 updated on Armory.<br />

bloodfyr is actually articulating our journey in a rather accurate fashion. The &quot;pre-screening&quot; event we held at Blizzcon last year was in order to drum up interest and support for our work. Since that time, we have finished production and post and are excited to show the full film to the public for the first time. <br />
<br />
When we set out to execute this film, we wanted to capture progression on an end-expansion boss. If you think about it, the Lich King is as contemporary as it gets :). <br />
<br />
I wish making quality films was an easier effort, but that just isn't the case. The effort is gargantuan. This film is pretty special, however, because it was made possible by individuals like yourself who wanted to see it come about. We are excited to finally share it with the public and are anxious to hear your thoughts on whether we have succeeded in our task to communicate the experience of raiding to a world that might not know it exists. <br />

If you took a moment to stop whining long enough to realize what I just pointed out then perhaps you would feel differently. Guess why that is hardly possible in EU. There is only one PTR available for several countries. The normal lag is bad enough there. Its just a fact that not everyone can test because the server can only handle a certain amount of players. And I´m not complaining or whining about the current system. I chose not to spoil the fun for me by not going on the PTR. I want to experience the less buggy bosses when they are done because I dont have any presure like the world first guilds. All I´m pointing out is that I would look forward to a patch with content without players being able to test it before it goes live. (And to laugh at blizzard for being unable to do such a patch because they dont have the ability to test it. ;))<br />

You do know that blizzard only changes the words yards to meters or whatever system you or your client is using? Otherwise everyone could just change the client to the needed language and profit from it. Everyone has the same range whatever system you see on your char.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what i've read elsewhere, it's a German guild that have been in the top 100 (either EU or World i don't know) for quite some time, but they are quite a surprise.<br />
<br />
The real problem with FL isn't that some guilds are at nearly 7/7hc after less than 2 days of raiding (for the EU guilds, 3 days for the US ones) but that there is ALREADY 1600+ guilds with 7/7 in less than 2 lockouts AND more than 3200 with 6/7 or something like that.<br />
<br />
It means than in 2 weeks there is nearly more guilds that have completed normal content for T12 than there is guilds that have done the same for T11 in 8months.....<br />
<br />
That is a shame and it's not normal for content that comes out once in a blue moon (when it's not pushed back multiple times again). :(<br />
<br />
(i'm not really taking into account the shitload of guilds that have finished clearing normal content and part of hm T11 since the 4.2 patch that nerfed it to the 666th limbo of Hell :D)</div></div><hr />

He has to be joking. It reminds me of a few healers who used to stack &quot;hit&quot;, and I'm not talking for CC reasons either. They actually thought it made their heals hit more.</div></div><hr />

I disagreed with Blizz from the start though; you can make 7 bosses that are more complicated than the 13 from the previous tier, but it's still only 7 bosses you have to learn tactics for. Facesmashing for kills is much easier when there are less bosses.</div></div><hr />
