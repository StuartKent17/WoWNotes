Arenas Temporarily Disabled<br />
Oh well, this patch is getting interesting. Make sure you check the original post (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/14498162544-arenas-temporarily-disabled.html) for future updates. For the moment this is only affecting US realms. <br />
We have temporarily disabled all Arena matches while we investigate current rating calculation discrepancies. Further updates will be provided once we have additional information to share. <br />
<br />
Wintergrasp issues update<br />
We have found a solution for instability issues that were occurring in Wintergrasp. In order for this fix to go out to all realms, we will be issuing rolling restarts during off peak hours. Once the rolling restarts have concluded we will continue to monitor Wintergrasp and realm stability closely. <br />
<br />
Warlock pet health buff<br />
To get the intended result, we are going to hotfix a change to increase the health that all warlock pets gain from the warlock's stamina. Depending on your stamina and talents, you should see all of your pets go up by a few thousand health. As one example, a felhunter with 8000 health should go up to about 14,000 health. Felguards and voidwalkers will have more. Imps and succubi less. Doomguard and infernals will jump by a lot.<br />
<br />
This change should go through any minute. <br />
<br />
Patch deployment and bug fixes<br />
Yes, bugs are bugs. It is not necessarily the most efficient way to get them fixed to mention them in the role forums, though I note them when I see them. We actually have a pipeline in place in the bug forum to make sure those issues get to the proper people. I don't mind you bringing up bugs in here though, especially when they color perceptions or have huge effects on class balance.<br />
<br />
As for why we can't always fix bugs in a timely fashion, it's just the nature of software development. Sometimes it is technically difficult. Sometimes getting the bug to reproduce consistently is a challenge so we can't isolate what is causing it. Sometimes the change is so risky that it is better to live with the bug for the time being. Sometimes we need new tech to fix the bug and that time might even come at the expense of a more important feature. Several of the bugs we introduced in 3.0.8 were things that were working perfectly on our servers or in some cases even on the PTR. What happened to them in between that and live deployment? (I actually know the answer in most cases, but I'm trying to illustrate what happens in developing a game as large and complex as WoW.)<br />
<br />
I don't mean to suggest that we don't test our content. We do and we have an oustanding QA department. Almost all software has bugs, especially complex applications. I am perhaps more forthcoming about the state of the game than you are used to, which may make it appear that we have more problems than we used to. But I don't honestly think that is the case. I remember how insane patch day has always been, especially a patch of this magnitude. <br />
<br />
[...]This was a massive patch in terms of number of changes. It fixed several hundred bugs of all sorts. They are not all reported in the patch notes or the patch notes would be pretty unreadable.<br />
<br />
Ulduar is a large patch from a gigabyte perspective, but that is mostly art. It will have many class changes too of course.<br />

Then again, we were playing around 1950-2000 and were getting the team rating we expected. (between 5-12 per match). Personal rating was climbing much faster and as we hit 2016, personal hit 2195. <br />
<br />
Maybe only US arenas are bugged?</div></div><hr />

It was a poorly tested patch. Each time I was on the ptr there were on average 8-10 people in Dalaran, maybe double that in the other major cities (total) using test dummies, noone in Naxx, noone doing arena, noone in wintergrasp. I'm really not surprised there are this many problems, there were a lot of changes for a 'minor' patch.<br />
<br />
Also, perhaps it was an addon i was using on the PTR that was disabling it.. but I saw no feedback back button that is normally there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anything Blizzard could do to fix PVP issues would only make PVE slightly, and ever so slightly, harder (read: more fun) by reducing the burst dps of a few classes. Which you should find is actually a good thing because not only has PVE never really been all that hard, at this point in the game it's never been easier. PVP is the only aspect of this game that requires well rounded player skill. Remember Teron Gorefiend? how many times did your guild wipe because a certain 5 people couldnt kill their constructs, but would get lucky after a few tries where none of those 5 people got shadow of death? I bet those same 5 people were there when you killed Illidan too... And how about on Twins when someone didnt run out of the group with conflagrate? Or someone attacked the sheeped targets on Muru? If anything, the overwhelming PVE influence is what Blizzard is far too concerned with, given that they still haven't done all that they should to fix arenas. You can ask your friendly warlock about that, though. I suppose my point is that there's no reason to QQ over the easiest part of this game. <br />

Look at this patch for example, they changed/nerfed so many DK abilities because of PvP, while they were totally fine in PvE. It goes two ways, but often it's PvP having issues and PvE being affected by it.<br />
<br />
On topic, this patch is poor. Lag is unbearable in all raid instances. WG is disabled and permanently owned by the horde on my server. Wonder what else they can break.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LoL, as if PvP is harder... check class, check skills used, remember CDs, use the right counter skills, GG. Looks like PvE to me.<br />
<br />
And Burst damage was always more PvP oriented than PvE.<br />
<br />
Sustained DPS &gt; Burst/&quot;Lucky&quot; DPS on PvE. Hello DW &gt; one hand/2Hander on every melee class that can use it? Remember Fury Warrior for PvE, Arms for PvP? Only recently (3.0) that they're trying to make burst classes competitive on DPS against sustained classes for PvE. Be it by increasing the burst damage or, actually, removing most of the burst from the spec in exchange for more sustained damage like they're doing with Ret Paladins and &quot;soon&quot; Arms Warriors.<br />
<br />
Anything that blizzard does to fix PvP, makes PvE easier buddy, they can't hold on spells that now are totally nerfed because of not &quot;PVP&quot;, but ARENAS, to create a more complex content and we keep going.<br />
<br />
And just because WoW is a PvE/&quot;large scale PvP&quot; game, not a small scale PvP like the Arena and Duel models, that explains a lot on why arenas always have huge balance/comp problems.</div></div><hr />

I didn't see any huge PR issues, but initially everything was messed up, so that was probably when it happened<br />
Org arena is (was?) better now, except for the fact you can walk right out of the starting gate<br />
WG was great before it was disabled, farming honor was nice<br />

Both sides suck in their way. It's stupid enough to argue about skill in PvE and then<br />
compare it to Raidbosses. Really, is there ANYTHING which is the same in both<br />
situations besides of the griefing for loot and killing &quot;something&quot;?<br />
<br />
And if you say &quot;olol in PvE everything gets announced and stuff!!!1&quot;<br />
Yeah, true. But to compensate this there are most likely several actions<br />
at the same time and they do a &quot;tiny bit&quot; more damage than a mage's frostnova.<br />
And no, you are NOT nuking a player with his 20-25k Life, you actually have<br />
to get down some million HP down to zero.<br />

I just got hugely nerfed as a hunter in PVP because you PVE tards put out to much dmg!? Seriously though ive been a raider for years and enjoyed being server 1st in MH and BT on my server, but to be quite honest with you.. PVE doesnt require a whole lot of skill, and atm the DMG isnt as important as it used to be with these new heroics and instances. Ive been able to do em with my lvl 70 pvp set just fine upon release.<br />
<br />
Heres an idea! What about... if ppl who enjoy PVE all get free transfers to an PVE server and get balanced around PVE, en ppl who enjoy PVP go to an PVP server and get balanced around PVP. That way we can all stop QQing.. maybe</div></div><hr />

errm, did i miss something? how is it possible to have such high ratings when you only win about 66% of the games? am i n00b and should read the way to calculate ratings? or did some stuff change in wotlk?<br />
<br />
oh and to prove my n00bness : i never got higher than 1750 rating in arena (tbc).. rofl omg n00b<br />

<br />
There is one solid fact that pretty much proves which is &quot;harder.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anybody that wants to raid, can do it easily and kill bosses.<br />
Anybody that wants to arena, can do it but doesn't necessarily do well.<br />
<br />
I choose to do arenas with a not-so-optimal setup, because I think it is more fun. Sure, I'm a DK...but playing with a Hunter in 2s isn't exactly the best comp. Both of us have huge burst, but more often than not, it turns out being me vs. 2. I could play with a pally and faceroll my way to the top, but that really isn't rewarding at all.<br />
<br />
I like the DBM comparison for raids vs. arenas. Locust swarm? Are you kidding me? Move to the center of the room for a few seconds, how is that even remotely challenging? The hardest things in Naxx are making the jump to Thaddius, and Frogger.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mind flay does too much damage? Hotfixed within HOURS! <br />

Yeah, its not hard to isolate something that is...already isolated. Try to understand programming somewhat before complaining about the way Blizzard does something.</div></div><hr />

Anybody that wants to raid needs about 9 other people, or 24 other people (yes i know...not necessarily...but don't be a penny-pincher please :) ), and that's (in my opinion) an aspect that needs not to be neglected.The more people are involved, the more possible sources for errors are present.

<br />
<br />
this is very true!!<br />
<br />
above poster...<br />
<br />
a few things about arena and raid:<br />
<br />
raids:<br />
1. you know what enemy you will be facing so you know his tricks<br />
2. you can tool your group for that<br />
3. eventhough healers and tanks have a tough job, dps is easy as hell (im dps so i know it)<br />
<br />
arena:<br />
1. you dont know what you will face, so when it begins, you have to be able to quickly coordinate and adept<br />
2. you cannot tool your group for the enemy you will face (since you dont know who it will be)<br />
<br />
and most important:<br />
raid ALWAYS drops loot...<br />
in arena, you need a specific rating to get &quot;loot&quot;.. since it costs lots of honor/arena points, you need to win quite some arena points, 3 weeks in a row, just to get 1 single arena item.. without improving your gear<br />
the heroics you can do daily, so able to get better loot every day<br />
<br />
you are talking ab out that EVERYONE get do arena.. jup (same as raid), <br />
but as long as you dont win, you;ll never get that sweet loot...<br />
<br />
when failing a raid, you can get some new healers or players (kick the n00bs) and try again.. hell you can even try 100x to kill that boss.. in arena.. the fight is over in 2, 3 minutes , without ANY chance to redo it...<br />
<br />
to not get b¡tchslepped by you PVE guys, i'll say this:<br />
<br />
PVE and PVP skills are not comparable, its totaly different<br />
<br />
my heart (and brains) say:<br />
arena is way harder than raiding<br />
<br />
I;ve done most raid content in tbc (pre-nerf) in my pvp gear, owning pve dps peepz (who werent that bad, but apparently also not too good ;))<br />
<br />
when i have bad gear, i can get carried by a group with good gear.. in arena, if 1 of the teammembers has average or bad gear, he;ll die instantly....<br />
<br />
so... imo comparing naxx with a 1300 rating is actually the closest thing to the truth i;ve ever heard hehe</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fr0hzn</div><div class="date">2009-01-22, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You hurt my feelings :'(<br />
<br />
I've never said that naxx is challenging. Never.<br />
Naxx is even lower than &quot;1330 rating lulz&quot; (in PvP grammar).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Windywoo</div><div class="date">2009-01-22, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anybody that wants to raid, can do it easily and kill bosses.<br />
Anybody that wants to arena, can do it but doesn't necessarily do well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only since they dumbed Naxx down to the lowest common denominator. Why did so few guilds clear BT and MH or Sunwell before they removed attunements and nerfed them?<br />
<br />
Anyone who wants to do well in Arena can roll fotm and do well, maybe not top, but its at least as hard to get 2k rating with an OP combo as it is to clear a pre-wotlk raid.<br />
<br />
PvE might not test reactions as well as a good Arena team, but it does test other things like your patience and ability to play as a team. And I am not talking about the 5 man nonsense in Arena either, I'm talking about getting along with your guild, being able to turn up at the required time, realise that a lot of people are relying on you, being willing to respec if the fight requires it, farming the right consumables, gear etc.<br />
<br />
Arena requires that you play ten games a week and maybe do some dailies to afford enchants.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elektrik</div><div class="date">2009-01-22, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anybody that wants to raid needs about 9 other people, or 24 other people (yes i know...not necessarily...but don't be a penny-pincher please :) ), and that's (in my opinion) an aspect that needs not to be neglected.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well yeah, you're right - but luckily everybody is in a guild (or could be) that regularly does these raids. That is negligible. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The more people are involved, the more possible sources for errors are present. <br />
<br />
The more people that are involved, the less impact each person has on the outcome. Pretend you have someone who is terrible. He stands in the fire almost every fight, does 1500 dps in a 25 man, and is AFK because of his &quot;new baby&quot; for half the night. That, in NO way, prevents the raid from killing the boss.<br />
<br />
Now, pretend I'm doing 2s with this player. As the doors open, his baby starts crying and he goes to take care of it. <br />
<br />
Does that raid have a better chance to succeed? Or his lonely arena partner.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And as well as in arena, there is a difference between &quot;doing it&quot; and &quot;doing it well&quot;.<br />
So either you regard the &quot;doing well&quot; part for both, or none. You could as well say:<br />
Anybody that wants to arena, can do it and easily win some matches.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a big difference between in success between clearing a raid, and keeping your rating above 1500. There is a similarity between both of those though. Bad players will struggle to do both, but usually succeed.<br />
<br />
Now, lets compare clearing Naxx25 to getting to 2000 personal rating. Bad players pug Naxx25 from trade chat, and 5 hours later they walk out with their shiny new epics and delusional self confidence. Bad players have ZERO chance of coming close to 2000, let alone 2200, regardless if they are running DK/Holy pally. They will still get tromped by skilled people playing less optimal setups, and absolutely destroyed by all of the &quot;good&quot; DK/Holys at that rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy both sides of the game - but you have to provide some pretty good evidence to me to prove that moving out of a black circle on the ground and hiding behind a big wall of ice is more difficult than fighting intelligent people with minds of their own.</div></div><hr />

OMG its really these dumb people that pisses me off (not the people, but the way the game went)..<br />
<br />
do you even know warcraft?? as in WARcraft??<br />
<br />
tell me.. how many instances are there in warcraft when it got released (1996?) and when warcraft 2 came out? (1999, 2000?) or warcraft 3 (2003 somewhere?)<br />
<br />
hmm whats warcraft about?? ahhh yes, the struggle between mankind and orcs.. BOEM BOEM pvp kill kill attack!! then they got some elves and later the scourge...still war war war (as in.. warcraft)<br />
<br />
so wtf u talking about .. PVE was here first? oh and pvp was always possible in WoW, so better say this:<br />
<br />
the warcraft whole warcraft lore is about PVP and war, but a part of the game is PVE for the non-violent people... <br />
<br />
<br />
but i just heard the best comment ever (never would have expected that in a terrible thread like this)..<br />
<br />
PVP server, PVE server, where on PVE all is balanced around PVE , and in the PVP server, they balance stuff out for PVP!<br />

<br />
<br />
Then why do orcs fight undead and other orcs and all sorts of other races in arena? And why was there a single player component of the warcraft games? Pitiful argument.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">k0102</div><div class="date">2009-01-22, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">about the above:<br />
<br />
I never said arena was a good thing (eventhough its fun, it doesnt support whats warcraft is about.. though it could be considered &quot;training&quot; in the barracks ;))<br />
<br />
why was there a single player component in WC games? hmmm cuz even as a single player you can do pvp? *gasps*<br />
and in that singleplayer component.. how many murlocs did you kill? how many big bosses did you kill that dropped &quot;loot&quot;... plz think your statemens through before spitting on some1 thnx :)<br />
<br />
about the other poster :) (rofl im on a roll)<br />
you say that in pve you learn teamplay and socialize with the guild.. VERY TRUE!<br />
<br />
1 thing though.. i;ve been in a PVP guild, where we have the arena teams..<br />
but PVP is more than arena.. making premade battlegrounds, where you have to play your part as well, or even worse, a PUG battleground, where everyone has to be willing to LISTEN and coorperate or its a lose (though people tend to just mind their own business)<br />
<br />
then ofc there is world pvp, with 40 peepz in a raid, managing all and kill the gnome-king was our weekly raid :) so even pvp needs social skills<br />
<br />
imo its just the best if pvp doesnt flame pve, and pve doesnt flame pvp, cuz they are just two seperate worlds :)</div></div><hr />

Why did so few guilds clear BT and MH or Sunwell before they removed attunements and nerfed them?<br />
<br />
<br />
What? A TON of guilds cleared BT and Hyjal before they nerfed them. Lets assume that on average, 5 guilds per server cleared them when they were still &quot;hard.&quot; We'll assume that each of these guilds have about 30 regular raiders. Keep in mind that both of these numbers are probably low-balled by a fair amount. Regardless, that gives us 150 players, PER SERVER that succeeded in the ultimate goal.<br />
<br />
Now, according to http://www.arenajunkies.com/calculator/ , it looks like about (on average) 225 people PER BATTLEGROUP get Glad. <br />
<br />
Now, time for some math.<br />
<br />
There are like 18 servers per battlegroup, meaning (18 * 150) = 2,700 people per battlegroup &quot;win&quot; PvE. Still, 225 people &quot;win&quot; PvP.<br />
<br />
There are 13 battlegroups in the US. 35,100 people win PvE in the US, and 2,925 people win PvP in the US. PvP is harder.<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this is a ridiculous assumption, and these numbers are way off, but you get the general idea.</div></div><hr />

Of course you can't tool your group in advance, but neither can your opponent. He has to deal with the situation in a short time, just like you have - so I wouldn't take this as an argument that arena is harder than pve.<br />
And please do not get me wrong, I do fully agree that it's more challenging to play against real enemies than to fight computer-controlled foes. But - in a class-based game like wow, I think it's impossible to find a really convenient balance, since the scissor-paper-rock principle applies. In my opinion, it's also not the right way to try to do so, because &quot;corrections&quot; done because of an imbalance in pvp affect pve, and that is some kind of limitation for pve. Like I said earlier in this thread, if you want things to be (at least almost) balanced, play some game that gives each player the same chances. I think this should not be the goal of an mmorpg. Of course, this is a somehow &quot;romantic&quot; point of view, since many people want pvp in the game, and many people = a lot of money...so it's there. Why tell the people to play another game/genre when we can earn money with them?<br />
<br />
Concerning the &quot;raid always drops loot&quot; point: Raid would not drop loot if you are too terribad to kill anything ;) You could get lots of the arena gear in tbc with losing 10 games a week and stacking arena points. You could get the nonset pvp items for idling in bgs...tbqh I don't exactly know how things are handled in LK as I don't pvp anymore.<br />
You can, as well as you can in pve, kick bad teammates and group with better ones.<br />
<br />
And as a last comment, you say you owned lots of pve people in raid dps...well, you preach to the choir to me when you say raid content is made too easy. Terribad players overall, doing crappy dps for example...but they seem to be in the majority. And if the majority cries for nerfs, they will come - as a loss of these players would mean a loss of money. I would be delighted if there would be more challenging raid content. And I don't mean the usual &quot;challenge&quot; of gearing up...<br />
<br />
(Please be patient if I can't express myself clearly...I'm not a native speaker :( )<br />

Edit: @ Elektrik<br />
&quot;Now, according to http://www.arenajunkies.com/calculator/ , it looks like about (on average) 225 people PER BATTLEGROUP get Glad.&quot; - Well, since (as far as I know) the amount of gladiators is percentage-based...this is no argument.</div></div><hr />

Know what the fighting isnt about? A spectator sport run by goblins. Instead it has always been big epic struggles between horde and alliance. Arenas? A childs pasttime and not real fighting. Battlegrounds and world pvp is what the real fighting should always been about. That is where 90% of the focus and gear should revolve around.<br />
<br />
And as far as the ULTRA RETARDED pve v pvp server thing goes, I have played both and I see way more pvp on pve servers go figure. On pvp servers sure everyone is flagged but everyone isnt always attacking everyone else and there is little to no ganking at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Elektrik of course only a certain number get Gladiator, thats the way Blizzard set it. You can't compare the open system of PvE progression to PvP's ladder structure. If Blizzard had said &quot;only the top percentage of guilds will be allowed to clear BT and MH then we will close them down&quot; there might be some comparison.</div></div><hr />

If you see it from that point of view - ok. But at least in Germany, the &quot;level&quot; of the battlegroups differs significantly. A friend of mine switched servers to another battlegroup, and he didn't really improve over night nor did his partner. But he was never above 1700 on our group, and reached &gt;2k after a few days on the new one. So, I guess some better players don't reach gladiator title, just because the challenge is higher in their group.<br />
<br />
But anyhow, my original concern was NOT to have a debate about who has the bigger e-peen, pvp or pve players. Since, in the end it's just a game, and most of us won't earn a cent with playing it - so playing it just for fun. Maybe I'm just a little tired at the moment, because I think things are becoming more and more...unified (don't know if this is the correct word :| ). And my guess is, that this is because the developers are forced to have an eye on the balance for pvp.<br />
I am in fact a fan of pvp - but I prefer equal chances for each one. (Like in q3a for example. If I want &quot;pvp&quot;, I play that.)<br />
<br />
And of course I know that it's useless to qq here ;) but I'm at work and I'm quite bored today...so, I am also mostly arguing for the same reason you do ;)<br />

I bet those same 5 people were there when you killed Illidan too... And how about on Twins when someone didnt run out of the group with conflagrate? Or someone attacked the sheeped targets on Muru?There are slowpokes in a good number of raids for sure.<br />
However in arenas you have slowpokes too, those who can't get higher than 1500 and were forming the bottom of the pyramid. You might not notice them from the high ratings but without them you'd all be lower too, since someone has to lose matches. There'd be more competition, more lost matches and everyone would lose several hundred points of rating.<br />
<br />
As you can see, there are scrubs everywhere and they also largely impact the score you can get arena.<br />
(that and the fact that some encounters won't ever be feasible with scrubs)<br />
<br />
<br />
The more people that are involved, the less impact each person has on the outcome.Wrong, the Archimonde fight is a good example of that.<br />
For those who want to compare raids to higher rated arena matches, don't look at Naxxramas as the difficulty of Naxx25 is exactly the same as Nax10 (minus getting 25 players instead of only 10). Try to use some of the more challenging fights if you want to make your analogy usefull.</div></div><hr />

Typical Arena tard attitude. There is more to PvP than Arena. The fact is those who enjoy battlegrounds or even world PvP (what little WoW has) are forced to do Arena for PvP gear. Well, apart from WG boss but you can only do WG boss once a week.</div></div><hr />

Try the world / server first titles for clears. That's about the equiv for the gladiator title. That's one group per server, or per world for those. I think that's on most servers a far side smaller percentages then the gladiator titles. Only difference is, we don't get any extra gear because we're already dominating to make it easier to keep dominating a season.<br />
<br />
Either way, title or no, both sides can keep playing, both sides get gear for time put in. It's pretty much moot. There are some PvEers that are absolutely horrible at arenas, and PvPers that are absolutely horrible at PvE and fail the &quot;don't stand in the fire&quot; test. Both sides can continue to get gear no matter how bad they are at it. (Though skill becomes a limiter on both sides for getting the &quot;best&quot; gear)<br />
<br />
I can't really complain much because my pvp time has mostly moved on to fleet battles in EvE. <br />
<br />
Now if we had some sort of territory control system for pvp in wow more then a scheduled battle over a single keep... but I'm off topic and pipedreaming for that one...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiredhealer</div><div class="date">2009-01-22, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizz creates the constant arguement between pve and pvp players. It is well in their power to seperate pve from pvp, there are already different rules for how some spells work in pve and pvp.<br />
<br />
As Blizz saw the demand for pvp grow with the battles in Old Hillsbrad they attempted to add it into the game because a lot of customers liked it. This was a good move, but when it translated into arenas the two should have been seperated.<br />
<br />
The resilience stat necessary for pvp and not pve created even more problems between pve and pvp, different gear to be sucessful. Some classes depend on crit others don't, so resilience works differently class to class. To attempt to balance this changes to class damage methods were needed and this caused problems in pve. It seems Blizz has lost touch with the most important thing in life, &quot;keep it simple stupid&quot;. <br />
<br />
This should be good for customers except the methods for getting the gear began to forece customers do content that they really didn't want to do in the first place. You now have to several different battlegrounds along with arena to farm the gear. Gear began to have rating on it that were more difficult for some classes than others. Human nature comes in to play here. When people think they are being discriminated against because of their class they become offended and angry. This is a bad thing for a companys customers. <br />
<br />
WotLK has changed some of it but it seems there is still to much busy work in the game to arrive at your ultimate goal. Some people just like arenas, some just like certain battleground, some pve, and a few all of the above. Forcing people to do content they really don't want to do, in order to feel like they have an even chance in another part is bad. This offends and makes them angry at the same time. You should be able to take different paths to the same gear for pvp. You should be able to get a full equal set either by battlegrounds, world pvp, or arenas. Give them different names to show where they came from but not different stats.<br />
<br />
Maybe the best thing might be everytime a Blizz employee makes a statement the word customer should be used instead of player. It seems that Blizz employees have become increasing more overbearing and defensive with their customers lately. It's been my experience, with my employees, that usually the most defensive are doing the worse job. Those who can't listen to criticism and either agree with it or give reasons why it's not valid are the ones who won't make it long term. The world is in a recession, customers are the dearest things a company can have. Currently it seems Blizz doesn't see this.</div></div><hr />

No, that isn't the same thing at all. If there was a &quot;World first 2200 2's team,&quot; then THAT would be equivalent. When you're looking at a world first ANYTHING, it is difficult.

Bullshit. Someone clearly wasn't in Sunwell at all pre-patch. Anyone who tells you that the end of Sunwell was easy is lying and/or was never there. And bringing more people? On anything past Brut (and because of fires, even ON brut), adding 5 more people to the 25 man raid would have increased the chance that someone fucked up, and wiped you. Oh yeah, and has been mentioned before: Gorefiend. I know of many guilds that couldn't get him on reliable farm until they out-geared it by quite a bit, due to the fact that there was always a certain percentage of players who couldn't do the ghost. Bring more people, get a higher likelihood of getting a ghost retard.<br />
<br />
Anyways, right now is the first time that there has been a clear answer to the PvE or PvP difficulty question, and as soon as ulduar comes out, that changes again. So why don't people just fucking accept that their love child isn't any necessarily any harder than the people they're arguing with, becuase it makes EVERYONE look like fucking retards.</div></div><hr />

This is a rather dumb comment tbh. Imhoo WG, Arena and BG should all require PVP gear to own. Playing PVP in PVE gear should suck really hard! (it currently does not!) <br />
Sure PVE gear does alot DMG, but that should not mean anything when u face someone with 900 resi. <br />
<br />
And PVP gear in PVE environment should suck hard as well (and it does!). You PVE tards (and im one of em) got shit luck! You dont even need to PVP to get free ez mode PVP epics like WG, heroic badges etc, while PVP players who dont got time to raid 6 hours straight have to raid to get some descent weapons at lower ratings.<br />
<br />
Stop rolling on my PVP items in WG you PVE tard!! Even with EZ mode deadlys you would still suck! :p<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Ive been playing PVP since release of WOTLK and all my gear is farmed by doing Arena and BGs. Ive never had the chance to get a WG deadly because some PVE tard wins a roll on PVP item and thinks to himself: Oeh this nice shiny pvp piece will come in handy when i do a BG once a week. They should really split up PVE and PVP cause its stupid tards like this that wanne make me gank some pve alliance in WG and BG over and over and over..</div></div><hr />

Well last time I checked, you can get pvp gear from honor points alone right? So you're not forced to arena for pvp gear (except weapons but i believe they're changing that). Sure you can't get deadly gear from it but if you want the best gear you have to excel in all areas of pvp.

You dont even need to PVP to get free ez mode PVP epics like WG, heroic badges etc, while PVP players who dont got time to raid 6 hours straight have to raid to get some descent weapons at lower ratings.<br />
<br />
Stop rolling on my PVP items in WG you PVE tard!! Even with EZ mode deadlys you would still suck! :p<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Ive been playing PVP since release of WOTLK and all my gear is farmed by doing Arena and BGs. Ive never had the chance to get a WG deadly because some PVE tard wins a roll on PVP item and thinks to himself: Oeh this nice shiny pvp piece will come in handy when i do a BG once a week. They should really split up PVE and PVP cause its stupid tards like this that wanne make me gank some pve alliance in WG and BG over and over and over..<br />

<br />
Buff PVE gear, Spec, DPS as much as ppl desire. So everyone can do 8/10k crits on bosses (and to other pve geared players). This will keep PVE players balanced in Arena since its more about lucky crits that decide the match.<br />
<br />
But!<br />
<br />
Make PVP resilience count so hard that a 10k crit will be a 2k crit on the PVP player. Then make a PVP players gear do around 4k crits and voila, the pvp player should win the arena. While his DPS is way to low to kill any raid boss.<br />
<br />
It was a huge mistake to make all specs valid for PVP.</div></div><hr />

Someone clearly wasn't in Sunwell at all pre-patch. Anyone who tells you that the end of Sunwell was easy is lying and/or was never there. And bringing more people? On anything past Brut (and because of fires, even ON brut), adding 5 more people to the 25 man raid would have increased the chance that someone fucked up, and wiped you. Oh yeah, and has been mentioned before: Gorefiend. I know of many guilds that couldn't get him on reliable farm until they out-geared it by quite a bit, due to the fact that there was always a certain percentage of players who couldn't do the ghost. Bring more people, get a higher likelihood of getting a ghost retard.<br />
<br />
Anyways, right now is the first time that there has been a clear answer to the PvE or PvP difficulty question, and as soon as ulduar comes out, that changes again. So why don't people just fucking accept that their love child isn't any necessarily any harder than the people they're arguing with, becuase it makes EVERYONE look like fucking retards. <br />

Second, didn't they specifically say that they were making it so that pvp gear wasn't the best for feral tanks in wotlk? Because i got my deadly legs from vault, and they are better than t7.5.<br />

Third, while Ghostcrawler may be partially responsible for this retarded patch, he isn't solely responsible, and I personally don't blame him at all. What I do hate him for is that week after week he posts in his fancy blue text paragraphs and paragraphs of bullshit that ends up actually meaning little or nothing or restating the same thing over and over. He can go ahead and keep doing that if he wants, but I'd appreciate it if he didn't classify them as actual answers to legitimate questions and expect us to swallow his BS and thank him for &quot;communicating&quot; with us.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zavi</div><div class="date">2009-01-22, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it's entirely fair to compare woltk raiding with any kind of pvp (especially not woltk pvp). None of the aspects are actually developed throughoutly.<br />
<br />
But to put a comparisation for the end of BC (before 3.0 and mob nerfs), I consider that being a well balanced over the course of a few years.<br />
<br />
The furthest I ever got in the two major aspects of the game at the time (raiding and arena) was 2150 rating (s3) and clearing sunwell. My personal opinion regarding this, is that sunwell was harder and more frustrating than any pvp match at the peak of my rating (which I know aint by far high).<br />
<br />
I just think it's a good idea to compare raids to an arena rating, and so far, just like the release of BC, we're not past the 1400 rating bracket yet in pve. SSC or TK started out as lower end 1600 brackets (IMO) and ended with their respective bosses around 1900 in &quot;toughness&quot; (taking retard fellow players into the equation).<br />
MH and BT again starting at a pathetic 1700 bracket, and ending again just slightly over 1950.<br />
Sunwell going from 2k to whatever, never been above 2150, as said. Could imagine something like 2.5k rating.<br />
<br />
+/-</div></div><hr />

So you're not forced to arena for pvp gear (except weapons but i believe they're changing that). Sure you can't get deadly gear from it but if you want the best gear you have to excel in all areas of pvp. BTW I BG alot more than I arena, probably alot more than you also, and I say keep arenas! <br />
<br />
<br />
You can get shit gear from honour, in fact its so bad you are better using PvE gear. But thats still not the point, Arena has been placed at the top of the PvP tree, where it shouldn't be because its so limited and so prone to class balance issues. Treat it equally like any other bg.</div></div><hr />

Seams the same for you! please check all of the content in vanilla wow and TBC and just check that there is actully a bunch of fights that is considerd hard or almost impossible check before they got nerfed ect not the easy mode versions that yo uprolly went to!<br />

That's a great idea, except it ruins Blizzard idea that WoW is an E-sport, and since nobody wants to spectate 40 vs 40, we have Arena.</div></div><hr />

Arenas in-game are the gladiatorial combats that both Alliance and Horde have always run as part of the back-story of the Warcraft universe. Gladiator combat is a central part of the Horde cultural make-up, which is why Orgrimmar had an arena inside of it before there was ever any Arena. It's also part of the Alliance - Thrall's entire backstory is founded on his adoption by Blackmoore for the purpose of training him for the gladiatorial pits.<br />
<br />
Lore-wise, arena combat is considerably more well-founded and makes more sense than battlegrounds (the supposed constant skirmishes that somehow never actually lead to war between two factions with a very brittle truce.)<br />

I think you're mistaking arenas (2v2, 3v3, 5v5) for duels (1v1) The difference is that in a duel you do not actually kill the person, which means you are fighting each other, training your skills, determining who is a better warrior, but never with the intent of killing your opponent. In arenas that is totally different, and made even more illogical by fighting teams of either horde or alliance to the death. I think you also forget that declaring war is a big step, one that leaders are hesitant to take. I would hardly call 40 (or less) players from each side fighting over an area that does not seem to be too significant to bring the two factions to war. If it was important enough to go to war over, I think thrall would show up there. And to reply to your childish end to a surprisingly articulate post: I do not and have not ever played an RP server, however I do enjoy when the game follows the lore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Typical Arena tard attitude. There is more to PvP than Arena. The fact is those who enjoy battlegrounds or even world PvP (what little WoW has) are forced to do Arena for PvP gear. Well, apart from WG boss but you can only do WG boss once a week.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a rather dumb comment tbh. Imhoo WG, Arena and BG should all require PVP gear to own. Playing PVP in PVE gear should suck really hard! (it currently does not!) <br />

You completely and utterly misunderstood my post. Congratulations on adding to the growing pool of evidence that PvP players are monkeys.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your point was that if you would want to get good PVP gear, u need to do arena. And you would rather farm BG for that gear (cause you dont wanne put much effort into it).<br />
<br />
My point was, no you dont! U can do heroics and raids and get a rather descent set of gear for PVP wich is comparable with T7. Do you honestly hope to believe that you can get T8 quality PVP items by farming BG's in the weekends while you watch a movie and jump up and down?<br />
<br />
On the other hand! While you can do heroics to get pvp gear from badges, and get pve gear from raid bosses a PVP player has to do raid bosses to get weapons and trinkets wich cant be obtained by farming honor, and require a rather high rating.<br />
<br />
If my point wasnt the exact oposite of you point, then you should learn to clarify youself better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The number of participants is a gameplay mechanic. The Alliance arenas Thrall fought in were to the death. The Horde arenas Varian Wrynn fought in were to the death.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would hardly call 40 (or less) players from each side fighting over an area that does not seem to be too significant to bring the two factions to war.<br />
<br />
Again, the number of participants is a gameplay mechanic. If you're going to talk lore, remember to include the tons of npcs wandering around the zone.<br />
Alterac Valley is the homeland of the Frostwolf clan - Thrall's clan. It's not a significant area resource-wise (such as Warsong Gulch) but it certainly has a lot of personal significance for the most central Horde character - who also happens to be the warchief.<br />
<br />
Every time the Alliance play that battleground, they are leading an invasion of dwarves into Thrall's homeland, killing his tribal family, and then finish it off by murdering his mentor.</div></div><hr />

I always knews Blizzard was somehow linked with goldsellers, they say its bad forbidden blablabla as a cover. If Blizzard was officially selling gold it would be seen bad by players and some would quit, but as it's not official, it's somehow &quot;ok&quot;...<br />
How do you explain that there is still advertisements nowadays on trade channel, when me, try to create a trial account to make my tiny ridiculous advertisement on opposite faction trade channel like &quot;WTB 5 of lunacy on neutral AH&quot; or stuff, I can't even do it!<br />
<br />
Trust me it wasn't an issue, it was an issue you mean in the way &quot;oops we clicked on the wrong button&quot;, but how did the ad get here ? it proove they have this ad on their system or whatever...<br />
<br />
Blizzard is part of the gold selling stuff, and the company they charged a couple year ago was probably not their own, so didn't like competition on the gold selling...<br />
<br />
This screenshot by itself proove it, get over it...<br />
<br />
If Blizzard really mean that the goldselling is forbidden, take your guts right now, and kick EVERYBODY that is buying, selling, advertising, licking, and even speaking of gold selling.<br />
But they don't have guts...and people will cry because they can't buy their gold...<br />
Now I just hope this screenshot stay on your mind, it is in no way anodin, did you ever see an add from another society of wow forums ? I never did...all ads you see on wow forums are OWNED by Blizzard (and related), end of story.<br />
<br />
And if they kicked from the game the first guy that bought golds in wow, there would be NO MORE... It's like a disease, you MMO champion, repeat mindlessly it's forbidden, but it's forbidden, but you don't get banned when you buy gold, define &quot;Forbidden?&quot;... Forbidden in Blizzard language means &quot;you can buy gold and you won't get kicked&quot;...<br />
<br />
If people kicked for buying gold, they would not even need to kick people because everybody would know you get kick when you buy gold, exaclty as there is a global knowledge that you don't get kicked when you buy gold...it's like an urban legend, it don't take long to spread...So why didn't they kick a few people to make example ? There would be no buyers, no sellers, nothing. They don't because they are part of it, or they sit it in another way &quot;if people buy gold, maybe they are going to buy items, play more, be happy, uh well the guy paid 30euros to buy his thing, he wont quit because it's an investissement&quot;. etc...<br />
If you buy the bullshit of blizzard of the link you gave (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/antigold.html), then you are a moron bouboul. This link is just to illustrate the first point I gave in my message. It's directed to the people that DONT buy gold to reassure them &quot;you see guys we don't like gold sellers more than you do&quot;...</div></div><hr />
