Just in time for International Talk Like a Pirate Day, we’re celebrating all things pirate with a special limited-time offer*. Purchase 180 Days Game Time in the Shop, and you’ll also receive the epic new Dreadwake mount free! The Dreadwake mount will then arrive as a stand-alone mount in the Blizzard Shop and in-game shop sometime in 2019.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3 mounts.<br />
2 pets<br />
2 toys<br />
A &quot;see you later&quot; bundle to try and tempt people into buying something they will probably bring back later.<br />
Oh and a discount on services right before they finally released some heavily anticipated Allied Races....<br />
<br />
Yeah they totally haven't been going hard on MTX than any other expansion with WoW guys. :rolleyes:<br />

Nah it'll be the &quot;see you later&quot; bundle next. Which didn't actually need removing but they just did.<br />
<br />
Say what you want but it's an undeniable fact they've been pushing Microtransactions faster and harder than ever in WoW. So the sub count must be at an all time low.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They literally said it would be going on the cash shop later but you get it for free (or was it 10$?) now if you sub for x months.<br />
<br />
Anyone who got “baited” probably jumped right into it not reading anything at all assuming that it was only available for the promo. The promotion was that you got a mount for subbing for 6 months.<br />
<br />
Was very excited to see how many people claim blizzard baited them. Sheer ignorance.<br />
<br />
Anyone who says blizzard baited them, go back and read this: https://www.wowhead.com/news=287276/blizzard-shop-180-days-of-game-time-dreadwake-mount-capn-crackers-battle-pet</div></div><hr />

It doesn't float in the ground so yes. You can already water walk it with path of frost or water walking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah they'll give it the ability to water walk without it and let you have a free equipment slot knowing them. Just so they can see if they can push the bar out a little more with the MTX.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't matter though. When there's so much critiscism on classes, why would you release a mount?! We (I say this as ME because &quot;WhO iS wE&quot;) want class fixes, changes, info on what's happening. Not another fucking cosmetic. If I wanted to play a F2P game I would.</div></div><hr />

I don't play betas, don't inform myself that much on wow expansions, so i never knew that coming. Of that 6 months i probably used 1/20. But for this part i have only myself to blame.</div></div><hr />

Sure it does.<br />
Again, the team working on classes has nothing to do whatsoever with their marketing and art team.<br />
<br />

Happy to see they posted on Enh Shamans: Oh wait, Mount.<br />
Happy to see the posted about Paladins mobility: Oh wait, Mount.<br />
Happy to see they posted about M+, Oh wai! M O U N T.<br />
Happy to see how the posted on Proffs and how irrelevant they are, O H W A I T! M O U N T.<br />
Happy to see the posted on most Tanks being complete rubbish, O _ H W_A_I_T!.! M O U N T.<br />

This is not the time to release news about a mount, this is the time to reassure your player base that changes are coming to terrible classes.<br />

It was never a promo-only mount. They said it would go to shop later.<br />
<br />
Who wants to bet the &quot;see you later&quot; bundles back in a month or two?[/QUOTE]<br />
They also stated those would return eventually.<br />
<br />
That's not to say it isn't a shady tactic, but it's not like it was a secret or anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
So we (well, me at least) got baited to subscribe for 6 month to get this mount and just a few days after those 6 months have passed by they put it on the shop? Blizzard's lowest low for me personally.<br />
It's not baiting if they tell you what will happen.</div></div><hr />

A storemount isn't changes. How can anyone not understand that the two are not related. No one was fucking pulled off the class design team to write this blog post or even 9 months ago to model the mount in the first place. You are whining about dumb shit that has nothing to do with what you are saying. You are going up to the girl scouts outside of a grocery store and bitchmoaning about how the grocery store's tiles need to be replaced because they are cracking, and how dare the grocery store have girl scouts selling cookies when they should be fixing the floor.<br />

Wrong. It was advertised as going into the store later on.<br />

Only those with half a brain thought it was a &quot;get it before it's gone!&quot; promo instead of a &quot;get it early&quot; promo.<br />

Also yes, the &quot;see you later&quot; bundles said they'd be back eventually too. That's why it's called &quot;see you later&quot; instead of &quot;get me or never see me again&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I already know you don’t know who works where or who got fired so I’ll just ignore that. Which class had let’s buttons then a dota 2 character? Genuinely curious as none of the ones I have played do but I’ve limited my self to only two classes this expan.</div></div><hr />

Dota heroes have 4-5 spells each. Then 6 item slots which are normally hotkey'd for quick access. So 11 buttons just for the spells/items alone. <br />

No point in doing AoE they removed shuriken combo. Better to take out priority targets with high ST <br />
<br />
And I already said you pop cooldowns which is a once every few mins kind of deal. No hate against cooldowns but when the rotation is 3 spells and spells like gouge/blind are removed or useless then I have a big problem</div></div><hr />

so just logging onto my old rogue to actually check, unless you think things like blind, feint, kick ect ect are not worth using sub is beating out dota by like 10+ keybinds. unless your trying to argue that rouges should just sit on every mod like its patchwork and only go though there rotation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I disagree, actually.<br />
<br />
There's a huge difference (IMO) to the time period after.<br />
<br />
It's actually a marketing tactic. They put out a promotion with a mount that will make people want to spend money on said promotion. It gives the buyer the feeling of exclusivity, even if they said it would be released in 2019 - one would assume later rather than sooner. Blizzard wouldn't create the sense of urgency by adding it to a promotion. They relied on people assuming it would be later because if people knew it would be a couple of months they wouldn't spend money on the promotion.<br />
<br />
Now I didn't buy the mount so I don't have a stake in the race, but it is most certainly a jerk tactic to use against the customer.<br />
<br />
They could have released it in later 2019.</div></div><hr />

Shouldn't have been a bundle in the first place. It's them cash grabbing by saying &quot;get it now before it goes&quot; despite the fact they were taking up no space being on the store. Doesn't matter if they were being bought or not it's a digital fucking item. Leave it alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it also sounds like handing out a free mount and cheaper sub for 6 months is REALLY pushing the mtx super hard. especially considering they said the mount would be available in the shop at a later date. if you were losing interest in the game, its your own fault for subbing for 6 months if you had planned to unsub, knowing you could purchase this mount as a standalone in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You still got it for free, while now it costs 25 bucks. If you didn't want to subscribe for 6 months, you shouldn't have done that. But otherwise it still saved you 25 dollars just there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I disagree with a lot of Blizzard's decisions of late, but anyone angered by this can only be angry at themselves for their lack of reading comprehension.<br />
<br />
I don't even understand how anyone could get angry for that. If you wanted to play anyway, you still got a mount for free and potentially saved 25 bucks. If you didn't want to play and only subscribed for that ... man that was one expensive mount, and you only have yourself to blame (plus reading troubles).<br />
<br />
Either way, anyone getting upset about this is really just extremely misguided.</div></div><hr />

You know Blizzard used to not be like this though right? Once upon a time it wasn’t all just about making money. That’s why people get upset. Blizzard didn’t put shit like this out until years post WoW launching. And back then the player community rejected it instantly which is why That Retarded Horse became a thing. <br />
<br />
For me I don’t give a fuck anymore. I’ve long since moved on from giving a shit what Blizzard does. They are no longer the same company they once were. That’s life. They can put out a new store mount every month if they want and I’ll just shrug and chuckle. If people want to buy it, they can go for it.</div></div><hr />

It's a shit move and you know it. Releasing it just a few days after the 6 month sub was up? That's Activision move, not Blizzard. It's a cash grab. It shows how far Blizzard has fallen. They are no longer the quality company they once were</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eapoe</div><div class="date">2019-04-24, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard put this out as a bonus to people who use the 6 month sub feature. They announced it would be up later on the cash shop. Basically, people who already had 6 months got early access to it as a bonus, but people rushed out to get a 6 month sub to get the item for free (added on to a fee they already paid), and it’s now released as an in game purchase. <br />
There’s nothing low about this other than people’s attitude about the game company. Nothing underhanded or sneaky or despicable happened. Just people jumping to conclusions to hate on Blizzard because it’s the thing to do now. Don’t believe me? Look at almost every hate thread and laugh at what people are actually complaining about the most.<br />

<br />
<br />
How is it a cash grab? This is like saying it’s a cash grab to out it on the shop at all. People who had a 6 month sub got it for free and early access. Jesus you people really stretch things out to act like some great wrong has been brought down on you.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. Normally I'd just laugh, but its annoying when the lowest common denominators always seem to be the first ones to rush to the comment section and post. Unemployed and nothing else to do I'm guessing?<br />
<br />
That said, even though Blizz did nothing wrong on this, you'd think somebody in their company would be smart enough to realize the 'optics' might not be ideal releasing it again that soon after the 6 months expired.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what is wrong with that? You got it for free for buying 6-months or you could wait to buy it for the likely $25 sometime in 2019. Nothing is a bad move. Nothing is Activision. My 6 months was up at the beginning of March. Some people's six months might not have ended yet. It all depends when they bought the 6-month subscription.<br />

Btw did you know it was Blizzard that helped convince Activision to merge? So perhaps at least but the irrational hate where it is due. On Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

CDPR seem to be doing a good job. Yeah they sell DLC but it's either dirt cheap or of top notch quality that feels like a new game.<br />
<br />
Lot of Indie devs/companies are able to make amazing games on a budget smaller than AAA devs.<br />
<br />
Nintendo after the Wii U failure. Satoru Iwata the CEO of Nintendo took a paycut to avoid people being fired saying the Wii U was his burden to bear and firing people wouldn't help morale.<br />
<br />
Capcom did a complete turnaround on design after Street Fighter 5 came under heavy criticism and now they've been throwing out amazing products as of late.<br />
<br />
It's not about not affording. It's that ActiBlizz are just flat out greedy and fire 800 employees after bragging about a record year because Kotick wouldn't dare take a paycut to stop that. There are plenty of good companies out there who know how to balance profit with making a quality experience. Blizzard is just not one of them anymore.</div></div><hr />

If you ran your own business, whos main objective is to earn money, would you have 800 people you didn't need, employed, leeching salaries ? They were reduntant, and thats why they got cut. Im not defending this action, mainly cause i don't really care. People losing their jobs, it sucks, but it happens on a daily basis world wide. business is business<br />
<br />
and yeah. small indie companies can easily make great games on a low budget, Because they don't have the same expectations as someone like blizzard, cdpr, square enix. They make small games that focus on a specific theme. But the keyword here is small.<br />
<br />
and don't forget that cdpr outright lied about witcher 3 modding. They said we would get the redkit where we could design our own adventures, and then nothing.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who paid for 6 months game time just for a mount that everyone knew was going to release as a store mount afterward deserves to get pissed on. It was a small, free perk to people who were going to be subbed for 6 months anyway, and anyone bitter that picked up their sub just for the mount has only themselves to blame.<br />

<br />
Honestly, I can't understand this gripe. <br />
<br />
If you signed up for the 6 months, you got the mount for free. In fact it was even more a bonus for me because prior to that promotion I didn't realise that you could buy a six month bundle with Blizzard balance, which means that I ended up spending 5 tokens for 6 months game time plus the mount. <br />
<br />
The fact that they have put it on the shop means that people who missed out can still get it, it just costs them a bit more. This is really the best outcome for all IMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
If your complaint is that the only reason you signed up for 6 months was to get the mount, and if it weren't for the mount then you would've unsubscribed, then sorry, but you're not going to find any sympathy from me. Why would any rational person who doesn't care enough about the game to actually want to be subbed for those 6 months really care enough about a silly mount? You can't blame Blizzard for your inability to say &quot;no&quot; to things like this.</div></div><hr />

Dude, why don't you just stop posting on the WoW forums? We get it already. You are bitter at the game, bitter at Blizzard, and your only purpose here seems now to complain about everything and try and convert people to FFXIV.<br />
<br />
As others have pointed out, they never said it was a &quot;promo only mount&quot;, they actually explicitly said it would come to the shop. The point of the promo was to get it for &quot;free&quot;. <br />
<br />
And I have to say, the irony of you calling Blizzard's tactics at getting people to play their game &quot;disgusting&quot; given the tactics you've been employing to try to get people to play FFXIV is not lost on me.</div></div><hr />

i also bought it but because i would have payed monthly anyway so i got the mount free and also a little discount</div></div><hr />

<br />
3 mounts.<br />
2 pets<br />
2 toys<br />
A &quot;see you later&quot; bundle to try and tempt people into buying something they will probably bring back later.<br />
Oh and a discount on services right before they finally released some heavily anticipated Allied Races....<br />
<br />
Yeah they totally haven't been going hard on MTX than any other expansion with WoW guys. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
So....one extra mount to you is &quot;going hard&quot;? Legion had two store mounts added.<br />
<br />
I mean, you miss that one of the pets was a fundraiser pet (Whomper).<br />
<br />
Sales on services really isn't that odd.</div></div><hr />

Activision tell them to focus on profit making, BFA includes a hella lot more focus on MTX/service sales at the cost of a quality game.<br />
<br />
Isn't hard to see the correlation but w/e I guess. Let's just pretend they haven't been more focused on MTX since Daddy Activision stuck their nose in and told them to focus on it. <br />

People conveniently forget facts that do not fit their idiotic narative. Just like when they conveniently forgot that when it was a free-gift-with-purchase that it was a promotion already data-mined months prior, and released on International Talk Like a Pirate Day. But no... it was a desperate attempt to boost money because BfA was such a &quot;failure&quot;.</div></div><hr />

There isn't a large focus on micro transactions. They are just doing what they have always done since they introduced the shop. Besides if you clearly ignoring WoD where they add Tokens. That will always be the leader in focus on micro transactions and out paces anything you can claim was earned with BfA added store items. Of course it isn't hard to see hate and conspiracy theories.

Because you're overreacting.<br />
<br />
It's one extra mount, and you're acting like it's been every single mount.<br />
And the toys are new because it's part of a new esports competition they have, which took off in popularity with Legion.<br />

Well yea ok, thats one way to look at it. <br />
<br />
I dont really care either way, but I like when they add stuff in the game that I can work for without bothering about having to buy tokens.<br />

Your first post in this thread was literally an over reaction based on false information as a cherry on top.<br />
<br />
<br />
So much for it being a promo only mount. Who wants to bet the &quot;see you later&quot; bundles back in a month or two? Absolutely disgusting hook tactics.<br />
<br />
Of course they could have funded something with out toys. The toys however give a way for fans to add more to the prize pool that otherwise would not be there. They did the same with Starcraft 2 and it has been a big hit. There is no reason why Blizzard is bad for expanding it to other products.</div></div><hr />

Yes, please Blizzard, fund your tournaments as a money pit that just causes them to lose money. I know you're a company that exists to make money, but my entertainment is more important so do it at a loss just like you already do for BlizzCon. <br />
<br />
It's not &quot;Telling you how you feel&quot;. It's a fact. The only difference is one mount and two toys, which the two toys have a legit explanation as to why that's more than the last expansion, and you're acting like it's the end of the world.<br />

Exclusive because it was given during a specific time window for a specific sub plan.<br />
I am subbed in WoW for years and the cheapest long term subscription is on 6 month recurring, so the only thing that changed for me was getting a mount without paying anything I don't already pay to access the game anyway. So I am not sure what's your point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I regret not doing this personally. I can't justify 25 bucks for a store mount on its own, but I was too blinded by salt and stupidity to simply upgrade my sub to a 6 month from 3 to pick it up. (I was really disappointed that this wasn't a proper water mount that sat in the water like a proper ship and moved faster in water).<br />
<br />
With my luck they'll modify the mount to do just that and I'll get to feel more salty for not picking it up during the promo. Lesson learned.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Not to mention I main a mage. Correct mage class mount is a promo mount. /sadness</div></div><hr />

Nope, they got their 6-months-worth money in advance, and that's all they wanted. And yet, if anybody said 'it's a bait', white-knights have been raising an alarm, and shouted that it's a bullshit. And honestly, I am sorry for you, and your money. I would never like to be cheated by Blizzard, but this is how it works now :(<br />
<br />
But it literally isn't bait. It isn't some grand conspiracy. It was a reward and incentive to subscribe for 6-months. They out right told everyone that you can wait to purchase it separately at some point in 2019. You could play for 6 months and get it at no extra cost. Or you could wait and pay the assumed (at the time) $25 for it. Blizzard didn't cheat anyone. What is BS is all of those people that hate so much that they try to twist everything into something and think less of people who are not equally blinded by hate.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that from day one they said up front that it will be back in shop later on if someone doesn't want to get it with the 6month sub? If you wanna be outraged, at least check your info, otherwise you just look like an idiot. Though looking at other posts here...I suppose I should say you look like an average MMO-C poster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So 1.) They said from the beginning that this mount would be on the store later. So if you're offended and/or surprised it's on the store well guess what? You're a moron.<br />
<br />
2.) If you thought BfA was a steaming pile and you signed up for a 6 month sub FOR A MOUNT - You are moron. Also a bigger than average moron because you gave Blizzard 90 dollars instead of 25. So double moron on this one<br />
<br />
3.) If you were going to stay subbed for 6 months anyway well, congratualtions, to you the mount was free. And again if you thought the only way you could get it was from a 6 month sub then you lack basic reading comprehension. Moron.<br />
<br />
4.) If you were unsure about BfA and decided to pay for a 6 month sub because of one mount that was coming later anyway well then that's on you, not Blizzard. So again - Moron.<br />
<br />
5.) If you think Blizzard is shadey because they put a mount on the store that they told you outright they were going to put on the store at a later date well yeah, you're a moron.<br />
<br />
I think that covers it. Have a nice day :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Daemos daemonium, rhorle<br />
<br />
I can agree, cheating wasn't the best word for that. No denial that they said the mount is going to be relaunched in the shop. <br />
And nope, it's not about twisting the facts. They already knew that BfA is not going well, so they released this 6-months sub pass. People could make their decision freely, fully agree. From personal experienced, had few friends who bought it and stopped playing. Blizzard simply wanted to get the money in advance, before people decide to retire. This is simple as that. And it's smart. But also disgusting when we take into account the fact, that they released 3 shop mounts within 4 months: Vulpine Familiar, Hogrus and now The Dreadwake. In the meantime they released 2 toys.<br />
<br />
Now, if I bought the 6 months pass, I would at least expect some decency, that they launch The Dreadwake after these 6 months. But nope. So yeah, it is a bait. Blizzard is being bombarded like never before, especially when it comes to microtransactions. But they do not really care much about it, since they have enough impudance to flood the shop with shit :) how many more mounts are they going to release this year?<br />
<br />
And yeah, cashing money worth 2 months of playing for a mount is another story for another time.<br />
And be aware, that they intentionally inflate the market, so that people are willing to buy gold for cash and buy in-game mounts (gryphons worth 50k). If they really cared for the market, they would go with quests for 100g in the first place. Pathetic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It still isn't bait. They offered a promotion for paying for a 6-month sub. Otherwise you would have to pay for the mount ahead of time. Stop blaming Blizzard because players are unable to accept resonability for their own purchases. There was no bait and switch. Everything about the promotion was clear. You get it for free or you wait till some time in 2019 to buy it.<br />
<br />
Also some people are already off of their 6-month promotion. I have been off it for around a month now. The promotion first began on 9/19/2018. They put the mount on the store on 4/23/2019. That is more then a 180 day difference. 216 days if I am not mistaken in math somewhere. That is 36 days over the amount of subscription you were required to purchase.<br />
<br />
You are also ranting about gold sinks as well? Because that is why 50k gryphons, 1 million pets, and the auction mount exist. To take gold out. Blizzard inflated the amount of gold the last two expansions. BfA is an attempt to correct it. It sucks if you didn't make easy gold while you could.</div></div><hr />

Litteraly no one was cheated. They told us it was coming back if any thing people played them selfs for subbing to a game they didn’t like bu that’s not blizzards fault.<br />
<br />
Mount was free if you purchased 6 months which the price varies depending on your countries currency. Can take 25$ or 32$ in my currency exchange rate and just remove it from my book and add it to balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As pointed out, it's past the 6 month period now.<br />
<br />
And on top of that, if someone really wanted the mount but to also quit the game in the mean time, it would have been cheaper to quit for the 6 months, and just buy the mount outright.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I'm really confused as to this kinda complaint.</div></div><hr />

There is no malice to the tactic here. People who bought a 6 month sub got the mount for free. THAT is the incentive, not the exclusivity. Anyone saying otherwise is being dishonest.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, they didn't have to release it later - but that is where people have the right to claim shady behavior. Nobody would assume they'd release it literally right around the time the 6 month sub thing ended.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard knew entirely what they were doing here.<br />
<br />
I'm currently majoring in Marketing / Economics and there are a crap ton of buzzwords placed in the original announcement to make the buyer think they're getting an exclusive purchase.<br />

<br />
Right but you also have to factor in the start time. Some might still be on and some will be off. They even gave the mount to people that had a auto-renew six month prior to the bundle offer. So plenty of people would have been off for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you bought the 6 month sub, you saved money compared to month to month, and the 25$ this mount now costs. They also said it would be coming back, who cares how soon, if you bought the 6 months you saved money.<br />
<br />
But yeah, no, Blizzard just wants your money, they only enticed people to pay less sub money and gave them a free mount for it. If a mount enticed you to sub for 6 months when you wouldn't have otherwise, you're addicted to this game and should step away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The boat cost zero. So the amount for the boat is $0. Do you mean the amount for the six month subscription? Because you paid for a 6-month subscription and got a free mount, hence $0. So maybe focus less on people looking foolish and more on clearly stating what you mean instead of saying the complete opposite.<br />

Technically the boat did not cost 0$. It was bound to the 6month subscription fee. Better luck next time.</div></div><hr />
