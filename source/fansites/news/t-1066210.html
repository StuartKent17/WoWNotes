Blue Posts<br />
Talent Tree Homogenization<br />
There is homogenization that is good for the game, and homogenization that is bad for the game.<br />
<br />
Consider Blood Lust/Heroism and Rebirth (battle rez). Those are very powerful abilities and probably mandatory for raiding. If shaman and druids were the only classes that brought them still, then every 10-player raid group would need a shaman and druid to be successful. In a game with 10-player raids and 11 classes, that means someone is excluded. Even worse, if yours is the guild with 2 really good rogues or hunters, you are going to have to make the choice to sit one of those players out in order to be optimal. Even if that hunter is a really nice guy or a good player, he can't come because you need Blood Lust. We don't think that's fun, and we know a lot of players agree. There are several abilities in this mandatory or near-mandatory category: interrupts, raid buffs, dispels and so on. We have no problems spreading those around, or homogenizing the abilities that mean groups can bring the player they want to.<br />
<br />
The other category though is making each class feel a bit different when you play them. These are abilities or mechanics that tend to make your class or spec feel unique, but aren't mandatory. There are a lot of these in the game: Chakra, Cauterize, Bladestorm, Demonic Circle, etc. There are of course still going to be healing, survival, damage and movement abilities in the game that are equivalent in their effect as another classes' ability, but they all work a little differently, and hopefully make you feel different when you group with other characters or play different alts. It's important to us to protect those differences in the game.

<br />
Character and Creature Model Quality<br />
We've acknowledged that the old character models could do with a revamp, and we're planning to get this done. But the point several of you raised about system requirements holds true; we want WoW to be accessible to those with older machines as well as those of you with top-end gaming rigs.

The MMO Report (http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/tag/3321/the-mmo-report/) is back after the holidays, and we definitely did not forget about Casey, mostly. He is back this week to tell you about DC Universe Online, the Firefly MMO, and his ever popular Mail Bag! <br />

That'll be kind of hard to do, since mmo-champion re-hashes what Blizzard posts and does not, in fact, make the actual decisions/posts at Blizzard what needs the re-hashing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its even better when they site bladestorm as something that isn't homogenized and then we see Felguards felstorming and Monks Spinning Crane Kicking.<br />
<br />
Yes homogenization is needed. On mandatory abilities. Giving out the very few unique warrior abilities like they're free candy isn't a good form of homogenization. Giving other classes smokebomb/ring of frost or removing the two altogether is a good form of homogenization.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never understood this. The game works with older machines. so what's wrong with the OPTION of having the new models / textures. Blizzard can cater to those with top-end rigs and still make the game run on lower end machines by giving an OPTIONAL setting to go to extreme settings. Always the same bullshit excuse imo.</div></div><hr />

Just tune different the difficulty..make different the drop (like toc 10 and 25...icc 10 and 25)..so 10 group can do all without some buff.<br />
At the moment we have 10 men raids where difficulty is minor than 25 where you need dps like hell and same for heals.. Ultraxion hero 25 men need 40k each average dps, Ultraxion 10 need 32..33k....not the same thing...but drop same items..<br />
Look the guilds..all now go in raid with 10 players....few guilds continue to raid in 25 (mine among which)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It took them 1 game, and 3 expansions to finally realise that &quot;it was not fun to be everyone's buff bitch&quot;. Yeah sure, so go ahead and spread our buffs away but then what do the Shaman excel in now?</div></div><hr />

There was a need to spread our bloodlust, but giving it to mages was the worst option. Giving it to the hunter was also another bad idea imo, this truly made mages too good. And the most sickening annoying part of it is, they even gave the mage a self buff when they casted it thus getting a superior version of the spell. Typical anyway, that when they give something unique to us, they make it even better then before.</div></div><hr />

Honestly that pretty much sums it up in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Mandatory for raiding! Therefore these abilities will now be granted at level 60! Woop woop!<br />
