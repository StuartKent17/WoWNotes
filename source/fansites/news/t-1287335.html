Patch 5.3 - Heroic Scenarios<br />
A few things have changed since the last time we looked at Heroic Scenarios (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3183-Heroic-Scenarios-Scenario-Steps-Mar-27-Hotfixes-Blue-Posts-Sound-Design-Comic). <br />
<br />
Your first Heroic Scenario of the day now offers 120 Valor Points for completion and just 30 Valor Points for completing the bonus objectives. You will also earn a http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/98134.jpg Heroic Cache of Treasures (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/98134-heroic-cache-of-treasures), which has a chance to drop epic item level 516 gear (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=16758&amp;filter-ilvl-min=516&amp;filter-ilvl-max=516&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=90). <br />
<br />
Doing another scenario after the first reverts to the old http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/92813.jpg Greater Cache of Treasures (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/92813-greater-cache-of-treasures) and 70 Valor Points / 30 Valor Points for the bonus. <br />
<br />
The scenarios are still difficult, but a healer makes them them trivial to do. However, this means you give up the bonus objective, as it requires a very high amount of DPS to complete. The patch notes still say that a group is required to join, but you are currently still able to queue solo!<br />

<br />
Patch 5.3 - Challenge Mode Daily Quest Reward<br />
Patch 5.3 adds another reason for some players to attempt challenge modes with the addition of a http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/98134.jpg Heroic Cache of Treasures (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/98134-heroic-cache-of-treasures) to the Challenge Mode Daily Quests (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/dungeons?filter-search=A+Worthy+Challenge). This gives you a chance at the item level 516 loot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=16758&amp;filter-ilvl-min=516&amp;filter-ilvl-max=516&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=90), better than what you can get from Raid Finder!<br />

Patch 5.3 - Titan's Grip and Polearms<br />
Ghostcrawler has been updating us on which tooltip changes are just fixes recently, so take a look at the last patch notes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3210-Patch-5-3-PTR-Build-16837-Patch-5-3-PTR-Notes-April-11-Update) again to see what has changed! He also mentioned that Titan's Grip with Polearms is unlikely to make Patch 5.3, even though it appears to work (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/april/poleTG.jpg).<br />

Dungeons and Heroic Scenarios<br />
Dungeons and scenarios just aren't equal in the time and effort required to create them. Dungeons and raids, however, are equal in the time and effort required. When looking at the current progression landscape we have to say ok, is it worth cutting down on the size of the next raid so we can have a new dungeon? Is that what will benefit players most and create the best experience? When you consider the progression path right now, which requires a few dungeons and then hop-skip-jumping to Throne of Thunder in about a week, what is to gain from additional dungeons, and does that warrant cutting large amounts of content from future raids?<br />
<br />
I don't think there are any silver-bullet answers to that, different players want different types of content, but we make decisions on what we believe the majority of players will benefit from most, and what is overall best for the experience of the game. Certainly some people will say they don't care about raids, or they'd prefer a raid be half the size so they can have a new dungeon. There's not going to be a full consensus on these kinds of things. On anything, really.<br />
<br />
With Heroic Scenarios we can give some of that dungeon experience with difficult encounters, they require coordination, there are some stretch goals, and competitive rewards. We'd like to see if we can take the experience of a dungeon and present it in another way, and see if it scratches that same itch. We'll be interested to hear what people think once they try them.<br />
<br />
So we faceroll content for a week and jump to the last tier? I hope I don't strain myself in this epic adventure. <br />
The majority of people coming in mid-expansion want to try to catch up to where everyone else is. You can take your time, if you like; really experience everything the expansion has to offer up to this point, but we want to ensure people can catch up in a relatively quick amount of time if they want to so they can have fun with their friends/guilds - or at least see some of the newest content. It's going to really come down to drops. One week is probably unlikely for many.<br />
<br />
Why is creating large raids AND lots of 5 mans so hard now compared to the Wrath/ BC days? <br />
Because those examples remove the context of time. A lot of the content that released through the lifetime of BC and Wrath was in development before those expansions released, and was intended as launch content. It was delayed and finished off later. Not to mention the life cycles of those expansions was just much, much longer than where we are now. I think there's a misunderstanding that development cycles are much shorter than they actually are, or that we don't begin work on the next patch until the current one is released. With 5.2 we heard that people wanted to see some additional dungeons, but even if we began working on them then you probably wouldn't actually see them until long after 5.4 where they wouldn't make sense any longer.<br />
<br />
But we can make Scenario content relatively quickly, we think Heroic Scenarios can get at that same kind of gameplay, and we'll have to see how everyone likes the additional challenge. Like I said we don't think it's going to be a replacement for dungeons, or will appeal to every single player, but we hope it's something everyone will at least try and we look forward to hearing what you think. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/258856-sowho-asked-for-heroic-scenarios/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8569599266?page=7#125))<br />
<br />
Heroic Scenarios and Dungeons<br />
On patch 5.3 scenarios are getting some cool upgrades (such as heroic mode) as well as new and improved rewards, so hopefully that'll make them more attractive for you Stono.<br />
<br />
We still like 5-man dungeons and there will be more in coming expansions, but right now, the developers feel the content they're currently working on (raids with their varying difficulty modes (LFR, normal, Heroic) normal and Heroic scenarios, world bosses, quest content...) for this expansion's cycle is more attractive to a bigger number of players.<br />
<br />
I just wish more of the dungeons we have would be available when leveling. <br />
In patch 5.3 the developers are going to tweak at which point dungeons are made available on the whole level 1-90 range.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see every single scenario out of the window for 2-3 more 5 man dungeons. Scenarios all come down to the same thing: You kill some stuff, do a few objectives and that's it. There are no real mechanics you have to deal with (Oh you mean those big elite 'bosses'?). It's outright boring, and adding a Heroic mode and giving it more rewards will definitely not attract more people to this obnoxious form of PvE. <br />
I realize plenty of you don't care about Scenarios as they are right now. Which is alright, to be frank, I usually run them just for valor, so that sentiment some people may have in the sense of &quot;these aren't quite useful for me&quot; it's not alien to me.<br />
<br />
However, having said that, keep in mind Heroic scenarios are indeed harder and tuned to a higher item level. There'll be new rewards and items as well coming from them, so, while I completely understand you might not like them as they are right now, I'd encourage you to go to the PTR as the patch continues to be developed and see how Heroic scenarios are shaping up. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/258836-lack-of-5-mans-in-mop/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7257297567?page=2#35))<br />
<br />
Ra-den Difficulty<br />
Well the limited attempts made it one of the longer races to be sure. Whether it was more difficult than others, maybe not(?), but difficulty is in the eye of the beholder. We've had bugged or overtuned bosses in the past that were essentially impossible to beat, but for those not involved sometimes that turns from &quot;impossible&quot; to &quot;an epic struggle!&quot;<br />
<br />
Probably most important though is that while the world first race is awesome and we all love watching it and seeing who wins, we still want the fights to be possible for high-end progression raids that are not vying for world firsts. We're not trying to make boss fights impossible for the sake of tripping everyone up and laughing as no one can kill them for months. We can make impossible bosses. That's not the point, though. Bosses are made to die.

In-game Support Site Access and Tools in 5.3<br />
I know your impulse is to not share any of this, but it's going to be figured out eventually. You may as well make it easy for the people who want to help to find issues before the people who want to exploit it find something to take advantage of.<br />
We’re glad that there are so many who want to help test the functionality of this new system and appreciate the questions. You’re right that the development team is continuing to take player privacy and security very seriously. Here’s what we can answer for you:<br />
<br />
I know this is a trade off between security and useful testing, but can/will you tell us anything about the browser tech you're using? Which rendering engine, etc? <br />
We’re using the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) for the browser functionality within the system.<br />
<br />
Is it going to have access to any of the active game information (for example, will you need to log in to the Customer Service website while you're in the game, or will the game authentication somehow be passed through?<br />
We plan to have a single sign on process, which will alleviate the need to re-authenticate. We plan to have this implemented in the near future.<br />
<br />
Will the character currently logged in be automatically selected, game state information be captured for ticket data, or client logs be available to include (or automatically included) with ticket submission? <br />
Tickets will capture some data relevant for Customer Service to be able to work effectively such as a player’s location for ‘stuck’ bugs (which allows a GM to teleport to the player location.) This is done on the backend. <br />
<br />
Where will browser session information be stored on the local PC? Will any of it persist between game sessions?<br />
We are minimizing the amount data stored on player’s machines and the data we persist between sessions. The browser will not be able to access ‘general purpose’ sites.<br />
<br />
The most important thing to keep in mind is that this system is being devised not to remove GM assistance when it’s needed. It’s meant to make it easier for those that want to find “self-help” options without the need to contact Customer Support should they wish to.

<br />
Thats a bit short sighted.<br />
<br />
Remember when they implemented new 5mans in cataclysm halfway the expansion. people were sick and tired of running the same 2 or 3 dungeons all the time (first ZA/ZG, later the 3 caverns of time dungeons) and there was MASSIVE complaining.</div></div><hr />

If 5 mans dungeons have no purpose then neither do scenarios.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main problem I see with Scenarios, currently, is that their stories are kinda like very unimportant but-somewhat-related-to-lore sideshows.<br />
<br />
Case in point: All the brewing-centric ones (Unga Ingoo, Brewing Storm, etc). Greenstone village. Yawn. That stuff should have been zone quests.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The scenarios I enjoy most are plot-centric ones. The Vol'jin scenario is great! The alliance equivalent is not nearly as interesting because there's little or no story, just, &quot;OMG everything is under attack quick kill people.&quot; <br />
<br />
We were told that scenarios were going to be a way for Blizz to do some storytelling that they wouldn't fit in otherwise. My question is this--how many of these stories were worth telling in the first place?<br />
<br />
I'm also not seeing how SHORT (3 bosses, tops) dungeons would be that much more work than scenarios, tbh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you read the bluepost? They said doing new dungeons takes a lot of time and if they started now they were ready after 5.4 is released. Also Blizzard doesn't want us to use dungeons or scenarios to quickly gear up for the newest content.<br />
<br />
Making scenarios is quick because all the things needed are already done. They always use the same mobs and areas and only need to do some scripting and they're finished. Dungeons on the other hand need at least the dungeon in itself which is more work than doing some scenarios and when looking at dungeons from the past they want to do also mobs, bosses and gear that fits the dungeon.<br />
<br />
As they said it's about what fits most to the playerbase. You want more dungeons? OK, but you won't get content as fast as now. Instead of a new raid you would get a new set of dungeons (maybe 2-3) so that one raid tier would last like 10 months or you get smaller raids.<br />
<br />
I think investing more time into the raid tier and adding some quick and dirty scenarios for people who don't raid is better for everyone especially since heroic dungeons are just normal lvl90 dungeons and nothing special anymore. The raid tiers so far are great and the filler patches are great too with story progression and all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand. Are you saying there's absolutely no way for, say, an Enhancement Shaman, to beat a Mage in a duel? Given that both players are equally good?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shambulanced</div><div class="date">2013-04-13, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also Blizzard doesn't want us to use dungeons or scenarios to quickly gear up for the newest content....<br />
<br />
Yet the heroic scenarios give better valor, and a chance at 516 loot. So they are a catch-up mechanic.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Making scenarios is quick because all the things needed are already done. They always use the same mobs and areas and only need to do some scripting and they're finished. Dungeons on the other hand need at least the dungeon in itself which is more work than doing some scenarios and when looking at dungeons from the past they want to do also mobs, bosses and gear that fits the dungeon. <br />
<br />
So they can't do the same with dungeons? God never descended from the sky and said, &quot;LO, BLIZZARD, BEHOLD THESE COMMANDMENTS: THOU SHALT ALWAYS CREATE 100% NEW CONTENT FOR DUNGEONS, THOU SHALT HAND OUT BAGS OF GOLD LIKE CANDY IN THE LFR OR LOOT THE PERSON ALREADY HAS RATHER THAN THE DROP THEY'VE WANTED FOR MONTHS, THOU SHALT BALANCE AND TWEAK CLASSES IN PVE BASED ON PVP BALANCE ATTEMPTS, etc etc etc&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
These defenses make little to no sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way I see it, most Scenarios take place in locations that already exist in the world, while dungeons have to be created from scratch in their own instance. So it requires creating new terrain, layouts, new bosses, trash packs, and then balancing it all for a group of 5-man to be able to down confidently and quickly, without too many issues based on Class comp, etc.<br />
<br />
With Scenarios, you just copy the area you want, paste it into a new instance, sprinkle some mobs and quest objectives here and there, and then throw down a boss or two. So designing a Scenario is like making some new quests, designing a dungeon is like making an entire new zone from scratch.<br />
<br />
Something like that...</div></div><hr />

The reasons why they're so easy to create are the same reasons why they're so boring. They just feel like group quests, whereas five-mans feel like theme parks. I don't like that they're accepted as a replacement for five-mans, as if interesting, medium-length (compared to raids) content isn't necessary to maintain their momentum.</div></div><hr />

They are NOT accepted as a replacement for five-mans, but some people can see that we can't have everything.<br />
<br />
Blizzard have time and time again said the large unique raid tiers in a quicker time span with LFR is the reason we are not getting more 5 mans NOT scenarios.<br />
<br />
If my choice was say....<br />
<br />
Ulduar (amazing large raid) - Preceded by Naxx (rehash) and followed by ToC (nice bosses nothing else)<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
ICC (very good and large raid) and 3 5 mans - for 13 months<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Large unique raid tiers (T14 = 16 bosses, T15 = 13 bosses, T16 = ? bosses) for hopefully 6 months each.<br />
<br />
The choice to me is clear.<br />
<br />
I would love more 5 mans but I appreciate that we can't have everything.<br />
<br />
All I hear is ./cry &quot;I want everything and I want it NOW&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
to be fair, 5.1 and 5.3 are designed to be filler (i.e. something to do while waiting for the next raid cycle) and a time to level alts or catch up on PvP. <br />
<br />
The problem with that is PvP gear resets at .2 (and .4 probably) so catching up in .1 and .3 will leave you forever behind. similarly with alts, as people get their mains further and further into ToT LFR runs and IoT dailies Leveling alts and getting them geared is less and less appealing (especially with raggin-fraggin Golden Lotus dailies as a barrier to the &quot;fun&quot; dailies)<br />
<br />
I do agree though, that any full patch without a raid should have dungeons to speed up gearing. So, ideally, 5.0 raids, 5.1 have Lion's Landing, Dagger in the Dark, and the quarry daily zone be dungeons. 5.2 raid, 5.3 Heroic Ragefire Chasm and Heroic Stocks, 5.4 raid<br />
<br />
My game theory degree twinged a bit when, a week or two ago, they said dungeons take people on the raid team and scenarios take people on the quest team. Which does explain why scenarios feel like group quests. Maybe they should have four separate groups instead of two?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would have gladly accepted dungeons in any of the four patches, as they were in every other expansion. I don't think it's an unreasonable request for them to not throw the baby out with the bath water just because some people like raids more. If they think this is going to be a positive thing for them in subscription numbers then they're welcome to play that hand. I think it's a losing one, though.</div></div><hr />

I would. I don't have the time to raid, nor do I find it as enjoyable as running five-mans.<br />
<br />
Five-mans and raids use the same development teams, but there are many subscribers who don't have time to raid - thus, these players are left with filler. It's a problem that will catch up with them soon.</div></div><hr />

While I don't doubt you, but you do 5 mans but don't do LFR?<br />
<br />
Is it not better to have say 8-9 wings of LFR + 6 scenerios instead of 3 new 5 mans in the same time span, I don't really understand this logic.<br />
<br />
Will you really stay subbed for 13 months doing the same 3 5 mans over and over again?<br />

LFR is dependent on too many people to not drop or wipe for me to reliably complete it in the same period of time that I can reliably complete a five-man in. I have a long list of alts that I can cycle through the five-mans with as I fill out their gear over a long period. The five-mans give me something substantial to keep up with on a regular basis, and I can pair them with the miscellanious bits such as dailies and crafting - which aren't, in themselves, reasons to stay subbed and logged in regularly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not exactly... but there is a bit of &quot;truth&quot; in part of what you said.<br />
Buying packs will assure you a bigger supply of cards and diversity faster then if you win them by winning games. So if you buy packs the chance of you getting the cards you want and respective copies of them faster then people that don't buy packs will be almost 100% (it's never 100% but high enough). So people that get most/all the cards they want for a deck will have an advantage over people that have to scratch a deck with &quot;non ideal cards&quot; or less copies of them... this is assuming same level of skill/knowledge of both players.<br />
This doesn't mean you can't win against a player that buy cards... just means his deck may be more consistent then yours, until you catch up on the cards and copies needed for w/e deck you want to build.<br />
Overall when playing with a built deck, they may have an advantage on the early stages after the game release.<br />
<br />
It's just like in rl games, where buying packs of cards normally assures you a more consistent deck, then one made from a more restricted pool of cards.</div></div><hr />

Hey, I love this game as much as the next guy. I'm not being unreasonable, just pointing out fairly sizable gap in content that this expansion hasn't filled.

We really must be playing two different games.<br />
<br />
I did both wings of MV and HoF (4 in total) in about an hour and a half on Weds.<br />
<br />
Is 5.1 LFR a bit of a nightmare sure I can see that especially Durumu.<br />

It's a lot easier to coach the person who's having trouble in a five-man than it is the five-ten people in LFR. The wait in LFR when a raid falls apart, or when a couple of healers leave, can be excessive, and you may just end up having to do the whole thing again. I've had evenings where I couldn't finish a wing. Granted this was months ago, but I don't have the time or patience for that again.<br />
<br />
As far as ZA/ZG, I don't feel like they were very good dungeons to have been released in the first place. It took them forever to tune them right, and it was all just rehashed content anyway. The final Cataclysm dungeons that came were better, though they may have gone a little far in the other direction, difficulty wise. I never minded HoR, but people did drop a lot.</div></div><hr />

A catch-up mechanic. That'd be like calling doing the 100 meter dash in a wheelchair a competitive strategy. lol<br />
<br />
These items are something that can only be acquired from scenarios once per day...which have a tiny chance at dropping a single, randomly itemized piece of gear...and this helps catch people up? That's a fucking joke. Scenarios are nothing but a bullet in their list of &quot;features&quot;, that is all, and how many people will actually give a shit about &quot;heroic&quot; scenarios? OH MAN, SOME MORE VALOR POINTS. How many people did challenge modes? Almost none, and there was an actual incentive (transmog gear). But Blizzard, in spite of &quot;feedback&quot; they receive will continue shitting them out because it's easier to do. Dungeons are going away because they're too much work and because they'd rather cop out and say 'well, we want players to run lfr 30 times before they can catch up. because that makes sense. cause that's how we really feel guiz, not because we're pulling jedi-mindtricks that half the sheepish player base will actuall believe!!1&quot;</div></div><hr />

I didn't realise people would get so but-hurt over such a mundane task. I'm not saying LFR or scenario's are better but dungeons send me to sleep almost.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathranis</div><div class="date">2013-04-13, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, and here's the thing about scenarios, dungeons, and raids: dungeons and raids are handled by two teams, one which is responsible for level design (creating the dungeons) and one which is responsible for encounters (creating the bosses). Creating a dungeon means not just designing a layout, but completely designing the dungeon, painting the texture maps, placing the doodads, and ultimately incorporating the whole thing into the world, now that flying mounts are available (unless it's a literal dungeon or a cave). And then the encounter designers come in to design and balance the boss fights.<br />
<br />
Scenarios, on the flip side, can be made by any team working on the game. They're easy to design. A lot of them were designed by the quest team as a way to convey important story points. So Blizzard can easily make 2-5 scenarios every patch without affecting raid design at all. If they were to implement 2-3 new heroics, that means that the next raid tier would probably be a couple wings smaller.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another thing to consider is what role post-launch heroics actually play in progression. Historically, they've been introduced in seperate heroic tiers with better gear, used as a catch-up mechanic so people could more quickly access the current tier of raid content. With the introduction of Raid Finder, this is not necessary. Instead of running the same 2-3 &quot;new heroics&quot; over and over to gear up for the latest raid tier, you do the complete raid progression in LFR, and technically speaking, I'd say four seperate wings of LFR ToT is plenty of new content to &quot;farm&quot;<br />

They've been using artificial gating since Classic.<br />
<br />
What do you think attunement was? Pretty much everything through 2.4 was gated behind attunements. Even heroics were gated in BC, as you had to get keys to unlock them. In 2.4 they used literal gates in SP (the final wing of SP didn't open up until a month after 2.4 launched).<br />
<br />
The Gates of Ahn'Qiraj were also a form of very literal gating, which should be obvious to anyone with half a brain. Yet most people still act like it was one of the best &quot;events&quot; Blizzard ever made. Of course, a lot of people are still begging for attunements to return, too.</div></div><hr />

Thank you. I really enjoyed playing this instance back when I was closer to its level. Unfortunately, if they were to re-do this instance, I'm sure they would water it down and not do it justice (see: Blackrock Caverns).</div></div><hr />

<br />
noone in my guild wants to do scenarios.<br />
<br />
you know why we arent getting 5-mans? laziness. or blizzard doesnt want to hire more people than they need. IMO they are mailing it in because they sent people to work on Titan. all we will get till the new expansion is dailies and a raid every 6-8 months.<br />
<br />
yawn. dailies of pandaria indeed.<br />
<br />
To be honest, my guildies only do a random hc and a scenario 2-3 a week for the cap. If they add heroic scenario's they will probably end up doing it. Mainly because they are still quicker then a random heroic. They will prolly drop those all together in favor of hc scenarios. Wich is good. It gives better insentive to do a quick hc scenario (loot, achieves, vp bonus) then to do a long-ish heroic dungeon again and again. It might even benefit alts much more.<br />
Also, they gave their reasons on why they do not add new dungeons. We don't need your opinion over their fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you think attunement was? Pretty much everything through 2.4 was gated behind attunements. Even heroics were gated in BC, as you had to get keys to unlock them. In 2.4 they used literal gates in SP (the final wing of SP didn't open up until a month after 2.4 launched).<br />
<br />
The Gates of Ahn'Qiraj were also a form of very literal gating, which should be obvious to anyone with half a brain. Yet most people still act like it was one of the best &quot;events&quot; Blizzard ever made. Of course, a lot of people are still begging for attunements to return, too.<br />
<br />
I guess your right, that is actual artificial gating. What they use now now is just blantant gating, nothing artificial about it. I'd rather spend my time out in the game world farming resist gear for an epic raid boss than get a post on the WoW forums telling me to pay the same $15 a month to sit on my butt and do nothing until they release it to LFR. <br />
<br />
And no i'm not inclined to to normal or heroic because whats the difference....its the same art as LFR and it just gets worse having to do it 3 times.</div></div><hr />

It's a really cool way to make more content (like 5mans) and allows them to also spend time on scenarios. But of course, you don't make as much profit cause you have to actually pay these new people you hire. So I can see why it's so hard for them to do so.<br />

Hey Blizz, if the game still had challenging content that took months to complete instead of days, you would have a longer expansion cycles. Its your own fault that your content is so easy that its obsolete as soon as its released.<br />
<br />
Link your heroic RaDen kill or stfu.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think there are a lot of people that want new 5 mans so they can skip to the last tier of content after spamming them for a day. I would just like more variety after doing the same 9 dungeons for the whole expansion. I dont really care what ilvl loot they drop. Id also like if they made lvl88-89 versions of Niuzo and Gate to make leveling easier, especially if you dont want to quest.<br />
<br />
Since they arent going to make new 5 mans the best way to quickly gear up will be to farm JP/HP, buy honor PvP gear, buy the highest ilvl valor gear you can, run new LFR, buy BoEs, raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
honestly, getting people to run LFR 100 times just so they can meet the t16 ilvl requirement gets old really fast. exaggerating, sure, but it seems like the only end-game content is raids. thats IT.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you can only get one box a day. So way to talk smack as if I could have tried harder when that is all Blizz lets you do. Did it on 3 toons for a month now. So actually 3 times a day for a month, and not one epic from a box. Now if you feel doing something for 3 months and not getting a reward for it is worth it, then we both play the game for different reasons. I can see 1 a week or maybe 1 every 10 days being a better drop rate.</div></div><hr />

So now it's 3 toons...first it was 2....soon your next reply will be 4. First off...do you understand what a low droprate is? You aren't 'meant' to get epics in scenarios, it's a bonus....it's mainly an alternate way of getting valor, which to entitlement generation folks like you, is your guaranteed gear. 2nd...quit acting like it takes more than 15 minutes to do a scenario, and you're putting SO much time into it. You're the type to gripe regardless what they do. You're not relying on those scenario epics to get gear, so if you don't like it, don't do it. I like them as an insta Q for dps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monomania</div><div class="date">2013-04-14, 03:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, and here's the thing about scenarios, dungeons, and raids: dungeons and raids are handled by two teams, one which is responsible for level design (creating the dungeons) and one which is responsible for encounters (creating the bosses). Creating a dungeon means not just designing a layout, but completely designing the dungeon, painting the texture maps, placing the doodads, and ultimately incorporating the whole thing into the world, now that flying mounts are available (unless it's a literal dungeon or a cave). And then the encounter designers come in to design and balance the boss fights.<br />
<br />
Scenarios, on the flip side, can be made by any team working on the game. They're easy to design. A lot of them were designed by the quest team as a way to convey important story points. So Blizzard can easily make 2-5 scenarios every patch without affecting raid design at all. If they were to implement 2-3 new heroics, that means that the next raid tier would probably be a couple wings smaller.<br />
<br />
I understand that they are developed by the same teams and that dungeons have been marginalized by Blizzard. I'm saying this was their mistake - not including five-mans as a crucial step on the gearing ladder. There's no reason they can't be important, Blizzard simply chose to just include LFR versions of the raid wings instead since they can just retune the raid they've already developed, rather than develop new dungeons. The people who don't like raiding but enjoy dungeons as one of the primary features of the patches are left with nothing worth subbing for.</div></div><hr />

Unless i'm crazy, but im sure currently every scenario you do, whenever, gives you a Greater Cache of Treasures. Not just once a day -_-<br />

WOW was once the king of holy trinity gaming. Its no longer. Neverwinter will have a good following cause it has very strong holy trinity dungeon system. SWTOR just released an expansion that has some very well done operations and trinity content. WOW simply does not have that anymore.</div></div><hr />

Why are you complaining about a lootbag everyone will get regardless of class/spec? You can do hc scenario with whatever class/spec. Will you meet the vp bonus objective? Maybe not. You still get the bag.<br />
Challenge modes are maybe easier for some classes or specs, but it does not mean it can not be done by others.</div></div><hr />

My complain is based on the blatant ignorance from BLizzard to create quality trinity content for smaller groups. Instead to try to drag ppl into none trinity content that most agree is just well below par of what is acceptable in terms of co-op quality. Heroic versions will not change that.</div></div><hr />

For now it won't be easy, mostly because every guild out there thinks that if a new raid is released they are forced to do the new shinny raid.<br />
