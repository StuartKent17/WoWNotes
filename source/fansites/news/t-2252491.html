Both Method (https://twitter.com/Methodsco/status/883653795267457024) and Exorsus (https://twitter.com/ExorsusWoW/status/883750110336823298) have tweeted about the difficulty of the Kil'jaeden encounter. Method is also doing coverage (https://www.method.gg/raidprogress) of the race! <br />

<br />
Uhm, that's bullshit. Prot warriors were kind of a mixed bag at the start of the expansion, then later got a huge buff with the class update and the addition of devastator and after all that got some very minor nerfs. Current prot warriors are way stronger than they have been at the start of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

No they are right. Prot warrior was massively overpowered at the start. Then they got nerfed hard and have never fully recovered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's as if they didn't play at classic. 2H warriors were frightening, even more-so in PvP. Arcanite Reaper anyone? Arms Warriors with raiding gear did pretty well. I still remember how our main Arms Warrior obtained Sulfuras and just cleaved through everything like butter.<br />
<br />
Also disappointed that there's no mention of the Prot Warrior damage buff patch in WotLK. Best patch ever for Prot Warriors (I had been Prot since MC). I could finally kill stuff so fast, that day I had the most fun in WoW since ages.</div></div><hr />

From the launch of Cataclysm through our journey to Pandaria and back to Draenor, there were no great alterations.<br />
<br />
How do you have an entire article about how warriors have evolved since vanilla, and then just gloss over rage mechanics (both in generation and in spending) being completely reworked arguably the largest change to the way the class was played that has ever happened, as &quot;no great alterations&quot;?<br />
<br />
Also a complete removal of stance requirements for abilities is just &quot;minor quality of life&quot; as a change guys.<br />
<br />
Good grief. Nothing really of note happened in Japan 1945 except for the firebombing of Tokyo and two minor nuclear explosions.</div></div><hr />

Only certain spells have the new casting animations, literally all other spells have the old race specific ones. I think it's nice and makes casting animations less monotonous.</div></div><hr />

I like the new animation that has the player lean forward for Dragon's Breath. The rest of the changes are &quot;meh&quot; at best, though, with the different sound for Pyroblast being the worst (I keep expecting an ice-based spell).<br />
<br />
Arcane mage:<br />
Like the new Arcane Barrage, but don't like new Arcane Explosion nor Arcane missiles at all.<br />
<br />
Frost mage:<br />
I like the changes, with the exception of Flurry. The new sound for Flurry is good, but they should leave the animation unchanged.</div></div><hr />

Aside from Ignore Pain warriors play almost worse than they did in Vanilla. No rendition of post-WotLK Warrior was fun except MoP Arms and WoD Gladiator. The fun of Fury was finding silly weapon combos (like dual felstriker) and tearing people a new hole within burst windows, or simply beating people to death with your fists after being disarmed. Post-merger class devs are trash.</div></div><hr />

I also found the declaration of Gladiator Stance a &quot;failed experiment&quot; hilarious, especially considering they reference to it being quite capable immediately after.

Didn't know that. I've never had a shammy so wouldn't of noticed.<br />
But still it doesn't take away the fact they could of been a little more creative.<br />
Hopefully they don't make warlocks ones just as bad but i guess we will have to wait and see after patch 7.3 or whenever they said they would get round to it.</div></div><hr />

I don't remember bothering to go far down to shield slam, it did terrible damage and threat. You picked up what you needed (including last stand) and went mostly into arms. Threat also wasn't an issue if you specced correctly, the major issue was initial threat and spike threat, Windfury totem mass procs and other warriors going ham from the start were issues of course, but as long as you made good use of your rage and dumped it frequently for threat you'd be ok.</div></div><hr />
