You can't cross-realm current tier. You can only cross-realm previous ones. So you can't cross-realm Throne of Thunder until next patch comes.</div></div><hr />

Stretching out LFR's release just because some &quot;hardcores&quot; whined about how they felt they had to run LFR to gear up for normals, after putting massive effort to make certain LFR gear wasn't really worth hardcore raiders having in the first place, is kind of a slap in the face to the vast majority of the people who play the game and who LFR is for. &quot;Oh, you can See The Content...Over Six Weeks.&quot; <br />

<br />
It's still your choice. You choose to raid with that guild or another guild who wouldn't require you to know the boss fights. Stop using Blizzard as the scapegoat for your lack of motivation to be prepared for your raid.<br />
<br />
In the end, complaining about not being able to do LFR just so you don't have to learn the boss fights is pretty damn ignorant. Especially considering that 90% of the bosses in LFR you completely ignore the mechanics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So don't watch the video and read the numerous guides on the fight. Just because you use LFR in this manner doesn't mean it was designed for that and it shouldn't be catered to yourself.<br />
<br />
If you don't understand why they delay LFR's release then I don't know what to tell you. They've stated numerous times every single raid patch this expansion as to why they do it this way. Just because you don't agree with it doesn't mean it doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're almost as delicious as the tears of the snowflake hardcores.<br />
<br />
I'm going to plod through normal in a month or so then finish heroic over the next two like usual so idc really.<br />
<br />
But from an unbiased view, it is pretty dumb to gate it that long. You're going to have the people that only do lfr do one wing, log out and in that two weeks they may decide it's not worth paying for. Same with people planning to only flex. (Which, if you haven't been paying attention, is about 90% of subscribers.)<br />
<br />
Huge gamble on Blizzards part.</div></div><hr />

..so ..yeah. Now they get LFR and they unsub. Why did they stay pre-LFR when they had NOTHING. But as usual, everybody knows better...yet nobody agress...but still claims to know better...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like in any multiplayer game, there must be some sort of award for doing something in a more challenging way, or showing skill while playing. Why can't it be the right to see the full content first? It's just one week.<br />
<br />
Besides, how is that hardcore? Hardcore player is the one who will spend 10 hours a day at HC release to be in top 50. Normal raiding is... the normal game, you know? Thats what raiding is all about - trial and error, attempting to complete an encounter with your guild, and the satisfaction of finally getting things right. And to achieve anything in normal raiding you could spend just 2 hours weekly on WoW, to slowly work on 1 or 2 bosses. If you decide that you don't wanna play the game, and instead spend way more than those 2 hours doing LFR over and over... Well, you're to blame.<br />
<br />
Although, I don't see much of a reason behind the Flex gating. It is raiding pretty much like on normal, but with a bit more forgiving tactics, and a great addition of flexible party size. Don't see a reason why shouldn't it be released all at once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wake up on the wrong side of the bed again?<br />
My guild is far from hardcore and we sit at 2/13 Hc the staggering of content of the people below even casual players is fine, either deal with it or don't bother crying about it on a forum</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because many will sub just for that then unsub, this way they guarantee more income. LFR has no challenge, so they have to artificially give you illusion of progression so the content last longer.<br />
<br />
That is the real reason, but they will tell you it's to make sure raiders don't burn out of running multiple formats on week 1.<br />
<br />
Plus let's be honest, nobody wants to see LFR heroes more geared than normal raiders, so it gives a chance to avoid that.</div></div><hr />

Also isn't the extremely low drop chance the artificial progress for lfr? like I've done lfr every week since 5.2 and i still don't have a 2nd trinket, belt or pants drop &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

Sounds like a whole lot of your problem. If you can't be bothered to watch a 6 minute video of a boss fight, then perhaps raiding isn't for you.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to plod through normal in a month or so then finish heroic over the next two like usual so idc really.<br />
<br />
But from an unbiased view, it is pretty dumb to gate it that long. You're going to have the people that only do lfr do one wing, log out and in that two weeks they may decide it's not worth paying for. Same with people planning to only flex. (Which, if you haven't been paying attention, is about 90% of subscribers.)<br />
<br />
Huge gamble on Blizzards part.<br />
<br />
ok so it's better to release it all at once, they finish it on Tuesday, and then log out till next expansion? or keep coming back as the new wings are unlocked.</div></div><hr />

Are you really serious, this entire expansion has been about the casual approach to the game.<br />
I am not hardcore, but a normal mode raider and will be running flex and lfr as well. I actually appreciate the gating as it allows me time to prepare. Even raiding normals, I will still end up killing Garosh on LFR before I even get to touch it on flex and normal.</div></div><hr />

I think that WoW is the last gasp of the linear content progression endgame model for MMOs. WoWs Raids are very cool and fun to experience once or twice.

<br />
This isn't about 'keeping subscribers artificially by gating the content'. This is about how guilds often 'force' their members to do everything that's available. Solution? Gate normal/heroic content? Or gate LFR/Flex? Or open everything at once with the knowledge that people will be 'forced' to raid far too much at the start of the tier and burn out?</div></div><hr />

I have to agree with this, no matter how face roll they make this game people still whine and cry. And to the other lazy/bad's no one is forced to do anything, people actually enjoy pushing progression and choose to use every avenue to do that while other's will sit on these forum's crying that Normal mode is too hard and that Flex takes too long to come out. <br />

If you complain about not being able to clear LFR on the first week: It's not meant for you, go normal. LFR folks will explore the Timeless Isle first.<br />

If you complain about not being able to clear Flex on the first week: It's not meant for you, go normal. As a casual guild, we target Flex and with two days raiding per week, I don't think we will learn more than one/two bosses during the first week.</div></div><hr />

Actually raiders do get preference and if you don't see that then you haven't been playing this game for very long. People like to point at ego or elitism to the other player's who like a challenge but perhaps those people should name themselves, lazy, whiny and bad.<br />

I've already heard some of the upper end raiders say they need to get into Flex as fast as possible so they can try for the trinkets. That is, and never was, Blizzard's desire for people who are heroic raiders. I think it's extreme for Flex and LFR to wait as long as they do, but I am okay with it nonetheless!<br />

My biggest issue with this is that it means we are going to have a full-on server maintenance every Tuesday for 2 months because they always shut the servers down when they bring in a new wing of LFR.</div></div><hr />

No... I'm stating that as a player on a dead realm it would be very hard for me to run normals even to do the old raids. I'm just saying why didn't blizz atleast open the first wing of LFR on release for people out there on dead realms to find something to do.</div></div><hr />

ill resub 1 week ahead of this date. then ill clear all the previous wings and then on the 23th killing garrosh.<br />
spend my gold.<br />
lol around <br />
lof off.<br />
uninstall WoW for the first and last time.<br />
<br />
People like this is dumb, if all you wanted to do was kill Garrosh in LFR and then quit, you should save yourself some money and just watch it on youtube. Whats does both really mean?<br />
<br />
Next complaint is going to be &quot;How Come we don't get new Heirloom gears in LFR too?&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hartlin</div><div class="date">2013-09-04, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GC tweeted this last week that Flex is not available for cross realm raiding but may be available later in the patch. Old raids you can but he stated specifically that Flex isn't meant to be used cross realm, at least for the present.<br />
<br />
Source? Everything I've read up until now said that you'd be able to cross-realm Flex. Curious to see a link to said tweet.</div></div><hr />

I'm stating that as a player on a dead realm it would be very hard for me to run normals even to do the old raids. I'm just saying why didn't blizz atleast open the first wing of LFR on release for people out there on dead realms to find something to do.<br />
<br />
I'm surprised no one has mentioned this yet, but there's a chance your realm may be connected to one or several others on patch day. They haven't specified which realms will be connected first. But some will be on patch day. So you might have a high-pop realm when you log in.<br />
<br />
:EDIT: Adding more to this post because, as an IT professional, the concept of connected realms intrigues me very much. I distinguish the terms &quot;realm&quot; and &quot;server&quot; as different things because they might well be different. Realms may be virtual machines on a single virtual suite on a physical server, or more likely, a cluster. This server would have to be an absolute beast, though. I can't really make any predictions because no one outside of Blizzard knows the configuration of their IT infrastructure. Oh, what I would give to spend a day with their chief IT architect. :drool:</div></div><hr />

The best thing to do is transfer. I transferred to Illidan and cleared Heroic content when I was struggling on my old crap server,AP,do it if you can.<br />

<br />
The server's aren't connected on patch day but will be sometime in the 5.4 patch which is the reason why Flex won't be cross realm when 5.4 goes live. It is all in tweet's and patch notes. Server's will be connected sometime during 5.4 but not right at release.</div></div><hr />

The new things that are being added aren't essential. People that don't manage to kill Garrosh on Flex, Normal, or Heroic and don't get their heirloom weapon will still be able to level just fine.<br />
<br />
I like this, they are trying to get more people out of lol lfr into raiding even if it is lol flex. Blizzard started all of this when they started nerfing content and wrath babies now feel entitled to get everything that everyone else has with little to no effort.</div></div><hr />

People like to point at ego or elitism to the other player's who like a challenge but perhaps those people should name themselves, lazy, whiny and bad.<br />
Lazy, whiny and bad eh? I'll give you a chance to not look like a total loser ok? I'm going to write out what my average week is like and then you can write out what your average week is like and we'll see just who is &quot;lazy, whiny and bad.&quot; Ok?<br />

I work Mon-Fri 8am-4pm with autistic and mentally retarded individuals where I have to be in multiple physical restraints on a daily basis. <br />
<br />
On Mondays, I take part in a group that advocates for a fossil free world through divestment from fossil fuel investments. <br />
On Tuesdays I run an after school bike shop for kids in my city where they can learn to build and fix their bikes. <br />
On Wednesday I jam on my acoustic guitar for the farmers market in a nearby park. <br />
On Thursdays I have practice with my band.<br />
On Fridays we go play our shows. <br />
On Saturday I volunteer at the local animal shelter and then have open bike shop for the kids until we have our weekly Saturday night ride. <br />
On Sunday I go to the Buddhist Monastery for Yoga and Meditation, then clean and do laundry and THEN do I have my largest block of time for video games. <br />
<br />
I say video games because WoW is not the only video game I play, nor is it the only video game which I chose to fully dedicate myself to. Now when I was younger and in college I had the time to join a guild and spend a few nights a week raiding and I believe you me pal, I raided. I raided when there weren't difficulty options. You were either good enough to kill the boss or get the achievement... or you weren't. Heroic mode didn't exist because it wasn't needed. The fights were already as hard as they should have been.<br />
<br />
Now that I'm older and have many more activities which I enjoy, I no longer wish to confine myself to the restraints of filling out guild applications nor the strict raiding schedules. I do however purchase each expansion and still pay my $15/month. So yes, I am entitled to see all of the content that is available, just as you are. There is nothing forcing you to run LFR if you have the means and would rather run normal/heroic. There is however, things that prevent me from dedicating copious amounts of my time to normal/heroics. And if Blizzard is going to delay the release of content through LFR and Flex then why should I bother spending my 15 dollars for a month that only contains a fraction of the actual content?<br />

<br />
I have to agree with this, LFR will be the people who are posting on here with thouands of posts that Wow is too hard yet have no time to become better players or raid in raiding guilds. People say they dont have the time but I am guessing they are benched or kicked for bad performance. Lfr is going to be real ugly when raider's have no reason to enter them, real ugly.</div></div><hr />

Wrong again. WoW existed for almost a decade without LFR. And LFR is only keeping those who don't want to play with others which is actually worse for the WoW community.<br />

Maybe you shouldn't pay all this money for a game for which you apparently have no time to play. What makes you think you should be able to achieve everything there is to achieve in a game without actually putting time into it to achieve it? Has nothing to do with being lazy, whiny or bad and all the more with realism. There is no achievement in being handed free stuff.</div></div><hr />

Also, all Stages on Mario should be open as soon as you buy the game. I want to play that 5th stage on the 7th world. wtf is Nintendo doing by making it unavailable if I paid for game already?

That's funny you mention that without LFR we wouldn't have a WoW to play. How exactly do you explain the first 6 years of this game then? Looks like we were just fine and we still would be.Do you know why they implemented LFR? Because the majority of the players weren't experience all of the story and the subs were falling. Every thing they've implemented is in efforts to retain subs. How you don't understand this is beyond me. Perhaps you should educate yourself rather than spends so much time obsessing about your status on a digital world. You might actually accomplish something meaningful.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking at your armory, my alts are better geared and have more progression than you even when you were 'a raider' lol. Go back to building bikes with your homeless kids or w/e no one cares,no one. LFR Hero now trying to feel like he has something to live for, sadly you don't.That's funny since you don't even know when I was a raider... You keep falling back on your guessing games but it only makes you look more pathetic. Stay classy buddy, maybe someday your WoW achievements will actually mean something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrong again. WoW existed for almost a decade without LFR. And LFR is only keeping those who don't want to play with others which is actually worse for the WoW community.The second post was an error, which is sad that you and the two others jump on that as way to gain a one up. Like I stated above LFR is what's keeping this game from sinking as fast as it would. I already said why I don't have the time to dedicate to WoW, if you can't figure that out, then you might be neglecting things you shouldn't.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unholyness</div><div class="date">2013-09-04, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would hardly call normal/flex raiders the &quot;hardcore&quot; crowd.<br />
<br />
The sad reality is that people think Normal mode is 'hardcore' which shows just how far player's playing level has fallen. Normal mode is for the average player and is easy but no content is easy if you play incorrectly, standing in fire,bad dps/hps,no gems/chants, and have no rotation, then i guess normal would seem hardcore.<br />
<br />
Player's used to become better player's or class leader's would help people become better player's but now it seems people go for a easier difficulty or come on here posting thousands of times saying they dont have time to raid, how ironic is that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are, clearly. At least in the context of WoW. Let's examine the evidence:<br />
<br />
Lazy: You can only devote some time Sunday afternoon to the game, in your own words, yet expect-nay, demand access to everything as soon as possible. That last part is the key: You CAN see everything, but you are (assuming you are an LFR player) unwilling to wait until October to do so, no you MUST see it the same rate as everyone else despite only being able to devote time seemingly one day a week.<br />
<br />
Whiny: You are complaining about how you &quot;have many more activities which [you] enjoy&quot;, how unfair it is to me made to wait, and how you are &quot;entitled to see all of the content that is available&quot; but again, you CAN see the content you just seem unwilling to wait. As an analogy, if you were in line at a theme park you seem to be demanding that you get access to it the same time as the VIP people do, because you paid for a ticket.<br />
<br />
Bad: &quot;No longer wish to confine [yourself] to the restraints of filling out guild applications&quot;. Claims that &quot;back in the day&quot; you raided hardcore, but now you can't. <br />
<br />
So in conclusion, the accused is lazy due to demanding equal access without the same time investment, whiny because they demand access at the same rate as those who are more invested due to paying the same amount, and bad due to not being able to put in the same effort anymore but expecting the same results.</div></div><hr />

I'll give you a chance to not look like a total loser ok? I'm going to write out what my average week is like and then you can write out what your average week is like and we'll see just who is &quot;lazy, whiny and bad.&quot; Ok?<br />
<br />
I work Mon-Fri 8am-4pm with autistic and mentally retarded individuals where I have to be in multiple physical restraints on a daily basis. <br />
<br />
On Mondays, I take part in a group that advocates for a fossil free world through divestment from fossil fuel investments. <br />
On Tuesdays I run an after school bike shop for kids in my city where they can learn to build and fix their bikes. <br />
On Wednesday I jam on my acoustic guitar for the farmers market in a nearby park. <br />
On Thursdays I have practice with my band.<br />
On Fridays we go play our shows. <br />
On Saturday I volunteer at the local animal shelter and then have open bike shop for the kids until we have our weekly Saturday night ride. <br />
On Sunday I go to the Buddhist Monastery for Yoga and Meditation, then clean and do laundry and THEN do I have my largest block of time for video games. <br />
<br />
I say video games because WoW is not the only video game I play, nor is it the only video game which I chose to fully dedicate myself to. Now when I was younger and in college I had the time to join a guild and spend a few nights a week raiding and I believe you me pal, I raided. I raided when there weren't difficulty options. You were either good enough to kill the boss or get the achievement... or you weren't. Heroic mode didn't exist because it wasn't needed. The fights were already as hard as they should have been.<br />
<br />
Now that I'm older and have many more activities which I enjoy, I no longer wish to confine myself to the restraints of filling out guild applications nor the strict raiding schedules. I do however purchase each expansion and still pay my $15/month. So yes, I am entitled to see all of the content that is available, just as you are. There is nothing forcing you to run LFR if you have the means and would rather run normal/heroic. There is however, things that prevent me from dedicating copious amounts of my time to normal/heroics. And if Blizzard is going to delay the release of content through LFR and Flex then why should I bother spending my 15 dollars for a month that only contains a fraction of the actual content?<br />
<br />
So who's lazy, whiny and bad again?<br />
<br />
First, I respect you for all the good things you do with your time. Not that you necessarily care about gaining the respect of 1 person on the internet. But it is what it is. As far as WoW is concerned, though, you're choosing to spend time on other things that aren't WoW, which there's nothing wrong with. But, understand that those who choose to dedicate more time with WoW than other things, are going to get more out of the game because of more time and effort invested.</div></div><hr />

However it's a completely rediculous notion that people who enjoy the liberties LFR afords them effects your playstyle in anyway. You are given plenty of extras for normal and heroic raiding via achievement mounts and specially heroic only bosses on top of superior gear. So again, how am I the one acting entitled? I'm mearly asking to get what my money goes in part to fund. If you insist that I'm entitled, what does that make you? You're the ones asking for exclusive things that you do not pay for. Whether or not you put in the effort for raiding, asking for raids to be exclusive to you simply because you work harder and but do not actually pay extra for it, is even worse than being entitled.

I'm not interested in being a hippie because I sold my drums, grew up and now have real responsibility like raising children.<br />

LFR is NOT what's keeping this game going as the stats I've seen in the past actually still showed that the vast majority of players don't even run LFR thereby not representing the majority of WoW players and thereby not what is keeping WoW alive.</div></div><hr />

Actually if you read back it was refuting the idea that he stated he was a good raider which nowhere in his raiding since 2008 has he downed anything while it was current content which he implied. Look at the other's who have done the same earlier in this thread but I am suprised it took you so long to get here but where is glorious leader?I am sure he will be here soon as well.<br />

I know for a fact that most of my 'casual' friends play Wow much more than I do. Some are just bad and can't progress well even with more time spent raiding and other's do other things in the game but they all spend much more time in game than myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to plod through normal in a month or so then finish heroic over the next two like usual so idc really.<br />
<br />
But from an unbiased view, it is pretty dumb to gate it that long. You're going to have the people that only do lfr do one wing, log out and in that two weeks they may decide it's not worth paying for. Same with people planning to only flex. (Which, if you haven't been paying attention, is about 90% of subscribers.)<br />
<br />
Huge gamble on Blizzards part.<br />
<br />
Just a couple things<br />
<br />
1. Timeless island is going to have almost complete upgrades for people who only did ToT LFR ( and more than likely have all the 522 stuff). On Timeless island, players can get up to 543 gear (535 plus 8). Timeless island is built much more for LFR raiders as it is actually gear progression for them. So if you ONLY do LFR, then you will have plenty to do besides your 1 or 2 wings per week.<br />
<br />
2. Flex is cross realm and very puggable - If you are one of those LFR raiders that is sitting at ilvl 520ish.. it should be very easy to start, or join a Flex pug and kill the first few bosses, they are very easy. This is one of Blizzards main goals with Flex... they want people to constantly be dipping their toes in the next difficulty level. If you are an LFR person only, you should be looking at pugging or OpenRaiding the first few bosses of Flex when you can.<br />
<br />
3. Guilds that are doing Flex mode only will probably quickly have the first 2-3 bosses on farm. By the 4th week (when they don´t get a new wing).. is the perfect time to try to kill the first couple bosses on normal.<br />
<br />
But for your argument..I think #1 is the answer. Timeless Island is actually better loot (with burdens) then SoO LFR.<br />
<br />
I was an LFR only person in the past, but this patch my guild is going to be doing Flex. I am perfectly happy with this schedule because it allows me so many options Timeless Island for instant upgrades, a few bosses of flex with my guild, A few bosses of flex on Openraid if my guild can´t clear them, dipping our toes in normal mode in week 4-5 if we are facerolling flex.<br />
<br />
But for people who have no use for Flex and don´t to do anything but LFR.. you still have a ton of upgrades on Timeless island.</div></div><hr />

Actually raiders do get preference and if you don't see that then you haven't been playing this game for very long. People like to point at ego or elitism to the other player's who like a challenge but perhaps those people should name themselves, lazy, whiny and bad.<br />

Funny part is he prob doesnt even have the gear to play that wing and will whine and cry about it if he does resub. This schedule is good for raiders and I don't see anything wrong with it.<br />

my warlock has 511 itemlvl and we need 496, so its all good.<br />
my sub ended afted i was finished gearing in LFR and had no more use for valor.<br />

<br />
I think that WoW is the last gasp of the linear content progression endgame model for MMOs. WoWs Raids are very cool and fun to experience once or twice. However they are not fun to grind on week after week because everything is scripted and happens the same way every time. Eventually somebody will need to come up with a dynamic endgame where raids and dungeons change and vary and feel more real. <br />
<br />
The great failure of the WoW raid model is that it is too much like synchronized swimming practice. You bring a team, you put in your hours of practice and eventually you learn to dance the complex dance with perfect timing. Sure it can be rewarding in a way but at a big price in grind and boredom.<br />
<br />
What is another option. Show me a game that has endgame group content done any differently?<br />
<br />
And you are crazy wrong about new games changing anything. The exact opposite is true. You realize Rift recently added an LFD tool? If Rift and Swtor´s failure tells new game developers anything, is that it better launch with all the tools and features of WOW. Swtor and Rift are both scrambling to add player-suggested wow features. LFD was just the latest example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't about 'keeping subscribers artificially by gating the content'. This is about how guilds often 'force' their members to do everything that's available. Solution? Gate normal/heroic content? Or gate LFR/Flex? Or open everything at once with the knowledge that people will be 'forced' to raid far too much at the start of the tier and burn out?<br />
<br />
The other part of it is that Flex and LFR raiders will have a lot to do on Timeless island as the gear drops on Timeless islands will be upgrades for anyone who didn´t do a lot of normal modes in ToT. Yes, my guild will only have 3 bosses to kill in Flex mode the first week, but all of us will have a gear upgrade for every slot from timeless island.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lazy would imply that I want it now, which I don't, I'm fine with waiting until October. I just don't want it split up. Either release all the wings on Sep. 10th or wait until October.<br />
<br />
I'm not whiny about so called &quot;VIP&quot; (you're not really VIP, VIP's would actually pay more and thus actually be entitled to a faster release) I'm just stating that you folks who think, because you invest more time, you are entitled more than someone else when you're not.<br />

<br />
People who only did ToT LFR and spent their VP on SPA gear probably have an ilvl of 520ish. Timeless Island drops 535 gear that can be uprgraded to 543. Besides that, the reality is the first few bosses of Flex-SoO are pretty easy. I am sure most realms you will be able to start a pug and kill a few of them. If not, look at OpenRaid.us</div></div><hr />

GC tweeted that the server's will not be connected on patch day which makes sense since there is already a lot going on that day but that they will be joined in the very near future after 5.4 launches. This effects cross realm raiding in Flex as they seem to be connected which is what the tweet was originally about was when the servers would be joined. I don't care either way as I won't be running it but that was the reasoning behind it. It will happen in 5.4 but not on launch date.</div></div><hr />

If you are clearing flex much faster than the gating, you are probably good enough to raid normal modes for better gear.<br />
If you are the target audience of flex, then you should not even notice the gating, especially after wing 2 is open (since the first three are kinda easy)<br />
If you are a normalmode raider, you can hopefully ignore lfr completely and only have to do some flex, if you want to be super hardcore about your gear progression.<br />
If you are a heroic raider you can ignore everything but normal/heroic if you arent super unlucky about that one setpiece/trinket you really want.<br />
<br />
Lfr has to be gated by time instead of difficulty, since the target audience would burn through it in a day or two otherwise. Which would result in &quot;ey dude? where is my content?&quot; from the lfr guys and &quot;thanks for ruining my epicness&quot; from the rest.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the end every audience, will get garrosh´s head at about the same time in their respective difficulty. Would be a better world, if no one would have to do any of the other less fun versions, but I think this is the best blizzard can do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When the regular raiders stop doing LFR, LFR starts sucking with wiping on every boss (and wiping increasing as less experienced raiders come). With Flex now available all normal and better raiders have ZERO reason to go to LFR. LFR will only contain the people who HATE commitment and being social. It will turn into a wipe and flame fest like we've never seen which will scare off the remaining normal raiders who dare try to get that trinket that still hasn't dropped.<br />
<br />
Even with the recently added failbuff, 5.4 will bring so much fail that people will just quit LFR again.<br />
<br />
Good riddance!<br />
<br />
Disagree with this. Yes, if you get a tank or two with normal or heroic gear, it makes a difference. But other than that, in my experience, it was always normal raiders who were the ones who were afk, or being idiots in chat, or purposefully trying to wipe the group. They also are the ones who go on rants if there is a wipe.<br />
<br />
yeah, LFR raiders probably are not as good of players as heroic raiders.. but for the most part, they are not the ones who made LFR unbearable. Without tanks from real raids, LFR will definitely be harder.. but that is just for the tanks.. DPS and healers are about the same, and it will be nice to get rid of the AFKers.</div></div><hr />

This is kind of true, the people most likely to be trolling or insulting everyone in LFR are the normal/heroic people just there for a trinket and wanting to &quot;prove&quot; how much LFR is worthless.</div></div><hr />

Flex does have an accelerated unlock timetable, and the first wing will be available on day-one of the patch. While Flex has a lot of... flexibility, it still requires coordination of a raid leader to create a competent group. Potentially to your benefit though Flex is cross-realm, and groups can be built of multiple guilds and friends regardless of the realm they play on. Considering the increased difficulty of Flex we're not sure how successful day-one Siege of Orgrimmar Flex PUGs will be (and it is progression raiding, not just slightly harder LFR), but we're excited to see people give it a shot. That's probably an option a lot of current LFR-only raiders will find enticing, and could lead them to a regular raiding group, new friends, maybe a new guild, and even higher difficulty levels.</div></div><hr />

Obviously you never raided in Vanilla. Anyone who raided vanilla will verify that for the first three raids, there were NO mechanisms at all on bosses. Besides the potions/grind and logistic stuff.. the actual fight mechanisms from vanilla were far easier than even LFR ToT. The majority of ´hardcore´ players spent 30 hours per week preparing for the raid, and then half the actual raid auto-shooting.</div></div><hr />

Well... I will admit I may have blown all CD's on the bloods on the way to Primordeus while hitting a defense to stay alive while watching others drop like flies... ;)<br />
<br />
Even so, my memories go back to when T15 LFR was first release the success rate was only good when regular raiders were present in all roles and shared their knowledge on how to kill the boss. Now they won't even be there anymore to share their knowledge. Many LFR's since have proven that nonraiders will almost never research the bosses themselves. So with no one there to say how to kill the boss you'll no doubt see stacks well greater than 5 of the failbuff and people still unable to kill the boss.<br />

If I was running that content instead of normal/heroic I would be quite disappointed because it would boil down to there not being shit to do after 2 hours on Tuesday for a few weeks.<br />
<br />
Timeless island has upgrades for those people. If you are only doing LFR, then more than likely you actually WANT solo content that gives upgrades. For Flex people (like myself).. we have Flex, LFR and timeless islands all with a chance to give upgrades from what we have now.<br />
<br />
I actually think Blizzards schedule is pretty genius. It does exactly what they hope. Everyone will start out at ´their level´ and will also do a -1 level. For instance, Flex raiders will also do LFR, Normals will do Flex. But after about 4-5 weeks, their goal is for everyone to turn that -1 into a +1. For instance.. Flex raiders will start to do some bosses in Normal. Normal raiders will get into heroics.. and LFR people, who have now seen the fights and have gear, will be able to do cross-realm or pug Flex modes.<br />
<br />
Maybe I am just being selfish because this schedule works out perfectly for me and my guild (starting flex).. But even if I was an LFR person, I still think the timeless island upgrades, along with flex-cross realm just gives a lot of progression. Blizzard should really start promoting Openraid a lot more for those people. But even still, there are a LOT of LFR people, and the first three bosses of flex are pretty easy. There is no reason you can´t pug it.</div></div><hr />

It pretty much screws anyone that plays often but doesn't run normal/heroic<br />

If all you did was LFR in TOT.. then, timeless island has 14 gear upgrades waiting for you even if you have all the SPA stuff. The other side of this ( I am an LFR only person right now), what content am I doing now? Nothing.. LFR people will not only have LFR, they will also have the timeless island for content and progression. Right now, I have LFR and nothing.. barrens loot is downgrades for me.<br />
<br />
I guess my answer is, if you are playing 30hrs per week and only do LFR.. you have had basically 2 years of this problem. It is no different after 5.4 and in my opinion, timeless island will be far better than any non-raid content for LFR people because it has actual gear upgrades. As soon as barrens launched, it was obsolete for me ( and most non-casual LFR people).</div></div><hr />

<br />
But this is not the case. In previous tiers, a LFR raider will have been grinding LFR in order to gear up for the next tier. In 5.4, he's gearing up for ... what?<br />
<br />
That is the problem, made all the worse by LFR being cleared so quickly, and by the LFR raider (most likely) not having a guild raid team that he has commitments to.<br />
<br />
Yes, the LFR raider can get upgrades on TI. But if he's not planning to do Flex or above, what is the point of those upgrades? They aren't unlocking anything.</div></div><hr />

Forget the wowprogress, like I said, I don't care about what you have or haven't accomplished. I'd like to draw light to the fact that you assume I have a burning hatred of lfr and that I feel like it impedes on my own game experience. I never said that, nor did I ever imply it. I lead a 2/13h guild, hardly hardcore or superior. As far as my stance on lfr, I don't care, because it doesn't effect me, in any way. My 1 and only issue with it is the toxic mire that it grows in the player base, and the bad habits it teaches. But again, at the end of the day, it still doesn't effect me, because I play with my guildies, not random players.<br />
<br />
My link to Bashiok's post had nothing to do with any perceived respect you think I have for him, or any CM/Dev in general. It was to make a point that LFR is not gated because of players that run normal/heroic bitching and wanting to be &quot;special&quot;, it never has been. LFR, and now flex, are gated to simulate the time guilds spend on normal and heroic. You may want to see all of a tier's content in 1 sitting, the first day of the patch, but Blizzard is completely against that, and it won't ever be that way. They didn't design this raid, or any raid for that matter, to be seen once by someone in lfr and then have them unsub. <br />
<br />
Also take into consideration this. If you full clear lfr in 1 week, see every boss, what is there left for you to do until next patch/expansion? If lfr is all you do, the answer is nothing, and do you know how many asinine threads have been made by people saying &quot; WTF blizzard, no new content for HOW MANY MONTHS? I'm done with the raid, now what do I do? Release content faster like you promised you liars!&quot;<br />
<br />
You need to accept that the gating is there for good reason, and not some personal agenda by Blizzard to cater to the 1% heroic bleeding edge guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It really isn´t about ´getting better´. For a large portion of us ´non-raiding´ people who play and post a lot, it is more just about scheduling. I know next week that I will play 10 hours.. But I cannot tell you that from 8-11pm on wednesday and thursday I will be available to raid.<br />
<br />
that really is the issue that kids cannot understand. As an adult, if my wife makes dinner 30 minutes late, I don´t want to log in to find that I was removed from my raid guild for poor attendance. I also don´t want that feeling of disappointed people if their main tank suddenly doesn´t show up. I don´t want to get invited to someone´s house for dinner and think ´wow, can´t go, have to raid on wednesday´.. Simply put, there are MANY people who enjoy WOW as one of our biggest hobbies, but it will never be anything we want to schedule our real lives around. If you are in middle-school or high school.. yeah..not such a big deal.<br />
<br />
LFR is not about people being too bad to raid, it is about ´ok, I have an hour free, let´s clear a wing´..<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Why would LFR raiders need these upgrades?<br />
<br />
because the game is built around gear upgrades. I don´t want to throw back the curtain and show the wizard.. but Blizzard knows it and anyone with half a brain knows it. In a game like wow, that is based on gear, if you stop allowing gear upgrades to people, they unsubscribe. Blizzard learned this in 2005, yet you are still asking about it?<br />
<br />
Or in more gameplay terms. It makes killing X tomorrow easier than killing X today. The same can be said with raiders. Why would someone raid after they killed heroic Garrosh? The only thing it does is making killing stuff they already killed a little bit easier. Yet entire guilds of dozens of players will end up killing heroic Garrosh dozens of times, simply so that next week, they can kill him a little easier.<br />
<br />
Also, to more exactly answer your question. Flex is broken up into small wings. If an LFR player gets his LFR gear, and gets his Timeless island gear, it makes it easier for him to do some wings of Flex in a pug. In the first month, nobody is going to want to PUG flex with people in 505 ilvl gear. It really is one of the real genius parts to what Blizzard is doing ( That flex is in wings and has personalized loot). it makes it perfect for pugs. That player that has done LFR for 8 weeks, and has all the Timeles island gear to 543 ilvl.. will be more than able to jump in and do some wings of Flex from a /2 pug.</div></div><hr />

I don´t want to throw back the curtain and show the wizard.. but Blizzard knows it and anyone with half a brain knows it. In a game like wow, that is based on gear, if you stop allowing gear upgrades to people, they unsubscribe. Blizzard learned this in 2005, yet you are still asking about it?<br />
<br />
Yes, I understand the design intent. I am wondering why I, as a player, should think I need these upgrades. If I'm not planning to go beyond LFR, what exactly do they get me in terms of value for my time spent?</div></div><hr />

<br />
God, your reasoning is impeccable. Let's all get Blizzard to remove the gating because Ark here has $15 burning a hole in his wallet. Who cares if there are actual, sound reasons behind the gating?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BobAwesome</div><div class="date">2013-09-04, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My link to Bashiok's post had nothing to do with any perceived respect you think I have for him, or any CM/Dev in general. It was to make a point that LFR is not gated because of players that run normal/heroic bitching and wanting to be &quot;special&quot;, it never has been. LFR, and now flex, are gated to simulate the time guilds spend on normal and heroic. You may want to see all of a tier's content in 1 sitting, the first day of the patch, but Blizzard is completely against that, and it won't ever be that way. They didn't design this raid, or any raid for that matter, to be seen once by someone in lfr and then have them unsub. <br />
<br />
Also take into consideration this. If you full clear lfr in 1 week, see every boss, what is there left for you to do until next patch/expansion? If lfr is all you do, the answer is nothing, and do you know how many asinine threads have been made by people saying &quot; WTF blizzard, no new content for HOW MANY MONTHS? I'm done with the raid, now what do I do? Release content faster like you promised you liars!&quot;<br />
<br />
You need to accept that the gating is there for good reason, and not some personal agenda by Blizzard to cater to the 1% heroic bleeding edge guilds.<br />
<br />
But that's the problem. It should be up to the player to decide if they want to see all the content at once or not. If they feel like they deserve more content, then they should step up from LFR. I'd be fine with seeing all of SoO in one night. I can't speak for the rest of the playerbase, as we both know they're incredibly bitchy, but if I want more content I know exactly where to go to get it. But that's pretty much a mute point, because the real reason for gated content is for sub retention, I really don't see much debate about that. It's not the wrong thing to do either, it just sucks. Unfortunately if they focused on making the game more enjoyable, they wouldn't need to gate content to retain subs as the overall enjoyable experience would do that in itself.</div></div><hr />

For a large portion of us ´non-raiding´ people who play and post a lot, it is more just about scheduling. I know next week that I will play 10 hours.. But I cannot tell you that from 8-11pm on wednesday and thursday I will be available to raid.<br />
<br />
that really is the issue that kids cannot understand. As an adult, if my wife makes dinner 30 minutes late, I don´t want to log in to find that I was removed from my raid guild for poor attendance. I also don´t want that feeling of disappointed people if their main tank suddenly doesn´t show up. I don´t want to get invited to someone´s house for dinner and think ´wow, can´t go, have to raid on wednesday´.. Simply put, there are MANY people who enjoy WOW as one of our biggest hobbies, but it will never be anything we want to schedule our real lives around. If you are in middle-school or high school.. yeah..not such a big deal.<br />
<br />
LFR is not about people being too bad to raid, it is about ´ok, I have an hour free, let´s clear a wing´..<br />
<br />
It seems to me like you're just terrible at managing your time properly. I'm married, I have two small children and I'm a full time student (with a 3.8 GPA) and I'm in a US #64 ranked guild. I still go out to the movies with my wife, hang out with friends, spend time with my children, and raid on a high end level all because I manage my time well. If your wife making dinner 30 minutes late causes you to miss raid, then find a guild with a later start time for raids (my raid group starts at 8:30pm my time and runs until 11:30pm) or make dinner yourself so it won't be late.<br />
<br />
Being a hardcore raider doesn't require a ton of time anymore, there are plenty of high end raiding guilds that raid 9-12 hours a week you just need to have the skill to be part of their team. While I will say LFR is nice for the people who really don't have the time or want to commit to raiding but it's also about skill, 90% of the players in LFR wouldn't last in high end raiding guilds but it's just due to being lazy and not applying themselves. There are plenty of resources out there for people to learn but they just want to be handed gear and carried along, LFR has been like that since it launched.</div></div><hr />

This effects cross realm raiding in Flex as they seem to be connected which is what the tweet was originally about was when the servers would be joined. I don't care either way as I won't be running it but that was the reasoning behind it. It will happen in 5.4 but not on launch date.<br />
<br />
hahaha.. yes, they said realms won´t be connected on day one.. but that has nothing to do with cross-realm Flex pugs.<br />
<br />
By your argument.. than Openraid could not exist right now. Right? By your argument ( since connected realms aren´t in game yet) it is impossible that I did a Firelands25heroic last week with people from 24 different servers?<br />
<br />
The inability right now to do cross-realm current tier raids is an artificial limitation programmed into the game. It has NOTHING to do with the actual process of connecting realms that is going to happen after 5.4 Flex raids will be cross-realm on day 1 and is not, nor will be limited to which servers you happen to get connected to.<br />
<br />

But it's not about holding on to subs. That is and always has been a tinfoil hat conspiracy that people throw around like its confirmed by blizzard in flashing lights. And no, it shouldn't be &quot;up to the player&quot; to decide what you suggest we should be able to decide. I've never seen Ra-den, does that mean Blizzard doesn't treat me like a valued player? No, it has nothing to do with that. Like I said, you may want to be able to log on once on the 10th then unsub after an hour, but that isn't what Blizzard wants, mainly because that's unhealthy for the game. If all you care about is seeing the story play out, why can't you watch a stream on twitch, or watch youtube videos? If you are of the opinion that doing lfr to see content is in any way more in-depth than watching a vid/stream, you're only kidding yourself.</div></div><hr />

Actually, be careful, you just fell into a classic forum trap.<br />

GC never said that flex raid would not be cross realm. Just a very uninformed players assumed that, and then attributed it to GC.<br />
<br />
It is funny, GC gets blamed a lot for things he never actually said, but people ´quote´him on forums and then people argue against him for something he never even said.<br />

<br />
They had tank mechanisms mostly. At the most, you had to kill adds as a dps, usually without having to move.<br />
<br />
Honestly, my opinion only, but raiding in vanilla was very very similar to LFR now. Tanks had to be on their game, dps have maybe one or two things they have to do during the boss fight. whether it be killing adds, not standing in crap etc etc. Lie Shen was harder on LFR dps than any boss up until Naxx 1.0 as far as mechanisms. In vanilla, there were fights that needed a handful of good dps to do something special, but no different than something like kiting Galaron or the egg team, or stuff like that that you need for LFR also. Every 40 man raid had a dozen guys who could afk auto-shoot on every boss.</div></div><hr />

And people like you don't understand that lfr is not keeping WoW alive, and that is NOT the reason it was implemented in 4.3.<br />
<br />
WoW flourished for over 6 years without lfr, and it would not die if it was removed. There is no reason to remove it however, and that isn't a point to argue anyway. Gating of lfr and flex is not done to extend content lifespan, like I said in an earlier post, that's utter bullshit tinfoil conspiracy that people parrot all over forums, even though its completely false. Gating is done to mimic the progression of the guilds that do normal and heroic, so that the people who run lfr EXCLUSIVELY don't burn out in a week and demand that Blizzard stop fucking them over and release new content.<br />
<br />
You also have no idea what the term &quot;casual&quot; means, because the context you're using it in, ala players that only run lfr, is wrong. I am a casual player, and I full cleared normal throne in March. 6 hours a week, 2 nights a week. Casual =/= LFR hero.</div></div><hr />

So how do you explain the first six years of this game where arguably raiding was at its peak and had even less players?

<br />
Even so, my memories go back to when T15 LFR was first release the success rate was only good when regular raiders were present in all roles and shared their knowledge on how to kill the boss. Now they won't even be there anymore to share their knowledge. Many LFR's since have proven that nonraiders will almost never research the bosses themselves. So with no one there to say how to kill the boss you'll no doubt see stacks well greater than 5 of the failbuff and people still unable to kill the boss.<br />
<br />
Trust me... the fail train is coming.<br />
<br />
So wiping 5 times on a boss makes it a fail-train? Didn´t I read somewhere that Paragon wiped 200 times on lie shen?<br />
<br />
You see, this is the real disconnect. LFR players ( myself included) don´t really hate to wipe. What we hated was the hardcore raiders going off on a rant and calling everyone bad before dropping group anyway. Aside from Galaron for two weeks, I don´t recall there ever being a feeling of ´this is hopeless´ after a wipe... You wiped, a few people commented on what happened, what went wrong.. etc etc. There is nothing wrong with wiping in LFR.. but what made LFR so terrible is the raiders who start crying, never say anything useful, just try to make themselves feel better about themselves ( ha, similar to this forum).

The insults lfr hero is bullshit, Are you really that buthurt someone gets to do a easier version of the raid than you and get lesser gear? Please tell me how in the fuck does that have any effect on your game play. <br />

And those &quot;raiders&quot; are just as bad as the people in lfr who afk, troll, or flat out can't understand or refuse to learn how to actually play their class and do more than 30k dps. When I run lfr to get some valor, I'm silent almost every time, for the entire instance. If we wipe or have a bad strat happening, I whisper the tank (if its a tanking issue) or just say in /i what should be happening to get the boss down. Are there total asshats that queue for lfr just to talk down to others and start arguments? Of course there are, but that has nothing to do with whether or not that person has heroic gear, that has to do with whether or not that person is just an asshole.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is the problem, made all the worse by LFR being cleared so quickly, and by the LFR raider (most likely) not having a guild raid team that he has commitments to.<br />
<br />
Yes, the LFR raider can get upgrades on TI. But if he's not planning to do Flex or above, what is the point of those upgrades? They aren't unlocking anything.<br />
<br />
That is the problem at the end of every expansion for every type of player, certainly was the case for DS. I think with the heirloom weapons from Garrosh, they are putting some type of carrot for everyone. but it still isn´t much. The last patch of an expansion always has a ton of players saying ´why bother´.. when they see the green drops from the next expansion.<br />
<br />
What did LFR people do after they killed deathwing in Cata? nothing. I would argue that the fact that Flex mode has wings will be a significant improvement for them. If you are fully geared in TI and LFR gear, doing a wing of Flex mode will be just as fast as doing a wing of LFR . Of course, it all seems meaningless if you are looking at green gear from the next exp. But that is true of almost everyone but the top 1%. There never is much reason to grind gear at the end of an expansion for anyone.<br />

Nothing. Once you have killed Garrosh on any level, if you are looking at it from a purely gear perspective, there is no reason to do anything else because the greens in the next exp will wipe away anything you have now. Kill Garrosh and unsubscribe.<br />
<br />
But that is simply not the mentality most of us have. Most of us enjoy the weekly, incremental gains that comes with minor gear upgrades. I like the fact that I can solo Naxx 25, but maybe in another month, i can kill LK10. I like the fact that I can kill the triceretops solo, but maybe next month I can solo the Rexes.<br />
<br />
Gear is always being made obsolete quickly in this game, grinding for gear is always pointless if you look at it closely. But then so is playing a video game in general!</div></div><hr />

What did LFR people do after they killed deathwing in Cata? nothing. I would argue that the fact that Flex mode has wings will be a significant improvement for them. If you are fully geared in TI and LFR gear, doing a wing of Flex mode will be just as fast as doing a wing of LFR . Of course, it all seems meaningless if you are looking at green gear from the next exp. But that is true of almost everyone but the top 1%. There never is much reason to grind gear at the end of an expansion for anyone.<br />
<br />
Gearing up and then ultimately starting over again in the next expansion has been what raiding entails since 2004, what are you trying to say here, Garrosh should drop weapons that are bis for the rest of WoW? I speak on my behalf and the behalf of the guildmates I raid with that the end of an expansion is not &quot;oh look greens are replacing our awesome raid epics, why did we even bother?&quot; It's &quot;Sweet, new expansion, new world, new quests, new dungeons, new raids, new everything. Lets have an awesome time together once again!&quot; I feel like there's a disconnect between people who actually raid and those who don't, but do lfr or wish that they did raid n/h. My guildmates and myself do not raid to get gear, to get ilvls. We raid to have an awesome time together, using teamwork to accomplish a goal together. Gear is a means to that end, not the end itself. Player A sees a boss die, and runs over to loot it and see if he gets to have higher ilvl. I dont raid with people like this. Player B sees the boss die, and nerdscreams go out in vent/mumble because we finally killed the bastard. Those purples he dropped will help us on the next boss in our way, not make us super leet pros who like to show off our gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem has reached an acute stage this time.<br />
<br />
First, LFR allows anyone to &quot;see the content&quot; quickly. If you want to, you'll be able to kill the end boss of the expansion on Oct 22, six weeks after the tier is released.<br />
<br />
Now, DS was like this, but in DS there was still an expectation that people would advance on to higher raid modes. But with MoP, we've had an entire expansion of people being ok with just doing LFR. Do they have any motivation to get back into the guild raiding scene? I sure don't. Heirlooms from Garrosh have zero motivating effect for me.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is just about betting the farm that lots of these people will want to advance to Flex. If they don't, the whole tail end of this expansion will collapse like a house of cards.<br />
<br />
And something else...<br />
<br />
I enter every expansion with a finite supply of give-a-damn. MoP, for some reason, has been burning it unusually rapidly. I have very little care left for what happens in the expansion. The ersatz reward scheme of pretty purple pixels with incrementally larger numbers has lost its allure. The idea of reaching my own personally defined endpoint and saying &quot;done!&quot; is looking more and more attractive.</div></div><hr />

I'm married, I have two small children and I'm a full time student (with a 3.8 GPA) and I'm in a US #64 ranked guild. I still go out to the movies with my wife, hang out with friends, spend time with my children, and raid on a high end level all because I manage my time well. If your wife making dinner 30 minutes late causes you to miss raid, then find a guild with a later start time for raids (my raid group starts at 8:30pm my time and runs until 11:30pm) or make dinner yourself so it won't be late.<br />
<br />
Being a hardcore raider doesn't require a ton of time anymore, there are plenty of high end raiding guilds that raid 9-12 hours a week you just need to have the skill to be part of their team. While I will say LFR is nice for the people who really don't have the time or want to commit to raiding but it's also about skill, 90% of the players in LFR wouldn't last in high end raiding guilds but it's just due to being lazy and not applying themselves. There are plenty of resources out there for people to learn but they just want to be handed gear and carried along, LFR has been like that since it launched.<br />
<br />
it isn´t about the amount of time, it is about SCHEDULING. I already said I play more than than 9 hours a week. It isn´t about being good, or being part of a ´team´ ( lol).. It is about scheduling your real life around a rigid schedule in a video game. For most of us.. it is just absolutely incredible that people schedule real life around a video game. that people tell friends ´sorry 8pm to 11pm is offlimits on tues wed an thurs.</div></div><hr />

I want you to visualize 25 random people queuing into normal Lady DW. Not a watered down lfr version with non-important mechanics, the actual fight. Now I want you to tell me without lying to yourself that you believe 25 people who can randomly queue up would have been able to kill DW. If you think that, you're either lying/trolling, or extremely dense. Wotlk MAY have been easier, but that doesn't mean that the people who actually DID raids back then were as daft as the random people who queue up for lfr nowadays.

25 man Lady DW was a joke considering: You got teir from running heroics and the ICC buff. Hell you could get full raid gear from running heroics now days you have to do LFR for it. In WOTLK all people cared about was your GS and achievement, You could down load a mod to fake the achievement. Hell I played on Mal'ganis than people with High gear scores and the achievement still fucking failed.<br />
<br />
But like I said before a Causal player could run heroics for Frost badges to get Full t10. These days you have to do lfr and face the RNG god, Oh and heroics are totally fucking useless now days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stretching out LFR's release just because some &quot;hardcores&quot; whined about how they felt they had to run LFR to gear up for normals, after putting massive effort to make certain LFR gear wasn't really worth hardcore raiders having in the first place, is kind of a slap in the face to the vast majority of the people who play the game and who LFR is for. &quot;Oh, you can See The Content...Over Six Weeks.&quot; <br />
<br />
And they wonder why people keep unsubbing hand over fist.<br />
<br />
And then Blizzard goes on to say that they get rises in sub numbers when patch's release. I can barely see what for, perhaps some heroic raiders returning to try and world/server first? It's not worth it for any casual to return for week 1 or 2 at all unless they plan to min max and get into the normal/heroic game late.<br />
<br />
What I find most boggling is that huge ilvl disparity between raid finder and flex SoO loot between heroic and heroic thunderforged ToT loot, and normal SoO loot. It's like they tried to make it seem not very worth it to run, though as some self entitled people have exclaimed, they would run flex AND normal mode on their mains and alts week 1 to get the op trinkets and 4sets for heroic progression week 2.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the people that the content is aimed for (normal raiders who actually kill normal at a progressed pace and heroic raiders who do the same) will have about the same length of time (4-6 lockouts) to progress to and kill garrosh. Is this a valid excuse to gate the majority of the raiding community because certain people need to feel good about their first of many garrosh kills (other than killing him on 1-3 difficulty levels higher than a flex or a raid finder raider)? No. It's not It's a slap to the face to those raiders. Hell, most of the time, I'm on the side with defending the hardcores or the normal raiders, but this is bull.</div></div><hr />

While this is all true. It is far far far to late for them to go back now. I used to be a hardcore raider. Now days I am one of the people who only does lfr. I renew my sub, clear it and then cancel it again. But like i said its to late to go back. They change being able to do that now and my sub will never be renewed.<br />

To be fair, it's not really any different than playing a sport. I used to play Hockey 3-4 times a week(2x training 2x games) and I would absolutely schedule my other real life stuff around that, now that I'm a bit older I use that time for WoW. It's not a huge commitment, but if you can play 10-12 hours a week you can definitely raid normal+, you just need to want to... Clearly you don't.

<br />
That is just stupid. There is no argument to be made for it replacing LFR other than heroic raiders feeling that both are ´beneath them´.<br />
<br />
1. LFR has no griefable mechanisms - There is no way a single player in LFR can wipe the group unless it is very very over the top. because it is anonymous, this is important. A lot of mehcanisms that a griefer could use are either toned down to nothing, or completely removed in LFR In Flex, every mechanism is intact. Because the group is built by players, there is a social awareness that prevents griefing. This is the reason the Flex feels much more like normal mode than LFR does. Some of the reason mechanisms are removed from LFR are to make it easier, but a bigger part of the reason is just anonymous griefing.<br />
<br />
2. Scheduling - Another big draw for LFR is that you can do a wing in 45 minutes, whenever you happen to log in. There is no scheduling involved. A lot of people, like myself, simply do not want to have to deal with scheduling a game. With LFR, I log in, I que, I raid, I am out.. Nobody is going to get angry if I am not online Wednesday at 8pm and I am the main tank.<br />
<br />
3. Complexity - LFR is built with strangers in mind, and without a real leader being needed. Even forming groups for lie shen is about as far as the devs can push the envelope with a complete group of strangers. With Flex mode, someone is forming the group and will be leader.. specfic assignments can be easily given. In LFR, there is nothing that can cause one player to tell another player what to do... I mean, think about it.. the longest delays in LFR are waiting for an egg team to be formed.. With a Flex group, the leader can control everything including cooldowns and groups. And because the group is formed socially, there is some force behind that leadership. In LFR... it would be almost impossible for someone to force someone else to be on the egg team.. the person doing the forcing would probably be more likely to be kicked than the one who was hesitent to do it.<br />
<br />
In the end.. it is all about the social factor. Having a group that is put together by people has a social awareness that allows for an increased difficulty that can´t be found in LFR. And conversely, automatic queues in LFR is a huge perk for people who don´t want to schedule around a game.<br />
<br />
Both give very real benefits to the game for different types of players<br />
<br />
Now quickly.. show me the differences between Flex Mode and normal mode that prevent them from being merged. LFR and Flex have very different audiences based on how they play the game. There is much closer overlap between Flex and normal.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, what? For starters, the icc player buff was not there from the beginning, just like the 20% nerf to ToT isn't active until 5.4. Also, tier from heroics? lolwhat? But that's beside the point. My point is when you consider that people who did any form of raiding in Wotlk actually had to deal with the REAL mechanics of a boss, and not an &quot;lfr&quot; version where they don't even matter, you'll understand that even those who raided 10m normals in wotlk were infinitely better than today's run of the mill lfr only player. Do you know how many people in lfr don't know that Durumu's force of will actually kills you in normal throne? TONS. Just like the people who get tracking on them and sit and attack the boss until beam phase. Guess what, that kills you to attrition in normal, and Durumu fucking nukes the entire raid on heroic if you don't finish spectrum phase in 80 seconds.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, you can't compare any raiding from the past with lfr and be taken seriously by people who raided back then and know what it was like, and know what lfr is like.</div></div><hr />

Hell, you could be turned down by gearscore alone, regardless of your defenses that you were a capable player.<br />
<br />
Obviously it was successful because the majority of raiders still run it (Against their will? Probably, but a lot of normal and heroic raiders I know refuse to que it and do just fine in the gearing game). More importantly, there is a majority of raiders who do lfr, and there is some overlap between heroic and normal raiders, that community is still the largest, despite housing certain idiots.<br />
<br />
More importantly, Lady DW was a joke. A plain, 100% bloody joke. Normal 25? You could pug that on a monday night with 40% noobs, idiots or asshats and still manage passed saurfang. ICC was not nearly as hard as anyone or everyone thinks it was, especially considering the gearing system at the time for tier pieces. Perhaps your server had more idiots than good players? Well I pity you, because that's basically all Blizzard's fault for keep transfers 25$ while having an empty server crisis that's been running rampant for 5 years.<br />
<br />
Not only are you wrong about Lady DW 25 normal, you'd probably be wrong about most heroics in icc, especially the first wing, and the first 2 bosses in plague and the first boss in frost. They were a joke for the most part. And to think, my entire ICC experience was pugging.</div></div><hr />

Both of you are not getting the point. The people who you see in today's lfr are not capable (generally) of doing anything but tunneling the boss until either they die or it does. I'm not calling DW hard, for fucks sake. I'm saying 25 random people who have never seen the fight, don't know ANYTHING about it or the mechanics, or ANY strat whatsoever, would not be able to clear it. Reading comprehension is lacking here.</div></div><hr />

When I run lfr to get some valor, I'm silent almost every time, for the entire instance. If we wipe or have a bad strat happening, I whisper the tank (if its a tanking issue) or just say in /i what should be happening to get the boss down. Are there total asshats that queue for lfr just to talk down to others and start arguments? Of course there are, but that has nothing to do with whether or not that person has heroic gear, that has to do with whether or not that person is just an asshole.<br />

Agreed, sorry if I said it wrong.<br />

90% of hardcore raiders in LFR are not assholes<br />
but 90% of the assholes in LFR are in raid gear.<br />
<br />
I do agree that LFR will be ´harder´ in 5.4 without the raiders. Definitely as far as tanks go. But I think myself, and many LFR people, do not mind ´hard´.. or wiping.. or repeated wiping nearly as much as we mind the toxic people, who are mostly raiders. Just read the forums.. nobody complains about wiping in LFR.. what you hear most is about the people who rant after wiping.. and it is like this thread.. I´ve read 2 or 3 people raiders here talking about their experiences with ´derps´ who wipe in LFR.<br />
<br />
The raiders almost counter themselves. Some say LFR is way too easy, and should give no rewards and isn´t real raiding.. others talk about the derps who wipe in it... other say that it is a ´fail train´ if we wipe 5 times (how many guilds clear a boss with less than 5 wipes?).. etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
It really is like the old George Carlin joke. Anyone who is driving faster than you is a raving lunatic, and anyone driving slower than you is a moron. <br />
<br />
I personally do not like LFR that much. But I understand exactly why it is in the game and why it is set to the difficulty it is ( mechanisms that are griefable need to be removed). I am excited for flex mode. Mainly to raid with all the mechanisms in place, but also because if I miss a week, or I am late by 30 minutes, it is not the end of the world.</div></div><hr />

For starters, the icc player buff was not there from the beginning, just like the 20% nerf to ToT isn't active until 5.4. Also, tier from heroics? lolwhat? But that's beside the point. My point is when you consider that people who did any form of raiding in Wotlk actually had to deal with the REAL mechanics of a boss, and not an &quot;lfr&quot; version where they don't even matter, you'll understand that even those who raided 10m normals in wotlk were infinitely better than today's run of the mill lfr only player. Do you know how many people in lfr don't know that Durumu's force of will actually kills you in normal throne? TONS. Just like the people who get tracking on them and sit and attack the boss until beam phase. Guess what, that kills you to attrition in normal, and Durumu fucking nukes the entire raid on heroic if you don't finish spectrum phase in 80 seconds.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, you can't compare any raiding from the past with lfr and be taken seriously by people who raided back then and know what it was like, and know what lfr is like.<br />
<br />
The sad part is, the era in which you are referencing (wotlk, specifically ICC, but I will go to example ToGC) was probably one of the easiest era's in all of WoW raiding. Normal mode was catered to the lowest skilled of most players, especially in 10 man. You could get your tier all from a badge of frost vendor for normal mode, then proceed to get tokens from 25 and 10h to upgrade to sanctified and 25h got heroic sanctified. It was a combination of catering to a casual crowd that was brought in with wotlk and a gearing system that would facilitate these casuals, but only caused everyone to be over-geared for already easy content.<br />
<br />
At that time, 2-3 weeks in icc you could pug to putress and blood queen easily on 10n and saurfang on 25n. This is common knowledge for anyone on any decently populated server at the time. If you were stuck on a low population realm? Well, A) Yeah, it's sorta blizzard's fault for keeping server xfers 25$ when they have had an empty server problem for 5 years and B) Your experience=/= the real experience. Does it take rolling on one of the highest pop realms to get the real experience? That should be a no brainer, because the highest population pve hubs always house scores of pugs, guilds and groups of people always recruiting, pugging and making ends meet. It's a shame a lot of this community misses out on that.</div></div><hr />

I speak on my behalf and the behalf of the guildmates I raid with that the end of an expansion is not &quot;oh look greens are replacing our awesome raid epics, why did we even bother?&quot; It's &quot;Sweet, new expansion, new world, new quests, new dungeons, new raids, new everything. Lets have an awesome time together once again!&quot; I feel like there's a disconnect between people who actually raid and those who don't, but do lfr or wish that they did raid n/h. My guildmates and myself do not raid to get gear, to get ilvls. We raid to have an awesome time together, using teamwork to accomplish a goal together. Gear is a means to that end, not the end itself. Player A sees a boss die, and runs over to loot it and see if he gets to have higher ilvl. I dont raid with people like this. Player B sees the boss die, and nerdscreams go out in vent/mumble because we finally killed the bastard. Those purples he dropped will help us on the next boss in our way, not make us super leet pros who like to show off our gear.<br />
<br />
I actually argued exactly your point and agree with you completely. I was trying to tell the other guy to try to block the ilvl stuff out of his head and just enjoy the next 6 months without focusing on the fact that most of our gear will be useless in 6 months..<br />
<br />
Maybe you missed the news about Garrosh´s weapons - On normal and heroic modes ( flex??) Garrosh is going to drop BOA heirloom weapons that actually scale through the next expansion. they certainly won´t be used in the first tier of next expansions raids, but even still, that is a big change from what we have seen in the past.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No point really, You must have forgot about http://www.wowhead.com/item=49426/emblem-of-frost You got 93 a week. <br />
<br />
Your T10 gear of any variety requires badges in the following quantities:<br />
<br />
Gloves - 60 Emblem of Frost<br />
Shoulders - 60 Emblem of Frost<br />
Head - 95 Emblem of Frost<br />
Chest - 95 Emblem of Frost<br />
Legs - 95 Emblem of Frost<br />
<br />
The gear can be purchased from your respective armor merchants.<br />
<br />
The T10.2 can be purchased by turning in your T10 piece and a boss trophy.<br />
<br />
For the full T10 5-piece it requires 405 Emblem of Frost.<br />
<br />
So yea You must have forgot about that LOL WHAT? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My point is when you consider that people who did any form of raiding in Wotlk actually had to deal with the REAL mechanics of a boss, and not an &quot;lfr&quot; version where they don't even matter, you'll understand that even those who raided 10m normals in wotlk were infinitely better than today's run of the mill lfr only player.<br />
<br />
IDk I seen lots of people fail at the most easiest mechanics Hegans dance, not stacking behind ice blocks, not biting other players, standing in bad shit, not stacking, not spreading out. <br />
<br />
<br />
Do you know how many people in lfr don't know that Durumu's force of will actually kills you in normal throne? TONS.

There has always been people who expect to be told how the fight is spouse to go that is nothing new, LAzy people and bads have always been in this game<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom line, you can't compare any raiding from the past with lfr and be taken seriously by people who raided back then and know what it was like, and know what lfr is like.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom line back in WOTLK people could get full tier raid gear from heriocs. Today the only way to get that is do LFR or normal mode. The game Evolved, if we did not have LFR people would be running heroics to get their Tier gear.</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying the Wrath was a hardcore player expansion mana, I didn't mean to imply that, and if I did I apologize. My only point was that lfr-ers today =/= pugging in wotlk. Surely you can see that? You didn't form a pug of 25 people, all who have never seen the fight, and go clear icc. You could carry the crap out of people, yeah, I'm not saying otherwise. Just that 25 random people who have never raided and don't know anything about it can't.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Manabomb</div><div class="date">2013-09-04, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both of you are not getting the point. The people who you see in today's lfr are not capable (generally) of doing anything but tunneling the boss until either they die or it does. I'm not calling DW hard, for fucks sake. I'm saying 25 random people who have never seen the fight, don't know ANYTHING about it or the mechanics, or ANY strat whatsoever, would not be able to clear it. Reading comprehension is lacking here.<br />
<br />
But the thing is, tools like the silly proving grounds thing and the dungeon journal are easily accessible, not to bloody mention youtube videos of other people doing it. You're forgetting my point, in the essence that a lot of wotlk was easily pugged at current content with the exception of my person experience on Ulduar (stopped raiding then, bad wow choice, good life choice). Cata tier 11 tried to change that, but we all know how that wound up.<br />
<br />
Firelands proceeded to be pugged to death in my experience as well, and I lead my own normal and heroic 10 on dragonsoul. I'd pug in 3 people and tell them the 3 mechanics they would have to lookout for on each fight. What my point is, is that you underestimate the raiders that have been forced in with idiots, trolls and the like and put them down for literally no reason other than that they cannot facilitate the time needed to put into normal modes. And punishing them because of some stupid notion of you wanting to feel better at beating content (other than beating it on 1-3 difficulty levels higher than them) is just sad.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2013-09-04, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem has reached an acute stage this time.<br />
<br />
First, LFR allows anyone to &quot;see the content&quot; quickly. If you want to, you'll be able to kill the end boss of the expansion on Oct 22, six weeks after the tier is released.<br />
<br />
Now, DS was like this, but in DS there was still an expectation that people would advance on to higher raid modes. But with MoP, we've had an entire expansion of people being ok with just doing LFR. Do they have any motivation to get back into the guild raiding scene? I sure don't. Heirlooms from Garrosh have zero motivating effect for me.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is just about betting the farm that lots of these people will want to advance to Flex. If they don't, the whole tail end of this expansion will collapse like a house of cards.<br />
<br />
And something else...<br />
<br />
I enter every expansion with a finite supply of give-a-damn. MoP, for some reason, has been burning it unusually rapidly. I have very little care left for what happens in the expansion. The ersatz reward scheme of pretty purple pixels with incrementally larger numbers has lost its allure. The idea of reaching my own personally defined endpoint and saying &quot;done!&quot; is looking more and more attractive.<br />
<br />
Ok, just to sum it up, because to be clear, you are making no sense.<br />
<br />
You say in DS, there was an expectation that people would go from LFR to real raiding.<br />
You say in SoO, despite having Flex mode, with wings, and being cross-realm, there is less expectation that people will move up?<br />
<br />
Sorry, i just don´t believe that to be the case. I believe it is MUCH more likely that people move up past LFR in SoO then they did in DS. Just the fact that it is in wings will make a huge difference for realm pugs... it will feel more like doing a world boss. Especially after the first 2 months when most people know the content.<br />
<br />
I think you have just reached a little burn-out phase yourself... and that happens.. like I said, I think all of us have had that moment where we saw the man behind the curtain and realized it isn´t worth grinding gear, especially at the end of an expansion. But then hopefully you come back and realize sometimes it is fun to just kill stuff for no reason other than wanting to kill it faster next week.</div></div><hr />

And you don't just get thrown in with 25 random retards in lfr. You can have normal mode raiders, heroic raiders queing in their offtime, people that -can- carry the crap out of the raid.

I personally do not agree with gating content at all because they gate lfr and flex now to falsely keep those people playing longer till they clear it. Normal modes and Hardmodes have a longer life span because of difficulty.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2013-09-04, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That reward is absent from LFR. I don't know any of the others in the raid, nor do I care about them. I'm sure the devs know about this problem, and are now realizing what a mistake they've made in pushing people to LFR.<br />
<br />
The devs have said repeatedly that the best enjoyment of the game is when you play with friends. Any time Flex gets mentioned they say this as the major reason for creating it. But everything is not ´best or horrible´, there is middle ground. While LFR is not the ´best´ way to raid, it is a fun, and meaningful part of many players ´end-game´. Would the devs like to get those players into Flex, certainly because they think it is more enjoyable, and they say it all the time. The other thing the devs say all the time, that I wish you would hear, is that there is this misconception that without LFR, people would do normal raids... no, they simply would not ever see the raid at all.<br />
<br />
And remember, we have now had two 14+ boss raids in a row. How many did Firelands and TOC have? The more people in LFR, the bigger raids we are getting because the devs can justify the costs. You eliminate LFR, then you are back to having 6-8 boss raids and 5 man dungeons instead.</div></div><hr />

I doubt we're going to be running SoO on the same order of magnitude as icc or ds, simply because blizzard has come out and stated many times this expac that they want to get content out faster.

<br />
The issue being your scenario would be such an astronomically low possibility I wouldn't even consider it as good data to any sort of analysis. And to be perfectly clear. There are many, -MANY- Lfr raiders who are ex normal, ex heroic that not only take the effort to spend 5 minutes at icy veins.com and learn how2class, but also know how to gear it and spec it. And yes, there are people that stack stam as BRM monks or don't use thunder focus tea (giving broad examples because I'm not listing every possible fault) and that's pretty bad on their part, however the point still remains that a situation where 25 random people (heroic raiders, normal raiders, good players running said content, idiots, players who have gear but play subpar) could still defeat a 25 normal raid boss, as they did in times previous. Would it take time to do such things, and much understanding on the parts of the players who don't know any better? Yes. Will there be hiccups, stupid wipes? Yes. Will it be the smoothest run ever? No. But people aren't as stupid as you claim them to be.</div></div><hr />

Well the funny thing is those people are probably unsubbed allready and wont resub till all wings of LFR are unlocked. In fact if I do recall correctly the reason why they said they gated LFR was because Raiders in raiding guilds bitched, whined, cryed, pissed and moaned how they were forced to do lfr.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, two expansions in a row we waited 10 months-a year for an expansion. The promise of faster content and faster expansions and the faith I gave to blizzard on a personal level was lost when mop was delayed a year. You can probably expect them to do the same with the next expansion as they will probably wait for next June or later to finish it. 9 months of SoO reporting in. (Also notice both times they stated they were working on the expansions for years before they were actually announced)</div></div><hr />

And to be perfectly clear. There are many, -MANY- Lfr raiders who are ex normal, ex heroic that not only take the effort to spend 5 minutes at icy veins.com and learn how2class, but also know how to gear it and spec it. And yes, there are people that stack stam as BRM monks or don't use thunder focus tea (giving broad examples because I'm not listing every possible fault) and that's pretty bad on their part, however the point still remains that a situation where 25 random people (heroic raiders, normal raiders, good players running said content, idiots, players who have gear but play subpar) could still defeat a 25 normal raid boss, as they did in times previous. Would it take time to do such things, and much understanding on the parts of the players who don't know any better? Yes. Will there be hiccups, stupid wipes? Yes. Will it be the smoothest run ever? No. But people aren't as stupid as you claim them to be.<br />
<br />
Again mana, I must really be failing at communicating my point &gt;.&lt; I wasn't laying out a hypothetical scenario where it's wotlk and lfr just got implemented, and lo and behold, and of the 25 people that just got grouped, not a single one has ever raided. I was just commenting on the overall state of people in lfr. Of course there are people who are very skilled who do lfr, may have done bleeding edge progression in the past even. I was never saying anything contrary, just that the stereotypical lfr player, and we all know the kind of player I mean, would not have been doing raids back in wrath, or before 4.3 for that matter.</div></div><hr />

Please tell me what will Blizzard gain by opening all of LFR in week 1.</div></div><hr />

That's funny...http://us.battle.net/wow/en/search?q=jaylock that's you right? You should not scream about casual players and act like your a hardcore raider when you only done lfr.</div></div><hr />

Well the funny thing is those people are probably unsubbed allready and wont resub till all wings of LFR are unlocked. In fact if I do recall correctly the reason why they said they gated LFR was because Raiders in raiding guilds bitched, whined, cryed, pissed and moaned how they were forced to do lfr.<br />
<br />
But that was my original point to you, that is NOT why it's gated. It's gated to mimic standard normal/heroic progression by normal/heroic guilds. Players crying on the forums has never been why blizzard changes things in their game. That's not to say they don't take in feedback on matters, but the crowd that gets on the forums and says &quot;Hey blizzard, fuck these noobs and lfr, us REAL raiders deserve to see it first&quot; is ignored, I promise you.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2013-09-04, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be fair, it's not really any different than playing a sport. I used to play Hockey 3-4 times a week(2x training 2x games) and I would absolutely schedule my other real life stuff around that, now that I'm a bit older I use that time for WoW. It's not a huge commitment, but if you can play 10-12 hours a week you can definitely raid normal+, you just need to want to... Clearly you don't. There's nothing wrong with that, but don't try and make up excuses for it.<br />
<br />
Exactly, it is about the desire to schedule to raid. I was arguing against the guy who said that most people didn´t raid because they were ´bad´. Agree with you exactly, it is just making a commitment to say that raiding on those nights is a priority. <br />
<br />
I am going to be raiding flex when 5.4 starts ( my first real raiding since vanilla). The biggest draw for me is the flex part of it. if I am miss a week, it is not a huge issue, nor will there be guild drama, nor will I lose my spot the next week etc etc. That has always been my issue with raiding since vanilla. If you have 10 or 25 man teams, then two things are going to happen. You are going to have to punish people who don´t show up, and at the same time, you are going to have to have ´extras´on standby who end up not being able to raid with you. Those two ´scheduling´ issue are what kept me out of raiding all these years. I don´t want ingame drama if something happens in my personal life, and now as a guild leader, I don´t want to have to punish people for not showing up, or to have to sit someone who does show up but doesn´t have a slot available.<br />
<br />
It should be fairly easy to keep a 15 man team going.. and if we grow to 20 and start pushing 25, easy to break into two groups without ever having to sit anyone or having any ackward moments with those hard and fast 10 man limits.</div></div><hr />

To be honest they gain nothing. As said before they said they gated LFR was because Raiders in raiding guilds bitched, whined, cryed, pissed and moaned how they were forced to do lfr.</div></div><hr />
