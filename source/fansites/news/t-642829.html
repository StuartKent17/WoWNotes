Official Patch Notes Update<br />
The official patch notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/16137368861-310-ptr-patch-notes--updated-4909.html) have been updated once again. Below are the new changes, additions to existing changes have a different color. <br />
General<br />
Due to significant talent tree revisions, all players will have their talent points reimbursed. Several new spells and abilities have been added for select classes. Players will need to visit their class trainer to learn new spells.<br />
The Argent Tournament, a permanent in-game event, has come to Icecrown. Players interested in taking part in this event should visit the Argent Pavilion located on the west side of the tournament grounds. Features include:<br />
New ways of gaining reputation with capital cities.<br />
All new daily quests, achievements and titles.<br />
New rare and epic items, tabards, pets, banners, faction shirts and mounts.<br />
Mounted combat, and much more to come!<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Lake Wintergrasp<br />
Steam Rush: Removed from the Siege Engine due to pathing issues.<br />
Mana Regeneration: The amount of mana regeneration derived from intellect and spirit has been reduced by 40%; however, talents that allow for mana regeneration while in combat have been increased. As a result, in-combat regeneration for classes with those talents will stay the same, while out-of-combat regeneration will be lower.<br />
The shaman’s Fire Elemental and Spirit Wolves, mage’s Water Elemental and Mirror Images, and druid’s Treants have all gained avoidance from area-of-effect damage similar to what warlock and hunter pets already have.<br />

Blue posts<br />
Roleplaying in World of Warcraft<br />
Role-players are not ignored contrary to what you may believe. I posted something about this a bit earlier on toward the end of the Wrath of the Lich King development cycle in which I pointed out that we have continued to add in some additional items in the game for role-playing as well as even made sure to add some additional room in the inns so that there would be additional space for gatherings (as many players had requested.)<br />
<br />
We are always open to additional suggestions and feedback (though the Suggestion forum is the best place for this.)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this is a more complex issue than just simply adding in &quot;x&quot; items. Cosmetic items are great, and they're fun, there is no doubt, but they also take away from development of other gameplay items. We do try to implement items in though whenever we can. It always comes down to trying to make the best of development time and get in all the things we want to get in. There are many facets of the game and as we see on the forums here, there are many different discussions on who gets the most attention, who is developed for most, etc.<br />
<br />
Some new things that you'll get to see as a part of the Argent Tournament are things like: Banners for the city you represent, a Squire to hold the banner for you, new shirts (Doublets) for each of the city factions.<br />
<br />
Our world events also try to include new things when possible as well, such as new pets, new clothing items, or fun trinket items.<br />
<br />
In the end though, and as much as we might try to add into the game, the RP part has to come from you and is what you make of it. If your portion of the community isn't taking part in RP like you'd like, then work on inspiring them and creating your own events. Keep in mind too that even among RPers there are different things that are considered acceptable or not acceptable. What one person may find humorous another might not. For instance, you felt the April Fools was meant in disrespect, as someone myself that enjoys RP, I found it delightful and so did many others. If it wasn't your taste, that's understandable, but with all of our April Fool's jokes, they are meant simply in fun and not as any insult to any particular group.

<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Ulduar-10 Gear - ilvl isn't everything!<br />
Fia, the difference is that ilevel is not everything. The Ulduar 10 hard gear is more optimized. It has more generous splits, better stats and better sockets. Most players would consider those pieces to be an upgrade to the 226 stuff they have on now, but it is going to depend a lot on your individual gear and what stats you need or value. If you want to be confusing, you could call it ilevel 226.5 I guess. In general, there are pieces with very high ilevels that are not upgrades to pieces with lower ilevel. We still want gear to be a choice, and not a situation where ilevel is the only thing you need to factor in. This is actually one of the reasons we are blurring ilevel a little bit and creating items that aren't always a 13 point traditional tier apart. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14637425299-25-man-raids-more-difficult-false-assumption.html))<br />
<br />
Hardcore gaming and 10-Man Hard Modes<br />
It is a valid point. However, our contention is that there are a lot more hardcore 25-player guilds than hardcore 10-player guilds so that more players interested in the 10-player version of Sarth +3 were in the former not the latter (even accounting for the size difference). In Ulduar, we are hoping to get better data about whether it’s the gear or the player interest that allows the 25-player guilds to do the 10-player hard modes.<br />
<br />
[...] We just want to make sure we are offering content players are really going to use in a way we expect them to use it. (And by “players&quot; I mean more than a handful.) As I mentioned just above, we need to determine if there is really a sizeable audience for 10-player hard modes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14637425299-25-man-raids-more-difficult-false-assumption.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking in Ulduar<br />
We don’t want to make all 4 tanks exactly the same. This is why I shy away from answering questions such as “Should I be within 2% of what another class can do?” It is rarely that simple. It comes down to whether a guild that has a paladin MT feels like it has an excessive handicap. Do good guilds feel like they need to replace their paladin MT in order to progress? I understand that the definitions of “excessive” and “good” in those last two sentences are very important, which is partially why we want to leave them vague. It’s not enough for you to tell us that your guild is going to replace you, because we have no way of knowing if your guild leader knows what they are talking about or if you are a good player or not (or ultimately if you are just exaggerating to try and make a point).<br />
<br />
To use an example, it felt to us that druids and DKs had an advantage when tanking Sartharion that was unacceptable (to us). We wanted that encounter to be experienced more as it was when a warrior or paladin tanked it (and plenty of them have). So could warriors tank that encounter? Of course. Was it too much of a burden where we felt guilds might consider replacing their tank? Probably. Does that mean every time a tank is swapped that it’s a problem with the encounter? Of course not. It could just as easily come down to a problem with the group, the players or just personal preference.<br />
<br />
Will there be Ulduar fights where some tanks are at too much of a disadvantage? We don’t think so given the PTR testing, but it could certainly happen. And when it does, we’ll respond. We are likely to respond with nerfs since we want the content to be challenging and not trivial, but it depends on the specific situation.

PvP - Battlegrounds<br />
Alterac Valley<br />
There are many updates to the battleground system in the works, but if you expect a major revamp of Alterac Valley, or for us to revert it back to its original form, you might be disappointed. Not everyone is going to be pleased with every aspect of the game, but we're not going to conduct a poll so the most vocal critics of Alterac Valley who frequent the forums can point us backward in development.<br />
<br />
You may not enjoy Alterac Valley as it is now. There may be enough people reading these forums right now to cap a thread at 500 posts expressing dissatisfaction with Alterac Valley. That's okay. We're happy with the game play of Warsong, Arathi, and Alterac Valley. We have a few small adjustments being made to Strand of the Ancients in the 3.1. After that we plan to focus on improving the overall battleground system, and release a brand new battleground as well. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16137528636-how-is-av-pvp.html))<br />

Mimiron / Hodir and DK Tanking in Ulduar<br />
We don't think Hodir or Mimiron are at that level. But again if we find that DKs (or anyone) make those fights too easy, then they will be dealt with accordingly (and probably in a way that brings many tears). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/16137215472-we-love-gc.html))<br />

Power Word: Barrier Scrapped Completely<br />
It hasn't been scrapped completely. The reply probably meant there is almost no way it is going to make it into 3.1 at this point.<br />
<br />
Working on an MMO is a little unusual because nothing is ever finished. We have this very, very long list of things we want to do which ranges from &quot;implement this new UI&quot; to &quot;try a boss fight like this&quot; to &quot;make sure warriors can tank content when overgeared.&quot; Sometimes that may look to players like we shipped something before it's ready, but from our point of view, there isn't a single thing in the game that cannot be improved, and our wish list is very long. Sometimes getting in something as big as PWB might come at the expense of 10 little things. Sometimes we just run out of time before we've come up with solutions to potential problems. We could delay patches indefinitely in order to literally get everything in, but then, you know, we would be delaying them indefinitely (and I mean by years if you look at our wish list).<br />
<br />
Things definitely get scrapped with no intention of ever seeing the light of day -- shaman tanks for instance. PWB doesn't fall in that category. Will it be in 3.2 or some future patch or expansion? We can't say with any degree of certainty. It's still a cool idea though. [...] We didn't offer PWB because it was expensive in terms of development time. The difference is we still like the idea of PWB. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137707154-power-word-barrier-scrapped-completely.html))</div></div><hr />

Can anyone explain dumb me what the hell is the point of this? I seriously don't get it at all. I don't keep a very close eyes to healers and I don't heal much myself, but as far as I know you don't stand around not using spells - most of the time you are casting something.<br />

When you cast Power Word: Shield, you increase the target's movement speed by 30/60% for 4 seconds, and you have a 50/100% chance when you cast Abolish Disease on yourself to also cleanse 1 poison effect in addition to diseases. ==&gt; Thats cool...too deep in the holy tree though:PP<br />
Also Hunter traps will no longer be able to be set off by totems. -Does that mean that freezing trap wont be absorbed by grounding?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trapping mechanism is fail, and shared CD's is double fail.<br />
<br />
Aimed with Multi<br />
Arcane with Explosive<br />
Black Arrow with Traps<br />
<br />
Your only adding abilities, and give them shared CD's instead of simplifying the class like u said you would since you openly admitted since release of WOTLK that Hunters have way to many keybinds.</div></div><hr />

(Using prices on my server, will differ from server to server)<br />
<br />
The way it worked was we would get Saronite and Eternal Earth off the AH to craft the leggings, and they either vendor them or DE and sell the large shard. Vendor value was 9g70s, shard value about 10g, cost to make was about 8g30s. So all we had to do was buy every scrap of Saronite and Earth off the AH, and sit there afk making leggings while we watch TV, earning 1000g+ a day.</div></div><hr />

I seriously don't get it at all. I don't keep a very close eyes to healers and I don't heal much myself, but as far as I know you don't stand around not using spells - most of the time you are casting something.<br />
<br />
So whats the point...? Out of combat, why do they care about making down times more of a pain? And leveling, too, at the same times. I seriously don't get it. Maybe I'm just dumb and don't see the bigger picture, can anyone enlighten me?<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, as to your levelling comment, that change is listed under &quot;PvP - Lake Wintergrasp&quot;, so I'm guessing it's just meant to be something that affects you in that zone - a PvP balancing change of some sort. Levelling shouldn't come into it really.<br />
<br />
I don't PvP myself, so that would make no difference to me, that or I'm reading it wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our world events also try to include new things when possible as well, such as new pets, new clothing items, or fun trinket items.<br />
<br />
In the end though, and as much as we might try to add into the game, the RP part has to come from you and is what you make of it.<br />
<br />
Well if they ever added extra gameplay beyond just cosmetic items, then the RP wouldn't just be cosmetic. :-X<br />
<br />
Not that I expect they will add it now, as the WoW design is too far developed, but for example: an alternate endgame to pve/pvp with its own stat, based on keeping the cities/outposts of your faction governed well, and managing those buildings, training city npcs, using convoys to send supplies, organising anti-raid defenses and setting bounties on enemy players ... etc.</div></div><hr />

We wanted that encounter to be experienced more as it was when a warrior or paladin tanked it (and plenty of them have).<br />
<br />
So why haven't they changed Sarth 3D so Sarth can be tanked by a warrior/paladin? With the Shield Wall glyph coming and the 4set bonus of Warrior tier 8 to reduce magic damage by 20% when using a 40sec cd Shield Block, I still don't think its enough to mitigate the frequent breaths at all.</div></div><hr />

if youve ever seen the film ' a knights tale' its abit like that. Youll havta wait and see i guess, but dont worry its nothing to do with ARENA as far as i can tell.</div></div><hr />

No, grounding totem absorbs the first harmful spell cast on you. Therefor it will absorb freezing as it should.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main reason for the mana reg nerf was that the encounters are too easy with healers having infinate amount of mana, and its not only a nerf to priests and druids - that goes for all healers.<br />
<br />
+ the other changes made to mana reg stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last time i checked illumination was still part of the pala talents, and its not getting nerfed so im not sure how you can put a paladin below any healing class when it comes to mana efficiency, not now and not after 3.1.<br />
<br />
Personally i dont dislike the spirit change, i dislike the removal/nerfs of valueable mana related talents from priests (or at least for disc/holy) on top of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
In patch 3.1, a new world event titled “The Argent Tournament” will be coming to Northrend! This tournament will be live on the 3.1 PTR and open for testing, though certain aspects are still in development. Players will find a host of new features here, including:<br />
<br />
* The ability to prove your worth to a capital city of your choosing through our new mounted combat system (still in development)<br />
* New daily quests to construct the great Argent Crusade coliseum for glorious battles to come<br />
* All new rewards - new items, titles, banners, tabards, pets, mounts, and more<br />
* All new achievements<br />
* Many more festivities, and more to come in future content updates! <br />
<br />
Players will find the Argent Tournament in Icecrown. Speaking to any Northrend flight master will get you on track to prove your worth to the Argent Crusade, your faction’s leaders, and all denizens of Azeroth!<br />
<br />
During patch 3.1.0, participants will work to construct the Coliseum. However the Coliseum itself will not be released until a future patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, so far we have gotten 1 warmed up raid instance from ancient times as new faboulous tuned for Level 80 chars. Which means the onyl new content so far have been 2 new onyxia's Zzz. Ulduar should have been implemented at Wotlk Release not 6 months later.<br />
Adn the additional content they bring, is not fully implementet, will be continued in a later patch (more argent crusade buldings to come), you can work on it no matter how much you work on it it will take a new patch till it is actually impelmented Coliseum).<br />
<br />
By the time Blizzard brings new content these days, how long will that take? Why release content only partially?<br />
<br />
The past day sI read a blue post &quot;3.1 may keep you busy longer than you think&quot; and I just fear that he is right. Not because it will actually keep us busy, more like it will take longer than I think for 3.2<br />
<br />
No idea where this game is going atm.</div></div><hr />
