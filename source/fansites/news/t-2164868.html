Actually the game is running at its peak right about now. It had solid influx of new players due to overwatch x-promotion. And now they will try to get wow players to atleast try it for a pretty cool mount, to get even more people.</div></div><hr />

That was my first thought. I use to be into Heroes until OW was released. Tried to play it again for the Genji skin but the game just feels so slow and blah now after so much time in OW. Meh.</div></div><hr />

I suggest new achivement. &quot;Я буду устанавливать сейчас все игры!&quot; [Install and play all these f**king games released in 21 century].<br />

<br />
Pretty much this. It's what I did for the HotS/OW promotion, but it was 30 games.<br />
<br />
To those who are curious as to fast way to do.<br />
<br />
A) Find at least one friend. Best case is getting 4, but easy AI is doable too.<br />
<br />
B) One person choose Sylvanas(already a WoW character), set to super easy vs AI.<br />
<br />
C) Push one lane that has a boss. If playing with AI, have them follow you. (just ping them) Destroy all the towers up until Nexus, then kill boss and push Nexus with boss.<br />
<br />
D) Win. Rinse repeat 15x.</div></div><hr />

No you don't. Friends are overrated. Just make a smurf account add it to your friends list and group together, then just afk for 15 games and let the AI win the game for you.</div></div><hr />

Same as League, F2P with Micros for Skins/mounts/Champs. Always at least 2 Warcraft Champs on F2P.</div></div><hr />

I don't play MOBAs so for those playing LoL/Dota 2, why is HOTS like some unwanted child? I don't know how it is for others, but HOTS is generally lacking the usual expression of personal skill other MOBAs require and show, things like last hitting (and in some MOBAs also denying), emphasizing kill streaks, itemizing your hero to be cost efficient and adapt the needs to the current state of the game, all of these are absent from HOTS. Oh, and levels are also team wide not personal.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bladehawk</div><div class="date">2017-02-06, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ferrair - you know how WoW clones usually end up failing because people say, &quot;Why would I play a slightly different but less polished/complete version of WoW when I could just play WoW?&quot; Well, same thing in the MOBA space. LoL/DotA are entrenched titans that aren't going anywhere, and HotS is a different approach that just can't gain the same traction. The Heroes Global Championship that started recently is a good step in the right direction. I'm not a big fan of MOBAs, but from what I've seen, HotS is more fun to watch because it's easier to follow, there are more teamfights, and the matches are shorter.<br />
<br />
I can stomach 15 games of a MOBA for a free (and pretty cool) mount! Thanks, Blizz.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather play neither. MOBA's are the colon cancer that the RTS genre (which was actually interesting) shat out during its death throes on the toilet after suffering a heart attack from eating too much junk food and hanging themselves from the light fitting whilst jacking off.<br />
<br />
Fuck MOBA's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game is pretty easy to get into, besides if it is anything like the Overwatch promo then you can just play games against the AI to get the 15 games, usually there will always be people looking to form groups for these types of events.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just a friend... any friend...<br />
and yes you could do it on your own but you would need to play with 2 heros of the storms open at once<br />
as you need to play a match, with the friend, and you need to be a warcraft hero<br />
<br />
<br />
if you want, you can add me and if im on that day we can play and get it done easily<br />

just because you dont like 1 type of moba doesent mean you wont like another<br />

its like going &quot;i dont like mmos&quot; then saying &quot; i mean i played roblox and dident like it so wow must be shit&quot; (i have heared that before, but it was maplestory)<br />
<br />
<br />
if you dont like a genre say &quot;i would play but i dont like mobas&quot; dont immediatly assume &quot;its a moba, i dont like mobas, therefore its shit, even though ive never played it&quot;<br />

Quickest way to do it is AI zerging, you queue up with as a party of 5 and play VS AI matches. You can get each match won in under 10 minutes. You'll find plenty of people spamming general chat in HotS for it once it goes live.</div></div><hr />

People will play it again and some of those people will start playing it more regular. <br />
<br />
If your a wow player i suggest not playing the AI...AI is boring...grab some friends from wow and do a quick match or unranked. Just remember your enjoyment of the game really depends on how you like the hero. If you play and hate it...try another hero. <br />
<br />
Blizzard would be smart to have all heroes free during this period but...that probably be to big of a promotion.</div></div><hr />

ok how does more maps/game modes split up the community...? please explain why...? and how? cause its not like wow bgs where you can que for specific bgs, or choose not to que for specific ones, you que and get a random one, thats it, the amount of battlegrounds changes nothing<br />

and i have never seen 240s long ques unless a new char JUST came out and you are trying to play them (btw you can see estimated que times per char if you hover over them, supports will get you super fast ques)<br />

also spending 1/16 of your time in que is normal... in league you would have 30-45 min games with an about 5 min que</div></div><hr />

My normal LoL queues lasted 30s max. For Aram they are 10s-30s. Im not talking about high rank queue here.<br />
<br />
More modes means more spread playerbase. Its kinda obvious? If the game has few players, more game modes means longer queue times. Imagine of HoTS had Ranked and Normal modes. The queue times would be cut by immense amounts. But at price of fun tho :(<br />
<br />
Im talking about:<br />
5 AI game modes.<br />
Quickplay (level range can be weird sometimes. Ive seen level 5s put into team with level 40s because there aint enough people :D)<br />
Heroes brawl<br />
Team Ranked (and all its ranks)<br />
Solo Ranked (and all its ranks)<br />
<br />
240s queues were in non-prime times. Not that often but it aint anything new depending what level you are and what you wanna play.</div></div><hr />

level 5s are put in with 40s because they are qued together....<br />
<br />
<br />
and idk, again ive been playing both and i find ques in hots WAY faster then league... specially since in league people will leave if they dont get the charecter they want, and you end up having to que 3-4 times before you actually play</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not many WoW players. But during the OW promotion the HOTS subreddit was filled with &quot;Came for Skin, Stayed in the game bcoz fun&quot; posts.<br />
<br />
A few who still have not played hots will likely go to level 20 for graves.<br />
<br />
My brother is already interested in the WoW mount so I just gave him he files to copy onto his PC. Should be interesting finishing the quest with him.</div></div><hr />

you seem like a shill. you do nothing but support blizzard to no end and argue in their favor, and you seem to know details others do not. how were you so assured they will still get credit? <br />
and why does your point about the difference of a reskin and remodel matter that much? they both are based off of something that existed and take much less effort than creating a TRULY new model. You and other shills can say it is &quot;a new model&quot; but it is not. It is based off an already existing model and can be considered unexciting because it is not truly new.<br />
Either your fandom is so huge you are blinded by blizzards actions, or you are a shill. I've seen fanboys and fangirls fandom pretty high, but not to the point that they know something technical that hasn't been released like knowing the person will still get credit if their account is frozen, because I have looked at all official Blizzard announcements to date and have not seen that fact.</div></div><hr />

What do you mean by &quot;how am I so sure they will get credit&quot; idk caused ethey have done this exact event 3 times before... Overwatch. Hero's of the storm recruit a friend. And the original wow one<br />
<br />
Also no it is not a redskin or the same model. It has the same skeleton. But the model is not the same. It is a competly brand new model. And omfg. Cause I know about game design and can see why they do these things I'm immediately a white knight fanboi. Also it seems you found a new word. Shill. Only reason why you would seem intent to use it so much<br />

because you know the difference between a reskin and remodel you know game design? It does not take someone with experience in game design to realize piggybacking off of an existing model and not creating a 100% original idea because you can cut corners is lazy, or an attempt to save money. Coming from a background in business, I can see how easily a meeting will go where someone could suggest an original idea, then management consider the resources it requires in plan A. Then a plan B comes along where someone suggests using an exisiting model to create something &quot;new&quot; and because it takes less resources than plan A, the manager picks that. <br />
I don't need an intimate knowledge in game design to know management's responsibility for a publicly traded company. Their most paramount responsibility is to increase stockholder value, not to create an original or creative product.<br />
It takes intelligence to realize that, or at least an objective perspective. you seem to be lacking one of the two, i'll leave that up to others to decide which it is.</div></div><hr />

Again its not fucking piggy backing of another model. Its a brand new model. The only thing reused it the skeleton. Holy fucking shit<br />
<br />
The skeleton. Yes that is reused<br />
The model is a completely different model. Different shape. Different mesh. Different everything other then the same skeleton<br />
The skin completely different <br />
<br />
<br />
It is a remodel. As it uses a different model. But the same skeleton<br />
<br />
It is not a redskin. As it is simply not a new skin<br />
And it is not a recolour. As it is not simply a colour swap<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah of fucking course it costs less then making a mount from 100% scrap. But that doesrnt mean it isn't a remodel<br />
<br />
<br />
Its like getting a car A. Taking it apart and using just the engine. Then building a completely new car. This car is now car B but still calling it car A.... Like I mean its got the same engine. So its gotta be the same thing right &quot;Mr business man&quot;</div></div><hr />

The difference is, obviously a completely new car design costs an insane amount of money, whereas incremental changes to a model do not. A car company has to do research and development, then the costs of new parts, and a new supply chain because they can't use the same suppliers unless their suppliers change processes. You really shouldn't have used a car company as an example, because there is a reason we bailed out automotive industries in the U.S. The jobs, because of the indirect and direct industries within automatives, are so vast.<br />
<br />
For Blizzard? It is the cost of the salaries to create new models from scratch.<br />
<br />
You trying to make the distinction between a remodel and a reskin is not the same as a company saying one car is a new car even if it was based on another model. <br />
<br />
The distinction truly does not matter - the point does. <br />
<br />
To be honest, I shouldn't have said your posts show a lack of intelligence or a lack of objectivity. They show both<br />
<br />
Oh p.s. I never claimed to be a &quot;Business person.&quot; I have knowledge of business and understand it well beyond your tiny comphrehension, but I'm not a business person.</div></div><hr />

Woah buddy! You're going to annoy some real aggressive fanboys or fangirls in here. <br />
You are ruining the integrity of Blizzard's game and ruining the experience for the other people that care about the game! /s<br />
<br />
When promotions that give something that is appealing to a consumer, and the promotion stipulations are not what is appealing, this is an obvious consequence, is my point.</div></div><hr />

Still, I won't be a dead weight to the team, that's just not on in my mindset. I'll try my best, but I'm not overly good at the game and I have no intention to get better, especially for such a short term goal.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, Grab someone from chat who's looking to get the same 15 games done (hell grab 4), queue against the dumbest AI. Screw around for 3 minutes a game and be done in less than an hour. There are plenty of people out there that are doing the same thing as you, don't worry about it too much.</div></div><hr />

Literally just make a smurf account on another computer, and play AI games by yourself. Or if you don't have another computer, there are ways to do it on the same computer, just have to get 2 versions of the game running at the same time. <br />
<br />
ORRRRRRRR just play AI games with people in general chat that are spamming for people to do the quest with.</div></div><hr />

But the information released says you have to play a &quot;match&quot;, which is against human players (going by what the options are in the game).<br />
<br />
So does anyone know if this will count against AI or not? I'm thinking AI games do not count, just going by what it says in the news release.</div></div><hr />

but if your really so anti social you wont add a random person to do some matches with then well... no mount : /<br />
<br />
I tried to test it out and open two windows using two launchers today, but it wouldn't let me run the game twice on one computer. I even have the option in settings checked to allow multiple launchers. But when launching the game, both launchers (two separate accounts) claimed the game was already running.<br />
<br />
Anyone else able to get it to run two sessions on one computer at the same time? Luckily I have a spare laptop.</div></div><hr />

no, sadly you cant run two versions of it at once (possibly with a virtual computer?) but yeah with a spare PC<br />
(when i said open 2 windows i ment on 2 pcs)<br />
<br />
but there will be TONS of people doing this tomorow, so if you just get in you can easily find somone, add them as friend, play your matches then remove em when your done<br />
<br />
i will bassicly be playing tomorow 1pm est to 7:30 pm EST tomorow, and will be up for playing matches with MMOchamp users, ive allready got 2 who have added me and i will help them get it done<br />

Speaking of fast XP, I tested a custom game out tonight and noticed that I can turn my damage way up, and even level my team AI up to 30. This makes it so that I can barely even ride across the map before they wreck the enemy team haha. But will tweaking these settings still count as a game for the mount? It seems sketchy as hell. The game was literally like a minute long. Maybe I'm playing in the wrong mode?</div></div><hr />

As for Hots, well I have played enough a lots of moba and Dota 1 above all, I find Hots pretty simple and easy (no item not talents but only builds) also but this is subjective I like the graphics, it is really popping on lol and Dota, not that is an obligation for a moba to have nice graphics but hey.. <br />
<br />
<br />
Also Hots has a various game mode that actually works meanwhile lol has aram or 5v5 since dominion was a flop</div></div><hr />
