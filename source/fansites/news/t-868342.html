Q: Will updated textures be applied to the Vanilla and TBC races in the future to coincide with the new Goblin and Worgen race textures? – Tank (Latin America), Welcome (North America/ANZ), Mizah (Europe [English]) <br />
A: The art team very much wants to update the older races. We feel like it’s something we owe the game and the players. We’re just looking for the right time to dive into that enormous task, without having to take too much time away from making new creatures or armor. We also have to be very careful to improve the graphics without fundamentally changing the way the models look. Players are quite attached to the look of their character, and they can be pretty sensitive to even small changes. We’re continually reminded of that fact.<br />
<br />
Q: Are there any plans to update Outland and TBC zones to facilitate better level flow? – Atreydes (Latin America)<br />
A: We think the flow of the zones works out well. It is true that you can finish the continents before hitting every zone because of the accelerated quest experience (further enhanced by mechanics such as heirlooms) but most players going back through the content on new characters seem perfectly happy to get through it faster than they did with their original character. What we don’t like is the strange way you go back in time when you go to Outland and Northrend and then back to the future (heh) when you go to the level 80-85 zones. That is definitely something we want to fix.<br />
<br />
<br />
A similar but slightly different question was asked by one of our Russian players:<br />
<br />
Q: Will the Outland and Northrend be “renewed”? Will there be new quests? - Мандрэйк (Europe [Russian])<br />
A: Because we did those areas more recently than Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor, we don’t feel the same urgency to go update them. They just don’t have the level design and quest flow problems to the same extent as the original content. We recognize though that some players are getting awfully tired of Hellfire Peninsula, and we’d like to come up with a good solution there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Mastery rating has become the most important attribute for Death Knight tanks, yet there isn’t any Rune Forge for mastery. Will you consider adding a new Rune Forge for Death Knight tanks? - Highlordkahn (Taiwan)<br />
A: We want to do another pass at the Rune Forge enchants. We think we can make some more compelling choices.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: What is your favorite escape/distraction when you arent working on WoW? – Danksz (North America/ANZ)<br />
A: We polled the entire World of Warcraft development team and included the most interesting, unusual, and potentially terrifying responses. They included: roasting my own coffee; hiking all over SoCal; gardening with yuccas and bamboo; building my own 3D printer; attempting to turn my living room into a live action scene from Tron using blacklights, stencils and a helluva lot of paint; autocross racing my sweet ride; board games (I have over 450 of them); being spinal tapped to Tumblr, Reddit and 4chan; mastering cooking (duck confit, breads, pastas, more breads); building Star Wars Lego sets; trying to control my computer using brainwaves and an EEG reader; plein air/outdoor watercolor painting; geocaching; hockey; painting miniatures; swing dancing; crafting old-time cocktails; running 5 / 10 Ks / mud runs; motorcycling; go; blending smoothies; skydiving; work on my Jaina/Varian fanfic; baking bread; playing drums; reading sci-fi; comics; playing WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will we ever see a feature like the Appearance Tab - some way to make use of all the different equipment art for items we already have without having to give up on stats in order to do so? If no, then why not? – Welcome (North America/ANZ), Ферундал (Europe [Russian])<br />
A: Having more ways to customize the appearance of their character is something players often ask for and something we’d love to improve. Seriously. We hear you loud and clear on this one. We do have some ideas we’re discussing, but we’re not ready to share them quite yet. Our concerns have always included making sure that the character art still maintains a level of quality even if extensively customized, and making sure that character silhouettes are easily recognizable. Those aren’t show-stopping concerns that would prevent us from ever taking the plunge, but they are concerns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Are there any plans to bring new items to Archaeology with each future patch? - Idej (North America/ANZ)<br />
A: We may not make it every patch, but we designed Archaeology specifically with this kind of expandability in mind. Our most immediate plans are to add rare items to the Vrykul and especially Troll races, since they have so few, and add more to Fossils in general since you end up with so many Fossil sites. We also have some plans to make it slightly easier to focus on races upon which you want to focus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will the devs consider giving us reason to interact in the new world of cataclysm? We sit in cities waiting on queues. Theres little reason to leave the city gates outside of farming and archeology. The *main* cities feel alive, the world however feels quite dead. - Odiem (North America/ANZ)<br />
A: While you’re leveling up your character and gathering professions, you’re more than likely interacting with the world plenty. World of Warcraft’s endgame has centered on dungeons, raids, Battlegrounds and Arenas for some time, so it’s natural that you spend more time in cities organizing and preparing for those group-based events. We do think there is more that we can do to promote compelling solo gameplay for max level characters, though. The 4.2 patch has a pretty epic questing experience involving the Firelands and we’re really excited to see how players respond to it.<br />
<br />
A similar but slightly different question was asked by one of our Korean players.<br />
<br />
Q: PvP realms are getting indistinctive from the PvE realm as players are not engaging into PvP contents, since they are not finding it attractive. The only difference from the PvE realm is that it’s possible to attack opponent around zones in Conflict. Is there any plan to strengthen the difference between PvP and PvE realms? – Soulcube (Korea)<br />
A: We don’t think it’s that world PvP is unattractive, we just think it’s just the cumulative effect of a lot of changes we made to the game to meet other goals. For example, flying mounts are really cool and convenient, but they mean you are much less likely to stumble upon someone from the opposite faction while travelling. We considered teleportation a mandatory feature for Dungeon Finder to succeed, but then you are less likely to bump into an enemy outside of a dungeon. To get world PvP back in some form, we’d have to develop something like the Isle of Quel’danas: a non-flight zone that is not a sanctuary where players congregate to finish quests or earn rewards. We’ll think about ways to do something like that again in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: I think a lot of people would like to see some more options for inventory storage are there plans for any of the following? Bank slots/Equipment manager storage/Upgrade backpack/storage for costume, cosmetic, toys/tabard storage. – Shinysparkle (North America/ANZ)<br />
A: We do have some storage solutions in the works. We’d like to convert tabards in particular to something like the current UI to manage titles. We don’t want to just keep giving players larger and larger bags in which to lose items. We’re focusing more on better ways to organize items.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Were hero classes considered a failed experiment, or are there plans for more? – Grozzil (North America/ANZ)<br />
A: No, we still like the concept a lot. The story behind the death knight character was that you were this fallen champion risen by the Lich King, who you eventually turn against (spoiler alert). It wouldn’t have made sense to start you in a forest killing gnolls and boars. You were supposed to feel like a high level character already! We also wanted to make the DK mechanics slightly more complex, so we wanted to make sure only veteran players were exposed to them. In general we want to add classes to the game very selectively because the game can probably only support so many and it’s a lot of new stuff to learn; even if you don’t play the new class yourself, you’ll group with them or fight against them. Introducing the DK was a learning experience for us, to say the least, but we aren’t afraid to try it again when the time is right.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Would you tell me your thoughts about the recent PvP balance? I’m wondering about the future plans that Devs has on PvP balance change. For example, only a few number of Hunter are found in the Arena and this has not been changed for years. - Stormnreaker (Korea)<br />
A: We are pretty happy with PvP balance overall. We think this season may be the best overall in terms of balance. There are definitely some areas where we can improve. Remember that part of our goal with Cataclysm was to encourage more players to try Rated Battlegrounds as an alternative to Arenas. Some classes that struggle in Arena, like hunters and Balance druids, perform very well in Battlegrounds. We recognize that Rated Battlegrounds haven’t yet caught on with players, especially more casual PvP players, as much as we’d like.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: While mining and herbalism both supports two other professions (jewel crafting and blacksmith for mining, inscription and alchemy for herbalism), skinning only support leather working and is less viable. Will you consider adding some small advantages for skinning, for example, chances to get more cooking material, to make skinning more attractive? - 柴德洛夫 (Taiwan)<br />
A: Skinning has its own advantages though. For example, you can skin the same targets you are killing for quests or while running a dungeon, while Mining and Herbalism often require you to go out of your way to gather that resource. Sometimes you get lucky and find a field of recently-killed corpses, just waiting to be skinned.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Is the Holy Paladin mastery going to remain as is, or will it see a change in the future? – Judgesyou (North America/ANZ)<br />
A: We like the mechanic. Having a shield complements their potent single-target heals rather than competing against them. As you have probably seen by now, we did increase the duration of the absorb so that it would come into play more often. We believe the Holy mastery, as is the case with some of the other healing masteries, is not an easy thing to simulate or sometimes even determine from logs. It’s hard to put numbers on it in the same way you can assign values to haste and crit. We believe this had led some players to undervalue it. We’ll see how it feels with the longer duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Gatherable nodes inside a phase area is really disturbing, especially in Twilight Highland, where nodes often appear on mini-map and vanish upon approach. Could you fix that, or move all the nodes outside of the phasing area? – 補釘 (Taiwan)<br />
A: Yes, this is very frustrating and it happens to us all the time when we’re playing as well. Ultimately we want to fix it in a robust way so that when you see a node on the mini-map, it is something from which you can actually gather. We don’t want to have to just avoid phased areas when placing herb or mining nodes, because some phased areas are quite large and ultimately we don’t want the fact that we thought the questing experience would be enhanced by phasing to spoil the gathering experience down the road.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Considering how often changes meant to balance PVE performance for certain classes then creates imbalance in their performance in PVP, and vice verse, have the developers ever considered completely separating the two? – Azunya (North America/ANZ)<br />
A: That’s a common solution proposed by our active forum participants for whom balance may be the single most important concern when they play. You have to put yourself in the mind of a new player just trying to pick up the game though. Already there are a bewildering array of class abilities and talents, many with their own idiosyncrasies or special rules. Now you have to virtually double that if you want all of the player spells to have a PvE and a PvP tooltip. We prefer solutions like resilience and diminishing returns on crowd control that are more global rules rather than virtually every ability having a PvE vs. a PvP coefficient. We want it to feel like one game with a unified set of rules.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Daily Battlegrounds only reward 25 conquest points, which is really low (considering the fact that daily heroic dungeon rewards 70 valor points). Would you consider to adjust that, as Battlegrounds attracts PvP beginner more than Arena does. –賽君 (Taiwan)<br />
A: I think it’s fair to say that Rated Battlegrounds aren’t yet offering rewards commensurate with the logistical and time commitments that they ask. We really wanted Rated Battlegrounds to be attractive to players who loved PvP but weren’t huge fans of Arenas. We don’t think we’re quite there yet and Arenas continue to be very popular just because they take fewer players and can be completed quickly. If you love Arenas, great. But we want there to be alternatives.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Moonkins lack the “execution” phase spell or talent, is that an intended design and why? –輕體小子 (Taiwan)<br />
A: While it’s true that a lot of character classes have a special ability they can use at the 20% health mark, we didn’t set out to make sure everyone had one. Balance druids have changed a lot in the last two expansions and went from a pretty simple rotation (spam Wrath or Starfire) to a pretty complex one. We’re not sure at this time they need yet another mechanic to manage, but it’s a potential design direction to explore for the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: During the expansions released since vanilla, the specialities of the different classes were watered down more and more. By now, many classes can do almost everything and almost none is still special. Are there any steps planned to give the classes more “charisma”, so that they are more distinguished from each other and regain their special flair? – Blades (Europe [German])<br />
A: Sometimes when players say “special flair” what they really mean is “something so awesome that everyone will have to take me.” We really don’t want to go back to that model, which just isn’t tenable in a game with 10-player raids and 30 different talent trees. We have no problem spreading around buffs and utility that we consider more-or-less mandatory, such as the battle rezes and raid buffs. At the same time, we think there are enough unique abilities out there to make the various talent trees shine. Shaman have a great interrupt with Wind Shear. Warlocks can get out of danger with Demonic Portal. Discipline priests can mitigate a lot of damage with Power Word: Barrier, but Unholy death knights have their own version in Anti-Magic Zone. We struggle a lot with how much homogenization is good for the game, largely so that you can play with your friends, and how much is bad for the game, because then your character feels less special. It’s something we’ll continue to work on in an attempt to strike that perfect balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: What do the developers think of the current state of hunters? (PVP balance) – Albevil (Europe [Spanish])<br />
A: Hunters are good for very skilled players and particularly in Rated Battlegrounds. Our challenge has always been to make the class a little more forgiving to play in PvP at the medium level without making them unbeatable in the hands of a truly talented player. We think the recent changes, such as Auto Shot on the move and allowing Deterrence to prevent attacks that typically always hit, will help bridge that gap. We’re starting to discuss more whether hunters need the opportunity to do some damage in melee range instead of always focusing on escape. While the hunter is ultimately a ranged class, it is true that other casters can make the decision to keep casting while in melee range, even if they suffer consequences for doing so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Players don’t use the client-implemented Voice Chat feature because third party applications are much betters. Can I expect improvements in the voice quality and a fix in the delay issue in the future? – 밥상의달* (Korea)<br />
A: We aren’t at all happy with the quality and feature set of Voice Chat. We think we can do a lot better. While we aren’t working on it right this moment, the next time we revisit Voice Chat, we want it to be an epic improvement, the same way Dungeon Finder redefined Looking for Group.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Healers cannot get Flask of Flowing Water from Guild Cauldron, which means Guild Cauldron is useless to healers. Can I expect any improvement for this? –꼬꼬*샷* (Korea)<br />
A: We couldn’t figure out an elegant way to determine if healers wanted the Spirit flask or the Intellect flask, so we erred on the side of throughput and gave them Intellect. Healers who would prefer Spirit can just get the normal flasks. We’ll think about another way to handle this. Spirit is obviously very popular among healers, but we don’t want to have a system that pops up a window asking you which flask you want.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Could we see more dynamic events in WoW? For example something like sand storms in Uldum that would blind everyone affecting the agro of the mobs. – Dagoûu (Europe ([French])<br />
A: We would like to ultimately have the world feel more dynamic and a bit less predictable. We would want for these events to feel epic though and not just annoying. We’re going to test the waters here a little in a future patch and see what feels good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lovely gems like &quot;We think this season may be the best overall in terms of balance.&quot;, &quot;Healers who would prefer Spirit can just get the normal flasks&quot; whilst dodging every single point made with no confirmation of anything in the works, what was the point of letting people ask questions?

A: We couldn’t figure out an elegant way to determine if healers wanted the Spirit flask or the Intellect flask, so we erred on the side of throughput and gave them Intellect. Healers who would prefer Spirit can just get the normal flasks. We’ll think about another way to handle this. Spirit is obviously very popular among healers, but we don’t want to have a system that pops up a window asking you which flask you want.<br />
How about the guild cauldron places a &quot;battle&quot; and a &quot;guardian&quot; cauldron for raid members to use. The battle cauldron would produce int/agi/str flasks and the guardian cauldron would produce stam/spir. Of course making each cauldron have an appropriate number of charges based on raid size and typical role breakdown. OR have to separate recipes for Guild Battle Cauldron and Guild Guardian Cauldron that have the regular number ofcharges. That took me all of 20 seconds to come up with.</div></div><hr />

A: The art team very much wants to update the older races. We feel like it’s something we owe the game and the players. We’re just looking for the right time to dive into that enormous task, without having to take too much time away from making new creatures or armor. We also have to be very careful to improve the graphics without fundamentally changing the way the models look. Players are quite attached to the look of their character, and they can be pretty sensitive to even small changes. We’re continually reminded of that fact. <br />
THIS. All Classic Races really a cosmetic change ( Maybe not Night elves ).<br />

Also, why do Blizzard employees think players don't want any spoilers ? If anything spoilers are what provides incentive to continue playing, in my opinion at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Q: Would you tell me your thoughts about the recent PvP balance? I’m wondering about the future plans that Devs has on PvP balance change. For example, only a few number of Hunter are found in the Arena and this has not been changed for years. - Stormnreaker (Korea)<br />
A: We are pretty happy with PvP balance overall. We think this season may be the best overall in terms of balance. There are definitely some areas where we can improve. Remember that part of our goal with Cataclysm was to encourage more players to try Rated Battlegrounds as an alternative to Arenas. Some classes that struggle in Arena, like hunters and Balance druids, perform very well in Battlegrounds. We recognize that Rated Battlegrounds haven’t yet caught on with players, especially more casual PvP players, as much as we’d like.<br />

So you would rather have the current BG system where we are grouped up with random people instead of making our own teams? Where probably out of those random people some are AFKers and some just don't care enough about the BG to win? <br />

To my understanding when you ask a question and blizzard responds to them in the manner that they do.

This is another case of &quot;I like something so everyone must like it to&quot; i like pvp way more now than it was in wrath, no more 2 shot deaths. Matches go longer and take more tactics, instead of the spam heal fest it was in wrath. <br />
I agree that blood DK's are a little crazy but they aren't unbeatable, also i think the new resilience nerf will be a big help. no more stacking it till you are unbeatable forcing people to actually learn there class and be good.<br />

<br />
Pointless questions were asked, such as having an Appearance Tab for tabards and such. It's always being asked, and even Blizzard said they're very clear on it - so why does that question seem to always pop every Q&amp;A, or once every so often in the blue tracker? I DO understand that there are casuals out there who don't always read MMO-Champion, lurk the WoW forums, or participate/read every Q&amp;A, but if they're really keen on their question, is it really that hard to Google it? And why does Blizzard on their part keep answering the same questions? Separating PvP and PvE spells, the issue of gathering nodes in Twilight Highlands (and other areas that use extensive phasing), Blizzards stance on hero classes, the state of Archaeology and how often new items will be introduced to that profession, the texture updates on the classic races... I believe I've listed over HALF the questions here that have been asked and asked and pounded on the devs before. <br />
<br />
The questions they answered were incredibly simple, and not worthy of a blue post. A Boomkin not having an execution-like spell or phase? I like how that gets an answer when Boomkins are topping several fights on WorldofLogs (StateofDPS), while Elemental Shamans have NEITHER competitive DPS or an execution-like spell or phase. Death Knights not having a Runeforge based around Mastery? As if Stoneskin Gargoyle didn't exist. That's like saying there should be a Runeforge based around Haste, as if Fallen Crusader didn't exist. <br />
<br />
It's as if they skimmed through the pages and pages of questions from all regions of WoW and tried to find the most passive, insignificant questions ever. If I'm wrong and they truly answered the questions that absolutely had the highest votes in their respective threads, then I'm flabbergasted. The QQ on the WoW forums pretty much buries the non-QQ threads, yet for some reason the majority wanted to know what devs did in their spare time. Ridiculous and shameful. <br />
<br />
As the previous posters have said, very little worth reading. Terrible questions. The one or two decent questions had predictable Electronic Arts-quality answers. &quot;We may or may not be dedicating resources to solving the problem, if not, bear with us, if yes, we don't know when.&quot;</div></div><hr />

A: I think it’s fair to say that Rated Battlegrounds aren’t yet offering rewards commensurate with the logistical and time commitments that they ask. We really wanted Rated Battlegrounds to be attractive to players who loved PvP but weren’t huge fans of Arenas. We don’t think we’re quite there yet and Arenas continue to be very popular just because they take fewer players and can be completed quickly. If you love Arenas, great.

Q: Moonkins lack the “execution” phase spell or talent, is that an intended design and why? –輕體小子 (Taiwan)<br />
A: While it’s true that a lot of character classes have a special ability they can use at the 20% health mark, we didn’t set out to make sure everyone had one. Balance druids have changed a lot in the last two expansions and went from a pretty simple rotation (spam Wrath or Starfire) to a pretty complex one. We’re not sure at this time they need yet another mechanic to manage, but it’s a potential design direction to explore for the future.<br />

Don't forget Shamans (both dps specs) too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much.<br />
<br />
It is interesting, though, to see their responses to people asking about ways to bring life to the world regions of the game beyond instances and scattered, near-nonexistent world PvP. The first two questions they gave extremely non-helpful, and frankly unsatisfactory responses. &quot;Oh, but flying around on your mount and picking herbs/artifacts IS participating in a living world!&quot;, &quot;We'll put in more quests!!&quot; and &quot;Another Tol'Barad/Quel'danas zone!&quot;<br />
<br />
But then the last question asks about dynamic events. Now, that should be something applied to the game as a whole, and not just a few high-level zones. Because to be frank, while the revitalization of leveling areas was great and all, you still get a profound &quot;well now this zone is useless and there is no reason to ever return, ever, unless I happen to get an Archaeology site here which is tantamount to jack squat in regards to meaningful zone interaction&quot; feeling. That just doesn't strike me right. This is supposed to be a 'living', interactive world? Shouldn't things keep happening and building and attacking and get attacked even when you're not there? Can't we be assistance to various outposts and factions than doing a repetitive daily chore?<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm getting at is, Blizzard needs to get on this &quot;dynamic events&quot; bandwagon and run with it. They need to give people something meaningful and dramatic to do outside of waiting for dungeon and battleground queues. New MMOs are getting launched this year and in the upcoming years with these kinds of zone interactions for players. WoW's borrowed from other games before, it sure wouldn't hurt to borrow this new kind of quest/activity mechanic and do their own spin on it.</div></div><hr />

If you looked at the question thread, there were LOTS of really great questions. Blizzard just picked a lot of the easy ones/the ones that have been answered before in various capacities.<br />
<br />
It would help if people would stop asking the same questions over and over again, especially on matters that've been CLEARLY given an answer to. Especially in regards to revamping Outland. Their answers on that matter have been given and their position has not changed at all in the last year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main reason why everyone was looking forward to it was because everyone was looking forward to being able to go into a rated bg alone and get rating based on their own merit (like in vanilla) But then Blizz does a 180 and makes it a 10 man arena with objectives instead.<br />
<br />
Can anoyne ask in the next Q/A why this decision was made? I bet alot of people would be doing rated BG's right now if it wasnt for the fact that they needed a premade just to do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Therec</div><div class="date">2011-03-14, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q: During the expansions released since vanilla, the specialities of the different classes were watered down more and more. By now, many classes can do almost everything and almost none is still special. Are there any steps planned to give the classes more “charisma”, so that they are more distinguished from each other and regain their special flair? – Blades (Europe [German])<br />
<br />
A: Sometimes when players say “special flair” what they really mean is “something so awesome that everyone will have to take me.”<br />
<br />
This is what I think every time I hear someone complaining about other classes getting their mechanics. In WotLK Shamans and Druids could be the worst players in the realm and still get invited to raids b/c lust and brez trumped any skill any other class had. There is still a uniqueness to every class, but now you don't have to carry anyone just to have their special raid buff.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">A J Rimmer</div><div class="date">2011-03-14, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you would rather have the current BG system where we are grouped up with random people instead of making our own teams? Where probably out of those random people some are AFKers and some just don't care enough about the BG to win? <br />
<br />
Yeah, I'd rather stick to teams.<br />
<br />
I'd rather they gave us the choice, yes. Those players that don't care/afk will be bottom ranked. Those that do will move up through the ranks so you won't be playing with the scrubs for long. <br />

Given how the blue post basically says rated BGs have failed, I'm guessing I'm not the only one who wants to join no matter how many I have in my party.</div></div><hr />

If no, then why not? – Welcome (North America/ANZ), Ферундал (Europe [Russian])<br />
A: Having more ways to customize the appearance of their character is something players often ask for and something we’d love to improve. Seriously. We hear you loud and clear on this one. We do have some ideas we’re discussing, but we’re not ready to share them quite yet. Our concerns have always included making sure that the character art still maintains a level of quality even if extensively customized, and making sure that character silhouettes are easily recognizable. Those aren’t show-stopping concerns that would prevent us from ever taking the plunge, but they are concerns.<br />
<br />
This answer has always bothered me. It sounds to me like, &quot;we don't want you to just mix-and-match your own look... that's our job!&quot; Why is it so hard to have two gear sets: the one that displays and the one that contributes to stats? I know that if I had that option, my mage would be wearing a simple robe and staff; my Paladin would be in golden armor with a hammer... I would select gear that was appropriate to my archetype, not the clown costume I'm usually shunted into.<br />
<br />
Why is that a problem? Here's why: because it means that T1-T5 gear becomes attractive for its look, and no one really wants to bother with anything after that. That's really not the players' faults, now is it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: I think a lot of people would like to see some more options for inventory storage are there plans for any of the following? Bank slots/Equipment manager storage/Upgrade backpack/storage for costume, cosmetic, toys/tabard storage. – Shinysparkle (North America/ANZ)<br />
A: We do have some storage solutions in the works. We’d like to convert tabards in particular to something like the current UI to manage titles. We don’t want to just keep giving players larger and larger bags in which to lose items. We’re focusing more on better ways to organize items.<br />
<br />
Really want to improve storage? Make tradeskill bags about twice their current size (including Jewelcrafting!) and add a feature to auctions to auto vendor or re-list an auction when it expires. I have less than a dozen tabards. I have hundreds of slots taken up in mail and bags with expired auctions and tradejunk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Players don’t use the client-implemented Voice Chat feature because third party applications are much betters. Can I expect improvements in the voice quality and a fix in the delay issue in the future? – 밥상의달* (Korea)<br />
A: We aren’t at all happy with the quality and feature set of Voice Chat. We think we can do a lot better. While we aren’t working on it right this moment, the next time we revisit Voice Chat, we want it to be an epic improvement, the same way Dungeon Finder redefined Looking for Group.<br />
<br />
This is great to hear, but I really hope that they realize what the absolute #1 required feature of successful voice chat is: You must be able to communicate while not logged in. This is essential. If I can't join raid chat from my bank alt, it's useless and I'll have to keep using Mumble (not that I don't love Mumble).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I honestly don't think Blizzard could make dynamic type world events like these other games, like Rift for instance. The zombie invasion and elemental invasion were dynamic to a degree, and they only lasted for a limited time, in this limited time people complained about them because it got in the way of their usual routine of questing/afking in the major cities/etc. If anything Blizz would probably have to inject these dynamic events into their own expansion but not have them throughout all the zones of the game new and old, it would have to be more self contained to hopefully keep the QQ away. Sadly though even if there were dynamic events in a self contained area there would still probably be QQ about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the current Arena system you get points so easily anyway so it´s not like it would screw with that. Not to mention that they will never be able to balance PvE, Arenas and Battlegrounds. It´s kinda either or.<br />
<br />
The sad thing is, I can easily get more Conquest points within one sitting of 2's than i can get honor in an entire week of farming.<br />
<br />
The system is entirely broken, the upper tier gear is more readily availiable than the ladder-step gear intended to help you get that upper tier.<br />
<br />
<br />
They need to either break rated bg's into pugs, or make it so honor is more readily available to gear up from to make things more balanced<br />
<br />
Its boiled down to the same issue as in Bc where people doing arena had better gear entirely over people who did bg's to gear up, people shouldnt be so brutally punished for doing regular bg's by not getting any honor and not being able to gear up to be able to compete with people doing Arena's/Rated BG's<br />
<br />
I myself have been able to gear with vicious far faster than I could in my spare time grinding regular bg's, its an insult to my ability to pvp</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that 10s drop loot as good as 25s, a 10 man comp can make or break your raid. E.g I (elemental shaman) got invited to the raid to do heroic Halfus. Why? The raid otherwise has no warlocks, or mages, and getting the hunters to go BM is like pulling teeth. That means, I got to go since I have Bloodlust, a ranged interrupt on a short cooldown, can do burst AOE, and provide +10% sp buff (otherwise the raid wouldn't even have the 6%). My dps sucks, the top dps can do about 30% more than I can. Part of that is I don't do my rotation perfectly, part of that is that shamans are still kind of low on dps, and some of me not having the really expensive enchants.<br />
<br />
In short your wrong twice. First, class buffs/utility can trump good players (more so in 10s). Second, high dps does not equate to good players; there is still quite of imbalance between potential dps between the classes.</div></div><hr />

A: I think it’s fair to say that Rated Battlegrounds aren’t yet offering rewards commensurate with the logistical and time commitments that they ask. We really wanted Rated Battlegrounds to be attractive to players who loved PvP but weren’t huge fans of Arenas. We don’t think we’re quite there yet and Arenas continue to be very popular just because they take fewer players and can be completed quickly. If you love Arenas, great.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cirque</div><div class="date">2011-03-14, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty baffled that in this entire thread I only saw one post vaguely attempting to defend Blizzard; I don't think I ever saw this happen before. I'm not sure if this says something about the community or the game. I'm between hardcore and casual raiding, meaning we're at 5/13 on 10man, so for me there's still plenty to do. However, besides this, what's really different from WOTLK? Why is there suddenly so more disappointment over cata than there was over WOTLK? Was it because Cata raised your expectations to a better game, as people overall seem to agree WOTLK was a failure, and in the end got disappointed? I still only log in for raids like I did with WOTLK, since there's no other interesting content - just like there was with WOTLK. The difference being, I guess, is that WOTLK's other content got older a bit slower and that Cata's raids are actually new and interesting instead of recycled (in return we get recycled 5mans, though).<br />
<br />
The only complaints I have about Cata, considering raids are still keeping me busy on heroic 10man is the fact that dungeons became trivial so fast, that there aren't enough dungeons, and that the new PvP system is so shit that I haven't even had the will to properly try Tol Barad or the new BGs yet, and yes, I used to be an avid PvPer. This is due to the rated BG change and the shit honor you gain, giving me no incentive whatsoever to go there: facerolling arena for one hour gives me ten times more than 2 weeks of BGs. In this aspect WOTLK was clearly better, where PvP to me felt progressive and interesting and there seemed some logical progression in the gear you got. The final and last complaint I have is that the testing and balancing of raids has been completely off. As a 10man guild we have been stuck on buggy to imbalanced fights a lot. When reporting those bugs the only answer I get is &quot;we're aware and looking in a fix&quot;. Some of those more serious bug reports was 2 months ago (Magmaw's random molten tantrum, for example).</div></div><hr />

I´d rather they just kept the WotLK model for PvP. Say what you want about PvE but PvP was perfect.<br />

<br />
Because it's more of the same. Wotlk brought lots of new stuff like achievements, heroic modes for raids, lfg tool and a whole new continent.<br />
Cata gave us... reforging and archaeology. Yeeeaaah, i don't know. I did all archaeology achievements and now am bored.<br />
<br />
What kept me going through Wotlk was the enormous amount of achievements and the sense that there is still 'something to do'. I am severely disappointed by amount of new achievements Cata brought up and since I've dont almost all of them I have absolutely nothing to do except for raids. Sure, raiding is fun but it's still more of the same. Similar bosses, similar mechanics, similar everything.<br />
And what we get in a new content patch? Something that was already in the game (troll dungeons), something there is no need for (looking for guild tool) and more of the same (raid content, dailies zone). Blizzard really needs to spice up things a little because at the moment game is standing still from the design point of view.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The system is entirely broken, the upper tier gear is more readily availiable than the ladder-step gear intended to help you get that upper tier.<br />
<br />
<br />
They need to either break rated bg's into pugs, or make it so honor is more readily available to gear up from to make things more balanced<br />
<br />
Its boiled down to the same issue as in Bc where people doing arena had better gear entirely over people who did bg's to gear up, people shouldnt be so brutally punished for doing regular bg's by not getting any honor and not being able to gear up to be able to compete with people doing Arena's/Rated BG's<br />
<br />
I myself have been able to gear with vicious far faster than I could in my spare time grinding regular bg's, its an insult to my ability to pvp<br />
Yup, my fresh 85s go from crafted pvp gear to epic pvp gear with very few stops in-between.<br />
I can't see any reason why a win in WSG wouldn't give you 500 honor, 800 honor on a 3-0 score, etc.<br />
It's pretty laughable when I can get my 5 arena wins before my first BG game finishes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having more ways to customize the appearance of their character is something players often ask for and something we’d love to improve. Seriously. We hear you loud and clear on this one.<br />
<br />
Really? loud &amp; clear? let's see what you think we are asking for:<br />
<br />
<br />
Our concerns have always included making sure that the character art still maintains a level of quality even if extensively customized, and making sure that character silhouettes are easily recognizable.<br />
<br />
What. The. Hell. Is he talking about? How does using my lvl 20 armor visually change my silhouette to something non workable? Was there something Non-human about my lvl 20 armor? Did the artist screw up that armor &amp; make me look like a Draenei? The only silhouette that needs to be maintained is between races. Armor doesn't change that unless they screwed up in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;maintains a level of quality even if extensively customized&quot;? What? PEOPLE WANT TO USE ONE ARMOR'S LOOK OVER ANOTHER. Does the art turn to $#!t when you have &quot;unapproved&quot; combinations of gear? The only way any of this makes sense is if they think all but the newest armor looks awful.<br />
<br />
I'm in awe of how much this response does NOT reflect what players have been asking for. All the art players want to use is IN THE GAME. people aren't asking for the ability to add spikes &amp; flames to their gear (in fact many people think we have too many) people want to use the LOOK of any gear they can wear, with the STATS of any gear they can wear. That doesn't reflect in anything they said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I for one have been playing for five years and have not yet been angered by any of the choices/responses Blizzard has made. And I can tell you it makes playing the game less tedious. I play to play. Even if I don't get my way (sobs...Poor Enhancement/Elemental/Restoration shaman...we get the worst...well not really, but we're down there...of everything) I still enjoy the game because of one thing: I don't expect too much. And mind you I am a raider. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Therec</div><div class="date">2011-03-14, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that 10s drop loot as good as 25s, a 10 man comp can make or break your raid. E.g I (elemental shaman) got invited to the raid to do heroic Halfus. Why? The raid otherwise has no warlocks, or mages, and getting the hunters to go BM is like pulling teeth. That means, I got to go since I have Bloodlust, a ranged interrupt on a short cooldown, can do burst AOE, and provide +10% sp buff (otherwise the raid wouldn't even have the 6%). My dps sucks, the top dps can do about 30% more than I can. Part of that is I don't do my rotation perfectly, part of that is that shamans are still kind of low on dps, and some of me not having the really expensive enchants.<br />
<br />
In short your wrong twice. First, class buffs/utility can trump good players (more so in 10s). Second, high dps does not equate to good players; there is still quite of imbalance between potential dps between the classes.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I don't think I was being clear on my points, so I'll go into more detail.<br />
<br />
Of course if you have an all dk group or only shadow priests as ranged then you're going to be hindered, but you have options now. You don't need every single raid buff in 10 man to down the bosses, but you do need most of them. The point that I was making is that it isn't REQUIRED to bring a shaman for lust. You have options now. In wrath, there was no option, it was stack druids for progression for the brez, and make sure there was a shaman in the group for hero. <br />
<br />
Obviously high dps does not equal skill, but it is part of it. They also need to be able to move out of the fire, interrupt when they're supposed to, and switch targets effectively. However, if you have a person pulling 7k dps you're not going to beat a lot of the bosses in this expansion. There was plenty of times in wrath that a dps could be doing less than both tanks and the boss would still drop easily. So why would a guild bring them in wrath, b/c they had a crucial buff. <br />
<br />
Lets break down the buffs that you bring to the raid. Bloodlust: If your guild did have a mage that would be taken care of, the change in this expansion gives a 10-man guild that choice, whether to recruit a mage or a shaman if they're seeking bloodlust. Wind Shear: with the short cooldown this is still unique to shaman. However, almost all tanks (all in 4.1) have a 10 second interrupt, most melee dps also have the same interrupt, so unless there are no melee in the group the interrupts are taken care of. Burst AoE: mages once again shine on this as well, but as you said there aren't mages in the guild. Hunters, DKs, Boomkins and Warlocks also can do decent AoE. 10% SP buff: This is very nice to have, but not crucial. If you have a resto or enhance shammy the 6% is nice as well, but once again not crucial.<br />
<br />
My point originally was that you don't necessarily have to carry a poor player just because they have a crucial buff anymore. 10-man raid groups have options now, which was not so last expansion. The ones who kept complaining that their class wasn't &quot;unique&quot; anymore seemed to be the ones who were only brought for said buff, and not because they had good awareness and dps/healing/tank skill.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nefastus</div><div class="date">2011-03-14, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q: During the expansions released since vanilla, the specialities of the different classes were watered down more and more. By now, many classes can do almost everything and almost none is still special. Are there any steps planned to give the classes more “charisma”, so that they are more distinguished from each other and regain their special flair? – Blades (Europe [German])<br />
<br />
A: Sometimes when players say “special flair” what they really mean is “something so awesome that everyone will have to take me.” We really don’t want to go back to that model, which just isn’t tenable in a game with 10-player raids and 30 different talent trees. We have no problem spreading around buffs and utility that we consider more-or-less mandatory, such as the battle rezes and raid buffs. At the same time, we think there are enough unique abilities out there to make the various talent trees shine. Shaman have a great interrupt with Wind Shear. Warlocks can get out of danger with Demonic Portal. Discipline priests can mitigate a lot of damage with Power Word: Barrier, but Unholy death knights have their own version in Anti-Magic Zone. We struggle a lot with how much homogenization is good for the game, largely so that you can play with your friends, and how much is bad for the game, because then your character feels less special. It’s something we’ll continue to work on in an attempt to strike that perfect balance.<br />
<br />
I wonder why they took the question as super power skills instead of just fun and class unique spells. Examples:<br />
<br />
- eyes of the beast (hunter), allowed the hunter to control his pet for a certain ammount of time. Removed.<br />
<br />
- detect invisibility (warlock) - allowed us to see some cool things such as the ghosts at undercity and duskwood, allowed us to see invisible enemies at old instances. Removed<br />
<br />
- Detect demons (warlock) - allowed us to detect demons. Removed.<br />
<br />
There are many more but those are the ones I remember right now.<br />
<br />
Those examples are not of powerful skills, just class unique ones, mostly for fun. Why did they remove that? <br />
<br />
They are just losing their touch.:mad:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Therec</div><div class="date">2011-03-14, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q: During the expansions released since vanilla, the specialities of the different classes were watered down more and more. By now, many classes can do almost everything and almost none is still special. Are there any steps planned to give the classes more “charisma”, so that they are more distinguished from each other and regain their special flair? – Blades (Europe [German])<br />
<br />
A: Sometimes when players say “special flair” what they really mean is “something so awesome that everyone will have to take me.” We really don’t want to go back to that model, which just isn’t tenable in a game with 10-player raids and 30 different talent trees. We have no problem spreading around buffs and utility that we consider more-or-less mandatory, such as the battle rezes and raid buffs. At the same time, we think there are enough unique abilities out there to make the various talent trees shine. Shaman have a great interrupt with Wind Shear. Warlocks can get out of danger with Demonic Portal. Discipline priests can mitigate a lot of damage with Power Word: Barrier, but Unholy death knights have their own version in Anti-Magic Zone. We struggle a lot with how much homogenization is good for the game, largely so that you can play with your friends, and how much is bad for the game, because then your character feels less special. It’s something we’ll continue to work on in an attempt to strike that perfect balance.<br />
<br />
I wonder why they took the question as super power skills instead of just fun and class unique spells. Examples:<br />
<br />
- eyes of the beast (hunter), allowed the hunter to control his pet for a certain ammount of time. Removed.<br />
<br />
- detect invisibility (warlock) - allowed us to see some cool things such as the ghosts at undercity and duskwood, allowed us to see invisible enemies at old instances. Removed<br />
<br />
- Detect demons (warlock) - allowed us to detect demons. Removed.<br />
<br />
There are many more but those are the ones I remember right now.<br />
<br />
Those examples are not of powerful skills, just class unique ones, mostly for fun. Why did they remove that? <br />
<br />
They are just losing their touch.:mad:<br />
<br />
This I agree with, taking away fun unique spells is pointless. I miss controlling my pet.</div></div><hr />

The developers have completely lost touch with their customer base. These questions are an embarrassment. You could remove all their answers, type &quot;Plead the 5th&quot; in and be pretty much spot on. <br />

We really wanted Rated Battlegrounds to be attractive to players who loved PvP but weren’t huge fans of Arenas. We don’t think we’re quite there yet and Arenas continue to be very popular just because they take fewer players and can be completed quickly. If you love Arenas, great.

<br />
I can answer that for you: It is because dungeons need a tank and a healer, and as long as 90% of the WoW population can't be arsed to take on the responsibility of keeping even themselves alive (let alone the rest of the group) and rather queue for 40 minutes than roll/respec healer/tank, then 40 minute queues you will get.<br />
<br />
9/10 druids and 99/100 DKs I get grouped with are dps, most warriors too - only paladins for some reason seem to happily go tank. Clearly 40 minute queues isn't half as bad as you seem to think - otherwise more DKs, druids and warriors would queue as tank. Same goes for healers I think, although there I have less experience since I am mostly healer myself (enjoying it).<br />
<br />
TL;DR: As long as ppl afre lazy and rather have 40 minute queues than go tank/healer, they will have 40 minute queues.<br />
<br />
BTW, adding more tank/healer classes or trying to to make tanking/healing more &quot;fun&quot; is never going to improve the tank/healer/dps ratio, because what most dps fear is the responsibility of primarily tanking, and secondarily healing. Likewise, as I've seen some suggestions, to make it possible for say arms warriors to tank, or say elemental shamsn to heal - not going to work becuase people will still be scared to being the sole responsible for that job. Being dps you can hide behind the fact that there are always two more dps plus tank/healer to cover up for your mistakes - the reverse is not true for tank/healer. If tank/healer fails, you wipe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm, the guy isnt even answering the question. Normal battleground is the one for starters not Rated.<br />
And to get conquest points on rated you need gear which is gain from the lowly 25 conquest point per day from the normal random battleground daily.<br />
<br />
My main is getting to the thousand conquest points which I dont need within an hour, but my alt is struggling to get the conquest point need for the starter PvP weapon.<br />
I need to spend hours and hours with random battleground to get the daily 25 conquest point.<br />
There is no way I can get or win an arena team or rated battleground without the epic and only PvP weapon now.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't see the reasoning behind NOT wanting healers (or just make it everyone) pick which stat they want out of the cauldrons. Seems sort of silly to have one specific class and spec that has to provide their own flasks.<br />
I can see you are not the guild alchemist. Someone has to bear the cost to make those flask to get the achievement and then make those cauldrons in the first place. Cauldrons arnt free and it need 1 each flask excluding flowing water to build 1. Why should we have to add an extra flask of flowing water into the cauldron receipt, just to cater restro shaman and holy priests?<br />

Blizzard.....when you have a large community of players that act like anuses a lot of the time, newbie players would not be able to get into such a group or even get one started for long. My friend got back into WoW a lil after Cata and was just trying to get the gear needed and he is getting kicked from groups like crazy after waiting 30mins a pop. He now has lost a lot of interest in playing the game. According to him the game is fun but the players are what takes the fun out of it. Blizzard try eliminating the KICK option for a while and see what happens. I still get kicked at times for dumb reasons and no reason at all and I do 10k+ damage and know all the fights now. (I'm a hunter. People still don't know that a hunter DoT/Stings do not work on that Boss in Stonecore where the DoT is to be placed to dispel his debuff.)<br />
<br />
This will and from what I see is what goes on in Rated Battlegrounds now. No new PVPer will even find such interest if a lot of anus players are always there to block attempts at getting into it. Others just wanna play and not have to go through the extra work in finding players dedicated enough to make it worth it. So far in Cata you have only sealed the trend of having to be in a guild to do anything like Raiding. I don't see as hardly anyone pugging anymore on raids except old ones and ones that give PVP gear like BH.<br />

Have to completely agree with this. What they've done is mostly evading questions, or trying to answer them in the most uninteresting way possible.</div></div><hr />

Meeeh it coulda been cleverer. Most of the answers were just a brainless &quot;HAR HAR NOPE!&quot; But a few....were on the right track at least.</div></div><hr />

I mean, they're just blatantly trolling their fans, and basically admitting they're lazy but keep giving them your money plz. Unbelievable. This is easily the most blatant trolling of your fans I have ever seen. These answers range from generic, to just &quot;wth are they smoking&quot;. It's evident they don't care about the gamers anymore, they don't even care about the game as well, and they'll now continue to do just enough to get by... And I mean, what company wouldn't put back some effort into the game that's making you all your money, that's funding everything from the game itself, to other blizzard games in the works, to their paychecks in general. What a bunch of smug tossers.<br />

<br />
&quot;We don't have the time to make major balance or aesthetic changes&quot;<br />
&quot;We have hobbies outside of WoW&quot;<br />
and<br />
&quot;I can't hear you over my new Rift subscription! 'Hey we should steal that idea....' &quot;<br />
<br />
Just remember when RIFT takes an idea from blizz it's &quot;OMFG they are COPYING WOW&lt; HOLY#$%^ LOOK AT THAT!!!ELEVEN!!&quot;<br />
When blizz copies RIFT it's &quot;oh, awesome they are doing some cool innovation.&quot; /facepalm<br />
<br />
I think it's cool that WoW will be borrowing some of the ideas from RIFT. I just don't think they can make it work. They proved that with their &quot;elemental invasion&quot; precata event. The engine won't support it, and quite frankly neither will the community. In RIFT you have to fight to keep an area safe. If people want to turn in a quest but say a death army has taken over the town they ask on channels for help. Groups form, and you lay the smack down on some zombies. Well, to be honest there is a better than fair chance those zombies lay the smack down on you. <br />
<br />
I just don't see it happening in WoW. I mean think about it. How many people would go help if someone was asking for a raid to help take back cross roads from fire elementals?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: That’s a common solution proposed by our active forum participants for whom balance may be the single most important concern when they play. You have to put yourself in the mind of a new player just trying to pick up the game though. Already there are a bewildering array of class abilities and talents, many with their own idiosyncrasies or special rules. Now you have to virtually double that if you want all of the player spells to have a PvE and a PvP tooltip. We prefer solutions like resilience and diminishing returns on crowd control that are more global rules rather than virtually every ability having a PvE vs. a PvP coefficient. We want it to feel like one game with a unified set of rules.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah well. Here's to hoping a different development team can get it right.<br />

If they can not play the class efficiently then they shouldn't be playing it at all.<br />
<br />
I laughed out loud.</div></div><hr />
