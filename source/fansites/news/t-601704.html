<meta name="description" content="Arena Season 3 starting date 
We know when the Season 3 will start ! Well, technically, no, but we've got an estimation. 
 
Season 3 is likely to start when the Zul'Aman patch (Patch 2.3) is launched, however there is a chance that it might be delayed to some time after the release of that patch.  
 
Additionally it should be interesting for you to know that once season 3 have started, it will be possible for you to buy Season 1 gear using honor points (approximately 15k/piece).

2.2 PTR Patch<br />
The [url=http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=301970360&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#0]2.2 PTR Patch Notes (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=305511689&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#6) on the official forums have been updated.<br />
<br />
Voice Chat - The new Voice Chat feature is now available in game. Players will need to go into the options menu under Sound &amp; Voice to activate it. Volume sliders are available for the microphone, speakers, and game-audio fade (which automatically lowers the game audio when a voice communication is received), as is a &quot;push-to-talk&quot; setting. Right-clicking on a player's name now includes the option to mute or unmute that player. Muting another player blocks all voice chat from him or her; the ignore feature now blocks both voice chat and text chat from that player.<br />
Chat Channels- New Chat Channel controls and functionality are now available under the chat tab in the Social Window of the interface. The interface will now show the channels players are in or are available, depending on the area of the world they are in, along with new private channel controls.<br />
A new feature for reporting players as being AFK in battlegrounds by right clicking has been added. When enough reports are registered, a 30 second debuff will begin to count down. Once the timer is up a new debuff will appear that will prevent the player from gaining any honor while it is on. This debuff can be negated as soon as the player engages in combat.<br />
Daze: Defense skill will no longer reduce the chance players have to receive the Daze effect when attacked from behind by enemies.<br />
Non-combat pets now have the tag &quot;Companion&quot; instead of &quot;Minion&quot;.<br />
Damage and health leech effects always affect flying players even if they are immune to the rest of the spell's affects while in flight.<br />
Dueling players may not use a Lightwell that they didn't create themselves. [Damn! There goes one of Lightwell's few uses.]<br />
[Hunter] Raptors can now learn Dash.<br />
[Shaman] Earth Shield is now canceled at logout.<br />
Ankhs now stack to ten.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Something new in Dustwallow ?<br />
Best case scenario : I guess they could finish the King of Stormwind storyline or add an heroic mode to Onyxia. Worst case scenario : They're fixing murlocs here. (Even uber-best case scenario : Something related to Arthas and Jaina ?)<br />
<br />
Don't forget that we have voice chat coming, guild banks, Zul'Aman and something else after that slated for future patches. (Even some changes to Dustwallow Marsh people might be interested in.)<br />
<br />
The World (of Warcraft) doesn't stop because we announce a new expansion in the works.<br />

I don't think Blizzard's solution will completely solve the problem, but it will help. Even with player misuse you can remove the debuff by engaging in some type of combat.<br />
<br />
Where I see potential for misuse is while defending in AV, guarding a flag in AB, or guarding the flag carrier in WSG. In all of these examples it is possible for a player to be flagged as AFK by malicious teammates yet the player is playing an important role in the BG and may not have a way to engage in combat within the 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />

Your forgetting that it it said once &quot;enough&quot; complaints are registered, they would be debuffed. So unless you have decent sized group of players trying to abuse the system, its not likely to be abused.</div></div><hr />

ZA was NEVER slated for 2.2<br />
<br />
<br />
Guild Banks and Zul'Amman<br />
The new features mentioned in recent developer interviews are planned for a future patch, they will not be part of 2.2.<br />

Only if the tank turns around (which he shouldn't anyways, as it makes him more vulnerable to attack).</div></div><hr />

QQ, try being a clothie doing it, you have more than 8k health running through those mobs, and armor, you are way out of there range, even if dazed, before you come close to death (plus your higher block, parry and dodge), you already have it easier than everyone else regarding daze, even without the lowered chance.</div></div><hr />

Dear blizzard,<br />
<br />
I will gladly accept getting knocked off my mount a bit more often while prot specced and grinding in the same gear if, in return, I can grind at something even close to half the speed of warlocks and mages with my prot spec.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">winze</div><div class="date">2007-08-10, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is sad :(<br />
delaying patches for crappy voice chat...<br />
<br />
rather have Zul and they can fix the voice chat with s3 IMO</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-08-10, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting knocked off your mount isn't the problem, its getting killed by mobs while running anywere..<br />
<br />
Frost Nova and Blink have cooldowns, and you get REALLY unlucky sometimes.. (especailly with Arrakoa.. don't know why but they really hate me)<br />
<br />
Btw, you can get the grinding ability of your other specs as prot, when I can have the survivability of Ice, and the mana regen and damage boosts of Arcane, at the the same time as well.<br />
<br />
You picked a spec, deal with it, my fiance's priest is holy (level 64 to be exact) and she's HORRIBLE at grinding and questing in full damage/healing gear, but she did it for instances. She realizes she's holy, and she doesn't care that she can't grind or quest, because she knows her build has its strengths and weaknesses as do all builds.<br />
<br />
You can bring up the &quot;But dps classes have it easier&quot; argument, and I'm not going to say we don't, but when it comes to specs, Blizzard gives you the option to respec if you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole defense skill decreases chance to be dazed needed to be removed awhile ago and sounds more like a bug then an intended use of defense.<br />
<br />
Sadly warriors aren't druids, they can't get DPS and tanking in the same tree =p<br />

<br />
<br />
Nobody even knew defence skill factored into dazed chance until Vaneck told us about it about a month ago, and in that post he said it was base defence that was used, not modified. My own gut says the same, I now quest with about 100 more defence than I had a few weeks back and get dazed and dismounted just as often as I did before so I wouldn't be surprised if this is an old patch note that wasn't included before since the game seems to already work like this anyway.</div></div><hr />
