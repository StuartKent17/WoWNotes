At BlizzCon 2018, we talked about how we plan to keep loot trading in World of Warcraft Classic. We added loot trading in Wrath of the Lich King to solve a common problem: a player could accidentally loot an item meant for another player or give it to the wrong person using Master Loot. They would then have to contact Blizzard to get the item moved to the intended recipient, which might take days. We wanted to keep loot trading in WoW Classic because the end result is the same – the correct person gets the item – and it’ll save everyone time.<br />
<br />
But we heard your concerns about the potential for abuse of the loot trading system in parties of five. It’s possible that abusive play could take the form of a group of four players colluding to deny loot to a stranger who joined their party as a pick-up. Raid groups, being much larger, come with more understanding on the part of solo players that loot distribution can depend on the whims of the many players and raid leaders who know each other.<br />
<br />
Taking that into consideration, we’ve decided that the two-hour loot trading system in WoW Classic will only apply to soulbound gear that drops in raids. Soulbound loot that drops in five-person content will not be tradeable at any time. What we hope to do is to strike a balance between saving players time and minimizing the potential for abuse of the system. We think this approach better addresses the concerns we’ve heard from players on the subject.</div></div><hr />

If you're raiding -&gt; you are doign it with people you trust.<br />

If you're doing a dungeon with other 4 people from the same guild group -&gt; they'll rather give drops each other than you.</div></div><hr />

Their only concern is 5 man groups locking one player out from getting loot.<br />
<br />
In raids they think its more understandable that raid leaders choose who loot goes to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's about staying as close to Vanilla as possible. If they could do retail's loot system in Classic without there being a huge shitstorm they probably would because it would mean a lot less work for them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well at least they're listening.<br />
<br />

Will this even apply to UBRS loot? It's technically a &quot;raid&quot; but it's really just a glorified dungeon with dungeon loot.</div></div><hr />

Good point. I have absolutely no idea how they'll determine the threshold, guess we'll need to wait for more details from the Classic team.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it will apply to UBRS. It's a half of a dungeon. Raids have green portals while dungeons have blue.</div></div><hr />

They don't need an army of GMs monitoring tickets; just let the players in raids handle it while preventing dungeon run abuse.<br />
Fine by me.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of that can be a negative is gear funneling in a raid if they choose to ML + rolls.<br />
Ex: Plate gloves drop and pug War rolls a 78. Fellow guildie rolls 43, so they lose, but their friend, who doesn't need the item at all, rolls and gets an 85.<br />
The loot goes to friend, who then immediately trades to the low roller, bypassing the pug's chance at loot.<br />
<br />
Pugging won't be that common early on, but I def think it could be an issue later down the line.<br />
Maybe they will implement a silent counter of sorts? Like, you are only allowed to trade up to X number of items per week to prevent trade abuse?<br />
Meh, whatevs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh right, nice catch, that's probably the way to tell which instances fall into the system or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It addresses the abuse of the system in 5 man content while trusting the playerbase to not abuse it in raid content; but it does not prevent it.<br />
<br />
In short; it doesn't. They even outright say that solo players joining raid content should have the understanding that the group as a whole and its leaders may collectively decide to do exactly that, that it is the obligation of the solo player to have that understanding going in.<br />
<br />
The only real difference (and some would say saving grace) is that in a vanilla environment, guilds doing that regularly will eventually gain a reputation for doing so on the server, and would then presumably experience increasing difficulty filling vacant spots with pugs as that reputation grows and more solo raiders avoid joining their groups. I've probably seen about as many guilds continue on entirely unaffected by such a reputation as I've seen fall apart- It'll really depend entirely on how the community is on that server. <br />
<br />
Crushridge Alliance for example, in vanilla at least, the community was pretty heavily opposed to that kind of behavior, ninjas and those similar were ostracized into obscurity pretty regularly.<br />
<br />
I'd be curious to see if they'll also be doing the whole &quot;I have a screenshot of the RL from this raid stating the loot rules in chat and then going against said rules&quot; thing on classic servers though. Though I really don't recall that being a thing during vanilla so much as it was in wrath+.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, they literally have different standards when deciding what they want to put into classic. It's &quot;was it in classic?&quot;. Why on earth would they judge retail under that same standard?</div></div><hr />

People seem to be angry that for the 1.12 patch they are using, they will use the AV that was around in 1.12, rather than the 1.5 which people seem to really want.<br />
<br />
So sorry, but people clearly don't want a true vanilla experience anyway. 1.5 AV with 1.12 balancing is just not 100% vanilla, and people are fine with it around here.</div></div><hr />

In theory that's true, however even in vanilla there were certain realms full of douchebags where such behaviour was normal. On other realms there were usually 1-2 guilds that behaved like that as well, usually realm first guilds.<br />
<br />
Community is a relative term. It will be better than in retail, but not sunshine and rainbows. Douchebags will be douchebags regardless of community and reputation. Any change that helps prevent douche behaviour is welcome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually in TBC and earlier every raider at some point or another will have seen this mistake. Large raid groups, lots of loot to dish out, ML is trying to rush it so they can keep going. In their haste they click a wrong name when dishing out the loot. Even the most careful RL / ML have done it<br />
<br />
To me I think loot trading would be a bigger issue in the raids than 5 man dungeons. I'm all for the no changes in regards to the loot system on the condition they have GMs like they used to have to resolve loot issues.</div></div><hr />

Let's get real: it can happen to anyone to hit Need instead of Greed, or that you decide you'd rather give an item to another person because they wear real shit compared to yours.<br />
<br />
Those &quot;advantageous&quot; situations far outnumber the &quot;abuse&quot; situations, it's so damn rare that a pre made consists of four people, but then rely on a random person to get a fifth, that by itself doesn't even guarantee the abuse, as it requires the intent of four other people to be a dickbag to another.<br />
Even then, you can just avoid the situation by inviting a class that doesn't use item your group wants.<br />
<br />
If you go into SM Armory because your Warrior buddy wants all the good stuff in there - don't invite another Warrior / Paladin / Shaman, it's that simple.<br />
<br />
The situation that actually makes the abuse possible is just too damn rare to justify a change that basically screws over everyone.</div></div><hr />

Classic doesn't apologize for being true to the original just because it was archaic, while Live doesn't even dare to have an actual target demographic anymore. No, EVERYONE has to be superhappy in BFA.<br />

Every time I read a post about Classic development I am hyped even more.

So that's why loot trading in raids is still on?<br />
This argument is stupid, as the point raised by Blizzard has nothing to do with preserving the integrity of the Vanilla ideal.<br />
<br />
It's about closing the potential loophole for abuse in 5man Dungeons.<br />
<br />
If it were about &quot;getting Vanilla&quot;, Blizzard would put redistribution via GM ticket back into Vanilla, but that doesn't happen due &quot;structural&quot; at Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

The only way to have the real Vanilla would be to have the exact patches cycle of Vanilla with the same exact release times from 1.0 to 1.12.2.<br />

I understand it would be nice, but it would require an enormous amount of work behind that is totally anti-echonomical and probably not necessary for the most part.</div></div><hr />

This argument is stupid, as the point raised by Blizzard has nothing to do with preserving the integrity of the Vanilla ideal.<br />
<br />
It's about closing the potential loophole for abuse in 5man Dungeons.<br />
<br />
If it were about &quot;getting Vanilla&quot;, Blizzard would put redistribution via GM ticket back into Vanilla, but that doesn't happen due &quot;structural&quot; at Blizzard.<br />
<br />
This 100% People should use some common sense...this really really does not change anything.<br />
I bet people that are all against this loot change would be huge drama queens if they lost a piece of good gear by some accident and had to wait 2-3 days to actually get it.<br />
I can see the threads already: &quot; OMG I have to wait 3 days for my gear WTF BLizz U suck &quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's get real: it can happen to anyone to hit Need instead of Greed, or that you decide you'd rather give an item to another person because they wear real shit compared to yours.<br />
<br />
Those &quot;advantageous&quot; situations far outnumber the &quot;abuse&quot; situations, it's so damn rare that a pre made consists of four people, but then rely on a random person to get a fifth, that by itself doesn't even guarantee the abuse, as it requires the intent of four other people to be a dickbag to another.<br />
Even then, you can just avoid the situation by inviting a class that doesn't use item your group wants.<br />
<br />
If you go into SM Armory because your Warrior buddy wants all the good stuff in there - don't invite another Warrior / Paladin / Shaman, it's that simple.<br />
<br />
The situation that actually makes the abuse possible is just too damn rare to justify a change that basically screws over everyone.<br />
<br />
I believe it just looks like the system is made so that internally it won't allow guildmates to abuse it. Let's be real, if it were available the chances of someone doing it would increase significantly. If it was all of a sudden completely legal to bot, the number of people that normally wouldn't bot would consider it or do it. <br />
<br />
I want to imagine it's in a case-by-case scenario though. If you're in a pug 5 man and a piece is accidentally needed, I can see how a GM would be more sympathetic than if it was 4 guildies and a pug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point still stands, if they are four people already, chances are they'll find a fifth within their guild just to not have that one random element (unless said fifth needs to be a Tank / Healer, but no one sane would screw over their Tank / Healer unless it's the final boss).<br />
<br />
But then also, four people with the same guild tag screwing over multiple random person will cause a stir sooner or later, reputation or whatnot is still a thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's be real, if it were available the chances of someone doing it would increase significantly. <br />
<br />
You'd still need to overcome to initial barriers to actually meet the described case, it's not like everyone will start grouping up as four in order to screw over a single person, there is no additional benefit over inviting a fifth person you know, unless you secretly dislike the fifth person.<br />
<br />
I'm not denying that it would happen - it would, but the actual incidents would still be very low, because you need:<br />
<br />
1.Four people who know each other but cannot find a fifth within the guild / friend list<br />
2.Four people being willing to screw over another person and thus potentially damage their own reputation and of their guild<br />
3.Them not just inviting a class that doesn't need loot they want in order to avoid any loot conflicts (or just four manning the dungeon to also avoid conflict)<br />
4.Person still has a 20% chance to win an item</div></div><hr />

Then, in raids where generally all are friends, or at least much more connected as a team, when mistakes happen (and they will) this will make resolution much easier and quicker, without having to strain Blizz resources or wait for any period of time to fix problems. This is great! Well done, Blizz - love this reasonable middle ground and all the other ways you're showing that you care, are listening, and most-importantly are acting on that feedback in ways that are faithful to the game/community.<br />

Absolutely - we had two paladins in our guild - Tomy and Talkintommy. When they're both called Tommy, and someone tells ML that Tommy won the roll, I mean of course there are problems. Being able to quickly fix mistakes when ML'ing raids is an important and rational compromise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raids need loot trading because people make mistakes. Rather than leave people with wasted loot over a mistake, or forcing people to submit a ticket for the mistake, might as well make loot tradeable there. You're also submitting to the raid's loot rules already, so what the raid leader does with the loot is already out of your control as not-the-raid-leader.<br />
<br />
Dungeons, on the other hand, are where people are going to take randos and try to fuck them out of loot in favor of people they like. If loot were tradeable there, we'd see it abused heavily, especially in the earlier days of the server when everyone's trying to rush to get ready for raiding. If someone mistakenly loots an item there, you can just run the dungeon again - No big deal. If anything, it encourages the person who made the mistake to help the person they just fucked out of loot by running again with them, thus fostering community.<br />
<br />
Can people just say &quot;Nah fuck that&quot; and leave anyway? Sure. I just think it's the right way to take the game. It prevents a common Classic problem without making such a big problem that people can't work around it.<br />

Or, just as simple as not inviting someone else who can use your gear: Don't hit need when you don't need it.<br />
<br />
Wait, you mean there's still potential for someone to hit Need??? Then there's equally as much potential that someone invites a Warrior to their mostly-Warrior group since 90% of tanks will need to level Warrior, and refusing to bring any Warriors when most people want a Warrior is going to be very, very difficult.<br />
<br />
The difference here is: Blizzard is stopping a group of people from abusing a situation, vs. you're complaining about an occasional asshole who might try to ninja your stuff and, therefore, ruin their reputation over it. I'd much rather they deal with the coordinated group as they won't lose reputation with the guild they agreed to do this with.</div></div><hr />

No, the point is that a decent change is reverted solely on the basis of a situation that will rarely ever occur.<br />
<br />
Being able to trade loot has nothing to do with ninja looting in a strict sense, ninja looting is putting on PM, then moving the stuff you want into your bags.<br />
Ninja looting, at least in the context of Vanilla, always involved Master loot, as in regular group loot, you could roll need on literally anything without any actual repercussions, unless you consider rolling need on everything ninja looting.<br />
<br />
Being able to trade loot doesn't prevent or fixes ninja looting, they want to have it, not give it to you.</div></div><hr />

It has plenty of value, because your evaluation of what is likely and what is rare doesn't jive with others experiences. A number of people great enough that was able to sway Blizzard into changing their game design. <br />
<br />
<br />
Considering Blizzard explicitly described four people, i'd say yes, it was damn rare.<br />

Blizzard gave an example of 4 people, the same could be said for 2 or 3. What they did there was called providing an example, complex stuff I know.<br />
<br />
<br />
And if the last spot is a dps, it took absolutely no time to fill that one.<br />
<br />
And the 3rd dps comes in, is a warlock and has to roll against the mage who's with his friends. Mage rolls, priest rolls as well because cloth, warlock rolls. Priest out-roll's everyone but the warlock rolled 2nd. Priest says fuck the lock and hands the gear to his friend, lock is successfully fucked. <br />

It really doesn't once you think about it.<br />

<br />
It’s possible that abusive play could take the form of a group of four players colluding to deny loot to a stranger who joined their party as a pick-up.<br />
<br />
It's not an example, it's describing a specific case.<br />
If they dislike the &quot;loot abuse&quot; as a whole, why not just describe the general case? Person A is friends with Person B, Person B needs item X, Person A also rolls on X to possibly trade it to B.<br />
<br />
Bit odd, isn't it? But yeah, let's pick the least likely example.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And the 3rd dps comes in, is a warlock and has to roll against the mage who's with his friends. Mage rolls, priest rolls as well because cloth, warlock rolls. Priest out-roll's everyone but the warlock rolled 2nd. Priest says fuck the lock and hands the gear to his friend, lock is successfully fucked. <br />
<br />
<br />
First off, the statement was obviously primarily targeted at<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and often took quite some time to fill the spot.<br />
<br />
Because you just never have any issues finding a dps.<br />
<br />
Second, at least i watched out when building groups that the setup was balanced in terms loot, having three clothies was just bad.<br />
It's just one of those things that can be easily avoided, if you're a Mage and a Priest in a group, why in the world would you invite a Lock as 3rd dps?<br />
<br />
It's just bound to lead to trouble if you have three people rolling on the same loot within a 5man dungeon.<br />
<br />
I mean, let's entertain that thought for a moment, even if you have the intent to roll on an item despite not needing it, only to trade it to your partner, your plan still has a 33% chance of failing, if you would just invite a Rogue, Hunter or whatnot, that chance goes down to 0%.<br />
<br />
If you are the leader of a group, you have full control over what goes into your group, but if you just straight on pass on avoiding loot conflict by building your group properly and rely on loot trade to get your loot, your plan always has a legitimate chance at failing because the one person you might want to screw over still can win the roll.<br />
<br />
This isn't dungeon finder where you randomnly get assigned to a group and have to deal with it.</div></div><hr />

Wow, look, you point out exactly how ninja looting occurred in Classic without Master Loot.<br />
<br />
Yes, you could ninja loot to shard, you could ninja loot to sell, you could ninja loot you didn't need or couldn't use - The most common ninja loot was a DPS needing over a tank, gear that the tank could use, so they could gear to tank while DPSing. Just because YOU don't consider it ninja looting, doesn't mean it isn't. It is still ninja looting, and this change prevents a group from abusing it.<br />
<br />
You can ignore a single party leader in raids if they want to ninja loot from you. Call them out and ruin their reputation. That's the same as classic. This change doesn't prevent that whatsoever.<br />
You can't ignore a group of guildmates who fuck you over because they can steal loot from you without consequences. This change prevents that. And before you bring up the 4 player example again, learn how examples work - They don't have to describe every scenario, they just have to get their point across, and their example does exactly that. Common? Doesn't have to be - It got the point across, which is that players can easily group up to fuck over someone else.</div></div><hr />

Let's get real: it can happen to anyone to hit Need instead of Greed, or that you decide you'd rather give an item to another person because they wear real shit compared to yours.<br />
<br />
Those &quot;advantageous&quot; situations far outnumber the &quot;abuse&quot; situations, it's so damn rare that a pre made consists of four people, but then rely on a random person to get a fifth, that by itself doesn't even guarantee the abuse, as it requires the intent of four other people to be a dickbag to another.<br />
Even then, you can just avoid the situation by inviting a class that doesn't use item your group wants.<br />
<br />
If you go into SM Armory because your Warrior buddy wants all the good stuff in there - don't invite another Warrior / Paladin / Shaman, it's that simple.<br />
<br />
The situation that actually makes the abuse possible is just too damn rare to justify a change that basically screws over everyone.<br />
<br />

It can never be full vanilla experience unless you play it on win XP, on your CRT monitor in your parents living room.<br />
Without high speed internet, without Discord, without modern addons, <br />

This is purely personal inattention and shouldn't be somehow encouraged or be forgiven and it doesn’t matter whether it happens in open world or in raid - law should be 1 for all and not like &quot;and if so/then may be&quot;, no.

Mage rolls, priest rolls as well because cloth, warlock rolls. Priest out-roll's everyone but the warlock rolled 2nd. Priest says fuck the lock and hands the gear to his friend, lock is successfully fucked. <br />
<br />
Loot trading in pug's is garbage.<br />
<br />
How is that any different from what it was back in the day?<br />
<br />
Even back then you could do exactly what you said... but instead of simply trading the item you have to make a ticket and GM will at some point do it for you.<br />
Exactly the same outcome and the warlock still gets screwed. (this is what most people in here dont understand... loot trading did exist back then, it just required a GM to do it for you)<br />
<br />
Only difference is: a GM doesnt need to waste their time on something that can be automated.<br />
<br />
Guess what the warlock can do? if he notices that the group is not giving him any loot then he can just quit the group... then they have to find another dps, sure it doesnt take long but its vanilla... they have to go into a city to ask and then they still have to wait for him to reach the dungeon and since the warlock just left they have no summons.<br />
<br />
This type of effort you have to go through to simply replace someone in group might just make you think twice about not giving equal rights to looting. :P<br />
Your gonna waste your own time if you dont.<br />

i actually like this change<br />
<br />
now in dungeons i can ninja everything for disenchant/gold under excuse &quot;sorry misclicked&quot; <br />
<br />
cannot wait when this change bites in the ass the crowd which supported it :)<br />
<br />
also cannot wait to laugh into the face of crowd who thinks they are gonna be blacklisting anything :) gl blacklisting tank/healer ^^<br />
<br />
Theres no need for luck there... theres plenty of fish in the sea so one tank/healer less is no big deal. :P<br />
<br />
And considering servers are communities, everyone will know your name and you can do nothing about it. :)<br />
<br />
Youd be surprised how many people are rolling tanks and healers, its not going to be as rare as it seems.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kralljin</div><div class="date">2019-03-23, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Except that Fury is one of the best DPS specs in Vanilla as well.<br />
<br />
Yeah, because Fury will be topdog in 5 man Dungeons where everyone has green / blue gear.<br />
If you have the gear to pull off decent fury Dps, you're raid geared or have already the perfect items for Fury from 5 man dungeons.<br />
Meaning that someone who actually does good dps as fury doesn't need 5 Man dungeons anymore.<br />
<br />
What you are pointing out is a conundrum, especially in the light of the fact that the majority of 5 man dungeons are leveling dungeons, where Fury will rarely ever be topdog unless it's a twink and you feed the warrior topnotch items for every level bracket.<br />
<br />
There's a reason why most people played Arms during leveling, first because it's easier to get a single good two-Handed weapon instead of two good one-handed ones and it did not nearly rely on +Hit% as much as Fury, which was nearly nonexistant on gear below 50.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Spoiler, if everyone needs a tank, at some point, everyone is going to need to level and gear a warrior through 5 mans. Also spoiler, the large majority of warriors will need to be DPS before Naxx comes out and the need for 8 tanks comes up.<br />
<br />
Because Tank shortage will not be an issue, right? <br />
Why can't this flood of warriors just tank?<br />
<br />
Because they don't want? <br />
Oh well, at least one thing from the Vanilla / BC era returning where Warriors who refuse to tank under any circumstance basically become the bottom feeders in the world of PUG's.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what you are trying to argue here at this point, nor the relevancy to this topic, it's not like i need two Warriors (or more) to do freaking 5 man dungeons.<br />
Fuck me, the vast majority of dungeons below 60 (a.k.a. most 5 man dungeons) can also be done with a Feral Tank - because they're fucking easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, you could ninja loot to shard, you could ninja loot to sell, you could ninja loot you didn't need or couldn't use<br />
<br />
And if you did that, you most likely got kicked from your group instantly.<br />
<br />
In order to get serious benefit from your behavior you basically have to sack every green / blue dropping within the instance, a single blue item that you just want to disenchant / sell isn't worth the hassle of &quot;ninja'ing&quot; - unless you want to deliberatily deny a person one item.<br />
<br />
Do you think a party just sits there and watches you roll need on everything, if you're the party leader, you'll soon be alone, if you're not, then you'll get kicked quickly unless you drop it - even as tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just because YOU don't consider it ninja looting, doesn't mean it isn't. It is still ninja looting, and this change prevents a group from abusing it.<br />
<br />
And you decide what is ninja looting and what isn't?<br />
If you want to argue that my definition of ninja looting isn't set in stone, neither is yours.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can ignore a single party leader in raids if they want to ninja loot from you. Call them out and ruin their reputation. That's the same as classic. This change doesn't prevent that whatsoever.<br />
You can't ignore a group of guildmates who fuck you over because they can steal loot from you without consequences. This change prevents that.<br />
<br />
If the party leader puts on ML and if the the group agrees in fucking you over via trading, it's the same thing, except with Master looter you are 100% denied the chance of getting any loot.<br />
<br />
If you join a group of four, you are at their mercy, that is the long and short of it, if they want to fuck you over, they will.<br />
<br />
<br />
They don't have to describe every scenario<br />
<br />
I'd raise the most common one - two people agree'ing to fuck someone else over, but even that requires the other two people turn a blind eye on what just happened.<br />
It only really works in the four player scenario because there is no one else that could drop the group besides you.<br />
<br />
If just two people do it, then one of the two other player might outlash against them and drop the group.</div></div><hr />

Unlike modern WoW, you don't 'automatically' find a group. You have to actively seek out players, and if you act like an ass, your reputation will precede you.<br />

In short, I really don't feel like there is as big of a risk of 'loot abuse' as people are making it out to be.</div></div><hr />

This is a QoL change for Blizzard more than anything. So many tickets back in the day were for loot mistakes. And they can't just say, &quot;there's nothing we can do about it&quot; because in vanilla they would do something about it, it would just take a few days.<br />

RP it then, if you miss it so much.<br />
<br />
Make an alt, called &quot;Blizztickets&quot;, send a message to it, that an item that was meant for you, went to the other guy, and you would really like to get it (that already got fixed, thanks to loot trading).<br />
<br />
Then, wait 3-7 days, log in with your &quot;Blizztickets&quot; alt, and reply to the message that the item (that you already have) has been sent to you.<br />
<br />
Then squeal with joy, that you can finally use the item (That you have had for 3-7 days)!</div></div><hr />

With this personality, I fully expect you to be a terrible tank or healer so being a ninja isn't making your already soiled reputation that much worse. Add to that you won't make it past level 30 anyways so, good luck I guess?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, the point is that a decent change is reverted solely on the basis of a situation that will rarely ever occur.<br />
<br />
Being able to trade loot has nothing to do with ninja looting in a strict sense, ninja looting is putting on PM, then moving the stuff you want into your bags.<br />
Ninja looting, at least in the context of Vanilla, always involved Master loot, as in regular group loot, you could roll need on literally anything without any actual repercussions, unless you consider rolling need on everything ninja looting.<br />
<br />
Being able to trade loot doesn't prevent or fixes ninja looting, they want to have it, not give it to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are ignoring the much more common situation of 2 or 3 friends/guildies doing a dungeon and inviting a couple of pugs. Even just having a friend with you to roll need for you gives you an extra roll against everyone else in the group, and would be incredibly common.<br />
<br />
Don't understand why you are butthurt about it, if there is a genuine mistake you will still be able to open a ticket.</div></div><hr />

It would essentially mean that Blizzard played itself.<br />
They most likely won't be putting GM's on redistrubuting duty whether you won the item &quot;by accident&quot; or had &quot;abusive intent&quot;.<br />
