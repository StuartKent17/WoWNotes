Longer episode by a couple of minutes with some actual bike stuff, much better but too much time devoted to &quot;it's cold in NY and warm in CA&quot;<br />
<br />
So the 5 week timeline, first four episodes were week 1? This is &quot;half way&quot;</div></div><hr />

The Alliance bike looks as if it moves about as fast as a snail though and the horde bike not much quicker. <br />
<br />
The Horde bike: It's not really a bike or a chopper is it! It's a friggin trike/Tank track hybrid!.<br />
The Alliance bike: Just some slow tank track thing, again not a chopper and looks fairly crap tbh.</div></div><hr />

There is no winter in California. No need for winter clothes there and it would be silly to buy expensive clothes for a one short trip.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, they'll put both in game but only the winning side will end up getting theirs for free. Other faction will have to buy them from a vendor(possibly both factions depending on if you have to be an active account when they award the mounts for free).</div></div><hr />

-in this vid they said they have half the time remaining and i guess this will end on the 10th episode or so<br />
-obviously both choppers will be available in game and i am fairly sure both free or engineering craft (each faction with their own or heck why not both to each faction)<br />
-i guess they chose both choppers to have threads since its snowing there where they build them and it works better to test them ( also perhaps they chose them since our current in game choppers/trike are wheels based so they wanted something new)</div></div><hr />

If not then roll your level 1 Horde and get a bike.<br />

I wouldn't buy the Alliance bike unless it changes a lot from the way it looks now.Mount collectors don't care much where the mount comes from, where it belongs to.. They get it regardless. <br />
I personally would not buy it, I've never bought a mount in the store. Would not matter to me which one ends up there. But I am not a big mount collector either. I have 164 mounts, and I do not chase after any. I take them as they fall into my lap.</div></div><hr />

Well, it kind of DOES matter, precisely because not everyone will get it if they really go with whatever faction wins.<br />
<br />
I have 11 90s and they are all Alliance and on a single server.<br />
So if Horde wins that means I have to play one of my 85 Horde characters on a seperate server to ever see/use the mount. Not complaining about a free mount, but it's kind of a dick move to give the mount to half the playerbase, simply because they decided to play that faction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen similar things to this before, but here is just a summed up list of how unsatisfiable the WoW community (or any large customer community really) is as a whole:<br />
<br />
If Blizzard cured cancer, people would complain about nerfed tumors.<br />
If Blizzard created world peace, people would complain about missing world PvP.<br />
If Blizzard ended world hunger, people would complain about the decreased difficulty of living and catering to casuals.<br />
If Blizzard successfully colonized Mars, people would complain about phasing out Earth.<br />
If Blizzard discovered cold fusion, people would complain that coal needs buffs. <br />
If Blizzard successfully gave 10 gigabit fiber connections for FREE to every human being on earth, people would get nostalgic for lag. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard created a raid tier with 4 different non-linear raids and 34 different raid bosses, people would complain that they were forced to raid too much to clear each week. <br />
If Blizzard created a raid tier with 5 bosses and no trash, people would complain that the raid is too short and they have to raid on alts to fill time. (Sound familiar?)<br />
<br />
If Blizzard gave every WoW player a Ferrari for Christmas, people would complain that A. They like &lt;insert other car&gt; better and B. Why does Blizzard not care about &lt;insert other holiday&gt;. <br />
If Blizzard made WoW free to play but kept the game the exact same, people would complain that they are letting all the casuals in.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard paid for the college educations of every highschool grad in America, people would complain about being 'forced' to go to college.<br />
If Blizzard paid for anyone who got a 3.5+ GPA in college to go to grad school, people would complain that they are only catering to those with time to devote to their education.<br />
<br />
Should I go on?<br />
<br />
I guarantee you there is not a single thing Blizzard can do that will evoke no measure of complaining from the community, simply because it is impossible to make a decision that millions of people will whole heartedly agree with. It's not just a problem unique to Blizzard, although I have to say their version of it may be the most entertaining.<br />

<br />
Longer episode by a couple of minutes with some actual bike stuff, much better but too much time devoted to &quot;it's cold in NY and warm in CA&quot;<br />
<br />
So the 5 week timeline, first four episodes were week 1? This is &quot;half way&quot;<br />
<br />
From what I remember of American Chopper, 2 of the weeks will be paint and powder coat I think, so it's highly unlikely they'll show much from that stretch of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with others who have said, it's pretty unlikely they'll only give it to one faction. Even if they do, they'll make the other available either through the shop or after a bit.<br />
<br />
My reasoning: The show already took place weeks/months ago, we are seeing it unfold over the course of weeks after the whole thing took place and the bikes were already built. They did some production on the webisodes but they are so short that could be done in a couple weeks. They used the in between time to already design the mounts for the game, they've already built or are building BOTH. They are a business, they wouldn't bother paying for the construction of and the in-game design of two mounts to only release one.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, the treads conflict with the bike's streamlined design.<br />
<br />
I can see what they were going for with the lobstered steel, so when the bronze filigree is applied, hopefully it'll come together more. The problem is Blizzard doesn't really do the lobstered armor look. However, if it fits together well and has the appearance if a single piece of armor, I think it'll work.<br />

.<br />
<br />
Correct on your thinking but this isn't limited to just one game, or even one profession dude. This happens everywhere, if people don't complain or point out problems then how you gonna fix them. Nothing is ever perfect but all you can do is alter the mould due to changes you can't keep on running the same game adding more branches without pruning them otherwise you have a big mess.<br />
<br />
Another problem and real big one with your statement you have to sort out for whinging and complaints. Whinging is only this &quot;Your an idiot&quot; is a whinge, however &quot;This ability is shit cause it locks you for 5 seconds meaning i do nothing&quot; is not is a genuine complaint, cause your removing someone out of combat for 5 seconds when its promoted as a fast action game. &quot;Sure this is nothing but a whinge&quot; no it isn't the problem is presented in a format no savage attacks on anyone and just promotes the problem that's in the game. If its intended they can explain and say well its suppose to be in the game if not they add probably an item to break out of it or make it less effective if spammed cast (SEE mind control problem in WOW). <br />
<br />
You have to be careful when you attack people cause right now you are just a whinger attacking people without fixing up the problem, cause at the moment your saying the game is perfect when it's not, nothing is perfect. Complaint points out a problem or can help other people find a solution or suggest an idea, where as whinging does not (which you reply falls in).</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can have it done in 5 weeks and just show the episodes over 8 weeks. I doubt building vs shooting is done real time.<br />
<br />
The horde builders are down a man and their bike looks vastly superior to the alliance. You can clearly see which team has the talent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/sarcasm<br />
<br />
This was by far the best episode yet. The alliance bike is going to look regal with Varian sitting on top, but the horde one is going beast mode!</div></div><hr />

I do always avoid posting here because of people like these. People that could get a free house and ask the universe why aren't they getting a whole city.<br />
<br />
Really, this kind of posts makes me want to sat away from comments section, and i'm sure i'm not the only one. Reading pages full of this only promotes watching the main page without even reading comments. What for? Theres a ton of people here filled with nonsense rage and a sensation of &quot;you Blizzard must please my ego constantly but also know you're never reaching that goal due to REASONS&quot;. Probably the same players that enjoy pulling a whole instance and leaving, and all the kind of unsatisfied childish things we see in game everyday.<br />
<br />
Sad.<br />
<br />
Moving in on topic, I really enjoyed the episode. I'm kind of curious where the Alliance bike is heading to, since so far the Horde one seems to capture more the faction's spirit.</div></div><hr />

The bikes are looking sick as fuck!</div></div><hr />

It'll probably be a photo op thing at Blizzcon too, but yeah I think they want to replicate the success of the Shaohao webseries, and the cinematic guy seems really passionate about this and other various promotional projects he's been working on</div></div><hr />

I'll admit I was on the &quot;where the fuck are they going with this&quot; train until I saw this picture, but once you add the colour scheme it will actually look amazing...<br />
<br />
...if they lose the treads and use actual wheels :p</div></div><hr />

Will reserve judgement until bikes are complete of course.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Killala</div><div class="date">2014-05-16, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking solid. The Alli bike does look kind of buggy right now though, not sure how I feel about that... Horde's seem to be really getting the right feeling, especially with those tusks and chains. Alliance just kind of looks awkward. I really hate those treads. <br />
<br />
Pretty sure both bikes will end up in the game regardless of who &quot;wins&quot;... time to level a horde alt I guess!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have 11 90s and they are all Alliance and on a single server.<br />
So if Horde wins that means I have to play one of my 85 Horde characters on a seperate server to ever see/use the mount. Not complaining about a free mount, but it's kind of a dick move to give the mount to half the playerbase, simply because they decided to play that faction.<br />
<br />
That's no dick move. That's a typical fucking Vote? The one thing with the most Support wins, the other one loses. A Vote. <br />
<br />
And the &quot;half the Playerbase&quot; phrase too? Oh my fucking God. Yeah, you know what that's the thing when it's FACTION SPECIFIC. I want Stormwind for the Horde - That's my Argument now and you know what? It's kind of a dick move we don't have Stormwind, because you know... Half the Playerbase. <br />
<br />
Anyways, aside from that nonsense, both Factions are probably going to get their own one anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Druidjezus</div><div class="date">2014-05-20, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct on your thinking but this isn't limited to just one game, or even one profession dude. This happens everywhere, if people don't complain or point out problems then how you gonna fix them. Nothing is ever perfect but all you can do is alter the mould due to changes you can't keep on running the same game adding more branches without pruning them otherwise you have a big mess.<br />
<br />
Another problem and real big one with your statement you have to sort out for whinging and complaints. Whinging is only this &quot;Your an idiot&quot; is a whinge, however &quot;This ability is shit cause it locks you for 5 seconds meaning i do nothing&quot; is not is a genuine complaint, cause your removing someone out of combat for 5 seconds when its promoted as a fast action game. &quot;Sure this is nothing but a whinge&quot; no it isn't the problem is presented in a format no savage attacks on anyone and just promotes the problem that's in the game. If its intended they can explain and say well its suppose to be in the game if not they add probably an item to break out of it or make it less effective if spammed cast (SEE mind control problem in WOW). <br />
<br />
You have to be careful when you attack people cause right now you are just a whinger attacking people without fixing up the problem, cause at the moment your saying the game is perfect when it's not, nothing is perfect. Complaint points out a problem or can help other people find a solution or suggest an idea, where as whinging does not (which you reply falls in).<br />
<br />
I think you missed my point entirely... I'm not saying it's perfect or that people don't have legitimate complaints.<br />
<br />
It's more like, there is NO perfect because you can't please everyone.<br />
<br />
For example, Person A wants Warlocks to be able to easily beat rogues, Person B wants rogues to faceroll warlocks. Blizzard says &quot;we'll make them competitive with each other&quot; but ultimately that doesn't satisfy Person A or Person B. Obviously that's an example where their expectations are unrealistic in a game environment where the goal is all classes being competitive and no hard counters.<br />
<br />
Take another, more reasonable example though:<br />
Person A wants to have access to truly challenging small group content that is also rewarding in gear (AKA, not challenge modes). They are a former heroic raider and only the absolutely most difficult content will present much of a challenge to them.<br />
<br />
Person B wants access to those same rewards but doesn't know many people in WoW. The content is too difficult to do with LFD so Blizzard doesn't make it available, their gear isn't high enough to get into PuGs on their server because people only take the best geared people they can find for simplicity.<br />
<br />
Person A wants the content to be hard, Person B wants that same content to be easier and more accessible. These are both VALID feedback, but you CAN'T please both. The closest Blizzard can come to it is making two separate difficulties, but then people want the gear to be lesser on the lower difficulty so that they feel rewarded for going through the challenge, then people in the lower difficulty still complain because they want to be able to access the best gear.<br />
<br />
It's an endless cycle, and it all boils down to when you have people with nearly diametrically opposed viewpoints you cannot fully satisfy both, you can only hope to make compromises that each will find acceptable. <br />
<br />
As I said, this is not unique to WoW, if you want a great example of it look at politics. You can't please everyone and it is foolish to try. All I was getting as it that WoW players are very entertaining in how they handle Blizzard doing things that cater to players other than themselves.</div></div><hr />
