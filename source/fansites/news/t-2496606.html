What happened to stealth?<br />
Since 8.2 I have had so many stealth, prowling, and feign death fails I have lost track. Did these abilities get a serious reconfiguration or can I just blame this on the terrible bodyguard system that has been forced on us in Nazjatar?<br />
<br />
Sometimes the bodyguard feigns death too, but more often than not they do not. My druid and rogue have also had their prowl, stealth, and vanish abilities completely thrown out the window during gameplay with one of these bodyguards around. Sometimes an enemy will find me from distances where it seems like I should have escaped their threat already anyhow.<br />
This is something that we are actively working on. We hope to have a hotfix out soon that will help your follower vanish so keep an eye out for it.

[Bug] Berserker Stance<br />
Modifiers to Critical Strike chance are reduced against enemies 3 levels higher than the player-character. We tested a variety of modifiers to Critical Strike, such as: Berserker Stance, the Cruelty talent, and critical strike chance on gear. They all behaved the same as they did in 1.12, so we’ve concluded that there’s no bug here. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1106877-bug-berserker-stance/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/196414/9))<br />
<br />
I’m not going to get too deep into the specific math on this one, but for the sake of clarity, I’ll say that this is not a per-aura modifier and it is separate than the 3% suppression that is baseline against +3 level creatures. There is a single modifier placed on total Critical Strike gained from auras that increase Crit chance such as those I listed in my last post.

As far as I can tell, the feign fails when the follower is actively casting spells on an enemy. If it was healing me or not doing anything, he feigns with me, but if he's attacking, he doesn't. Always a nice sight, me pulling 10+ mobs while running through a cave, feigning at the exit, two pets who drop dead too, and one stupid follower in the middle of the pack casting little bolts at them...</div></div><hr />

Your tinfoil hat seems to be on a bit to tight. And the &quot;everything works fine in every other zone&quot; is straight up false, even if it doesn't support your bs. <br />
<br />
If you're so convinced the company is out to get you, why still play their game? Or if you don't, why waste other people's time by crying on the forum?</div></div><hr />
