Please note that the Armory won't be available during the sale. <br />
To further ensure ticket sales for this year's BlizzCon remains a smooth process for everyone who intends to purchase tickets, we'll be temporarily taking down the World of Warcraft Armory. This is being done to further alleviate potential load on our website.<br />

<br />
Really it was sold out in seconds, since you had to be in the queue to buy in less than one minute in order to make it to the front of the line before they were sold out.<br />
<br />
But the line to buy them for $500 from the guys in the FIRST line is now forming on eBay! ::)</div></div><hr />

This depends on your state.<br />
It's perfectly legal in California to buy and resell tickets to an event.<br />
<br />
Some states allow face-value only, others allow 2x face-value, and still others not at all.<br />
But since it's in CA... welcome to their laws.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragnafrak</div><div class="date">2009-05-17, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How's this for a sob story-<br />
<br />

<br />
That was my place in line when I entered the queue at 9:56 AM PST. For some reason, I could see the tickets on the website before my brother in the next room or my friend down the block. I got through the line in about 2 minutes and got to the purchase page without any problems.<br />
<br />
I saw that my credit card information was still saved from the last time I bought Blizzcon tix in 2008. &quot;Great,&quot; I thought. &quot;That just makes it faster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the website goes something like, &quot;We are unable to process your transaction. If you continue to receive this message after subsequent attempts, contact Blizzard Customer Support.&quot;<br />
<br />
Subsequent attempts, eh? That must mean it's okay to try again, right? Wrong. <br />
<br />
I tried a few times with the same card info before goin' back to check on the info. It turned out that the form was not submitting my billing address at all. The field was still blank! Funny, that it would allow me to try and process a transaction with a &quot;required&quot; field left blank. I inputted the info and tried again. Still no go.<br />
<br />
So I called Blizzard Customer Support to get things fixed! Nope, they can't do anything either. All the CSR had to say was that the problem was probably with the correctness of my info. He had me read off my info over the phone so he could input it himself for me to try, then I put in 2 more credit cards and tried those. All my info was correct, so what's the problem?<br />
<br />
Turns out, if the website sees you making multiple unsuccessful attempts to purchase tickets you get flagged for possible fraudulent activity and the website blocks you from proceeding! By the time the CSR got around to telling me this part of the program my 15 minutes was already mostly up and he was giving me the, &quot;Sorry. Better luck next time&quot; spiel.<br />
<br />
Now, after getting so damn lucky in the queue as to nab a 700's spot right off the get go, I have to sit on my ass and wait another two weeks. <br />
<br />

How well obviously you have 15mins to finalize your purchase when you actually reach the front of the line. Perhaps someone who actually bought tickets could let me know if they did this or not. But Blizz should......<br />
<br />
Have them do it like Comic-Con and E3 do it. MAKE THEM PUT THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE WHO THEY ARE BUYING TICKETS FOR AS IT APPEARS ON THEIR ID's during those 15mins. <br />
<br />
Now I was already pissed off because I was logged in the store, went to purchase 2 tickets, then when it took me to the store it made me log in again. Totally losing my place in line making me go in a que. And like many other people I saw posting My que kept going up instead of down. I started off 150th in que then I went to 21k in que. I basically just gave up and went back to sleep.</div></div><hr />
