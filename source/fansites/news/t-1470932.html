<br />
http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/gb-en.png Free Character Migrations Available (EU)<br />
If you're on one of the source realms listed below, you can move your characters to one of the designated destination realms and avoid the queues—for free!<br />
<br />
By initiating one of these transfers, you will be moving your character to a new realm and home. This is a one-time, one-way move. If you wish to move your character elsewhere, you will need to use the paid transfer service (https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/services/pct-select.html?).<br />
<br />
<br />
Silvermoon =&gt; Magtheridon / Azuremyst<br />
Kazzak / Outland / Stormscale =&gt; Auchindoun<br />
<br />
<br />
Please be aware that, due to the unpredictable nature of free transfers, we may close down any Free Character Migrations at any time and without warning if the target realm becomes full. If you plan to move with friends or your guild, we suggest that you coordinate the effort to reduce the chance of any stragglers being left behind.<br />
<br />
Early closures aside, this set of Free Character Migrations will end on Tuesday, March 11<br />
<br />
Begin a Free Character Migration now (https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/fcm/character-list.html?r=EU&amp;l=WoW1)! We recommend reviewing the FAQ (https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/free-character-migration), as it details what is or isn't allowed for transferred characters.<br />

In the video he is spec'd BM, so it automatically chooses Versatility. Lone Wolf will still be available for MM/Surv, as far as I know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You still can as far as I am aware. The talent &quot;With or Without You&quot; changes based on spec. If you are BM it is &quot;Versatility&quot;, if you are MM or SV it is &quot;Lone Wolf.&quot;<br />

If you choose BM spec the &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; talent turns into the one you see on video. If you are Survival or MM, however, you can pick the &quot;petless hunter&quot; a.k.a Lone Wolf talent. All the classes will have those &quot;smart talent&quot; options that change based on spec. Source: Celestalon, MMO-Champion front page and WoWHead talent calculator.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bro, remember that they are doing interesting things with talents in WoD where some change based on spec. Versatility will be for BM while the with or without you talent will still be there for Survival/MM hunters (for now). We will still have petless fun (hopefully).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Watch the video you will see him spec BM before choosing his talents so the With or Without you talent is changed to versatility. If he specs surv/MM it would be called lonewolf<br />
<br />
As for the other talents the flaming arrows seems meh and the focusing shot will be very situational indeed.<br />
<br />
I play bm so my pick will be versatility<br />

<br />
Those level hundred talents change depending on what spec you are. Instead of having ridiculous walls of text for every spec in the tooltips they just show the relevant talent info for whatever spec you chose.<br />
<br />
If you go Surv / MM you can still choose the with or without you talent if you want to play with no pet.<br />
<br />
Also the bosses in the dungeon journal are obviously place holders for the Beta. This should be obvious when you see that not a single boss in spires of Arak is an Arakkoa and that all 4 ogre bosses have the exact same model... I say it's obvious but from reading the youtube video comments it's not obvious to a lot of people.<br />
<br />
Also getting tired of QQ about all the character models having the same faces... It's Beta. That is obviously not how things will be on live so don't waste your time complaining about it. It's this sort of stuff that makes blizz reluctant to share things with the community before completion.</div></div><hr />

I picked my hunter in large part because of the pet. However with all the pathing issues pets have sometimes i'd rather I could play without it. Whenever there's a fight with dumb pathing issues I just wont use my pet in future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
great &gt;_&gt; personally I like playing surv and I thought the versatility looked pretty interesting.<br />
So basically for me it means my lv 90 talents will be either a boring flaming arrow or a focus generating refurbished focus shot &gt;_&gt; reason I play a hunter is because of the pets so lone wolf talent is out of the question.. well that's a rather dull lv 90 talent choice<br />

I really hope they spice up the flaming arrow one.</div></div><hr />

hunters are not losing the ability to fight without pets. the 3rd 100lvl talent &quot;with or without you&quot; simply makes the ability stance specific. Beast masters who choose this talent<br />
<br />
will get a dps boost to their pets as well as a bunch of pet bilities <br />
while the other specs get Lone Wolf, the solo hunter ability.</div></div><hr />

You see there is this thing called placeholder models, those are put in place when stuff doesn't have a unique model yet and just needs one for the time being. I know it is a hard concept to grasp but thats the truth.</div></div><hr />

errrm. that's how char creation works right now...people see an example set of &quot;built up&quot; gear on their chars at higher levels.<br />
<br />
But all this is irrelevant because this is ALPHA. It is NOT the finished product. You complaining over the char creation is a load of bull because not only is it not important but in alpha it is in NO WAY reflective of the end product. Yet you complain as if it is. This is tentament to screaming about a pire of iron ore and planks of wood not being suitable for sitting on.</div></div><hr />

So basically for me it means my lv 90 talents will be either a boring flaming arrow or a focus generating refurbished focus shot &gt;_&gt; reason I play a hunter is because of the pets so lone wolf talent is out of the question.. well that's a rather dull lv 90 talent choice<br />
<br />
I really hope they spice up the flaming arrow one.<br />
<br />
Yeah right. And I'll hope they spice up Ignite Weapon for the Warrior.. totally.. I mean.. Fire Damage.. Come on Blizz! Give me something that doesn't ignore all Resistances and all Armor of my Target, thus making the 80% WPDMG actually Ignore Armor..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Losing stampede is a huge burst cd and a big loss to our ability to do certain aspects. I remember my group could not have killed every weapon on the belt in h siegecrafter if we didnt have 3 hunters rotating stampede. Losing that will hurt us big time. <br />
<br />
Also, they probably didn't remove lynx rush bc petless wont have a pet, but more so bc 0 people used it once it was nerfed. If it was because you wouldn't have a pet, then they would remove Blink Strikes as well.<br />

Disappointing, really. Hopefully some things will be reworked still.</div></div><hr />

No, the Velen that dies is OUR velen that's why they have a new leader of the exodar, the male pally or the female priest maybe both.<br />
Also that is Our Thrall he is going with us, dude why else did he leave Vul'jin behind, Thrall is also dropping the shaman rags and putting him armor back on but I hope/pray that Blizzard will make a texture update to Thrall's armor being that is a newer doomhammer model than the one in the game which is more purple in color.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, what kind of weirdo plays a hunter for the buggy, annoying, gimmicky pet? <br />
<br />
I play my hunter because he can shoot a trap full of snakes out of a gun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree...I like Marksman, I like my Pet, and I like to PvP...the options would of made Hunter a no go for me.<br />
<br />
I wonder if Essence of the Viper will increase the damage of Flaming Shots...</div></div><hr />

OH LOOK, ORCS HAVE DIFFERENT FACES<br />
<br />
you must be joking right?<br />
<br />
Funny, seeing how just about every post listed on that videos comment section mentioned how there was no variety, everyone spotting it. Yet a few wrinkles convinces you theres variety.<br />
<br />
Maybe in valley of the clones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc8185f7018a</div><div class="date">2014-03-10, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I may not be up to date with the story of WoD, but if I understood correctly, Garrosh goes to the past to create the Iron Horde 31 years in the past to be more precise, before The Legion got grip of the orcs. And when WoD goes live, we, noble defenders of Azeroth go to this alternate universe created by Garrosh's incursion but we go through the portal that only takes us through space and not through time so we go to Draenor like it is 31 years after Garrosh meddled with it. I hope I am clear and right until now. <br />
Now to actually make my point: if all that is written above is true, then how can Drek'Thar claim (as seen in the last - WoD gameplay movie youtube.com/watch?v=cBkMaq5keLA&amp;list=PLSUoPsd4rukaC6bzp3T3qORfN0blnED0G#t=49 ) that the leader of the clan is Durotan, a noble soul that is YOUNG, bla bla but still VERY YOUNG ??? I mean if this is a parallel universe that was exactly the same as ours up to 31 years ago, how can Durotan still be very young?</div></div><hr />
