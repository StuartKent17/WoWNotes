Diablo III: Stay Awhile and Listen<br />
Blizzard just released the new community site for Diablo 3, which explains why the community team has been on and off on WoW for a while while they were finishing it up I guess! It looks pretty nice and is based on the battle.net format of the existing community sites. <br />
Our new Diablo III community site (http://us.battle.net/d3/en/) has gone live! This will be your sanctuary for all the latest developments from New Tristram and beyond, featuring community forums and regular blog updates. Just like this site, you can post comments and share Diablo III news items via Twitter, Facebook, and other popular social media outlets. You'll want to check out the new Diablo III news feed regularly. We’ll use it to share everything about Diablo III and to highlight recent community activity, including your most entertaining videos, art, comics, fansites, and much more.<br />
We hope you head over and get acquainted with the new site, and return often. We've got a lot in store leading up to the release of Diablo III, including the launch of the Game Guide section featuring lore, characters, classes, maps, and more. Additionally, you’ll see us on the new Diablo III forums (http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/). We look forward to sharing and discussing all the latest Diablo III news, content, and updates with you for a long time to come.<br />
<br />
Blog comments, forum posting, and profile management are only available to those with an active StarCraft II, World of Warcraft, or Diablo III beta license.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, something interesting turned up on the DiabloFans forums (http://www.diablofans.com/topic/27504-wtf-open-beta/) today. When the site went live it seems that Blizzard also included features related to the open beta testing phase. Last time we heard from it, the beta was still supposed to be &quot;soon&quot;. <br />

Character Models Update<br />
We often see people request for model updates. This is something we'd definitely like to do at some point in time, but time is a very limited commodity for our art team. We also have to be very careful about what it means to &quot;update&quot; a model. We've made changes in the past to various characters and had some people be a bit upset that it was changed on them as they had made very specific choices about the look of their character. We try to be as sensitive as possible about these types of things.<br />
<br />
I can't give you more information than that, but the idea isn't far from our minds. We just have a lot of things we still want to on multiple levels that we hope enhance the experience of the game for everyone.<br />
<br />
There is a lot of new art that was introduced in Cataclysm along with upgrades in things such as water (as a very small example). We have some pretty high standards for ourselves as well and while we can always up the poly count, that only goes so far. We're talking about models that have existed since the beginning of the game and thus, aren't all as advanced as some of the newer models that have been introduced to the game. We've been upping more than the poly counts. We're doing more in the way of animation and the way models are articulated and move within the world. <br />
<br />
Now, as for hiring more people, we are always looking for talented people as you can see from our jobs page (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/directory.html#region=Americas).We're even currently looking for a 3D character artist (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/posting.html?id=0900036) among other things.<br />
<br />
Again, I think people are taking what I said to mean that there is a lack of desire on our end, and this is far from the truth. We absolutely agree that we could make improvements and would like to do so. It's just a matter of figuring out the &quot;when&quot; that this could be accomplished. There's a whole world (of warcraft) of things that are being worked on and we want to get to everything we can and make it count. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/193101/orcs-need-model-buffed) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3077927869?page=4#62))<br />

Raid Finder destroys communities<br />
With the current design philosophy of the upcoming Raid Finder, it's not at all intended to serve as a replacement for organized raiding. In fact, it isn't at all being designed to be used as a direct substitute for forming raids the way people do today. The goal is to give people who enjoy the more casual PuG raid environment, or just don't have the schedule to keep up with organized raids, a better way to experience raid content.<br />
<br />
We're still solidifying a lot of the details for this feature and look forward to sharing more with you soon. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/194251/raid-finder-destroys-communities) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3077867904?page=3#54))<br />

Blizz was pretty adamant about not wanting to do an old world remake right up until Cata was announced, even though they were obviously working on it for most of WotLK.<br />

Were does it say &quot;no we arent going to do new models?&quot; They have been hinting at it for a couple years now, and they dont reveal new feature until theres something to show.<br />

Hoping they stop with the new races and go ahead and use the remodeling of original models as an xpac feature. I think they will finally touch on this at this years Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

I can deal with them though, if they fix the female-orc-sitting-down-in-a-dress-gets-a-boner graphical error from classic. (For those not in the know: get a female orc in any robe, either in-game or in the model viewer, and sit using the x key. The robe texture bends awkwardly at the groin, making her look like she's pitching a tent - and trust me, after vigorous examination, I can safely say that penises are not standard for lady-type orcs, no matter what you might think about their appearance from the waist up). There's also the channeling animation broken and never fixed in the Wrath beta (the right arm of a female orc &quot;bounces&quot; when channeling ever since Wrath). Little minor graphical tweaks like that (such as troll females having eyelids BEHIND their eyes) would go a long way to helping the old models age more gracefully. They need a complete overhaul, sure, but I'd be happy with just the niggling problems and overlooked errors getting sorted first.<br />
<br />
Ohhhh and now I see they're hiring 3D character artists and get to spend a lovely evening of self-chastisement for stuffily insisting on the superiority of traditional concept art and turning my nose up at learning Maya or 3DS Max or even goddamn Poser when I had the chance.

Can't you just use the app in the iPad w/o it being optimized? A very small portion of people have iPads compared to iPhones and Androids and I'm sure they'd rather spend their time improving the app's features and squashing bugs then improving the graphics for the least popular device of the 3.</div></div><hr />

Yeah must admit I did roll my eyes too when they talked about time limitations. Seems to be with the way with Blizzard, every suggestion or wish seems so out of reach for them.. it's either too time consuming or their servers aren't good enough or yadda yadda and then you see a game like Rift do all those things and suddenly Blizzard can do cool things again. It's not like Blizzard are a small company still finding their feet and working on a shoestring budget.</div></div><hr />

Granted it was only a 3 week break but it could have been longer. The &quot;Looking for Raid&quot; tool is the start of what I have been wanting for awhile. I love raiding and everything that goes with it, but I dont have the time for it. Now I can possibly see some raids when I do have time and I dont have to follow my guilds schedule. For the people complaining about it, dont use it. Its that simple, you continue raiding with your guild and us casuals will use the tool. Nuff said.</div></div><hr />

We don't want to get stuck with a weird looking new model like Garrosh; big body with a small head. People asked for new tree-form and they got an over the top design very unappealing to most people even the casting animations are horrible. I would love new models as well but we have to be very careful what we wish for.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard and WoW, a game with like 9 million more players than Everquest probably had at the time has no excuse. I think the problem is they are using most of the revenue from WoW to build their other games.</div></div><hr />

The current models fit the art style perfectly, what are you expecting? Something out of Crysis 2 as your human female model? Also, why would you EVER want to change the moonkin models? They're perfect they way they are.<br />
<br />
I'd atleast want to have a human male that looks like Arthas, or a human female that looks like Jaina, or a male orc that looks like Thrall, or a male night elf that looks like Malfurion. It shouldn't be that hard to update our models with these</div></div><hr />

That shit will fuck the market, go away stupid shit! ):<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that it means that when you pick an item to sell, if you have this option enabled it will have your initial price be slightly lower or at the lowest price on the market. That is no different than all the in game AH addons today. I can't see it being setup so that it will automatically drop your buyout price if someone undercuts you. That would make no sense at all.</div></div><hr />
