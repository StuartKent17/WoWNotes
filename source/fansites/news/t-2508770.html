Having it in-game or from a Google window. Which to choose... Not to mention the addons literally guiding people as they quest, available for Classic and Live alike.<br />
<br />
You're free to either play Classic or not make use of the tools available if it's that important to you, although nothing can be done to erase knowledge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't the Shadowland leak, the good one say that 8.3 will come very shortly before next expansion because of the big changes to the story and world? If BfAs story as in War Campaign is done in 8.2.5, that could incline that there might be something to it. If the story in 8.3 really belong to the next expansion so to speak.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or there is just a &quot;thrilling&quot; end to it. Take your pick I guess.</div></div><hr />

Nazjatar sets up the story beyond the War Campaign for 8.3. It means a conclusion to the War Campaign, meanwhile BfA's got other storylines still ongoing.</div></div><hr />

I'll take it, means I'll look forward to 8.3 even more! Maybe we'll face Azeroth herself in 8.3, or the dark horse no one is talking about much, Magni Bronzebeard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
If 8.2.5 was the literal end of the expansion, it would've been marketed as the final patch. And if that had been the case, it would've been far more likely that they would've delayed 8.2 by a lot and have the features of 8.2.5 released with it rather than now, at which point they're following the release schedule of Legion. <br />
<br />
There will be an 8.3. And still, I bet we'll see this exact same void-of-logic-reasoning being thrown around for 9.0 and beyond too.</div></div><hr />

Too bad they lost me no more than a few months ago. To me personally, this expansion has been the worst yet. Warlords were bad, do not get me wrong, but I feel Warlords had more soul put into it than Battle for Azeroth has been given. The whole war campaign was excruciatingly lackluster, the loss of Master loot as a choice was a big strike at the freedom and sense of RPG in the game. The horrendous level of RNG surrounding gear in general has been horrendous. But the worst of all, has been the classes. I am so sad to see where the game has gone, Warlords at least had some decent characters and villains going on, and fun classes. Of course, Queen Azshara has been a long awaited villain for me to see and face, but even she feels gutted. It all just feels rushed, there's no build up anymore, no grey elements.<br />
<br />
You guys think the next expansion will get better? Wow has had its disappointing moments throughout the years, but after what's happened with the other franchises and the direction of WoW, do you think there will be changes I could look forward to? Cause it really doesn't feel like it anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, zero ideas ;D. Maybe beside one that 1) is most logical and obvious route after 8.2, 2)was hinted on last Blizzcon Argus style 3)was hinted in various 8.0, 8.1 and 8.1.5 content 4)hinted by Ion himself (about last cinematic) 5) &lt;mild spoiler&gt; hinted by one important NPC on 8.2.5 PTR 6)is most popular one in speculation discussion.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Just the raid&quot;?<br />

What raid would that be? Where would it be located? What would be the reason to go there if they don't add new outdoor content, quest content etc? They're setting up for facing the consequences of N'zoth being released in 8.2 at the end of the Nazjatar campaign, fyi. <br />

Not suspicious to me in the slightest, I'm quite clear on what it means.<br />
<br />
It means the War Campaign is ending in 8.2.5, 8.3's larger story is open for speculation based on what transpires in Nazjatar + anything that won't be resolved in 8.2.5, but it is happening and it won't have the War Campaign.<br />

Simple as.<br />

It's not weird in the slightest, the story was never going to be just the faction war? Players knew from the very reveal of the expansion that it'd be the same story as always where it starts with HvA war and ends with a big bad. <br />

We have a plot twist. You know BfA? The expansion Blizzard swore is gonna be about faction war and definitely not about Old Gods? Where we released the last Old God in 8.2? Turns out 8.2.5 Will end the war campaign. Go figure.</div></div><hr />

*shrug*, not gonna try to understand what &quot;pull their weight&quot; even means in this context, especially not after 8.2 is out for all to witness, as a fact. <br />
<br />
8.3 is happening, likely 8.3.5, and 8.3 being smaller than 8.2 is very unlikely.<br />

<br />
We have a plot twist. You know BfA? The expansion Blizzard swore is gonna be about faction war and definitely not about Old Gods? Where we released the last Old God in 8.2? Turns out 8.2.5 Will end the war campaign. Go figure.<br />
<br />
They never swore any such thing.<br />
It was an ironic meme perpetuated by the community for a reason. There were tons of hints to what'd go down from the start with tentacles, old god references, monsters, Azsharas Warbringer etc.<br />
<br />
Battle for Azeroth was a title of twofold meaning all the way. That's just how Blizzard writes faction war since they simply cannot commit fully to the concept.</div></div><hr />

<br />
N'zoth was all but confirmed at last Blizzcon when the fish representing him was on the final presentation slide (Argus the planet was teased this way for Legion) and 99.9% confirmed when the finale of Eternal Palace showed him go free after Ion told us we would know who the final boss is after that cutscene. <br />
<br />
I have no idea why there's any confusion here. The war's all but over already, Anduin and the Horde rebels will be friends against the eeeevil Sylvanas, she gets ousted in 8.2.5, 8.3 is N'zoth. This is clearly the only way the story can move forward, the two main plotlines of BfA have been the faction war and the Azerite/Old God stuff, they're not going to veer away into Shadowlands or Dragon Isles or anything like that in the final patch.</div></div><hr />

I think confusion comes from all the leaks supposedly involving N'zoth and the Black Empire being saved for next expansion. I guess Azshara will just be a sub-boss in the N'zoth raid.</div></div><hr />

Having it in-game or from a Google window. Which to choose... Not to mention the addons literally guiding people as they quest, available for Classic and Live alike.<br />
<br />
You're free to either play Classic or not make use of the tools available if it's that important to you, although nothing can be done to erase knowledge.<br />
<br />
Not sure if your mistype intentional or not but it says War Campaign conclusion, not Faction War conclusion. Though I do hope they finally put it to rest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I trust leaks about as far as I can throw them, especially overly detailed ones. The actual leaks we had for the past few expansions were avaricious on details, mostly stating the general ideas of the expansion (&quot;it's legion, level 110, class halls, artifacts, Demon Hunters&quot;). They didn't go into details regarding the final patch/raid and add a random picture of a cutscene. <br />
<br />
Azshara is probably saved for another expansion. Perhaps N'zoth rezzes her, transforms her further into a form she finds hideous which breaks her loyalty, she refuses to fight for him, and exits stage left to be a villain further down the line like Kel'thuzad was.</div></div><hr />

Well they better put something worth grinding for at the other end of that rep bar like a new allied race or something or I'm not doing it, the story is too shit to justify just wanting to conclude it as its own reward. I can watch the cut scene of Sylvanas' exile on Youtube.</div></div><hr />

4. Blizzard is lying and the war campaign will end in 8.3<br />

They had the whole &quot;Argus.&quot; thing at last Blizzcon like they did at the Blizzcon two years before with the &quot;The End?&quot; then put the N'Zoth fish up there pretty much telling us N'zoth time.</div></div><hr />

I dunno for some reason you all seem to forget the planet is dying, void lords trying to break through the sunwell, Nzoth was just freed, but yea that petty little squabble between 2 factions that dont even represent a 10th of Azeroths' sentient races surely means its all over.</div></div><hr />

Didn't the Shadowland leak, the good one say that 8.3 will come very shortly before next expansion because of the big changes to the story and world? If BfAs story as in War Campaign is done in 8.2.5, that could incline that there might be something to it. If the story in 8.3 really belong to the next expansion so to speak.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or there is just a &quot;thrilling&quot; end to it. Take your pick I guess.<br />
<br />
That leak also said the final raid .3 would be in Stormwind. If the war campaign is over in 8.2.5 seems unlikely 8.3 will focus on the Faction War at all</div></div><hr />

Probably they are ditching the war campaign questline to save money, time or effort for the 8.3. Besides probably the leaders spotlight is finished and they would want to focus back in the monster of the week formula or give some build up for the shadowlands/next expansion theme.</div></div><hr />

Yes, most of the content were about the war.

How was BFA NOT an actual faction conflict expansion? It started off with teldrassil and under city. We went to zandalar/broken isles to further our faction conflict. The war campaign was the faction conflict. The world quests involved faction conflict with sabotage and invasions. The BoD raid was faction conflict.

<br />
I want you to think back and look at mists of pandaria where overall the feel to it was dealing with the shah and then the thunder game and then right there at the end it was the faction conflict now I want you to think of the current expansion so the first few things that we've had to do were faction conflict like that's been the uniting story that's been the great Arc but none of the zones were really about the faction conflict at least from the alliance side we had one's own about the drust another about the Naga and old God and the third zone was kind of a mix but it was more about an internal conflict in the actual faction conflict<br />
<br />
And then we move on to yes the war campaign was about the faction conflict but really other than that in a few throw away quests in stormsong there wasn't really much to go on story-wise we did have one raid based around the conflict but we have had every other raid about something else<br />

<br />
No I'm not actually if you look at the grand theme of the expansion yeah it's about a faction war but if you look at it the faction conflict has just been kind of linear yeah they added invasions and you have some World quests about it but you have just as many about dealing with old gods turtles and Naga<br />
<br />
Think back to mists of pandaria that had just an overarching story of like discovering pandaria discovering the shop and stuff like that while we're on the way back not really brought forward until the end of the expansion was the fact that this entire time the warchief was going nucking futs and it ended on that<br />
<br />
I mean you take out the war campaign and you have maybe seven or eight different possibilities for a main theme just by leveling<br />
<br />
I'm actually really pissed because from the alliance perspective we have no idea why we went into the first raid and again it's just thinking about this expansion as a faction war is like thinking about it as a PVP expansion yeah sure it's there and it shoved in your face but how important to everything really was it</div></div><hr />

I think they're releasing 8.2.5 as a final patch for BFA, and they will move onto 9.0 in order to make up for lost time &quot;earlier&quot; than usual possibly pushing it for a december/january release date in order to make up for BFA.<br />
<br />
8.3 is possible but if one had to wait for 8.3 till january and people assume classic alone is gonna keep the ship sailing they are wrong, classic will die out within the next 2 months when people realize theres nothing to do they cant already do in retail.<br />
<br />
Classic is a superficial bandaid to a bigger problem, they need to start releasing more frequent patches and stop caring if raiders need 77 days to get content done or not and just &quot;make content&quot; for other people, not just the raiding community.<br />
<br />
I for one, would be fine with an &quot;entire&quot; patch with no new raid tier, a 4 hour long story with lots more voice acting/char development and a few mogs, maybe 1 new dungeon.<br />
<br />
Episodic patches would be more interesting anyway, they'd make the game feel more alive and ongoing rather than &quot;Everything is tied to the raid so we cant continue until the next raid is being made&quot; infact, get rid of raiding/story association completley and make raiding its own thing, you'd benefit the game immensiely since the devs would be able to make raids side content rather than main content, giving them more development into the games story/lore and thus more persistant patches.<br />
<br />
I for one would be fine having 9.9 before moving into 10.0 if it meant that all the patches had some depth and purpose to them, not just a raiding patch.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
You could have 9.1 and 9.1.5 focus on a single raid in 9.1 followed by a QoL addition in 9.1.5 such as a new allied race, then 9.2 and 9.3 could be story related, releasing in intervals between the next patch, 9.4 could be a new raid, 9.4.5 being a new QoL feature, then 9.5 9.6 being more story agian and 9.7+9.7.5 being another raid, with 9.8 and 9.9 being patches designed to bridge the gaps between this expansion and the next.</div></div><hr />

Okay I'll be optimistic for a second here. &quot;Lead the charge in the thrilling conclusion to the War Campaign.&quot; so I'm guessing it'll be a Warfront or city assault related event then with that specific wording and it doesn't say it's the end of the Faction War so that might be stretched out for 8.3 or they could be aiming to use Azshara or Nzoth in some way in that patch but it remains to be seen. Alternatively, this could be their WoD approach to ending the Faction War, Campaign and the expansion in one story beat and will be aiming for all the other plot threads to be used in 9.0 and the next expansion e.g. end Magni's Azerite farm and start the old god boogaloo in the Wake of Shadows or whatever expansion.</div></div><hr />

Considering you can get to exalted by doing the war campaign and heroic island expeditions every week, not having rep with 7th Legion this late in the expansion just means you haven't been playing the game.</div></div><hr />

I got Exalted with 7th Legion like 6 months ago after casual play. I don't see what the big deal is.</div></div><hr />

Are you just realizing they gate story’s to rep now? Your kinda late to the party by a lot of expans.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kallisto</div><div class="date">2019-09-14, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just think they already moved on. No war story in 8.3 is wierd at least.<br />
<br />
War was the small part of bfa. The big part has always been the South seas/old god part of it with naga, N'zoth and his sea faring followers. 8.3 is likely nyalotha as hinted at last years blizzcon in the same way they did the whole argus reveal 2 years earlier at the same event for legion.<br />
<br />
As for moving on. Story wise bfa was completed in blizzard before we were running away from the legion on the broken shore. They certainly have next expansion and the one after it story all done. <br />
<br />
Remember metzen retired during first weeks of legion, he also stated he never went into work in the months building up to that. With one of the last things he was shown was the Cinematic of Anduin leading the Alliance leaders to confront sylvanas in Lordaeron throne room. <br />
<br />
This was 3.5 years ago. So of course they moved on. Narritiveky they're likely wrapping up patch 10.3 on the story side.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Accendor</div><div class="date">2019-09-14, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say the N'zoth storyline is far more relevant to me than the same old faction crap.<br />
<br />
How can that be? After Teldrassil one faction has to go extinct, the same is not necessarily true for the rise of N'Zoth (which is in theory a pretty cool storyline, but thrown in at the wrong time)<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Think back to mists of pandaria that had just an overarching story of like discovering pandaria discovering the shop and stuff like that while we're on the way back not really brought forward until the end of the expansion was the fact that this entire time the warchief was going nucking futs and it ended on that<br />
<br />
I mean you take out the war campaign and you have maybe seven or eight different possibilities for a main theme just by leveling<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is that Garrosh &quot;just&quot; threw an atomic bomb on one city (and this was done by a very small faction of secret agents and units), while Sylvanas rallied the whole horde behind her who willingly committed genocide.<br />
So while I agree with you that there are more possible themes for the expansion, I think the fight for extinction is the most important one. Even more important than the fight against N'Zoth, because his main goal is to enslave all living creatures while the hordes main goal is to kill all alliance and possible all living creatures in the end. Not really seeing how any threat could be bigger than that.</div></div><hr />

the antithesis to classic wow<br />
why dont they play the game for us while they are at it<br />
<br />
I hope you don't use Questie, Azeroth Auto Pilot, Wowhead, or any other addon or site that will tell you where to find objectives. Make sure you keep the experience &quot;pure.&quot; Never mind the fact that most vanilla players used Thottbot to look up every quest and they were thrilled when the map was changed to show us where things were so we didn't have to alt tab to do that anymore.<br />

This is the same lying bullshit as playing morrowind with no mods and crashing at every levitate.<br />
Stop being asinine, Classic is 1.12 not 1.Full of bugs, unplayable classes and crashes 1.</div></div><hr />
