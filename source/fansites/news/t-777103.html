BlizzCon 2010 Begins This Week<br />
BlizzCon is indeed this week and you can expect a full coverage of the event on MMO-Champion!<br />
Are you ready for BlizzCon 2010? Blizzard Entertainment's two-day gaming festival begins this Friday, October 22, at the Anaheim Convention Center. The sold-out show features developer discussion panels, top-tier tournament competition, the popular costume and dance contests hosted by Jay Mohr, an epic closing concert starring Tenacious D, and much more.<br />
<br />
You can still join us from home by purchasing a BlizzCon Virtual Ticket (http://blizzcon.rayv.com), featuring more than 50 hours of live HD coverage as well as the exclusive BlizzCon 2010 World of Warcraft pet and StarCraft II in-game items. The Virtual Ticket is available globally via Internet stream and also through DIRECTV in the U.S. For more information, read our recent press release (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/news/?d=2010-10#180800) or visit BlizzCon.com (http://blizzcon.com). <br />
<br />
<br />
Beta Raid Testing Schedule for Oct. 19<br />
Yet more raid testing!<br />
<br />
There will be two sessions, an EU session starting at 11AM server time (PDT), and a US timed session at 4PM server time (PDT). We'll open the zones on all Beta realms (including KR!) for both sessions, and possibly longer.<br />
<br />
The following encounters will be tested:<br />
<br />
Maloriak in Blackwing Descent<br />
Atramedes in Blackwing Descent<br />
<br />
Blackwing Descent is a raid zone with an entrance located along the side of Blackrock Mountain.<br />
<br />
Since these are the beta realms, this schedule is subject to change at a moment's notice due to bugs and server issues. More raid tests will be occurring over the next few weeks. <br />
<br />
<br />
Class balance as of Oct 18, 2010<br />
We are going to take the resilience buff down a little.<br />
<br />
It should end up as a 25% buff from where it stood originally, not a 50% buff. For point of comparison, maxing out resilience before our first hotfix reduced damage by ~50%. After out hotfix, the damage reduction with max resilience was 80%. With this most recent change, damage reduction with max resilience will go down to 60%.<br />
<br />
Part of what is going on here is that we don't want newly leveled characters to explode in PvP, while still making sure that well-geared characters aren't invulnerable. The current resilience curve makes that a tricky thing to balance. Perhaps in the future resilience needs diminishing returns so that it doesn't keep getting better and better the more you have.<br />
<br />
While we don't have any additional announcements to make at this time, there are some additional balance tweaks we're working on. Some of our adjustments at level 80 ended up causing certain classes to be overpowered or underpowered at level 85. <br />
<br />
<br />

Holy Paladins on Beta<br />
After looking at more of the raid attempts on beta, we are worried that Holy paladins are doing too much area healing and not enough single target healing.<br />
<br />
While we definitely want to scoot paladins away from their Lich King monopoly on tank healing and towards raid healing, we don't want to go too far. We're thinking about nerfing Holy Radiance and buffing single target healing. Again, the goal is not that Holy paladins only ever heal the tank, but we want them to actually be able to heal the tank as well.<br />
<br />
On Holy Radiance, we think the 20 yard range shifted the spell from one where position was relevant to just blowing it on cooldown. We'll probably keep the 20 yard radius, but have a falloff to where the healing is highest within 8-10 yards of the paladin. This will also help the spell stay relevant in 5-player dungeons without being overpowered in larger raids. The cap for Holy Radiance (and Healing Rain for that matter) also aren't working correctly at the moment.<br />
<br />
If we decide to buff single target healing, it would probably just be points on the 5 direct heals. We think Beacon is in a good place and aren't looking to overhaul the overall Holy mechanics. It's just a numbers issue.<br />
<br />
Judging Seal of Insight (a change I alluded to earlier) will help with mana problems, especially when Divine Plea is on cooldown or you're nervous about using it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27292693370/holy-paladins-compilation-of-problems-4-01/))<br />
<br />
Beacon of Light Nerf<br />
We thought Beacon was overpowered when the paladin could literally heal two targets to 100% at once. In that era, there was never a reason to heal the Beaconed target. Not only was it powerful, it was really easy and required little action or decision on the part of the paladin. Having the Beacon splash some healing onto a target who may or may not need it feels balance-able to us. It means the paladin still needs to decide when to heal the Beaconed target indirectly (i.e. use Beacon) or when to heal them directly. It means there is the risk of doing the wrong thing, which could mean switching Beacon when you shouldn't have or healing the Beacon when you should have healed someone else.

needed an important clarification there.<br />

Before the nerf it was... what? Meleeing for 1,000 damage a swing? When everything has 100k HP pools? <br />

<br />
Hi, you must be new here. Chairs are over there, refreshments are served promptly on the hour every two hours.<br />
<br />
Enhancement shamans have been &quot;making do&quot; with their class adjustments/nerfs for what? Three expansions now. We're blissfully mediocre DPS until something comes along that makes us explode in PURE DPS AWESUM (Feral Spirits, LvB on MW, changes to WF/FT that make logical sense, etc), then Blizzard goes &quot;whoa whoa whoa whoa, dial that back, there, kiddos&quot;, and we're brought back in line. It's just the way of the shaman class, really. We're the only hybrid out there that really follows the &quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot; line Blizzard was following with their so-called &quot;hybrid tax&quot;. Then again, we're more a halfassed hybrid like Warriors or DKs.<br />
<br />
Really though, the best thing any shaman (especially Enhancement) can do is hold on to their yarmulke and wait for that gentle *woosh* of air that is being passed over. Hell, we're lucky we got anything other than a new Stormstrike icon. ...although, I guess the strange lightning bolt graphic thinger for the Power Auras counts ... fml.</div></div><hr />

Note that those are the minimum requirements to get the game to play on your machine. That implies that your graphics are pretty much set to Low, with only the bare minimum of effects turned on to see fire on the ground.<br />
<br />
If you want to play the game at maximum potential, you need to invest in a DX11-supporting video card, among other things. Your best bet would be to ask in a forum for computer building/modding to get the general idea of what you need to do to get your machine amped up.<br />

No, it was just extremely good at level 85.<br />

They're not reverting the nerfs at 80, this is strictly aimed at 85 (BETA). I guess some people only tend to see what they want to see, though.</div></div><hr />

Yo smartass, here's the quote from Blizzards system requirements. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Recommended Specifications<br />

Why aren't you nerfing Vengeance to the ground - That is probably one of the most OP &quot;abilities&quot; atm.

If you knew anything about the mage class rather than just randomly QQing you'd understand what this is about.<br />
<br />
Mages at level 80 were overpowered. With current combat ratings they were simply too powerful. Even post nerf mages are still powerful.<br />
<br />
However, they also applied the nerf to beta were mages have much lower combat ratings. Doing so meant in the recent raid tests mages were coming in bottom of the meters. All the aspects that make mages overpowered at 80 don't exist at 85 and this change undoes the beta nerf that shouldn't have happened in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is monitoring mostly the level 85's, in and outside of the new raids, so it's possible that mages don't scale as well as some of the other classes as they level. If you remember from a few news posts back, Boub said that the recent class changes on live were likely not how Blizzard wants to work those classes at 85. I may be wrong- just an educated guess.</div></div><hr />

Says you. This is not typically what &quot;minimum requirements&quot; means from any software vendor. Typically this means the bare minimum specs required to have the software running at all.<br />

Even recommended settings are minimum recommended settings - i.e., your definition of &quot;minimum requirements.&quot;</div></div><hr />

No that's not what is going on. Mages were overpowered with their talents at 80. So they nerfed that. That nerf went into a Beta build. Mages weren't performing as they intended at 85 in the beta so they are putting the numbers back to 25% (Live remains unchanged). Odds are those numbers will change slightly but it should put mages in line with other classes at level 85.</div></div><hr />

What makes mages, especially fire, broken currently is the fact that we can get above 70% crit and 30% haste, plain and simple.

<br />
Because it was a temporary nerf for 80... not 85. For some reason, they applied it to Beta as well (probably just to see where scaling lies) and Blizzard obviously got half a clue and realized it was absolutely unnecessary at 85. In fact, it completely destroyed us.<br />
<br />
Yes we were imbalanced at 80, so most of us understand why the temporary nerf was applied, but not at 85. People are so quick to whine about Mages, and you don't even understand why we were nerfed. We are only overpowered at 80. I'm really glad Blizzard is fixing this *now* rather than making us wait once we all hit 85 and are doing relevant content.<br />
<br />
<br />
What makes mages, especially fire, broken currently is the fact that we can get above 70% crit and 30% haste, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
As much as this guy irritates me, he's right. We are only overpowered at 80 because our talents and coefficients were not built with such high stat ratings in mind. At 85 they effectively get cut in half (if not more), and it balances us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since this change happened before raiding tests... they have reverted then to original numbers and will probably watch them closely int he raid tests.. ti should bring us back in line (or at least closer) to that of the other DPS classes/specs. Heck they may even have to BUFF su some more on Beta.. as the Locks, boomkins, Hunters, Warriors, Ret Palis, etc are doing 14-15k.. where we were hard pressed to push 9-10k...<br />
<br />
How they will handle the disparrage between Live and Beta? Who knows... perhaps they will throw thier hands up and say.. it's only 6 weeks... and patch it back now on Live... OR magically when Cataclysm pops.. we will have the changes back. Either way is fine with me.. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The mage nerfs were for LEVEL 80, not level 85. At level 85 these nerfs put mages at the bottom of the damage meters. This is why you see the build that removes the nerf as a BETA BUILD, and not a PTR build. There is a difference. <br />
<br />
Hunters, you are currently topping the raid charts in Cataclysm. Good hunters are still able to pull 10k dps in 25 ICC. This may not be the 12k+ that you were used to before the patch, but it is plenty to clear it. If you can't wait 7 weeks for the new expansion to release so you can top the charts, maybe you should stop playing for a while.<br />

<br />
we are not talking about the enchants that come for bows and guns, we are talking about the weapon enchants. they took away the proc based enchants for 1h weapons and added a new 2h weapon enchant. that makes it look like blizzard wants hunters to only use 2h weapons.<br />
<br />
i'm guessing one of two things, its too hard to balance two hunter weapons, both with a proc chance that goes off with ranged (melee proc would be based on the weapon that actually hits OH proc/MH Proc). or they just want to see how the new enchant stacks up and test it in beta, making all hunters choose a 2h weapon and test it out.</div></div><hr />

Nah the only retards are the paladins thinking that they deserve their bi-daily book on their class, and how &quot;broken&quot; and &quot;inferior&quot; they are when they do amazing damage, and healing. O and last I heard they were pretty good tanks too, unlike, say, bears who still only have three buttons to push.</div></div><hr />

So, how does your foot taste there GC. You post you think they are fine, then just 1 day latter you guys start getting actual numbers instead of your own inflated egos telling you the truth. <br />

Wonder how many more numbers you people will have to see before you start admitting you were wrong about many things.</div></div><hr />

so much for all of the &quot;if your machine can run WoW now, then it will be able to run Cataclysm&quot; talk. If i'm going to have to spend $600 to $800 to build a new machine to play this game (finding old FX cards is not an option. no reputable dealers still sell working FX, 6 series, of 7 series APG cards) then i would rather save the money i would spend on this overplayed game, and wait for something new like swtor.<br />
<br />
it would have been nice if they let us know more than a month and a half in advance that we would have to build new machines in order to play. at least then i could have spent time searching for a working non crap built FX, or 6 series card.</div></div><hr />

But the holy nova nerf... wtf is the point of first making it really useful in raid-environment, and then gimping it down again... /facedesk<br />

Maybe they noticed mages doing tank like damage in the beta raids???</div></div><hr />

Holy Paladins in Beta are ridiculously OP in 25 mans due to their AoE healing capability. Have you seen PoV's of Holy Paladins in 25 mans with recount?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Specifically, we increased the damage of the signature abilities (Chimera Shot, Explosive Shot and Kill Command) by 15-25%. This will both improve overall damage-dealing and make sure that these abilities are prioritized higher than other shots. We think this will bring hunters to a good enough state until they hit 85. Aspect of the Fox and Cobra Shot solve some specific issues at higher levels. Marksman hunters may still trump Survival and Beastmaster hunters until they’re 85, since their rotations rely a little on Cobra Shot.</div></div><hr />

I need an advice because i meet all requirements but i was kinda sure to have to upgrade my ram to 4 gb!!!! Suggestion needed guys!! ;)<br />
<br />
It's not.. Recommended is about &quot;Medium&quot; settings actually.<br />
Personally experiencing low frame rate (15-20) on ultra with x9100 4gb ddr3 GF 9800 GT. However if shadows are turned off, FPS jumps from 20 to 60 instantly event in City / raid. Looks like shadows rendering is buggy.</div></div><hr />

9800GT is ur problem. 2008 card. Maybe lower settings. Then again, whats ur HDD and CPU?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Year not so important. It just mean that cheap 2010' GF GTS 360 would perform as 2007' hi-end video card. Anyway G9800GT is in Class1 at Notebookcheck and similar ratings. And GTA4, Civ5 running smooth at highest settings and Crysis in medium.<br />
CPU as stated above is x9100, more info: http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=35431<br />
As for HDD (isn't it only for loading? swamp should not be used then game takes only 600-800 MB of RAM) it's RAID0/1 2x7200 rpm sata drives.<br />
<br />
That's why I assume shadows rendering is buggy !</div></div><hr />

I just asked for a link to one of the videos. I would very much like to see one from a holy pov. Healer vids are the best in my opinion. You get to see much more of what's going on. THEY don't, they are too busy having to watch little bars.</div></div><hr />
