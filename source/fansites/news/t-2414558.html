They HAVE to spend on marketing. When the budget out a game a certain percentage of that budget is earmarked for marketing, its so they can get approved by the big wigs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no affection for the Ally... but maybe because in Vanilla I was a troll and I've change faction at the end of WotLK, just to stay with a group of friends... so most of my memorys are related more to the Horde than the Alliance, and I feel like an alien among them, that why I am a space goat. <br />
<br />
Also, at this point mostly of us got characters from both side and expecially now, with all this new allied races, you are encouraged to play both side.<br />
<br />
So, isn't quite a contradiction to rally us for a faction, when at the same time we are moved to play both to collect all the Factions exclusive items, unlock all the race?</div></div><hr />

&quot;Think of someone you absolutely don't want to sit next to in the bus, what would he or she look like?&quot;<br />

I mean, I'm biased because I don't like the whole alliance vs. horde shtick, I always had most fun in Legion/Scourge stories and I really wish this was another world-ending expansion threat with Azshara being this overwhelming force of nature rather than just another war.<br />
<br />
But to stay on topic, they're cringe-worthy at least to me. The word I'd describe it is corny, and it trivializes and makes nerds look 2-dimensional, a lot like The Big Bang Theory. Yeah, ok, like I'm going to sit next to some huge tattoo guy instead of the girl on the bus because of a game. lol I know it's meant to be corny and funny, but... it's just not funny, not to me, anyway. That's just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But to stay on topic, they're cringe-worthy at least to me. The word I'd describe it is corny, and it trivializes and makes nerds look 2-dimensional, a lot like The Big Bang Theory. Yeah, ok, like I'm going to sit next to some huge tattoo guy instead of the girl on the bus because of a game. lol I know it's meant to be corny and funny, but... it's just not funny, not to me, anyway. That's just my opinion.<br />
<br />
A single add - sure. But all 4 adds cover a variety of different types of nerds.<br />
The girl chooses to get wet over the shelter of the umbrella<br />
The guy chooses minimal personal space over having personal space<br />
The kid chooses his dads big toy over his mums little toy<br />
<br />
It sounds to me like you overinflated the whole guy meets girl scenario which probably comes from your personal experience and view on relationships. <br />
<br />
All of them are cool - they are who they are. Horde v Alliance IS Warcraft<br />

So you're saying you'd sit next to the tattooed guy over a girl because of game faction bias? lol The baby one was ok, but been done. The umbrella one and elevator ones I'm indifferent to, they weren't funny either, just meh. The only one that's different is the baby, the other 3 still paint nerds as 2-dimensional who would do socially awkward things due to their love for games, like getting wet in the rain, finding one self in an undesirable situation or acting oddly in an elevator. <br />
<br />
They might as well have had an ad where a guy blowing off a date due to raid night. Which probably has happened but never should have unless the date was going to be unpleasant AF.</div></div><hr />

They were spot-on on the dad though. Most older males from my poll picked humans and a couple dwarves/orcs.<br />

You did not just compare a fictitious game faction war with sports team rivalries. lol Sports team rivalries are real. Horde vs. Alliance is... not?

So Horde are fat and homosexual and Alliance are cute girls. Accurate commercials.<br />

Keep grasping at those straws in an attempt to turn something into sexuality/sex/weight<br />

Making commercials themed around the upcoming Horde v Alliance theme is &quot;desperate&quot;.<br />
<br />
Uhm sure whatever you say.<br />
<br />
And judging by EAs latest projects this is how Anthem is gonna go. Gain steam and ground at first then flop back down. Look at what that company did to Battlefront or Mass Effect for example. And you want to trust them with a full multiplayer experience?</div></div><hr />

I think for some, at least for me and a few I know, the last commercials we remember was Cata, I think, where it was something like &quot;12 million people can't be wrong&quot; and then they tanked... hard and started hemorrhaging players and mysteriously when they stopped giving out sub numbers because the &quot;focus is on all Blizzard games, not just Warcraft&quot;. Now that Warcraft is &quot;important enough&quot; it kind of smells desperate. No, I'm not saying &quot;WoW is dying&quot; but everyone has to be able to admit it's no longer in its prime.<br />
<br />
Related: As a whole, I'm loyal to winning. Whatever faction. As a person, FOR THE ALLIANCE.<br />
<br />
Maybe one day I'll realm change off Ghostlands onto a real server with a reasonable population and guild count so I can find a M+ guild... but right now I'm too lazy for that. I've been too lazy for like ... some number of years.</div></div><hr />

I mean these are clearly targeted at the returning player audience. No one who hasn't already played WoW will see these and understand the strength of the message.<br />
<br />
But someone who is a former player may see this and get nostalgic for the old faction pride. That's the obvious target here.</div></div><hr />

Those commercials look like they were rushed in a 30 minute meeting, really bad for such a big company.<br />
<br />
30 minutes with 2 guys comin 7mins too late, 10 mins of small talk and drinking coffee, and everybody leaves 5mins before descission making and fixing, which happens on the way to the toilette, while washing hands. lunch, after that.</div></div><hr />

It's funny, cause the adds suggest that there is such a thing as an &quot;alliance fanboi&quot;. (forums not included)<br />
<br />
Its even more funny, cause in every case the girl was alliance.<br />
<br />
Where in my self-made poll over the years (mostly done in RL, Vanilla-to-Cata era, close to 300 perticipants) the vast majority of females picked female blood elf, with a few exceptions.<br />
They were spot-on on the dad though. Most older males from my poll picked humans and a couple dwarves/orcs.<br />
The child picked alliance (or rather, the biggest toy). Where in my poll, the vast majority of children and preteens (9-16) picked undead with a few exceptions.<br />
<br />
Uhhh no the girl was not alliance in all the commercials. <br />
Elevator 2 dudes<br />
Bus alliance girl horde boy<br />
Rain alliance girl horde boy<br />
Kids choose HORDE MOTHER alliance father.<br />

Blizzard makes commercials, they have &quot;never&quot; made commercials before, wow is money grab!<br />
also i love how you go &quot;Blizz is money grab&quot; then right after &quot;I am waiting for anthem&quot; do you fucking remember their &quot;totally real people playing the game and voice chatting&quot; bullshit? yeah super not money grabbing.</div></div><hr />
