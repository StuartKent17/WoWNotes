<br />
Patch 6.2 - Darker Nights<br />
Warlords of Draenor added darker nights (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s-DtaiZIno) in a few areas and Patch 6.2 will expand upon that by darkening most of the northern half of Kalimdor. <br />
<br />

Hellbreach Normal Testing<br />
We've opened up Normal Hellfire Citadel, and will keep it open for the next couple of days. The only bosses currently enabled are Hellfire Assault, Iron Reaver, and Kormrok. Please use this thread to provide feedback, bug reports, and otherwise discuss the encounters. Logs are very helpful, and please, when offering feedback, specify the nature of your group: Group Finder PUG, full guild group with Heroic/Mythic/etc. experience, partial premade, etc. Ultimately, bear in mind that this is Normal mode, and the audience is Friends/Family groups and pickup groups - a core question would be whether you'd feel comfortable joining a Premade Group via Group Finder to complete these encounters. Thanks!<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Why is 6.1 known as the selfie patch among the community then?<br />
There wasn't a lot of content in 6.1 &amp; players, understandably upset, used that label as criticism. (CM_Zarhym (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/605893695586467842))<br />
<br />
Only an hour for the chat Saturday? Doesn't seem long enough, will there be some type of followup?<br />
We'll be setting up some fansite interviews where we expect follow-up questions will be collected &amp; asked. (CM_Zarhym (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/605895803173879808))<br />
<br />
The devs you ADDED, and the amount of content produced is why resources are misallocated. Excuses dont help<br />
You don't know that. You can give feedback about the game w/o inventing reasons why the game is as it is. (CM_Zarhym (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/605897747825238017))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Any chance to make pets semi transparent like in Diablo 3? Sometimes its really difficult to see whats under the boss...<br />
We're exploring solutions to the visual clutter caused by pets and guardians and their impact on melee players. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/603657151412830210))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Ashran is a bit of a stretch in this regard. Told it was a Modern AV, when it's nothing like it at all.<br />
.What would you change? What about AV do you miss? Sorry if I'm always asking these Q's, I'm curious! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/603438605340647424))<br />
<br />
Reputations<br />
Do you think cata faction rep grinds for gear were good or bad? I know apexis dailies simplify, but factions felt more roleplay-ey<br />
I liked faction-specific reps with different, unfolding dailies that told a specific story to that faction. Unsure on rewards. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/603384257130713088))<br />
<br />
Flying<br />
I think I'm in a minority though. I feel these days the majority always prefers the path of least resistance.<br />
I dunno, I feel like getting flying, especially full speed, back in TBC felt like a huge hurdle and felt awesome once you got it. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/603420456297877504))<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
Both extremes of &quot;hours of daily quests every day&quot; to &quot;no daily quests ever&quot; are bad.<br />
Agree! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/603392668442427392))<br />
<br />
If the MoP style dailies didn’t have progression gear tied to them, it should have been fine.<br />
I dunno, personally having some power rewards is nice, having shortcuts to them is nice too. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/603392607004286977))<br />
Wasn’t MoP when the daily limit was lifted? People suddenly binged on dailies.<br />
Yep, so doing 50 felt mandatory, which removed all choice you had in what you did for 3 hours. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/603392875188133890))<br />
Timeless Isle didn't have enough draw after the first month due to lack of story-driven dailies.<br />
Also agree, layering 5.1 over it with the size and uniqueness of IoT would have been cool. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/603393342475522048))<br />
Which seems like such an obvious design decision that it's perplexing this didn't happen in the first place.<br />
Development is a complex and peculiar beast, with many heads, and some breathe fire. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/603426178154819584))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Developer Communication<br />
what if the &quot;bold&quot; decisions come off as lazy with the reasons that are being given?<br />
It generally isn't worth lying to players. They will figure out the truth. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602924485549936642))<br />
If something is too much work given the benefit, they'd likely just say that. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602924578315186176))<br />
So my advice is to argue based on the reasons stated, not try to make up or guess at reasons and argue those. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602924722200838144))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
I think we (meaning I) went too far in removing what was unique about some classes. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602919258616561664))<br />
What made you guys start homogenizing? Just easier to balance?<br />
And it came largely from trying to address player concerns about balance or utility. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/603265936863277056))<br />
Barring those concerns, would homogenization have ever taken place to the degree it did, or eventually a future necessity?<br />
I don't think it was a foregone conclusion. These things are all trade offs. What do you value more? Identity or utility? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/603354330138169344))<br />
<br />
Do you think Cata / MoP / WoD took bring the player, not the class too far? As Ret I now feel more like a DPS than a paladin.<br />
I feel like we gave players what they asked for: near parity in all encounters, which made then happy short term. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602925020134813696))<br />
But long term it's possible those decisions (mine) erode depth in the long term. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602925243498246144))<br />
But had we gone the less homogenized route, there would have been a lot more &quot;my dude sucks on burst AE fights&quot; etc. posts. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602919419853996032))<br />
u still see those posts now and I hear a lot of talk from blizzard that they like Class Niche<br />
Many decisions devs make may seem weird in the short term but pay huge dividends eventually, (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602925432468418560))<br />
dividends is a strange term in this context. Are you still thinking from a player POV or dev?<br />
Short term, a player may say: I hate that feature. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602928477910605825))<br />
Long term, they may say: I don't know why, but I just lost interest in the game. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602928598756904960))<br />
Devs generally worry more about that second case. The risks there are probably greater. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602928707078987776))<br />
So they may make a change that is unpopular in the short term to keep the game healthy in the long run. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602928925761634304))<br />
is indecisiveness a real thing on big dev teams? Have teams been very split and much conflicted on design?<br />
I haven't seen that much indecision in my time. I have seen a ton of disagreement though. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602997302098206721))<br />
Game development, where I have been, requires a lot of discussion. People burn out on the debate culture. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602997640758894593))<br />
It's just so subjective. Should we fix a bug that affects 0.1% of players? Is that animation good enough? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602997828730793984))<br />

Apparently. What's even funny about it is that the current night-time Thunderbluff is better than the 6.2 change.<br />
<br />
How can Blizzard think that slapping a mostly-pink effect visual on the area actually makes it dark?</div></div><hr />

9 comments in and the split in opinions is already obvious and sad.<br />
<br />
Tuning darker colours in a couple of zones takes very little work and is something quite a lot of people have been requesting for a long time. Stop complaining that they skipped 3 raid tiers and 2 daily hubs for it.</div></div><hr />

You don't know that. You can give feedback about the game w/o inventing reasons why the game is as it is. (CM_Zarhym)<br />

People want answers but they are not giving any so they are &quot;inventing&quot; the answers themselves. Muffinus answer is funny (fire breathing three headed beast analogy) but it doesn't give me any hope of things getting any better. He basically just says it's hard... Oke...

They changed how lighting worked a couple of expansions ago, which had the consequence of changing how the zones looked during the night. It has not been a high priority issue, which is why it's taken so long to fix.</div></div><hr />

His answers are giving more of an idea of what might be going on, and it's interesting, especially him talking about the 'argument culture&quot; there, and admitting outright he went to far homogenizing the classes. I'd rather have his posts, then the &quot;Oh, look, Zarhym is being an asshole again&quot; posts. <br />
<br />
And, for a &quot;random dude&quot;, his resume is a hell of a lot more impressive as a game designer than yours.<br />

He hasn't been on the team for what...over a year? Two? now. I understand that it's tempting when he's willing to chat and other devs, relatively, are not; however, he isn't really tapped in to the current dynamic of the team, or the politics of Acti-Blizz, anymore.<br />
<br />
Heck, he's even said he hasn't played WoW for some time. Needed a break, wanted to play other games, and you know, he devs another game now...<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
Much of his opinions and such were very similar.<br />
<br />
Really, the difference I see between Ghostcrawler's correspondences and the current CMs/Devs is that he put a lot of thought into his writing--how he said things, etc. He didn't use Twitter extensively then, which was good (Twitter is too short, everything comes off as sarcastic or one-liner). His posts and blogs were a lot more respectful of players--even when he was saying things like, &quot;Yeah, dungeons SHOULD be hard!&quot; I didn't always agree with him but I never felt patronized or disrespected by him.<br />
<br />
The current team? Patronizing and inflammatory at best, typically.*** They could stand to take a Creative Writing 101 course. It reminds me of a statement that a dev from Fallout said once when he was visiting to give a presentation on writing in games. &quot;Most game developers, in my experience, are not writers. They're not good at communicating through writing, and they're not good at knowing the themes and structures of narratives. That's why you get sub-par or hackneyed plots in video games. They don't have a basis of skill in that regard--and that's fine, that's not what their expertise is. But as games get more complex from &quot;jump on goombas, get the flag,&quot; we need writers on devteams more than ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
***Edit: Muffinus would be the one example that stands out as somebody who doesn't fit this. Muffi does a good job of trying to elicit better, more useful feedback from players without speaking down to them. The way Muffi confronts the issues on the forum strikes me as a lone warrior staying behind to fight off the hordes so the rest can slink back to safety...heh</div></div><hr />

Totally agree. That's what leaped out at me too. Darker nights are cool, but those lighting changes are just gross. Mulgore and the Barrens were beautiful at night, and this makes them look like really unpleasant places to be. Hopefully these changes aren't final.</div></div><hr />

I used to think Ghostcrawlers answers were curt and rude, but Zarhym needs to be muffled by Blizzard. He has to have one of the most condescending tones I have ever read online, and there are soooo many trolls in the game and on forums.

Wonder if Blizzard's doing a pass on all zones a few per patch and darkening them so just happened to be doing Kalimdor at the moment or if they just randomly chose to do the ones Chaud posted. While I don't want ultra dark nights, the nights aren't really dark enough, though. They need another pass ... or three.</div></div><hr />

I assume you're talking about his last response to the resource allocation question. So, being an arrogant little sh*thead and asking a condescending question is fine then I take it.

So when did you talk to &quot;almost everyone?&quot; I'm just curious. Go ahead and show me where you gathered info from seven million people and found the response to be overwhelmingly negative. Once you remember you didn't do that, maybe shut up.<br />

There's a difference between people quitting, and the dedicated bitchforce that sets out on the forums here and elsewhere everyday to whine about every. Fucking. Thing. That. Happens.

Blizz, my suggestion, why not introduce some lunar aspects? Some days/periods where we go real dark due to lesser moon, or a fuller moon will give some insanely bright nights but not in a light way, in a dark way as we have here in RL where shadows go nuts. <br />

You did well on this move, won't make me resub just yet but please don't stop there on the darker night front, it needs a little bit more tweaking.

Edit: had another look at the comparison pictures. Really Blizzard? That's not really half of what we were expecting. More menacing at night. Or more melancholic. It's not that hard to do.

I do remember staying up all night and still in the barrens at 4am with that music and night time wildlife is out and I feel menaced to go forward another 100M as I might die. Those were good days.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see them tie fishing or battle pet hunting to lunar phases somehow ;)</div></div><hr />

Not a bad call at all, let's use the planetary influences Blizzard. Let's make the world feel more alive, more dynamic.. break monotony. You'll see.</div></div><hr />

As for darker nights, this is pathetic. They need to move the slider a LOT more.<br />

There was a poll asking if people wanted it on the posts. They said they do. You're in the minority, you need to get over it. I don't want to read his opinions either. Know what I do? I scroll past it and read other things in the post. Much easier to do than bitch and whine and demand things change to revolve around you.<br />
<br />
I play mostly at night. I don't want to have to look at a perpetually black screen to give you ambiance.</div></div><hr />

They used to have one for weather and removed it. This is &quot;progression&quot; but it can simply be solved by adding a slider.</div></div><hr />

They had this in the past, only certain fish could be fished at night.<br />
Been a long time though and I haven't fished in game for years so, guess they got rid of it at some point?</div></div><hr />

In Vanilla WoW they actually had I believe 2 types of fish that were tied to the lunar cycle and only catchable at night - can't remember the names but one was in Feralas and I think the other was plated armour fish in AV when you could fish there.</div></div><hr />

I hope it doesn't happen, period. Much as I strongly disliked Ghostcrawler's stances on game design and his Blizzcon 2011(?) comment that personally insulted shamans, much as I don't care for Zarhym's snark or Lore's obfuscations... no one should go through what Tseric experienced.<br />

There's a difference between people quitting, and the dedicated bitchforce that sets out on the forums here and elsewhere everyday to whine about every. Fucking. Thing. That. Happens. People literally invent reasons to shit on Blizzard now. WoD isn't that good. We get it. Shut the hell up already. If you were really that upset, you'd have spoken with your wallet and WALKED AWAY by now.<br />

Unless you did, and you're still getting out of bed every morning to bitch on a forum...in which case, wow. Sad for you.<br />

and lol @ people complaining that this isn't content and that we aren't getting content in 6.2. I guess new raid tiers aren't content either. People apparently want a new raid tier every 2 weeks, gear raining from the sky, 200 new mini games, 700 dailies, a new zone every week and at least 10 completely unique mount models added every patch but NOT for the Blizzard store. But then the argument will be &quot;quality over quantity Blizzard, WTF&quot;. Oh and they don't want to pay anymore. Paying with gold isn't good enough, they want to pay with the air their characters breathe. Also, they want air added to the game. And a new game engine that let's them run it on ultra, 120 fps at all times with their laptop from 2007.<br />
<br />
Then and ONLY then will it bring back SOME of the quality gameplay of 8 years ago.</div></div><hr />

Nope, long term player here. What they done is absolutely abohhrent, they had absolutely everything in the bag. They could of made the game actually fun and have different terms of progression but hence they didn't and like Ghostwalker said &quot;i have really lost interest in the game, selfie patch really done it probably for everyone&quot;.<br />
<br />
I just pop in here now and then, just to see how the game is going and may enroll for a month since I can grab money with the treasure trove across 4 characters.<br />
<br />
What they should of done, made Garrisons server-wide so only 1 per server and if you level an alt you get an extra level in the garrison where adding up to the max allows you to have access to all buildings say every 1 character extra small plot, 2 extra character extra medium plot, 3 extra characters extra large plot where you have 1 extra building called Heroes' bunker where you can use your alts as followers allowing them to be used in missions or in profession when not in use. &quot;Players characters who are on missions cannot be used till they come back&quot; and some will unlock special missions which you cannot unlock without this feature this adds another path of progression.<br />
<br />
Ashran they shouldn't of touched it was absolutely fine and allowed progression into arena just removing all the features, just removed the path of progression altogether and just made the game fucking boring literally. It was fun till they started to fix things like adding 30 min timer, removing conquest, removing other things. Everyone was literally in ASHRAN TILL THEY FIXED IT. THEY FUCKED UP REALLY BAD ON THIS. Even new players who were overwhelmed got used to things and just found it intense till they slowed it to a crawl.<br />
<br />
So what does that leave since they don't have any progression? Just arena and raiding... exactly the same thing in MOP and nothing new. Blizzard removed the paths of progression or something to strive for and just gave us a treasure trove of stuff and need to time-sink on the same thing we done on the previous expansion good job blizzard.</div></div><hr />

I agree. Looks more like early dusk or sundown. This is especially noticeable in Darkshore and Winterspring. I'd prefer something a little darker myself. Maybe give players personal torches to lug about. I believe this was experimented with in beta, for Duskwood at least.</div></div><hr />

Dude, you know, negative feedback is not always &quot;whine&quot;. It turns to whine if a person starts to give same negative feedback over and over and over again, turning it into some kind of kids tantrums. I never saw any poll about this particular topic, and now I understand why these tweets suddenly start to appear in the first place. Which saddens me, but its not hard to ignore them, you know.</div></div><hr />
