TOR and Rift fans won't scream clone on this one considering our games borrowed alot also. This is just Blizz trying to stay competitive and adding features. I do agree with every poster that this is YEARS overdue.</div></div><hr />

Hacked accounts are sometimes used to farm old content, usually TK and Karazhan due to the high amount of gold you can get from killing mobs in there.Hackers are probably looking at this with a smile on their face, thinking, &quot;oh I can make X amount of gold in minutes in karazhan now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Also, getting mats to level up enchanting/tailoring will be made much easier now with this kind of thing ingame. Maybe the price of wool cloth will go down to something kinda reasonable vs the 20-40-60 gold per stack ive seen it at.<br />

I just tested in karazhan (the 2 rooms in front of Moroes) and was basically able to loot like 80 mobs in a matter of seconds. pretty awesome.</div></div><hr />

Umm actually no. I've played both Rift and SWTOR and Rifts and WoW is pretty much the same aoe looting is aoe looting how one can do it better then another doesn't make sense except that SWTOR's is actually better a beam of light comes off the corpse and the color of the beam indicates the quality of loot on the mobs so purple for example is epic loot. Regardless it's good to have but to start making silly comparisons like that is well just silly.</div></div><hr />

This actually makes normal players much more competitive in that regard. Killing loads of mobs is fun to many people, it's the looting that is tiring.<br />
With AOE looting it's not as much a grind as it used to.</div></div><hr />

Hacked accounts are sometimes used to farm old content, usually TK and Karazhan due to the high amount of gold you can get from killing mobs in there.Hackers are probably looking at this with a smile on their face, thinking, &quot;oh I can make X amount of gold in minutes in karazhan now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Also, getting mats to level up enchanting/tailoring will be made much easier now with this kind of thing ingame. Maybe the price of wool cloth will go down to something kinda reasonable vs the 20-40-60 gold per stack ive seen it at.<br />
<br />
I just tested in karazhan (the 2 rooms in front of Moroes) and was basically able to loot like 80 mobs in a matter of seconds. pretty awesome.<br />
<br />
You can only run 5 dungeons per hour and you can only do karazhan once a week, both non issues</div></div><hr />

AoE loot should have been implemented so long ago... heck Blizz should have been the one to implement this way before trion or Bioware thought of it. GG Blizz... but at the same time about time,<br />
<br />
If you look at the financial backers for Rift, you can see they have several companies in common with Blizzard (such as Vivendi). Add to that the fact that something like half the staff for Rift were former Blizzard employees and it seems more like it's Blizz's way of testing new concepts before pushing them into WoW/implementing them into Titan. Considering that former staff would have contracts forbidding them to work on similar projects, this theory makes the most sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, hackers normally have access to more than just 1 or 2 or 3 accounts at a time, they have access to a lot more accounts. <br />
<br />
What if they work rotating shifts between different accounts to 1) kill the massive amount of mobs in front of Moroes (without killing Moroes), 2) run out, 3) reset raid, 4) run back in to kill them all again 5) repeat 5 times, Then repeat 1-5 with another account, send gold away, etc. You can kill the trash for Moroes many, many times without becoming saved to karazhan this way.<br />
<br />
Im just saying that this kind of aoe loot might become a utility to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
This actually makes normal players much more competitive in that regard. Killing loads of mobs is fun to many people, it's the looting that is tiring.<br />
With AOE looting it's not as much a grind as it used to.<br />
<br />
indeed, but if normal players engage in this kind of playstyle (ie farm karazhan trash) blizzard might flag these accounts as suspicious, meaning there might be problems down the road if this whole thing isnt error-proof. Ive farmed Karazhan before out of experimentation on my DK, absolutely no use of 3rd party software, and my account got locked because it was flagged for suspicious activity.<br />
<br />
youre right though. Players might become more competitive against the gold-selling market with this kind of feature put into the game. I guess im a lil concerned about how the hackers will try to flourish from this, have a huuuuge gold count from this feature. out of the 10 million current active subscriptions, there are still some that purchase gold, and in doing so, support the ppl that hack others accounts.</div></div><hr />

hmm just a comment I pulled from facebook which is quite interesting in this regard:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm wondering what this will change for RNG loot tables (specifically world drop blues/purples). I have a strongÔªø feeling Blizzard's eventually going toÔªø make trash mobs in instances de-aggro after a certain time/distance because of what can now be done like in this video. It's true previous games/MMO's have had this for a long time, but every game's combat/looting is different. For exmple, the AH value on cloth across all the lower levels is going to change.</div></div><hr />

That's not the point. The point is that 1) it's a terrible design (especially when other MMOs use a similar model to each other which is far superior) and 2) it's taken this long to implement.</div></div><hr />

Pooling all the loot together into one interaction is a lot smoother than simply having the system click each mob for you.Either way, glad it's in!</div></div><hr />

You know that early complaining is key in a BETA. If you start complaining when it goes live you failed. Thats the reason for a BETA.. find flaws early to correct them. I underlined the important words here for you.<br />
However i didnt expect much more from blizzard.. History showed that they almost always failed when it comes to implent mechanics someone else made up... They take ideas from addons, or other games and do it themselfs...very bad. In most cases i still use that addon than the ingame UI.<br />

Right now it seems like Wows Versions creates a queue that klicks every mob after another wich isnt much faster than clicking them yourself.... in rift all Loot is combined in one Window. Klick &quot;loot everything&quot; or mark Autoloot and looting takes less than a second.All of the loot is combined into one window in the WoW version as well - in the video it showed the sum totals in the loot window that popped up, rather than the individual loot for one mob, and it only made a few 'picking stuff up' sounds based on each compiled stack of stuff being looted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you tested it yourself?<br />
<br />
From the video it looks like stuff is looted one after another.. the the flashing Frame of the Charbox tab whenever a ney object is added? See that the gold is added last after all others after he switched from combatlog to chatwindow?<br />
<br />
If it really is like you said its ok and i apologise but from the look of it Stuff is queued and looted one after another like i said.<br />
<br />
However in any case this is far better that no aoe looting and even if i am right and this is a clunky mechanic.. players will get used to it like they did to all the other stuff.<br />
<br />

I would exclude white stuff cause some festivalclothing, Leatherballs or weddingrings and several other stuff you wish to keep are white colored.. But sell all grey stuff would be a option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the difference of being surprised of a purple beam showing up, a purple item in chat log, or your bag? From playing swtor, I feel just as &quot;surprised&quot; as I do from getting it in my bag or in chat. It is just a quality of life upgrade to see it before looting. AoE looting is awesome, but still prefer AoE looting in swtor because not only do you get to loot multiple mobs at once, but you can see if multiple mobs are worth looting. If I kill a bunch of mobs, I do not always want to pick EVERYTHING up. Especially if I have a full bag or if I am running a lower friend or even a lower dungeon on my own. I usually just pick up greens, blues, and purples. The beam system allows me to see if it is worth running over to the mobs and clicking before I do. :)<br />
<br />
Obviously not needed, but an awesome addition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you post a video of someone looting 20-30 mobs at once in Rift to show us how it should be done?<br />
<br />
No Video here but you click on a Mob, and go on farming.. the whole looting takes only a splitsecond even with 12+ Mobs (if autolooting is activated). No annoying looped noices, stuff is added to your bags almost immediately not one after another. In most cases you loot and skin One or two Mobs before their Dyinganimation is finished.<br />
<br />
However this still will be a welcome addition... i am that type of Player that likes to AOE grind.. for example looting the whole scarlet Monastery after a Bossrush is a pain in the a...rm</div></div><hr />

The loot system in Rift is much faster. Just one click and you get everything just about instantly. In WoW? You have to wait for the loot animation, then wait for the window to appear, THEN the items get looted to you. It's at least a whole second slower than Rift.<br />

I can't say that we should expect wow to be instantly looting tons of mobs instantly, at least not without a complete overhaul to the way loot is handled in the game(from a coding standpoint). The looting system in wow has been in place for what? 8-9 years? obviously this is going to take time, if it is updated at all. I don't think anyone could say that this doesn't make looting multiples mobs drastically easier(someone will).</div></div><hr />

Instead of looting in parallel like SWTOR they bodged it to run a script of looting in series, so the servers treating each loot individually.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2012-03-23, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The loot system in Rift is much faster. Just one click and you get everything just about instantly. In WoW? You have to wait for the loot animation, then wait for the window to appear, THEN the items get looted to you. It's at least a whole second slower than Rift.<br />
<br />
Judging from the video, it took a long time for all the items to get looted to him. In Rift, even looting a ton of mobs, it's still instant.<br />
<br />
What you are seeing in WOW is caused by server load. Something Rift doesn¬¥t have with 5 people playing per server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. The beams of light are really something. Although I wish they would distinguish the &quot;regular&quot; loot and &quot;blue quality&quot; loot. The colors look almost identical when questing outside or in bright environments, whereas the gold, green and purple are much more distinguishable. I'd the possibly replacing the blue beam with an orange or red beam (since that is prototype quality) or keeping the blue and changing the regular loot beam with white beam. Just my thoughts.<br />
<br />
Also, it's nice to see WoW adding this much needed feature. Welcome to 2012 Blizzard. Still seems a bit clunky though :confused:</div></div><hr />

Yeah thinking about this, since you can't AoE Skin, Skinners beware of when you are farming if you have this turned on, the one thing that protects skinners skins is the fact that you have loot on them, with this as soon as you aoe loot, its open to anybody</div></div><hr />

Indeed. There are probably hundreds of thousand. Another factor was probably computer spec - better computers were probably invited so they could sort out the initial problems without whingers blaming blizzard when it was their own systems. Just a hunch.<br />

Except you are wrong, because you rarely see more than five people outside of a city at any given time, and hardly ever more than 20 per zone, if anything. The grand majority of people in WoW are sitting in &quot;sitties&quot; AFK or playing the auction house. The rest, PvP or PvE. <br />

Well, considering that Rift and SW:ToR are wow-clones (tor is almost literally WoW-in-space) I say it's fair game that WoW take something back.<br />
<br />
Competition is good for the business. More people beating on the same tired design, even if they're separate games, means more iteration and possible evolution of mechanics. I'm expecting both rift and tor to rip off wow's new talent tree design by 2015 if the new design is successful.<br />

I would agree with Rift and WoW being similar. But in WHAT sense is SWTOR and WoW similar. Questing isnt the same, BG bracketing isnt the same, Player companions, Social points for leveling together, Light/fark side routes depending on what you choose, incoming legacy system. I only played SW for a couple weeks, up to 35, but I find them nowhere near the same.</div></div><hr />

So what causes the lagging loot system in wow is basically the morons managing it all. They refuse to merge servers even though a lot of the servers around are basically dead. They first got an old ass feature like that implemented around now. The queue times in wow is not caused by slow servers. How is queues even possible when the game is so leet? because you need to wake the fuck up and see how much better others are doing at the moment. except blizzard of course. Swtor + Tera + GW2 should hopefully kill wow together. + lame ass expansion</div></div><hr />
