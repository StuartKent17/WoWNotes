<br />
Mythic bosses only can get tested for 1 hour on ptr in most cases and are mostly in a very unfinished / bugged /unbalanced state. The last boss of an raid is not tested on mythic on ptr.</div></div><hr />

They reached Garrosh by Sunday/Monday and they had some time to figure out which classes to gear after the reset. This can be argued as good design. Whereas in BoD they reached Jaina after the first day which means the first 8 bosses might have been too easy.</div></div><hr />

This is the best comment I read about this topic.<br />

<br />
I agree<br />
<br />
It's one thing for it to be a meme, you know &quot;haha, they killed it twice before Limit killed it once!&quot; But it's another thing for people like WoWHead to say that Method got world second. Repeat kills don't count towards rank standings. If they did, then half (if not more) of the guilds on the mythic raid leader boards would be ineligible for their rank and therefore title/glory.</div></div><hr />

Wowprogress says: 265m 55s	<br />
So it's maybe 2 hours or so. (don't know how many pulls can they fit into that)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is that why one of them did a quick jig, logged out and uninstalled WoW seconds after getting WF (on-stream)?<br />
<br />
Perhaps he just cba to spend 2 months preparing for the latest raid tier anymore, it's become a job..</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure it's the first time in a WF race that the same guild got the world first and world second kill ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, there were plenty of times in past guilds killed things twice before anyone else. For example, Lich King 25 Heroic was killed by Paragon and went a full 2 weeks before being killed by anyone else in the world. This is already old since they retracted and amended their original post. Method didn't have the recognized world 2nd kill as that would be dumb.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">b1ackbird</div><div class="date">2019-02-11, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wonder what would happen if, let's say Method, get WF. Then for the following week moves their characters to another guild, and kill it again. Will that be counted as 2nd?</div></div><hr />
