Winter Veil 2014<br />
The Feast of Winter Veil (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/141-feast-of-winter-veil) is here and brings new gifts this year! When you unwrap your present this year, you will find a Crashin' Thrashin' Shredder Controller (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116763-crashin-thrashin-shredder-controller) inside. If you missed last year's gift, the Crashin' Thrashin' Flyer Controller (http://www.wowdb.com/items/104318-crashin-thrashin-flyer-controller), you can find it in Stolen Present (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116762-stolen-present) from the daily quest.<br />
<br />
This year once again adds an updated version of the Miniature Winter Veil Tree (http://www.wowdb.com/items/117371-miniature-winter-veil-tree?bonusIDs=553). The Stolen Present (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116762-stolen-present) can also contain the new Scroll of Storytelling (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116456-scroll-of-storytelling), which gives your camera an old time sepia effect. <br />

Garrison Addon - Bulkie<br />
Today we are taking a look at a simple addon that saves you from repeated clicking. Bulkie (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/bulkie) will queue up the maximum number of work orders with just one click! If you want to press one less button, take a look at BulkOrder (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/bulkorder), which will start adding work orders as soon as you talk to the NPC.<br />
<br />

<br />
Patch 6.0.3 Hotfixes - December 16<br />
Garrisons, Followers, and Outposts<br />
<br />
Garrison Buildings<br />
<br />
A hotfix in testing from December 11 for the Inn has been implemented. The achievement, Stay Awhile and Listen now only requires the character to complete 10 of the 20 Inn quests (down from all 20).<br />
<br />
<br />
Creatures and NPCs<br />
<br />
Shadowmoon Valley<br />
<br />
Yggdrel now deals less damage with the Entangling Vine ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons, Raids, and Scenarios<br />
<br />
[Hotfix currently in-testing] Messages for obtaining an Augment Rune are no longer broadcasting to the party or raid group.<br />
Raids<br />
<br />
Highmaul<br />
<br />
Tectus' health has been reduced by about 15% when the raid is scaled to 10 players on Raid Finder, Normal, and Heroic difficulties. As the raid scales up to a maximum of 30 players, Tectus' health for 30 players remains roughly unchanged from before this hotfix.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
Enchanting<br />
<br />
[Hotfix currently in-testing] Mark of Blackrock can no longer trigger its effect for the first 40 seconds after equipping the weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
UI<br />
<br />
Resolved an issue where having a player join the Dungeon Finder or Raid Finder group just as another player was leaving could cause the button to queue up for additional players to remain greyed out for the rest of the group.<br />
Resolved an issue where the Darkmoon Faire was not showing up in the in-game calendar past December 2014.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrison Outpost Hotfixes<br />
These changes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/353839-upcoming-garrison-outpost-hotfixes/#post1) went live with today’s restarts. In addition, players who had already switched their outpost buildings prior to today should now be able to access the quests and follower associated with the new building.<br />
<br />
Just a quick update: we're working on a fix for the issues with buildings reverting as well as being unable to actually pick up the follower. I don't have a solid ETA just yet on when that will apply.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
glad sanctum conquest goes towards the Ashran bonus, right? I put in a ticket and got a super canned answer <br />
it does not (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/542691969303347200))<br />
<br />
~100% of Top 100 in 3v3 arena EU and US = Alliance. &quot;Ah well, it is time for the alliance to shine.&quot; - Holinka 2014<br />
I never said that (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/542692124077346816))<br />
<br />
A lot of ppl are wondering how many times a week you can get an epic drop from a daily Ashran win?<br />
Once per week (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/542704967224918016))<br />
<br />
Neither faction nor class representation is anywhere close to balanced.. Sad to see the game in such state.<br />
Many players are overly fixated on representation but probably because it is the only metric to look at. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/542705522328494082))<br />

The 2 set PvP effect is now dispellable too, to keep it in line with the Enhancement version. Then again, why the set bonus for Enhance was nerfed in the first place...</div></div><hr />

Oh get out. Windwalker Monks; mr Monk Portrait? Despite that 5% windwalker stance nerf, you're still leagues ahead of every other DPS, <br />
<br />
And I'll remind you: FoL nerfed, Selfless Healer nerfed, pvp set bonuses crippled and made dispellable. <br />
<br />
Ret Paladins took /years/ to be become vaiable and stay there. Free of nerfs my arse. Now we've been strong for a month and we're &quot;forever&quot; free of nerfs.</div></div><hr />

People who use tickets to ask questions like these are the reason everyone gets a &quot;super canned answer&quot; even for legitimate issues that need fixing. People need to learn to look up information for themselves before asking for help.<br />
<br />
Also, wasn't that inn quest hotfix already live for like a week now? I was awarded the achievement awhile ago. Incorrectly, I might add, since there's no way in hell I had done 10 at that point. Maybe like 5 at the most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I finished all 20 quests a day or two before the hotfix went in. On one hand, I'm pretty disappointed in the change -- I thought it was trivially easy to get the achievement, even after they made it require killing the end boss (I play mage and just invised to a lot of the items). On the other hand, some people don't nearly have that kind of time required to log in every day and grab every quest.<br />

<br />
It's a non-answer. The racial balance in PvP is atrocious. The Alliance racials are insane. Worgen's Darkflight, Draenei's Gift of the Naaru and Heroic Presence, Dwarf's Stoneform, Night Elf's Shadowmeld Human's Human Spirit + Every Man. Most of these are crazy good passive buffs, or effects you would normally find on a potion or trinket.<br />
<br />
Horde have junk for PvP racials. In fact, they just have junk for racials. Every Man for Himself is a TWO minute cooldown and removes EVERYTHING. Will of the Forsaken is a THREE minute cooldown and only removes a few things. How stupidly unbalanced is that?</div></div><hr />

&quot;Anyways, could you talk about the design decisions behind the balance of racials? I know I'm not alone here when I say it feels like the Alliance has a definite upper hand compared to the Horde.<br />
'Ah well, it is time for the alliance to shine. Horde has been quite the trendy thing for the last decade it seems. ;] ' &quot; <br />
