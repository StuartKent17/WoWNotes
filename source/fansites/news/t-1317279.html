<br />
Patch 5.3 Hotfixes - July 3<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Mage<br />
<br />
Talents<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where certain situations could cause Mages to not receive the Invoker's Energy buff after successfully completing an Evocation (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/12051).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Battle for Razor Hill: Fixed an issue where players were becoming stuck because the Zulu Rock buff was not being removed when the player dies.<br />
Mogu Incursions: Master Snowdrift should no longer be engaging in combat with Shan'ze Invaders, allowing players to turn-in the quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br />
<br />
Throne of Thunder<br />
<br />
Ra-den<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Scenarios<br />
<br />
Blood in the Snow: General chat has been temporarily removed from the scenario to fix an issue affecting General chat in Dun Morogh. A proper fix for this is in the works in an upcoming patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Isle of Thunder<br />
<br />
Made additional fixes for an issue where players may be unable summon incantation bosses.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Character / Items<br />
Any reason the Valor of Ancients buff isn't cross realm, The rep bonus is but alts would find this a very welcome change.<br />
It's a difficult technical challenge having to do with e.g. raids unlocking at different times. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/347090428207722497))<br />
<br />
I realize you didnt design the tier 16s, but I was hoping warriors would look like Garrosh not a paladin with horns sewn on.<br />
I used to weigh in more on player feedback of art sets, but it turns out art is just sooo subjective. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350643880993103876))<br />
The best thing I can suggest is maybe just feedback on armor themes you'd like to see (e.g. Your Garrosh example). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350644011012333568))<br />
<br />
In this blog (http://t.co/FXKQ4KrLur), you said legendaries would be more exclusive than in Cata. Why make them more accessible?<br />
With the current legendary quest, everyone can have the expectation of getting them so it's fine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350651458850533376))<br />
yet.... they aren't &quot;legendary&quot; any more. people are expecting too much for nothing.<br />
Another reason why they aren't weapons. Our grand plan will likely make more sense closer to 5.4 ship. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350653375701983234))<br />
<br />
it disapp. me that now there's a leg. for everyone and it's a cloak thats shaped like a towel and clips models. Why no weapon?<br />
We feel like we've done that a lot before. We want to keep things fresh. When rewards are too predictable they get boring. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350652781041946624))<br />
These are a pretty different design than Fangs / Wrath. The problem with those was the expectation / entitlement. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350651006666805248))<br />
When there is too much expectation, the item goes from feeling like a bonus to a penalty. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350651279208480770))<br />
<br />
I am thoroughly disappointed with the legendary being a cloak. All of this work throughout the xpac and we don't use it again.<br />
What do you mean by &quot;don't use it again?&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350646916398325760))<br />
These cloak models are pretty much standard fare, don't stand out from normal gear. Most people will hide them<br />
The cloaks aren't intended to compete with glaives though. Wouldn't glaives be less special if everyone was rocking them? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350656078746353667))<br />
<br />
Please make the questline cloaks non-unique. I'd love one for my offspec, just like I could get offspec gems.<br />
We're still discussing it, but it's on the table for sure. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350655512028774400))<br />
<br />
Any chance of with all the changes bring brought in, cross-faction flex raids might be a possibility? Or dungeons.. anything?<br />
We feel like cross-faction goes against the spirit of World of Warcraft. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350643398165794816))<br />
<br />
PLZ let us do flex w/ &lt;10. Scaling floor can still be 10. Current challenge for our small guild is just getting 10 online.<br />
Understood, but we have to draw the line somewhere. If we say 8 then the guilds with 4 will feel excluded, yanno? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/344256954279006209))<br />
<br />
Trying to understand self-loot in Flex. If they're our FRIENDS, why would we be so distrustful? Prefer normal loot rules.<br />
It is mostly because we don't have a system yet to scale number of drops with number of players. Maybe in the future. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/348469844682866689))<br />
<br />
is there any chance to avoid drops at 10man that doesnt fit to anybody in raid? Like: &quot;no rogues&quot; then &quot;no dagger(agi)&quot;<br />
What if you then stacked 8 rogues to make sure your real rogue had a good chance at a dagger? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339062701076656128))<br />
Thats not what he is saying at all what he is saying it eliminated the chance at something if there is none not visa versa.<br />
They are the same. If I can force loot not to drop then I can force it to drop. At the end of the day it comes down to loot speed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/349298464594731008))<br />
We have a target for how long it takes to earn loot. If we speed it up in some ways, we'd just have to slow it down in others. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/349298656639328256))<br />
<br />
Is the game balanced around raid loot priority Tank &gt; Healer &gt; DPS? Discussing loot system in my guild ATM.<br />
No. We have found that guilds use wildly different methods for determining loot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/349189816467984385))<br />
You can also make the argument that gearing DPS before healers improves success. Shrug. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/349189975541161984))<br />
<br />
Any idea how you will deal with Rune of Reorigination and UVLS? Seem irreplaceable for some, even w/o seeing new trinkets yet.<br />
Would that be the end of the world? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/347935693156265984))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Just need to work on ligistics, archaelogy failed horribly in moving from one dig to another. They don`t put you in the world<br />
Archaeology had too much travel time at launch. I think it feels better in MoP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/347393406152097793))<br />
<br />
Reputation / Questing<br />
Any chance we will see a return to the daily style of 5.1? That was by far your best imo. Scenarios, story, felt progressive.<br />
We were getting a lot of negative feedback about daily quests at the time so we wanted to try something else for 5.3 and 5.4. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/347387228659539968))<br />

&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/june/gw2g.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:-2px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom&quot; /&gt; Guild Wars 2 Content Release Frequency<br />
There were a round of interviews (http://www.guildwars2guru.com/news/1186-mike-zadorojny-interview-round-up/) with some of the ArenaNet developers recently, and it appears that it isn't only WoW players that want content faster. Currently GW2 gets some sort of an update every 3 weeks or so, with the Bazaar of the Four Winds (http://www.guildwars2guru.com/news/1183-bazaar-of-the-four-winds/) update coming next. <br />
<br />
ArenaNet is now aiming for content updates every two weeks going forward.The developers that work on these updates are split into four teams that are each working on their own update, allowing for enough time to properly test and catch many of the issues that arise from rapid development and frequent patches.<br />
<br />
Another interesting point that came up in the interviews is the lack of planned expansions. Rather than adding expansions to the game, the current plan is to continue with the Living World concept and just keep adding new content every few weeks. This content development is funded by purchases in the in game Gem Store, which amounts to enough to keep the team of over 300 developers going strong. The game has sold 3 million copies as of January this year though, so ongoing sales likely play a role in this funding as well.<br />

Doesn't mean much when only 1/5th is the actual playerbase.</div></div><hr />

Bold statement, care to give the source of your numbers?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrKnubbles</div><div class="date">2013-07-06, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting Paladin set. The second color is my favorite. I just hope it's obtainable for me.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carighan</div><div class="date">2013-07-06, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">His or her source is that she feels that another game being successful is a bad thing for WoW, and hence should not be mentioned on a WoW site. I suppose. Because sense.<br />
<br />
I mean that's like saying WoW's subscription numbers are meaningless because only a fraction of those is active. Certainly true and easy to verify ingame, but meaningless as far as monetary status of the game goes. So long as even those not actively playing keep renewing their sub, that combines monthly income with lowered server hardware costs, so it's a win/win for the devs.<br />
<br />
Likewise in GW2, so long as the playerbase keeps logging in for the biweekly content and between that sometimes buys fluff items from the gem store (they got me with the dancing book for example :P ), that's a win/win. The online playerbase is large enough to group for anything players want so it's no critical numbers issue, and players are logging back in with the content so the money is coming in.<br />
<br />
Inactive players can be a very good thing as a developer. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually one of the reasons why I love GW2's business model so much. I can log in ANYTIME there is new content, experience it for a couple days/weeks, log out, play other games etc and then log in again when there is newer content without ever having to pay a dime or feeling that I am lagging behind in gear. It motivates me to play the game frequently while at the same time protects me from burn out as there are no bad consequences to just stopping playing for a couple weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try again. Most servers are are full or high population. In January the active concurrent players were more than 1 month after release. These are facts. Yours are not.<br />
<br />
Play what you want, like what you want, but stop telling lies about that game. GW2 is going very strong, deal with it. I'd rather question Blizzard if they can't do more while their competitors release free content patches every 2 weeks while asking for no monthly subscription. Then feel free to play and enjoy whatever you want, but this stream of &quot;inaccurate&quot; statements about every game which is not WoW is really dumb. <br />
Every single day in GW2 related forums someone pops up to say &quot;I heard that this game was dead but it's actually very vital!&quot;. You are not doing the WoW community a great service by giving the impression that you are just sour about the possibility that other MMOs may be successful. They can, that's a fact. It's not like that takes anything away from you. It should rather be a motivation for WoW developers to do better.</div></div><hr />

Slaughtered pigs bleed subs? Anyway, 'bleeding' or not, the current playerbase is still 5x of newer mmos after all this time. You can stop working on your paper mache gravestone for wow now.</div></div><hr />

Completely agree<br />

Downloaded Kingdom Rush Frontiers (iOS) the other day, and it's fun, but feels cheap playing it when I know I could just pay extra money for nukes and stronger heroes to do all the game for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though that may be true, WoW also has possibly up to or more than 50x the number of servers that newer MMOs have. An MMO with as much content as WoW on a server like US-Medivh that seems to have maybe 200 active Horde definitely feels like a dying (or bleeding out) game.</div></div><hr />

We feel like we've done that a lot before. We want to keep things fresh. When rewards are too predictable they get boring.<br />
These are a pretty different design than Fangs / Wrath. The problem with those was the expectation / entitlement.<br />
When there is too much expectation, the item goes from feeling like a bonus to a penalty.<br />
The &quot;expectation/entitlement&quot; is mostly Blizzard's fault - they gave us a legendary weapon in classic WoW and every expansion afterward prior to MoP. MoP was partially a welcome change from the norm in that we got a legendary gem and meta, but many still had the reasonable belief that at the end we would be rewarded for our efforts with a weapon. Sorry Blizzard, but the cloak slot isn't all that &quot;legendary&quot;.<br />

It's that they look bad on the male human model. We don't really get to see how cool they look until we see them on appropriate races. The druid and shaman ones for example probably look much better on a tauren, for example. I play a troll and I hold my judgements until I can view the sets on a 3d model viewer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Play what you want, like what you want, but stop telling lies about that game. GW2 is going very strong, deal with it. I'd rather question Blizzard if they can't do more while their competitors release free content patches every 2 weeks while asking for no monthly subscription. Then feel free to play and enjoy whatever you want, but this stream of &quot;inaccurate&quot; statements about every game which is not WoW is really dumb. <br />
Every single day in GW2 related forums someone pops up to say &quot;I heard that this game was dead but it's actually very vital!&quot;. You are not doing the WoW community a great service by giving the impression that you are just sour about the possibility that other MMOs may be successful. They can, that's a fact. It's not like that takes anything away from you. It should rather be a motivation for WoW developers to do better.<br />
<br />
Strong? There are 6-8 servers in GW2 with healthy populations, the rest of the servers are dead. By dead I mean you won't see more than 30-40 players period. Try leveling a new character, you will see no one in low level zones, for a game that is not even a year old that is pretty terrible.<br />
<br />
In terms of actual data, they have lost anywhere from 80% to 90% of player activity since launch per Xfire. Website traffic to sites like Guildwars2.com and GuildWars2Guru have dropped 80% since launch. Per Raptr, GW2 is on par with SWTOR in terms of hours played (and SWTOR is supposed to be a &quot;failure&quot;). The traffic of /r/guildwars2 has also dropped 70% to 80% since launch. Again, all these various sources show a 70% to 90% drop in players.<br />
<br />
Now this is not unique to GW2, many MMOs come out have a peak during launch and fizzle. GW2 also followed the same route, it is just like every other MMO out there. It is not special it was not &quot;more successful&quot;. Today it is on par with SWTOR. But the future isn't so bright. NCSoft is putting all their money behind WildStar, so don't expect any big expansions from GW2. At least not while WildStar is around and popular. That is the reason Mike told players not to expect an expansion, the game doesn't have NCSoft's attention.<br />

<br />
Servers being &quot;Full&quot; or &quot;High&quot; don't matter. Rift and SWTOR servers said &quot;Full&quot; and &quot;High&quot; when servers were dead. Developers can say &quot;Full Server = 300 Concurrent&quot; and call it a day. It means nothing.<br />
<br />
I would love to see a source on that January stat you posted. That is impossible, since most data said a 70% drop from Sept '12 to Jan '13. If your source is Colin, please read what he wrote again. There is nothing factual about your statement.</div></div><hr />

It is funny how you manipulate your evidence. Some proponents of GW2 (or any other game as a matter of fact) may do this but you are no better. Website data does not translate to game activity. It might indicate a trend and yes, that is a fact that GW2 lost a lot of players compared to the launch month. But so did every other major MMO with two exceptions, WoW and EVE Online (but the second one being a niche game). That does not make all those games failures or dead titles. If you would use such line of judgement, than pretty much every online game apart from WoW, LoL and CoD is a failure. Going back to your website statistics. I visit MMO Champ more often than GW2 website and I dont play WoW since quite some time while I play GW2 almost every day till now. When GW2 launched I visited their website several times each day. Now I do that much less often. So according to you I should be an example of someone who plays WoW atm. Which is not the case.<br />
<br />
You mention Xfire stats but only in terms of activity loss. Why not compare activity of WoW from MoP launch month to current one? You also mention Raptr stats where you indicate that GW2 and SWTOR has similar hours played stats yet you completly ignore the fact that SWTOR has been out for 19 months and GW2 for 10 months. That puts GW2 with almost double stats compared to SWTOR, not bad considering with how strong franchise brand SWTOR started out. <br />
<br />
You claim that all but 6-8 servers are dead. I cant refute this becouse I dont have a character on every server. In this regard I can only provide anecdotal evidence about my server and I can say that the population is quite healthy. I see around much more people than I seen in WoW before the CRZ implementation. After that I would say they were pretty much comparable. But since I mention that. Do you have a character/account on every server? Do you transfer every month? If not, where do you pull your evidence from? <br />
<br />
In the end, it does not matter which game is &quot;better&quot;. It is all in the eye of the beholder. I spent my fair share of time in WoW. I will always respect this game. But right now I personally prefer GW2 and prefer to play it rather than WoW. And guess what, GW2 is not dying nor is dead. Same as SWTOR, same as Rift. The game will only be dead once the servers will shut-down as happened in cases of SWG or Tabula Rasa. Before this happens, none of those games are dead or something that &quot;nobody cares about&quot;. And to please a bit the ego of WoW players, despite some subscriber losses in recent months, WoW is not dead nor dying as well. I hope you will all be able to enjoy your game for years to come without trying to prove to anyone who plays something else that all other games are worth sh** compared the only title that matters.</div></div><hr />

No manipulation here, it is all facts. GW2 is pretty much done for. I mean if you look at their sPvP servers there are like 300 people across all server during Primetime. Yes, just 300 people in sPvP. That is pretty terrible.<br />
<br />
I agree with you, GW2 is SWTOR tier. They probably have similar populations. It isn't &quot;dead&quot;, but it is pretty much done once WildStar comes out and NCSoft treats it like the red headed step child that it is. Which is why the post by MMOChampion says there won't be big expansions, there won't be funding.</div></div><hr />

What facts? I think I replied to you before about most of your &quot;facts&quot; but you decided to conviently not read it. If you want to stand by your word, respond to that instead of saying &quot;its all facts&quot;. Your &quot;facts&quot; are worth same *** as &quot;facts&quot; of some doomsayers around here who claim WoW will die in 6 months.<br />
<br />
GW2 same tier as SWTOR? Maybe. I dont know. I played SWTOR for 2 months only and then I left. What turned me away mostly was terrible game engine. WoW has great engine but its also terribly old. IMO GW2 is the only major MMO with combat/gameplay smoothness on same level as WoW. GW2 is not on same activity levels as WoW but if you call it &quot;done for&quot; than I dont know what other MMO is not &quot;done for&quot; at the moment. Unless you try to imply that there is WoW and only WoW and nothing else matters. If that is the case, sorry, but after spending close to 10,000 hours in WoW I have enough. <br />
<br />
Also &quot;there won't be big expansions&quot; is yet another of those magical &quot;facts&quot;. If you would be so informed as you claim you are you would know that the &quot;big expansion&quot; for GW2 can go either way as there were multiple conflicting voices from both ANet and NCSoft on this matter. It was said in NCSoft shareholders release that the expansion is already in production. While folks in Anet said conflicting things about it. From straight &quot;there wont be&quot; through &quot;no plans as for now&quot; to &quot;possible in the future&quot;. Its all a corporate PR bull***. <br />
<br />
And another example of how you manipulate. You ignore the fact that ANet is pushing to release new content every 2 weeks (becouse, well, that does not sound like a dead game so better ignore it) instead you nitpick a quote about &quot;no big expansion&quot; and extrapolate that to &quot;this game is done for&quot;. Any more creative &quot;facts&quot; on the way?<br />
<br />
Oh and. About that 300. What exactly is that &quot;sPvP server&quot; you refer to? Are you aware that there are no dedicated PvP servers in GW2? Also, where are you pulling that 300 number from? ANet didnt released any statistics so far. Or are you trying to do the same thing as people who calculate entire WoW population based on stats on WoWProgress main page?</div></div><hr />

You are wrong on so many points.Neither GW2 or GW1 will be dead or done for.They both are played and will be played.The model Anet is using works just fine.Their servers are healthy and the game is doing more than fine.Yes it lost some of its player base but those players that liked it have stayed and the B2P model will ensure that new players will come.<br />
Also keep in mind that GW2 still hasn't been released in China and Korea.And in those two countries WoW's player base is big.What do you think will happen if you cut the Blazzard's Asia market and released it only in the western countries just like GW2 did?WoW's player base will be reduced with 1/3 minimum.When GW2 is released in the east too it should grow.</div></div><hr />

WoW today - less than 1 million minutes played<br />

Unless you are willing to say that WoW has lost 97% of its playerbase in the last 4 years you can clearly see that people do not use that site anymore. People use Mumble, Teamspeak, Ventrilo and Skype.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did too last August. I checked back over the months as patches came in. Things slowly changed and then one day several weeks ago they implemented control fixes, optimizations and most recently balance changes. The game really is much better now than it was at launch, or I wouldn't be playing it. PvP has finally gathered interest with the balance changes, WvW was always popular, but with the new systems its received is even more so. Dungeons take time to learn, they're different, but once you L2P they're enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Something a lot of WoW people wont like is that you WILL die. A lot. It's harder than WoW in every part of the game except heroic raiding. If you like heroic raiding, you'll appreciate the challenges of GW2 world, dungeons and upcoming content. If you like the world in WoW, oneshotting everything you'll probably be frustrated and on your back a lot. World bosses are boring and easy though, but they're a reliable source of income and gear so while disappointing it's easier to accept when you're getting paid.</div></div><hr />
