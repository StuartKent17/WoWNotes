Weekly Bonus Event - Battlegrounds<br />
A new weekly quest and rewards are here—steel yourself for Battleground combat!<br />
<br />
Seven Days on the Battlegrounds<br />
All this week, heading to the Battlegrounds will net you some extra Honor along with bonus loot for completing this week’s quest. To enter the fray, open Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select the Player vs. Player tab. Next choose Casual, select Random Battlegrounds, and hit the Join Battle button—you’ll be matched up with other players and sent to one of the 11 battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
Weekly Quest<br />
Before you get started, Archmage Timear (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest for you (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/44173-a-call-to-battle). Win four random Battlegrounds, and you’ll be rewarded with 5 Marks of Honor, a Badge of Honor (1000 Honor), and a Glory of the Melee Artifact Power token (base 500 AP).<br />
<br />
Battleground Buff<br />
This week you gain 50% more Honor in Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
A New Event Every Week<br />
The Bonus Events system consists of a rotating schedule of different activities, currently scheduled to run each week beginning on Tuesdays. Each Bonus Event grants a passive bonus to a particular game activity and offers a once-per-event quest with a noteworthy reward for accomplishing a related goal. The in-game calendar can serve as your one-stop reference for the event schedule. The Adventure Guide also offers a direct link to active Bonus Events, allowing you to easily accept any associated quests.</div></div><hr />

I wonder what the odds of this happening are? I'd think winning the lottery would be pretty close to the same chance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Making some very loose assumptions from this old thread (https://ipc.enjin.com/forum/m/1262786/viewthread/27629548-legion-titanforged-warforged-chance-spreadsheet), multiplied by the probability of the item dropping, I'd say about 1 in 10 million. But hey, never give up.<br />
<br />
Edit - wait, no. I assume the OP meant from the world boss...so it'd be 1 in 10^26. That's roughly the number of atoms in 12kg of carbon.<br />
<br />
Edit number 2 - big numbers are fun, aren't they? If you counted up to 10^26 at one number per second it'd take you 100 million times longer than the current estimated age of the Universe. I'll stop now. Don't shout at me.</div></div><hr />
