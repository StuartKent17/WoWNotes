Paragon Finished Raiding<br />
Paragon has decided that they are done raiding. You can find the full article and list of kills on their site. Congratulations to them for many years of World First kills!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/february/paraGone.jpg (https://www.paragon.fi/news/end-of-the-road) <br />
<br />
We have decided to stop raiding which obviously means we will not be a part of the world first race in Legion. In the end it came between going international, playing with suboptimal Finnish roster or quitting. For a while I was seriously considering going the international route, but in the end decided it was not worth the trouble for me. This question has been looming over our heads for a long time as it has always been a challenge to get a solid Finnish 20-25man roster together and this time there was no 10man option to bail us out.<br />
<br />
Going forward I have no idea if we will be playing WoW in any capacity in the future, we will have to see what is the situation when Legion launches. In the meantime you might see some of us in the fields of Overwatch.<br />
<br />
I would like to thank everyone who played in progress raids with us and made this all possible.<br />

Legion - Soft Foam Sword<br />
A recent Legion build added the Soft Foam Sword (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/137663-soft-foam-sword). It currently kills most mobs rather than reducing their health, but it does appear to work on critters. The current max level for creatures you can use it on is 20 levels below your character level, meaning it will work for Mists of Pandaria and older content once you are Level 110 in Legion. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Legion - Water Striders<br />
Thanks for the feedback, and I apologize for alarm caused by a seemingly random change. What you see in our weekly Alpha builds is a snapshot of thinking that is often actively evolving, including experiments that we’re about to discard, or solutions to problems that are overly crude just because it’s our first iteration and we simply haven’t come up with anything better yet. <br />
<br />
I’d like to shed some light on our thought process in exploring this change. No, we’re not trying to stamp out fun, or destroy the value of hard-won rewards arbitrarily. The concern that drives this process is that mounts are primarily cosmetic choices, and are one of the most visible ways of showing off an aesthetic you enjoy, or an achievement of which you are proud. But water-walking makes Water Striders mechanically superior to other ground mounts in a way that risks removing a feeling of choice. Even if you want to show off that Invincible that you finally managed to farm up, or your Grove Warden, you may end up feeling foolish for using anything other than the Water Strider in areas where you can’t fly, just because it offers that mechanical advantage. <br />
<br />
Our initial change was aimed at letting people feel more free to choose the mount that they felt looked coolest, whether in new content or while leveling alts. But as we’ve clearly heard from your feedback, removing the water-walking functionality from pre-existing content feels like we’re taking away something that you have worked hard to earn, and that cost outweighs any benefit from potentially broadened cosmetic options. <br />
<br />
So, in the next Alpha build, we’re restoring the ability of Water Striders to walk on water in all pre-Legion content (Azeroth, Outland, Northrend, etc.). The restriction on the mounts’ water-walking ability will now only apply to the Broken Isles and future content beyond that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Legion<br />
is there any point at all in the EU alpha forums? just let us in the US instead?<br />
Yes, absolutely. We read it all. Just easier to respond on US forums. Assume you'll see responses, regardless of where they are? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/700136774337634304))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Then we have other Blizzard employees denying that Fel would be a form of life magic, like Matt.<br />
So now I'm just wondering if Sean Copeland lied to me and others.<br />
I think I just wasn't clear tbh Nature spells use life energy, fel spells burn/consume life energy/souls, ya? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700445532343259138))<br />
that's more of a semantic discussion than a lie, if something burns life, is it &quot;life magic?&quot; IDK &quot;life magic&quot; isnt (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700446276999995392))<br />
really all that well-defined, not sure it's been mentioned in-game, outside of maybe chi? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700446473771573248))<br />
bottom line is: no one is telling you lies, there isn't a conspiracy or anything, it seems to be mostly word choice (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700446728806203393))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
If I may ask, what do you think makes MOBAs such a popular genre for e-sports?<br />
Easy to understand the action. Good stories both on and off the field. You can be a fan at lots of different levels of intensity. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700034567147646976))<br />
By the latter I mean you can see your favorite champ get played or get into nuance of individual player preferences and history. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700034786283298816))<br />

That'd mean they have to make ground mounts be able to fly, too. Also, did anybody really exclusively use the water strider because he might want to cross water? I always just used my favourite mount and only switched to a water strider when I actually needed it.</div></div><hr />

Another convenience item butchered as a result of some misplaced judgment on how we the players decide/choose what mount we used. <br />

By this logic: My Zulian Tiger can’t fly and I want to use/show it off, therefore please remove the ability to fly from all flying mounts please.<br />

this is a needless change to counter act something for a reason that just isnt significant enough to justify the change and rather than bring &quot;choice&quot; back, it reduces utility and takes meaningful choices out of the game.</div></div><hr />

Yes I always use the water strider for the chance of having to cross water.<br />
Its more convenient to just stick with that one as its the best choice.<br />

I don't know if &quot;toxic&quot; is the right word here, but I'm definitely happy to see world first guilds slowly retiring. World first race has been a joke for several years now, with only a handful of guilds &quot;racing&quot; against each other.<br />
<br />
There was basically no competition at all, and that's one of the reason Method quit a while ago. World first was flawed as only 2-3 guilds in the world were able to spend entire weeks constantly raiding all day (plus all the time spent in beta), cutting out 99% of the community. The introduction of 20 man only Mythic futher killed the progress scene to a point were just two guilds were competing.<br />
<br />
When gating was a thing, competition was more interesting, but still stupid. WoW is not, and will never be, a competitive game since time invested plays a major role in it.<br />
<br />
With Method and Paragon out of the game, I suppose Serenity will shortly follow, and we will finally get rid of this stupid &quot;competition&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because, as I said, it never was a competition.<br />
It's not a race if Method has no opponents in the 25man bracket for all of Cata and MoP, neither it was for Paragon in the 10man bracket.<br />
It was a joke before, and now with these two guilds gone what exactly are we going to see in Legion? Serenity racing against who exactly?<br />
<br />
You and others enjoyed watching a bunch of people that had the time to wipe 13 hours per day for 2 weeks until they popped an achievement, I don't. My idea of competition is based on skill ALONE. If I want real competition, I'll go watch LoL LCS, DOTA International, Quakecon or Starcraft International.<br />
<br />

Don't be butthurt. To kill those bosses designed with a certain ilvl in mind, with lower ilvl do need skill and high knowledge of the game/classes itself.<br />
<br />
Of course I don't feel anything about guilds that even if only once, abused something wrong to get an edge, like LFR bugs, saronite bombs, etc.<br />

How does this competition hurt you in any way? Maybe some others find it fun to watch this competition every few months.<br />
Not sure why you would to get rid of things others enjoy but hey .. to each their own I guess.<br />
<br />
Actually it does in a way hurt the game for some players.<br />
<br />
Like Blizzard nerfing FL heroic to normal level as soon as the 1st guild killed Ragnaros. If you were the type that had fun trying to progress in there (and we should have at least 5 more months before anything would happen to the instance. 6 months is the normal life time of a raid/pvp season patch), the competition removed your fun in that way.<br />
<br />
All the beta training also hurts in a way (even when people try to hide a bug/flaw in beta to use in live servers) since to some, it spoils the fun by having all the strats layed out as soon as the game is live. That kind of player will have to constantly find 19 other players that want to progress that way instead of sit and wait for the next boss strat.<br />
<br />
And the list goes on. If it doesn't hurt you, does not mean that it won't hurt anyone else. This is a game with a diverse player base.</div></div><hr />

Time invested doesn't negate the fact that its still skill based. RNG isn't effecting the outcome of their attempts, the boss doesn't just collapse out of pity after X number of hours invested, how is it not skill based? Yeah I don't really care about the world first race either, nor do I care to watch other people raid, but I feel your dislikes and opinions are colouring your idea of what is involved in that race.<br />

Realistically the cutting edge is always going to only contain a few regardless of how many people in total can participate.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly the sad state that WOW is in when you have comments like this about a well respected guild and a system that does not harm your play in anyway. But it got people interested in the game as a whole. They going to make this game so casual that all that will be left is one button easy facebook game like mmo. And then would you casuals be happy then? No you be miserable because no one will be playing it. <br />

Rofl are you serious?<br />
They are removing a mount’s waterwalking ability while that same effect remains in tact for certain classes. I don't get how that would be the same as “Class A has a spell that I don’t have, please remove it from class A”. Everybody has access to the Strider and now it is being taken out.<br />
<br />
My questioning was legit. Blizzard doesn’t want a waterwalking mount it seems , yet certain class abilities that also grand waterwalking remain untouched giving them an advantage over players that play a different class. Why are you so upset and claim it to be my ‘entitlement attitude’?</div></div><hr />

Have a questline or multiple objective achievment that unlocks water walking for all your mounts. Similar to how flying unlocked in dreanor.<br />
I'm sure they can come up with some kind of lore or story for those that care about a realistic reason why its possible.<br />
Classes and effects that previously granted waterwalking can be converted into a speed bonus while walking water.<br />
Or another possibility is that this new water walking ability has a duration bar (like breath) and those classes and effects could increase or negate that timer.<br />

Yup. There needs to be a 10 man mythic because some guilds just don't have the structure for a 20 man mythic setup.

Heh Legion must have some important water zones.. Without water walking it will take some people a little longer to finish the water parts, therefor making the expansion seem longer than what it is..<br />
<br />
I was thinking the same! Slow down progress, make people think it's BIG expansion. In reality, I do pretty believe it will suck ass.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2016-02-26, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't be butthurt.

<br />
<br />
This would have more meaning if the guilds were making fresh, brand new attempts when the expansion releases - but they don't, they have been wiping and learning throughout the beta, and have their raid teams stacked with every advantage they can come up with before release - what quests to do right away for what gear, buying out anything on the BMAH that will help them, what classes to bring, they know the strats and bosses, or enough to plow through the first couple of bosses easily...it's not really as impressive as it looks. Yes, they are more skilled than most players, but it would be far more impressive to walk into a new raid with no knowledge of it beforehand, and be the first to figure out all the fights.<br />
<br />
And..who's to say an up and coming guild won't take their place? There were more than just two or three guilds trying last time I looked - it's just the top 2 or 3 had a lock on the races...until now. If I were in that world, and had a good raid team that was just on the verge of being able to take on the race now that Paragon is stepping down, I'd be spending the next couple of months building up my team to give it a solid shot. This black and white mentality is amusing - Paragon quits, there is no more world first raiding, because there are only 2 or 3 guilds in the world, right? C'mon. Someone is gonna step up. You know it's going to happen.<br />
<br />
The only good thing with no real world first race is the inevitable &quot;OMG the game is too easy all of the content has already been beaten in two weeks&quot; crowd will have nothing to snivel about. Oh, wait - WoW - they'll find something else to whine about. Endlessly.</div></div><hr />

It's also insanely hard to recruit and maintain 22ish people when 2/3 of the playerbase quit. The recruitment forums are a wasteland. It's too late for Legion so I don't see the raiding community becoming healthy again till wrath of the lich queen. Hopefully they come to their senses by then.</div></div><hr />

I think, from my casual glancing at the alpha news, is that Legion will suck less than WOD. But, i don't see what will make it rank with MoP or TBC or Wrath. The devs work with an iterative mentality - they don't wipe the slate and start over, they tweak was was there before - thus the garrison is now the class hall, with new paint and tweaked mechanics. The artifacts are the Legendary Ring on a bigger scale. The questing I'm sure will be identical to WOD - on rails, fast, and lacking depth. The dungeons...I haven't read anything about dungeons in Legion, so I won't comment. But it all sounds like &quot;WOD with fixes and tweaks&quot;. We don't know how far the story will go, either, so it's hard to judge - or how many raid tiers and content patches they have in mind. If it's as much as MoP, that's great. If it's the same as WOD...they will have a problem keeping players around, again. The no flying decision points to a return of WOD leveling - being stuck in valleys and trenches with only one entrance and exit, and having to finish content to get to the exit, which was one of the more disappointing things about WOD leveling, how &quot;on rails&quot; it was - every alt has essentially the same experience every time - all so the devs can force feed you vistas and content, and keep you from blowing through the scant content too quickly. <br />
<br />
It would be hard to suck as much as WOD, or more, so it's safe to say it will suck less. But I haven't seen anything yet that compels me to want to play, it all just sounds like more of the same. Even if I were interested, I'd wait until people actually started playing it to decide - they burned me once on WOD, that won't happen again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To everyone else crying about non water walking, get over it. You have to swim? Too bad. If they design a whole underwater zone, that would be stupid as hell and has no precedent except for the cata zone in which you were given a freaking fast as hell sea horse. Giving EVERYONE the ability to bypass water nullifies the point to having any water area in the first place.<br />
Some classes have the ability because it's their flavor. Just like mages can teleport across the world, hunters have pets to effortlessly take on difficult mobs, rogues have stealth to sneak past mobs, warriors can leap across barriers, priests and mages can fall of high places to get to other areas faster, etc etc. These are all &quot;flavor&quot; abilities and SHOULD be kept to classes instead of mounts (and imo the damn ring will be nerfed to match their philosophy as well somehow)</div></div><hr />

Haha, I'm saying that getting to and from water questing areas is slow. Blizz knows this and it takes some time. <br />
Of course water areas aren't there to ONLY to slow you down, just the majority of them.The water areas that don't have any quests associated with them, block things or make areas unappealing to travel to. THOSE ONES are there for &quot;slowing you down&quot; or making you want to travel around them. Water walking lets you travel in a straight line to your destination.</div></div><hr />

Still won't change the fact that time played an equal if not larger part in the races, making it a no-competition from the start.<br />
<br />
I suppose you're right. All of the most successful businesses have owners and employees that only clock in their required hours and then go home right? Extra time is never really correlated with reward or prestige. Ha.<br />
<br />
I can somewhat agree that Beta is killing this and would be nice to force on the fly adaptation, however all guilds that have a chance at world first (top 100+) get beta, so the playing field is at least even; winning just because you found a flaw first isn't the same.<br />
<br />
Why should people be shunned for putting in extra time though? It's indicative of world views, those who get more because they do more are looked at like they are mental and don't deserve what they've achieved. It's shit. <br />
<br />
It sucks that Paragon has to go, they were/are amazing players, but they made that choice and I can respect that. Don't act like this is exclusively because of 20 man. It's already smaller than the 25 which is smaller than the 40 man people praise so much. It's because they chose to limit their player-base; it'd be like trying to make a super NBA team that's completely white, sure it's possible to make that team and win, but let's be real, the selection is limited and sheer numbers shows there to be more exceptional black players than white; keep the same ratio of black to white and multiply the player base by 10 and now you have a better shot. <br />
<br />
That was a bit of a tangent, but point is: blame the waning popularity of the game, not the size of the damn raid team required, 20 people of even 1 million is NOT many.</div></div><hr />

Or another possibility is that this new water walking ability has a duration bar (like breath) and those classes and effects could increase or negate that timer.<br />

RIP Paragon and water strider from the game. No sense in riding it now. Thanks Blizzard for slowly destroying your game.<br />
<br />
No harm, you say?<br />
<br />
Guilds like Paragon are the reason we have cookie-cutter builds, even with the new talent system, and if you play with any other talents you're shamed and told that you're just holding back your team because your DPS may or may not be 0.1% lower. The top raiding guilds have essentially been driving the design of the entire game, even in completely non-raiding parts of it. That's pretty fucking toxic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if it was so much 10 mans that killed the guilds as much as it is the lack of content keeping people engaged long enough when they weren't raiding that was the bigger issue. Me personally I hated 10 mans. It felt like a glorified 5 man or a LFR where you happen to know a few people and not a realistic feat of accomplishment. They didn't bring a large amount of the guild together as people only really got to know their 9 other people really well and that was it. There was little room for error if someone DC'd or couldn't come that night. No one wanted to sit on the bench for a 10 man team when there were 1,000 more of that same level they could join.</div></div><hr />

I really don't care Paragon quit raiding; it's not as if it hasn't happened before.

World first race has been a joke for several years now, with only a handful of guilds &quot;racing&quot; against each other.<br />
<br />
There was basically no competition at all, and that's one of the reason Method quit a while ago. World first was flawed as only 2-3 guilds in the world were able to spend entire weeks constantly raiding all day (plus all the time spent in beta), cutting out 99% of the community. The introduction of 20 man only Mythic futher killed the progress scene to a point were just two guilds were competing.<br />
<br />
When gating was a thing, competition was more interesting, but still stupid. WoW is not, and will never be, a competitive game since time invested plays a major role in it.<br />
<br />
With Method and Paragon out of the game, I suppose Serenity will shortly follow, and we will finally get rid of this stupid &quot;competition&quot;.<br />
<br />
In a way you're totally right. In a more accurate realistic way THOUSANDS of guilds track progress on their server and globally and make an effort of say 20 hours at least a week to clear new content quickly. <br />
<br />
Is there any competition, anywhere, that doesn't involve a huge time investment?<br />

<br />
Speaking as someone who raids mythics, most of these super difficult mechanics are trivialized by an addon. Mythic raiding isn't some uber difficult thing, and in comparison to previous expacs, gear, rings and addons have made a lot of bosses 'effectively heroic' for a guild. Less people are clearing due to the severe hemorhaging of players and the fact that 20man raiding while the rest of the content is 10-30 absolutely slashes the upward mobility of players who want to get better and move from heroics to mythics, it's just not worth the hassle when before guilds depended on normals to groom players for the heroic mode.</div></div><hr />

The raid size is irrelevant. I've raided high level (on and off with periods away from the game) since vanilla. 40man, 25man, 10man, 20man.... Doesn't make a fucking difference.

In a perfect world, I'd say go for your life. The existence of 10mans as a concept doesn't bother me tbh.<br />
<br />
There are problems with their existence in the real world though: the split in the raid scene causes a lot of problems (e.g. stupid debates about which is harder, gearing issues etc), and the drain on resources of Blizzard for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's what really baffles me about the thought process at Blizz sometimes:<br />
<br />
Blizz: &quot;Looks like people use the water striders a lot more than normal mounts. We're concerned that the water walking granted by the striders is making mount choice irrelevant so we're going to limit the striders to their respective continents where they were earned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Players: &quot;Wait, what?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizz: &quot;Well, after hearing your feedback, we're only going to restrict them to all content up to WoD. In Legion and going forward, you can't use their water walking anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Players: &quot;WTF?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizz: &quot;Well, we talked about it some more and we decided not to restrict them whatsoever. We were just concerned that their water walking ability was curtailing choice in mounts; we're really okay with water walking.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, why is it that their go-to reaction was to beat the striders into virtual uselessness rather than, say, make it so that if you have a water strider on your account then all of your mounts can similarly walk on water in the exact same fashion?</div></div><hr />

Has everyone forgotten raids used to be 10/25 mans for both normal/heroic (heroic/mythic now), and that Blizzard gave the option to only have 10 or 25 to clear the hardest content. Most guilds, not all, but most picked the option to downgrade to a 10 man roster for reasons (I won't say it was easier, I have my own opinion and won't try to change yours). In essence, giving the 10 man option killed the raid community. If anyone remembers those days, they should remember the multitude of players suddenly without raid spots, the in flux of guilds that never went anywhere because those players didn't want to lead or couldn't get along, or the multiple guilds running raid group A and B. 20 man did not kill raiding. Giving the option to do 10 or 25 clears killed raiding, 20 man just sealed and buried the casket.</div></div><hr />

My idea of competition is based on skill ALONE. If I want real competition, I'll go watch LoL LCS, DOTA International, Quakecon or Starcraft International.<br />

<br />
Guess what, genius. Every pro player in your preferred games plays it for 13 hours per day for months. Their skill is playing the same scenarios over and over until they are muscle memories. Not a real skill for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW has been great, just got into it recently! My friends and I are doing the Mythic 20-man raids until the ex pack for Legion is released.<br />
<br />
How about all you old farts that started 10 years ago step away from the game for Legion. The rest of us want to enjoy it or are new to the game. Your whining is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Go play a different game if you don't like WoW anymore. Give us all a break.<br />
<br />
errr the change to switch back to allowing water striders all around was made quite a long enough while after the news post was made here.<br />

I do not play beta so I have no idea if their are water zones or not.. So I could be wrong.. Do you know if there is a lot of water zones which is why you are saying this, or am I sensing a lot of butt hurt over what I said??<br />
<br />
the entire concept of what you said is ridiculous that's why. The expansion does not have any important water areas where water walking is a major advantage. No more than any other expansion where crossing a pond or lake saves you seconds of convenience. Even then having water walking would not prolong content in any significant manner (water is easy enough to cross anyway, and content in water is located....IN water, not ontop). So it doesnt really help in finishing &quot;water parts&quot; even if they did exist (and btw Legion provides items for faster swimming, loads of such items already exist etc)<br />
<br />
Also &quot;Butthurt&quot;? Are you capable of actually forming sentences with original thought or do you just have your mind flip through internet statements and cliche's when you need to choose something to say for the sake of saying something?</div></div><hr />

Nope, can't see it. Help me find it.<br />

Congrats to a group of people who can sit in a chair longer than others. E-athletes are pathetic.<br />
<br />
Of course there is a correlation between time spent sitting down and placement in the races to world first. But do you really think that is all there is to it? Also, do you think actual esports such as LoL or CS:GO are all about spending time in chairs?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Okorsis</div><div class="date">2016-02-29, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I might actually like blizz to make Mythic 10man the only raid size for just one expansion.... And then laugh my ass off as the same people complain that they can't fill their 10mans and that they just want to play with their 4 other friends in 5 man content.<br />
<br />
The raid size is irrelevant. I've raided high level (on and off with periods away from the game) since vanilla. 40man, 25man, 10man, 20man.... Doesn't make a fucking difference. People will come and go from the game, and all raiding guilds have periods of roster issues. The vast majority of guilds either die, or become populated by completely different rosters, such that they may as well be different guilds anyway. <br />
<br />
The amount of you thinking that the end of Paragon validates your stance on the raid size is fucking hilarious. The vast majority of people don't play this game forever with no time away. That includes high level mythic players.<br />
I think the same way!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Extremity</div><div class="date">2016-03-06, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what does this mean for my Foam Sword Rack TCG item? :( I was always really proud to have that, a friend of mine that worked at Gamestop with me years ago bought EVERY TCG pack we got and never got anything. He convinced me to buy some one day, so I bought two. Each had a loot card, one had the rack and the other the sprectral cub ride thingy. He was piiiisssed. Still never got anything.<br />
<br />
Anyways, yeah, doesn't this sorta ruin things for people who got one of those? I know you can still play the &quot;bonk&quot; game, but it was nice to have the only way people could wield a fake foam sword D:</div></div><hr />
