Removal of Realm First! achievements for Ulduar 10-Man<br />
Other players in this thread brought up the same conclusions we came to. A hardcore guild that is full Naxx25 geared will get some Ulduar25 items, then go to Ulduar10, crush it for the realm firsts, then head back to Ulduar25. We didn't like the game design that involved this and changed it in the recent PTR build.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the patch isn't out yet so tweaks and adjustments can still happen for achievements. <br />
<br />
A possible solution ...<br />
Achievements are separate from progression, that said something we are looking into implementing is an achievement (like killing Algalon) in 10 player Ulduar that will require players to only be using gear that matches the item levels in Ulduar 10 (includes hard mode items). This would make it a pinnacle to shoot for in groups that only do normal level raids while still requiring heroic raiders to organize their gear appropriately to tackle it. This achievement could also have a unique title reward to go along with it.<br />

Blue posts<br />
PvP - Battlegrounds Item Rewards<br />
We would LOVE to offer good gear through BGs, don't get me wrong. It's clear from this thread alone how many players enjoy BGs. In the case of &quot;BG epics&quot; it isn't a philosophical opposition to having better rewards. We just haven't figured out a great way to do it yet. YET. The usual pitches tend to come down to:<br />
<br />
1) Just give everyone epics. Despite S1 and Naxx 25, this really isn't the goal. <br />
2) Make it very random, like you have a small chance to get an epic. /wrist<br />
3) Reward number of BGs won, which feels very grindy because the number would have to be large or you have situation 1 again. One of the things we like about both Arenas and raids is the gear rewards are gradual because of the lockout. You can't play 24/7 and gear yourself overnight.<br />
4) Have organized BG teams. Yet, if you think the logistics (and queues) are painful for a 5-player Arena team or a raid....<br />
5) Reward skill. This is the answer we like the best, but is also the hardest to institute. If you played many games, we could eventually get a sense for whether your presence helps determine whether your side wins or loses. But there are a lot of other factors at play -- how coordinated your side is, whether the other guys are AFK, is someone just honor farming, is someone griefing, etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/15864310217-soarenas-failednot-surpisingly.html))<br />
<br />
PvP - Class Representation<br />
Specifically on the topic of Arena representation, you have to be careful how you interpret those data. Consider:<br />
<br />
1) Depending on which numbers you present, your data can be used to support your argument more or less.<br />
2) When a class has low representaiton, you have to decide is that because they are too weak or others too powerful. For example, some specs are popular because they counter other popular specs.<br />
3) Popularity and viability have a correlation but it is not 1:1. Druids have never been the most popular class in WoW. There are a ton of DKs right now. Some players will abandon them when their power is more in line, but others will continue to play them because they like the class or have already invested in them.<br />
4) The community mindset typically seems to be: just keep buffing under-represented specs even if that means giving them potentially overpowered abilities. We try to balance from a broader point of view. For example, if you make an ability too overpowered you are just going to have to nerf it later. We try to peer into the future a little bit and address potential balance problems before they get out of control.

10 Players raids vs. 25 Players - Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16019602132-gc-quote-clarification.html))<br />
10 Man content is there to allow small guilds and casuals a way to see content. Blizzard realizes that having raid content that is so hard many people cannot see it negates raiding purpose. As such we have created 10 man content, a gimped version of the real 25 man raid. <br />
Our support of 10-player raiding is a recognition that some guilds just prefer to be small. <br />
<br />
Naxx 25 was puggable, this was not the intent. We do not want 25 man to be a bunch of randoms getting together to clear our content. Naxx 25 was that way, Ulduar 25 will not be pug friendly. <br />
Naxx being puggable is fine and really inevitable. The problem was that Naxx 25 was so easy compared to 10, that 10 felt like a pointless exercise. Ulduar 25 will not be as pug friendly as Naxx. I suspect it will be pugged at some point, but it may take longer. Don't forget that many guilds already knew the Naxx encounters very well when LK shipped. <br />
<br />
Since Ulduar will create a gap in raiding guilds and it seems Arena is dying, we have created greater rewards for arena as 1. and avenue to get better gear and 2. make people play arena. <br />
I'm not sure exactly what you're asking here. A lot of players are doing Naxx 25 because it is quite easy compared to the challenge of getting Arena gear. Ideally say item level 226 gear should take the same level of skill to earn in PvP or PvE. When the PvE content is more challenging, as it will be in Ulduar, some players will naturally shift back to PvP as their progression path towards gear. <br />
<br />
If the 25 man raids are not Pugs and they should be cleared by 25 man guilds, does this mean that the 10 man raid content is just &quot;dumbed down content&quot; for these guilds and should be skipped? <br />
If you are in a guild organized around 25-player raiding, then you may not get as much value out of also doing 10-player Ulduar. But it depends. If you can do 10-player hard modes, that gear is an upgrade to 25-player normal. Doing 10 hard might help you gear up for 25 hard, though you could also do the same thing just by running 25 normal a lot. Ultimately, though, the intent is that you pick 10 or 25 and focus on that. We don't prevent you from doing both if are interested in it. <br />
<br />
Do you guys recognize that a lot of people feel some of the 10man hard modes were overtuned?<br />
Many would argue that the 25-player modes were undertuned. Sarth 3D was intended to be something that guilds worked on for weeks. At first it looked like that was going to be the case, but after groups got geared up, most guilds that seriously tried it seemed to be able to manage before too long. We don't think that will be the case with Ulduar. It should keep you busy. But we'll see. You players are a clever lot.<br />
<br />
13.6% of guilds have done 3 drakes in 25 player. 4.2% of guilds have done 3 drakes in 10 player - AND that includes guilds who are wearing 25 player gear. Why can't you just admit you screwed up on 3D for 10 man and made it THE hardest encounter in the game? Considerably harder than the 25 man version in fact, and the proof is in the numbers. <br />
I am saying we screwed up and made the 10 player harder a lot harder than the 25 player version. I think you are arguing from an absolute POV that 10 was hard and 25 was on target. You could just as easily say that 10 was the target and 25 was too easy. <br />
<br />
I can see that it is not worth the effort to run 2 10s to gear up before 25s. <br />
Correct. It is not the intent that you run 10 to gear up for 25. If you ran 25 Naxx, you should be ready for 25 Ulduar. The only exception might be that some of the hard modes are hard, so doing 25 Ulduar, then 10 hard Ulduar might give you an edge on 25 hard Ulduar. But it still isn't required. <br />
<br />
Did the developers legitimately think that? The time it took to learn and complete the 3 drake encounter could be counted in not weeks, not days, not even hours, but minutes... trash included. <br />
Oh, this is just Sarth is srs bzns talk. It was challenging. Most guilds had to look at the videos of how the earlier guilds did it and it took them awhile to gear up for it. It wasn't M'uru and it wasn't supposed to be, but it was supposed to be harder than it ended up being. A lot of the guilds who could do Sarth 25 still have not done Sarth 10 though, and that isn't by choice in every case. We'll see how long it is before hard mode Mimiron and Yog and Algalon are srs bzns. My guess is a long time. <br />
<br />
This isn't proof of anything, it's your point of view. The only information I can gleam from it is that.. you want those unhappy with the faulty 10 man progression path, to be more vocal. Got ya. <br />
If your contention is that 10 player raiding is harder than 25 player raiding, then we disagree. The logistics of managing 25 players in our minds outweighs the &quot;marginalizing individual effort&quot; that you mention. I could see a way to have 10 and 25 drop the same loot but also share a lockout. Anything else will just kill 25 player raiding IMO, which is not something we want to do. We do however want to support 10 player raiding, and that means making the difficulty more appropriate for the rewards. If that isn't challenging enough for you, we do have the 10 player hard modes. <br />
<br />
Raid composition and &quot;Sunwell&quot; effect for hybrids<br />
However, the Sunwell probem we are trying to avoid was pretty consistent and widespread. There was some variation in raid composition, but not much. I think it's far too early to declare that any LK class is headed in that direction. All we are currently seeing is a lot of &quot;My GM said we won't bring dps warriors anymore,&quot; or &quot;My GM says Resto shamans are terrible now.&quot; <br />
<br />
If any of this turns into an actual trend, we'll all know it and it will be pretty obvious to everyone. DKs (of at least some specs) being too good at tanking, dps or PvP was pretty obvious to everyone except maybe a few DKs. (I know, everyone like to poke fun at the new guy.)<br />
<br />
I understand some of you are just trying to catch a problem before it blossoms out of control. Nothing wrong with that. But we're always going to be pretty cautious on acting based on early predictions that don't have a lot of evidence (even theoretical evidence) to back them up.

Blade Barrier mechanics in 3.1 - Sacrificying Threat for Mitigation?<br />
I feel like you arbitrarily defining &quot;bonus&quot; versus &quot;normal.&quot; If it increases your mitigation, that's something you want as a tank. If the cost of that mitigation is too high, then it may not be something you want. So far almost all DKs still seem to take it. We balanced the old version around the assumption that it was nearly always up too. <br />
<br />
2) Blade Barrier - 5 ranks. Decreases damage taken by 1/2/3/4/5% and whenever your Blood Runes are on cooldown increases healing done to you by 5%. <br />
That is an interesting idea, and is consistent with the Blood theme. We would probably go with all of that happening when your Blood Runes are on cooldown. We'll keep it in mind if DK survivability seems to fall behind. <br />
<br />
If you're balancing around the assumption that it's always up, why is it not passive?<br />
<br />
I see where you are coming from, but that isn't the model we use very often. We balance around the assumption that priests cast Fort or that tanks are trying to generate threat. That doesn't mean the logical conclusion is just to make all of those passives.<br />
<br />
One of the things we like about BB is it rewards the DK for using up those runes and not just sitting on them, yet you can use them on whatever you want like D&amp;D or Vampiric Blood. If anything, we'd like to have *more* active mitigation abilities, but nailing the cooldown and cost right is tricky. It is easy to get them into the realm of spammy at one extreme or saved for that critical moment (that may never arrive) on the other.

Giving Vanish a .5 second immunity to stealth breaking<br />
That's an idea that has come up a few times. It may be something we experiment with, but it's not the kind of thing you can just slap on and call it done.

Changes to fear damage treshold in 3.1<br />
We don't like how much damage dots can do while a target is feared. It prevents us from being able to balance fear as needed as a defensive ability and it keeps us from being able to adjust locks or priests in other ways. We're trying to move PvP more into a place where you do X and someone counters with Y, and the &quot;dot and fear&quot; strategy just seemed too simple yet effective. Honestly, if the classes with fears didn't also have strong dots, it probably would not have been as much of a problem.<br />
<br />
We don't think stuns needs a major change at this time. We dropped rogue PvP effectiveness in other ways, as I am sure they will be more than happy to explain to you. If we decide to make stuns break on damage right away then we would need to coordinate that with changes to rogue survivability. They are a melee class balanced around not taking much melee damage (because the target can't fight back). Locks and priests are by and large ranged classes.

Heroic Strike Spamming<br />
This is the heart of the problem. HS in theory is something you use when you have more rage coming in than you know what to do with. In theory you stop using HS when rage is low, and then pick it up when rage is high<br />
<br />
The problem is that bosses hit really hard these days and we have given warriors a lot of ways to make their attacks cheaper. As a result, warriors are often flooded with rage while tanking anything remotely dangerous. You can literally HS every single white hit.<br />
<br />
We can't just cut the rage per damage number without a lot of testing, because that would affect not only tanks in low-rage situations (like tanking a heroic with great gear) but it will also affect dps warriors, especially in PvP. Hitting a warrior is always a double-edged sword in PvP because you are giving them resources.<br />
<br />
A long-term change would be to make even more of tanking warrior threat come from damage done and really scale back the threat from damage taken. Maybe you would HS after a big dragon breath or something, but you wouldn't be able to turn 90% or more of white hits into Heroics. Of course we'd have to make sure threat overall didn't suffer, so you can see how this gets to be a pretty big change (bigger than 3.1 in any case).<br />
<br />
The other approach is to let HS be a toggle or something else that can bleed off rage without requiring the player to hit the button virtually every 1.6 sec (or faster).<br />
<br />
Yet another approach is to get rid of the on-next-swing concept. Make HS something you do when you have lots of rage and make Devastate something you do when you don't have as much. Again, we'd need to make sure that the tank could do something if they felt aggro slipping away.<br />
<br />
Even longer term we need to think about whether we're even happy with this model of tank takes damage and converts it into threat or not. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/16019952452-idea-make-heroic-strike-more-like-revenge.html))<br />

<br />
<br />
On bosses where you can see them cast you can just hit vanish and time it so you wont take any damage.<br />
<br />
A Naxx example would be Saphiron, where a skilled rogue (and yes there would be people who would be able to do this), could just carry on dpsing Saph, and then when ice bomb hits they just hit vanish and become immune.<br />

You have probably never played a rogue and you have never been hit by hunter's auto shot while vanished. In PvP, vanish breaks without ANY reason. And it happens more than often.</div></div><hr />

Just a question, the immunity to stealth reaking... doesn't that mean exactly that? Immune to leaving stealth?<br />

However, the Sunwell probem we are trying to avoid was pretty consistent and widespread. There was some variation in raid composition, but not much. I think it's far too early to declare that any LK class is headed in that direction. All we are currently seeing is a lot of &quot;My GM said we won't bring dps warriors anymore,&quot; or &quot;My GM says Resto shamans are terrible now.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
What Sunwell problem? Sunwell was one of the best tuned instances ever released. Sure the first kills were got by stacking, but that's not a problem that needs solving. Especially when the &quot;solution&quot; has led to far worse problems. My guild ran the same basic, balanced raid setup from T5 to Sunwell. Sure we weren't competing for first kills but there was no need at all to do any stacking.<br />
<br />
The overriding theme in these Blizzard comments is the refusal to admit that there were fundamental failures with the WotLK end-game and no sign of correcting any of these. It's all just &quot;oh things were a bit easier than we thought, but they were supposed to be easy&quot; when there has been an outcry of a magnitude that has never been seen before in the history of this game.</div></div><hr />

Why is Blizzard making these mistakes to Hunters in every major patch? Everone Hunter ive spoken so far is going to spec MM upon release. The BM buffs are just not good enough, the Surv nerfs are again to harsh, and the MM buffs are very nice compared to the other trees. Every Hunter loves being a MM, and now that the tree is becomming better then the others its not hard to predict whats gonna happen. The MM tree is now perfectly balanced, and a Hunter could take every nice talent in that tree and still be able to take the best out of the Surv tree.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly this can only result in a nerf to MM. Blizzard is trying so hard not to make BM OP, and to spread out Hunters to spec different builds.<br />
They do not understand that nerfing a popular build like Surv only results in 95% of the Hunter community rerolling to the next fotm spec. Same thing happend to BM.<br />
The whole &quot;we wanne make every spec viable for PVP and PVE&quot; design is a failure. There will always be a spec better then the others, and its impossible to balance that.<br />
<br />
The only way they could ever spread out Hunters over different builds is to NERF every spec to oblivion, and then buff every spec with new original and refreshing abilities. Then Hunters will need time to experiment with the different builds, only to eventually pick the best out of the 3 builds.<br />

<br />
1) Depending on which numbers you present, your data can be used to support your argument more or less.<br />
2) When a class has low representaiton, you have to decide is that because they are too weak or others too powerful. For example, some specs are popular because they counter other popular specs.<br />
3) Popularity and viability have a correlation but it is not 1:1. Druids have never been the most popular class in WoW. There are a ton of DKs right now. Some players will abandon them when their power is more in line, but others will continue to play them because they like the class or have already invested in them.<br />
4) The community mindset typically seems to be: just keep buffing under-represented specs even if that means giving them potentially overpowered abilities. We try to balance from a broader point of view. For example, if you make an ability too overpowered you are just going to have to nerf it later. We try to peer into the future a little bit and address potential balance problems before they get out of control. <br />
<br />
<br />
What a crock of shit, they keep making the same mistakes letting the exact same problems come back over and over again they have not fixed a single PvP issue ever! they replace one problem with anther.. they keep going on and on about how they are trying to bring balance (around what?) and that the current situations isnt that bad.. But 3 years have past and we still having classes using optimal gear and pvp specs with 0% representation and other classes with 18%. Your not getting any closer your getting further and further away..<br />
<br />
Until you stop remaining clueless to problems during beta, PTR's and leaving them on live for months and years. Nothing good will ever come out of it.. Bottomline is they need take a step back, take some time out and actually fix the problems and stop sticking plasters on everything.. I can spend 3-4months getting owned by DKs 27/4 if it means balance will come, but spending 8months getting owned by DKs only for a new patch to come out and instead of DKs its hunters that totally own, that is just lame.<br />

Get a clue, not every hunter wants to play MM, where the fuck did u get that from???? I loved SV ever since the PvE/PvE spec when BWL hit.<br />
Also, whining about how SV is crap etc etc etc (like 99% of the rest of the hunter community) is alos silly...have u even been to PTR? SV is toping dmg trailed by MM. SV will be fine. And atleast SV is way more fun then MM, hands down...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Im not saying SV isnt fun to play. Fact is most Hunters were either BM or MM pre wotlk, and the 0.5% that you belong to was Surv. BM was only popular in PVE because it had the highest dmg output, but i doubt any Hunter liked playing it in PVE spamming BW and Steadyshot. Surv may very well be fine in PVE dmg cause of blackarrow 6% dmg increase to alls shots + the new TNT 6% dmg to explosive = 12% dmg increase - 10% dmg nerf to Explosive shot = 2% dmg increase to Explosive shot and 6% dmg increase to all other shots. The way traps work still fail though, trap launcher is needed for all Hunters. Freezing Arrow should either be replaced with (pick ur trap) Arrow, or removed and replaced by an entirly different designed arrow that shoots a trap at a target instead of click, aim, shoot, pray someone doesnt move in the next 2 seconds. A CC ability on a 30 sec cd (22 as surv) that instantly procs when shot doesnt seem to OP to me compared to spammable sheeps, cyclones, fears, hamstrings, and stunlock.<br />
<br />
Surv has lost every PVP survivability it had to make it valid for Arena, and tbh it doesnt have much in the 1st place. <br />
<br />
- TNT stun removed without giving anything back.<br />
- Random 4 sec roots with frost trap replaced by a 1 time 4 sec root effect. <br />
- Explosive shot dmg nerfed for PVP purpose, and in return give a useless ability Black Arrow with an even lower proc chance for TNT. <br />
- Removed 9% crit on explosive shot replaced with a 4% crit increase glyph aka a Major glyph spot lost to get the exact same thing as we have now. <br />
- Aspect of the Monkey Glyph replaced for a useless Mend Pet glyph that non ever needed. <br />
- Disengage nerf back to 30sec because Survival (only) could spec it to be 16 sec with glyph which was OP.. so they nerf Disengage for ALL Hunters aka a Major Glyph spot lost to get the exact same thing as we have now. <br />
- Wyvern Sting glyph nerfed, and duration to 6 sec. As if Wyvern was such a reliable CC.. dispellable and breakable. Why not make all PVP cc's last 6 sec? Only a Hunter should get a worse CC since they have oh so much allready in 3.1 -.-<br />
- Vipersting nerfed to drain 4% of totall mana over 12 seconds (lol) still easy dispellable so the 300% regen it gives wont benefit anyone, the 400 mana it costs wont even be regened the 2 sec its on a target.<br />
<br />
And then MM. 100% chance to daze a target for 4 sec every time you succesfully hit with Chimeara shot, glyphed at a 9 sec CD + Concussive shot could keep a target dazed the entire fight. Silence shot &gt; Wyvern Sting when it comes to a reliable, non dispellable, non breakable &quot;cc&quot;. And it has a lower CD as well.<br />
<br />
If your telling me Surv hasent got a insane amount of nerfs for PVP, you should get a clue.</div></div><hr />

Now Druids are no where to be found in any spec. Perhaps my logic is skewed, but it seems to me that the arena representation numbers are much more credible than they are allowing themselves to see or admit. <br />

<br />
Sunwell was one of the best raid instances the game has seen.<br />
Sure many guilds wiped for weeks and weeks and weeks on end.<br />
<br />
But how many of these guilds would say they didnt have fun doing it?<br />
Im willing to bet very very few would say they actually didnt have fun.<br />
<br />
And lets face it, what would most people want? Decent raid challenges that last months, or an insatnce on farm from week 1.<br />
<br />
I know what i would prefer. And it isnt the &quot;whoa, we got this place on farm on the first week it was released&quot; option.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. If it wasn't for the gate system, sunwell would have been cleared by a good chunk of the top guilds within 2 weeks, and by the remainder of the top guilds within 3. And M'uru v1 was about as fun as hammering nails into your testicles. (Not due to the difficulty, Kil'Jaeden and Kael'thas are perfect examples of fun yet very challenging encounters)<br />
2. You seem to be suggesting that the first wotlk instances should have carried on difficulty wise where Sunwell left off, well guess what, they tried this before in TBC. AND IT WAS HORRIBLE. <br />
You had a massively overtuned Gruul who ended up having to be cheesed with flasks of petrification for early kills, you had a Magtheridon that was even worse and was only killed by around 5 guilds until he was nerfed. (And Magtheridon v2 was still likely too hard for its place in the content chain), a double resistance check at the start of SSC, a massive &quot;lol u lose&quot; encounter in Leotheras that was harder than most original Naxx bosses, complete with 45 minute trash respawns, oh and an unkillable kael'thas and a practically unkillable Lady Vashj.<br />
If you think tuning super hard raid content on the first wave of instances in the expansion is a good idea then you're delusional, it's difficult enough to tune stuff for the legion of whining kids who don't want those filthy casuals getting their precious purple items, let alone do it when they have to take into account the impact of 10 new levels, an entire new class, the relitively unknown strength of level 80 blues and heroic purps, and numerous new talents and abilities.

<br />
<br />
You mean the Chinese farmer share an account system? I don't think Blizzard is quite stupid enough to do that again.<br />
<br />
The problem I have realistically is that raiding is not hard. They can claim that Uludar will be hard and blah blah blah but it won't be. Anyone that can get out of void zones and can move away from fire walls can currently pretty much excel in raiding. I die much more on my class in PvP than I ever do in raiding. Its nothing more than a time sink. They say they want BGs to be about individual skill when raiding clearly isn't. That same person that dies in the first void zone wins the 226 item from 2 drakes and all raiding is about is your commitment to take time to raid. The same should be true about PvP. If you are willing to sink 8 hours a week into PvP you should get 1-2 decent items from doing so just like you will in raiding. Blizzard needs to realize how stupid they sound when they try to say that raiding (even back in the old days) takes skill and that the same skill should be measured in BGs.</div></div><hr />

If it wasn't for the gate system, sunwell would have been cleared by a good chunk of the top guilds within 2 weeks, and by the remainder of the top guilds within 3. And M'uru v1 was about as fun as hammering nails into your testicles. (Not due to the difficulty, Kil'Jaeden and Kael'thas are perfect examples of fun yet very challenging encounters)<br />
2. You seem to be suggesting that the first wotlk instances should have carried on difficulty wise where Sunwell left off, well guess what, they tried this before in TBC. AND IT WAS HORRIBLE. <br />
You had a massively overtuned Gruul who ended up having to be cheesed with flasks of petrification for early kills, you had a Magtheridon that was even worse and was only killed by around 5 guilds until he was nerfed. (And Magtheridon v2 was still likely too hard for its place in the content chain), a double resistance check at the start of SSC, a massive &quot;lol u lose&quot; encounter in Leotheras that was harder than most original Naxx bosses, complete with 45 minute trash respawns, oh and an unkillable kael'thas and a practically unkillable Lady Vashj.<br />

On one hand you say Sunwell was too easy and would of been cleared in 3 weeks by all guilds, if it hadnt of been for the gates, on the other hand you imply Muru was too hard? Make yer mind up<br />
<br />
I said by all the top guilds, not by all guilds. Also I stated that M'uru was a horrible combination of difficulty and mind numbing tedium, not that it was &quot;too hard&quot;. The point is that tuning content with the top guilds in mind is pointless because anything short of impossible will be devoured quickly regardless, people in general are better at the game than they were 4 years ago. (An instance like Naxx today would have been considered impossibly hard in the days of Molten Core)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Sunwell learnign curve was almost perfect. All except for Muru which i DO think was just a bit too hard. I think youll find nearly everyone will agree that it was tuned just about right and that everyone had fun. Farming an easy Naxx in WoTLK is about as boring as the game has ever been. In fact it IS the most boring the game has ever been. Try arguing with that sentence and see how many people agree<br />
Sunwell learning curve was fine for the top 2-3% of guilds out there, which I suppose isn't too much of an issue for the last raid instance of the expansion, but to state that &quot;everyone had fun&quot; shows a massive disconnection from reality. You might not be aware of it, but blizzard don't like designing content that only a tiny fraction of their player base will ever see. Luckily thanks to 10 man progression and hard modes they can now start to cater to both casual players, hardcore players, and whiney malcontents, when they could just have easily kept everything fairly easy and still pleased the majority of their player base.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3) TBC problems with difficulty at the start wasnt a major concern. Fair enogh they was SLIGHTLY overtuned.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like somebody didn't try raiding 25 man content in 2.0, to state it was &quot;slightly overtuned&quot; is a complete lie, it was horribly overtuned and the game was in a far worse state prior to 2.1 than it is now prior to 3.1.</div></div><hr />

The reality is not many people are enjoying it because it is too easy and too boring.<br />
<br />
Are you really saying that the majority of people think WoTLK Naxxramus is better and more enjoyable than Sunwell was?<br />
<br />
I think youll find the answer to that is a big fat &quot;Hell NO they do not&quot;.<br />
<br />
Go and ask people that have raided both, i encourage you to. <br />
<br />
<br />
Straw man, say hello to ds_swooshie, ds_swooshie, say hello to straw man. Talk about fictitious situations in arguments... 'If you ask the 3% of players who were hardcore enough to clear Sunwell whether they prefer a hardcore raid or a raid tuned for the other 97% of players, you'll find that they prefer the hardcore raid'- well duh, brilliant proposition Einstein. Hardcore raiders enjoy hardcore content more than easy content? You don't say? 97% of players never saw SWP so they can't vote in your little straw man, which is the whole fucking point of entry level raiding in WOTLK- not turning off 97% of the community from raiding because you have to do dumbass things like tell your Mage mate he isn't invited because his DPS has statistically been shown to be 2.3% lower than the Warlocks you're stacking (or whatever).<br />
<br />
Those of us who only raid a couple of times a week for social reasons are quite happy that entry level raiding in WOTLK hasn't been ball-curlingly difficult. It gives us an opportunity to, y'know, crack a beer, have a chat, tell jokes, have raid members go and put their kids to bed. You should try a bit of interpersonal interaction in raids- personally I prefer that to sitting silently in a darkened room sweating my ass off in case I make one tiny mistake and kill the entire raid. You'll have your hardcore jollies in Ulduar with hard modes and Algalon, and we'll all bow before you when you stroll through Dalaran in your Algalon epics, just do us all a fucking favour and spare us the elitist 'nobody who isn't as leet as me should be allowed into end game raiding' bullshit.

<br />
But you're completely right, all the people causing the instance servers to fall over at the moment because they're doing Naxx by the thousands were totally inspired to do so by a raid instance they've never seen that they heard they shouldn't even attempt because it was so super hard only the pros could do it. Your logic is infallible, and I must bow to your superior intellect.<br />

<br />
Naxx being puggable is fine and really inevitable. The problem was that Naxx 25 was so easy compared to 10, that 10 felt like a pointless exercise. Ulduar 25 will not be as pug friendly as Naxx. I suspect it will be pugged at some point, but it may take longer. Don't forget that many guilds already knew the Naxx encounters very well when LK shipped. <br />
<br />
And to think they tried to say the reason was because only 5% of people had ever seen naxx...LAWL...gotta love the truth that 90% of players saw naxx at 70 and knew everything about it and they just wanted to reuse old crap to not have to hire people to create new content thus pocketing more money.</div></div><hr />

So naxx is easy mode right? Well it wasnt truely easy at level 60 learning the fights... 4 horsemen, and some others were pretty intense back then... I seen your post saying most seen naxx at 70?? Only the bored people went in naxx at 70, people who didnt get to see it at 60...<br />
<br />
Hell id like to see blizzard make a herioc/hard mode of the old 40 man raids, MC, BWL, and AQ40.... Along with all the old dungeons.... 5 man UBRS on level 80 heroic mode would probably be fun... Hell back in the day doing it with 10-15 people was a rush before MC gear was the big thing.... &quot;This is of course only if they are adding new content&quot; <br />
<br />
Content will come and go, as long as they bring in new stuff why not reuse some of the old?<br />
<br />
Would be interesting to see if guilds would get caught up on a heroic mode of bwl vael for a few days/weeks... <br />
<br />
So you can pull your numbers etc, saying x amount raids and y this, z that... Nobody cares... If you cant enjoy the game find something new, the rest of us will continue playing and bsing with our friends...<br />

You are one bitter mage dude.<br />
<br />
On topic though, the &quot;3%&quot; of people who used to raid, have you ever thought that these &quot;3%&quot; were the only people actually interested in raiding.<br />
<br />
The other &quot;97%&quot; figure is nonsense.<br />
<br />
Currently there are around 12 million Warcraft subscribers, and 56,000 guilds.<br />
Lets assume they are all 25 man (just to show you im being absolutely fair, a very large proportion of these guilds wont even be raiders or even 25 man anyway)<br />
<br />
56000*25 = 1.4 million raiders (the true figure is likely to be less than half of this)<br />
<br />
That means as an absolute MAXIMUM there are around 8% of subscribers who actually raid (true figue if we half this of around 4%)<br />
<br />
<br />
Gz, Blizzard has gained between 1% and 5% of extra raiders since Sunwell.<br />
<br />
Im willing to bet that most of these were interested in raiding BECAUSE of sunwell, and many will actually STOP BECAUSE of Naxx, (mostly the people who find it easy and are bored of the game) and Ulduar (if that turns out to be just as easy).<br />
<br />
Try not to pull &quot;97%&quot; figure out your **** before you actually know what it is your quoting ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
So with all your numbers (which are obviously based on faulty assumptions each way - not all guilds raid and those that do raid have more than 25 members that raid), you are claiming that only 1-5% more people raid Naxx than sunwell? I don't know where the number people are quoting are coming from but the claim that only 1-5% more people naxx vs. sunwell is obviously false.<br />
<br />
Really you seem to be the bitter one based on your posts. <br />
<br />
As far as new content blizzard is catering to those that don't raid also. Yes the amount of brand new raid content in 3.0 is limited but there was also 10 new levels, achievements, a new continent, and new 5 mans. Of course to hard core raiders most of that is irrelevant but it took some time to program.</div></div><hr />

LoL. If you want to talk about realism here. A Hunter IRL does not put a trap underneath an animal while he just sits there does he? Its fail in a way that as a Ranged class that cannot do much in melee range has to put a trap in melee range in order to make it trigget, both fail in raid and arena pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I never said that the PvP aspect of SV wasnt nerfed to the ground, it is, but still viable, way more then it was in TBC atleast.<br />
And srsly, when your talking dmg, its PvE thats the benchmark, not PvP.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buffwhite</div><div class="date">2009-03-31, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, to the dude that talked about Surv hunters getting overnerfed and MM being the new spec to go for pve. You cannot have a pure dps spec that is hands down the best pvp AND pve spec. Right now, that's what Surv is on live. Sorry, that gets you nerfed (in one or the other). <br />
<br />
But look at it this way. MM was always the &quot;kite&quot; spec. We have weak defense vs. melee, our pet is almost useless and our survival is the lowest of all 3 trees. If an MM hunt can't beat a Surv hunt in &quot;survival&quot; *the best thing for pvp*, why should we be also outmatched in all other aspects. IMO they are just bringing those trees into the balance they should've had before (one being better in pvp, surv, and one being better now in pve, mm). BM is however screwed as of yet, being number 3, but I think Blizz is content with BM being behind the other two &quot;for now&quot; (until they fix it) as it was the best spec for TBC. BM's got the &quot;oh shit. you can't touch this&quot; button, Surv has the best traps, melee, crit, ap, life and overall survivability and as of late, the best dps as well. Before the nerfs, there was absolutely no reason to go MM. None... Now they have given meaning to an obsolete spec. It's called balance.<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
<br />
A class/spec being underpowered does not justify allowing them to be overpowered for any period of time after that.</div></div><hr />

Killing last boss from 10 ppl Ulduar will grant all the players in that raid an attunement that will unlock the 25 ppl version. And same for the 25 ppl raids, will unlock the 10 ppl version. So the purpose will be to not be able to do both 25 ppl and 10 ppl version in a week, unless you already finished the instance and will unlock the possibility to do both in the same week. This will prevent in some way 25 ppl GM to not do like 1 2 weeks Ulduar 10 man, as it will blow out the feeling of the new bosses. Finishing again 10 ppl version of the Ulduar normal just because gm asks me to even if I don't want it, and after that not having any fun doing the 25 ppl version is not nice. Any other idea about blocking 25 ppl raiders from doing 10 ppl instances to &quot;learn&quot; the encounters, is welcomed. My idea helps but is not solving the problem. But indeed got some advantages:<br />
1. gm won't be tempted to go 10 ppl raids beacuse ppl get saved and won;t be able to go 25 in the same week.<br />
2. once they start the 25 ppl version they will be more willing to finish it to get the attunement for doing both in the same week.<br />
3. once they got attuned, means that the instance is in farming mode at some level, and they will have time for 10 ppl version. Allowing 10 ppl version before finishing the 25 ppl one, is kind of useless as ppl won;t have time for it annyway.<br />
<br />
Well, you might say &quot;find another guild&quot;, is not the case. <br />
I am new in this guild, can't convince them to don't do 10 ppl Ulduar for 1 2 weeks before starting the 25 ppl one. And otherwise is a nice guild, I likle most ppl in it, and they are good players. So come up with a real solution, not an advice that would solve my problem in some way. <br />
My intentions are to somehow come up with something that Blizzard will be tempted to implement in order to keep the &quot;first kill&quot; feeling as it should be: &quot;hard and rewarding&quot;.</div></div><hr />

In TBC the content was only &quot;ball-curlingly difficult&quot; when it was first brought out. That gave a chance for the hardcore players to smack their heads against a wall. At the same times there was enough challenge in normal and heroic dungeons to keep the &quot;couple of times a week, social&quot; players happy.

You have no idea what drives the hardcore players. I never met one who gave a sh*t about what you thought of their epics or what content you were doing. Serious raiders were too busy worrying about their own progress.<br />
<br />
My 3-raids / week guild that did everything from Kara to Sunwell in TBC has been reduced to 1-raid / week guild for months now simply because that's how long it takes to clear all the 25-man raid content. Is it really too much to ask to have enough raid content for 3 nights per week and some content to progress in? Everybody does not get to play in the current system.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spacelord</div><div class="date">2009-03-31, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not that my personal experience really supports either argument, but I reactivated my account and levelled a new character to play with a RL friend who started a guild for the sole purpose of casually running 10 mans.<br />
<br />
I raided all of the 40 mans back in the vanilla wow days, especially over the summer of 2006, and it took a lot out of me. During summer break I would rush home after working 10 hour days in a warehouse to jump on my computer so we could hit up AQ40 or whatever we were doing at the time. I eventually got fed up with how much time I was spending on the game and quit for quite some time.<br />
<br />
When I heard that Wrath would introduce raids in a 10-man format I was pretty excited, especially after my RL buddy told me his plans for the guild. Right now I'm in my 4th year of college, I have friends and a girlfriend to take up a lot of my time, and I'm pretty satisfied with the amount of time I currently invest in wow on a weekly basis. <br />
<br />
I would guess that a lot of the playerbase or at least raiding playerbase is in a similar situation as I am - with priorities in RL that wouldn't have allowed them to participate in things like SWP. I certainly never set foot in SWP. <br />
<br />
So I guess the point is that I enjoy the 10 man stuff, as easy as it might be, because it lets me experience Wrath content without wow sucking my time dry.</div></div><hr />

Killing last boss from 10 ppl Ulduar will grant all the players in that raid an attunement that will unlock the 25 ppl version.<br />
<br />
<br />
So... it will take guilds AT THE VERY LEAST three weeks to be able to access 25 man content after its release? I don't think so....</div></div><hr />

A Hunter IRL does not put a trap underneath an animal while he just sits there does he? Its fail in a way that as a Ranged class that cannot do much in melee range has to put a trap in melee range in order to make it trigget, both fail in raid and arena pvp.<br />
<br />
<br />
When did I talk about realism? We were talking about game design. You said it was faulty, I disagree, for where they want hunters to be, the traps seem to fit. What doesn't make sense is &quot;Oh! Big ?? Boss! I'm going to launch my trap at it&quot; What? How does that even make sense in game design? Next you'll want to shoot magic laser arrows from your cannon of infinite arrows (cough ok so that was a cool legendary bow..)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">neoqpa</div><div class="date">2009-03-31, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as for vanish breaking, couldnt they, for example , make and animation that lasts , lets say 1 sec, and you vanish after that? eg, rogue creating mirror images and then throwing the smoke bomb (of course the images would also dissapead), or sth like killing spree effect. during that 1 sec rogues would still take dmg (-50% possibily?) and it would give time needed for the server to prepare rogue for being stealthed, thus untargetable. it wont be perfect, cause you would still take dmg for some time, but at least you will be aware of that.<br />
<br />
just a random idea while thinking bout that vanish bug.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunatly your wrong, and thats not where they want hunter to be. Hence we get Trap Laucher, which is currently under development. You keep talking about PVE, im talking about PVP. Every ranged class has a ranged CC superior then that of a Hunters (after 3.1 at least). Why would shooting a trap make less sense then spamming sheep, casting fears, etc etc.<br />
<br />
What doesnt make sense is the fact that Hunters have the need to be at a sertain range from a target to deal dmg, but yet has to put himself in a vulnerable position (melee) to place a trap. For your info, traps arent only to kite players to gain range, its also the biggest source of dmg increase for survival specced Hunters.<br />
How many DPS classes have to put themselves in harms way to increase their dmg? Trap Launcher will help out Hunters (especially PVP) and is very much needed after the nerfs to stuns,roots and wyvern stings in 3.1.</div></div><hr />
