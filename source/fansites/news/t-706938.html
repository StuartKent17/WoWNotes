We wanted to introduce some of the changes to dispel mechanics coming in Cataclysm. Our goals were to make dispelling a little less trivial to do in PvP, and to make sure there is more equity in dispel capabilities among healers in both PvP and PvE.<br />
<br />
Within the system, there are currently five types of dispellable (or curable) buffs and debuffs: curse, disease, poison, defensive magic, and offensive magic. An example of defensive magic dispelling would be using a dispel to free a polymorphed ally, while offensive magic dispelling would be utilizing a dispel ability to strip away an enemy’s buff or heal-over-time (HoT) spell. The main distinction between these two types is in whether or not you can target an enemy with your dispel.<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm each healing class will be getting three out of the five types of dispels, with one of these always being a defensive dispel magic. This design makes sure that finding a healer with the ability to remove magic isn’t restrictive in building teams for Arenas or rated Battlegrounds. It also allows the encounter designers to assume, when designing dungeon or raid fights, that every group can dispel magic.<br />
<br />
In addition, we're making the opportunity cost (what the player could have accomplished with different actions) for dispelling a bit steeper. We think the cost is too low for three reasons: 1) The actual mana cost is low. 2) You never waste a dispel. If you try to dispel a debuff that isn’t there then the dispel just won’t go off. 3) We have spells that remove debuffs with minimal input on the part of the player. In Cataclysm we are raising the mana costs, making it possible to waste mana by casting a dispel when there is nothing to dispel, and removing Cleansing Totem, Abolish Disease, and Abolish Poison from the game. With these changes in mind, we are working to plan dungeon and raid encounters where dispels aren’t in constant demand or spammed in order to be successful, though some need for dispels will still be a part of the design.<br />
<br />
As previously mentioned, we are providing three dispel capabilities to all healing classes as follows:<br />
<br />
Druids will be able to dispel defensive magic, curses, and poison.<br />
Paladins will be able to dispel defensive magic, diseases, and poison.<br />
Priests will be able to dispel defensive magic, offensive magic, and disease.<br />
Shaman will be able to dispel defensive magic, offensive magic, and curses.<br />
<br />
There is some trade-off that is being made in making these changes and we wanted to expand on this further.<br />
<br />
Protection and Retribution paladins will lose their current ability to dispel magic.<br />
All shaman will lose dispel disease and dispel poison in exchange for Restoration gaining dispel magic.<br />
Restoration shaman, Restoration druids, and Holy paladins will need to talent into their defensive magic dispels.<br />
Shadow priests won’t be able to remove disease in Shadowform.<br />
Mage, hunter, and warlock will retain their current dispel mechanics.<br />
Body and Soul remains the same, and basically any dispel mechanic not mentioned above is currently planned to remain as it is.<br />
When possible, we’d like to combine dispels into a single action. For example, the druid ability to dispel curses and poisons might be a single spell with a Restoration talent that also allows it to dispel magic. This part of the design isn’t finalized, however.<br />
<br />
As with all of our Cataclysm previews, keep in mind that any of these decisions could change when we’re in beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But seriously. It's a stupid change and hopefully blizzard will be able to see the ramifications that are certain to arise in pvp. <br />
<br />
Druids benefiting the most from this while shaman are in the middle with the fire and forget changes to their totems. Priests and Pallies will certainly lag behind druids now without some form of compensation for their loss.</div></div><hr />

Depspelling magic and poison and curses in one spell for a druid will cause lots of problems with things like UA...<br />

Druids need a dispell... WTF-, seriously do they need anything more? They lost nothing and gained an ability, this is just ridiculous, they will be beyond overpowered...<br />
Shaman loosing poison and disease removal AND the totem, woah WOAH... what are they now, like the worst healer both pve and pvp wise?- and btw, ele and enhancement shaman will cease to exist in pvp, and so will retribution and protribution paladins...<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, huge buff for DKs and rogues...<br />
<br />
idd we all know that rogues pounce on enhance shammies as it is now<br />
rofl @ this change seems no real thought has gone into this from a pvp point of view</div></div><hr />

*MASSIVE QQ HERE*<br />
<br />
I mean really, What The Fuck?!?<br />
<br />
We're losing the ability to get rid of poisons AND diseases?<br />
<br />
I really want to know the justification for this one.<br />
<br />
PvE wise - I honestly think we were fine being able to get rid of poisons and diseases, able to purge but couldn't dispel magic.<br />
<br />
In PvP - OH HAI MR ROGUE COME POISON ME PLS I CAN'T DO ANYTHING NOW OH LOLS WOUND POISON AND CRIPPLING POISON IM DEAD OH NOES. Really, what is the point? <br />
<br />
Things were fine, this really seems like a 'fix it til its broken' thing.<br />

I'd love to QQ more but I feel I should probably do some form of work today.</div></div><hr />

While I see the reasoning for it, I think it's a bad move. It's one of those things that differs a great tank from a good tank.</div></div><hr />

Because all of us elemental and enhancment shamans are gonna be happy about this one..... &gt;:(<br />
<br />
And really no more cleansing totem....well i dont forsee us getting a totem to compensate for that loss of utility <br />
<br />
No matter how much they say it isnt true this is based upon pvp change...we are even more of a free honor kill now with no ability to remove poisons and diseases \o/</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will say though that I think with the way things look, druids will completely dominate face. The only interesting point I would make is whether or not they will allow a dispel mechanic to occur from a druid in tree form or only human. I think allowing it in only human would be interesting.<br />
<br />
Secondly, they said that classes must TALENT into defensive dispel mechanics. So what I'm thinking is that it's probably NOT going to be at the very bottom of the holy or resto tree. So that probably means that other specs of paladins and shamans will most likely have access to that ability. Makes sense to me.<br />
<br />
We'll get 76 points to decide on what to do with. I'm thinking that ret paladins and offensive shaman specs are going to be ok.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">irdo</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dispel defensive magic could be around 21 Points in Paladin's Holy Tree, which would make it accessible for Retri Paladins in PvP. <br />
Sounds like a fair decision, as you have to choose between a defensive role (Dispel Magic - Holy) and an offensive one (lower Stun CD).<br />
Otherwise it would be a huge nerf to Ret PvP which would probably be equalized by giving us some sort of gap closer. The latter would be neat, too, but I actually prefer defensive utility.</div></div><hr />

The game will be totally different come cataclysm wouldn't jump to conclusions so fast.</div></div><hr />

They basically want healers to waste Dispels? Wonderful!<br />
<br />
<br />
The idea is, You will get punished for just spamming dispel to get rid of everything. Basically punished for playing mindlessly.<br />
<br />
Which is one of the main reasons why people don't like world of warcraft. Some people think it's completely mindless, so they are doing what they can to better reward people with actual reflexes (without causing the entire game to collapse onto itself).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, i am going to miss the ability to dispel magic effects (which i don't see enough of, even by people who don't do it), but i too understand the reasoning behind it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids are going to get hit hard by this as well with multiple classes being able to stip hots off targets. I mean honestly how many of you play pvp and arena that much. This is just redefining roles and trying to push players to adapt. In all honesty people need to chill and see what happens before freaking out to a blue post.</div></div><hr />

Druids wont be removing warlock DoTs from themselves or their team mates (CoA excepted, cause its a curse) cause those are Offensive magics... and we cant do that. I read this change as a 'we want to have the bosses buff themselves, and make the healers remove them... to give 'em something else ta do yanno'<br />

They already don't dispel in PvE and the suck horribly in PvP to a point, nearly every PvP paladin is healer or some form of prot.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You mean those shamans with no Defensive CDs, those shamans who have one of the lowest health pools in the game considering they wear mail and have no defensive CDs, those shamans whose ability to remove diseases was in the form of an easily targeted and easily destroyed totem along with the rest of their buffs...<br />
<br />
there is a reason why shamans can kite (very argueably) better than most classes, its because when shit hits the fan shamans can't bubble or pop a shield or remove themselves from combat or invis or get a massive damage reduction...we have to run away...its such a great benefit you know, having to run from anything that threatens you (every other class) instead of staying and fighting...<br />
<br />
<br />
as for the changes it doesn't make much difference in PvP Shamans didn't stand a chance against DKs after unholy blight and thanks to no defense and low health rogues already raped us...now i know i don't have to waste time dropping cleansing totem before they kill me anymore really...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dannax</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think these changes should be interesting. I have a holy paladin, resto druid/shaman and I think it'll make it more challenging and take more thought when using their dispel abilities. Sure, some classes will hurt but I don't think it should cripple anything. I'm sure it gets annoying for other people when all some classes do in an arena is spam dispel so those people will rejoice because now it's going to drain their mana.<br />
<br />
I imagine alot of the QQ is coming from people who do just that, spam dispel and win because they can't win just from dispelling dots or dispelling a priest from all of their protection. I think this is a way to make people play more efficiently. If you can't win an arena match w/o being able to dispel, then you should work at trying to play better and with more skill.<br />
<br />
It's impossible to please 11 million people... and people are never happy with anything Blizzard does unless it means your class is buffed and overpowered beyond belief or the people who get roflpwned by those classes rejoice because they may stand a chance because certain things get nerfed. It amazes me how so many people take these changes as the final product. I guess reading comprehension wasn't a big thing in many schools. Missing key statements as &quot;things may change during beta and nothing is final until it goes live&quot; are completely ignored.<br />
<br />
Stop whining, embrace change. Learn how to do more than spam dispels. If you're always saying how L33T you are then show it but not relying on things like this or just reroll so you always feel as tho you're overpowered and don't have to make any effort to win.<br />
<br />
I'm also really sick of changes always revolving around PVP. I really like PVP and I only arena in 2s and I've gotten to 2200 in the past as Demo lock/BM hunter. An unlikely setup but possible if you just play around and learn how to play. I sometimes wish PVP changes were restricted to PVP servers and PVE was left alone and allowed to revolve around end-game rather than a bunch of fanboi's QQing because they can't beat a certain comp, either because of skill or just because &quot;MAH CLASS CANT KILL THIS GUY BECAUSE HE IS OVERPOWERED NERFNERFNERF KTHXBAI&quot;<br />
<br />
I think some people should take a step back and look at the big picture. As if Ret or Prot needed anything else. You have a bubble that makes you immune to everything except a priest and their mass dispel. Not to mention you can heal yourself and still attack during the time the bubble is active. Sure, they may not be full powered but it still works. Just sit back, relax and wait until it goes live. If you're still soo unhappy stop playing. You don't have to pay $15 a month if you're that unhappy. <br />
<br />
This isn't directed to everyone who is complaining, just those who are mindlessly QQing over nothing. Evolve, gain some skill and don't pass judgement until it goes live. I await the flaming and those yelling at me for TL;dr but oh well... I had to say something and I did.</div></div><hr />

Druids wont be removing warlock DoTs from themselves or their team mates (CoA excepted, cause its a curse) cause those are Offensive magics... and we cant do that. I read this change as a 'we want to have the bosses buff themselves, and make the healers remove them... to give 'em something else ta do yanno'<br />

From the front post: &quot;An example of defensive magic dispelling would be using a dispel to free a polymorphed ally, while offensive magic dispelling would be utilizing a dispel ability to strip away an enemy’s buff or heal-over-time (HoT) spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, you've got your definitions of Defensive dispels and Offensive dispels a little backwards.</div></div><hr />

I am really pissed right now. But since nothing is final I'll wait on further changes. But they better be good. <br />
<br />
Every shaman is already fucked up against rogues, with no poison removal it's game over. Element and especially enha are dead in pvp, with this change and if it stays the same, say bye bye to shaman pvp. They better add a good defensive totem for us now, not the glyphed shit. <br />
<br />
And now druids can dispel magic while staying immune to poly/hex and having a auto CC. Awesome ::)<br />
<br />
The only classes benefit from these changes are rogues and druids (DK's to some extent). Who didn't see that coming!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marrilaife</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is another sad example &quot;how pvp ruins pve&quot;. <br />
<br />
All we hear about dispels is &quot;being able to dispel sheep from arena partner yadda yadda&quot;. <br />
<br />
It's goddamn not all about pvp! <br />
<br />
In pve, what distinguishes good dps from mindless recount-worshipper is that good dps has decursive and dispels. Now they're gonna take it away, non-holy Paladins can't dispel, Shadow Priests can't cure diseases etc. etc. <br />
<br />
So basically they're gonna laugh at us &quot;lol it's healer's duty&quot;, and if the &lt;b&gt;healer&lt;/b&gt; is disabled by some debuff (usually magic, but now for example in POS there's cc which is poison), you're screwed. <br />
<br />
Being able to put some dispel duties on dps to free up gcd for healers and let them heal more, as opposed to put them only on healers and let dps pew pew more was a decision that will be taken away from us. <br />
<br />
PVE can be very imbalanced when you suddenly can't remove a debuff, you remember start of wotlk, how hard had priests to heal azjol nerub, old kingdom and through some scourge waves in cot (poison which damages for 75% of max HP of tank), while other classes had it much easier, remove poison and done. <br />
<br />
Also Paladin tanks losing cleanse?? <br />
Maybe at least they finally give Paladins proper spell interrupt like shield bash or mind freeze? They're stripping Paladin tanks from their abilities (flash of light HOT being holy only, lay on hands causing forbearance, and now cleanse only for holy?) while they still don't have as many utility spells as warrior tanks. They have stun, but warriors have 2. Warriors also have charge, intervene, shield bash, spell reflect, disarm... And of course they still cry how they deserve more buffs than Paladins and Death Knights because they have &quot;tanking legacy&quot;. <br />
<br />
End line: in my opinion, they shouldn't remove dispel abilities from non-healers. If they cry over pvp, just make some spells unusable in arena (and allow only weaker versions).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caerdwyn</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My biggest issue with there being a higher penalty is simply that sometimes you go to dispel something and a. It has worn off; or b. Someone beat you to it by half a second. My biggest question is: How are Blizzard going to account for those situations?<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
Ice Shot in Halls of Reflection lasts for a mere 2 secs, but often I won't take time to see just what the debuff is, but will simply dispel it; finding that it is no longer there because I waited for my Flash Heal to finish casting and by that time it has dispelled itself. Perhaps all dispellable debuffs will last for a good period of time, so that it is always worth dispelling. But what about Frostbolt? I sometimes find myself dispelling a Frostbolt debuff only to ask myself what the point was...<br />
<br />
The second example is that sometimes I will go to decurse on my mage and find that a druid has already removed the curse - or go to remove a magic debuff with my priest and find that the paladin tank has already removed it within half a second of its application. Perhaps leaving dispelling up to particular healers will work out a lot more efficiently with the changes.</div></div><hr />

Wow, I would definitely post this in the suggestion forum for one of the blues. This is really a brilliant idea.

<br />
All classes needed a magic dispel, not because of PvP, but there are many magic debuffs that go out in PvE content that only Pally and Priest could dispel.<br />
<br />
And why are Ret Pallies complaining that they can no longer dispel magic? I rarely see dps classes that care about dispelling over damage meters. Pallies need to L2P and use those Cleanses and Hand spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizz is always talking about bring the player, not the class nonsense.<br />
<br />
Well let's look at this for a moment...<br />
<br />
How's a 10 man group with no pally or priest healer going to kill LK with these changes? With this change you have no choice...you bring one or the other or you don't clear phase 1. What about Rotface? At least on that one the disease drops off. Fights like Yogg on 10 man? 3 differant healer classes or your boned.<br />
<br />
I realize 10 man isn't everyone's focus, but for a huge amount of the player base out there, 10 man is all they can do. These changes are going to force those guilds to spread out recruitment to ensure they bring the class for any encounter with debuffs, rather then bringing the player...a complete counter to your supposed mission goal. This is a pretty damn big problem as a big reason a lot of 10 man guilds never make it to 25 is recruitment issues. I realize the fights above are all very specific encounters from WotLK, not Cata...and I suppose you could homogenize every single imperative boss debuff to being magic. Honestly though...what the hell kinda fun is that?<br />
<br />
I do think it'll be funny when a 10 man raid of level 85s in full tier 13 gear with 2 resto shaman healers won't even be able to get past phase 1 of the Lich King without losing people to Necrotic Plague. <br />
<br />
Hope there is more to this change then is being stated...because as it is now...it's seems like yet another pathetic pvp nerf that carries over into pve...AGAIN.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palladiamors</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reading comprehension is your friend. Protection and Retribution are losing the ability to dispel MAGIC debuffs, but not poison or disease.<br />
<br />
Shaman are losing poison and disease, but are gaining magic dispel, because they currently have four of the five dispel categories, only being unable to dispel defensive magic. Course you'd think they'd keep poison or disease instead of gaining magic and losing both, but eh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This, so much. As a shadowpriest I often find my ability to remove disease to be invaluable, especially in groups with less skilled healers, as I'm pretty observant player and notice it long before they do. <br />
<br />
Removal of this puts more on the healers and takes away tools from skilled, observant dps to help out the raid.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, do you not think Blizzard are designing the new encounters with these changes in mind? Yes, thats right, most fights will no longer rely on dispels and focus on other stuff instead.<br />
<br />
And if you're still upset because you think it wont be possible to go back to LK at level 85 and kill him, then you're more retarded than I thought. Are you seriosly more concerned about how you will tackle old content as opposed to embracing the new?<br />
<br />
It baffles me how people moan about every single change that they announce because if you ask me, Blizzard have done pretty well so far and seem to know what they're doing. If you disagree then you are a liar because you wouldnt be posting on these forums and playing the game every day.<br />

And if you're still upset because you think it wont be possible to go back to LK at level 85 and kill him, then you're more retarded than I thought. Are you seriosly more concerned about how you will tackle old content as opposed to embracing the new?<br />
<br />
It baffles me how people moan about every single change that they announce because if you ask me, Blizzard have done pretty well so far and seem to know what they're doing. If you disagree then you are a liar because you wouldnt be posting on these forums and playing the game every day.<br />
<br />
Jesus christ.<br />
<br />
<br />
The point I was making...which you might have seen had you read the post instead of pulling out your troll stick, is that by limiting which dispells classes bring so severely, then any encounter that requires you to dispell a disease will require specific classes, which will impact 10 man raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
I also stated, which again you missed, as your only purpose to posting was to flame instead of think, that the only counter to this would be to homogenize every single encounter involving debuffs to contain only magic debuffs.<br />
<br />
Now, I've been raiding since vanilla, and a core mechanic to EVERY SINGLE raid in this game has been debuffs and dispells so I'm going to throw it out there that they won't be changing that. My concern is that every single debuff will be magic..which is boring as hell (especially in 25s), or that they will continue their current setup, which will make certain classes inept for 10 man raids. This is not something that effects me a lot, as I primarily run 25s, but I'd venture to guess that the majority of the player base are running 10s. <br />
<br />
Yes, Blizzard knows what they are doing, but they are also human, and make mistakes as often as they do well...hence my concerns.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tang</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">See, here's my issue with what I see.<br />
<br />
Blizz is always talking about bring the player, not the class nonsense.<br />
<br />
Well let's look at this for a moment...<br />
<br />
How's a 10 man group with no pally or priest healer going to kill LK with these changes? With this change you have no choice...you bring one or the other or you don't clear phase 1. What about Rotface? At least on that one the disease drops off. Fights like Yogg on 10 man? 3 differant healer classes or your boned.<br />
<br />
I realize 10 man isn't everyone's focus, but for a huge amount of the player base out there, 10 man is all they can do. These changes are going to force those guilds to spread out recruitment to ensure they bring the class for any encounter with debuffs, rather then bringing the player...a complete counter to your supposed mission goal. This is a pretty damn big problem as a big reason a lot of 10 man guilds never make it to 25 is recruitment issues. I realize the fights above are all very specific encounters from WotLK, not Cata...and I suppose you could homogenize every single imperative boss debuff to being magic. Honestly though...what the hell kinda fun is that?<br />
<br />
I do think it'll be funny when a 10 man raid of level 85s in full tier 13 gear with 2 resto shaman healers won't even be able to get past phase 1 of the Lich King without losing people to Necrotic Plague. <br />
<br />
Hope there is more to this change then is being stated...because as it is now...it's seems like yet another pathetic pvp nerf that carries over into pve...AGAIN.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the time these changes go live, no one will really care about ICC except to grab any last minute loot before Cataclysm goes live.<br />
<br />
It's likely that 10 man encounters in Cata will either not require disease/poison/curse/offensive dispels, or alternative means will be provided in case you don't have the required personnel.<br />
<br />
Think about Intructor Razuvious in 10 man mode. You don't need a single priest, whereas in 25 man you pretty much need at least 2, and 4 is ideal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And they just announced the way dispelling gonna work, they havent say what they gonna do to rogue poisons and other debuffs that stack... which im guessing the gonna do something about it...<br />
<br />
Can't you all just wait until you actually know something before complaining like a little girl?<br />
<br />
<br />
It's fairly straightforward. They're going to remove the abilities and make us train for them in a specific tree. Similar to what they did to spiritual attunement for prot in Wrath. It's a PvP nerf with PvE implications, something Blizzard at least claims to not try to do. Of course they included that they would design PvE content around this nerf so now I'm wondering what exactly they'll do to replace it. It seems removing a possible major component of raiding due to PvP is a fucking high crime for most of us.<br />
<br />
I'm starting to get tired of the changes to simplify the game that aren't really simplifying anything. The list is growing:<br />
<br />
- Removing defense as a stat. Then adding crit reduction talents into all tanking trees. Now you're all required to spend points for that talent to get around a boss mechanic. How about just make bosses incapable of dealing crits? That would allow people to not have to spend points on required talents to get around stupid mechanics. Removing defense is a poorly hidden avoidance nerf.<br />
<br />
- Spirit for all healers. OK, that makes sense because we can change spirit to be active regen for all healers instead of stat that's only functioning out of combat and when not casting. Good idea making spirit work like mp5, except that's not what's happening. The solution? Meditation talents for all healers!!!! I'm starting to see a pattern here.<br />
<br />
- ArP being removed. The stat is too &quot;difficult&quot; apparently for the mind of the normal player. Not to mention the &quot;normal&quot; player will likely never reach the point where ArP vs non-ArP gemming matters but that's not the actual problem anyway (there's already other stats with moving caps such as hit for rogues and enhance shaman, Blizzard doesn't see a problem with this). The actual problem? ArP beneficial specs on average tend to perform better then non-ArP beneficial specs. Is this a problem because the stat is too good? No, not really, it may have more to do with the unacknowledged problem of ArP existing on aout 75% of melee dps gear. Hmmm, wonder why ArP specs do so well? Maybe because they have such a larger pool of gear to choose from, crazy idea I know.<br />
<br />
Anyone else seeing this nonsense or am I alone here?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkDude98</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From a PvE viewpoint this is both good and bad. It's good in the fact that certain players will have to focus more on dispelling and may even have to setup a specific person to dispell whatever in the fight more so than now. However it takes away the element of finding the &quot;best&quot; way to do certain encounters due to some classes/specs losing the ability to dispel.<br />
<br />
For example, one of the reasons I tank Rotface on my Paladin is my ability to remove the disease. As I'm the one kiting the big slime I'll know when to cleanse and such, whereas a Warrior Tank or whatever what have to rely on someone else to do this. With these changes, situations such as that may be harder to come by when it'll basically just be healers doing all the dispelling.<br />
<br />
And before anyone says anything, I know the rotface debuff is a disease and that it's old content, but my point is that it's things like that which make Raiding interesting to me, in that there's multiple ways to go about certain mechanics in an encounter. I feel that some of this will be lost with these changes but we'll have to wait and see what else is in store for us.</div></div><hr />

I can deal with loosing cleansing totem, but as someone who avoids pvp like the plague (a plague I can no longer dispell), counting offensive magic dispell as one of my three is a slap in the face. I can't think of a place for it in pve that isn't better served by a mage spell stealing. Leave us poison or disease, and if you're convinced we're only allowed 3 then leave the purging to dps who's targeting the baddies anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Offensive magic dispelling for shamans? Didn't we have Purge for that? And although it didn't pop over right at me, I was fine with how it worked regardless. <br />
I can see something useful in Defensive magic dispelling, but it's only for PvP. I doubt you'll enter a raid with 2-3 (10 man) shaman healers to heal yer behind?<br />
As for curses; nothing to QQ here! yay! <br />
<br />
In the end I don't like the trade-off, we're losing Cleansing Totem in favor for a PvP dispel and something we could've gone rid with using Purge? <br />
Being a long-time Shaman player, especially a Restoration one, I find these changes slightly hard 'like'. Oh, and I have to get used to the fact I'll be more of a priest, yay? (I know, they're subject to change) <br />
<br />
The entire 'wasting' mana on dispelling seems kind of retarded aswell.<br />
All with all I think Druids slip under this one just 'bout right. But giving them their dispel magic will make them pretty overpowerd in PvP or so is my guess, frankly I rarely play PvP so I might be wrong! <br />

QQ ends here! <br />

I'm getting really angry reading all the replies in this thread, people are looking at the PVE and PVP content of today and says how much this will ruin their class. While it's pretty darn obvious that with this Blizzard will balance around this and therefor not make any encounter where you have to spam dispel everyone, in PVP it will allow them to get rid if RNG dispell resistance talents due to healers not wanting to spam dispel themselves due to the high mana cost. This leads to you actually being able to dispell when you absolutely want to get rid of a debuff/buff instead of relying on RNG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard published the Cataclysm talent trees? Please feel free to share. The most I've seen stated about the new mana regen is that it's likely they're going to get rid of the FSR and just go into &quot;in combat&quot; and &quot;out of combat&quot; mana regen states. If you're rebuilding the whole mana regeneration system from the ground up then you have the room to make it work right from the start. I would be surprised to see Blizzard going to meditation talents in the new system, but it can't be ruled out. You certainly don't know if it's the case, though.<br />

<br />
<br />
Apparently you didn't get the message. ArP is a redundant stat that requires more math to resolve than AP. Both are stats that directly boost melee damage. They're just different mathematical formulas to get to the same end. In other words, ArP is a terrible design decision because it adds nothing to the game besides extra complexity. Complexity for its own sake is asinine and (to beat the horse) a TERRIBLE design decision. Just because you bothered to figure out ArP doesn't make the stat well thought out or worth keeping around.<br />
<br />
Given two solutions to the same problem, Blizzard has chosen the elegant one and opted to get rid of the overly complex one. This isn't rocket science. See spell power vs. spell healing and spell damage for a perfect example of this.<br />
<br />
<br />

I'm seeing a lot of nonsense from people who are resistant to change. You see it every time a new expansion gets towards beta in WoW.

Yes because these changes will be going live exactly as they are and there will be no other changes to any of the effected classes that may balance this, nor any changes to the PvP landscape at all that may put these changes in context, and certainly no changes to encounter design to accommodate this.</div></div><hr />

The changes to class systems in Cataclysm we've announced thus far are being proposed to make the game better, both in terms of PvP and PvE. Mind you, we have a host of changes planned for every class we plan to share in the future. Before providing overviews of our goals for each class though, we wanted to give you a look at some changes to more broad systems.<br />
<br />
While the feedback is welcomed, I'd caution players to consider this information with an open mind, rather than directly translating the proposed changes into the class systems of Wrath of the Lich King. <br />

No, they want healers to think about what they cast next - strategize more. How the game currently works, I fully agree with the Blizzard staff - something h&amp;#225;d to be changed.<br />

I believe they have already mentioned that they want poisons to remains a core part of the game, but be a lower amount of the rogue's damage, more coming from special attacks. <br />
<br />
Say, instead of being a poison, Crippling Poison effect was a special that requires combo point similar to Expose Armor? or Wound Poison? <br />
<br />
It would leave damage-dealing poisons, and then the healer would have the choice &quot;Should i dispel it, or try to heal through it?&quot;</div></div><hr />

This is a arena related change anyway. So they have to change dispell requirement in pve content too, with only healers being able to dispell magic. (And I doubt a dispell will cost 40% base mana..)</div></div><hr />

Seriously, do you not think Blizzard are designing the new encounters with these changes in mind? Yes, thats right, most fights will no longer rely on dispels and focus on other stuff instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've heard that line ever since Chromaggus was released. Then we had AQ40, then Naxxramas, then the lovely diseases in SSC that would jump around and flat out start one shotting people on trash packs because it stayed on someone for 0.5 seconds. You're deluded as hell if you think they're going to actually take that into consideration when tuning fights. Even after the &quot;destruction&quot; of oldskool Decursive they still designed some fights around ridiculous dispelling. (OG Naxx with a &quot;balanced&quot; raid was a problem, for example, then there's all the LOVELY dispelling opportunities in Hyjal and Sunwell).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And if you're still upset because you think it wont be possible to go back to LK at level 85 and kill him, then you're more retarded than I thought. Are you seriosly more concerned about how you will tackle old content as opposed to embracing the new?<br />
<br />
Careful there, Captain Ja'Koff! It's seriously, not seriosly. Perhaps if you spent more time in school paying attention to your studies (instead of trying to tell people on an internet forum that they're not allowed to worry about their game of choice) you might have caught that. EDUMAKASHUN!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It baffles me how people moan about every single change that they announce because if you ask me, Blizzard have done pretty well so far and seem to know what they're doing. If you disagree then you are a liar because you wouldnt be posting on these forums and playing the game every day.<br />
<br />
&quot;IF YOU DISAGREE WITH ME THEN YOU ARE A TRAITOR TO OUR WONDERFUL BLIZZARD OVERLORDS&quot;<br />

Frankly, I feel sorry for the state of the game in Cataclysm. I was hoping it would actually bring back some spark into my Warrior (that I have hence quit the week after hard modes were released), much like TBC and even WotLK did. However, all I see are massive changes centered around PvP and this new hard-on of punishing healers come expansion time (again, due to PvP problems with mana imbalancing). It's sad, because almost every blue post I read lately has the general feel of:<br />
<br />
&quot;K, we're just going to say &quot;FUCK IT&quot; to PvE and focus on PvP guys and try to balance that. You guys can get badges and whatnot, and we'll make normal modes easy for you so you won't have to worry about imbalances. In the meantime, you might want to try out rated Battlegrounds!<br />
<br />
For all you hardcore gamers, there will be hard modes. I'm sure the increased difficulty (i.e. bugs and glitches) will make it acceptably difficult for you. We'll have stacking bonuses though, over time, to make sure that everyone can see all of the content though, so you better get your asses in gear, fatties!&quot;</div></div><hr />

I call bullshit and you trying to play DA to Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Raising the cost of dispels doesn't make it any &quot;smarter&quot; to use. People see a debuff, they will remove it. Beyond that, it doesn't matter. Raising the cost of the spell doesn't inherently make it more difficult. If you really believe it does....<br />
<br />
You want to know how to make dispelling a real challenge? Have 10+ types of debuffs to dispel, and give each and every type of dispel to each healer. Then change the spell abilities around so that some spells gives debuff A, then B, then C, etc. This Poison, Magic, Disease, Curse? That's a 1/4 chance, and it's color coded. That's retardedly easy, whether your dispel costs 190 mana or 1950 mana. Now, if you had a style where you have a remove Paralyze, Slow, Poison, Blind, Stun, Fire/Ice/Arcane/Nature/Shadow Vulnerablities, Terror, and about 10 different other ones -- THEN dispelling would be difficult. If you had to choose which was more dangerous then and know how to counteract it? THEN it's high difficulty factor.<br />
<br />
Is that type of dispelling completely out of whack? Yeah, but it's how you make something more DIFFICULT. Raising the mana cost? That's attacking mana regen (MUST ATTACK HEALERS HUFF HUFF HUFF), not &quot;difficulty of dispelling&quot;. All this swapping around and dispelling changes does is screw over some classes, and gives others something to do -- ALL for the sake of PvP. This doesn't doesn't make pushing that dispel button for poison removal any more difficult than it does now. It's a fucking button push. <br />

Use your brain.<br />

Dispels that not only cost a lot more mana, but dont autoscript a stop if theres nothing to dispel defensively? NOW THAT IS TOO FAR. Thats incredibly annoying not to mention confusing when there are 2 people dispelling on one person, where's the logic in that? <br />

ArP is a redundant stat that requires more math to resolve than AP. Both are stats that directly boost melee damage. They're just different mathematical formulas to get to the same end. In other words, ArP is a terrible design decision because it adds nothing to the game besides extra complexity. Complexity for its own sake is asinine and (to beat the horse) a TERRIBLE design decision. Just because you bothered to figure out ArP doesn't make the stat well thought out or worth keeping around.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're a fucking moron, and you're just sipping the Blizzard kool-aid.<br />
<br />
Haste and Crit also &quot;only&quot; increase melee (physical) damage through a different formula, why aren't you getting rid of those too?<br />
<br />
ArP vs. other stats isn't even close to the same as Spell Healing vs. Spell Damage. Both of those stats added to spells in the EXACT SAME WAY, just that one of them applied to less spells than the other and cost less item points.<br />
<br />
ArP isn't even CLOSE to being the same as AP. ALL offensive stats simply &quot;boost melee damage&quot; for physical classes, are you saying we should go down to 1 stat on gear?<br />
<br />
Stop buying the Blizzard PR about &quot;complexity is bad design.&quot; You sound like a moron parroting back what Ghostcrawler put in your mouth.<br />
<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
I could say &quot;stack crit to do more damage&quot; or &quot;stack haste to do more damage&quot; or &quot;stack strength to do more damage&quot; or &quot;stack mastery to do more damage&quot; and it would accomplish the same thing as EJ telling noobs to &quot;stack arp to do more damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just because it becomes a VERY GOOD stat at HIGH LEVELS OF GEAR doesn't mean that it should be removed entirely. The balance between the value of different stats in terms of how much they will increase your current DPS is one of the most interesting parts of WoW. And that balance isn't even close to static, it's constantly shifting depending on how much you already have of that stat and all the other stats.</div></div><hr />

Are you retarded? When you're healing and focusing on a target in the heat of a bg ur not going to catch quick reflex changes that happen in the span of 2-3 seconds. Is has nothing to do with playing smarter, its like getting penalized for having quick reflexes and making the decision to remove an allie's debuffs before initially healing them.

Because that's not all they're doing. Both crit and haste cause other abilities or trinkets to proc more. They can also change your rotation. ArP isn't exactly an interesting stat. You start gemming it when a spreadsheet tells you to, great.<br />

It doesn't fix anything.<br />
<br />
The resulting selection for classes doesn't make any sense to me with lore and logic. I'd rather see something such as:<br />
Druid: Disease, Poison.<br />
Paladin: Offensive Magic, Curse.<br />
Priest: Curse, Disease.<br />
Shaman: Offensive Magic, Poison.<br />
<br />
Next up, is the concept of offensive magic dispells, only being used in healing -- ie. defensive -- specs and no longer in offensive -- ie. dps, tank -- specs.<br />
How does it make sense to not only ask a healer to monitor, heal and dispell friendly players, but to also monitor and dispell enemies? Most healers i know complain about anything that could ever require them to target a boss or trash/adds. That's something that's always been left to those in an offensive role, already attacking and having the target... targetted.<br />
<br />
I'm all for the idea of changing this system, but Blizzard seem to have gone a bit overboard with the idea and just plan to replace one problematic system with another.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't make sense. And since dispelling Curses already is a resto talent, non-resto shamans will lose the ability to dispel anything but buffs from enemies. How silly. Also goodbye shamans in arena, since they can't handle dk's and rogues and only locks use curses, and those aren't the worst dots/debuffs.<br />
<br />
As for pally's, couldn't they just make the dispel self-cast only for non-Holy pally's? <br />
<br />
I especially hate this from a solo/levelling point of view. It's great to be able to save your ass by removing a nasty debuff(the &quot;random stun&quot; curse from some satyrs in Ashenvale comes to mind), and losing that will be a pain.</div></div><hr />

Heat of bg. Haha. They don't want you to heal by reflexes. They want you to think before you heal or dispell. That's also the reason everyone is getting higher health. Tool.<br />

Not once, but twice you've missed the point, who's to say that there wont be another healer targeting ur target and cast dispell on that same person? Thats a mana penalty for unlucky timing, and just a pointless burden on whoever gets the last cast in.

If that situation arises, you take the penalty. To avoid be penalized more, you don't spam dispel, and you have to pay attention to your targets buffs/debuffs. In other words, take the penalty, be smart about how and when you use it, take into consideration the players next to you and what they are capable of. Be a flexible player.</div></div><hr />

Thats essentially what most of over healing is anyway, you could QQ about wasted heals cause someone else got there first.<br />
<br />
And I think people should chill out just a little bit. You all are thinking about these changes in terms of how things currently are, but just about every system in the game is going to change. wait for the big picture then QQ.<br />
<br />
And for Shamans, ya loosing the totems seems to suck, but im guessing a revamp of shaman mechanics on a scale similar to rets for wotlk. wait and see, then QQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i can imagine what blizz is trying to do with the new Dispel mechanics<br />
<br />
right now we have a flood or poisons/curses/etc being tossed at the players both pvp and pve<br />
and near permanent buffs being pilled up<br />
<br />
dispelling in the game now now means either spam dispels(virtually become immune to that kind of debuff), use a 1 shot cure all trinket/cooldown or live with the debuff<br />
and they cant add more powerfulls short buffs(avenging wrath, bloodlust) becouse is hard to counter them<br />
<br />
what blizz is trying to do is throw away that old system and a add a new one<br />
<br />
what they want is making buffs and debuffs more usefull and making dispelling require skill <br />
<br />
in the new system likely we will see:<br />
<br />
-interface change that allows to see what can be dispelled or not better<br />
-when someone get a buff or debuff, will be a big event, not the &quot;live with it&quot; of today<br />
-permanent buffs(arcane intellect etc) not dispellable<br />
-less frequent debuffs (you wont need that cleasing totem anyway)<br />
-less useless debuffs *cough* scorpid sting *cough* since they can be countered<br />
-more powerful short buffs(think of bloodlust/heroism) since they can be countered<br />
-classes that can dispell a kind of debuff ain't &quot;immune&quot; to it<br />
-raid boss fights that involve dispelling in a clever way(not nowdays spamming of dispells)<br />
-you being able to use debuffs strategically in pvp ,such as adding a smaller debuff just to be dispelled and then use a real game changer debuff<br />
-offensive dispelling being more useful(think of dispelling bloodlust of a mage charging a pyroblast at you)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
tl;dr version:<br />
is a good change, they want to make buff and debuff matter more in the game<br />
but dont just dont think of it in to the live game, lots more will be changed than just this, they just giving the general idea</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerzia</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the viewpoint of a restoration shaman with two restoration specs (pve and pvp).<br />
<br />
As it is right now... cleansing totem is a major strategic decision made by the shaman, designed to shore up our otherwise incredibly lacking defenses from rogues, hunters, (edit: and devouring plague, and infected wounds) and death knights (and when said classes aren't present, other totems (such as HST or MTT) will be used... though on occasion a shaman might decide that a single rogue (especially if they fail) isn't enough of a reason to use cleansing totem)... but done in a way that also creates a strategic decision for said classes (will the shaman drop cleansing totem? If so, do I need to remove it to take this one or his teammate out?). Altogether it adds a great deal of strategic thinking to the game that it otherwise lacks when confronted with otherwise pretty simple shaman. Removing cleansing totem in pvp will not only adversely effect the shaman's survival when attacked by a rogue, DK, or hunter... but also entirely removes a primary threat to poison/disease using classes... one they notably lack in a form other than mass dispel or single-target dispels.<br />
<br />
What do I think about the removal of cleansing totem? Absolutely terrible idea, especially for pvp... but one that has adverse effects in pve as well. It provides the shaman's group with the assurance that poisons and diseases will be cleansed, and the shaman can pay more attention to affecting hitpoint bars and other elements of the fight. While my resto shaman would just love to be able to dispel magic as well... our inability to dispel magic forces us to make more strategic decisions on how to deal with any magic-debuffing spellcasters (Notably warlocks, other shaman (in particular elemental and enhancement, though dispelling frost shock can be rather helpful at times), frost and arcane mages, shadow priests, survival hunters (though all hunters can affect the shaman with dispellable magic), and boomkin)... such as is it bad enough to switch Earth Shield off of my buddy... do i risk getting interrupted if i cast a large heal... will riptide+run be enough for this, or will i have to hex/heal... will that mage sheep this fool or am I about to get wtf-pwnt? Good stratigic questions... much more interesting that having a nearly automatic answer to them being &quot;dispel magic spam&quot;.<br />
<br />
So far as increasing dispels' mana cost to make it a more difficult decision: Is it that difficult of a decision to use a riptide whenever one is being attacked? To instawolf away for the glory of the horde when one's left ankle was just stabbed by a warrior? To sit there spamming lesser healing wave while one snickers at the boomkin, non-MS hunter, or retadin? Hardly. Is it any more or less difficult of a decision to spam cleanse disease on the move when one's being attacked by a DK indoors and earthbind was just destroyed and frost shock is temporarily on cooldown? Hardly. If you want to make cleansing a difficult decision... make it come at the cost of you having to do the hokey pokey for 5 minutes per cleanse, monitored by a webcam. That'd certainly make cleansing a thing done only when it absolutely must be done. Do I think it's retarded that some people think it is not a challenging decision to use cleanse (a whole global cooldown mon... one which might be better served to frost shock, earthbind, or unleash da fury of de elements, or heal an ally with riptide so that they don't die, or instead cleanse that ally, or perhaps flame shock + lavaburst to get the enemy thinking about their own life a little more, or replace your tremor so this warlock doesn't successfully get a whole fear off on you, or use rocket boots around a pillar and get off a large heal, or hex the fool! So many options mon... it's hardly an 'easy' decision to make... as can be said of many other decisions one makes in this game (go to fel reaver ruins or the mage tower first? Stay on D in the flagroom, play it out in middle, or heal the O team and FC? Chance that stables is unguarded early on, or go mine with 4 buddies?). This whole game is a game of decisions... if a person thins it's the best decision to walk away dispelling your dots, then they do. Adapt to their strategy and outmaneuver/outpredict them.<br />
<br />
And above all else: stop complaining that it is pvp mucking up the game for pve. If there is any &quot;good?&quot; reason to remove cleansing totem, it is because it can sit there for half the group in 10-man Nax (or all of the group in 5-mans) and simplify the healing by bucketloads. It does all of the disease-poisen dispelling work for the shaman's group (without the shaman lifting a finger), making them wonderful in raids to have in group with a tank who will get raped by a poison or disease that the healers would otherwise have to stop healing the raid for a gcd to dispell. Wherever the shaman is placed and has their totem down, they've made life much easier for their entire group. That's the only reason that blizzard could have any desire to get rid of it (and mostly the reason players such as myself are highly against the change, though some of them wouldn't care too much if we could still keep the functionality of the totem for only the shaman who casts it... it would remain a massive nerf and we would see much less usage from the totem in pvp (and especially pve!) if such a change were ever made). <br />
<br />
I am a restoration shaman, and I do not support this change. ;)</div></div><hr />

I wish they could keep Cleansing Totem as a &quot;one pulse&quot; ability that removes a disease and poison of everyone within range when you drop it and that's it.

It seems to me that it would be more appropriate for Paladins to have Magic, Disease and Curse while Shamans had Magic, Offensive Magic and Poison.</div></div><hr />

Bullshit. The only thing that differentiates a good tank/DPS from a bad tank/DPS is their TPS/DPS. Seriously. It's not about using all your class abilities correctly and to the benefit of the group, it's about having more opportunities to fuck up your rotation. Lrn2BlizzardDevelop, scrub.<br />

<br />
Atm in arena i hop in and out of LoS when i know i have to dispel a melee from frost nova / mage slows all the time so i guess its sort of a buff for mage teams in that regard but now that druids can dispel allies and cant be polymorphed its gonna fuck mages up vs any druid team since you cant CC at all.. bit of an OP change for druids imo, time to make them polymorphable in any form?<br />
<br />
its sort of gone from:<br />
- 'cheap' dispels with no penalty for spam dispelling<br />
<br />
to:<br />
- 'expensive' dispels with 100% penalty (i.e. mana loss) if the target has nothing to dispel<br />
<br />
Id much rather see 20-40% of the dispel magic cost being wasted if the target has no buffs/debuffs to dispel and currently dispel magic removes 2 offensive buffs or 2 friendly debuffs.. what if theres only 1 buff to dispel? might be cool to refund some of the dispel cost instead of wasting 100% of a more expensive version of the dispel magic spell in both situations (0 and 1 buff/debuff to remove).</div></div><hr />

so, lemme get this straight, all shaman will be able to cure curses and ofc purge, but only resto dispel magic, too? and we will loose dispell poisons and diseases? why are shaman the only ones swapping different dispels, but others remaining the same or gaining new dispells? :/ QQ. not that poison and disease cleanse was useful against rogues anyway, still...<br />
<br />
wasted dispels? for pvp good thing i guess, for pve? Dunno, sounds like all they want is to make healers job even harder and less forgiving, whereas i havent seen single change yet, that would make it harder for dps and they announced like yesterday thay are getting rid of &quot;on next attack&quot; abilites, thus making it easier for tanks... yeah...<br />

<br />
<br />
sure, &quot;more interesting to use&quot; means &quot;we will get rid of the interesting and actually unique totems&quot;...<br />
<br />
I have yet to see overhaul to shaman totems, calls and 5 min durations were good changes, but i wouldnt call it &quot;more interesting to use&quot; rather than &quot;still boring, still limited in function&quot;, more interesting to use totems were always the unique ones, you know... cleansing, grounding, tremor, earthbind, those are the good totems, getting rid of one of them wont make it for &quot;more interesting&quot; gameplay<br />
<br />
<br />
still, I fully expect talents with dispel protection to be completely gone, otherwise what would be the point of expensive dispels, than can be wasted, just to not succeed in alot of cases?</div></div><hr />

I mean honestly.. it takes so much skill to mash a dispel/purge/spellsteal button against classes that rely on diseases, HoTs, magic, etc, etc, etc..<br />

Just keep mashing the key. If nothing is on you at the time, nothing happens and you waste no mana. About time those filthy dispellers actually have a penalty for mashing their face against their dispel key. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello dispel totem?!<br />
<br />
But honestly, i do fully understand that this is still pre-first stage of changes, but the changes being made to shaman in that one post are significant. Someone mentioned earlier about how deep into the tree's this dispel talent will be, might i direct them to the shaman tree (which could very well change) and see how far down in the tree the cleanse spirit.. let me save you the trouble, 30 points +1 for talent.<br />
<br />
Another point earlier was that Mages dispels won't go up in cost.. all the post said was that the mechanics will remain the same, said nothing about the cost, so i'd think it would be safe to assume that mages dispel costs will rise the same as the rest.<br />
<br />
I'll reserve my full judgement till i see the preliminary class layouts here in a few days, but at this very moment i'm leaning to a thumbs down.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CaptainBlah</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My two mains are a prot/ret paladin and an ele/resto shaman, and I'm unhappy for both at the moment. I PvP as ret, and unless we get some significant buffs (MS/snare/interrupts/whatever), this is a major major nerf PvPwise. Even with some of those buffs, being forced to eat lots of magic damage if you don't have a healer around or, for example, run into a frost mage, is not exactly fun. Not that spamming cleanse is either, but given our toolset, it's not like I have much of an option.<br />
<br />
As a PvE tank, this also upsets me. No, I don't spend a lot of time cleansing per se, but it comes in handy (Jaraxxus, Faction Champs, Blood Princes, archmages on Dreamwalker), and it gave us some utility which was fun to use.<br />
<br />
As a shaman....meh. I think it's been said already.<br />
<br />
Standard disclaimer: it's possible that upcoming changes/buffs will help negate this, but class homogenizing and removal of hybrid utlity doesn't sit well with me.</div></div><hr />

Which is one of the main reasons why people don't like world of warcraft. Some people think it's completely mindless, so they are doing what they can to better reward people with actual reflexes (without causing the entire game to collapse onto itself).<br />

<br />
For one, Now in arena it 'balances' things out if you think about it, however it kind of destroys class combinations, sure some classes may bring different buffs (priests absorbs, druids rolling hots, shamans totems (though cleansing is gone), paladin hand of &lt;name&gt;). But giving all healers a defensive dispel is abit much.<br />
<br />
Allowing shamans and druids to dispel magic (defensively) makes them incredibly OP in my perspective. Don't get me wrong, I play a shaman and I think I'm fine in PvP as it is. Now a Shaman with Tremor down and grounding rotations+interrupts will make them near impossible to CC, a Druid who can dispel magic is just as bad, Can't be poly'd so you usually can gib a druid with a lucky fear + stun while CCing his DPS, but now a druid will just hump a pillar even more throwing out HoTs and now they can dispel CCs, Priests however I feel will have a disadvantage, always snared, prone to alot of CC (Penance channeling) and only class that hasn't got any dispel changes to them so they pretty much remain the same.<br />
<br />
Poison Dispels is hardly a big thing for a shaman and priest to worry about, but a priest cannot interrupt nor can they ground incoming spells (Hex and Scream pretty much shares a similar CD).<br />
<br />
<br />
However from a PvE perspective it will really help, especially on magic dispel reliant fights ....... there aren't many, maybe Cata will put in fights where healers will need to watch dispels once again :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
... this is um... interesting?<br />
<br />
It's great that all these classes will have some form of magic removal (offensive/defensive), I feel some have lost more than others in this proposed idea if none at all. What isn't a grand design idea is to leave a dispelling capability on a healer instead of the hybrid being able to do it as well. I'd understand keeping all 3 dispell mechanics over the specs for each class would be a little overkill but being able to talent to the 3rd dispell mechanic is a nice touch.<br />
<br />
Granted we don't know what content we will see come Cata in both dungeons and raid and all of this is still subject to change. It does sadden me that as an elemental shaman that I can't quickly strip a negative debuff from my party because the healer rather just soak mana into people instead of remove it. I have also had to cleanse myself on my prot paladin many a time because the healer would rather sit and pick his nose because no healing is needed to be done. Having those mechanics removed hurts a lot. Granted this game is all about teamwork in one form or another but to rely on someone who more than likely isn't going to remove that negative off of me or another party member makes me worry greatly.</div></div><hr />

Level 60-80 raids will be pisseasy at level 85 regardless of dispel changes and obviously level 85 raids will be made with these changes in mind. (AKA only magic debuffs in 10-man and a variation of debuffs in 25.)<br />
For pvp it's way too early to tell. As far as we know rogues' poisons will be considered magic debuffs, death knights will use hello kitty stickers instead of diseases and warlock spells could become undispellable <br />

Restoration shaman, Restoration druids, and Holy paladins will need to talent into their defensive magic dispels.<br />

So now resto shamans will have to spec into Purge (http://www.wowhead.com/spell=370) ??? A spell we first recieved at level 12.<br />

In Cataclysm we are raising the mana costs, making it possible to waste mana by casting a dispel when there is nothing to dispel, and removing Cleansing Totem, Abolish Disease, and Abolish Poison from the game.<br />

That hurts a little, not that much but couple that with:<br />

All shaman will lose dispel disease and dispel poison in exchange for Restoration gaining dispel magic. <br />

Sucks for my raid group...<br />
<br />
<br />
I was about to say this as well. I'm upset about this since I love my druid, and my bf loves his shaman. But now shamans can't cleanse diseases?? Currently I'm mainly using my holy pally because I've found it to be easier since the tanks are just.. taken care of. But I was hoping that in Cata things would change to where I could use my druid with his shaman instead.. guess not..<br />
<br />
I'm surprised that no druid in the first or last page (haven't read in between, sorry) has initiated a QQ about having another class able to take away our hots/innervate. D; I guess it won't be so bad though since the cost of dispelling is getting increased.<br />
<br />
@Eye: Purge is an offensive magic dispel, I thought? It says we have to spec into defensive magic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Defensive dispel isn't the same as purge, that's called an offensive dispel.<br />
Defensive dispels are meant for magic debuffs on friendly targets, offensive dispels are meant to remove buffs from enemies.<br />
<br />
Anyway you don't know how raids will change, nor what your class will look like at 85. No point wasting time whining about this.</div></div><hr />

Bring the class not the pla....... I mean really. For PVE this is gonna make things nothing short of annoying when trying to do encounters when you dont have:<br />
<br />
A paladin or druid for encounters with poisons<br />
A paladin or priest for encounters with diseases<br />
A druid or a shaman for encounters with curses.<br />
<br />
So basically a small 10 man guild WILL have to bring the class over the player for some certain bosses. If you don't you're just gonna be screwed.<br />
<br />
I feel horrible for all you who have resto shaman as mains. Now you'll be down to 2 dispels for PVE. Can't really remember the last time that I ever heard of a shaman using purge in PVE.</div></div><hr />

Let's try common sense shall we.<br />
1) Blizzard is giving every healer a defensive dispel. <br />
2) In 10-mans Blizzard doesn't expect one healer of each class to be present.<br />
1+2) In 10-mans there will only be magic debuffs, with perhaps an occasional disease/poison that doesn't affect the encounter by much.<br />
<br />

Nah, you're alone. Spir/MP5 and ArP/AP are two stats that do the same thing, so might as well bag one since they are redundant.<br />
<br />
Kinda irritated about the shaman changes, but not surprised. From a pve perspective, cleansing totem was either OP and negated boss mechanics entirely or totally useless (LK p1, Rotface). From a pvp perspective they threw out so many dispell resist mechanics on their precious little rogues that poison cleansing has been useless for some time now.</div></div><hr />

In Cataclysm we are raising the mana costs, making it possible to waste mana by casting a dispel when there is nothing to dispel, and removing Cleansing Totem, Abolish Disease, and Abolish Poison from the game.<br />
<br />
That hurts a little, not that much but couple that with:<br />
<br />
All shaman will lose dispel disease and dispel poison in exchange for Restoration gaining dispel magic. <br />

<br />
Yeah you're gaining no new spell, no new talents, they will take away your heroism as well, Blizzard is only after shamans and you're gonna nerfed to the ground baby. Probably also loosing your totems and mail armor. Seriously though, way to overreact to something that can change a 1000 times from now and also you know nothing about other class changes.</div></div><hr />

How can you even think of whining about pvp balance when not even a single talent tree is released or what spells/abilities will get changed. For all we know rogues will not apply poisons, but glow in the dark hello kitty stickers.</div></div><hr />

Not really no, we have 2 mages that spellsteal instead. And yes my small guild has 0 priest healers, and only 1 holy paladin who never raids anymore at all. So yes we would be completely missing disease dispels.</div></div><hr />

And obviously Blizzard know this and will make 10-man raids with that in mind ..<br />
Again most likely there will only be magic debuffs in 10-man raids.</div></div><hr />

Explain me how?<br />
Dispelling has been changed to left or right clicking your dispel add-on anyway, who cares if it's called a poison/disease or magic debuff? From a development point of view it's a good idea.</div></div><hr />

Now you'll actually have to ... have skill to dispel in PVP? Actually have to make a decision to dispel things instead of mashing the dispel button the moment any sort of debuff appears on yourself or a teammate?<br />

In 25-man you'll obviously have all kind of debuffs, but in 10-man that would be ridiculous. You have to either give every class too many dispels (for example shamans currently can dispel pretty much everything) which sucks for pvp or you limit the debuffs in 10-man to magic debuffs and they're actually able to concentrate on the mechanics.<br />
<br />
I don't know how a debuff saying poison/disease makes any difference, it's what the debuff does to the raid that should make the difference. Or would you prefer all classes with (nearly) all debuffs or having to bring a specific healer couple?</div></div><hr />

so I guess shadow priest will be absolutely worthless in pvp again. The bulk of the shadow priest damage comes from magical dots. Now that every arena team will have a healer capable of dispels, how does a shadow priest even do any damage now</div></div><hr />

In this post it's already been stated dispel abilities will cost a lot more mana, so blindly dispelling would mean empty mana pools for healers.<br />
On top of that ALL classes are getting completely reworked, as far as you know shadow priests won't use magic debuffs anymore. They might for example all be called diseases or some will become undispellable.</div></div><hr />

It's already like this. They're just normalizing it to &quot;everyone can deal with three things&quot;. As it is Druids can only deal with poisons and curses, while Pallies can deal with everything except curses. Plus it's three different spells for Druids (with two of them removing poisons, but using different mechanics, WTF?), but all Pallies have to do is Cleanse and it deals with everything. Meanwhile, Shammies put down a totem at the begininng of the fight and goes, &quot;LOL! Disease? What's Disease? Or Poison? These are funny words.&quot; <br />
<br />
This is a fairly good way to normalize healers so they can distribute dispels equally, but at the same time not make all healers the same. I'll miss the &quot;fire and forget&quot; dispel on Abolish Poison, but at least I won't feel like I got shafted since I can hardly get rid of anything and Pallies can get rid of everything.</div></div><hr />

The. fight. mechanics. shouldn't. change. between. 25. and. 10. mans.<br />
<br />
The only changes should be hp, damage and amount of adds, if applicable.<br />

It would be POOR DESIGN if a fight in 25 man has diseases, but the same fight in 10man only has magic debuffs.</div></div><hr />

Both druids and paladins will be able to dispell the same poisons, magic, etc.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER only Paladins are loosing this ability when going Ret or Prot, whereas a Druid is fine no matter what form they're in.<br />
<br />
Add this to the fact that Paladins are still &quot;deep&quot; in the revision, while the other classes are ready to annouce in the next couple days makes this paladin VERY nervous.</div></div><hr />
