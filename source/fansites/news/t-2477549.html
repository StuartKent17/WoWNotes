The quest chain that leads up to the Crucible of Storms raid is now live! The quest involves Xal'atath and servers as a lead up to the opening of the new raid next week! THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!<br />
<br />
<br />
The quest starts at any Naga Attack! world quest. Killing naga at the world quest will award the Azsharan Medallion (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165605-azsharan-medallion) which starts the quest The Azsharan Medallion (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/54141-the-azsharan-medallion).<br />
Once you take the medallion to Collector Kojo, he will have you pick up Xal'atath and take her to an altar on top of the island North of Seeker's Vista.<br />
Once placed on the Altar, her voice will speak from the blade and ask that you feed her souls of the nearby naga. <br />
After charging the blade, she begins to speak to you, telling you that the naga are intending to summon a storm to wipe the world clean of nonbelievers. She realizes it may be disconcerting to converse with a weapon, but says she wants to help you. If you are a priest, the conversation plays out differently, otherwise she will mention her time with a priest of Azeroth before having you retrieve a void stone in Drustvar.<br />
After stopping a ritual for the void stone, you unleash Xal'atath from the blade and give her a mortal form (a female void elf). She compliments you and then sends you to the outdoor world Freehold to retrieve the Trident of Deep Ocean from a pirate chest (after killing the pirate for the key).<br />
Xal'atath suggests fate brought you two together, and then has you retrieve the Tempest Crown from the giant crab Toatana in a cave in northern Vol'dun.<br />
She then has you bring the relics and meet her at the Precipice of Oblivion near the Shrine of the Storm in Stormsong Valley.<br />
Once inside the Crucible of Storms, you place the relics and awaken the sleeping eye of N'zoth! Xal'atath says that she has brought him the key to open the way, and then takes her leave while saying all worlds are now open to her. She says you will meet again.<br />
N'zoth then speaks to you, eventually bestowing his &quot;gift&quot; upon you.<br />
You now have a permanent buff called &quot;Gift of N'zoth&quot; that grants you an eye on your forehead. For as long as you have the buff you can see the eye of others who also possess the buff. In speaking to Brother Pike, he says that he does not wish you to become an eye for N'zoth and asks you to meet him at the Crucible of Storms to cleanse the gift.<br />
Upon arriving, you are given the permanent choice on whether or not to remove the buff. We don't yet know the consequences of either decision, but cleansing it gives you the Twitching Eyeball (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168123-twitching-eyeball) toy.<br />

Not really - Paladins and Priests and just we connected to the light. Just because something has a strong connection with the light it doesn’t mean they can’t interact with anything Void.</div></div><hr />

&quot;So if you cleanse the gift you receive a toy you can use to reapply the gift?<br />

Why wouldn't you cleanse it if the toy does the same thing?&quot;<br />

<br />
Apparently, without cleansing it, you can see it on the heads of other players who didn't cleanse it as well, whereas with the toy you don't see it on the people who didn't cleanse it. Kinda a sign of a secret club of Old God worshipers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just as the saurfang decision quest gave you something. These quests seem to be leaned towards the option that shows you more &quot;content&quot; anyway, punishing you somehow if you are not doing it. You're pretty safe getting the Toy.</div></div><hr />

Sure it doesn't mean you cant interact, but it means that said paladin will feel enorm pain.<br />
<br />
Light and void dont work very harmonically together.<br />

For priests tho, its different, as they arent walking vessels of light like palas are.</div></div><hr />

I just did the quest and it doesn't seem like we can even finish the quest if we select the option to keep. so I guess we can cleanse it later on</div></div><hr />

Exactly.<br />
<br />
Blizzard need to take risks with this game and have decisions that are permanent.<br />
<br />
The problem is world/character building isn't their strong point.</div></div><hr />

Really wanted to keep it but it looks way too jarring and doesn't really fit with your character's looks, atleast in my case, so turned it off.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sigxy the Lemming</div><div class="date">2019-04-10, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ech, done the questline and really getting bad vibes from it. Aside from making the player character seem really stupid (With all the things that has happened, how couldn't the player character know this was a bad idea from the start when even the quest itself has the text saying this was probably a bad idea? Even Talanji on the Horde side goes &quot;And if any shadowy weapons ask you to do favors for dem in de future... I suggest you decline.&quot;)...<br />
<br />
Given how Blizzard's story writers aren't that... great, I feel like this is a plot with such a HUGE potential that Blizzard can NOT write anything to justify it. It just feels like a great plot device that they will mess up.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm negative. At this point the only way Blizzard impresses me is if I go in with a careful mind of how bad it can be - and then have them surprise me with how pleasant it is and I can speak of how great it was and hope they make more of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
Blizzard need to take risks with this game and have decisions that are permanent.<br />
<br />
The problem is world/character building isn't their strong point.<br />
<br />
And this is why I'm rather worried about what Blizzard is doing.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but that would require actual devs and creativivity not being crushed underneath corporate greed lard rolls.</div></div><hr />

Hah. Well said. Only thing that's actually got any passion left within the WoW team imo is the art team. And I kinda feel bad for them being stuck there.</div></div><hr />

Ikr, just the cringe-show at they Diablo mobile inveil during BlizzCon was so striking. Devs wanting to work on shitty cash-grab titles? They've either been driven insane, a blatant lie, or both. <br />
<br />
While wow isn't graphically anything to be wow'd over (hah hah), it has something going for it, and it's a nice diversion from all the relentless spit and polish you get desensitized to, but...yeah, art alone won't do much in the long run. <br />
<br />
In the end, story and engaging delivery of said story is what matters when you get down to it, and it's just not up to scratch. I really don't like being railroaded with the idiotic choices my character's sometimes forced to make just to advance a story. I get that it can be hard to do something engaging when it's 2 opposing factions, and it still has to be fair and give/take, problem there is that the playerbase is really poor at handling that too. <br />
<br />
Might be an unpopular opinion, but I honestly think player factions like that need to go. Make 1 big faction with smaller dynamic factions to have running events for opposition/cooporation vs others etc, but ultimately the story will be the same, and more streamlined to actually have more alternate paths that actually matter and impact the game for that character.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft doesn't have to keep being petty faction war after the umpteenth global threat from a greater foe that we end up banding together to defeat anyway.</div></div><hr />

I believe there is additional dialogue and a different tone but the quest overall is the same.</div></div><hr />

But for some insanely stupid reason Blizzard decided to make the blessing put a permanent big ugly eyeball headband on you in a game where people generally care about how their character looks like. Couldn't they have made the blessing more subtle looking like an aura or a floating eye above our heads?</div></div><hr />

Wanted to keep it, but that eyeball just is too big and too hideous.<br />

So don't do the quest. Exercise your free will.</div></div><hr />

It's not even disguised as doing something good - you are clearly helping an evil object for no one's benefit but its own. So why would you ever do it? Obviously you do it because it's a thing to do in the game, but from a story perspective it makes no sense.<br />
Also, if we can re-power the shadow priest artifact, why can't we do this to the other artifacts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There’s nothing in game to really make it seem like you are doing this for no gain. As stated in another thread, the blade isn’t inherently evil from a lore standpoint, but it is void touched. It’s nothinv more than a powerful blade that has tasted the void and whispers the same things that gets whispered to Void Elves. The blade was also harnessed to help Azeroth, not hurt it. <br />
Xal led the hero on a quest to collect items that it stated would help reveal the Nagas plan and why they are hunting artifacts. It’s not revealed that she is going to betray you until she does.<br />
It’s also revealed that the reason that Xal can be recharged is because it’s not just a simple artifact, but a prison. The entity inside is what is getting recharged, not the artifact itself.<br />

Technically, she isn't even betraying us.<br />
We were not looking for this outcome, but it might still be in our favour in the end, compared to the alternative.</div></div><hr />
