Raid Testing Schedule - February 10<br />
On Friday, February 10, we will be conducting a preliminary raid test of two Tomb of Sargeras Heroic bosses. This is as much a stress test and server-stability test as anything else, and these bosses will be revisited later on.<br />
<br />
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic, of course, requires a fixed 20-player group.<br />
<br />
Friday, February 10<br />
<br />
Gornoth - Heroic Tomb of Sargeras<br />
13:00 PST (16:00 EST, 22:00 CET)<br />
<br />
Harjatan - Heroic Tomb of Sargeras<br />
14:00 PST (17:00 EST, 23:00 CET)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br />
A: In Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade Sr. in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)<br />
<br />
Q: What character should I use to test the raid?<br />
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players' effective level to 110 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounter(s) being tested. For 7.2 raid testing, we'll be granting players all the new 7.2 artifact traits IF players have done the quest to reveal those new traits. Complete the Broken Shore intro experience in order to access this quest.<br />
<br />
Q: How long does testing last?<br />
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we're satisfied that we've received that information for a given boss, we'll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.<br />
<br />
Q: Raid testing already? Only a handful of guilds have even finished Mythic Nighthold! Are you out of your damn minds?<br />
A: We realize this is coming right on the heels of plenty of raid content on the live servers, and that competitive guilds feel like they need to get every bit of exposure to upcoming content in order to be properly prepared. It's not ideal timing, but it's a consequence of the way we're structuring our content releases, and something we're looking for ways to improve and continue to refine over the course of Legion. As we've said in the past, Tomb of Sargeras will not be available right when 7.2 unlocks, and a quest arc (akin to the 7.1 Suramar Insurrection campaign) will lead up to its opening. We certainly do not want to rush players through content faster than they can enjoy it - Nighthold is going to be the premiere raid for some time to come. <br />
<br />
But Tomb of Sargeras, at least as far as art assets, and most descriptive text, voice overs, and so forth goes, needs to be in patch 7.2 data. That means we need to begin testing it far earlier, relative to the date when the raid will actually go live, than we have in past expansions. But this week's test is just dipping our toes in the water to assess the stability of the overall testing environment, identify class bugs or server issues that might hinder raid testing, and get the process started.<br />
<br />
These two bosses will be retested in the future, and likely more than once. There are weeks of raid testing to come, and it's exceedingly likely that testing for numerical tuning purposes and bug fixing will occur in a PTR environment even after 7.2 is on the live servers. If you can log on this Friday to help us test, that's of course much appreciated, but if not, please rest assured that there will be plenty of additional opportunities to come.<br />

Appreciate all the feedback here - Mythics can be a bit contentious, and I've been in those situations where a person dropping out can ruin an entire run. It's definitely something on my radar.<br />

PTR Development Notes - Build 23530<br />
Since there’s still a lot of testing to be done on the content we introduced last week, this week’s update will be a little bit lighter. That said, there’s still several new things being enabled for testing in this build.<br />
<br />
This week fleshes out the Broken Shore zone a little more with the addition of the Sentinax: a Legion command ship that patrols the zone, sending in backup troops to certain areas when necessary. When it’s patrolling an area, you’ll be able to find Sentinax Beacons on nearby enemies. Use one of these beacons to cause the Sentinax to open demonic portals, which spawn more difficult creatures. When killed, those creatures drop Nethershards and crafting materials, as well as more powerful beacons that, in turn, summon more powerful creatures.<br />
<br />
Paladins and Mages can unlock a couple new followers in this build. If you’ve quested in Ungoro, you may remember a fellow by the name of “Maximillian of Northshire.” Paladins who have completed that quest line will be able to recruit him to their cause (for better or worse). Mages, on the other hand, will need to complete their class hall questline. Once that’s finished, the Great Akazamzarak – everyone’s favorite street magician – will have an important task for you. Help him out, and he’ll join you on your adventures.<br />
<br />
We’re planning to do a light amount of raid testing this week, primarily to check for stability and catch any major show-stopping bugs. The “real” raid testing will start next week, once we’re confident the PTR is ready. We’ll have more details to share on that schedule in the coming days.<br />
<br />
Finally, imagine a typical game of Warsong Gulch, where your team battles to capture the enemy’s flag while defending your own. Now imagine that you don’t need to defend your flag to capture theirs – just take a quick stroll across the battlefield with it and the point is yours. Oh, and there’s a whole bunch of extra flags. And some new powerups. You end up with something called “Warsong Scramble,” and that’s the next PvP Brawl up for testing. It’ll be available all week, but we especially hope to see you during Play with the Blues on Friday!<br />
<br />
Those are the major features we’re opening up with this build, but we’re hoping to start testing on most of the remaining 7.2 content in the next week or so – including flying, class mounts, and several other bits. Thanks again, and happy testing! <br />
<br />
<br />

We have officers in our guild, get on fine with them, good laugh. But raid nights, if you've not signed up and they spot you on a alt, you'll get bombarded with requests to come raid all night. <br />
<br />
As a specific example before I get blasted for being a raider and not signing up....<br />
<br />
Through January I had a intense work load, every day for 18 days. I started at 9am finished at 7pm just before raid time, I wanted to eat and chill out, do my emissary's etc. I explained the situation to the rl and gm. But the first night I logged in to chill out, I get wisped to come raid and had to say no.

<br />
Soulbound means that Donald has to be in the keystone run, and because Donald is not the best player, it makes it very hard. thatsthejoke.png</div></div><hr />

We have officers in our guild, get on fine with them, good laugh. But raid nights, if you've not signed up and they spot you on a alt, you'll get bombarded with requests to come raid all night. <br />
<br />
As a specific example before I get blasted for being a raider and not signing up....<br />
<br />
Through January I had a intense work load, every day for 18 days. I started at 9am finished at 7pm just before raid time, I wanted to eat and chill out, do my emissary's etc. I explained the situation to the rl and gm. But the first night I logged in to chill out, I get wisped to come raid and had to say no. Lost my raider rank down to social raider, not really fussed just annoying is all, so each night I logged on an alt on a different server. My point of this little story, our officers will add everyone through it, and we wont be able to hide so to speak. and I dont think this case is unique to us.<br />
<br />
To me, that is a bizarre way of running a guild. I've never heard of that method. Also, if it really bothers you that much and you're unwilling to friend the people running your raid, perhaps you should find a new guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wonder if these Nethershards they mention are going to be exactly the same Nethershards from the pre-launch event. Because if so, then the 40-odd Felbat Pups I stowed away before the expansion launched will become useless. And it was already looking like the price wouldn't be going up for years...</div></div><hr />

I actually really like the guild, we have a laugh, everyone gets on, its just everyone assumes that if you sign up as non available then 100% you're not gong to be online, and if you do come online its automatically assumed you've made an effort to come online to raid.<br />
<br />
9/10 its fine, if I don't think I can make it, I sign as non available, if I get home earlier than expected or what not I'm more than happy to go raid. But theres those few occasions where you just happen to log on and you don't want to. Thats all,<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I play with a team of RL mates in overwatch and I like to leave my battlenet on frequently when I do work from home at night. I purposely don't have officers (or people likely to say I'm online) on my list due to that. I know dam well I'll get pokes or beeps going off. Tbf, the gm will respect no is no, but you'll always have a couple of wisps every so often asking to re consider from someone, I don't think its unusual tbh</div></div><hr />

Typo? 2-piece bonus is the cooldown reduction, it's the 4-piece having no benefit with Dire Frenzy selected</div></div><hr />

No No No no. You can see if your facebook friends use battle.net, it won't give you a facebook profile link of your battle.net friends.</div></div><hr />

It's battle.net client integration which means that yes, D3 is also affected by this. I'm sure Blizzard considered their actions and probably decided it was worth losing a .0001% chance returning customer.</div></div><hr />

That's fine, I'm not trying to change Blizzard's mind about it, I'm just trying to keep FB's tentacles away from me. If that's the case, I'm done with Blizzard games, which isn't the end of the world, I'm happily obsessed with Civ 6 right now. I might give Prey a shot. There's plenty of games out there, after all. <br />
<br />
I know fighting the FB plague is like spitting into a tornado, but I'm still gonna quarantine myself from them at every opportunity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FB doesn't have access to Battle.net's Database. The FB integration is done via the Facebook Login API. It's an API that uses access tokens to do it's work with no databases exchanged at all.<br />
<br />
I have an odd feeling I just fell for your trap card :D<br />
<br />
<br />
In before &quot;It's optional&quot; - I don't care. I refuse to have anything to do with Facebook. They're in the game - who knows what they have access to, even with an opt-out. I don't trust Facebook, I expect them to do slimy, behind the scenes shady shit.<br />
<br />
As long as the battle.net team sticks to doing all the work with FB's public APIs I don't think we should worry too much about Facebook's intrusion into our game.<br />
<br />
Currently Facebook most probably doesn't have access to anything on the battle.net side. The implementation is done in a way similar to how third party applications connect to twitter's API database - with tokens you grant permission to as a connected application. When you integrate your FB account that's done via a user access token from Facebook. Once you connect it there's a page in Battle.net account management for Linked accounts where you can revoke permission if you so choose. Battle.net uses the same sort of system to connect to Xbox Live and the Playstation network (possibly the OAuth system as well but don't quote me on that)<br />
<br />
Now for the Facebook Friend Finder feature I'm not 100% certain of how that works but probably by getting the friends list output from the FB side then battle.net does a database search query for accounts tagged with Facebook enabled tags. There's methods of quickly searching through databases for accounts with tags you just need the right search algorithms and database queries. I'm not a database/algorithm/math geek so I can't bore you to tears with the methods of doing so (maybe a rainbow table??)</div></div><hr />
