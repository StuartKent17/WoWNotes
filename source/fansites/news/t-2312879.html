I would guess, since they are listed as Bind on Account, made for people with alts, who complain about this &quot;alt-unfriendly expansion&quot; so they can do the game on main, get some stuff, buy these, send to alts.<br />

<br />
We were listed as one of the specs that needed changes but for some reason that idea was scrapped and pushed back til later. We come closer to 7.3.5 and they still haven't even really approached us, you would think that since they already put us off once we would be one of the first they would want to start looking at.<br />

IMO though, seeing that T21 Eyebeam effect just screams to me that they are so far out of touch with our class that its stupid to expect anything at this point.</div></div><hr />

Diablo 3 loot is random period. Legion loot (other than pvp gear and what you craft to some extent) is not completely random, only BONUSES are random. You do not need any of those bonuses to clear any of the content, nor does the game demand that you have the best legendaries to complete the content. But let's just say it did, 99% of you are not going to clear it before it's trivialized in some way so you're just bitching because you were probably some try hard on a bad server before, and now that doesn't mean you're gonna have better gear than a casual player necessarily.</div></div><hr />

They give us this huge catch-up mechanic in the form of game-wide AK but legendaries are still very hard to acquire, especially if you don't farm all the available content like a mad man. I mean, i know how long it took me to get all the BM legendaries on my main, i'm not even sure there's enough time left to do that on my alts even if i wanted to.<br />
Looking at the legendary quests from MoP and WoD, they got shorter and shorter, to the point where you could finish it in just a few weeks. But that was one item. It's kinda like that now but instead of getting the cloak or ring you wanted, you get a random one.<br />
So yeah, i hope these tokens are easy enough to get, since they are still just a random legendary-just giving my warrior as an example, she has 4 legendaries, the shoulders, boots, prydaz and KJ's burning wish.</div></div><hr />

Rng has been in the game since vanilla. I know from experience how shit it was to not get that 10-20% weapon or trinket upgrade in several months, if I got them at all. <br />

Legendaries are more akin to Talents. Certain playstyles are locked behind them. They fix some specs at a fundamental level.<br />

Lol.. but you also know legendaries are here, and you get it 100% without any praying, because you get it in the end. I did pray for bis items before, now I know my prayers will be heard in the end.<br />
<br />
See, this logic applies everywhere. You have bis leg to work towards. Work for it. <br />
<br />
And best part, you are not locked to any raid to get your bis item(legendary)</div></div><hr />

Having class assigned could mean they are purchasable. I do hope those legendary tokens are purchased with some kind of currency. There needs to be less RNG in game, not more.<br />
<br />
Otherwise it would make no sense to get token for class you don't need. Though we are dealing with Legion team, so there is a chance it will be yet another lottery.</div></div><hr />

No, that's completely different. Trinkets weren't class specific, only specific for 4 roles and were useful for leveling. Weapons were heirlooms and useful for leveling many alts. That legendary is not heirloom.</div></div><hr />

heirlooms were useful for leveling in the next expansion due to increasing item level and stats, they didn't give any extra experience<br />
legendaries are a couple dozen of levels higher than any other legion gear, so they will remain viable for quite a while in the next expasion's leveling process<br />
and lets not forget that the previously mentioned heirlooms all gave a nice boost to alts even before the levelling began</div></div><hr />

I think the point is to create another way to get legs that's not so RNG, depending on how they drop.</div></div><hr />

Too bad Blizzard missed the boat on the whole craft your own cool legionaries. But then again they never have had a good crafting &quot;game&quot;</div></div><hr />

Legion loot (other than pvp gear and what you craft to some extent) is not completely random, only BONUSES are random. You do not need any of those bonuses to clear any of the content, nor does the game demand that you have the best legendaries to complete the content. But let's just say it did, 99% of you are not going to clear it before it's trivialized in some way so you're just bitching because you were probably some try hard on a bad server before, and now that doesn't mean you're gonna have better gear than a casual player necessarily.<br />
<br />
So much crap together in one post... lol<br />
<br />
Just to fix your statement about D3 loot, it's not random period. The bonuses are fixed to each item. You get random values and stats. Clearly diferent from &quot;random period&quot;.<br />
<br />
The only time the game does not require you to have the legendaries that are actually good for your spec is on trivialized/nerfed bosses or normal mode or starting the heroic mode.<br />
<br />
Don't be stupid.<br />

Rng has been in the game since vanilla. I know from experience how shit it was to not get that 10-20% weapon or trinket upgrade in several months, if I got them at all. <br />
<br />
I understand that RNG sucks sometimes(trust me, I am salty) but legendary rng sucks as gear rng, difference is, legendary you really want you'll get eventually ;)<br />
<br />
RNG for an item drop is one thing, which is not what he was saying.<br />
<br />

Lol.. but you also know legendaries are here, and you get it 100% without any praying, because you get it in the end. I did pray for bis items before, now I know my prayers will be heard in the end.<br />
<br />
See, this logic applies everywhere. You have bis leg to work towards. Work for it. <br />
<br />
And best part, you are not locked to any raid to get your bis item(legendary)<br />
<br />
And that's why the chance to drop is far lower than the items from the raid.<br />
<br />
That's the worst part actually.<br />
<br />
Still waiting for legendaries from 7.0 to drop for me, one of them is now bis again for my spec and each new patch they would keep adding new ones, making it worse.<br />
<br />
At least there won't be any new ones now.</div></div><hr />

If you dont have all legendaries for your main spec and you started at launch, you have been doing something seriously wrong.<br />
<br />
And what was his point again? Wich he wrote, RNG, he complains about the RNG. Before you could get bis items etc bla bla, you still can when it comes to legendary. If you don't want to do your work to collect the legendaries, thats on you.</div></div><hr />

Well I won't start the convo regarding it since it's my personal opinion. Every side has their good and bad points.<br />
<br />
On Topic: my idea is that those tokens might drop in the same way the SoO Heirlooms dropped, where you get 1 token per unsaved character per kill/week.<br />
Of course you'll get the token drop of the Class you kill it with. <br />
Example: I kill it with a Rogue, I get the Rogue token to use on whatever Specc I want on my Rogue(s).</div></div><hr />

How exactly are they obtained, don't tell me they are randomly dropped instead of actual legendaries?<br />
<br />
They're random.<br />
<br />
So it fixes NOTHING.<br />
<br />
It will still just randomly assign you a shit legendary.<br />

Sorry bro.<br />

Some of us don't want to mindlessly grind 12 month old raids on 4 different difficulties. The content is old and shit. Why aren't we rewarded for playing CURRENT content?<br />
<br />
You're basically playing the game like a loser.</div></div><hr />

Argus appears to be a decent source for leggos, but I agree. No sane person is going to run LFR forever willingly.<br />
<br />
Tbh, blizz should just use the Destiny 2 &quot;legendary&quot; system. Yeah, it's a bit grindy, but at least you have somewhat of a choice and it isn't completely terrible... Or at least way better than the Legion one.</div></div><hr />

I spent enough time on Argus to get bored of it with my Shaman Alt, to gear him for Antorus. Which admittedly wasn't that long - because Argus is shit.<br />
<br />
I did this because 7.3.2 has zero class balancing changes and 7.3.5 is nowhere to be found. So my Havoc DH is benched.<br />
<br />
My Shaman still has 1 CRAFTED legendary equipped and is 917 iLevel. I still haven't received my first OR second. And I won't, because I'm unsubbed.</div></div><hr />

You dont know how I play the game. The loser is the one who think you need to do all raids on 4 difficulties to get the most chance on legendaries. Do current content and get one every week or two. <br />
<br />
That you fail to get legendaries is on you, seems you are doing it all wrong.</div></div><hr />

I know right? I opened a couple emissary boxes a few weeks back and got 2 legendaries. These filthy causals just don't know how to play the game.</div></div><hr />
