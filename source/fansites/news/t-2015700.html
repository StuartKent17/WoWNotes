Legion Dungeon Hero and several other dungeon achievements now require you to complete them in Mythic rather than Heroic.Ouch. This was something I thought about in WoD, stomping through Heroics for achievements seemed too easy.<br />

And getting those would simply mean visits to vendors for the most part.<br />

Time will tell how realistic that increased amount is to achieve though.<br />
Multiple characters will be required I suspect, which is really the way it should be on the slots where a character can only use a fraction of the possibilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, if you want to go by &quot;popularity&quot; being tied to subscriptions, the game had a lot more growth during Vanilla (8M) and TBC (3M). Wrath is when it stagnated (Growth of ~1M). Wrath stagnated WoW. Wether it was because of being more casual-friendly or not we don't know, even though it's unlikely.<br />
<br />
The truth is that being more or less casual friendly does have some influence on popularity and subscription numbers, but there are far too many other factors and variables involved to draw any linear relation between individual design choices of the game on a given time period and the number of subscriptions that period had.</div></div><hr />

I still think they'll be missing a trick if they don't add tiered achievements so one for 100 in each slot, one for 150, 250 etc, with the exception of tabards + shirts which I think would be reasonable to cap at around 40-50. This is going to be a huge collection system like mounts, pets, toys etc, so it makes sense to make it work in a similar way. With different tiers there come different levels for different players to aim for, depending on their dedication to collecting, and that's definitely what the wardrobe needs imo!</div></div><hr />

All those achievements are usually done with premade group and the main difference between heroic and mythic difficulties is that second one can not be queued via LFD.

<br />
Except you went off on a tangent about casuals 'getting handed everything', so I wondered if there was something specific in these patch notes that you were complaining about.<br />
<br />
But no, I guess you're just a common or garden variety jackass. I'll leave you to your futile rage.<br />

<br />
I can't claim full credit, I was thinking of a Simpsons episode where they showed a newspaper clipping of Grandpa with the headline 'old man yells at clouds'.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me quote my comment: &quot;Casuals should just accept that they won't always get shit handed to them at any possible occasion and this is coming from someone who went from hardcore to casual. Do I deserve all possible items if I don't raid Mythic anymore or don't do hardcore PvP? Hell no. I accept that I'm missing out on shit, because I went casual. Should I get Tier Epics, because I can close my eyes, tie my hands behind my back and faceplant my keyboard in LFR? No.<br />
<br />
People have gotten spoiled, because this is the logic that a lot of modern games go by. Nothing can be prestigious, nothing can be unobtainable, because otherwise &quot;I&quot; won't have it. Everyone who says differently is of course a &quot;special snowflake&quot;. Get real.&quot;<br />
<br />
Where did I mention that they ruined the game? Did I even use the word &quot;ruin&quot;? No. Am I raging, like you are implying? No. I am adding my opinion to an argument that is being held in the comments, but you feeling all superior and whatnot are turning it around in your favor, because making up shit I didn't say is the only way you can argue and be... no -feel- that you are right.<br />
<br />
Again, since you seem to not understand, my comment was referring to the discussion in the comments and not the patch notes in particular. If you cannot be bothered to read through the comments, read my comment properly or twist it in your favor, just don't bother commenting at all. You having a different opinion on which direction you feel the game should be heading in doesn't make your opinion right or wrong. Nor does it make mine right or wrong. That is why it is called an &quot;opinion&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I read the comments. Several times. Apart from referencing casuals, your comment doesn't relate to anything anyone else says. Nobody said anything about anyone being handed anything. It's a complete tangent from the rest of the thread. <br />
<br />
And no, I never said you used 'ruin', that's basically what else was being said about casuals. Maybe you should read the comments?<br />
<br />
But hey, you do you.</div></div><hr />

Nope. Nor did anyone complain about not being able to receive a certain artifact skin, because it was from raiding Mythic. Nope. You probably also didn't use blah, blah casuals are ruining the game in reference to my comment which you didn't read at the time, right? Hence, leading to me saying that I did not imply or say that.<br />
<br />
Keep struggling with your superiority complex.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I used 'blah, blah' in reference to the 'casuals are killing the game' comments others made. I was dismissing the prior 'discussion'. I never said you, in particular, said or implied it. <br />
<br />
As for the rest, it's perspective and semantics. I don't see it the way you do. Whatever.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apexis</div><div class="date">2016-06-22, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait, what? Does that mean we have to do these achievements in Mythic now?<br />
<br />
Crap, that was the artifact skin that I was really hoping to get. :(<br />
<br />
Whether or not these are a much easier version of Mythic plus. The fact remains that not enough people did the dungeons in WoD, so now they are going to pigeon whole the entire player base into doing Mythic dungeons whether they really want to or not to get various achievements and items. <br />
<br />
They never ever give up on forcing play where people trying to avoid them like a plague. I doubt many will want to spend time going back to the days of having to form group to do dungeons. This is how we ended up with the horrid queue system that they never really fixed from the start. <br />
<br />
Blizzard never ever give up on trying to mix the water and oil together in this game. They love pushing people with less skill in with people with more skill. The end result always being people getting pissed off and the social wars start all over again, the yelling and screaming, the endless name calling. Why? After all these years do they not get it that they have two entirely separate player bases that do not like one another and never ever get along with each other.</div></div><hr />

I don't care what other MMOs do. I'm specifically comparing vanilla and bc to now. They are literally throwing legendaries at us for killing trash mobs. It's like Bernie Sanders is in charge of development.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If by popular, you mean 12M players, its worth noting that 11.6M of them never raided. Without casuals there is no game.</div></div><hr />

Yeah totally worthless to craft gear that is as strong as HC Raid gear (if it will be like in WOD)<br />

Last time I checked, crafts only go up to 850, which is normal level raids, not heroic.</div></div><hr />

So you would rather have it so that legendaries only got funneled to about 1 person per guild so they can act like a special snowflake?<br />
<br />
No wonder you are upset about it</div></div><hr />

I would yes, and I was never chosen so this wouldn't benefit me anyways. They're legendary they're supposed to be very rare. Orange is the new blue.</div></div><hr />
