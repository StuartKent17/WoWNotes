What shall a shadow say? Whenever you read something about priests it's 95% about healer...and the remaining 5% is either taking away an ability from shadows or adding another &quot;you need orbs for this spell too now&quot;-feature.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Yep, it usually means that melees are balanced vs. mages...ignoring the fact that not all ranges have 150k abilities to get melees off their butts...and as a result everyone but mages being slaughtered by melees in the end.<br />
I'd be seriously surprised if shadows would do any better(or in other words: Have a chance) in WoD in 1vs.1 than they did in MoP, Cata, Wotlk or BC(and yeah, blizzard, you failed for a whooping 4 expansions by now. Impressive streak.).</div></div><hr />

Hmm currently on beta my warrior is dual weilding some sweet 630 axes i made with Blacksmith and only requires lvl 91. They are boe. Does not require bs or nothing, just take about 7 days to make 1. You can only wear 3 of this sweet crafted items, the armor is ilvl 620, so i replaced her flex boots. Some follower missions already awarded some 610 armor and she is will lvl 93. Hum....

<br />
I really hope Blizz improved (a lot) this feature in terms of fun... Because the current one is repetitive, time-consuming and pointless for people that have been playing for a while.<br />
<br />
Maybe the free weapon removes the &quot;pointless&quot; from the equation, but still repetitive and time-consuming (aka: not fun) if similar to current one.</div></div><hr />

Well aren't you lucky? :) they might talk about shamans more often and as a result we end up with more nerfs than anything else especially elemental.To be honest i dread the moment blizz starts making changes again to shamans because all they do is nerf...nerf...nerf...nerf buff alittle bit here...And than i see how mages and warlocks (The last 2 builds) keep on getting mainly buffs apparently we are going to enjoy yet another expansion where they are 10-20 % infront of the rest of the range dps (with the exception of hunters) isn't that going to be a nice change?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it never mattered which version you got unless you were progressing end game MoP<br />
<br />
However, the scaling for each level gained to 100 is different and having a higher difficulty heirloom will benefit you in this sense, just no one gets a higher ILVL at max level 100.</div></div><hr />

You don't need 615 to complete Bronze. I did it in quest gear shortly after hitting 90 as a ret paladin, a class and spec I don't usually play. Completing Bronze is pretty easy and you get a shiny 610 weapon.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, bronze is very easy, even if you are a bit undergeared.</div></div><hr />

I was doing &quot;heroic&quot; dungeons the other night, watching people in raid gear put up sub 50k dps, which at this point is just ridiculous. I realize that me putting up 6-10x that level of dps at this point is trivial, but I think it's time again for people to be tiered according to their ability rather than pushed into groups with those that are outright carrying them. That's not good for the future of the game as these people will never learn how to play the game unless they're tasked with learning it and required to take an extra step to prove they are tall enough to step on the ride. Although, this may backfire because the average tank/healer is probably incapable of completing Silver, and will lead to queues. Time will tell.</div></div><hr />

Proving Grounds in WoD give the exact same titles as the current ones?<br />
That's hardly an incentive to do it again in WoD; I'm somewhat disappointed.</div></div><hr />

The MM 2-set bonus was more than an 8% dps increase, it was too strong (regardless how good or bad MM was at that point).</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, <br />
the complaint: &quot;lone wolf MM hunter survivability is nonexistent. Other classes can tank extreme dmg, you are instant dead as hunter, in a stun.&quot; <br />
is a funny one. <br />
<br />
For years hunters have been whining that they wanted a petless hunter. Well, now you're getting it. Expecting to keep the same ability we currently have to run around and tank everything is pretty silly. I mean really, you begged to get rid of the part of the class that did the tanking for you.</div></div><hr />
