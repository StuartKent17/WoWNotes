Part of the reason why I will at some point do a full reinstall.<br />

And achieve what ?<br />
It isn't likely to contain anything much different from the PTR.<br />
And in the case of major cinematics, blizzard have implemented a new strategy of not giving you quite the full data, with part of it being downloaded on-demand to prevent spoilers.</div></div><hr />

Your install will get bigger forever until there is some kind of garbage collection. My Beta install went from 58gb back down to 38gb when I reinstalled.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because they have stopped it.<br />
It won't progress, and likely won't even when they do reintroduce it due to a high likelihood of further changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well it does contain pretty much the whole expansion, stuff that isn't available during pre-patch or not available straight away is just ''locked behind a switch'' so the size is what you expect, pre patches always been between 14 and 20gb or so if I remember right.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you here, but this is the expansion of many things happening that have never happened before. 2 raid tiers, announcing an expansion outside Blizzcon, an arena season starting the same day as it ended, who knows what Blizzard will do anymore.</div></div><hr />

I have to correct myself, the downloader reached the last 2 gb now and suddenly went up to 80-100%<br />
that's really odd...<br />

I think this makes August 2nd look really unlikely now too, since they wouldn't push it out this early if that was the plan. So I'd say 90% for July 26th, maybe an outside 10% chance at the 19th if they go away from the 2 week pvp early warning rule.</div></div><hr />

Point is, the older GPU's can handle it just fine. I have full intentions of upgrading GPU's once they go on sale later this year, but it's hardly an emergency. I pretty much roll around with Legion set to 8 most of the time, and slide it up to 10 when I want to take screenshots. I meant to slide it down to 6 the other day when I ran LFR testing, but I forgot by the time the queue popped and ran the whole thing on 8. Never lagged or skipped a beat.</div></div><hr />

It would actually lose about ~10gb or so when you do a clean re-install after 7.0 is live. Right now with the pre-load content, that size is expected.<br />

I have the equivalent of a GTX 750 Ti, and it gets me 4/10 with CMAA in Legion content. How is that recommended? They should recommend at least twice the GPU performance and an i5-6500, and of course 8GB RAM, which is now stupidly cheap.<br />
<br />
750 Ti and 4GB is recommended (as in decent settings) not ultra. You could easily run the game on super high settings with those parts though.

Some says that WOD pre patch was available for download 3 weeks before it went live. Wonder if it will be the same story this time?<br />
I hope not! :) want it live as fast as possible, because it will give time for the demon invasion - that stuff escalate every week as the plan is (over time as blizzard said) <br />

That's what I was wondering as well, but only Blizzard knows. A lot of people have been thinking it will be the 19th for some reason.

<br />
Blizzard announces the ending of a PvP season with a 2 week notice. The season ends before or when the Pre-patch hits. Therefore we need a season end announcement 2 weeks before the pre-patch. If they keep their usual schedule, 19th of July is out.<br />

Did you changed in Battlenet app settings &quot;Game install/update&quot; tab and scroll down and Future Patch data to &quot;0&quot; (unlimited speed). It's set 100 kbps as default. :)</div></div><hr />

Was a tweet on blizzard twitter last week that has since been removed that confirmed release to be on the 19th.<br />
<br />
Sure.. and there was also a tweet that everyone will get Legion for free if they didn't have it yet. Just as likely to have been removed.</div></div><hr />

Youll have no problem if you do the 7.0 prepatch events. They give out 700 gear.<br />

And yes it will be enough Noobadin.</div></div><hr />

Not surprising - the game is in it's 6th(?) expansion and tons of content!<br />

without screenshots, addons and logs mine is at 51,4GB<br />

Shadows kill it for most people, but it's so hard to play with the little black circle &quot;shadow&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have found, that shadows and SSAO (HBAO+), as well as object draw distance (only in open world) are the most demanding options you can alter.</div></div><hr />

Seems like 27. July or 03. August will be the big date. I am quite happy if it's latter, the prepatch will make the Garrisons pretty useless :/. <br />

Well, at least I can thoroughly test all Speccs for my Warlock and go through all Talent Options, and decide which will be my mainspecc for Legion ;D.</div></div><hr />

The season ends before or when the Pre-patch hits. Therefore we need a season end announcement 2 weeks before the pre-patch. If they keep their usual schedule, 19th of July is out.<br />
<br />
Is that a rule or something? It makes sense to end it before pre patch since all the classes will be drastically changing and what not, but TD ultimately blizzards decision as to whether they want to adhere to that two week notice. I don't even know what a pvp &quot;season&quot; is, so feel free to ignore me. </div></div><hr />

seasons are all but pointless in legion anyways considering pvp and pve gear are the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a ridiculous joke, i need to watch someone play wow and tell me to take pictures of some npc to get a Beta key 2 weeks before pre-patch hits? I would much rather see Blizz not wasting time, and &quot;minimal&quot; effort on this and maybe they could spend some time doing paper work to fire Chris Metzen just like Ghostcrawler.</div></div><hr />

Judging by what they did when WoD was in beta, Blizzard will add the in-game cinematics last and then put the videos up on their YouTube channel.</div></div><hr />

I have 150 MBit (18.75 MB/s max) internet and WoW is claiming it's downloading at 21 MB/s. I'm guessing it's the same &quot;bug&quot; that Steam used to have where compressed files are downloaded and then unpacked; speed indicating the amount of unpacked data that is written to your hard disc.<br />
<br />
I DL at 6.5 MB/S but it's download 8+ for me.. steam does the same thing more than my max</div></div><hr />
