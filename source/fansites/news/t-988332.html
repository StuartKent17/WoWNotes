Proving Your Worth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29801/proving-your-worth/)<br />
Objective - Pickpocket a cryptomancer's decoder ring from a Twilight Sorceror at the Azure Dragonshrine within the Dragon's Soul raid encounter. <br />
Description - Hello, [name]! You've earned a reputation among the flight as having - shall we say - 'nimble fingers.' We need someone of your skills for a matter of utmost delicacy. Before I reveal more, we need to know you're the right [man/woman] for the job. <br />
<br />
When the course of battle takes you to the Azure Dragonshrine, I need you to pickpocket the Twilight Sorcerors until you discover a cryptomancer's decoder ring. Are you up to the task?<br />
<br />
A Hidden Message (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29802/a-hidden-message/)<br />
Objective - Charge your Cryptomancer's Decoder Ring and use it to decode the Corastrasza's Singed Cipher.<br />
Description - Corastrasza, currently stationed at the Vermillion Redoubt in the Twilight Highlands, has intercepted a coded message of grave importance. I'll let her explain the full situation, but we need your expertise to unravel the cipher! <br />
<br />
Take your decoder ring to an ethereal thurmaturge in your capital city - he should know how to charge it. Acquire the encoded cipher from Corastrasza and use the ring to decode it for her. Hurry! Time is ticking... <br />
<br />
To Ravenholdt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29934/to-ravenholdt/)<br />
Objective - Speak to Mostrasz at the Vermillion Redoubt and fly to Ravenholdt Manor together. <br />
Description - If the egg is in Ravenholdt Manor, we can't risk torching it in an all-out assault. I'll need someone slippery to get in there and find out for sure. That's you, [name]. <br />
<br />
Mostrasz will help you infiltrate the compound. Speak to him just outside and fly to Ravenholdt together. Good luck!<br />
<br />
To Catch a Thief (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29847/to-catch-a-thief/)<br />
Objective - Infiltrate Ravenholdt Manor and locate the missing black dragon egg.<br />
Description - Just beyond this cave lies Ravenholdt Manor. You need to get inside without being seen! <br />
<br />
*Mostrasz places an enchantment on you.* <br />
<br />
There - now I'll be able to keep an eye on you and communicate as you venture into the compound. Now sneak into that manor, locate the egg, and don't get caught...<br />
<br />

Patch 4.3 Updated Spell Effects - Shadow Bolt, Lightning Bolt, Wrath<br />
A couple of classes are getting updated spell effects in this patch, http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid, http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman, and http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock are the lucky winners of new spell effects! <br />
<br />
Priests are also supposed to get a new effect for Divine Aegis but the new version doesn't seem to be implemented on test realms yet. <br />
<br />

They said they removed aegis effect due to concern of screen cluttering, and then they add some new eye candy effects on other existing spells. This in addition to things they already changed on live AFTER removing the aegis bubbles such as: - a trinket that summons a meteor from the sky - a solar beam that shines with multiple particles instead of a pure light beam - mushrooms that have multiple layers of small dots) I don't trust what they write anymore.</div></div><hr />

It looks like the dummy just absorbs it which makes it seem like &quot;He's shooting gold sparklies at me! Tee hee!&quot; instead of a nasty blast of nature. Lightning bolt and Shadow Bolt both look great though. The fading color change in the tail of SB is a really nice effect. The skull is pretty ridiculous, But that's what I really love about it. Lightning bolt is a more refined version of an already pretty nice effect. And they both go splat when they hit. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I would. Sure it looks dated, but it looks good for being dated. This new model doesn't even have a projectile, it's just a particle stream. In fact, this looks much like the particle used for prayer of mending. Not like wrath.</div></div><hr />

Also that dagger ... Tentacles? :rolleyes: And in 3rd stage it looks kinda ridiculous, I assume it's not yet finished (especially the lovely glow from 2nd stage being replaced with some strange frame).<br />

<br />
this is your opinion and from that repsonse i take it you don't play one. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think the daggers look awesome because they're to do with deathwing and the old gods and they're imbued with the vial of the old gods i think is what was posted and the transformation is to do with the change of death wing.<br />
<br />
I was hoping for the flight form to be the wings as casters get teragoca flight form. but being able to use them as a slow fall is still cool enough for me. bring on the legendary !</div></div><hr />

Guess they are trying to tie in all our spells with the whole Solar/Lunar thing.<br />
<br />
Sunfire is orange/yellow and wraths still green, so they are trying to make it fit more into the Solar feel side.<br />
I see what they are trying to do and I'm all for it. I just feel this newest effect lacks something.</div></div><hr />

Wrath is absolutely shit looking compared to lightning bolt. <br />
(and it should be green, that stupid yellow firefly ball doesn't fit well near any of my other spells on the action bar :P) <br />
<br />
I hope they do something for starfire too, i still have to understand what it's effect is supposed to be...when i fight a boss i see only a splashing light on the ground :S <br />
<br />
On the ptr it seems they have changed the appearance of starfall too...it seems like it is missing the burning aura around the comet &quot;bullet&quot; <br />
They have also changed the reforging UI, now it uses round checkboxes instead of scrolldown menu</div></div><hr />

Not all people are primarily visual, you may be auditory or kinesthetic mainly when it comes to senses, and simply not see what we see. The majority find the art to be bad, and it is.<br />

The exceptions are people who have deviating tastes compared to the rest of the public, and people who just aren't very visual and don't give a crap.</div></div><hr />

I meant you won't since legendaries can't be mogged in any way, whether it's copying from or changing them.<br />
<br />
I still think perdition's blade is the standard for how you make an amazing looking dagger. After they changed the model to what it currently is they really stood out. You could be standing in a crowded Org and they would catch your eye. But I do like the look of these, I think the gold outlining of the final version will look better in game.</div></div><hr />

if you have no need to finish the daggers you could pimp it to the second form, which is potentially NOT legendary and use it for later mogging. <br />
That way, you would have AWESOME daggers, close to the legandary look, even for later raiding content, while the finished legendary will get you some nice wings without TRUE benefits and weapons you MUST put away quite soon.</div></div><hr />

While I agree that it looks like a priest spell now the color scheme has to do with Balance not only having to do with nature but also trading of the use of power from the Sun (wrath, sunfire) and the Moon (starfire, moonfire). Though I do think that they should have gone for a sunfire colored wrath and not golden cause golden just yells &quot;holy&quot; to me.</div></div><hr />

It's mostly the same but more polished. The skull is a bit more cartoony but it's nothing major. Good job overall.<br />
<br />
However, I think Wrath looks very boring. Also I think the colour green was more fitting for a Druid.<br />
And as for Lightning Bolt, I think the new one looks really bad. Especially the weird effect that shrinks in size over a short time. It doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

Dagger...nice if one liked AQ patch I guess..<br />

Wrath is supposed to be a spell dedicated to sunlight.<br />
<br />
It makes sense for it to be yellow. It needs to be a little more light-based, though.</div></div><hr />

if you have no need to finish the daggers you could pimp it to the second form, which is potentially NOT legendary and use it for later mogging. <br />
That way, you would have AWESOME daggers, close to the legandary look, even for later raiding content, while the finished legendary will get you some nice wings without TRUE benefits and weapons you MUST put away quite soon.<br />
you realise going from runestaff of nordrassil to dragonwrath, while only a 6 ilvl upgrade, adds ~15-20% overall damage right? you realise that a mid-to-high-end geared rogue will be pulling ~55-60k dps every second the 'doesn't consume combo points' proc is up, even before counting the modifier to finisher damage and the stacking agi bonus, neither of which we have official numbers for, which could easily add a huge amount more dps? saying going from stage two to the legendary stage three has no 'true' benefit is ridiculous, it'll be a HUGE bonus, well within the range of 10-20% dps depending on what numbers they finally allocate to the uptime of the combo-point proc, the stacking agi buff, and the increased finisher damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, of course NOW it will have it's benefits on dps, but while all the other stuff can still be used for mogging, if you like, that's impossible for legendaries.<br />
So you will only see legendaries in cities, for posing, once they are outdated.<br />
I'm quite aware, that the final item is great and maybe I would look differently on it, if it wasnt the last raid of this adon already.<br />
But let's say it like this:<br />
Most rogues will propably be able to obtain the 2nd stage instead of the final, so why not just be happy with these daggers ?<br />
They're still good for actual content, look better than the final version and can be used for mogging.<br />
<br />
If you're a pro, you will propably have this piece finished rather quickly and you want the DPS.<br />
If you're slower, you would maybe get it done around the end of the expansion, which makes them look outdated, even before the end.</div></div><hr />

Dragonwrath now is really hard to end in its content in 10-man. But it's okay with a pre-end-content stuff, because you can use it in the next. But with this dagger it would be stupid. I agree to not to make guilds split their team into 2 or 3 10-mans (to be honest: i don't know if any 25-man guild would change their way of raiding, because of some1's loot...). I think the proper rate would be 3:2 in 25- and 10-mans (not that 5:2 like with the staff). But i don't really care, we don't have a rogue in our 10-man team...:P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally like stage 2 more. the final form makes me think &quot;squidblade&quot;<br />
<br />
Edit; This just came to me, The most ironic part of the final form looking like a squid is that blizz said &quot;how silly would it be to transmog a dagger to look like a fish&quot; I think the real reason they didnt want people to do that is it would infringe on their later idea's for later legendaries!!! the next one &quot;the swordfishsword!&quot; xD hahaha</div></div><hr />

However being a Druid, I'm not a big fan of the wrath changes. It's supposed to be a nature spell, and it doesn't look very &quot;naturey&quot; with the golden look. I do appreciate them trying to give us a little change, but I think they could do something much better. Wrath looks almost as lame as Starsurge now.</div></div><hr />

The trail effect is nice though. Lightning bolt I think everybody can agree with, looks great, seems to glitch though on side view. Lastly, wrath, I feel the same way as I did with shadow bolt. There was actually a projectile of some sort being launched, now its this orange/yellow color flashlight beams. Deadly rays of light *turns on flashlight and throws dust*.</div></div><hr />

Second of all i think it's a shame that they changed shaman, warlock and druid filler nukes without changeing the perhaps most borring spell filler of all. I am of course talking about mindflay. I mea have you ever seen a more dull spell effect? It could at least have some sort of special effeect when it hits the target.<br />

I do hope that they will change this soon with the rest of the range dps filler nukes.</div></div><hr />
