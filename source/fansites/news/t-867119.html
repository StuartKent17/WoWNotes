Cataclysm - Heroic Zul'Gurub Dungeon and Boss Guide 
Jesse Cox from OMFGcata released a nice video of the updated version of Zul'gurub. If you didn't have time to visit the new instance on PTRs, you should probably spend 15 minutes watching it, you will probably end up thinking &quot;hey, the new ZG is better than I thought!&quot;.

Patch 4.1: Addon Messages Will Be Filtered<br />
Boring stuff you will probably not understand unless you're an addon developer, but it seems important! <br />
Addon authors that use chat messages should check that their addons still work in 4.1<br />
<br />
Authors will need to add calls to RegisterAddonMessagePrefix() in order to receive addon messages of a particular prefix, presumably during PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD for the majority of addons. Note that this system errs on the side of sending too much; it is possible for addon messages to make it to the CHAT_MSG_ADDON handlers when no addon has registered it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
RegisterAddonMessagePrefix( &amp;lt;string&amp;gt; )<br />
<br />
Returns a boolean if successful (could fail if it hits the client side limit of 512 prefixes).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
IsAddonMessagePrefixRegistered( &amp;lt;string&amp;gt; )<br />
<br />
Returns a Boolean if the prefix has been registered.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;table&amp;gt; GetRegisteredAddonMessagePrefixes( &amp;lt;table&amp;gt; )<br />
<br />
Returns a table (or you can pass in a table), that will be filled in with all prefixes that were registered.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Prefixes are limited to 16 characters now, and they no longer take up a portion of the 256 character chat message limit. The server has a 64 prefix limit. If you exceed this limit your client will not filter any messages.<br />
<br />
Also: SendAddonMessage() is now allowed for the OFFICER channel.<br />
<br />

Winged Raids and Firelands<br />
A developer working on a particularly awesome Firelands boss encounter today took me on a tour of the dungeon. I think you'll find the layout to be a pleasant change of pace from winged dungeons. Many of the mechanics being worked on that I was shown were quite nifty as well. I'm really excited for this one. ;) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/163408/can-we-have-less-winged-raids))<br />
<br />
Quest Phasing<br />
This is the sort of philosophy we're going for with phasing, as we do feel it's an important tool for storytelling. We do recognize issues where we've &quot;over-phased&quot; zones in the past though, and we generally tried to take a more minimal approach to phasing in Cataclysm. While there is still a good deal of phasing involved in many of the zones, we tried to make each phase a little more intricate and less intrusive on group gameplay. We want to make sure that, in times when a group is required, phasing doesn't hold you back from grouping with friends. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/163327/phasing-a-huge-mistake))<br />
<br />
Phased Ore/Herbs<br />
It is an issue we're aware of and having been looking into. We've applied a number of hotfixes to phased gathering nodes since the release of Cataclysm, but this one is still there and is certainly a bugger. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/163327/phasing-a-huge-mistake))<br />
<br />
Appearance Tab - Using other items visuals while keeping your real gear<br />
We have discussed these types of ideas with the developers several times in recent history. We're not entirely opposed to some of the ideas, though the feature would probably be more limited than the functionality many players are asking for.<br />
<br />
This is still largely a contested concept though, as we'd want to make sure it's done well and doesn't have unforeseen negative impacts on gameplay/art style. When we have more information to share with you regarding our decision whether or not to move forward, and how, we'll be sure to let you know.

I know they don't want the work of the designers to go to waste if a lot of people wear older gear for the visuals, but I do think it'll make WoW feel a bit more diverse and alive. Right now almost every member of each class look similar to one another.<br />
<br />
I'd love to have my warlock run around with my Tier 5 set for visuals, even if I am wearing Tier 11 for real.<br />
<br />
The only real limitation I'd see is with weapons. I think a lot of people would be satisfied if we could just have different armor for visuals and always use our real weapons for visuals.</div></div><hr />

I think the thing that scares them is most classes would probably have a T? set that they love such as T6 for hunter / lock or ofc T2 for paladin but the up side to this has to be that they would need to make new teir gear look really awsome and it would only make the game look cooler<br />
<br />
on a side note, they could add that you need to have aquired the item in order to display the skin which would make people go back to old content but not force since its purely an appearance thing and holds no stat changes</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. th3n nobody will wear the super awesome T11 armor QQ (well maybe because a lot of people don't like it)<br />
2. people will wear ugly gear<br />
<br />
My answer:<br />
<br />
1. make good looking armor sets again you cheap bastards and realize that not everyone is wearing the newest tier sets, it is great that raiders have something good looking but the rest is fucked at least in dungeons.<br />
2. Not really since you can't dye your gear and if I wanted to put the most stupid looking armor on I can already do that in cities.</div></div><hr />

It will affect PvP. <br />

The only real limitation I'd see is with weapons. I think a lot of people would be satisfied if we could just have different armor for visuals and always use our real weapons for visuals.<br />
When I don't like the art, I don't care about it going to waste.<br />
Which is the case with each and every tier gear since BC. I really don't understand how the artists can make lower level gear that I like and tier gear that I hate so much for the same game. If given the option, I would rather sport the look of the initial gear of lv1 characters than the latest tear, so lame I find the tier gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Something I would like very much, thank you.<br />
<br />
It would add uncertainty for gankers.<br />
<br />
If it was left to me, I would go even further: block inspect and knowing the level, total health, and total power for other faction players. Let gankers wonder if that seemingly AFK player in a lowbie zone is really a lowbie, or a disguised PvPer just waiting to turn the tables on any attacker.<br />
<br />
Even for arenas and other forms of organized PvP. It would make for more player-driven uncertainty, in turn making PvP more exciting and uncertain.<br />
<br />
And you know what?<br />
<br />
Most of my characters in DCUO and LotRO mostly sport the gear look of lowbie (often lv1) characters. I don't care at all about looking powerful, I only care about my character being pleasant to look at for me.<br />

Which, unfortunately, is something I can't do in WoW. It's one of the reasons I had made a lowbie character to post in the forums; I didn't want my avatar to be wearing tier gear.</div></div><hr />

You simply add a check box &quot;Hide Custom Gear Appearance&quot; so the PvP'ers can't be whiny babies when they do something stupid like this.<br />
If all you look at is someones gear when you try to gank them, you deserve it in the first place.</div></div><hr />

A full remap..? really...? It's the same place it always was. It had no logical reason to change at all.<br />
<br />
I admit they should have at the very least ammped up the textures to match todays textures but in all honesty to expect a full remap is asking too much. I'd be more worried about ZA that didn't change at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying the people I did the instance with on the PTR were good players but it didn't seem as bad as you make it.. My first try none of the group had done it and we wiped a couple times. Maybe you should spend less time preparing for bosses... i have never watched a video guide, read up on boss abilities or asked someone to explain a boss to me.. If it's not explained in vent I go in blind most of the time and because of that I find things a lot more challenging then the average player does. <br />
<br />
<br />
Don't get mad because your full raid gear still out gears a new sub-tier in the game.. go do those instances on a 333 premade and not a 359 geared character copy from live and tell me how you feel about it, because the instance is designed for people at about 333 ilvl maybe a little higher.<br />

You could turn it off if you are such a coward that you only want to pvp against weaker enemies (aka ganking). It also wouldn't be active in BG and arena.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mainly for pvp. A lot of players use the opponenets visuals as part of their strategy. I think Blizzard doesn´t want players to be able to hide their gear in pvp settings. At least that is what Blizzard said a few years ago. I also kinda agree with it even in social settings. If you want to walk into town looking poor or a certain way, then you should take off your plate armor. The gear swapper makes it easy to do.<br />
<br />
This is something I think has no justiification to be implemented. It is easy enough to accomplish ingame now.. and the only real use people would have for it was to deceive people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for &quot;EVERYONE WILL WEAR THE SAME THING!&quot; I think you're sorely mistaken, i know lots of people that would avoid judgment recolour or T6 warrior, especially since, again, in the thread the suggestion is against being able to use things you can't normally use, like other classes Tier.

<br />
- Slower/lower bandwidth clients will no longer be bogged down by addon message spam that they're receiving even if they don't use the addon. This is especially nice since every addon that looks for messages has to handle all of said incoming messages, even if it's just long enough to determine &quot;Nope, not for me.&quot; <br />
<br />
- Certain addons like EPGP Lootmaster that are intended to keep details between officers can now use the officer channel to share data rather than sending the data via raid or guild channels. A lot of loot systems by design don't want raiders to know what other raiders are expressing interest on an item (or how much DKP they're bidding/etc) but still need officers to know for loot council/etc decisions.<br />
<br />
The bad news is that all addons that do talk/listen are going to be broken until they're patched -- though it sounds like it'd be trivial to write an addon that effectively undoes the change for short-term compatibility while you wait for updates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Banshees are dead, but are incoporeal. Sylvanas also re-posessed her original body some time before she formed the Forsaken, and it wasn't &quot;poof, I'm reincarnated and/or I ran back to my corpse and I'm alive again&quot;. She's dead, dude, and wearing the skin like an Egger Suit. Some of the earliest concept art by Metzen actually shows her with a stitched up sorta patchwork Black Jack face. It's the in-game Deader Barbie look and the creepy goth kid fanart of her that has spawned all these sexy pinups.<br />
<br />
OT: I'm all for an appearance tab done intelligently. (Not unlike how it's handled in LotRO, with the exception of if it's equipped in a costume slot, it's &quot;equipped&quot; and doesn't get to float around in your inventory or bank for you to accidentally vendor or destroy.) Hell, I'd be down with it expressly for the ability to not have to wear a 300-pound chainmail skirt as an enhancement shaman. Dude, it's an accident waiting to happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That way if I want to run around in a full twill set on my priest he will still have the raid stats needed. This also has the benefit of people running old content to get gear they enjoy the look of. I have been advocating this for years.<br />

WOW isn't just a pvp game.... PVE is dying in WOW atm. The guild system is actually hurting the game alot for casual ppl cause many guilds dont manage to get full groups for raids anymore (many lost intrest) and those few that are still around are sorta forced to stay in their guild cause of the rep system. About half of my guild has quit in the past 2 weeks. Same trend is going all over the server. Guilds that had max 49 online every night are now down to less than 20.. and many of them have stopped raiding - exept 2-3 hardcore ones. <br />
<br />
ZG and ZA will be a nightmare for the casual gamer. Most players have already got quite a few 359 items and those 353 are an insult in so many ways... now 4 months into the expansion. Other raiding content is not worth another 4 months and BLizzard must be crazy thinking it will do so. Cause like I said.. guilds are strugling to get ppl to show up. <br />
<br />
Yes .. thats how boring it is atm. ANd ZG and ZA will just make it worse. Those two rewamped instances are the reason I will not resub for the next 4 months. I wont miss anything at all. Its just not wort the time nor the money.... I will do it once or twice later if I deside to resub. Thats how unimpressive this 4.1 patch feels for me.</div></div><hr />

4.1 will be coming about 5 months after the launch of Cataclysm expansion - the content... is 2 rewamped raid dungeons into 5 man content.<br />

<br />
Basically, we will be allowed to change the two major colours of our gear, whilst accessories such as chains and so on will retain their colour.<br />
<br />
That way everyone will be able to keep their gear individual looking and art isn't lost. That would also by far be the best solution.<br />

So you can mix and match those colours to make it look alot different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main reason I personally would like an appearance tab is simply because Blizzard's gear designers forget alot of things. For example, if I'm remembering right, there is no heroic level plate dps belt to match the warrior tier set. Or how none of the agility leather belts match druid sets. Or how most prot paladins are mixed in thirds, DK-, warrior-, and pally-style and NONE of the plate tanking boots match up with their tier set (or belt for tanking, or boots for ret.... you get the point.)<br />
<br />
Bottom line, Blizzard forgot to design gear properly, period. And an appearance tab would cover their lazy asses. So even if they restricted it to dyes, I think I should be allowed to change the skin at least to some other design of that current tier. And before you even point out the pvp implications of this, again, it could be turned off for arena's and rated BGs or whatever, and who gives a damn about ganking besides fools anyways. Protip: you are higher level, you are going to win, if griefing someone over the internet gives you a rubbery one, you need to grow up.:cool:<br />

<br />
Is that a threat? Because I doubt anyone cares if you quit.....<br />
<br />
And maybe before you start ranting you need to learn 2 read before you open your mouth, the appearance tab threads always stated real armor has to be put into the tabs, plate wearers have to wear plate of a certain level for example.<br />
<br />
And the effort of the art team went out the window a long time ago otherwise people wouldn't be so eager for an appearance tab. And since there are no dungeon sets anymore non raiders are forced to wear ugly non matching shit and a lot of people hate that.<br />

What he came up with was another excuse for you to /rant about your unreasonable expectations... it was a 2-for-1 special</div></div><hr />

<br />
The best thing Blizzard could do now is to change the naming of patch from 4.1 to, say, 4.0.9. That way it would NOT be major content patch, but still patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't change the fact tho that we are getting closer to 5 months into the content and next patch is not really a content patch... THey are simply not sending out content (even tho its less) MORE freqently. Its WAYYY to slow.<br />
<br />
The progression of the overall feel of WOW atm is so screwed. PPl should not have to do Heroic content in launch raids for 3-5 more months. And heroic dungeons are NOT NEW CONTENT compared to the normal one. Its the same crap with few things changed.<br />
<br />
THe progression should be that when MOST guilds that want to do normal raiding are done with it... then its time for new raiding content. The 5 man dungeons are NOT for those ppl. And thats why alot of guilds are loosing ppl every single day cause ppl are just gonna unsub for next 3-4 months till next raiding content comes out. Even my guild has done all normal bosses raiding 2-3 days per week and most dont log on anymore.. ANd we are ranked like 40 on our serve so IMAGINE how bored ppl are gonna be in 4 months from now.<br />
<br />
Its just horrible.<br />
<br />
ANd just to sum it up. This is the same guy that made the ZG video talking about 4.1<br />
http://www.youtube.com/user/OMFGcata#p/u/10/szhPFbTwBN0<br />
<br />
And here is another well known YouTuber saying pretty much the same (from 6:15)<br />
http://www.youtube.com/user/TotalHalibut#p/c/785DC64F790A5CA5/0/kx9kOybWkf8<br />
<br />
There is a very loud majority of ppl that have played ALOT of WOW that see through what BLizzard is doing.<br />
<br />
I have to agree with TB when he says &quot; They are not giving us what we were promised in patch 4.1&quot; THis is not just little disturbing to me. Its a point that need to be hammered into the mind of BLizzard that progression is very flawed in the game atm... and that keeping Firelands from ppl for 2-4 months simple can NOT be justified at this point.<br />
<br />
If ppl REALLY want to be called hardcore raiders they should be done with heroic content by now. If they are not... then BLizzard has overtuned it to the point where normal more casual raiders ARE suffering. Cause most of them dont care about Heroics... And if they are still stuck in Normal .. then its another very obvious sign that BLIzzard got it wrong. <br />
<br />
I think thats what we are seeing right now. Blizzard just got it wrong. Less and less ppl are loging in atm to even do normal raids. The rewards are not there if ppl havnt done it already. THey will NOT do it before patch 4.2 cause the guild will not have the number of players TO do it. Even the hardcore guilds on my server are loosing ppl every single day to unsub cause they really dont see the point of doing the heroics. And who can dissagre with them ?</div></div><hr />
