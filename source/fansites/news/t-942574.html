In portuguese we dont have composed names like, &quot;Storm/Wind&quot; or &quot;Wind/Runner&quot; as we dont have anything like &quot;Ranger&quot;, so i dont know what blizzard was thinking doing this, lol<br />
<br />
one thing to compare is Iceland which is (Gelo, portuguese of ice, and Terra/terreno, portuguese of land) acording to Blizzard Iceland should be translated as &quot;Geloterra&quot; or &quot;Terra de Gelo&quot;, but in reality its &quot;Islandia&quot; something that sounds like Iceland.

Re-read what he wrote - they do not have compound names. they do have a word for wind.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ginp</div><div class="date">2011-07-22, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But a person just stated there is no wind oh nvm<br />
<br />
We have &quot;Wind&quot; its &quot;Vento&quot;, but we dont have &quot;Windrunner&quot;. &quot;Run&quot; is translated into &quot;Corre&quot;. So there inst a word on our vocabulary named &quot;Correventos&quot;.<br />
<br />
But as the guy said i should have kept my mouth shut, sorry. ;P<br />
<br />
Stormwind was translated to Ventobravo, but Vento = Wind, and Bravo = Brave or Angry (depending when used). wtf</div></div><hr />

ALSO, according to that leaked release schedule thing, it looks like the next expansion of WoW would be next Q2, So, with that said, then they would release info on it at this years blizzcon if that were the case.</div></div><hr />

I don't think Blizz should translate names of cities, NPC's and factions (among a few others). Can you imagine the Frostwolf Clan being called [Clã do Lobo Congelado]? That is just plain wrong! :-( Ironforge becoming Fornalha de Ferro? OMG!!!!!!! I saw a Spanish version of the game, and they translated the names of weapons as well. I don't recall the exact weapon, but the literal translation was funny as hell! I just hope Blizz doesn't make the same &quot;mistake&quot; to the Brazilian version of this game...</div></div><hr />

He really does have a knack for these things.Upon looking at it again, I'm thinking that X4 means the announcement of the next expansion, not the release. So folks, don't be surprised if at Blizzcon this year they don't announce the next expansion, but keep it under wraps for six more months. I know that Blizzard had this dream to release an expac every year when they released the game, but so far it has worked out to be every two years. Fine, so long as they release enough content to keep most players happy (most players are not heroic raiders or folks with 20 hours to blow in a week on a single leisurely pursuit).It's also good because it means a lot of testing and amping up as stuff is trickled out. I think that the buildup to a new expansion is more exciting than the actual release!! Grabbing at every piece of confirmed news, finding out all the big, juicy things that are coming.

Stormwind became Angrywind. Outland became &quot;Landyond&quot;, as in some stupid combination of &quot;land&quot; and &quot;beyond&quot;, and Stormrage became...&quot;Storage&quot;(yes, they actually picked &quot;storm&quot; and &quot;rage&quot; and mashed the two words together, cutting out the end of &quot;storm&quot;)<br />
<br />
I seriously don't know what's wrong with Blizzard's brazillian translation team, but they suck pretty damn hard.<br />

The most important thing here is that we're getting a very good price for the subscription, R$ (BRL) 15,00 (or ~ US$ 9,65), with a multitude of methods of payment, and, if you choose to play in a Brazilian realm (you won't have to), there will be portuguese in-game support.

<br />
Those shouldn't be translated in the first place, but even if they did they should find someone who actualy knows brazillian portuguese, because those translations are simply ridiculous... you can't help laughing at those translations... as explained before, our language is close to french/spanish and way different from english.. many words simply can't be translated properly... I can't imagine what they'll do with the the accents and voices...<br />
<br />
Personaly I think I'll keep playing the english version of the game... I have no problem at all understanding everything in the game and changing anything other then maybe quest descriptions or big texts like that would totaly kill the experience. Just like tv series... whenever they try to translate it all characters have werids voices and many times they say things that make no sense! you should see the portuguese version of game of thrones they even translated the dothraki language! craped my pants when I saw it, thx god theres an english version too...<br />
<br />
As for the other services, game cards, WoW vanila, TBC and WotLK already sell in stores here but I'ts gona be much easier to pay for everything, and the prices are AWESOME so I'm happy for that...<br />
<br />
Now many US players will agree with me that many (not all) players from Warsong or Gurubashi (highest brazilian populated servers) are simply immature and irritating, and thats why I've always played with americans, theres trolls and ignorants everywhere but the amount of kids in those servers is crazy... so I'll probably stick to the US servers without brazilians even if I have to cope with 150-300ms latency (which never held me back at raid progression).<br />

In portuguese we dont have composed names like, &quot;Storm/Wind&quot; or &quot;Wind/Runner&quot; as we dont have anything like &quot;Ranger&quot;, so i dont know what blizzard was thinking doing this, lol<br />
<br />
one thing to compare is Iceland which is (Gelo, portuguese of ice, and Terra/terreno, portuguese of land) acording to Blizzard Iceland should be translated as &quot;Geloterra&quot; or &quot;Terra de Gelo&quot;, but in reality its &quot;Islandia&quot; something that sounds like Iceland.

They translated names too, but not from the very beginning. It happened some time after the release (one or two years after, I don't remember). So we went from french text + original names to french text + translated names even if a lot of people disagreed with that (as it is always the case BTW, :cool:).<br />
Few examples : <br />
Ironforge &gt; Forgefer (which is the literal translation)<br />
Stormwind &gt; Hurlevent (approximately : to scream + wind).<br />
Thunderbluff &gt; Pitons-du-tonnerre (approximately : pitons (for alpinism) + thunder)<br />
<br />
Some people liked it , others didn't (and still don't).<br />
The french localization team is composed of smart guys (and girls) but they are not totally free, it's the US team who decided to make all the names translated all around the world.<br />
<br />

Who said anything about there being 3 more major content patches?<br />
<br />
If blizzard intends to only do 3 tiers this expansion then they only need 1 more major content patch to do it. Abyssal maw is scrapped so that leaves just COT and Deathwing. They could easily put them in the same tier.<br />
<br />
Even if they make more 5 man heroics that won't take up 6 months... 4.1 was essentially part of 4.2 but released earlier. 4.3 and 4.4 would be the same, there's no way they'd take up 1 year.</div></div><hr />

-quoted from the official pt site<br />
&quot;Aonde os servidores estarão localizados? A latência ficará menor?<br />
<br />
A nossa equipe de operações está trabalhando com os principais provedores de serviços de internet para garantir que os jogadores tenham a melhor experiência de jogo possível.&quot;<br />
(Where will the servers be localized? Is the latency gonna be lower?<br />
<br />
Our operations team is working with the main ISP to assure our players have the best game experience possible)<br />
<br />
Since Feb of this year that I heard they oppened an official Blizzard branch in Sao Paulo to both launch and translate games to portuguese as soon as they are launched internationally, I was quite sure they would also open game servers in there (if they are doing all that, opening servers here would be easy as pie. not to mention convenient to everybody living in south america)<br />
<br />
Btw, I have to disagree to whoever said the brazillian popupation in Gurubashi and Warsong is imature. Its rather the OPPOSITE! most BR players are much more educated than the regular US player.<br />
This will probably change drastically as soon as they open BR realms and start advertising it in here, cause I gotta be honest, if you ever played in a free BR server of any game at all (even payed games) you know how pretty much most of BR players are kids and/or delinquents.<br />
Currently that isn't the case in Gurubashi and Warsong cause the only people that have knowledge of the game and want to pay ~25 USD every month using an international credit card are mostly mature people (pretty much everybody i know is over their 20's).</div></div><hr />

That's exactly what happened to the german version after one year or so (including many players installing the English language pack). They started translating basically all place names and characters into a German equivalent (while translating everything quite literally).I never understood why they would do that. I mean no translator in their right mind would translate places or names from a novel. But from what I read in these comments it seems to be some kind of weird directive from blizzard that tells the translation teams to translate the places and names as literal as possible. Very wierd.</div></div><hr />

That means not only will it be announced at Blizzcon, but it have to be fairly advanced in developement.....<br />
<br />
Indeed, and not only that: In fact, public beta would have to start around Blizzcon for a Q2 realease to be possible. In addition, the Deathwing raid would also have to be released right after Blizzcon or it would not be given enough time for people to raid him before we move on to the Maelstrom/SouthSeas xpac. <br />
<br />
Q2 release would mean an April or May release because they can't release it in June. 6 months of public beta has been a fixture that is unlikely to change. So, early November for public beta.<br />
<br />
While I'd love to see a Q2 release and while I have a lot of respect for Bibi's predictions before, the way he seems to be implying that he is convinced the leaked product slate is real is peculiar because this also implies that he thinks a Q2-2012 Expansion is probable or at least possible. But tbh it just seems weird given the complete silence from Blizzard on anything realted to future patches, let alone expansions. To think that the public beta will start right after Blizzcon for an expansion that is not even announced, and that we will raiding Deathwing, at the very least on the PTR, during Blizzcon seems unlikely. <br />
<br />
We currently do not know ANYTHING about upcoming patches except that we will fight Deathwing at some future point. That's pretty much all we know. War of the Ancients raid is just a theory based on Blizz saying that a CoT raid was planned for Cataclysm at a past Blizzcon, but they also said a lot of other things that were scrapped and withdrawn from (like Abyssal Maw dungeon in 4.1/4.2). If indeed there is to be a Q2 release, Blizzard would have to have scrpapped pretty much everything else planned for the current xpac, except a final Deathwing raid (and perhaps some 5-mans and quest content related to DW).<br />
<br />
I don't think it's ever before been as unclear as it now is where WoW is heading patchwise. We basically knows nothing and the odd fragments of indications that have shown up (such as the leaked product slate) make no sense logically.</div></div><hr />

Translating persons and places names is so wrong. In some cases the outcome has nothing to do with the original intent. Good translations do the original version justice, and if not possible don't translate at all. Example: Winterspring/Winterfall. Notice the somewhat subtle play on seasons. In german they are called Winterquell (spring translated to quelle, which is meant as water source) and Winterfelle (fall scrapped, translated to Felle, which means pelt, fur). The play is gone, left are generic names. At one point they even considered to translate Thrall to Sklave. Sure, thrall means also slave, and may sound good if you're not a native german speaker. But I can assure you, it sounds utterly dumb, to the point that even the hobby translators at Blizz got it. I can't even imagine how some of the brazilian translations must sound to you guys, I don't speak a word of it so no clue. They should stop this nonsense, reverse every translation of such things at once and give the name of the person who came up with such a stupid idea, to be mocked into eternity.<br />
<br />
But hey, I should thank them in some way. The stupidity of their translation got me into getting better at english, to a point that it's like a second first language to me today :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
While we're speaking about translations and stuff, wouldn't it be really funny if they made it so all the characters in WoW had an Australian accent? I think that would have been golden.<br />
(At least the characters without a previous accent.)<br />
<br />
On the Brazilian Portugese-thing, I actually don't think it sounds that bad. Then again, I don't know the language well, so it might just be the reason why.<br />
<br />
I'm actually interested in seeing the translations in Japanese too. Although it'll probably just be a bunch of kanji (the letters they use) which a lot of people, me included, can't understand.<br />
<br />
Languages are a funny thing. Wonder how it would go if WoW was translated to Norwegian... I kinda get the pain, when I think about that, actually.</div></div><hr />

-quoted from the official pt site<br />
&quot;Aonde os servidores estarão localizados? A latência ficará menor?<br />
<br />
A nossa equipe de operações está trabalhando com os principais provedores de serviços de internet para garantir que os jogadores tenham a melhor experiência de jogo possível.&quot;<br />
(Where will the servers be localized? Is the latency gonna be lower?<br />
<br />
Our operations team is working with the main ISP to assure our players have the best game experience possible)<br />
<br />
Since Feb of this year that I heard they oppened an official Blizzard branch in Sao Paulo to both launch and translate games to portuguese as soon as they are launched internationally, I was quite sure they would also open game servers in there (if they are doing all that, opening servers here would be easy as pie. not to mention convenient to everybody living in south america)<br />
<br />
Btw, I have to disagree to whoever said the brazillian popupation in Gurubashi and Warsong is imature. Its rather the OPPOSITE! most BR players are much more educated than the regular US player.<br />
This will probably change drastically as soon as they open BR realms and start advertising it in here, cause I gotta be honest, if you ever played in a free BR server of any game at all (even payed games) you know how pretty much most of BR players are kids and/or delinquents.<br />
Currently that isn't the case in Gurubashi and Warsong cause the only people that have knowledge of the game and want to pay ~25 USD every month using an international credit card are mostly mature people (pretty much everybody i know is over their 20's).<br />
<br />
I will have to disagree with the &quot;mature&quot; part on servers like gurubashi and warsong lol =p, I have friends playing on gurubashi and I didnt like the server... cant say anything about warsong but its probably just like gurubashi. But yea, I agree that these new servers will be full of kids and... anyway I already played free games full of brazilians and its just sad....</div></div><hr />

FYI the german World of Warcraft is also translated that way. &quot;Höllschrei&quot; instead of &quot;Hellscream&quot; and &quot;Eisenschmiede&quot; instead of &quot;Ironforge&quot; and so on. Some sound really cheesy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every language pack is translated that way, its a damn shame.<br />
This actually wasn't the case until patch 1.12 before that only quest texts and items were translated the rest was left alone(and simple npc such as rabbits boars etc).<br />
That was perfectly fine, bot NOOO<br />
<br />
In 1.12 they had to translate every single spell, talent, NPC, Area city etc.<br />
There where 100pages+ protest threads for years but they never changed it back.<br />
<br />
Today the community on the German servers are pretty much split up between people playing in German and English.<br />
Sometimes we don't even understand which skill or area the other one means^^.<br />
And don't even get me started about the mix of English and German item links in the trade chat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, AFAIK, German does use such compound names every day, unlike (Brazilian) Portuguese. Still, Hollschrei might sound funny. They didn't translate things like &quot;Hellscream&quot; or &quot;Windrunner&quot; in Polish WC3, so I was spared this fate last time Blizzard game was translated into Polish. (Oddly enough, they did translate &quot;Bronzebeard&quot; as &quot;Miedziobrody&quot;, but that was an exception)</div></div><hr />

Names shouldn't be trasnlated. <br />
<br />
Then, it also bothers me that they consider Brazilian Portuguese a language when in reality, it isn't a language, its a derivation of Portuguese. Its the same story as American English and British English, only one is a language and it surely isn't the American one. <br />
<br />
There are more Portuguese speakers in the world than Brazilian Portuguese so again, I fail to comply why they did this. In any case, I'd much rather play the game in English than in any other language, even if it was my own. <br />
<br />
WoW also helped and allowed me to develop my English and to be honest, paying for a game in Brazil isn't something that many can afford, not because it is expensive but because it is not a priority. So, I would assume that everyone playing WoW would understand enough English (due to their &quot;social status&quot;) to play this game without any problems. <br />
<br />
After all, if they say you must know English for everything, I don't know why gaming would be an exception.</div></div><hr />

By that point, these estimates will have been over 3 years old (since when this product slate was made) but even if they did get it spot on, 2 things happening within a 3 month window would be a pretty liberal use of &quot;exactly the same time&quot;. Regardless, they're releasing HotS and D3 within a similar timeframe, so it's not that unlikely.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ever since Cata I'd hope WoW 2 would be announced with better graphics and reset of levels. The xpac after xpac gets a bit exhaustive.<br />
The expansion packs (which have all improved the graphics and reset the playing field) are exhaustive, so they should release WoW 2 to alleviate the problem, with the key features being graphical improvements and a level reset? If that's what you want from WoW 2, it seems you could upgrade your video card and then make a new character.</div></div><hr />

Some examples : Thunderbluff : Pitons du tonnerre (which can have a very sexual double-meaning by the way) Undercity : Fossoyeuse Ironforge : Forgefer The translations are just literal translations. At least, they did not translate World of Warcraft to &quot;Monde des faiseurs de guerre&quot;... What is a nightmare though is that the iPhone mobile armory enforces using the language of the iPhone (which is in french for me), so I can't understand anything that is written there when I look at my gear or such.

Interesting. What is the &quot;right&quot; way to translate cases like this? Just leave the English intact? I develop software and have hired translation services in the past to localize applications, but I've always trusted them to just know what they're doing if given enough context. I rarely if ever have seen them just leave English words in place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as a general rule, all names should be left untouched. I am not entirely sure if class names would fall in this category, but If were to translate WoW, I would leave Warlock, Rogue and Priest alone, since we don't have words for those classes, and I sure as hell wouldn't put something like &quot;Ventobravo&quot; in the game...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It depends on the translator and on the client really. You could do a &quot;meaning by meaning&quot; translation or a &quot;word by word&quot; translation. I prefer a meaning translation, though the words and sentences may seem completly changed, the reader will feel more familiar with the text and the writers intention will be preserved more than if you translated word by word.<br />
<br />
Names are usually kept the same, they're changed sometimes when they mean something that will become important to the story later. <br />
Sometimes they're changed to become more similar to the names in the country. Like the name of Harry Potter's father was changed from James to Thiago in Brasil.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4.3 - Rise of the Plants: We didn't see a reason to hold up all this great new content for some silly raid to get finished, so now enjoy playing Heroic Maraudon! It will drop loot that puts Firelands Heroic gear to shame, but will be easily replaced in 1 month by the next raid gear. LFD groups are tough to get tanks for, so now if a tank solo-queue's in LFD he will be automatically immune to all damage to make his run smoother (and a bonus 200 VP per run!). If the DPS and healer can keep up, they'll get credit for kills too! <br />
<br />
4.4 - Think Green and Recycle: There's a new plant BH boss, and that's about it. To pass off BH as a new raid, we're going to buff the existing bosses and have all of them drop the new tier of gear. Players dislike RNG, so we're trying out a new loot system, where each boss is just going to give each player an &quot;Uber Token&quot;, which can be traded in for a piece of their choice in the new tier. Shaman DPS are still showing up in some raids so we're dropping their damage another 50%.<br />
<br />
4.5 - Death of Death: Finally, you get to fight Deathwing! We didn't see a need to make you fight a bunch of new raid bosses to gear up for him, so instead we've just instanced that tiny island next to the maelstrom where you'll fight alongside Thrall to kill Deathwing as he flies over the swirl! Boy, some people were worried that redoing a small part of a solo-quest as the last tier of raiding would seem half-assed, but did it ever cut down on development time! You don't need to tank the boss, tanks can now get raid gear just for downing heroic bosses, so they should just go queue in LFD already. Melee DPS will have to wait for Deathwing to occasionally fly near the island to get in a few hits.</div></div><hr />

lol... did you even read till the end?<br />
to make things clear: there WILL be brazillian oriented realms with online portuguese support from GMs and a brazillian community site and there will be a datacenter hosted in Brazil (probably Sao Paulo) and my personal guess is it will also serve as the latin america hub for south america realms<br />
the translated game client is OPTIONAL. Its the same as choosing the displayed language in youtube: you can still watch any video you want, it just changes the displayed language to you. you could play in BR servers with a german game client if you wanted to.</div></div><hr />

Seeing as the 4th expansion will have a 2 years time span compared to the almost 1.5 year between Cataclysm and the 4th expansion, it looks possible to me to have only 3 tiers in Cataclysm like it happend before and to have 4 tiers again in the 4th expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then, it also bothers me that they consider Brazilian Portuguese a language when in reality, it isn't a language, its a derivation of Portuguese. Its the same story as American English and British English, only one is a language and it surely isn't the American one. <br />
<br />
There are more Portuguese speakers in the world than Brazilian Portuguese so again, I fail to comply why they did this. In any case, I'd much rather play the game in English than in any other language, even if it was my own.That's some serious ignorance about language right there, I didn't bother reading the next 3 pages so forgive me if someone replied to this already.<br />
<br />
Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese are both languages. They are both also dialects of Portuguese. There is no such thing as a Universal Portuguese (or English) that everyone speaks that then gets filtered down into dialects, that's not how things work. Standard American English for example is a dialect no one really speaks it's just a linguistic/didactic tool to make communication easier.<br />
<br />
Everyone, everywhere in the world speaks some dialect of a language - even if their dialect is the most widely used one. Brazilian Portuguese is the standard for Portuguese now largely due to the size of the population and economy of Brazil.</div></div><hr />

it doesnt matter what realm you play in. as long as you live in brazil the subscription will be R$ 15.00<br />
there will be a time frame when character transfers to BR realms will be free of cost, so anyone willing to play with low latencies will have a few weeks before deciding to finally transfer free of charge.</div></div><hr />

I'd definitely would call an Expansion 4 announcement a sure thing for BlizzCon '11.

Agreed.<br />
&quot;Garrosh Grito Infernal&quot; is accurate. Hellscream is not a surname, it's a given name. <br />
But &quot;Sylvanna Ventocorrido&quot; is going too far. That's her surname, no need to translate it. I can already see Muradin and his brothers ending up being &quot;Barba de Bronze&quot;.<br />
<br />

<br />
Luckily for me I'll be stayng in my current Realm, playing in english, so... No biggie.When I grew up in Brazil (I've been in the US since college now) dubbing was exceptional - at least if you had high production values like globo. I remember when I first heard MacGyver in English it was a huge disconnect; you simply could not convince me that his voice in English was the real actor's voice, that's how good the dubbing in Portuguese was, coupled with how used to hearing him in Portuguese I was.<br />
<br />
Of course if you were watching on a smaller network or even SBT that's a different story, a lot of dubbing on Globo was a step above anywhere else.<br />
<br />

<br />
Based on your deep analysis of a few screenshots. That's like writing literary criticism about book covers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed.<br />
&quot;Garrosh Grito Infernal&quot; is accurate. Hellscream is not a surname, it's a given name. <br />
But &quot;Sylvanna Ventocorrido&quot; is going too far. That's her surname, no need to translate it. I can already see Muradin and his brothers ending up being &quot;Barba de Bronze&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, by your logic we should call the country &quot;Deutschland&quot; instead of &quot;Alemanha&quot; since we shouldn't translate names.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But what I fear the most is the audio, dubbing in Brazil is one of the worst ever.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here I must agree. The problem is that dubbing is always done with a ridiculous &quot;paulista&quot; accent, and when it's not paulista it's carioca, which is even uglier. That's hardly Blizzard's fault however.</div></div><hr />

It's a translation, it is supposed to translate things that have meaning in english to something with a similar meaning in portuguese, while at the same time trying to respect the form of the original language. The objective is to allow those who have no knowledge of english (remember, children play these games as well) to understand the entire world and its lore.<br />
<br />
I bet newcomers to the game will find names like Garrosh Grito Infernal and Penhasco do Trovão very cool. And if you don't, just keep playing the english client, the Pt-BR language pack is optional.<br />

I agree. But the Blizzard guy said, to reflect the english version, they took into account accents for each of the races as well, so we'll have to wait and see if anything was really done. I for one am hoping to see a Bahian accent on da trolls.</div></div><hr />

Of course if you were watching on a smaller network or even SBT that's a different story, a lot of dubbing on Globo was a step above anywhere else.<br />

It may seem stranger for people used to play on English version, but yes, it should be translated. Besides, &quot;Hellscream&quot; means exactly &quot;Grito Infernal&quot;, it may seem prettier for non-English native speakers since its different, but for the natives, it's exactly &quot;Grito Infernal&quot;!And think about the ones who don't speak English, for instance, the quest tell they to go to &quot;Swamp of Sorrows&quot;, it would just mean a random set of meaningless words, while if the quest tell these people to go in to the &quot;Pantano da Tristeza&quot; (or whatever i would be called) it will represent the essence of the place.As for the dubbing, Blizzard did a great job with Starcraft 2 imo, and the probably will do the same with World of Warcraft, and even more, if you prefer to play on English, just select the language on the game client, but essentially, non-English speakers would be able to play, and understand the game lore, what I think its awesome.</div></div><hr />

I was shocked by the attention to detail in Starcraft II. Even tiny textures in the scenery were translated, that was a top-notch effort. People may whine all they want about the translated units but ultimately it's just that: whining. And they even released SC2 under a entirely different business model to make the game more accessible, they hire local community moderators and all that. It may take a while (in WoW's case) but when they do something, they get it freaking right.<br />

Let's hope they get those accents right. Yes, trolls speaking in Bahian would be so perfect that I would give all my earthly belongings to Blizzard if they did that and race-change all my toons.

You obviously don't know portuguese very well, the letter w is in the portuguese alphabet (k and y as well). And before it was included, the letter was still supposed to be used in words of foreign origin. Worgen and Wrynn are fictional words, you won't find them in an english dictionary, nor is there a portuguese equivalent for them, that is why they weren't translated.</div></div><hr />

The example you said &quot;meu&quot; isnt an accent, accent is more about pronunciation!Meu is a very typical marker of a Paulista accent (it's also not a pronunciation issue).<br />
<br />
EVERY part of how you speak makes up your individual accent which is part of a larger regional or cultural or social dialect.<br />
<br />
When people say they don't have an accent what they're really saying is &quot;I don't sound different to everyone around me&quot;. So it's a question of the colloquial usage of accent versus the more technical use of the word.<br />
<br />
Like I said you have an accent, the only way not to have one, technically, would be to not have a language.<br />
<br />
Anyways, it's me being a little pedantic about people taking linguistic expressions for granted - you can say you don't have an accent all you want, as long as you understand what that means. As far as linguists are concerned, you, just like everyone else, have one.</div></div><hr />

Exactly: you people say &quot;mêêêêo&quot; in a very &quot;paulista&quot; way. Where I live we don't say &quot;meu&quot; as a vocative but when we do (&quot;meu carro&quot;), it's very short (&quot;meu&quot;).<br />
<br />
<br />
Trust me, paulistas have a very thick accent that sounds ugly. You live in São Paulo so you can't notice it, it's fine. I can't for the life of me notice any accent in my own city but I know we have because people other people talk about our accents (the typical case being &quot;leiTE quenTE&quot; instead of &quot;leitch quenchi&quot; like in the rest of the country - it sounds to us like everybody _else_ has an accent...).</div></div><hr />

one thing to compare is Iceland which is (Gelo, portuguese of ice, and Terra/terreno, portuguese of land) acording to Blizzard Iceland should be translated as &quot;Geloterra&quot; or &quot;Terra de Gelo&quot;, but in reality its &quot;Islandia&quot; something that sounds like Iceland.

The worst thing about it all is that it clearly shows that Brazilians do not admire their own language...<br />

The reason for all this disappointment is not about how it sounds or how it should be named. It's just because Brazilians have been raised in a country where people don't give a shit about their own culture.<br />

Until you live in vacuum and never consult any site to have information, it's fine.<br />
But as soon as you need to look something on wowhead or wowwiki, you realize that you need to translate &quot;Ventobravo&quot; in English to find any kind of useful information, and you translation could not be perfect.<br />
Example (disclaimer: I don't speak Portuguese so I assume that &quot;Curse of Agony&quot; is translated into &quot;Maldição do Agonia&quot;): How do you translate it back into English to look on Wowwiki what it does? &quot;Malediction of Throe&quot;? &quot;Damn of Death Struggle&quot;? Or the correct &quot;Curse of Agony&quot; immediately?<br />
<br />
I live in a non English speaking EU country, and since I started playing PnP RPG in early 80s, I never bought handbooks translated in my language, as it makes too hard to obtain any kind of useful information from English sources (Dragon and Dungeon magazines for D&amp;D for example).</div></div><hr />

The problem you are alluding to is more about:<br />
<br />
1. the limits of machine translation<br />
2. the limited understanding of linguistics and translation among laypersons (why do people think direct translations are good ideas???)<br />
and <br />
3. the volume of information on wow available in a given language and how easily it can be found.<br />
<br />
1 and 2 aren't changing overnight but 3 is one area where Brazilian Portuguese is relatively strong. Who knows, maybe wowhead will have Portuguese available from its dropdown language menu once WoW is released in Portuguese. That would be pretty cool.<br />
<br />

Is Garrosh Hellscream a real historic figure?<br />
<br />
He is as real as Daffy Duck (Patolino), Uncle Scrooge (Tio Patinhas), or Goofy (Pateta), Rogue from X-Men (Vampira), Storm (Tempestade), Strider from Lord of the Rings (Passolargo), or even Middle Earth (Terra Media) and Shire (Condado). All very popular cases where names of characters and places were translated,, some completely different from the original meaning.</div></div><hr />

You clearly didn't read my entire post.<br />
I'll post again...<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a fantasy game hence I believe almost everything can be translated / adapted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Real names of real people can't be translated. This is fantasy game that was created not based on real history and it was not tied to a specific language.</div></div><hr />

I did read, but I can see that I misunderstood the point you were trying to make in the previus quoted post. <br />
Oh, well.<br />

Edit PS: Greymane is still Greymane when that name has already been translated in all the other versions.</div></div><hr />
