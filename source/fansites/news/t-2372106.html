Literally what is says... e.g. 1000 Stamina, 1.8% of that is 18. Take flat 18 damage less.</div></div><hr />

As it says? What do you mean? Its a passive damage reduction like all the others?!<br />
<br />
Depending on what Zandalari gets as a racial i will make my druid to one of those. WAY better for pvp than both troll or tauren.<br />

My affliction lock is for sure getting changed to void elf since it will be getting some of the most overpowered racials ever. <br />

<br />
This seems incredibly broken against dot classes/encounters.<br />
<br />
If im not mistaken, if the dots of a warlock do 4% each tick of your total health this will eat 1.8% away so they only do 2.2% (40% reduction) damage.<br />
<br />
Or do i miss something here?<br />
<br />

<br />
you are mistaken, it just means each tick will have its damaged reduced by whatever 1.8% of the targets stamina is, example if a target has 5000 stamina the damage reduction would be 90 damage.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but it is way stronger against dots and fast hitting classes or encounters.<br />
<br />
an arms warrior laughs about the 2k reduction while he crits you for 2+ million.<br />

an affliction warlock or spriest suffer way more.<br />

(btw the guilds i was in were not the best but not bad either). These people are just inventing reasons to qq.</div></div><hr />

I agree on the tanking and healing specs; I'm totally lost on those. WindWalker is fun, though. It used to be easier until their Mastery became &quot;don't press the same button twice in a row&quot; and that makes WW overly complex to process; if that was gone, WW would be better. And I do wish Fistweaving didn't go away from healing spec.</div></div><hr />

No.<br />
<br />
Idk if you have tried monk in Legion but this is just wrong, monk isn't even that hard to play.<br />
<br />
build chi up with tiger palm and spent it on 1 of the 3-4 chi spenders you got to hold them off cd is basically how you play the monk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Use Rising Sun Kick<br />
Use Fists of Fury<br />
Use Strike of the Windlord<br />
Use Whirling Dragon Punch<br />
<br />
If you have less than 4 Chi AND you are about to reach maximum Energy.<br />
Use Blackout Kick Icon Blackout Kick.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that Tiger Palm has a chance to cause the next Blackout Kick Icon Blackout Kick not to cost any Chi.<br />
Use Tiger Palm<br />
<br />
This is the single target priority-list from icy veins only missing your cd storm earth and fire, thats not much.<br />
Same for brew and mistweaver, it is pretty clear when you have to hit ability x.<br />
<br />
The reason why monk is not that popular is simply how weak they startet out in their introduction in terms of hype, the youtuber preach has a pretty good video on the legacy of the monk imo. Deathknights and DH started of &quot;cooler&quot; as &quot;hero-class&quot;.<br />

I'd loved to have seen a slightly more interesting racial split as well. Giving the same faction a visually tweaked variant to your present models feels kind of unexciting. If, say, the alliance had got Highmountain tauren? or the horde lightforged draenai? Now that would have been exciting.<br />

And yet, as the story seems to be shaping up, Alliance gets two 'races' that are directly linked to the conflicts ahead (Lightforged Draenei representing the Light and Void Elves representing the Void) - while the Horde gets 'races' whose stories are pretty much over and told, with little to no obvious connection to future storylines.</div></div><hr />

Everyone is thinking that they may let us roll Allied Race characters before BFA actually drops; especially as a pre-order bonus. People are thinking that announcement may be as early as tomorrow, because they're having a QnA tomorrow with Ion Hazzikostas, and usually those only happen on thursday.

<br />
I never said anything about the racials - I'm aware the void elves have better things. I said the alliance were being shafted by being behind a NEWER content rep, especially when people have started to come back due to the expansion being closer to release. The horde two announced detailed info (HMT and Nightborne), have HAD their reps in the game since the beginning of legion. That essentially means the people who have played horde at the start of legion do NOT have to play catch up with a rep. Meanwhile, Alliance whom have stopped playing and are coming back have to go through this bull rep grind for a feature that comes with the new expansion.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that the Zandalari trolls unlock rep is old news, just as dark iron dwarves are. So with saying that, alliance get one allied race they don't have to grind the NEWEST rep; Horde get three allied races they don't have to grind the newest rep for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I keep seeing people say &quot;Well, this is much worse against DOT classes&quot;. <br />
<br />
It is 1.8% of your Stamina, not your max health. <br />
<br />
That means, currently, a really well geared Tank is dropping, what? 2000 damage off a DoT tick of like 400,000 damage. That is less than 1% reduction. <br />
<br />
This minuscule amount of damage will only be made more insignificant after the ilvl/stat squish. <br />
<br />
When we go from having 100k Stamina as a tank to having 6k Stamina, that damage reduction is dwarfed even more into potentially double digits worth of damage off attacks in the thousands. <br />
<br />
Now, the Versatility boost is a pretty solid and nice racial as it will actually scale properly. The 1.8% Stam reduction is hardly anything and hardly worth even noting.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what you're expecting at this point. Allied races are variants of existing races with new customization options and racial abilities, etc.<br />

And I don't blame Blizzard for that - for years,Horde players have yearned to get night elves on their side and the Alliance always had that nostalgic vibe from Warcraft 3 about the high elves...Blizzard gives the nightborne to the Horde and the void elves to the Alliance - problem solved. I personally think,that the lightforged draenei and the Highmountain tauren aren't that unique and special and differ only slightly from the original races,yet by reading the posts,I presume,that they will be more popular than the &quot;original&quot; races.</div></div><hr />

You do realise that stamina and Max HP is connected, right? and when the ilvl/stat squish happen the dmg of abilities also go down so that 400k dot dmg is not gonna be 400k after the squish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do realize that, while related, Stamina is a much lower number than Max Health, right? So when you have a reduction based on one value reducing damage based on a different value and the value the reduction is based on is much smaller, that the actual % reduction is smaller?<br />
<br />
If you get about 60 health per Stamina, that means for every 3000 health, you have approximately 50 Stamina, which means a DoT will tick for about 120 damage and you will get a reduction of 1 damage. Not exactly anything to write home about. The point is, yes, they are linked, but when the value damage taken is based off of is 60x higher than the value reduction is based off of, the reduction is effectively meaningless. <br />
<br />
So, yes, after the squish, the 400k dot damage won't be 400k. But because damage is and not done in fractional values, that means that you won't even see a full whole single digit of reduction until you have 56 Stamina. Which means, after the first 28 Stamina, you need 56 more to see any change to the reduction. Because gear will have a lot less actual stats, there will be a lot less Stamina to build up decent reduction, as there will be much higher likelihood of truncation of reduction. Because the damage itself is based off health which will get multiplied by a factor of about 60, the pool grows much faster and thus, DoT tick damage grows much faster which means DoT damage is increased by 2.4 for every 1 Stamina. Which means that DoT damage is growing at a rate 134.4x faster than reduction is growing. Again, nothing to write home about.<br />
<br />
But, to be honest, this is a good thing because, as a number of posters have shown, the initial impression seems like it could be a huge survival gain for tanks, which would be the impetus for a lot of tanks in progression guilds potentially feeling the need to either shift Horde or at least race change to Highmountain. But given that the reduction is actually somewhat negligible, that means people aren't FORCED into it just for the sake of progression, because the reduction is rather minor, to the point that, aside from some wildly random chance occurrence, it won't be what saves a tank from dying, nor will it have make any appreciable difference to healing requirements. This is the kind of effect a racial SHOULD have, something negligible that gives a little flavor but doesn't truly effect anything balance wise that makes people feel forced into a certain race for whatever content they want to do. Similar to Alliance PvPers feeling the need to go Human when EMFH was so OP, or Horde going Undead for WotF.</div></div><hr />
