Affenjungs INC vs. Halion 25 Heroic 
Affenjungs Inc released a video of one of their attempts against Halion in 25-Man Heroic mode on PTRs. The normal mode of the encounter was already fairly impressive but it really looks like the Heroic mode will hurt.

Affenjungs Inc (http://www.apeboys.org) released a video of one of their attempts against Halion in 25-Man Heroic mode on PTRs. The normal mode of the encounter was already fairly impressive but it really looks like the Heroic mode will hurt. <br />

Zalazane's Fall and Operation Gnomeregan Videos<br />
The first part of the Cataclysm Prologue (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/cataclysm-prologue-gnomeregan-and-the-echo-isles/) is on PTRs and people who are much more useful than me released videos of both events on Youtube. Of course, you might want to avoid them if you don't like spoilers. <br />
<br />
The videos are Youtube playlists, just click on the next video for the 2nd part, etc ...<br />

The MMO Report<br />
This is probably the last time you will see the MMO Report (http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/tag/3321/The-MMO-Report.html) on MMO-Champion since they decided to make fun of me. I'll be waiting for a virtual hug from Casey in my mail to resume posting. <br />
<br />
Also, small update on the &quot;we got hacked (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/oh-god-mmo-champion-got-hacked/)&quot; issue. After checking a few things it seems that it only affected something like 5% of the readers on the site, assuming that at least half of them had an up to date antivirus, I probably did a front page news just because 2.5% of my users got a spyware. And no, the virus didn't target WoW accounts, we just have 1M visits each day on the site and some people get randomly hacked for tons of reasons, when MMO-Champion becomes that reason you won't need me to hear about it everywhere on the forums. <br />
<br />
I still apologize for the screwup, even if it's not as bad as it looked in the first place. <br />

Yeah, sounds like both sides will have a lot of fun with this event. Does anyone know if you get any vanity rewards or the like, or if you can do it multiple times on the same toon or does it phase you out once the event is completed?</div></div><hr />

You gain a lot more than before, at least. They have a foothold.<br />
<br />
Which is more than enough for a starting zone for Gnomes, while still keeping the Gnomeregan dungeon viable. Heck, this new interest in the area may revitalize the Gnomeregan 5-man. Make it less confusing...or at least, less of a lengthy dungeon.</div></div><hr />

You couldn't tell that what Boub said was sarcastic. I'm not pointing out your 'flaws' and don't say that you don't follow every waking move of it because you clearly read what Boub said, you just didn't understand it, clearly. Don't take it out on me because you realised you were wrong and people noticed. I notice as well that you only picked on me, no one else who pointed out your confusion. Maybe you did this because I'm female, and says so in my personal text, and you thought, &quot;Ah, a girl, I can pick on her.&quot; Seems all rather sexist. And not every girl who uses the internet to have a good time is fat. Unless you believe in those stereotypes, of course.<br />
<br />
Very nice defense stance there. Keep it up hehe.<br />
<br />
Those events look way cool, might come back before cata after all.</div></div><hr />

Regardless get over it, everyone gets mocked in cyberspace and you are not above the fray. Deal with it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How good does it make you feel to point out flaws in people who don't follow the every waking move and word of the person who runs a video game blog? My guess is is makes a fat &quot;chick&quot; feel real good. Good to know the fat bitch felt good for a minute. <br />
<br />
<br />
When you write a post like you did, then respond to it like this, I have a hard time not expressing myself to you without insulting your intelligence.<br />
<br />
Or you might just be another troll to the fold. Either way, you're of a questionable intellectual capacity.<br />
<br />
<br />

On another note, I enjoyed all the videos. Even MMO-report was slightly informative for a change.<br />
The Gnomeregan music is the best! But it's a pity the gnomes don't get more.</div></div><hr />

The virus that infected us only scans your computer for FTP login info or so, in order to spread itself further. The last thing it wants is getting detected, so if you saw porn/viagra/whatever ad spam, it wasn't from this one.</div></div><hr />

Dialogue,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u03Iwq7qIgs<br />
<br />
Prologue:<br />
Vol'jin: Sons and daughters of da Darkspear. Friends of da tribe. We be gatherin' here on the shores of Sen'jin Village to be takin' back what is ours. Come now, join the liberation of the Echo Isles. Zalazane will fall.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: We be gettin' ready to march on the isles and free them of Zalazane's wicked rule. Join me.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: Zalazane's time has come. Da Darkspear will have a proper home again. Be ready.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: You came, wise sista. Da Darkspear be grateful.<br />
<br />
Zentabra: Of course, son of Sen'jin. Zentabra always keep her word.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: Dey time has come. Warriors of the Darkspear make ready. The Loa walk with us. Are ya ready, Vanira. Zentabra.<br />
<br />
Vanira: The elements... yes... dey be walkin' with us, too!<br />
<br />
Zentabra: As do da beasts of dese isles.<br />
<br />
Searching out Bwonsamdi:<br />
Vol'jin: Den we go... first to Bwonsamdi. If we gonna win dis, we need his mojo on our side.<br />
Bwonsamdi: Who be stirrin' up me bones! Dems Bwonsamdi's charges and not to be touched!<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: I be Vol'jin, son of Sen'jin, here to ask your aid, Great Bwonsamdi.<br />
<br />
Bwonsamdi: Hmph. I know who ya are, Shadowhunter, and I know what ya want. But what makes ya think I'm gonna help you. Ain't a wise ding callin' me from da utta side.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: I ain't askin' for me alone, Great Spirit. But on behalf of da Darkspear Tribe. On behalf of me people.<br />
<br />
Bwonsamdi: Darkspear... It been long time since I heard the drums... since I drank da ritual offerings... I be watchin' over yer dead, Vol'jin, and for nothing. Why have the Darkspear forsaken Bwonsamdi.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: We were driven away, Great Spirit. Hex master Zalazane took the isles from us, drove us mad, made us fight one another. Da only trolls left in da Echo isles are his mindless voodoo slaves.<br />
<br />
Bwonsamdi: Zalazane...<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: Aid us, Bwonsamdi. Help us regain our home. Return da Darkspear to da Echo Isles and hear your drums again. Drink your ritual offerings once more. Dis I, as son of Sen'jin, do swear.<br />
<br />
Bwonsamdi: Mmm... Time ta see how bad you want dis, Shadowhunter. Time ta see if you be worthy. <br />
<br />
Bwonsamdi: Ya tink ya have what it takes ta face me? Give up, Shadowhunter.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: Not me, Great Spirit. Ma tribe.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: Dey be waitin' for us all. We fight now for our old home. We gonna claim what be ours.<br />
<br />
Bwonsamdi: Enough! *chuckles ominously* Ya got some big mojo, Vol'jin. Maybe ye be worth helpin' after all.<br />
<br />
Bwonsamdi: Mmm... go ta da old village across da water. Take it back. I help ya den.<br />
<br />
Bwonsamdi: Spirits of da Darkspear! Arise! Take up da ancient mask! Take up de bloody spears! You'll be followin' Vol'jin now!<br />
<br />
Bwonsamdi: Now go, use me boon wisely.<br />
<br />
Takin' da island:<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: Don't be underestimatin' Zalazane. He be a tricky foe. Cunning and strong in da voodoo. Are ya ready? Move on.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: It be time. Hex master! Da sons and daughters of da Darkspear have returned. We gonna drive you to da sea.<br />
<br />
Zalazane: You ain't be doin' nothin' of da sort, Shadowhunter! Da Echo Isles are mine!<br />
<br />
Zalazane: Witness da powa of me voodoo! You ain't leavin' dis island alive!<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: We can't be lettin' him get away.<br />
<br />
Zentabra: Dere ain't no escapin' Zentabra. Not while he's on dese islands.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: Den find him, Wise one. Go.<br />
<br />
Zentabra: He be just west o' here workin' at some black magic.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: Not for long. Time to finish dis ting.<br />
<br />
Zalazane: *ominous cackle*<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: Give up, Zalazane. It be over now.<br />
<br />
Zalazane: You fool! I ain't runnin' away! I lured you here to kill you with your own precious tribe.<br />
<br />
Zalazane: No matter. I can't be touched. No living ting can make its way through this barrier. Da Echo Isles be Zalazane's to rule, Shadowhunter, for now and forever!<br />
<br />
Bwonsamdi: *ominous cackles better than Zalazane*<br />
<br />
Zalazane: Who? Who that be?<br />
<br />
Bwonsambi: Zalazane! What ya tinkin' takin' dat which be mine. Da Darkspear dead are my domain, Sorcerer, and now you're gonna be one o' dem.<br />
<br />
Zalazane: N... no... no... NO!<br />
<br />
Epilogue:<br />
Vol'jin: A fittin' end for so foul a troll. Bwonsamdi, you have my tanks and dat of all da Darkspear. We will continue to honor as is propa.<br />
<br />
Bwonsamdi: It will be good to hear da Darkspear drums once more. You take care now, son of Sen'jin. Bwonsamdi will be waitin' for ya on da otta side.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin: Time ta return to da village. Time to rebuild our home. Da Darkspear's home. Will ya be stayin' wit us, wise Zentabra.<br />
<br />
Zentabra: My fate be entwined wit yours now, Vol'jin, for good or for ill. I be stayin'.</div></div><hr />

Much appreciated.

Heroic looks like it's brutal on tanks, especially with a breath every 8 seconds. I'd imagine fire/shadow resist on the two tanks would help. Get out your H LK stuff for shadow breath and maybe an ony trinket/ring for fire breath/elementals ;)</div></div><hr />

It almost sounds like you don't think you should notify people if less than a certain % of people get hacked from your site.<br />

Finally....Bill Amend play wow also<br />
<br />
Love it!<br />
<br />
<br />
There was an inteview with Bill Amend wayyy back in 2005 that said he played a Druid on my server (Bronzebeard - US). Pretty sure the interview was on Allakhazam, or something, google probably knows. Hard to say if he's still there or not.<br />

So... You take an acknowledgment of your website and a little joke as &quot;making fun of you&quot; and so you're not going to post their video anymore?<br />
<br />
A little touchy, eh Boubouille?<br />
<br />
Pretty sure it was a joke, big guy.</div></div><hr />

Lack of news. Can't win. If he posted barely anything &quot;y'all&quot; would be complaining about nothing being posted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smashfanDS</div><div class="date">2010-06-01, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read MMO Champion because the format is simple and there's no better source for info on the game than a dataminer. <br />
<br />
I have never watched the MMO report because I am completely uninterested in having superficial commentary and CGI effects in a video when I can simply read the facts. I have no idea who Casey or this person named after a soup ingredient is. I have no idea what was said or the personalities involved. I've never posted on the MMO Champion forums, but created an account just because I felt I had to reply to this.<br />
<br />
Quitting a spiel, because you say your dignity is offended in some way, so you can stage a big comeback, is the most petty, prima-donna behavior there is. It was in bad taste when Tiger Woods did it. It was in bad taste when MJ did it. It was in bad taste when Rush Limbaugh did it. And you're not equal to any of them in significance or impact. <br />
<br />
You can go ahead and read them tea leaves and let us know when you feel man enough to do whatever it is you do again. It's like the 15-year-old girl who makes a big show of being dismissive of everyone then sits by the phone and wrings her hands, waiting for a call from some admirer. If anything you do is worth doing, you don't need to wait for a sign from God or peals of admiration to do your thing. Just do it or don't. <br />
<br />
The direct juxtaposition with a flippantly unapologetic follow-up to a virus issue - 3/4 of the way down the page no less, dismissing it on the basis of proportion, and referring to your readers in the possessive (&quot;my users&quot;), just makes you look even more small. Again, I don't know this person, don't really want to, just my two cents. Conan O'Brien doesn't refer to his viewers in the possessive, why should you?<br />
<br />
Seriously, WoW doesn't need any more Mings - writers of mediocre wit and insight and chock full of one-dimensional self-obsession prattling on about garbage that has nothing to do with the game.<br />
<br />

It certainly wasn't the episode he just posted, so I'm wondering what the front page is talking about ???</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SilverLynx</div><div class="date">2010-06-01, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They told Boub to &quot;double-bag it&quot; which means &quot;wear two condoms&quot; in reference that the site got a virus, ie: an STD.<br />
<br />
Boub, I don't think he meant any harm, really. He's just poking fun. Especially since it wasn't a big deal after all. I don't know, the writer seems to be a big fan of this site and it seems a little over the top to get that emotional about something he wrote.<br />
<br />
But then I'm not you, and this isn't my site to &quot;take it personally&quot; about. <br />
<br />
My only concern would be that it does make the site look bad to basically announce to all the MMO geeks that mmo-champ is virus-laden. But for that, all you have to do is tell them to make an announcement next week to state what the deal was.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it was in bad taste, but it seems so strange to me to start feuding and demanding apologies from your end.</div></div><hr />

Which is strange, as using two condoms is actually less effective than using one, ans the increased friction would cause them to break easier...</div></div><hr />
