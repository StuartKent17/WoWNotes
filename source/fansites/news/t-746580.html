Password Security Information<br />
Seriously, listen to the guy. Getting your WoW account stolen and restored within a few days is one thing, losing your hotmail account, your MSN contacts, and fighting with the tech support to get your password back is another. Yes, you can replace &quot;hotmail&quot; with anything else, you can even replace it with &quot;puppies&quot; because, yes, they will steal your puppies too, that's how evil keyloggers are.<br />
We have been helping players deal with account theft for years now, and unfortunately, roughly a third of players make a very basic security mistake: using the same password for all of their security needs.<br />
<br />
If you are serious about protecting your account and your personal security, your Battle.net password should be different from your email account password -- or other personal passwords for that matter!<br />
<br />
No one wants account thieves rooting around in their personal email, address book, and contact lists. Too often we see thieves breaking in to this information because their target has used the same password across multiple types of accounts. Not only can this give thieves access to your account, it can lead to compromises far outside of Battle.net as well.<br />
<br />
Itâ€™s immensely important that everyone use separate passwords for separate applications, including games. Secure passwords have both numeric and alphabetical values, and are usually at least 10 characters in length.<br />
<br />

Ysera open eyes<br />
As I've said before, her eyes are very intentionally open. This is, in fact, part of the fiction and will be explained in one of our upcoming novels as well as a future event in game.<br />
<br />
If it suits you, feel free to RP going CRAZY INSANE after looking into her eyes in Hyjal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399010284/ysera-model-feedback/))<br />
<br />
Bloat vs. Choice<br />
I think the word &quot;bloat&quot; has become like the word &quot;clunky&quot; in these forums. It's so often used as a synonym for &quot;I would have designed this differently&quot; that it has lost a lot of specific meaning.<br />
<br />
I think in the end one of the things we've really learned about what players are looking for in a talent tree is that they are often looking for different things. Some players are perfectly happy spending every point on say damage. Damage is what they do, so any point not related to damage feels wasted. Some players want every possible talent build to be legit. They don't want there to be any wrong answers such that they could almost assign points at random and have something that was functional and diverse. Some players, and this surprised us a little, like to have the ability to make bad choices and are perfectly happy making wrong choices -- to them the freedom to choose trumps the desire for power. Some players just want every point and agonize about having to leave anything out. Some get really bent out of shape at the thought of spending even 1 talent point on a talent that they may not use say once every 30 min or so. They would rather respec into a situational ability when that situation comes up rather than have it just in case. Some are mostly interested in just seeing something different. They are less interested in the perfect talent tree than they are in having them change over time. Even powerful abilities feel like old hat and they want the new hotness. You see this a lot for the classes whose talent trees changed earliest in Cataclysm, who are now wondering when &quot;their overhaul&quot; is coming. Opposing them are the nostalgia buffs who can't stand the thought of any talent or ability going away because it's iconic for their class.<br />
<br />
I'm really not building towards any kind of conclusion with any of that. It has just been interesting to see the feedback. I guess I can offer that you might want to be careful about who you think you are speaking for when you say &quot;we feel this&quot; or &quot;we don't want that.&quot; Players, even the microcosm of the forum community, want different things.

Holy Shield / 15% block<br />
Yeah, as some of the other posters said the issue is not really whether 4.5% or 8% (which is pretty liberal) is the amount of damage reduced. You're comparing full uptime to no uptime. If a paladin refuses to use their mitigation talents (i.e. stubbornly or sloppily choose not to use Holy Shield ever) then they are going to take more damage and suffer the consequences.<br />
<br />
The issue is how catastrophic is it if you are sloppy and let Holy Shield slip off for a short time or choose to use Word of Glory instead. The answer is probably: not very.<br />
<br />
Fifteen percent block is rarely going to make the difference between you being alive or dead. It will make a difference over the course of a fight in how much damage you take and therefore how much mana your healers need to invest. For that reason it's an excellent idea to keep Holy Shield up a lot. But if you let it fall down every now and then, you probably won't explode. (And let's remember there are several emergency buttons if you are on the verge of explodination that will mitigate a lot more damage than a block.)<br />
<br />
The reason I keep comparing it to 15% damage reduction, is because damage reduction affects every hit you take. Block is a chance to take less damage on every swing. Integrated over the course of an entire fight, you will probably block 15% more with Holy Shield up. But if you let it drop for a few boss swings, you are going to take far less than 15% more damage. In fact, you may take no extra damage at all (i.e. you would have blocked anyway). In fact, you may take no damage at all (i.e. you dodged or parried). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399010971/gc-please-stop-understating-15-block/))<br />
<br />
Holy Shield uptime<br />
I would say we are actually giving you control over your ability to survive. Today paladin tanking is very automated. Today the control isn't in your hands. We need to change that.<br />
<br />
Look, nothing on normal mode is going to be tuned to the point where a paladin tank who lets Holy Shield fall down wipes the group. On heroic mode, yes, you will probably be asked to play to the best of your ability. That's the purpose of those challenges. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399010971/gc-please-stop-understating-15-block/))<br />
<br />
Why is Holy Shield duration so short?<br />
The reason we haven't done that is we're concerned that once you have any Holy Power left for extra things, that you then assume you'd be balanced around those extra things. So for example, the model goes from paladins having to keep 15% block up to having to keep 15% block up *and* heal themselves every rotation. That's still a model we might consider though.<br />
<br />
We're happy with the bones of the design. The details and tuning aren't quite right yet, but we have many ideas left to try. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399010971/gc-please-stop-understating-15-block/))<br />

Shadow Power<br />
Shadow Power is now called &quot;Blackout&quot; and is a passive talent tree bonus for picking the tree. It provides 200% crits to Shadow spells. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26398980740/concerning-shadow-priests/))<br />
<br />
Archangel and Evangelism<br />
Archangel and Evangelism don't stack. The intent is that Dark Archangel is used when burst matters more than sustained damage (Dark Evangelism = Sustained, Dark Archangel = Burst), and not really something you'd do rotationally. In PvE you might do it if the target is going to die soon (when sustained dps really doesn't really matter), for target swapping, right before Bloodlust etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262987070/shadow-priest-concerns-for-cataclysm/))<br />
<br />
Mind Spike redesign<br />
There are some additional Shadow changes that are upcoming, including a slight re-design for Mind Spike. The role for Mind Spike is still something you can do when you don't have the opportunity for your full blown rotation, but we also don't want you to feel like you have to work it into your normal rotation.

<br />
Mind Flay<br />
Mind Flay is going back to a 3 sec cast time. As sometimes happens in beta, the data were pulled right while we were changing the spell, resulting in it being bugged. Sorry. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262987070/shadow-priest-concerns-for-cataclysm/))</div></div><hr />

This dialogue intrigues me.

Nice to see someone at Blizzard has read the Bhagavad Gita ... or at least the Wiki article on the Manhattan Project. Doesn't seem like thats where thats coming from. &quot;I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, &quot;Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.&quot;&quot; ~ Oppenheimer. I definitely see the similarities, but I think in this specific case, I think we just have a simulacrum.</div></div><hr />

Also, pallies are the most played class, so 16% of wow's pop did give a crap about em :P<br />
<br />
i made a mistake with what i first posted here but ill rephrase it for those that may of saw what i put, i got alex a little mixed up with some of ysera lore wise etc etc anyway what i think is this old woman voice is perfect for alex, take this bit copied from wowiki;<br />
&quot;Alexstrasza would be known as the Life-Binder, working to safeguard all living creatures of Azeroth. Due to her supreme wisdom and limitless compassion for all living things, Alexstrasza was crowned the Dragonqueen and given dominion over her kind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now take what wowiki says about ysera being the mother of cenarius (or adoptive mother)etc etc , to not portray these 2 as being older wiser caring motherly pair of sisters , you know the one you look up to watches over you protects you etc etc etc , it would be crazy to put a young voice on them it just would not fit there roles. Im crap at explaing things when i have just woke up but im sure you know where im coming from when you think about it. Pefect choice on blizzards behalf to make her sound old imo :)<br />
<br />
edit , just to add i havnt cant remember hearing a voice for ysera lol wether they have done one of i just cant remember it i dont know ive just woke up but yea alex sounds older...perfect and so should ysera imo for the above reasons in my post.</div></div><hr />

The basic requirement to have a long password with letters, capitals and numbers is to prevent two common password attacks, brute force (trying a lot of different passwords like &quot;aaaa&quot;, &quot;aaab&quot;, etc) and a dictionary attack (trying common words like &quot;chair&quot;, &quot;password123&quot;, etc).<br />
<br />
There are only very few people who can remember complex passwords, and then for multiple accounts too. Seriously, who is going to remember aJHshdashd28AOjs for their email and then Ai89J8cPoX1 for their Battle.net account? That's where passphrases come in.<br />
<br />
Passphrases are entire phrases used for a password, rather than random gibberish. This makes it both very easy to remember the password, but also secure (because it cannot be cracked easily... and they're usually way longer too). Take this as an example: &quot;My account password is secure because it contains the numbers 3, 2 and 6&quot;. It's way too long for anyone to crack (using either brute force or a dictionary attack) and can also not be cracked using &quot;rainbow tables&quot; (a common but complex way to crack passwords, I won't go into details).<br />
<br />
You could even use similar passwords for different accounts, without compromising the security! Eg for your email you could use &quot;My email password is quite secure because it contains the numbers 3, 4 and 6&quot; and for your Wow account use &quot;My Wow password is quite secure because it contains the numbers 3, 4 and 7&quot;. Then you basically only have to remember the phrase (which is way easier than remembering &quot;Ai89J8cPoX1&quot;) and a slight deviation for each account (&quot;email&quot; and &quot;6&quot; vs &quot;Wow&quot; and &quot;7&quot;).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am one that does believe in using very difficult different passwords on all my accounts. To give you an example for my email account I use something like L95rXi2AI46qB and for my WoW account I would use something like mZ7v3Ky84N1iD0A. I have used the same type of passwords on all my accounts for over 10 years. NEVER changed any of them and I never had any of my accounts compromised. I've had the same WoW password since Dec 04'. It's important to use both numbers and letters, both upper and lower case. I would never use any type of word or name in a password. If you have problems remembering your pw than write it down. But like anything else if you're careless with your accounts than it doesn't matter how difficult your pw is, your account will be compromised.</div></div><hr />

If Blizzard can explain what happened, I'll consider continuing my subscription.

The system they were using (account names) was more secure than the new system (email address). Security is not an absolute, there is just more secure and less secure and changing over to using email addresses as your logon made the system less secure. What did blizzard gain by doing this? Nothing as far as I can tell therefore they not only wasted time and effort in the changeover, they also made the system less secure in the process.

Security is not an absolute, there is just more secure and less secure and changing over to using email addresses as your logon made the system less secure. What did blizzard gain by doing this? Nothing as far as I can tell therefore they not only wasted time and effort in the changeover, they also made the system less secure in the process. It is the kind of idea that should have been shot down the moment it was proposed.You're missing the fact here that you can now change your login name.<br />
<br />
You do it simply by changing your battle.net email address and you can do it in minutes. Click a couple of confirm links in a few emails and it's done. I was able to do this several times over about an hour once. If you have a mail server you can change it even easier.<br />
<br />
Change it to something really obscure that only you can remember and do not use it anywhere other then battle.net<br />
<br />
You could not do this with the old system - if a hacker had your login name he effectively had half of your login information forever.<br />
<br />
Now you can change it at the drop of a hat EG I needed a friend to test something on the PTR. I gave him my account info then changed it to a new email and new password immediately after he told me his test was sucessful.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pbean</div><div class="date">2010-08-09, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems you're all just saying stuff about security. Using email addresses for account names doesn't make it any less secure. If you choose to have the same password for both your email account and your Battle.net account then you're just being stupid (and doing something everyone has been telling your for years not to do).<br />
<br />
<br />
I am one that does believe in using very difficult different passwords on all my accounts. To give you an example for my email account I use something like L95rXi2AI46qB and for my WoW account I would use something like mZ7v3Ky84N1iD0A. I have used the same type of passwords on all my accounts for over 10 years. NEVER changed any of them and I never had any of my accounts compromised. I've had the same WoW password since Dec 04'. It's important to use both numbers and letters, both upper and lower case. I would never use any type of word or name in a password. If you have problems remembering your pw than write it down. But like anything else if you're careless with your accounts than it doesn't matter how difficult your pw is, your account will be compromised.<br />
<br />
I thought since you quoted me you would have read my post, but apparently you didn't. Your random strings are actually less secure than the passphrases I described. Why? Simply because they're shorter so it's more likely that in the foreseeable future they're going to be able to crack it. Passphrases, as I described, are much, much longer than your average password (and even than those random strings of yours) and cracking them would take so much longer (every 1 character it's longer increases its complexity by a power of 62, the number of lowercase and upper case letters and digits; so even more if punctuation is allowed).<br />
<br />
The fact that passphrases are also easier to remember than &quot;normal&quot; password is just a side effect. Yes, using a common word as a password is bad, very very bad indeed. But using a common word in your password isn't inherently bad at all. So &quot;chair&quot; is one of the worst passwords imaginable, but the passphrase &quot;I am sitting on a char, having a good glass of wine.&quot; is very complex (mathematically) and with current systems would take longer than the presumed maximum age of the sun to crack.<br />
<br />
So, please, if you don't know stuff about security don't post about it all, since you're only going to confuse people. Another example: &quot;My wow account is totally secure, because I use a neat passphrase.&quot; is many orders of magnitudes more secure than either &quot;L95rXi2AI46qB&quot; or &quot;mZ7v3Ky84N1iD0A&quot;. And think about it... which one is easier to remember?</div></div><hr />
