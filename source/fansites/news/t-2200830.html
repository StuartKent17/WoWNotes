Weekly Bonus Event - Arena Skirmishes<br />
Sharpen your swords and reinforce your boards, because you’re called to the PvP Arena for the hectic mayhem of Skirmishes.<br />
<br />
This Week: Arena Skirmishes<br />
All week, from anywhere in Azeroth, open the Group Finder (default hotkey: i), select the Player vs. Player tab on the bottom of the window, and then under Arena Battles, choose either 2v2 or 3v3 and JOIN BATTLE. You’ll be matched up with teammates and provided with opponents to kill in the Arena.<br />
<br />
Look for the following all week long:<br />
<br />
<br />
Archmage Timear (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44172-the-arena-calls) for you.<br />
<br />
Quest requirement: Win 10 Arena PvP Skirmishes<br />
Reward: A PvP loot box <br />
<br />
Passive buff: +50% honor gains from Skirmishes<br />
<br />
<br />
If you’ve been looking to make some Honor gains, this is the week to do it!<br />
<br />

Command Center Hotfix<br />
Just to confirm, we recently applied a hotfix to change the Challenge Mission's unintentionally low reward. It now rewards 3.1 million Artifact Power at Artifact Knowledge 26.<br />
<br />
Does this count for the people who already sent their followers on the mission when it was still at the low AP value?<br />
If you sent your followers on the mission (and it hasn't completed yet) you'll receive the new, increased, amount of AP when the mission is completed.

Brewmasters in Patch 7.2.5<br />
Continuing to iterate...<br />
<br />
Special Delivery already fills the role of giving an offensive value to Brew charges, but not in a reliable way. Instead of the Purifying Brew -&gt; Breath of Fire buff, we're going to try making Special Delivery reliable. If you're the type of player that dislikes Brew charges being wasted when not tanking, Special Delivery already is attractive, and we're just going to make that feel better by being reliable. <br />
<br />
FYI, the first datamineable PTR build likely won't have this change.<br />
<br />
EDIT: &quot;Reliable&quot; meaning 100% proc chance, damage per keg reduced to compensate. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1055455-brewmasters-in-725/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753776674?page=28#559))<br />

<br />
DKs have two quests in the same zone that BOTH are horribly designed (this one I did myself). One has you kill a mob which spawns another mob when it gets low which you need to kill....but the first mob dies way too fast because 10 players are zerging it so the second mob never spawns. The other quest is even worse, having you right click corpses of 8 regular mobs and raising them from the dead...but the quest absolutely does not follow tagging rules, being totally random as to who can actually click the corpse of mobs killed. It was not uncommon to tag/kill 50 mobs just to be able to right click one of them.<br />
<br />
And did I mention that the zone is not faction specific? The quest is done in the Pit of Saron last boss area and has pretty much turned in to a huge PvP zone where 100 of DK's are gripping the other factions players in to their factions blenders. When I was doing it, makeshift sections of the arena were claimed by alliance and horde, with horde controlling most of the arena and alliance fighting out from a little corner. All around hilarity and frustration.<br />
<br />
Druids have to kill a mob that cannot be tagged by more than just a few people, leading to obvious problems with hundreds of people trying to kill it. The area is a bit bigger so PvP hasnt been as bad of a problem from what I heard, but still happens.<br />
<br />
Paladins have to right click mobs like the DK ones and they are first come, first serve and after they are activated, will walk around for like a minute before disappearing. Simply suffers from the same problem of not spawning mobs fast enough.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it was kind of ridiculous but if you can't enjoy a huge DK only free for all between alliance and horde I say there is something wrong with you. What was really cool was that the way you were assigned random corpses to raise (as opposed to those you had tagged personally) meant that often players had to get corpses in the other factions part of the zone. If both sides had just cooperated and given people safe passage the quest would have been a lot easier for everyone, since they didn't it meant the whole thing was made a lot harder for everyone involved. A nice little commentary on the war between the alliance and the horde and maybe even on war in general.<br />
<br />
Most people just went with how ridiculous it was, a very vocal few couldn't stop crying about it though. As if it was a personal affront that the experience they were having didn't correspond to some ideal they had in their head. I mean, you have to be pretty inattentive at this stage to not know that doing any content in the first hour it opens is going to be mayhem, that's part of the charm, the DK quest was more mayhem than usual but I don't think anyone can honestly claim to be surprised. If that's going to bother people then they can just wait a day to do it when the initial rush has passed. I know I don't personally like levelling right at expansion launch so I usually play a few hours the first night then take a few days off to let the rush die down. I mean it's a game, we all presumably play it for fun. If you are not enjoying it, go do something else for a while and come back later. You get enough time in work or study where you have to do something even though you are not enjoying it, have more self respect than to let your gaming time be like that too.</div></div><hr />
