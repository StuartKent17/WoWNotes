The bomb drops! This week, Chris and Sammy let Paul Jr. in on a critical piece of news about the project, and we meet the Horde and Alliance crewmates in New York. The teams have accepted their quest and are ready to roll, but will they be able to rise to the challenges ahead? Don’t miss a minute of the action as pressure mounts and bikes start to take shape. And don’t forget: the winning team’s bike will become an epic FREE in-game mount, so spread the word to your guildies and throughout your faction—and when the time comes, be ready to vote!<br />
<br />
Keep up to date on all of the latest episodes at www.AzerothChoppers.com, and let your faction’s war cry be heard with #AzerothChoppers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't it with all the series they show on Discovery where EVERYTHING has to be melo-dramatic and such a big deal? That's why I hate watching em, because they overact so much. If I didn't knew the program from before (Orange County Choppers), I would definately think that half of the &quot;mechanics&quot; are B-film actors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LoL.<br />
<br />
But the truth is: The bikes have likely already been done before they even started filming the first episode. ;-)<br />
That chopper-soap is going one for years already, they know how to do it without of having to worry about any fake drama deadlines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In next episodes we will see &quot;almost done bike&quot; falling apart, some drama between teams, some drama in teams, some delay from others like &quot;hey those parts should have been here yesterday, oh noes we are doomed!&quot;, some Paul Jr's drama that's &quot;it's the hardest thing i did in my life! (like every other before)&quot;, we would see some man tears probably, give up, raise of hopes, another give ups etc...and then, finally when we all think it is done, nothing gonna change the fate....all of sudden this missing part/nail or whatever, would be placed in the right place and voila...bike which was falling apart 5mins ago is now ready, sweet and dandy....and now some zoom-in on the finished stuff which looks like nothing in those 5 or 8 episodes and credits.<br />
<br />
Well, that's it.</div></div><hr />

The point is always, is it fun to watch? the answer this time is, imo, yes. <br />
<br />
The bikes are going to be awesome for sure. My only complain is that I can´t help to shake the feeling that: of course horde is going to win! duuh! Have you ever heard anyone shout &quot;Glory to the Alliance!&quot; in the streets?. When the vote comes Horde will win by a landslide I bet. I could be wrong though.<br />
<br />
I enjoy watching this sort of design and build stuff whenever I stumble onto it. I use to be a Monster Garage fan for a while and have seen plenty of custom job shows so this sort of thing is up my alley. I don´t think Blizzard is &quot;selling out&quot; because they did a 8 minutes web series tbh though. This is just some silly fun thing that rather wealthy and geeky companies can, and should, do more often.</div></div><hr />

What I'm wondering is whether or not the mounts will be faction only. Like, if the majority voted for the horde mount, will it be horde only?<br />
<br />
If that's the case, it's only normal for people to vote for faction pride rather than the &quot;coolest&quot; bike.</div></div><hr />

You never watched a reality show before. The entire premise of them is to create stupid drama for no reason other than so the people can spend 75% of the show complaining about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That or you have a show like Yukon Gold where each episode, something in their shitty machines break, they all get so worried and complain only to have it fixed 10 minutes later by some guy they find who says it's something bad but then turns in to ice jamming something because it just fucking snowed.<br />
<br />

What if the bikes are actually already completed or father along than they are showing? What if they already have the in-game models made? <br />
<br />
<br />
They will probably release both and put the loser in the Blizzard Store. For people crying their faction won't get one...well you are still actually getting the winning bike for free. You just have to play the other faction to use it. Same as any other race specific mounts you may have.</div></div><hr />

This type of show is about 4 minutes of things (not all at once, god forbid you might loose track of whats happening) and then 26 minutes of repeating those things, only with zooming and sound effects, also sometimes yelling.</div></div><hr />

Looks like Sam Didier has more than just bikes on his mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
He is very clearly looking at her eyes not her tits, he was discussing what was going on so he was addressing them both, so he would have to look at them both as he was talking. Like, what kind of Pig only addresses the guy, after he makes it known him and the women next to him joint own the company?</div></div><hr />

The fine print however is, that only your toons that are on the winning faction can use it actively.<br />
In a way.... You could argue that it's an incentive to roll toons on both factions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What if the bikes are actually already completed or father along than they are showing? What if they already have the in-game models made? <br />
<br />
<br />
They will probably release both and put the loser in the Blizzard Store. For people crying their faction won't get one...well you are still actually getting the winning bike for free. You just have to play the other faction to use it. Same as any other race specific mounts you may have.<br />
<br />
what if the entire thing is already finished and it's just being broadcast to the public now! I know, crazy talk, right? Reality shows don't work like that!</div></div><hr />

I thought so too. Evidently though this is being decided through twitter and the alliance supposedly has a larger fanbase there. Either way though, it is a stupid way to decide which faction gets a mount.</div></div><hr />

They also built a bike for the company that put up the new tower in NYC, of course the bike matching the occasion. <br />
I'd assume their custom bikes cost you a small fortune. Since you are guaranteed that your bike is the only one like that on the whole planet. <br />
They have cheap ones too, that have very little features and those cost already around 12k. <br />
For our case.. There's now a set of 6 professionals working on them for 5 weeks. There were already at least 2 weeks of work done to them, since we are starting with 2 frames already. That's quite a lot of labor costs right there. Plus material. Plus profits.<br />
I'd assume Blizz is going to have to rake out a total of about $100k+ for those two rides.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also i like how you spew out that &quot;resource&quot; argument like people do for everything. First of all, the devs have nothing to do with this and while this is pre-recorded, they probably had alot more pressing matters during SoO. all it was is Metzen asking about making bikes. You're basically saying a phone call followed by some interns with filming cameras costs us a raid tier. Also, if you say the devs taking part in this takes resource from WoD, i highly doubt they cut into development time for this, let alone the several hundred other devs dropped everything for this, or couldn't pick up the slack. They probably did this on their own time, or else it wouldn't have been pre-recorded and planned out in advanced.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - there's no point in making a filler tier tbh. It's just some insignificant raid instance with slightly better gear that will be replaced a month or two later. People will get bored a few weeks after and the time wasted to make it will have been in vein after it's been forgotten. Just look at RS. Anyways, there are atleast a hundred devs and only 6 blizzard reps here. Makes me doubt Azeroth Choppers even put a dent in WoD progress, it's too insignifcant. The pre-expansion event of 6.0. is more exciting than filler content anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3 hurrays for comprehensive reading!<br />
<br />
1. The people voted in American Idol and likewise programs aswell. Yet the entire thing was staged, going by what would give them the most viewers. You pressing a vote button doesnt actually mean they use that vote. Besides, theres a thing called &quot;Planning variables&quot;. Just like movies can have alternative endings, so can &quot;reality shows&quot;.<br />
<br />
2. Marketing gets planned atleast a year ahead at companies as big as Blizzard. So this was allready on the plan before SoO came out. They actively chose to add something useless caus they had marketing budget to spare, instead of putting that spare money in development.<br />
<br />
3. There was a small content patch planned to keep people occupied after SoO. But they didnt implement it due to resources. I never said a full raid tier.<br />
4. If u think theres interns behind those camera´s and thats actually a phonecall, and that entire scene hasnt been written out, ur delusional.<br />
<br />
5. That last sentence u wrote isnt even a sentence.</div></div><hr />

Some folks will buy into it. Like someone else said, he already has two frames ready to go, so there was some significant element of pre-planning. It's definitely a bit disingenuous, but it is a reality show after all. Paul Jr might not have agreed if it couldn't be shot in the same fashion as American Chopper<br />
<br />
The people who believe this show isn't a big act are probably the same people who watch other reality shows. The only &quot;reality&quot; show I ever watched is Bear Grills Ultimate Survival, and while I know that most of that is staged as well...at least you get to see some stuff, and you can't really fake putting a worm the size of my thumb exploding in his mouth.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">djones0305</div><div class="date">2014-04-24, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to the fact that you can only access the winning mount if you play the faction of that mount, everyone who plays mainly horde will vote for the horde one and everyone who plays mainly alliance will vote for the alliance. It's not going to be a contest of which is the better bike, just a contest of who votes more, people who play horde or people who play alliance. It's not like I'm going to vote for the alliance bike just because I think it's cool if I play horde. Then I'd never get to use it. Let's get real. Dayum blizz. You shoot down all of our ideas because you say it takes &quot;resources&quot; but now you've made some stupid reality series featuring bikes, one of which can't even function in reality due to the fact that it has treads as both the front and back tires, that isn't even a real contest instead of working on not ruining WoD for everyone who is already bitching about it. Da fuq.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tisane</div><div class="date">2014-04-24, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy !@#$ is it me or did Cody's appearance change drastically compared to the last time he was on the OCC show? He always used to look like a young, slim kid. Now he looks like a fatter, 'rough', adult :p The dude managed to look 25 years older within only 10 years time :D<br />
<br />
Also, I got the feeling Blizzard is using budget-parts for the bikes from what I've seen so far. I mean like normally OCC always gets their parts made by specialists, for which they have to wait a few weeks. But last time they had a few frames on standby already, now they have a couple of tires already out of nowhere. It's like they're using left-overs xD<br />
<br />
I love the endless drama like hearing 10 times; ''I'm not sure we can do this within 5 weeks'', ''I doubt we'll finish the bike''. I think it would be fun though if they actually have to cancel the bike because it takes too long xD. It would be a change.<br />
<br />
Lines such as Paul Jr. saying; ''I'm definitely feeling the pressure'', I wonder out of which line they've cut that part. Maybe the original line was something like; ''I need to go the toilet badly because I'm definitely feeling the pressure between my butt cheeks'' :p I can't imagine OCC being really all hyped up about a game.<br />
<br />
Also, if Chris Metzen would ever lose his job at Blizzard, no worries for him, he still has a talent for being an actor or a photo model :D</div></div><hr />

My brother is in fabrication and I have worked in his shop over the years and this just makes me cringe. I know these bikes are just for looks and not functionality but 5 weeks isn't enough time to build something of quality. But I guess it's okay for Blizz to give other people unrealistic time frames yet we are still in SOO and will be for at least another 5 months.... The hypocrisy amazes me.</div></div><hr />

But all this exaggeration is really hard to watch. I get it, blizzard is trying some new public approach, but please don't... As a long time warcraft fan I cannot bear to see you being complete sell outs, even if I know you are, you at least had the decency to hide it and pretend customer came first... but this show is just... I can't even find a word bad enough to describe it... I will not watch this show again.</div></div><hr />

At least they could have talked about the bike rather than the deadline - Blizzard imposing a ridiculous deadline on another company is fairly hilarious though. When is WoD coming again?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toiran</div><div class="date">2014-04-25, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So there was literally zero building of bikes, they always ruin this crap with the fake drama.<br />
<br />
Exact same thing with American Restoration, the first series, that show was amazing, it was all about the restoration of cool items, now, it's all about his life and wife and brother and this fake drama and blah blah blah, the actual restoration process takes up around 8 minutes of the 30 min show, never seen a show so ruined over the course of a series in my life, fuck history channel.<br />
<br />
Even the already 99% fake and set up Pawn Stars is getting worse with the fake drama and stories, urgh reality tv is so awful, especially when some of the shows could genuinely be interesting and good television.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And talk about a boys-only clubhouse atmosphere, sheesh. Blizzard, I am disappoint =/<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong. I rode bikes with my husband, and appreciate a lot about motorcycles, but this is just too freaking much. The testosterone is overwhelming. Plus even though I am a Horde player through and through, the whole Orcs expansion is combining with this to turn me off. Never thought i'd say it about Blizzard, but they have really lost some of their magic. This stuff they are doing is just cheap.</div></div><hr />

Nah, but the plans and frames probably were. They need to remain flexible depending on feedback they receive, but a real team of engins is probably going to make the choppers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now there's the whole &quot;we only have 5 weeks&quot; thing which is crap, considering that nobody has ever seen the bikes and this was probably filmed several months ago. So there's some fake drama right there. And it looks like they are kicking up the fake drama for episode 3 judging by the promo. <br />
<br />
My prediction: The drama will reach a boiling point by the last episode when fearing that Paul Jr. won't make the deadline Chris Metzen brings in Paul Sr. who then gets angry and smashes both choppers. Sorry fans, no mount for anybody.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragedaug</div><div class="date">2014-04-25, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the fabricated drama makes it nearly unwatchable for me. I'd rather just watch them making it, rather than watching them talk about how they are not going to be able to make it the whole time. I can only imagine I'm in the minority here as this seems to be pretty standard for reality TV. I might consider watching the next one with the volume off to see if that helps.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yolofaceroll</div><div class="date">2014-04-25, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the reason for the 5 weeks, is cuz in 5 weeks, wildstar launches. BOOM mystery solved. They had diablo 3 ros for Elder scrolls online, now they have Azeroth Choppers for Wildstar<br />
<br />
At least its something, coulda been worse, coulda been 6 more momths of SoO and losing more content promised at blizzcon</div></div><hr />

It's called a &quot;set&quot; and can typically be moved around to wherever it's needed. Revolutionary concept.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To quote Blizzard themselves.<br />
<br />
But a game is defined largely by its limitations<br />
<br />
So while I would want to think that they would cave and give players both bikes, them flying off the rails and thinking that pissing half of the player base off like that somehow makes World of Warcraft into a better game wouldn't surprise me.</div></div><hr />

And having the exact same company build 2 bikes?<br />
Meh.<br />
<br />
I haven't watched AC in a year or so but didn't they have the perfect match-up with OCC building one and PJD building the other?<br />
Flip for who does what and go from there.<br />
<br />
I get Blizzard wants to do something 'special' but using a part of a once popular tv show to do it just misses that mark completely imo.</div></div><hr />
