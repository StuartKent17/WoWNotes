Can't wait to see a video of how this actually plays out. I'm one of those wierdos who liked the goblin content in Cata, nice to see it coming back, it can be really amusing at times. <br />
<br />
I don't have a horse in this race, I'm liking the story from both sides, like watching a movie that cuts between two factions. It's war - everyone forgets how it started, and it's just about killing each other - and getting all full of righteous wrath at every turn. <br />
<br />
And, the Tyrande part feels right, if way, way, way overdue, she's been used as a prop with a fainting couch for a long time - and she's right, her kingdom should burn while everyone else is fighting for trope ore on an island with trolls? Fuck that noise, and putting Anduin in his place is awesome - she's 10,000 years old, she's seen some shit, and some kid who cries and runs away is gonna tell her what to do? And Genn joins in? Great writing! Her leaving with a big upraised middle finger is a 180 from the fainting goat she was in Legion, it's great stuff. <br />
<br />
Kill off Anduin. Please. He's pointless, useless, not interesting, and plays no pivotal role in anything. Let the horde have him, in exchange for all of their leaders the Alliance got to loot. Put a Steward in place in Stormwind, and leave it like that until you can develop a storyline bringing an Alliance leader forward who makes sense, is engaging and interesting, and is an actual leader, not some wimpy kid sitting on a throne while the world burns around him. He has no practical experience to be a strategist, he's a healer who belongs in the rear with the gear. Kill him. Fill him full of loot and candy and let the Horde beat on him. <br />
<br />
Well, as long as I don't need to worry about shadowy tentacles being rude, I'm fine with a bit of experimental magic.<br />
This is a serious mission, Fairwind.<br />
I am being serious. Nothing with tentacles has ever been polite to me.<br />
<br />
Big thumbs up, and it's just NPC chatter. If you're crying over this stuff, you're hopeless. This is the first time I've enjoyed any writing on the WoW team since before WOD. I've been extremely cynical, but I gotta admit, this is good stuff right here.</div></div><hr />

Correct - the Horde did attack Brenadam in Stormsong, however, and it is still a &quot;stalemate&quot; at this time. Going to guess that it will end up being Horde controlled during the pre-quests for the 2 Boss Raid that takes place under Stormsong.</div></div><hr />

I'm almost certain the dialogue you're talking about is the person who witnessed the horde fight the alliance bosses who tells us the story that enables us to fight the bosses as well to relive the experience. The story being told is past tense, because it is in the (not at all distant) past.</div></div><hr />

I dont thing the horde are the ones that get this option. Seems more like she was turned and the Alliance get the option. But I think you are correct, if the player spares, Maiev will kill. imo anyways</div></div><hr />

<br />
Possibly, but she has to die before she can be raised as a Dark Warden. She was an ally to the Horde on the Broken Isles, so some Horde members might be hesitant to kill her for that reason.<br />
Besides, &quot;What are you waiting for? Finish her.&quot; sounds more like something Nathanos would say. Maiev would probably be happy to put her out of her misery herself.</div></div><hr />

Um....no. She's been a part of the creative team since the start of the expansion. 8.1 is literally all her storytelling which is why there's so much Alliance bias.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why there is so much hatred toward Christie Golden from posters on here. It goes back years with them tearing down her novels and now her joining the team. Of course, your point will be ignored (or forgotten) the next time they don't like the turn the story in BfA is taking. I am enjoying the story myself, but I made a conscious choice to play both sides to see the story develop and I haven't been disappointed so far. That said, my heart will always be with the Wrynns and with Genn who I think is a terrific character.</div></div><hr />

For fucking real? Horde has pretty much only had victories so far this expansion and in the pre-expansion event and now they're raising and turning notable night elf characters and you're claiming Alliace favouritism? The Alliance haven't had a single meaningful victory against the Horde yet.</div></div><hr />

I don't know... how about the mere fact that your Warchief nearly brought the kaldorei into fucking extinction. We haven't killed Nathanos, we haven't killed Sylvanas, or any notable Horde lore character yet. We've only killed a character that no one really cares about so the Horde can have the Zandalari permanently on their side as an Allied race, and Talanji as queen. This is still a horde win no doubt.</div></div><hr />

I think the problem most people have is that they expect a clear 'winner' every time there is a conflict. But this is one of those situations where things are a bit more grey-in-grey. Story-wise, the death of Rastakhan is a blow to the moral of the Zandalari and their fleet is decimated. He's been their king for ages, and it will definitely strengthen the outlying factions like Blood Trolls and similar threats. If anything, it serves to destablize an ally of the Horde.<br />
At the same time, the operation did not go as smooth as planned and the Alliance took heavy casualties during the attack. If you read the dialogue you will see that they did not actually intend to kill the king, just force him to surrender and enter a stance of neutrality towards the Horde. Instead, this will drive them even closer towards the enemy.<br />
<br />
In short: It's a clusterfuck of a situation that resulted from a badly executed plan. Neither side got what they wanted, but both sides gained something from the whole thing as well.</div></div><hr />

He's pointless, useless, not interesting, and plays no pivotal role in anything. Let the horde have him, in exchange for all of their leaders the Alliance got to loot. Put a Steward in place in Stormwind, and leave it like that until you can develop a storyline bringing an Alliance leader forward who makes sense, is engaging and interesting, and is an actual leader, not some wimpy kid sitting on a throne while the world burns around him. He has no practical experience to be a strategist, he's a healer who belongs in the rear with the gear. Kill him. Fill him full of loot and candy and let the Horde beat on him. <br />
<br />
<br />
Anduin is the single most interesting character in the game, with the potential for great writing and storylines. I don't see Blizzard killing him for many expansions.</div></div><hr />

Anduin has become my favorite character once they killed off Varian. This expansion made me switch back to the alliance after being horde since BC. Glad to be back on the right side.</div></div><hr />

to be fair, her writing is pretty mediocre imho, and her books (oh which i read 4) are not really of the standard of an award winning writer (again tho, imo). so i feel like shitting on her is fair if we dont like her work, however anything beyond that, such as the death threats she got, is fucking waaaaaaaaay outa line</div></div><hr />

You mean killing a King that we have literally known was going to die since the Throne of Thunder makes up for the insanely better tuned racials and all that &quot;For The Horde&quot; nonsense at Blizzcon that got people attacked? The only people that don't blindingly see the Horde bias are Horde loyalists, lol. We get one up on the Horde and everyone cries &quot;But Horde bias, amirite?&quot;, and it somehow makes up for 900 Night Elf lives and the &quot;REEEEEE&quot; cinematic.<br />

This is EXACTLY why Blizzard shouldn't be biased towards the Horde, a bunch of crying children every time they don't get their way. It would help them grow up for someone to tell them &quot;No&quot; every once in a while.</div></div><hr />

Because Sylvanas isn't the entire Horde. You have a major Horde character (Baine) RIGHT THERE saying how fucked up it is.<br />
