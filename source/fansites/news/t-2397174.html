Well of course hunters figured out silly ways to use this and I was no exception.<br />
https://i.imgur.com/VFqKT6q.jpg<br />
The Murloc look was a tough to get but so worth it. Then Blizzard patched it and all the hunters with Metamorphosed, Murloc, Undead, Pirate, or Werewolf pets cried out in pain. Was still some of the most fun I had in Legion. Might not seem like a most memorable accomplishment but as a BM Hunter, any unique look is always worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had to upload a video, because explaining it just does not do it justice.<br />
The moment I got hit by Flame Rend, the priest cast Levitate on me and pushed me over the edge and I got stuck on terrain.<br />
<br />

My greatest accomplishment:<br />
Has not been fulfilled yet. Need another month.<br />
Looking really forward to it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Didn't notice the 'In Legion' part.<br />
Still going to leave this story below.<br />
<br />
I have many fond memories and screenshots, but this is my most prized.<br />
<br />
We were raiding in Wotlk as a casual guild. <br />
Just relaxing and having fun as a group of friends.<br />
<br />
Our mage got a Skype message during Tomb phase and panic blinked into the raid without knowing that he was the tomb and froze everyone.<br />
The whole vent lit up with laughter. We joked about it every time we fought Sindragosa again.<br />
<br />
The mage changed his name to 'Gnomesorc' at a later stage and we jokingly referred to him as 'Tombsorc'.<br />
<br />
Such great memories in Wotlk. I am sure every guild at the time had moments like this with Sindragosa and LK's Defile.<br />

After many attempts on the Mage Tower as a Vengeance DH - I finally killed him. Right as I was disconnected due to server maintenance (Look at the chat log)! I was eagerly waiting until the servers came back up to confirm if the kill actually counted!! Luckily it did! :)</div></div><hr />

The year was December 2003. I was in a mystical land known as Vanilla WoW. I had created a Night Elf Rogue only to find out that my buddies had all either created a human or dwarf. So unfortunately for me I had to run the long hard journey from Darnassas, take the boat to Darkshore, then take the boat to the Wetlands. I arrived at Menethil Harbor excited to begin my run to meet my friends. I only needed to cross the Wetlands to get there. What was unaware to me at the time, Blizzard had placed 2 or 3 super human crocodiles right past a small bridge as you left the safety of Menethil. They came out of nowhere!! I ran as fast as I could, unaware that these crocodiles were blessed with super speed. Every time I ran past that area I always remembered the beat down from those dang crocodiles.<br />

You're both right. There are two different posts. One has death only. One has death + accomplishment. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaymin</div><div class="date">2018-05-15, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My most memorable death was on Star Augur Mythic. It was actually a pull where we killed him for the first time. For me, it was the first boss I was playing on my mage, since before him I was a main healer as holy priest. If you look at the picture, you can tell that it didnt go as planned, the blinking mechanics were still kinda messy for me and I ended up blinking into a fel thingy on the ground. To make it even more funny, on that evening I was the only one recording the fight, so our kill video from Augur is funny as hell, half of the fight is a PoV from a dead me. <br />

<br />
Also if I were to include most memorable accomplishment, then it sure would be downing Mythic Argus with my guild. Finishing Legion with a group of amazing people, it meant a lot to me. Specially when I'm the guild master and we set-up as a new guild mid-Legion in the middle of The Nighthold progression. Wasnt always easy, but in the end I'm glad I have this group of people by my side. <br />

<br />
Favourite deaths were in patch 7.1 - Return to Karazhan, especially the Maiden of Virtue, which we found as a super challenging fight to coordinate to being with. Indeed, for the first night we were up so late trying that we gave up and had to re-try the following day. I enjoyed that Mythic Dungeon SO much! It was such a challenge, brought back insane nostalgia from TBC (the music) and got me super hyped for Legion and playing with my guild again. :) <br />
<br />
Fondest memories of wiping and improving until we beat it.<br />
<br />
Blizzard did a phenomenal job with Return to Karazhan - a perfect blend of old and new and I hope they do more of this in the future!</div></div><hr />

This is actually before the death (the only screenshot i have) <br />
We were at Blackhand waiting for 1 of the tanks and a group member set all the tables as a thank you for the run and he then ninja pulled the boss and wiped the group... Was kinda unexpected, frustrated and funny in a weird wow-players way</div></div><hr />

my most favorite moment might not seem like a great accomplishment, but for me seeing my Death Knight raising class mount, almost similar to how Lich King raised Sindragosa in WotLK cinematic was just amazing.</div></div><hr />

Most memorable death was wiping on M Mistress with my guild during ToS progress, 1034k hp left on the boss.</div></div><hr />

We were raiding back when EN was current and there occured a strange bug that wiped our raid and made our tank invincible<br />
we couldn't despawn the boss or release spirit and were just stuck in the instance until everyone got ported out by leaving the group<br />
<br />
it was a fun death,funnier was that our tank got stuck and couldn't die at all and the boss just kept bugging out</div></div><hr />

This is a recent accomplishment I did. Got the Valarjar Stormwing mount from the Valarjar paragon box after 58 attempts. It was probably even more than that, because I didn't have the Rarity addon for the first 15-20 boxes. It's been a long journey, but at least now I can say I have all mounts, pets, toys from the paragon boxes so I'm really happy.</div></div><hr />

My most memorable accomplishment was finishing the Guardian Druid mage tower. I don't tank at all (and it was at a later patch), but still, it was amazing finishing it. I don't actually have a SS from the moment, just my silly hiding in the bush with it. I have a video thou '^'.<br />
<br />
About the death...i was on my rogue, trying out outlaw. Was flying through Suramar, got a dungeon call and thought it was fine going in while flying. When i got out, i started falling from the sky and thought &quot;it's ok, rogues don't take damage from falling&quot;..just to find out that no, Outlaws don't have that trait '^'.... i stared at the screen for 10s and started laughing xD (ofc i didn't took a SS =\ ).</div></div><hr />

This is what happens when you use the horse tail item on hallows end and then a prismatic crystal to swap appearances with someone twice. You keep the appearance in combat and it completely messes up your animations like charge,ww and heroic leap and looks ridiculous, i esp recommend trying this with ww monks flying serpent kick but apparently killing people like this pisses them off so half their team chased me for the whole game making us win. At the end i had 29 deaths and the rest of my team 3.</div></div><hr />

Since then I've been telling myslef every expansion I was gonna do it ... but in Legion, finally:<br />
<br />

<br />
Outland was by far the most painful since many quests continue into other zones and than back, especially Netherstorm, Blade's Edge and Nagrand (I tried Nagrand on 3 different toons but actually finally got int Shadowmoon if i remember correctly X.X but hey, i love being in Nagrand). Another example is that for whatever zone (i forgot) i had to redo the introduction to Shattrath. Dragonblight was also a pain, as was Zul Drak (i hate that zone to begin with) because i forgot about the Ring of Blood or w/e it is there and that it starts in Dalaran. There is probably a more hassle free way of doing it with addons or guides or w/e but I just winged it so I hit a few rly tough walls.<br />
<br />
Weirdly i finished my Loremaster in Grizzly Hilly, which is one of my fav zones and I never noticed I didn't have that one yet. One of my old WoTLK toons had only 3 quests missing for it but since I love Grizzly I decided I was gonna do them all on my mage again and read it all. The stars alligned and I got the achievement in amberpine Lodge which might be an all time favorite wow location for me :D fun tidbit, I than chaged my HS to it and it's still there :D its a mage, i dont need a HS :P</div></div><hr />

This is from my first kill video on Mythic Gul'Dan. Our BM hunter who also was a top damage dealer decided to jump off the platform during the pull (i could only catch the red streaks coming off of him in my video). But shockingly we still ended up killing Gul'Dan during the very same pull.<br />

Our Heal got a dc and couldnt join the fight. We already accepted our defeat, and went yolo on the monk heal.<br />
I dont know why it worked, i guess they were too confident about the free win,<br />
but we put the chaos nova on the group, then arcane torrent, followed by winter is coming stun and the heal just died.<br />
The dps didnt even try to win it 2v2 after their healers death, they just embraced their loss. I can only imagine their reaction about losing this seemingly free win :D<br />
It was a really funny moment, because our healer was so sorry for his dc that should have caused a lose and no one expected this outcome.<br />

In MoP there was a fairly frequent lag bug that caused mounts not to display properly when flying. Instead, it look that you were swimming though the air. And two person mounts made you looking like Superman carrying Lois Lane.</div></div><hr />

by far my most rage inducing and favourite death at the same time. <br />
<br />
Paladin tank challenge was really really hard.<br />
<br />
I remember it took me around 120 attempts as a 913 Prot paladin.<br />
<br />
The fight is just rough and not designed for prot paladins at all (makes me think why Blizzard thought it was a good idea).<br />
<br />
You get knock backed? You're done.<br />
<br />
Got no leap, jump, charge or anything like other tanks.<br />
<br />
Want to kill the eyes? don't have a spammable ability like moonfire.<br />
<br />
And to top it all off for some reason the paladin tank challenge literally had double the HP of the other tank challenges which were the same if I remember correctly. I wonder if they ever fixed that.<br />
<br />
So to summarize.<br />
<br />
You get knock-backed once you're done.<br />
<br />
Insane DPS check for no reason? Something like 1 million which was super HIGH for its time.<br />
<br />
Eyes that were hard to deal with.<br />
<br />
And you'd be out of mitigation rather quickly since 3 SOTR.</div></div><hr />

Well the image came as a surprise - I was thinking of posting the &quot;elevator of death&quot; in ABT but didn't have a screenshot, so I headed to the dungeon to take one. Upon teleporting to the Vindicaar, the floor spawned a bit too slowly and my character effortlessly fell through the metal shell of the spaceship to her death on the ground of Argus! My jaw dropped so hard during the turn of events that I forgot to press the goblin glider or anything, only to realize after that this was precisely the screenshot of dramatic death that I seek. Ha!</div></div><hr />

I was doing the Priest Mount quest, and i got DC as i was in the underwater submarine. The game could appently not regonise this and booted me into the instance of the place but without actually starting the quest in the area to get the Mount. In the far distance I could see the Beam of the maelstream, and that is how my priest, drowned in an alternative universe of the shamans class hall<br />

So I got my Tusks of Mannoroth after 1127 kills across all of my plate characters and all raid difficulties (heroic and mythic SoO). My warrior alone has 1043 kills on garrosh hc.<br />
worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/twisting-nether/konman/pve<br />
<br />
I started farming them after 7.3 patch in Legion and only had 5 kills of hc garrosh before 7.3 patch on my warrior.<br />
<br />
So it has to be my best accomplishment in Legion (even tho it's not legion content), next to EN and Nighthold mythic raid clears, only because I haven't raided &quot;seriously&quot; before Legion. But those are not so special to me, anyways ;). Tusks &gt; All.<br />

I was flying around in dalaran, and all of a sudden I feel out of my travel form, and phased into another zone, no players around me, just NPC's, and my dead body</div></div><hr />

My biggest accomplishment in legion or most memorable death?<br />
After weeks of farming, staying awake at night, writing journal about when and on which server vyragosa spawned or i found her or time-lost's corpse.<br />
I finally killed him, yea that was my biggest accomplishment. But as u can see, i killed him and he fell on the wall and got stuck there and i couldnt loot him (u need to stand on the ground to loot stuff) yea, i died inside then( most memorable death checked).<br />
<br />
But to not end with the sad tone, some guy passed me when i was staring at the corpse not being able to loot him and he gave me the ride on his sandstone drake with allowed me to loot the time-lost (you can loot when u are sitting on the passengers sit) That was the happiest day in wow for me.</div></div><hr />

My most memorable death wasn't a death of my own but rather an epic death I caused for another when I achieved the feat of single-handedly killing a 10-man Paladin Multi-boxer who was terrorizing Redridge Mountains with a well-timed Spike-Toed Booterang dismount on the lead boxer which caused him to fall to his death and the rest of their multi-box to follow suit.<br />
<br />
Then as a bonus, I ran into the same multi-boxer later on in the same zone who I guess remembered me, and after a short cat and mouse game of them attempting to dismount and attack me in the sky (which would of killed me if he managed to), I guess in his blind rage forgot that he literally just used his Blessing of Protection a few moments ago, so in a face-palming fashion, he attempted to attack me in the sky again but this time promptly fell to his death, he and his whole multi-box. Luckily this time I was recording video of this epic event: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHxFo_9ATBw</div></div><hr />

I really enjoyed the riddle leading to this beautiful Lucid Nightmare -mount. I did use the guide that community had already put together, but still. The maze in the end required you to use your own brains, because it was unique to every individual player. I spent several hours doing the whole riddle and enjoyed every one of them immensely. A very memorable experience!</div></div><hr />
