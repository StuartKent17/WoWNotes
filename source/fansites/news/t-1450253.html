Nerve Strike now causes a successful Kidney Shot or Cheap Shot to also reduce the damage dealt by player targets by 25% (down from 50% for player targets). No changes to the talent when used against non-player targets.<br />

Warbringer now causes Charge to stun the target (used to cause Charge to root a target) for 3 seconds, reducing movement speed by 50% for 15 seconds, and generates 20 Rage.

Are you going to look at raid buffs and which classes provide them for 6.0?<br />
Yep, there are a few changes planned for that, but not ready to announce details. Most unchanged, just filling in a couple holes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424002066181132288))<br />
<br />
Can we can get a healer training dummy in WoD? Something we can heal to put us in combat to check trinket procs / weak auras etc<br />
I'll see what we can do. No promises, but I definitely see the value. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424783948263092225))<br />

Could you make force of nature benefit from eclipse mastery or at least make them do more dmg in solar since they cast wrath?<br />
Depends whether they need it to compete with the other talents on their row. It's something we'll certainly consider. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424980642162434049))<br />

why weren't Monks a hero class?<br />
If you mean starting at a high level, because it didn't fit the story we were trying to tell with them. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424715378334257152))<br />

in wod will spriests get a new singel target ability like ms and mb to go with the new singel target talent?<br />
No new abilities, but we are planning to allow the to specialize more for single target, if they choose. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424983697960345601))<br />
first off im rly glad u are doing the specialization, but spamming ms and mb a whole fight seems abit boring <br />
If you're referring to Clarity of Power, the rotation is more complex than that. DP, MF, SW: D... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425000905293836289))<br />

melee as they follow ABA rule - Always be attacking - white hits are auto. So imp standing around = dps lose plain and simple<br />
The 'ABC Rule', as you call it, is very much true for the vast majority of casters, whose limited resource is time. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424248199780368385))<br />
The Imp's limited resource is energy, not time. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424248292419969025))<br />
Imp/Fel imp is a caster therefore they must follow the ABC rule of A(Always) B(Be) C (Casting), every caster knows that.<br />
No, they don't. They're an energy-based caster. Their DPS is limited by their energy regen, *not* their cast time. Really. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424247563512864768))<br />
around. His energy doesn't regein as fast as he can cast, so at some point 2min in he start standing around until he get 40<br />
It sounds like you think that him standing around at all is a DPS loss. It's not. His energy is 100% of his damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424240770774601728))<br />
As long as he's not energy capping, he is doing 100% of his potential DPS. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424240896335298560))<br />
<br />
Will green fire quest chain scaling up for WoD or let it in current lvl so every one will one shot it ? I wote for scale up.<br />
Stay current level. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424983060765868032))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
More players starting at 90 in WoD will increase BG queue times sub-90. Will BG brackets recombine in WoD (e.g. 70-79, 80-89 etc.)?<br />
I think we can combine more. The item squish, level and ilevel scaling mean power isn't as varied. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/424642604710363136))<br />
<br />
btw will you ever make it so we don't need to bake /focus arenaX into our macros?<br />
focus is implemented like targeting. If someone stealths, it drops. Will look into it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/424629912129912832))<br />
<br />
Is it purposeful that my worgen turns into a human when I enter an arena? Finally getting into PVP btw <br />
Welcome aboard. Arena clears a lot of auras. This is one we probably shouldn't clear. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/424616166040932352))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Welp, WarFrame's added to the &quot;doubt I'll play that again&quot; list. Great movement, runs really well, but ugh the crafting/microtransations etc<br />
Personal design interest: when is spending $ in real &quot;fun&quot;, when does it suck &amp; what can games learn from that? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/425059862859362304))<br />
For instance, paying $ for clothes on sale = fun, paying $ to get your passport faster = lame (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/425060181869735936))<br />

Given the existence of Juggernaut, I think moving the stun to a talent is fair. Reworking the talent would probably be preferable, but w/e.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is definitively the right way: the charge-stun is one of the most problematic things on warriors: not only that you are extremely mobile: with the 2-charges-talent you can interrupt casts up to 4 times in a row.<br />
<br />
Iconic warrior ability; nice words when you simply want to say: i want to stay overpowered. Even now warrior is very strong: and you can complain when you were nerfed like shadow priests were.<br />
<br />
Also: if you want the stun, you can spec it.</div></div><hr />

Aaaaah go drink some tea.<br />
<br />
Its an awesome art piece, and gives me a reminder of why i love monks so much, its like an example of how you don't need the thickest, heaviest or shiniest armor or weapons, all you need in your inner awareness and strength of body and mind, and you can kick ass more then the heaviest weapon wielding jackhole.</div></div><hr />

This change allows it to function how it was intended. And if you want an Intercept style stun (3 seconds) you can spec into it! Personally, I still really love the mobility that Double Time provides. See, now that's good talent design. That's probably the only tier they got right with Warrior talents. I really hope they do a revamp.</div></div><hr />

Kirin Tor and Steamwheedle Cartel (6-Feb)<br />
Farstriders and Silver Hand (13-Feb)<br />
Cenarion Circle and Sisters of Elune (after 13-Feb)<br />
Feathermoon and Scarlet Crusade (after 13-Feb)<br />
<br />
So about no RP realm connections...looks like about half of the RP servers will be connected within a few weeks. I guess you must not be familiar with all the RP realms. Don't worry, yours will eventually be connected.</div></div><hr />

Iconic warrior ability; nice words when you simply want to say: i want to stay overpowered. Even now warrior is very strong: and you can complain when you were nerfed like shadow priests were.<br />
<br />
Also: if you want the stun, you can spec it.<br />
<br />
every class has had its ups and downs throughout this expansion. you might think its crazy, but 5.1-5.2 warriors were at the bottom of the barrel, and spriests were apart of the best 3s comp, best being god comp(mage,spriest,rdruid).<br />
<br />
im not defending warriors now, i just think its ridiculous to make a statement like that when most classes have seen some spotlight throughout the exp</div></div><hr />

I feel like you've never played warrior. Double time gives you 2 charges initially, but after you expend them, every single recharge for a single use is on a 20 second recast. As another poster mentioned, 5.1 and 5.2 were pretty bad for warriors, as was the entirety of cataclysm, but hey, let's just call classes we don't understand overpowered instead of learning how they work.<br />
<br />
For instance, Charge has a minimum range, and can easily be LOSed. Furthermore, what's the fourth interrupt? Shockwave? Stormbolt? Both of those have to be specced into, Stormbolt at the cost of losing Avatar or Bloodbath, Shockwave at the cost of losing Bladestorm or (lol) Dragon Roar. Also, the only TRUE interrupt that actually causes lockout for Warriors is pummel.<br />
<br />
Charging Paladins is gonna suck now, lol.<br />
<br />
Shadow Priests though, definitely need a buff. I'd say they are probably the weakest PVP class in the game right now. They have dispersion and that's it, not many defensive options (though if left to their devices, they can still do a ton of damage).</div></div><hr />

That way I could still use it to interrupt caster mobs in raids whereas in PVP it cannot be used to keep someone chain stunned.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">twiddler</div><div class="date">2014-02-02, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the only reason Charge stunned in the first place was so the mob would stay still while you ran to it. This change allows it to function how it was intended. And if you want an Intercept style stun (3 seconds) you can spec into it! Personally, I still really love the mobility that Double Time provides. See, now that's good talent design. That's probably the only tier they got right with Warrior talents. I really hope they do a revamp.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure charge stunned in the first place because, along with the knockdown animation, scientifically, momentum would induce such an occurrence. Hamstring rooting makes sense. You get popped in the leg and you find yourself immobilized as you react to such pain. Root from charge? Okay...</div></div><hr />

I hate those people with &quot;xy-realm&quot; name. I read the Critical WoW Insider webpage andthere is a graph, it's really funny how much work they do in the &quot;Ingame Shop&quot; instead of the content.<br />
FUN FACT: They will sell less new expasions than what they have ever made. ^^</div></div><hr />

A slightly alliance server with a heavy alliance server? Maybe they don't really look at that when it comes to PvE realms, but I don't see how this really fixes anything.</div></div><hr />

Celestalon's responses were already obvious to any Warlock with half a brain. Those who tweeted at him claiming the Imp is limited by time and not energy are bad and should feel bad.</div></div><hr />

Don't mean this to troll or anything but with allot of EU servers being dead i could see trying to RP being very hard when there is no one to RP with. Have most RPers not jumped ship and gave up in RPing? To little to late?<br />
<br />
people do, but mists was a bit of a killer in the rp department, nobody wants to rp all day with the theme of pandas, since it pulls away from themes of any other race.</div></div><hr />

It has compatibility issues with hardware and will freeze most likely during the &quot;windows is setting up your computer for first time use&quot; screen. To fix this you have to access the device manager in safe mode and disable devices. Look up exactly how to do it or note me and I'll explain in more detail.</div></div><hr />
