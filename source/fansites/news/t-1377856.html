Blizzard just trademarked &quot;Warlords of Draenor&quot; in New Zealand. It was then registered in Australia shortly after. <br />
<br />
<br />
Computer game software, computer game discs, downloadable computer game software, computer game software downloadable from a global computer network, interactive multimedia computer game program; downloadable electronic game software for use on portable electronic devices such as mobile and cellular phones, laptops, handheld computers, and tablet PCs.<br />

<br />
It's also worth mentioning that warlordsofdraenor.com (http://www.warlordsofdraenor.com) was registered a month ago. <br />
<br />
I do realize that we had a lot of fun times with trademarks in the past (*cough* Dark Below *cough*) but let's just say that on a personal level I'm pretty confident about this one. I'll leave the speculation up to you guys until Blizzcon. <br />

No it wasn't. Stop spreading misinformation like that. Heroes of the Storm was trademarked in New Zealand.. you know, the one that actually turned out to be true. The Dark Below was on the OHIM European trademark database.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raugnaut</div><div class="date">2013-11-01, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some things to say.<br />
<br />
Outlands is a VERY small portion of what Draenor used to be. If Draenor is similar to Azeroth, then the Outland is smaller then one of the various continents- and Draenor probably never experienced a sundering before the opening of the portals. So yea. The Outland is part of Draenor. The Outland is NOT all of Draenor. I think that we will most likely go to an unbroken part of the planet to do... various things. Mostly kill things and collect lewtz.</div></div><hr />

I mean, I'm not opposed to the idea of a Burning Legion expansion. It appeals to me almost as much as a(n) Azshara/N'zoth expansion, but that name is just.. agh -- awful. And if it is true, and the poster from the 'what's next' thread was right when it comes to the content (Time Travel + Evil Grom).. then -- god, that's silly. xD</div></div><hr />

Gul'Dan on the Lost Isles? Blackhand? Complete Draenor would grant excess to many regions and landscape and it's true that Turalyon's help could support us greatly, but I still do not buy it.<br />
Many people read the 'leak' and it would be easy to use it to start some confusion. Maybe it is Masterfooler creating the website, posting the hoax on MMO and trademarking it. It could also be done by Blizzard, to distract everyone a little more from the 'Dark Below'. <br />
I also thought we would have dealt with Murozond already.<br />
<br />

<br />
downloadable electronic game software for use on portable electronic devices such as mobile and cellular phones, laptops, handheld computers<br />
Well, it might be the first booster series for Hearthstone. It would be somehow great if Hearthstone releases themes in the chronological order of Warcraft. Then again, the described leak would not make any sense.<br />
Hmm okay, I guess it is either next WoW expansion or nothing =/</div></div><hr />

Not sure how it will work with the horde, since they cant really fight themselves :s Maybe different raids for alliance / horde? Horde raid : get to Kalimdor, Alliance raid, stop horde from getting into Kalimdor?<br />

P.S Please people, please, it is Outland, it has never been referred to OutlandS, The Outlands or any other name at any point ever in the game, print, advertising or anywhere ever.

P.P.S Hilarious at people judging the entirity of the next expansion and all its features off its name, it gives us a clue yes, but you literally cannot have an opinion until we actually know...something...about it.<br />

Well don't get ahead of yourself. The Title Warlords of Draenor (Draenor, not Outlands) mixed with how that one rumor thread mentioned it would be a time travel heavy expansion, means there's a very good chance it'll take place before the legion comes to Draenor, so it might not have anything or very little to do with the legion</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warstar</div><div class="date">2013-11-01, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well since Bliiz storylines love to play the good guy getting corrupted angle, my geuss is:<br />
<br />
Alleria &amp; Turalyon will have been corrupted by the Burning Legion, will lead the new invasion of Azeroth. We'll have to fight our old heroes... again.<br />
<br />
Or maybe Turalyon will play the role that Tiron did in wrath. Alleria &amp; Turalyon have been thrown around a lot from references to them in BC when everyone was pissed that all the old heroes were back except them to the tool tip later added saying &quot;No one has heard from Alleria &amp; Turalyon in quite some time&quot; or something like that.<br />
<br />
Personally I think/hope that they'll be here to aid us rather than be a bad guy. Turalyon is too much of a Bolvar type figure that if they make him bad/kill him off that people will throw a fit over that.<br />
<br />
As far as the whole time travel thing it seems more likely to be same time line just possibly Draenor being a stepping stone to the Burning Legion without them having to come to Azeroth. Really the Burning Legion has been built up so much by the whole Wrathion quest line that if it doesn't have a direct tie in it's going to be a horrible plot turn. It'd be like Blizzard writing a book about the history of Azeroth and then finishing with a narration of two unicorn's talking about what they want to have for dinner.</div></div><hr />

Same. This seems terrible, and I wasn't even negative about Mists of Pandaria when the trademark was found. Merely skeptical at first and accepting later on.

Argus is dead cuz the Burning Legion destroit it, thats why the Draenei had to flee from there.<br />
And u all should consider that world like Argus etc. are other planets, u cant just go there with magic, u have to know WHERE it is and only the ones who come from there know how to go there... Argus would be an option but in the present it is destroit and some kind of sub-base of the Burning Legion i think.<br />
Sargeras can go everywhere cuz he is a TITAN before he turned against Aman'thul &amp; co. And Kil'Jaeden as his right hand... it would make sense if he knows how this works. <br />
Xoroth... we know how 2 summon something from there but we dont know who this world exactly is.... ^^ without the Dark Portal we wouldnt know what Draenor is :&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
When the theory is in mess, Anduin Wrynn regrets his choice, while Wrathion faces his glory.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anduin uses the powers of the Timeless Isle with/without celestials and bronze dragonflight to &quot;create&quot; a parallel timeline with Draenor intact, or make a portal to the past before Draenor's destruction and sends Garrosh there to meet his father so Grom can bitchslap him (in the vision of time we get, Anduin actually visits Garrosh to offer him this).

Look at it more closely, it says &quot;Warlords OF Draenor&quot;. That could mean we are going to a different Burning Legion planet entirely, but it'd have something to do with warlords of Draenor. (Probably a reference to the Burning Legion).<br />

<br />
Lore is just a compilation of major historical events in a story. Nothing says it has to describe everything and every land in detail. Chances are it deals with outland as we know it, but perhaps in a different timeframe. But, just because something wasn't in lore doesn't mean it can't exist. Lore doesn't say much if anything about many of the other planets in this universe, but that doesn't mean there aren't any other planets out there.</div></div><hr />

I see a lot of people exclaiming frustration with potentially having to deal with the Legion again. You people DO realize that their return is inevitable, right?

And the WoD leak also states that &quot;The Dark Below&quot; was Titan. And if the leak was right about WoD then it is probably right about everything else.

I thought Outland was awesome, I thought Northrend was awesome, but I hated Cataclysm and I hated Pandaria. Why? Because after having checked Outland and Northrend off my list of places I want to go there is the South Seas. So for every expansion that hits that is not a South Seas expansion with Queen Azshara as the main villain I will remain disappointed. Once I get that expansion and can cross it off my list I can start being excited for other stuff. I wouldn't even be happy going to Argus (which should be really cool) if I don't get to see the South Seas first. Really hope this is not the name of the next WoW expansion.<br />
<br />
Although Outland/Draenor is really cool, much much cooler than Pandaria. So it should be exciting nonetheless, albeit disappointing. But what would really suck is if this time-travel talk going around is true. That would really suck. I hate time-travel shit. Like how they made those changes to the War of the Ancients. What. The. Fuck. Time-travel always ruins things, unless you do it like Star Trek did it by creating an entirely new timeline once you alter something in the past. But Warcraft is doing the sucky old version of time traveling so... I hope it isn't that.</div></div><hr />

It's a whole separate world from Azeroth - which I'm growing really sick of after the last 3 expansions. I know Pandaria feels different; but it's still Azeroth and the story still plays out in Orgrimmar.</div></div><hr />

Probably he means dark below and corgis unleashed. He might as well haven't believed in reaper of souls nor heroes of storm before we knew its official and thought of including them as a &quot;couple of last expansions&quot;<br />
<br />
OT; Sounds cool. I hope they don't remake zangarmarsh though if we go through outland again, always hated that place ever since it was made. The concept of time travel seems not bad as well might be one of the best xpacs to date if they don't let people's hope down and mess it up. But why have 2 horde antagonist within 2 expansions? Why not introduce a badass hero or something? But I guess the way they could portray him might turn out well and I hope they dont &quot;force&quot; people to have grom like they did with garrosh.</div></div><hr />

edit: Okay, going out on a limb here, but... yea, let's assume the guy is right... and the guy was mentioning the Caverns of Time...

Firstly - while this looks legit, TDB looked legit for me until about less than an hour ago. So I'll reserve full judgment at least until the trademark is approved.<br />
<br />
Secondly, regarding the potential time travel: There are two big problems here (providing we're going back in time to change something, rather than to fix it.). The first is that it makes the Horde questing experience difficult. The second is that if say we stop the Horde before arriving on Azeroth, it will involve pretty much rewriting the entirety of the story after Warcraft II. <br />
<br />
It's possible that the story can be manipulated in such a way that history is changed, but not too drastically. For example the Legion's attempts at corrupting the Orcish Clans could be thwarted, meaning in the present Draenor is still intact and Alleria and Turalyon aren't lost etc. But at the same time the Dark Portal or some approximation could be opened, and the Horde could invade Azeroth, just not under demonic influence. <br />
<br />
I have to say, aside from the generic tingles of expansion excitement, I'm not really feeling this one too much. It will involve a lot of Horde and more specifically Orc lore, after far too much of this already. Blizzard will also need to go through some major narrative gymnastics in order to make sure any time travel isn't too detrimental.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gheld</div><div class="date">2013-11-01, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So it possible that we could see Draenor before it shit struck the fan? And that means, can we expect the same treatment for Azeroth in the next expansion after that (Emerald Dream)?<br />
<br />
That's what I would expect from the title and the composite of all the &quot;leaks&quot; that seem to connect to this. <br />
<br />
My guess would be that Wrathion (whose end game is to raise a 1 world army to take on the Burning Legion, presumably) not entirely satisfied with his work on Azeroth tricks Anduin into freeing Garrosh, so that he can go back in time and have that relationship with Dad he always dreamed of. And Garrosh and Wrathion, disappointed by the pacifistic nature of the pre-legion orcs (because before that time they just hung out and picked flowers with the Draenei all day) make Warlords of their tribal leaders so that they are prepared for the legion invasion that we future folk know will happen. <br />
<br />
And of course the moment when the new Horde was born, was when Grom sacrificed himself to free the Orcs from their Legion created bloodlust. So simply by saving Grom he becomes an antagonist becuase he has to die along with Mannoroth in order for history to play out the way it's supposed to.<br />
<br />
EDIT: It's quite possible the storyline could actually have us trying to assist the Legion in enslaving the Orcs and eventually destroying Draenor.</div></div><hr />

And u all should consider that world like Argus etc. are other planets, u cant just go there with magic, u have to know WHERE it is and only the ones who come from there know how to go there... Argus would be an option but in the present it is destroit and some kind of sub-base of the Burning Legion i think.<br />
Sargeras can go everywhere cuz he is a TITAN before he turned against Aman'thul &amp; co. And Kil'Jaeden as his right hand... it would make sense if he knows how this works. <br />
Xoroth... we know how 2 summon something from there but we dont know who this world exactly is.... ^^ without the Dark Portal we wouldnt know what Draenor is :&gt;<br />
<br />
Yup, I quite agree with you :) But we actually don't now is Argus fully destroyed, or is it surface just dead. Also im actually more willing to accept the Draenei ships as way to get into other worlds, more than using portal into there - which, as we know, require a lot of power, and dark magic - only Medivh created a stable Portal Azeroth - Draenor, Ner'zhul only was able created unstable Dimersional Gateways into random places, which destroyed Draenor. Portals are dangerous, but Naaru Twisting Nether Ships are not :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
One whole expac with 3-4 patches on Bronze Dragonflight? Are you kidding me? Grom is dead. Had enough of Orcs. 1 raid or a dungeon on it should be fine<br />
Biggest question is why? Bronze dragonflight are weaker than before. <br />
<br />
I‘d say its a book. Was Wotlk trade marked 2 weeks before Blizzcon? or Cata?<br />
<br />
Draenor is blown up sometime after the end of WC2 expansion and before WC3. Although the popular opinion seems to be that it was right at the end of WC2 expansion while we were watching the credits roll. <br />
<br />
But Grom Hellscream was alive for some undetermined period of time BEFORE Draenor goes kaboom.</div></div><hr />

The upcoming expansion is called Warlords of Draenor and will feature Grom as the antagonist, although for legal issues he will be refered to as Grommash. This expansion will see the heavy use of time travel.<br />

There was some soundfile called &quot;Timewalkers&quot; if I remember, plus the whole questline about the timelines and the Bronze Dragonflight, plus the Timeless Isle appearing from no where all of a sudden.<br />
The fact that it was mentioned that this will feature Time Travel just really really makes me think this is it.<br />
<br />
About the Demon Hunter thing though, Ghostcrawler said he wanted Illidan back in the past (sometime in Cata); considering how Time Travel is said to be featured in this, it is more than likely he could easily make an appearance and bring Demon Hunters to the table. Especially if it'll be about Draenor and the Burning Legion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's probably not a retcon, but an odd twist on the &quot;future&quot; lore. So, while we technically &quot;go to the past&quot; we're still going forward with the story along a different path.<br />
<br />
Assuming it is in fact a time travel ordeal. The characters (ours and the major influential figures) needed to go through the experiences of the timeline they are currently on (defeating Garrosh and meeting the Pandaren), because these events influence the decisions needed to be made on the TRUE timeline (the one the infinite dragon flight were trying to protect, or nozzy worked to protect realizing we would have to go there eventually).<br />
<br />
Could be that this timeline our characters were in was some sort of chaotic nightmare brought about by the old gods, and Garrosh found this out, so something brought him to flee to this &quot;past&quot; with us in tail.</div></div><hr />

A good story takes time to develop, and there are a lot of things to be done before fighting the big bad titan himself. No way an end to the legion would take just one expansion, there's plenty to make a couple of them at the least. We still need to deal with the full might of Kil'Jaeden, rather than just his torso hanging through a portal. We still have azshara to deal with, and possibly even Sargeras' avatar. Those are good potential for 2 full expansions in their own right. We do have to build the &quot;army of light&quot; to be lead by anduin, and join with the naruu and the rest. THEN we have to learn more about the extent of the titans powers and better understand Sargeras in order to properly fight and defeat him. Like I said, lots to do before he comes out to play.</div></div><hr />

If there was none in an expansion possibly entirely focused on Draenor, I'd have to think of some action worse than flipping tables...</div></div><hr />

I would adore seeing the Black Temple in its original state if we do indeed go back in time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye,it kind of sounds awkward and unusual for WoW.<br />
....but so did Mists of Pandaria.Before it was confirmed to be an expansion,I thought it was WarCraft IV.Seriously. :P</div></div><hr />

Christ the last thing I want to see is a rehash of the worst WoW experience I ever endured. BC was a damn snorefest. Again? we haven't had a demon based xpac since BC so its not like they flood us with demons. Also i very much enjoy Legion lore so just assuming its Legion based ( not even sure that would be the case mind you) doesn't mean magically blizzard will roll all their ways of doing things back to BC.</div></div><hr />

That'd be too much of a repeat of Garrosh. No doubt he'll play a central role, but the main villain again? I actually think they might be trying the whole &quot;no main villain&quot; thing they were going for in MOP. Just building new lore and characters, with each patch being it's own sidestory. <br />
<br />
It could work in theory - but for the 10th anniversary it's a risk. People are expecting something big.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">End Game</div><div class="date">2013-11-01, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont buy this. First of all nozdormu gave up his powers which means no way of going back in time second of all if we go back in time we would screw up all the progress we have made deathwing would have destroyed the world ragnaros would be trying to burn our world no orcs would have made it to azeroth which means no lich king and the old gods would be free to roam the world now I am not saying that screwing the timelines up is a bad thing if u are alliance than that means a shit tone of loot but horde well it wouldnt of been formed without thrall soo that means the alliance gets bigger. <br />
Also a new race, bronze dragonflight would be cool but it still sounds very unlikely I am more convinced at it being a future time travel but then again I am not even sure if nozdormus dragonflight has the capabilitys of time travel over diffrent worlds I thought that he only had power in azeroth</div></div><hr />

I hate the burning legion, while I had fun in tbc I hated everything lore based around it with Illidan being an exception. I hope that stays away.</div></div><hr />
