I would say more than likely something to do with the void or maybe even an old god making the &quot;wound&quot;. Mayby the titan that's suppose to be Azeroth that Muradin has been talking to is really an old god and will burst forth out of Silithus.</div></div><hr />

This is a .2 patch, and not .5, and Lore himself said that this patch will contain almost no new playable content. I expect to see a break in the 77 days schedule.</div></div><hr />

He doesn't deserve it. Regardless if his plan worked, he still took a massive risk and one that seems to have endangered the planet anyways, Regardless is sargearas is locked away. I don't care how much they try to make him seem good, Illidan won't be good. I hated the retcons with his character.</div></div><hr />

But going off the map, it might be taking place is the past after the sundering. The Isle of Dread where you kill Lord Lakmaeran back in Vanilla WoW is risen off the north-west coast. Water is also visible off the south-east section of Silithus, meaning Uldum's cloaking shield is still active lore-wise. It would seem pretty odd that they dig up old vanilla map files and terrain to do something new for a 7.3 micro-patch.</div></div><hr />

See you in 8.0. Yep, wondering if vengeance demon hunter is gonna follow the fate of windwalker monk, 3 expansions since they were implemented and Blizzard still fails to invent what are they supposed to be good at and where to shine, so they end up being a discarded spec with some 5 mins of glory somewhere (like ww on twin ogron and veng dh when spirit bomb was broken op before 3 nerfs). <br />
<br />
I have some fun playing my DH alt but it feels like the spec suffers from lack of vision. Also being pigeon holed into fracture + spirit bomb means you're never using soul cleave making my legendary bracers and tos 4set completely useless. I really hope for some rework if not for Antorus, then at least for the next expansion. I expected more from the flagship class of Legion. I guess most dev's focus went into Havoc but still, the class has only 2 specs, you'd expect some effort...</div></div><hr />

<br />
TLDR version - <br />
Old golds &quot;work&quot; with the void lords. <br />
Old gods have been around for as long as the titans.<br />
Titans try to order the universe away from chaos. <br />
Sargeras wants to destroy the universe to save it from the darkness of the void lords.<br />
Void lords are like gods, the dungeon versions aren't &quot;void lord&quot; in the way the godlike void lords are. <br />
Void lords are way stronger than old gods.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend reading the Warcraft Chronicle archives if you want a deep sense. <br />

<br />
The potentially-confusing thing is that there are actually two separate entities in WoW: Voidlords and Void Lords, and one is significantly more powerful than the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I found that out when I had two toons on that side of the continent. The wound caused so much damage it killed the entire realm on that side.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JohnnyMccrum</div><div class="date">2017-09-21, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So based on the VO's , we lose the battle in Silithus against the wound Sargeras himself created no matter what we do, even when aided by the titans themselves, we still lose, with this information we can assume Azeroth (or, at least southern Kalimdor) is lost, or that the entirety of the next expansion will be on Azeroth allied with the titans fighting against this wound.<br />
<br />
And the next patches will likely be using the titans help to find and destroy Sargeras. <br />
<br />
Also likely we'll be fighting with the elemental lords, and others like Bolvar, combined Horde/alliance.<br />
<br />
based on actual posts, Kalimdor is fucking destroyed, so for the first time ever, Undercity might get a few refugees (or even stormwind) <br />
<br />
So this is the &quot;beginning of the end&quot; expansion pack.<br />

Whats the difference between old gods and void lords? Who is stronger? Pandemonius in mana tombs was supposed to be a void lord but was just a dungeon boss yet i read people say void lords are very powerful like old gods etc.. i am confused..<br />
<br />
<br />
Old gods were in the void, Titans created planets like azeroth as prisons to contain old gods, the old gods like Yogg'saron eventually broke free from their titan-created prisons. They predate Azeroth by a matter of eons. <br />
<br />
Void Lords have control of the void and the twisting nether, which is a plain full of infinite dead things, the void contains every single dead demon in existence, it's where dreadlords go when they &quot;die&quot;.</div></div><hr />

???? I mean i guess thats true but completely pointless. Literally nothing he said is true.<br />
<br />
We imprison sargeras in the raid so of course we arent fighting him after. This is just set up for the new well of eternity resurrecting old gods or attracting aliens</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, i literally took from the VO's (facts) and the fact we have titan involvement on mainland Azeroth, and the fact there are no recorded victory lines, which means this is a permanent change to Azeroths surface that even the titans cannot initially prevent or stop. (fact)<br />
<br />
For the longest time ever, I'm pretty certain that everyone (except you, blatantly) has always seen Sargeras as the main antagonist of WoW, and that if we ever fought with the Titans it would be the &quot;beginning of the end&quot;. You really can't argue against that. <br />
<br />
Now will Blizzard put in a massive grind and huge buildup to the finale feeding us shreds of new lore piece-meal every few months? and exhaust every possible shred of lore they can find before releasing the Sargeras raid? of course they will, it's Blizzard. <br />
<br />
I mean, you can't just perpetually get closer to Sargeras, and then not fight Sargeras and he somehow escapes for five expansions, I think we had quite enough of that with Gul'dan already, at some point in the next 2 expansions we will fight against and destroy Sargeras, and if we don't, then I don't know what Blizzard plans to do instead of it, maybe we'll just go to Catandia instead and meet a new race of long lost cat people and deal with their problems whilst that scar gets bigger.<br />
<br />
You're undoubtedly reaching at straws to suggest that Titan involvement on Azeroth isn't bringing the game to what millions of players have foreseen for the longest time as the &quot;ending&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
So as a last act of defiance, Sargeras teabags Azeroth. And Silithus of all places.<br />
<br />
Yeah, because there's loads of people there. &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
C'thun is there, well his corpse, and even if it isn't it will be so Blizzard can resurrect it with the &quot;powerful new corrupted energy sargeras provided&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well my theory is this...<br />
<br />
Azeroth's soul is comprised of most of the world's Spirit element, as stated in the Warcraft Chronicles Vol 1 book (which is why the Azerothian elements have no chill, like Ragnaros). It could be safe to say that, from this wound, all of this life-giving energy is spilling out, which could reach Ahn'Qiraj and the Silithid below. This could lead to them evolving, in a similar manner to how the Dark Trolls evolved into Night Elves, and how the Murlocs evolved into the Jinyu. The Silithid and Quiraji could very well evolve and, which the healing and revitalization properties of Spirit, could very well revive C'thun. <br />
<br />
But this is speculation, in any case.</div></div><hr />

Definitely a cool theory, would actually like to see this.<br />

Where is the C'thun redemption story though?</div></div><hr />

Regardless if his plan worked, he still took a massive risk and one that seems to have endangered the planet anyways, Regardless is sargearas is locked away. I don't care how much they try to make him seem good, Illidan won't be good. I hated the retcons with his character.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, it's not like Illidan jailed the God that was just about to cleave our World.<br />
<br />
It's not like Illidan apologized to Malfurion/Tyrande for not completely telling them his plans for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
It's not like we've DIED To Argus the Unmaker.<br />
<br />
It's not like we saved Azeroth from the Legion.<br />
<br />
It's also not like we're gonna try and stop the Void next Expac.<br />
<br />
Can't they at least say &quot;thank you&quot;, while we've been slaying Xavius, as well as their &quot;Corrupted Emerald Dragon&quot;? We've saved the Forests, Illidan and I defeated Kil'jaeden, and we saved the UNIVERSE From certain doom. Sure, the Void's out. But, hey, NEW CONTENT!</div></div><hr />

Considering how the next part of his audio is him talking about how &quot;Time answers&quot; to him, I'm guessing it's part of the fight, we die, he rewinds time for a second chance.</div></div><hr />

Cool indeed but for me I would prefer something like that:<br />
<br />
We finally defeat Argus the unmaker then Sargeras showed up and we have no hope on defeating him and his boss encounter will be similar to the Lich king in Halls of Reflection where we just have to run away and survive the obstacles until the titans + Illidan finally seals Sargeras.</div></div><hr />

It's a Lich King 2.0<br />
<br />
Reap soul: Argus instantly kills off the Players. Were it not for the Titans, all hope would be lost....<br />

<br />
Well, let's be honest, we're not going to do much on Sargeras' Prison. We'll just defeat Argus, gain the Titan Pantheon's utimate Blessing, use little of our Artifact's power on Sargeras' Prison, then leave after Illidan says his goodbyes.</div></div><hr />

It was gradual. He lost his mind. This was a full stop complete change. IT TURNS OUT HE WAS GOOD ALL ALONG!!!<br />

Listen, Illidan doesn't deserve a Thank You for the shit he did. He still tortured and killed moonguard because he enjoyed the power. He was an evil psycho before they asspulled the whole storyline with him. I hate how they wrote him this expac, wish he would have stayed dead.</div></div><hr />

Looks like Sargeras did what everyone World of Warcraft player has wanted to do since World of Warcraft first began. (It's just a shame that we clearly interrupted him before he could finish.)</div></div><hr />
