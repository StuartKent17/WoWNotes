Why is it rushed? About the same time frame as the last two expansions<br />
<br />
Cata: 7th of dec<br />
FL: 28th June<br />

Mop: 25th of Sept<br />
ToT: 5th of March<br />
<br />
WoD: 14th of Nov<br />
HC: 23rd of June<br />
<br />
So pretty much around 7 month.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What he means is that he feels this patch is rushed in order to compete with the release of an expansion for a &quot;rival&quot; game. Blizzard has been moving around patch/release dates to counter their &quot;rival&quot; games since well before Final Fantasy XIV was around. Patches have coincided with XIV, GW2, Tera, and Warhammer patch or game releases for years. This is just yet another case of Blizzard valuing &quot;trying to counter program&quot; rather than completing testing/developing a patch.</div></div><hr />

They never plan around their competitors release dates, never ever, they said so when they released what ever it was the same time Wildstar dropped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, as much as I Hate continuing to raid BRF, 6.2 has crap for content outside of the raid. Its obvious they are rushing it. They have had so much time to work on this patch, yet there is nothing compared to other patches. Shame. They are probably just trying to salvage what ever they can for the Q2 reports at this point.<br />

Both Cata and MoP had content released between launch and the release of the raids listed. Both of them had content released afterwards as well, I can't say that I'm confident this will happen with WoD, unless a couple of interns are bored one weekend. :p</div></div><hr />

Haha for sure I am Mr. Troll....<br />
<br />
Watch ToT or SoO Trailer and then watch this...<br />
You know they are better compared to this...<br />
Heck after the SoO Trailer I wanted to wipe the floor with Garrosh for his arogance<br />
But this? Not to excited about the trailer (still excited for Mannoroth and Archimonde - but not cause of this trailer)</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've really gone out of their way to hide most things from him, aside from testing.<br />
<br />
All of the audio files that have been datamined were completely silent, they've shown no sign of him in &quot;official&quot; releases and I think even voices during the fight weren't complete.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling we're going to get a really, really cool cinematic after Mannoroth is defeated and then some cool shit will happen.<br />
<br />
And yes, it is STILL TROY BAKER. <br />

Because they probably still do play wow, but think it's cool to pretend to be on the &quot;I've unsubbed&quot; train.

I don't get it either...if they're so confident in their new game (since ya know, can't enjoy more than one mmorpg/console/genre of movies at a time!!) why are they getting their trousers in a bunch about new content for the game they're so &quot;over&quot;...?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keymil</div><div class="date">2015-06-17, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something that bothers me a little... It's pretty clear they had no idea what to do with 6.2 cinematic and I'll tell you why:<br />
Cinematics:<br />
Wotlk last patch: lore heavy, no features showed.<br />
Cata last patch: let's not even comment on that.<br />
MoP last patch: lore heavy, no features showed.<br />
WoD: light on lore, has features (lol) in it.<br />
<br />
See the pattern? Wotlk and MoP patches had lore cinematics introducing us into further developed story. They didn't need any feature-promotion, cause the story in them was good and they focused wholly on that.<br />
And then we have WoD last patch cinematic: the whole thing was just... cringeworthy? Grom and Gul'dan somewhere, alone... looking at Iron Citadel, Grom licking our asses then Gul'dan throwing green magma at the building... What's the story there? What's the lore? What is it that we learned from this cinematic? Nothing. It might as well just not be there.<br />
<br />
And that Gul'dan voice... don't know what they did, but it sounded so... weird? Earlier Gul'dan sounded badass, but in this cinematic he sounded way off.<br />
<br />
I'm disappoint. Wotlk and MoP cinematics left me shaking from excitement. This one made me frown upon it.</div></div><hr />

The voice-acting.<br />
Nothing particularly quotable.<br />
Gul'dan conjures fel soup that brings up spikes. SPIKES, I TELL YOU!<br />
More orcs.<br />
Garrison shipyard... Yeah, that's something to really look forward to. /sarcasm<br />
Tanaan Jungle overview lasts 4 seconds.<br />
While we do see some raid bosses, we don't get even a 0.5 second glance of the final boss (not even a name drop). Heck, even Kil'jaeden from Patch 2.4 got to have his hand shown. Speaking of 2.4...<br />
&quot;Fury of Hellfire&quot;. For its vocabulary composition, it doesn't really inspire. But I'll throw a bone to Blizzard -- at least it's not &quot;The Patch with No Name&quot;.<br />
<br />
Why the surprise, though. It's an underwhelming patch cinematic fit for an underwhelming expansion.</div></div><hr />

He's not sure, he's just talking shit to his new main enemy.

Same actor, blizzard confirmed this in multiple locations. <br />
<br />
Also, people complain about the lack of content, and when they release content, they complain that it's been rushed without even logging in... <br />

Doesn't matter that it's the same actor, it's being done differently is the point. It's a minor complaint, though - hopefully he's back to rasping menacingly at us in the Hellfire Citadel encounters.</div></div><hr />

Cinematics:<br />
Wotlk last patch: lore heavy, no features showed.<br />
Cata last patch: let's not even comment on that.<br />
MoP last patch: lore heavy, no features showed.<br />
WoD: light on lore, has features (lol) in it.<br />
<br />
See the pattern? Wotlk and MoP patches had lore cinematics introducing us into further developed story. They didn't need any feature-promotion, cause the story in them was good and they focused wholly on that.<br />
And then we have WoD last patch cinematic: the whole thing was just... cringeworthy? Grom and Gul'dan somewhere, alone... looking at Iron Citadel, Grom licking our asses then Gul'dan throwing green magma at the building... What's the story there? What's the lore? What is it that we learned from this cinematic? Nothing. It might as well just not be there.<br />
<br />
And that Gul'dan voice... don't know what they did, but it sounded so... weird? Earlier Gul'dan sounded badass, but in this cinematic he sounded way off.<br />
<br />
I'm disappoint. Wotlk and MoP cinematics left me shaking from excitement. This one made me frown upon it.<br />
<br />
Last patch cinematic ? this IS NOT the end content patch why do people keep saying that ? lol this is 6.2 that would be like saying ulduar was the last patch in LK they already confirmed that grom would be the last boss of THIS xpac.........<br />

They didnt confirm shit. They said that Grommash would be the main villian of WoD back at BlizzCon 2013, but this never meant that he is also the endboss of this expansion. Let alone that 80% of BlizzCon information are just PR lies, or that their plans changed since than (almost 2 years ago).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm excited for patch 6.2, gonna bunker up on stuff I only treat myself to when there's something &quot;big&quot; happening (and new content for this expansion sure as hell falls under that category) and clear my schedule/kill my phone for it!<br />
<br />
I think you're mistaking bemusement and poking fun at Blizzard for &quot;getting their trousers in a bunch.&quot; Honestly, given how frequently Blizzard's stuff has come out incredibly close to stuff from other games, they deserve to be made fun of for it.<br />
<br />
It's practically parody at this point - big event for another major MMO in the western market, WoW is going to do something, whether it's an announcement or a release of some kind.<br />

I can promise you that those of us in the FFXIV camp aren't bothered by this...it's good comedy.<br />

That answer would be equally applicable if you substitute patch 6.2 for patch 2.4, 3.3, 4.3 or 5.4. They have plenty more story but none of it is in WoD.</div></div><hr />

Probably because its still rare, and they want it to still be rewarding after diminishing returns. <br />

Cause from my googlefu, all I'm getting is speculation based on what was said about a potential 1 year - 2 tier expansion cycles with no reference to WoD being one.

That might change, but I've been playing XIV for longer than a &quot;few weeks&quot; now, so we'll see(around april of 2014 was when I started and haven't unsubbed since). Even if I get bored with it, I'm more likely to play non mmo games than go back to WoW. But yeah, sorry, if you think that it being literally the exact same release date as the expansion for another sub based mmo is a coincidence, not sure what to say.

umm...did you even watch the end? and im already excited, i don't need a trailer to get me excited. I also happen to really like when they show more in game stuff in the trailers instead of all cgi nonsense.<br />
I didn't see it as were rescuing him i saw it as were going into destroy someone who is obviously crazy and working for the legion...hence the very end of the cinematic<br />

Oh look something Blizzard have done since like tbc/wrath times. Releasing content to compete with other games. Please come back with a better argument.</div></div><hr />

&quot;OMG PEOPLE WILL LEAVE FF'S NEW EXPANSION FOR 6.2!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I think people is just saying that is pretty obvious what is the reason for launch the patch the same day than FF14 Heavensward Release<br />
plus, June 30 is the last day of this second quarter, so it's pretty obvious that too.</div></div><hr />

I also happen to really like when they show more in game stuff in the trailers instead of all cgi nonsense.<br />
I didn't see it as were rescuing him i saw it as were going into destroy someone who is obviously crazy and working for the legion...hence the very end of the cinematic<br />
<br />
Yes, I watched the ending. Are you talking about when Gul'dan randomly says &quot;everyone serves the Legion&quot; or whatever? That was crap. It doesn't make sense even. The Legion is not trying to convert the Azeroth forces, they are trying to kill us. If they were going to raise us from the dead like Arthas then it'd make sense.<br />
<br />
This cinematic would have been about 200 million percent better if he were talking with Archimonde or Sargeras, being conniving. Instead we get Gul'dan chatting it up with Grom who went from main boss to a nobody in chains. Neutered the expansion.</div></div><hr />

So basically you don't appreciate that since the opening cinematic for WoD their positions are now reversed.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure anyone that would play FFXIV will continue to, and anyone that would play WoW would continue to regardless of the dates it was released.<br />

I don't know ask them why they always plan patches for game releases. Only one who really cares would be people on the forums and Blizz i can't tell you right now the developers on FFXIV could give 2 shits about it they're not trying to surpass wow</div></div><hr />

<br />
And im sure the 7million people that play WoW only 10% of them would even know there is a FFXIV expac the same day.<br />
<br />
So why would either side care either way? Just seems pathetic all these people posting &quot;LOOK AT THE DATE OMFG FFXIV USCAREDBLIZZ.&quot;<br />

If Anything releasing a Patch on the same day as an ENTIRE expansion is more Ballsy, since if they bring people away from FFXIV then they have already won.</div></div><hr />

True - I jumped over to FF14 and I don't see myself going back to WoW anytime soon (though to be clear, my sub is active until Jan '16 thanks to tokens.) Honestly, I hope most WoW players DON'T try FF14 - the community is amazing and I would rather not see it not ruined in short order.</div></div><hr />

No, it's about group finder, that thing where you can find premade groups of people for quests, raids, dungeons etc. You can now choose to find people from different language realms. LFG/LFR is not affected.</div></div><hr />

Wow, talk about picking low-hanging fruit. <br />
<br />
If 3 of those 4 games are launches, then they have no playerbase, it is all potential players, and you are delusional if you think Blizzard doesn't release at the same time to try and hold as many people as they can to what they are familiar with instead of trying something new.

It runs as if it is slighty less on speed now, they have reduced the speed at which the legs move. Which is a shame because it was hilarious to run around on a boar mount and watch their tiny legs move faster than they should ever be able to.</div></div><hr />

Is because they used the Direhorn as base model instead the boars from Vanilla. Same for the Riverbeast.<br />

I agree but we've come to a time where everything gets criticised as a doomsday sign. People are even picking up on the fact they started listing new features in trailers. What if they just want to make a summary of what will be there? Nooo, of course, they're just desperate...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I mean you don't get to grind tomes of soldery(justice points) and mythology(valour), in wow(anymore)! Ha! We have so much more content over here. <br />
<br />
Look, I enjoyed levelling in FF14, but lets not act like it's got more content than WoD at max level realistically. A LOT of the starter max level content is just recycled from the leveling experience.

To all you haters being all &quot;omg, they released it the same day as FFsomethingnumber&quot;, who cares? I didn't even know the game existed before I read it here in this thread. And I bet A LOT of other WoW players share that, never seen any commercials for it or anything. Atleast Blizzard knows how to reach out.<br />
And it isn't something new that games get released on the same day, it haven't mattered before, and it wont now. <br />
<br />
So take your Final Fantasy stuff, pack your bags and go to some forum that cares about it. Because most of us here dont.</div></div><hr />

Yeah.... about that... this is a WoW post and I didn't want to bite the bait and I m not one of those who bashes WoW while playing XIV but I have to call on complete and utter BS about the &quot;you have the same stuff as WoD to do on end game&quot;. The reason I quit WoW was because of WoD and what drew me into FFXIV was the insane amount of content the game offered for late game. I ve been playing the game for about 6 months and have barely even set foot in the main damn raid instance and have sooo much stuff to do absolutely non related to achievements. The grind you mentioned is there but thats a given for any mmo. Its whats available to you OTHER than the currency farm that makes it count. Wether you want to do it or not or wether you liked the other stuff or not is up to you but you cant say its not there or that there is no incentive to do them. Triple triad, chocobo tending, raising and racing, housing plots, crafting and star crafting, hunts, beast tribe reputations etc etc are just things that first came to mind and are all relevant content outside of raidding with their own niche, fun or story tied to them.<br />
Again I am not bashing WoW so current WoW players dont jump on me in anger. I was once a WoW player like you and I truly hope the game keeps being successful as I am too emotionaly tiedd to it despite not playing it anymore.<br />
The reasoning behind this post is because I felt the game I am currently on needed some justice on a field where it shines. If you were to bash other stuff that actually present problems to the game I d fully aknowledge that. But late game activities is a very strong point for FFXIV.<br />
<br />
On topic, I still thought the patch trailer was kind of horrible and uninteresting :/ Heres to hoping they do something better for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

You seem to pull out their 'confirmations' that work in your favour, and ignore the ones that do not.<br />
There are many things pointing to this patch being the last one. I wont even list them cause it's been talked to death.<br />
<br />
Oh and they also confirmed that garrisons would be moveable and customized. And the world would be savage. And that it had so much content. And...<br />

I highlighted the part I wanted to address since that's what stood out to me.<br />
<br />
FFXIV's hard mode dungeons are not just scaled versions of the normal mode leveling dungeons. For example, Haukke Manor normal (a leveling dungeon) takes one path, and has another blocked off. Haukke Manor hard (level cap dungeon) takes that previously blocked path, and has different mobs/bosses/mechanics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm confused.<br />
I'm guessing that the way they'll have nerfed the gold output from the treasure missions is by either flagging all of them as account-wide, so you can only complete one of each across all your characters, and/or reducing the base amount rewarded. That is a significant nerf, so I think the increase to the Blingtron's mission reward is to partially offset the loss.</div></div><hr />
