Patch 4.0.6 Patch Notes (PTR)<br />
Official patch notes have been released and seems to be from a build older than the one on PTR. Also, official changes are always better than datamined changes so there you go!<br />
General<br />
<br />
Many tooltips have been updated to reflect any changes made via recent hotfixes.<br />
The guild reward Armadillo Pup now requires revered faction instead of exalted.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP <br />
Arenas<br />
<br />
Bloodlust, Heroism, Time Warp and Ancient Hysteria can no longer be cast while in Arenas.<br />
<br />

<br />
The damage done by Antipersonnel Cannons has been doubled.<br />
The missile speed of Rocket Blast (Antipersonnel Cannons) has been increased by roughly 50%.<br />
Some Antipersonnel Cannons could shoot the platform they were spawned on. These spawn locations have been fixed.<br />
The Battleground Demolisher no longer has two additional seats and now only has room for the driver.<br />
A PvP duration flag has been added to Battleground Demolishers. This should make it so crowd control effects cast on unmanned demolishers does not last an extended amount of time.<br />
There should no longer be a discrepancy in time when the Battleground Demolishers spawn at the start of each round.<br />
The Battleground Demolishers spawned on the docks no longer despawn when the north graveyard is taken by the offense.<br />

Dunno.<br />
<br />
For Bear, it's really not important (and if the armor buff is not a tooltip fix, then it is a buff). Sure, your damage got nerfed, but who really cares about that? Blizzard's Vengeance mechanic throws like 105810581 AP at you, you could practically auto-attack for threat. Almost all progression tanks are already avoiding hit and expertise like the plague for that reason. Ferals were already the highest DPS tank on every fight besides Magmaw according to WoL.<br />
<br />
For Cats, it's probably a dps decrease, but likely nothing incredibly massive. I imagine they'll adjust for it in a later PTR patch as there is still a lot of stuff missing in this one (Chaotic meta gem fix plox).<br />
<br />
Edited to adjust for the new patch notes and comments made towards this post.</div></div><hr />

I think you missed the &quot;IMPORTANT - Due to the countless hotfixes sinces the deployment of Patch 4.0.3a on live servers, a lot of these changes are most likely tooltip &quot;fixes&quot; from past changes and could already be live&quot; on Bibi's post.<br />
<br />
Most of the stuff that is in his findings and not in these findings are just tooltip fixes for older stuff.<br />
<br />
Also, apparently at least one of them wasn't true at all - the Raging Blow nerf isn't real, it was a change to the level 39 version of the spell, not level 85: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1764415027?page=1#16</div></div><hr />

Bloodlust, Heroism, Time Warp and Ancient Hysteria can no longer be cast while in Arenas.<br />
<br />
This is how you fix mage's damage apparently.<br />
<br />
Has nothing to do with Mage damage. Mage &quot;damage&quot; isn't a problem. Mage control is. If you limit the ways a Mage can freeze you (which all our control mechanisms tie into. Slows proc FoF, and freezes well, freeze), you're going to limit their damage output. Ice Lance is only strong because we have far too many ways to get frozen Ice Lances on you.<br />
<br />
Though I will laugh at the RoF nerf, aside from not being able to Cold Snap it, it really didn't get hit that hard. Hopefully the 4y circumference difference will give people a chance to get out of it. Even as a Mage, I thought it was silly that anyone in the middle had zero chance to escape.<br />
<br />
I imagine we'll see some more control nerfs, hopefully alongside some Fire PvE buffs.</div></div><hr />

Shadow Priests are one of the higher-end hybrid DPS right now. I'm not sure exactly what you want changed with them besides Mind Sear. Any more damage and they'll be OP.<br />
<br />
BM Hunters needed a bigger buff than they got probably, yeah.<br />

These warrior changes are god awful. I'm sure the people complaining about warriors are the ones rolling around in 1500 resil or less. which yes you will get shit on. But when I go up against people in 3300+ I can definately tell that I dont put out shit for damage. With all these nerfs coming Warriors are now a joke.

<br />
Those have got to be a direct result of someone with zero resilience getting hit by a Fury warrior. <br />
<br />
I know blizzarrd said they were going to nerf heroic strike to make sure we just use it the rage dump it is designed to be, but the the raging blow and cleave nerfs? <br />
<br />
Come on, that has to be because some PVP scrub QQed too much. I don't see anything complaining Raging blow hits too hard in PVE.</div></div><hr />

Already battling for last spot with rets. Rets get a massive buff, warriors get nerfed even more. This patch makes no sense. I stopped PVPing in S4, so personally I couldn't care less about it. But unfortunately there is still a fair number of ppl that do, so if there is an issue with warriors in pvp, maybe just maybe it's got to do with an uncesseary stun given to arms spec? An intelligent person would look to revert the most significant changes introduced to a class when a supposed unbalancing problem is detected. However, that would be admitting they were wrong to even add it in, so the alternate solution is to screw up all specs and multiple talents over a single PVP talent.</div></div><hr />

All racials get buffed, the outdated forsaken racial gets... nothing? Breaking a fear for 45 seconds CD on trinket VS 10% reduced damage or 20% hp recovery over 15 seconds?<br />

Warriors getting nerfed (as usual) because of PVP, and from what I read we're barely competitive in PVE, with the 20% nerf to HS, it's probably gonna hit them hard? <br />

For 2-handed weapon based DPSers it's not worth it. Our hit cap isn't high enough to justify losing all the strength. Currently it's &quot;more blue gems than red&quot; that means that ALL red gems slots must be a hybrid hit/str gem, all blue sockets except one must be hybrid hit/str gems and one must be a pure hit gem. All yellow sockets must either be pure haste, mastery, or crit; or else hit/str and ignore the socket bonus. We can't use orange gems in yellow sockets because the str component will count as an extra &quot;red&quot; gem. So basically you're losing all the potential str from yellow sockets, half the potential str from red sockets and at least one slot worth of potential str from blue sockets, all for a ton of hit that you probably don't need and 3% bonus crit damage. Whee? I suspect that even for a lot of dual wield DPS it's not worth it. They're unlikely to go over their hard hit cap but only a few specs (Combat Rogues and Fury Warriors that I'm aware of) really benefit from approaching the offhand hit cap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still nothing about the &quot;no path available&quot; issue, why the hell the mushrooms should check for a path ? <br />
If someone think it's because you would otherwise spawn them in strange places and pull mobs you should not be able to: Hurricane can be used the same way<br />
<br />
Where's a viable defensive ability for PvP Boomkins ? some sort of stun maybe. EVERY caster class has one except Balance and Elemental<br />
Didn't they say they would change mastery for classes that don't value it at all ? Do they need a suggestion on how to fix the balance mastery without breaking PvE ? Here it is:<br />
Owlkin Frenzy: &quot;Attacks done to you while in Moonkin form have a 15% chance to cause you to go into a Frenzy, increasing your damage by 10% and causing you to be immune to pushback while casting Balance spells. Lasts 10 sec.&quot;<br />
Add to this talent somewhere in the tooltip: &quot;Reduce the cast time of your next spell by X%, this effect can stack up to X times.&quot; <br />
This way a Moonkin that is being trained down, is able to cast something between a Moonfire here and there (and use Cyclone like ferals do: Instant cast)</div></div><hr />

Except Horde have never outnumbered Alliance ever in the history of the game &quot;on the global scale&quot;. There was even a blue post recently about it. Although they stated it as a &quot;slight&quot; outnumbering by Alliance.<br />

However, I do agree that Horde racials did have an edge, at least in PvE, though much less so in PvP.<br />

Fucking retarded Blizz. Warrior no more.<br />
<br />
Mages don't do massive dmg, &gt;&lt; when will that malicious rumor end. Its the control we have that needs a bit of nerfing. Control = novas = frostmage dmg improvement. Look at the stats, mages are ABSOLUTELY not on top of the damage charts. A damage nerf will NOT satisfy you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I roll around with 3200+ Resil and 29k Armor as an Elemental Shaman, and I can get 1-2'ed by a Warrior for upwards of 40-50k in a global, so please don't act like you didn't need the nerf. It was already IMPOSSIBLE to get a warrior off of you, and with that being said their damage was out of control.<br />
<br />
And that's not to say Frost Mage damage isn't obscene right now, because it is, but don't act like because they didn't get nerfed you shouldn't, cause even after this patch good warriors will still be amazing, and the bad ones will still be awful.<br />
<br />
The nerf was mainly to arms mobility, which is what made the spec actually fun to play. The lambs to the slaughter change is a clear damage buff. 3 stacks of lambs to the slaughter&gt;charge stun&gt;colossus smash&gt;throwdown&gt;you're dead. I've played arms for years and would rather they remove heroic leap, throwdown and sudden death than have the juggernaut change go live.</div></div><hr />

It was one of the only good counters to the fact a shaman can just dispell all your dots, while in the process healing himself. The ignoring of the LoS mechanic was the only part that made it over-powered, otherwise it was fine. <br />
<br />
The UA nerf, though, is completely, utterly, beyond any doubt, uncalled for. It's already commonplace to dispell it, especially in the case of shamans. The idea behind the spell was to offer dispell protection for affliction locks, which it already does poorly in its current form.

For Bear, it's really not important (and if the armor buff is not a tooltip fix, then it is a buff). Sure, your damage got nerfed, but who really cares about that? Blizzard's Vengeance mechanic throws like 105810581 AP at you, you could practically auto-attack for threat. Almost all progression tanks are already avoiding hit and expertise like the plague for that reason. Ferals were already the highest DPS tank on every fight besides Magmaw according to WoL.<br />
<br />
For Cats, it's probably a dps decrease, but likely nothing incredibly massive. I imagine they'll adjust for it in a later PTR patch as there is still a lot of stuff missing in this one (Chaotic meta gem fix plox).<br />
<br />
Edited to adjust for the new patch notes and comments made towards this post.<br />

GOING BACK TO HUMAN NOW<br />
I also LOVE the warrior changes, I see them as a buff. I can glyph Piercing Howl instead of Intercept now, MS does more damage, and now I can use multiple abilities with LttS for 30% increased damage<br />
YES<br />
<br />
Idk though, ALL the racials are really good now. Draenai and Dwarf look particularily attractive. But I love human, and I bought the Mace so the extra Expertise is very handy.<br />
<br />
Also, for people QQing at Warrior HS and Cleave changes. You're all bad, k? Incite is for nubs, I kill people in ~5 GCD's without it. <br />
Having a really tough choice picking between Draenai, Dwarf, or Human. I love being a negrow and all... erm, Worgen ... But I find Darkflight just isn't as useful in high-end PvP, at least not as a warrior. We have lots and lots of gap closers, and if they're immune, I have stuns I can use. My arena partner is also a pally, so immunities like HoF can be dispelled. Stoneform is a fuck you Ferals, Rogues, other Warriors, and Death Knights. EmfH gives me an extra trinket slot, so I'd probably use the Strength Resil trinket, or the Tol Barad Mastery/Strength Proc trinket. GotN is an extra 20% health, which can be a life saver when going toe to toe with another non-healer DPS in arena, like a rogue... oh fuck, thats right.. recuperate... Well, Warrior or DK, then. I think I'll be going back to human, thats what I was when I made the character, and has been so for 3 1/2 years, save the last 3 weeks.</div></div><hr />

Get back *to* ?<br />
<br />
Speaking from primarily a shadowpriest PoV, you getting *back* on a priest implies he's managed to get you *off* him. <br />
<br />
Druid pounces, you get dazed. Druid eats your face for 15-20K. Druid puts up a bleed. Bleed ticks for 8K/tick. You fear him. Druid 'zerks, and charges you. You're now slowed, stunned, *and* bleeding like a chainsaw factory victim. You psychic horror him just to get *some* distance. He trinkets it, and proceeds to create _another_ new orifice on you. You throw Devouring plague and SW: P because you're not getting a case time off with a druid all up in your grill. You fade to remove snare. Druid reapplies and proceeds to try beating you to death with your own severed legs. You Disperse, because shit, what else can you do? Druid pops out of form to heal the approx 10K you've done to him. You exit disperse, druid finds new ways to impale you on your own ribcage. Second fear comes up just in time for you to cast it, but while the druid's running around feared, you die from his bleeds. <br />
<br />
So aside from being relegated to getting perhaps 1-2 cast time spells off inside the 30 seconds, how exactly do you see the priest getting the druid *off* him for more than the time it takes for the druid to 'zerk/trinket/pounce you and fire a 35K ferocious bite into you?<br />
<br />
Sorry, that was a bit of a rant, but feral druid damage and mobilty - much like arms warriors - is out of control at the moment, as seen from a Rogue/Spriest/frost DKs point of view, anyway. Seriously, though, how do you manage to, with a straight face, slide past the fact that a combopoint building bleed from a feral druid ticket for approx 4 times as much as a 5 point rogue *finisher*? And then complain about mobility? *blinks*</div></div><hr />

The note hasn't been added yet, but we haven't forgotten. Here's what you're likely to see in the patch notes:<br />
<br />
-Meta gems with the Chaotic and Relentless prefixes now have a requirement of 3 red gems.<br />
<br />
-Added new meta gems: Agile Shadowspirit Diamond (Agility/3% critical damage), <br />
Reverberating Shadowspirit Diamond (Strength/3% critical damage), <br />
and Burning Shadowspirit Diamond (Intellect/3% critical damage). <br />
<br />
These new recipes are unbound and can drop from any Cataclysm creature. The new meta gems have a requirement of 3 red gems equipped.<br />

Yet the 2 classes with major buffs IMO are them two classes lol? No mension of the extremely poor shadow priest aoe, or weak Mage dmg in pve.. However I love the changes to disc.<br />
<br />
According to Blizz, they found survival PVE damage a bit too high, and frost AOE DPS too high. From a PvP point of view, hunters don't seem to be in a particularly good place so far, and as for DKs, well, sure. Unholy gunning necrotic strike is out of whack, while frost is pretty weak outside of BG rampages. <br />
<br />
And yeah Spriest AoE is effectively nonexistant, Sear drains mana for hideously low damage, and SW: P'ing 4 targets and running around like a retard for apparition procs isn't particularly hot, either. Actually, shadow now facing arena without bloodlust/timewarp is definately not looking good. Sad to have been pidgeonholed so badly that we're relying on another class to be viable. Good stuff for Discs, though. Dunno if it'll be enough to make disc truly viable in comparison with the other healers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't make any sense. The entire point of these nerfs is exclusively for PvP and primarily Arms. How often are you going to use Cleave in PvP? Exactly.<br />
<br />
The reason why most warrior tanks are gonna wonder wtf just happened when 4.0.6 hits live is they just lost power in TWO threat tools (also, don't forget War Academy on top of that!) and significantly diminished control tools due to their opening move, Charge being made to share DR with their other control tools. The former has a much bigger impact than the latter in PvE, but its still a signficant impact for effectively no reason at all. There were no prot warrior pve or even pvp issues stated by Blizzard (they cannot stun AND damage like the dps trees), yet they effectively get hit the hardest by far from all these pvp nerfs! <br />
<br />
It's the arena/pvp craziness hitting pve all over again! It's effectively stealth nerfs to a tanking spec.</div></div><hr />

Heroic Strike was nerfed because it is the most damaging ability that we have. It was supposed to be a rage dump but instead people would save rage up to slap people with Heroic Strike because it was doing so much damage. Now, it should be more of just a rage dump.</div></div><hr />

Probably because mana burn sucks... It was never very powerful, at least no where near as powerful as drain mana was. I've seen many Warlocks whose only spell they seemed to use (when fighting a mana user) was drain mana.<br />
Even though mana burn isnt very powerful I do think it doesn't make sense to not remove it as well, Blizz has said they dont want peope having spells they don't use.</div></div><hr />

By the way that post sounds I think three days is an extreme overestimation. I'd be willing to bet that they drop extremely often. Also they drop off of ANY Cataclysm creature, so if you were to level another character to 85 chances are you'll receive all three (and possibly more than one of each) by the time you hit it.</div></div><hr />

He means we have to do the JC daily quests which award us 1 token per day, and each recipe costs 3-4 tokens to buy. Someone did the math awhile back and just to get all the vendor recipes it will take a JC 266 days of doing the daily every single day.

I'm sorry they fixed one of the weakest defensive cooldowns in the game, which is mostly useless in PvE content, so that we DONT get insta-gibbed via Overpower spam when we use it. With the Master's Call reduction, you might actually have to play smarter against a Hunter instead of mindlessly spamming your abilities against a class that is practically powerless in melee range. <br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, I'm hoping the Deterrence mechanic change makes it more useful in PvE.</div></div><hr />

You're completely right. The deterrence change (against melee attacks intended for pve being used in pvp) and Master's Call changes (against increased snares on all classes) are very welcome, at last. Still have very little defence against dots tho - but its looking like this is fully intentional, unlike the mess the old Deterrence was. At least Blizzard are going in the right direction for Hunters in pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unholy DK's = Unholy Might (passive) has been reduced to a 5% Strength increase, down from 10%.<br />
Survival Hunters = Into the Wilderness (passive) has been reduced to a 10% Agility increase, down from 15%.<br />
<br />
Yet warriors really are not doing all that much, example no CC abilities that last longer than a few seconds. DPS really is just averaging with other classes as of right now. They really are not all that special. But to go from now to a HERE IS A 20% DAMAGE NERF... come on really? 5% on str and agi for the 2 classes doing the highest dps (according to blizzard)? Did they just duck as the nerf bat flew into the un-expecting face of the warrior? Then also within the same blue post say, oh arcane and fire mages are a bit on the low side of dps? really? seen many pull single target 20k+ with 346 gear. If that's low then boy oh boy do warriors need some buffs, along with most of the other classes.<br />
<br />
Honestly, doing things like this on their part should honestly be grounds for termination, cause they really need new people that actually know how to plan things and not just spout off random numbers.</div></div><hr />

For Bear, it's really not important (and if the armor buff is not a tooltip fix, then it is a buff). Sure, your damage got nerfed, but who really cares about that? Blizzard's Vengeance mechanic throws like 105810581 AP at you, you could practically auto-attack for threat. Almost all progression tanks are already avoiding hit and expertise like the plague for that reason. Ferals were already the highest DPS tank on every fight besides Magmaw according to WoL.<br />
<br />
For Cats, it's probably a dps decrease, but likely nothing incredibly massive. I imagine they'll adjust for it in a later PTR patch as there is still a lot of stuff missing in this one (Chaotic meta gem fix plox).<br />
<br />
Edited to adjust for the new patch notes and comments made towards this post.<br />

Sorry man, but these nerfs are un-needed. Reducing, that is, DRAMATICALLY reducing feral bleed dmg means we have an even greater unlikelyhood of killing any caster class. If all you can do is keep spamming mangle (with a miss rate, and resil) at a mage until their blink or iceblock comes back up, you have no chance. No chance. And hunters locks and spriests are now in the unkillable territory. And as for holy paladins, instead of watching the fight and seeing who is messing up, or getting hit by the rng dmg, and using holy shock- wog, you now have to spam holy light over and over and over and over, no matter what, even on people that aren't misisng any health to get free spells to proc. I can't see this shit lasting more than a day. Pallys are gonna be oom with the first minute of a fight, having to use expensive spells to heal people, instead of knowing the fights, and being predictive and pro-active. Awful.<br />
<br />
And wtf they buffed every gd alliance racial is beyond me. It's obvious the persons in charge of wow have ZERO idea wtf they are doing. Oh well, Halo mmo, or the old republic might be good.</div></div><hr />

Why are u doing this now? Just take out the warrior class because they are gimp now... For all the warriors out there... Just reroll another class<br />
<br />
Are you serious, warriors will now go from dealing 60k+ in a couple gcds to actually having somebody live through an intercept stun. Their PVE damage will be fine (and as always, next tier of gear they'll scale MUCH better than every single other class and wreck people again).</div></div><hr />

<br />
On live, it's definitely 10/20% currently. Is this a decrease from a previous PTR patch, or is it actually getting increased? Damn you confusing patch notes!</div></div><hr />

I honestly have to laugh every time I see a warrior say WTFBBQYUNERFCHARGE!?<br />
I then see that same warrior charge someone, heroic leap away into an intercept, and get only 1 dr against their throwdown.<br />
They took he stun off heroic leap for a reason, and it wasn't so you can get OUT of range to stunlock someone in the ground...<br />
Warriors complaining about mobility problems when they're using leap to get another stun.<br />
derp</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't want bears to be immune to player fear - program it to be unusable against players - not NPC's. <br />
It seems to me that a lot of the changes that keep happening to all the different classes are <br />
based on something I could care less about -- PVP -- and end up highly detrimental to what I enjoy most. <br />
<br />
Only bright side to this patch is finally getting a warstomp in bear form. Now if they'd only give me my thorns back...</div></div><hr />
