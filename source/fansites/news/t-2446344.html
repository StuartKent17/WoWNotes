They will cop out, like they did during the WoD Blizzcon: no live questions were allowed, the representer brought cards with questions from forum/twitter/redit etc and read those. Our only hope is some brave souls heckling them, or if no one shows up</div></div><hr />

<br />
So Blizz is being consistent then. 100% they are not addressing any issue in current WoW that has been pointed out to them in 8.1...you don't have to believe me, just take a trip on PTR and verify for yourself.<br />
<br />
BTW, Legion was launched on 8/30/2016 (1 year 9 months after WoD launched) with 7.1 dropping 10/25/2016 (8 weeks after expansion launch) and Trial of Valor raid dropping on 11/8/2016 (2 weeks after patch launch; 10 weeks after expansion launch).<br />
<br />
In comparison, BfA was launched on 8/14/2028 (2 years after Legion launched) with 8.1 dropping 12/11/2018 (17 weeks after expansion launch) and Zuldazar raid dropping sometime in 2019 (3 weeks absolute minimum after patch launch; minimum 20 weeks after expansion launch).<br />
<br />
Blizz has had *way* more time on BfA than most of their best expansions. We really are down to the last possibility anymore...Blizz simply isn't putting the developers towards WoW like they should. This is the reason the expansion is faltering.</div></div><hr />

Hmmmm it almost seems like harcore fans don't like companies destroying their favourite game (movie) just because of corporate greed and catering to anyone but the loyal fans... Hmmm no that can't be it, hundreds of thousands people are whiny man-children, that is a better explanation.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocc3cec8f443</div><div class="date">2018-11-03, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really hope that they talk about why OLD Warcraft III is not purchasable in BNET Store anymore.<br />
On reddit a user posted a screenshot of asking the support, why WC3 is not puchasable and the support only wrote, that he should keep an eye out/open a ear for more information coming soon.<br />
<br />
In view of the fact that SC1 got free2play too with the remake coming out, and Reforged coming out next year already, and most notably, WC3 not puchasable in bnet store, i could imagine that WC3 will be free2play soon too. Maybe even today? <br />
<br />
BUT PLS NO BLACK BARS LIKE IN STARCRAFT 1. I think they won't do it tho, because we cannot buy the game, so no one would be able to play stretched except the ones that bought the game already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think he's referring to the people that cannot express their disappoint any other way than saying &quot;fuck wyatt cheng&quot; or asking &quot;is this an April fool's joke?&quot;<br />
<br />
You do you, but this whole end of the world vibe going on seems a bit whiny to me. At least it's entertaining though.</div></div><hr />

Actually I think bfa is fine. I like more than legion but less than Wod. Cata will always be best, but bfa has still time to grow.<br />

Probably because you're in the EU and technically Blizzcon spans over three days for us. Look at day 3.</div></div><hr />

You do you, but this whole end of the world vibe going on seems a bit whiny to me. At least it's entertaining though.<br />
<br />
Many people are tired of being taken for granted as customers. They're tired of their brand loyalty being abused by years of laziness and arrogance. They're tired of being ignored when they ask for things, or being labeled as whiners when they have the audacity to complain about something they've shoveled hundreds or thousands of dollars into.<br />
<br />
Resentment that is ignored builds until backlash. If a developer has even one finger on the pulse of a community they're selling products to, they would understand that. If they had even one shred of humility (or just good business sense) they would PREPARE for potential backlash. Even if it didn't happen, they would be ready to face customers who weren't blown away by the latest batch of recycled bilge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this an april fools joke?&quot; is a great comment. It's fan-fucking-tastic, actually. It cuts through all the bullshit and forces the developers to face reality.<br />
<br />
If I had spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars to attend a marketing presentation (aka giant advertisement) and the presentation was this shitty, I'd be pissed.</div></div><hr />

Yep, this should be a good flame war,..<br />
I suspect blizzard may need to cancel this panel for fear of it getting worse.<br />
<br />
It's an absolute bloodbath on most forumd, youtube, twitter, reddit etc etc.<br />
If they're wise they just go &quot;ha surprise it was april fools after all,.&quot; and say what they're really working on...</div></div><hr />
