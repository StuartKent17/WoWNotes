In Patch 7.3.5, we made significant changes to the level 1–100 experience to ensure players can better enjoy the stories, quest lines, and zones they want to at their own pace. Because of this, we are adjusting the XP bonus on the Recruit-A-Friend (RAF) program to ensure it reflects the updated pacing of the game as new players level their characters and explore Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Dynamic Leveling in Patch 7.3.5<br />
As you may have heard, Patch 7.3.5 significantly overhauled the level-up experience in World of Warcraft so that zones from 1–100 will dynamically scale to your character’s level. Why? Over the years, we’ve made multiple changes to adjust the leveling curve—and as a result, the pace of characters’ progress has become significantly out of sync with the content. Players often out-level areas long before they’ve had a chance to complete key stories and quest lines, leading to a less-than-ideal experience.<br />
<br />
With this significant update to pacing, the existing Recruit-A-Friend program would no longer provide the best experience for players new to World of Warcraft. Even with scaling zones, triple-speed leveling would mean new players going into dungeons could find themselves overwhelmed by multiple new abilities gained over the course of a single instance run, and might still outpace storylines that help the world make sense and make players feel like they’re part of it—and we want new players to feel at home in Azeroth.<br />
<br />
To align the Recruit-A-Friend XP bonus with the upcoming leveling changes, we have reduced the XP boost gained from the Recruit-A-Friend program when playing with a linked friend down from 200% (300% XP vs. base XP) to 50%* (150% XP vs. base XP). We are making these changes to ensure the XP boost doesn’t upset game balance and undermine the experience, while still giving a significant XP bonus to you and a friend as a thank-you for being part of the Recruit-A-Friend program.<br />
<br />
Recruit-A-Friend Changes in Full<br />
<br />
The XP boost has been reduced from 200% bonus to 50% bonus*, effective today, January 22, 2018.<br />
If you’re already actively participating in the program, fear not! If you either sent or received an invite before the change went into effect today, once the invite is accepted you and your friend will still receive triple XP* (200% XP bonus) until the link between your accounts expires (90 days from the date the new recruit’s account was first created). Please note: RAF invites expire after seven days.<br />
Heirloom gear XP bonuses will no longer stack with the RAF boost (i.e., the maximum XP boost you will see from today onwards is 50%). If you were already on the program, Heirloom gear will still stack.<br />
All other rewards are unchanged and yours to enjoy:<br />
<br />
Summon your friend once every 30 minutes.<br />
10% bonus reputation from kills that grant reputation.*<br />
Level granting: for every two levels your friend gains while the accounts are linked, they can grant one level to one of your characters.<br />
Recruiter rewards, including game time and epic mounts.<br />
<br />
<br />

Blizzard are pushing it. They increased leveling time with the flimsy excuse that they wanted players to experience the story etc. But they also removed xp pots, nerfed heirlooms, and now this. All they want to do is inflate their time played metric and sell more boosts.<br />

It was bad enough they are 'improving the quality of their low level experience' by not doing anything about the story, gameplay or plot (you know, the things people actually fucking care about in an MMORPG.)<br />

All they are doing is making leveling elongated and a bunch of fanbois are out in force trying to tell you that stuff taking a lot of time=satisfaction.<br />

Just to respond to this, in MY opinion, if you know about the potion, specifically the one form Krol The Blade, the Digested bags and the one rare on Timless Isles (forgot the name of the potion and the mob, my apologies) and you are WILLING to put in the time to farm it and get it. Than you are both skilled enough to know how to play the game, and want to NOT level enough in order to invest the time in it.<br />

This could just be a cashgrab I just can not find any other explanation.</div></div><hr />

If you don't want to level and were buying the second account purely to speed level a toon then you were doing it wrong anyway unless it was for a ton of characters/multiboxers. <br />
Recruit yourself and buy a copy of legion on sale linking the new account to your main then BAM you get a level 100 boost you can use on either account for 1/3 of the price of a full price 100 boost.<br />

Ahhh yes, forced social interaction, the pinnacle of MMORPG design only three decades old.<br />
<br />
If you're going to lock efficiency behind being social you might as well just remove the RPG aspect and call it a Massively Multiplayer Online Social Experience, since clearly it's that 'experience' that Blizzard cares about far more than the actual game.</div></div><hr />

What I don't even, where is the logic there?<br />
So you don't want to be social but you want to 'Recruit a Friend'. <br />
That statement seems a tad contradicting.<br />
<br />
Nor did my previous post have anything do to with maximizing efficiency through any social means. <br />
Just stated there were more efficient routes if you did choose the P2W method which many people seem oblivious to.</div></div><hr />

Heirlooms, if you have as many equipped as you can, give you a 55% EXP increase. If it doesn't stack with RAF, then you are essentially fucking yourself over, with only a 50% EXP increase. At the least, there is no benefit to RAF, anymore, other than a mount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So... For you an RPG equals skipping the content until endgame? Efficiency IS NOT what represent Role Playing Games. You're contradicting yourself buddy. Also Blizz has removed SO many aspects of the game that made it more social by adding &quot;efficiency&quot; like LFR/LFD. I'm not saying these changes were bad but it did take a toll on the social aspect of the game. <br />
<br />
Any improvements they make to the social aspect is welcome in my opinion. It is harder to find players you enjoy playing with than deciding to play alone.<br />
<br />
Also RAF wasn't being used the way they wanted to since long ago so it's only normal that they remove the XP benifit after revamping the leveling experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well RAF was a paid service as well.<br />
<br />
Buy an [Elixer of the Rapid Mind] of the AH, ~60k and there's 300% XP.<br />
You can min max that boost pretty well<br />
1. Enter dungeon, use pot log out.<br />
2. Tank pulls the entire dungeon.<br />
3. Log back in<br />
4. Tank deletes entire dungeon.<br />
5. Log out repeat.<br />
<br />
You can also have a quest log of 25 quests to hand in which will scale with you as you level now to hand in.<br />
<br />
There's a few other options if you don't want to spend 4 wow tokens on a 100 boost.</div></div><hr />

Ruining the game??? In what way? You think &quot;this game&quot; is just about end level content? The faster you get to max level the faster you clear the latest raid... then what??? Is that the game you like? Just that?</div></div><hr />

i'm sick of blizzard's paid cocksleeves going around defending every stupid thing they have done. literally the only reason they're doing this is to drag out hours played for their investors. it's incredibly scummy.<br />

most people wanted to finish zone stories before they greyed out. level scaling accomplished that. increasing experience needed to level and nerfing heirlooms was nothing that anyone asked for.<br />

if you want a hard leveling experience, fuck off to the classic server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering that there is virtually zero engaging content provided outside of max level and leveling is repeating the exact same quests over and over with new scenery I'm going to go ahead and say most players generally only care about stuff they participate in during the current max level as its the only place Blizzard produces new group content that also contains enough other players to actually find people to do said content with.<br />
<br />
That's not to say someone out there doesn't enjoy the lore or just sinking into a place where they can basically go on auto pilot and remove their brains via doing the same quest for probably the hundredth time or more. Its just that I think most players are smart enough to look elsewhere for a story that's actually decent and most outspoken players are probably invested enough to prefer doing something that isn't brain dead</div></div><hr />

This is your opinion. I love all the content before max level. In fact it's at max level that the content is more repetitive. Same world quests, same dungeons over and over agiain... Killing the same bosses in raid night after night... I mean... Talking about repetitive...</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, so you love the questing. I however hate it, I play for the max level content. I enjoy raiding and content that actually has a level of challenge to it. Pressing 1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2 until the quest mob dies isn't engaging to me, its mind numbing. I like the satisfaction of improving my performance from week to week and getting them shiny upgrades. I would love to have more max level characters but, even more so now that its even longer, I don't want to slog through content that I loathe. Make it optional, lower exp rate for some small benefit; gold, higher gear drop rate, whatever.</div></div><hr />

To each their own. You and me cannot understand each other. If you think that leveling and questing for me is just about mashing button you dont understand at all! I love the story, I love the zones. I want to take my time to finish everything and feel engaging in the story. You just want to breeze thru content until you reach end game... You just have to understand that there's alot of people who enjoyed this game in many other ways that you. And this patch is maybe not for you, but for alot of other players.

Considering that we all know that we’ve entered the end of expansion content drought, this is the most logical comment I’ve seen. But, you’ll be called an idiot bc there are a lot of people convinced allied races aren’t unlocking soon. This is actually gonna be kinda funny.</div></div><hr />

Ok so why does their way have to come at the expense of mine and people like me? If they made it optional in some way everyone would get what they want. However like others have said this feels eerily like some underhanded move towards selling new boosts. So they have no real intention of even trying to please all sides.</div></div><hr />

I mean, you could always do that if you wanted. Just don't use heirlooms. I have full heirlooms and I rarely use them now if I'm in a leveling mood since it's more fun to get upgrades and not one shot everything. Just because you have the option doesn't mean you need to use it.<br />

This is clearly for money, since there are plenty of options for blizzard to give the player the choice if they want bonus xp or not. Could even add a slider option for RAF that lets you choose how much xp you get, up to 200%.</div></div><hr />

There really are some people who prefer the journey to the destination. I've met quite a few players over the years who will level a toon to cap and then instantly go about leveling another in a different area with different quests. I know its hard to believe that millions of people don't all enjoy the game in the exact same manner, but they really don't.<br />

They nerfed a component of the game, which costs as much money as a boost, so they could sell more boosts.<br />
<br />
This was done to facility the new level system, and make it harder to earn heritage armor. Someone could power level every allied race in a couple hours during the course of RAF.<br />
<br />
what? buying a battle chest costs like 5$ to 10$ and you can level more than one character with it. A boost costs 60$. how in the world are they the same price?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they were so hung up on boost sales they wouldn't give EVERYONE who buys an expansion one for free. If they sell 10 million copies of Legion, they give away $600 million in potential boost revenue. And they've already confirmed that BFA will have a free 110 boost. <br />
<br />
So yeah.<br />
<br />
I get it, though... conspiracy theories are fun, especially for those of you who think you have all the answers.<br />

Fair point. It doesn't and TBH I wouldn't mind if the RaF boost stayed in the game.<br />

I love the game don't get me wrong. But who asked for this change? There was literally no need to change it nor remove the XP potion. Which as I said leads me to believe it's being added to the store.<br />
<br />
I'm critical of the game where I believe it's needed. I've been quite critical of Legion in certain parts but I still think overall it was an amazing expansion. <br />
<br />
I don't mind the world scaling. Elites actually feel elite with this however normal mob scaling feels a bit out of balance. They should nerf the HP a little and buff the damage. <br />
<br />
Dungeon mobs and bosses could do with a small HP nerf and damage buff to compensate as well. Noxxion in Maraudon has 158k HP and literally nothing to worry about. What is the point? Now if he hit for a bit it would make sense but the HP tuning is a tad too much for something that hits like a wet noodle.<br />

I fail to see how farming something and investing time into said farming means someone is skilled at anything. That person simply has a lot of time on their hands.<br />
<br />
I believe you miss-read what I wrote. I wrote that if you know about the mob, then you are skilled in therms of actually knowing how the game operates and knowing the basics of it, i.e. you're not a new player. On the other hand, if you are willing to invest large amounts of time into farming said potion, then you obviously do not enjoy leveling.</div></div><hr />

Probably the same “mental gymnastics” people go through to justify every single thing Blizzard does.<br />
Even if some people never used RAF, it doesn’t mean they can’t see how hypocritical this whole thing is.<br />
They don’t want to “undermine the leveling experience” yet offer a 60$ boost. The same people that are fine with this change will be fine with the game going down the pitfall of microtransactions of xp boosts, rep boosts, honor boosts and eventually gear.</div></div><hr />

Also I think it'd be hilarious if the whole motive behind all these leveling changes are to whip the playerbase into such a frenzy that they can shitcan classic and be like &quot;LOOK AT ALL THE SHIT YOU RAISED ABOUT LEVELING WHY WOULD WE MAKE AN ENTIRE SERVER FOR IT&quot;.<br />
<br />
I just think it's fucking hilarious that leveling was never a big deal until some dev got a bug up their ass about it over the last 6 months and now its &quot;Oh we gotta get rid of XP pots.

I get it though. It's a business and I ain't gonna be mad. That's the point of a business. Make as much money as possible any way they can. I'm just glad tokens came out when they did so I got all the RAF mounts with throwaway accounts during christmas in WoD.</div></div><hr />

Personally i dont give a flying rats ass about this change.<br />
Sure i can see the frustration but hell, if you know what you are doing it doesnt take that long to lvl. The amount of exp you gain now from doing quests makes up for the time put in to lvl.<br />

Or you can just get some guildies and lvl together and speed farm dungeons, will just be a tad slower then before patch (that is if you arent garbage at<br />

Seems like a win-win. Blizzard makes money, leveling has a sense of accomplishment and progress. Having heritage armor feels like you've actually done something, and people whiny people who want to skip to max as quickly as possible can buy the easy route.</div></div><hr />

What you have to take into account here, is that Blizzard's intentions are clearly to slow down the leveling experience to improve the overall quality of that experience. I know that's what they're doing, because they have explicitly said so.<br />
<br />
I do not think this is a bad thing in any way. The leveling boosts in my opinion (and obviously Blizz's too) had gotten to the point over the years where it was totally out of control. People were getting new abilities faster than they could learn to use them, they were outleveling zones before even a third was completed. This is bad for the overall health of the game, and the new player experience.<br />
<br />
I acknowledge the point that some people hold, that Blizz has done this to increase boost sales. This could be part of it. But I don't believe this part in any way outweighs the improvement in quality to the leveling experience implemented. (My opinion on this will change if they put XP increase pots in the store, but until they do, I'm not making that assumption).<br />
<br />
I also acknowledge that to some people who just want max level characters without having to pay, this is an awful change. They will have to work harder/longer, and that's unfair. But I don't think that everything about the game has to suit all people all the time.<br />
<br />
Thinking about your question specifically. If it doesn't affect me, and I don't have to see it or deal with it, I don't care. Hell, I don't care if you get a button that boosts you to max in one press! Just don't ruin the things I (and many others) like to get it.</div></div><hr />

I and a lot of people simply don't care to smell the flowers in content I've done a few times before and just want to get to cap and jump into M+, or raid, or whatever.<br />
<br />
With the game soon approaching 120 levels, they really shouldn't be forcing everyone to be smelling flowers. That doesn't mean I don't want there to be the option, I just want there to be an option for both. More options are almost always superior to one option or no option, in my experience.</div></div><hr />

From what I heard in FF you have to complete every single story quest on a character to get to the endgame, which at least isn't a requirement in WOW.</div></div><hr />

I don't care that much, but why not just slow down the leveling experience if it's your first character to level or give the option for what the full amount was with heirlooms and RAF?<br />
I know a lot of people asked for a better leveling experience, but a lot of other people playing are trying to just hit max level as fast as possible on alts. Blizzard is just doing what they've always done and refusing to find some kind of middle ground that suits the majority, on both sides. No clue why they couldn't have just made it a feature you could turn on/off.<br />
If you want to slow level to experience the game the way you want to, that's great; but, why do I have to be forced into it with you? The flipside also works, I know, and that's that people that wanted a better story couldn't have it unless they paid for a feature to stop leveling. It's just a bad thing to not be able to find a middle ground and instead force people into some things.</div></div><hr />

I know that's what they're doing, because they have explicitly said so.<br />
<br />
I do not think this is a bad thing in any way. The leveling boosts in my opinion (and obviously Blizz's too) had gotten to the point over the years where it was totally out of control. People were getting new abilities faster than they could learn to use them, they were outleveling zones before even a third was completed. This is bad for the overall health of the game, and the new player experience.<br />
<br />
I acknowledge the point that some people hold, that Blizz has done this to increase boost sales. This could be part of it. But I don't believe this part in any way outweighs the improvement in quality to the leveling experience implemented. (My opinion on this will change if they put XP increase pots in the store, but until they do, I'm not making that assumption).<br />
<br />
I also acknowledge that to some people who just want max level characters without having to pay, this is an awful change. They will have to work harder/longer, and that's unfair. But I don't think that everything about the game has to suit all people all the time.<br />
<br />
Thinking about your question specifically. If it doesn't affect me, and I don't have to see it or deal with it, I don't care. Hell, I don't care if you get a button that boosts you to max in one press! Just don't ruin the things I (and many others) like to get it.<br />

Won't ever level a character again after this. What new players are they talking about exactly? The game is over 14 yars old, most players playing today arew the dedicated players who have been playing for 3+ years and are big fans of the game. The new generation would rather play shiny new toys like PUBG or overwatch and not WoW.<br />
<br />
They should be trying to make their current playerbase and veteran fans happy instead of trying to make the game accessible for a small market of new players. <br />
<br />
These levelling changes overall reak of desperation on sub losses and will likely lead to a boost in boosted levelling sales. I hope this is the last of the scummy moves on Blizzards end but I don't see it ending here...</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's all well and good, but removing all ability to fast level isn't a healthy medium its just dumping everyone into your ideal world. Yes you may want to level slow but not everyone dose and forcing everyone to do it your way just ends up pissing chunks of the player base off. This honestly screams of the same stupidity of No flying, no one was forced to fly but because some people lack the force of will to play the game the way they supposedly like they want EVERYONE to be forced on the ground. Same deal here no one is forcing you to use heirlooms, RaF, or EXP pots, but the people who are for this blanket nerf don't care, they cant just play the game without using them themselves, they need to be forced (along with everyone else) to play without the boosts to be happy.</div></div><hr />

problem is, they made leveling just loooooong. Hitting what amounts to target dummy for 15+ seconds is not fun or rewarding. And leveling that doesn't increase your character's relative power (on the contrary actually unless you have new gear ready every level) neither. <br />

This was done to facility the new level system, and make it harder to earn heritage armor. Someone could power level every allied race in a couple hours during the course of RAF.<br />

if you could power level every allied race in the course of RAF and every character to be honest..(i used raf 2 times and i leveled up 6 toons at a time) , raf practically cost much much...much less than a boost...right?</div></div><hr />

I don't understand why so many people are pretending to care. How many of you all even use RAF? And if you do/did, how do you not have most classes you care about at 100+ by now?<br />
<br />
No one is pretending to do anything here, we are pissed off at the fact that they are pushing the level 100 boost into our faces none stop, if you can't see this, then your a typical troll, just like most of those who keep defending the leveling changes.<br />

<br />
&quot;We are making these changes to ensure the XP boost doesn’t upset game balance and undermine the experience&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone trying to defend this changes while lvl 100 Boost still in store, is a colossal funboy who is gonna defend them anyway even if they started killing puppies on national TV. <br />
<br />
Only way for them to even slightly come clean is to remove the 60 bucks boost immediately. But honestly, ask yourself the possibility of that.<br />
<br />
At this point, there are no fanboing anything, the ones &quot;defending&quot; are trolls from now on, at least for me...</div></div><hr />

Yeah, sure, all the new players are gonna flock to the cash shop to buy their boosts. /s<br />

Me: &quot;Hey Steve, wanna join WoW?&quot;<br />
Steve: &quot;Depends, does it have a +200% exp boost for RAF?&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;Not anymore, sorry Steve.&quot;<br />
Steve: &quot;Guess I'll have to buy a boost then, despite me never having played this game and having no idea how long leveling takes - the lack of a +200% boost ruins it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this a realistic scenario? Is a new player going to buy a boost over this? No, not really, because new players don't care how big their RAF exp boost is. Not even a little. They'll either buy a boost or they won't, just like before. Not to mention most new players, if they boost, will just use their boost with Legion (which is cheaper than a boost anyway) - blizzard makes $0 from a new player boosting their first character.<br />
<br />
+200% exp is a cheat code which hurt the experience for the exact players it was supposed to be benefiting. RAF is not for you to get easy capped characters, it's for inviting your friends.</div></div><hr />

true, i can only speak for myself.<br />
i helped 8 people with raf and helped them always to get 1 maxlevel with decent gear.<br />
just leveling people to 90 and leaving is scummy.<br />
<br />
back then in wotlk i was recruited after having a breake end of bc.<br />
friend leveled to 60 with me. on a rp server....<br />
did the last 20 lvl alone, and back then the old zoned where &quot;classic&quot; scaled haha good old times.<br />

I don't see huge problems regarding this tinfoil theory about boosts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also I would feel so stupid claiming that they are doing this to sell boosts because<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Heritage Armor is neglected by boosts.<br />
2. Blizzard new method to show stakeholders how good is going WoW is to show the time spent logged, hence more time levelling more time logged.<br />
3. If they raise to 60$€ people will be less tempted to buy it and forced to level old way.<br />
<br />
Unless ofc you buy it but even in that case there are 2 scenarios : 1. You buy with $€ or 2. You buy with gold so basically it is free and you just spent time logged to farm gold, and this is counted towards the &quot;people are playing a lot wow&quot; call for earnings.<br />
<br />
<br />
All of this just show us that Blizzard is doing the exact opposite<br />
<br />
They are forcing people to level to make the &quot;time spent logged&quot; growing.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Also dont forget that if next week they announce pre-order, there will be a 110 boost so basically they are giving out free-60$ boost.</div></div><hr />

With the game soon approaching 120 levels, they really shouldn't be forcing everyone to be smelling flowers. That doesn't mean I don't want there to be the option, I just want there to be an option for both. More options are almost always superior to one option or no option, in my experience.<br />

I do like the changes about the leveling experience as I could level a monk to 60 without jumping from zone to zone doing only a few quests. Also I didn´t one shot any mob which is also nice. <br />
<br />
But I don´t unterstand why they nerf RAF. Hell even if there were many who created a new account for this. WTH cares. They pay to gain the bonus XP, so it´s ok. It´s worthless once you touch Max Level.<br />
But well I was also a bit upset about the heirloom changes. I paid a shitton of money to upgrade them all. Now the only thing they are worth for is the XP Bonus :(<br />

Hey guys,who ever feel exhausted leveling in WOW,can shift to FFXIV,maybe FFXIV not as good as WOW,but its leveling system much more fun,when you kill a trash mob,you will feel that you are too fast to kill it before you hit all the chain skill button,so just give it a try.<br />

My only Gripe with FFXIV is how you HAVE to do EVERY single patch of 50+ filler quests with like 15 patches between expansions. That stuff tired me and drained me so badly</div></div><hr />

You can still do 110 in like 3 days as evidenced by posters, you could easily argue levelling despite all of this is still too easy but this paticular change is irrelevent to many people who dont even know about the extra systems like RAF. Also it's not really a flimsy excuse to want players to experience more of the game while levelling, I personally hated not being able to play in zones without outlevelling them in five seconds and having everything be grey.

Also it's not really a flimsy excuse to want players to experience more of the game while levelling, I personally hated not being able to play in zones without outlevelling them in five seconds and having everything be grey. Obviously they should want people to spend more time on the game, that's sort of the point of having a business, having players use it.<br />
<br />
Giving players options to level fast has no effect on people who want to level at the standard rate. You don't have to wear heirlooms, or use xp pots, or use RAF if you don't want to. Blizzard has removed those options, or seriously nerfed them. Those options were there for people who've done the content already and had no need to 'experience more of the game while leveling'. Blizzard did this just before introducing new races that have to be leveled if you want the heritage armor, at a time just before a content drought. Removing options for people who wanted them was not done for their benefit, it was done to increase time played and prompt more boost sales.</div></div><hr />

Well you can believe that if you want but people often take easier options even if they may end up enjoying the harder options, it's human nature quite a lot of the time. I remember being so annoyed with dailys for suramar at the time then being like ah... what now? Also new players use heirlooms as well by begging high level players for gold, I've seen that happen a lot.</div></div><hr />

This is what those people that 'hate leveling but I need this 23th alt' are about.<br />
The only thing counterbalancing this alt explosion is the non-afk time needed to set this up.<br />
It is not about how much wall-clock time it takes, it is about how much active /played it needs.<br />
The major portion of /played is in the leveling.<br />
XP bonus stacking had made this part ridiculously short<br />
Multi boxing has put another multiplier on that.<br />
The more characters you already have, the faster you can make new ones as you can now afford services through paying for them in gold, so you are accelerating.<br />
Increasing the price, or lowering the 'bonus' of services that accelerate leveling is the only counter, although tbh it is probably too late and more steps will be needed to counter those that already have a massive alt army from monetizing those alts. You can already prepare for the QQ.<br />
Increasing the price of RAF would basically nix it for it's original intention.</div></div><hr />

making levelling content is probably the most time consuming element of making WoW and a large percentage of people that play these days want to skip it in order to get straight to endgame. (it actually amazes me the amount of people that despise the rpg part of this mmorpg).<br />
<br />
however, there is still quite a large amount of people who have no interest in raiding or endgame and actually really enjoy the rpg aspect of the open world and levelling side of things. WoW is still one of, if not the biggest, rpg's around. <br />
<br />
so the levelling change, is for the most part, a very big quality of life change for those players. <br />
<br />
so if you are one of those that is horribly upset about no longer being able to level at ridiculous speeds - suck it up buttercup, either put your hand in your pocket and pay for a boost, or accept that blizzards levelling design isn't intended to be skipped to the extent that has been possible (without paying for it).<br />
<br />
levelling has been a clusterfuck since cataclysm, that's a long time to have a really disjointed levelling experience and now it's finally being fixed. <br />
<br />
i mean honestly, if you never experienced levelling in wow before cataclysm, then you probably dont have any real idea of how levelling progress was intended and would likely contest these changes, but thats ok, you dont know any better. this is a good thing for the game and that's exactly why it's been implemented. it's been needed for a long time. well done blizz, i'm actually tempted to start a fresh character for the first time in about 5 years.</div></div><hr />

100% agree - I'm super thrilled to level another character, however as I already got a 110 of each class, I'm waiting for the new allied races before throwing myself at it. But I've definitely been tempted to explore zones and their stories that I previously haven't.</div></div><hr />

You can still just buy looms now for gold, high level players seem to give it out for fun if people beg enough or if people join guilds they will often fund newbies. So yes newbies can now level with heirloooms up to 110.</div></div><hr />

The idea was that because you can do things quicker with help you should get less xp so you don't level unnaturally fast but it doesn't always work that way in practice.</div></div><hr />

Well you see, I remember someone whining on this forum awhile back that they had to form groups to do dungeons in legion for recipes.

Well, there's certainly an argument to be made that Blizzard often has conflicting designs (i.e. pushing the game playing one way 90% of the time, and entirely different for the rest of the 10%, that's a legit argument and something Blizzard really fails at). <br />
<br />
Can't really be surprised people do that, though, I mean... they make this game anti-social until the final bits. So I don't really blame anyone for thinking that.</div></div><hr />

That's a bit harsh. It's fun to play with a friend because doing anything with friends is awesome. It's a pain in the ass because lots of parts are clearly designed around the assumption of it just being one person, and it makes it.... an annoying slog.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think anyone has ever asked for RAF to be nerfed. With nerfs to RAF, heirlooms AND basic leveling speed by raising the amount of xp needed the conclusion that at least part of the point is to raise boost sales is an obvious one.<br />
And as another poster eloquently stated:<br />
<br />
I think the changes to leveling and RaF are fine, but they are missing one thing: making those changes optionnal.<br />
<br />
Maybe add an incentive to &quot;Level the slow way&quot; (extra gold? priority in LFG dungeons? etc), but let those who want to level ASAP be able to do it without having to buy a boost<br />
<br />
Also where would your proof be that the majority of players is happy with all the nerfs to leveling speed? I'd be quite surprised if that were the case.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, and bear in mind that was before the new RAF leveling changes, they won't affact me now since I kinda predicted this stupid change and did RAF myself pre-7.3.5, but it will affect other people by making leveling even slower if you're using RAF.</div></div><hr />

People aren’t complaining that it’s hard. They’re complaining that we have to spend even longer than usual doing content we’ve all probably done a dozen times.<br />

First the nerf is not optional (an optional nerf would actually have been the right way to do this without pissing anyone off). Second I have no idea what &quot;exponential AFK gold farming&quot; has to do with my post.</div></div><hr />

Since one of the major reasons of the RAF nerf is to try and stem exponential AFK gold acquisition by having armies of alts that never leave their class halls, making it 'optional' as you applauded he other guy for the suggestion is missing the point completely. Scroll up if you need a longer explanation XD.</div></div><hr />

Again first: Where's your source for that because the Blizzard post at the start surely isn't. I am discussing the arguments Blizzard actually used to justify the changes, not anyones headcanon. I can also make up a lot of reasons for anything. <br />
Yeah, I say the NPC union has complained to Blizzard because players were too overwhelmingly powerful and they had more and more mobs needing to go to psychiatrists due to inferiority complexes. The money from the additional boosts this patch wants to rake in is needed for the bills.<br />
Second: the gold increase by parking alts in the class hall is linear, not exponential.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard are pushing it. They increased leveling time with the flimsy excuse that they wanted players to experience the story etc. But they also removed xp pots, nerfed heirlooms, and now this. All they want to do is inflate their time played metric and sell more boosts.<br />
<br />
They need to be careful.<br />
<br />
Or you could, yaknow, realize that WoW is a mmo and that there's more to the game than just what's up at max leve, ESPECIALLY for new players?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's why this would have been a great idea if it was optional and not forced on everyone even if they already have leveled a dozen alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Players have always had the choice not to take advantage of xp boosting items and methods. There was no need for Blizzard to remove or seriously nerf that choice from people who wanted it.</div></div><hr />

The difference being your reasons don't make sense<br />
<br />

<br />
You forgot the part where you reinvest the gold into tokens to buy and operate additional accounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where, exactly, in Blizzards post about this does it mention one of the changes is to help slow down/stop people from Gold Farming their Order Halls? Why was it not done before now after 90% or more of the damage has already been done? Stop making up bullshit to try and defend a stupid decision by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Until you want a transmog that Blizzard has now class-locked behind personal loot LOL<br />
<br />
But then the fanboy response would be &quot;no one is forcing you to transmog...&quot;</div></div><hr />
