Unfortunately this stream is very bad quality lol, keeps buffering, sound and image quality dropping over and over again, and &quot;rewinding&quot; 2-3 secs, repeating the same sentence etc, every couple of mins. This is not a internet issue on my end, was watching streams just fine before closing them to watch this. Oh well not gonna stop me from watching it I guess lol :)</div></div><hr />

And if they don't they just say how bad and fail the game is based on footage. Nothing we can do to stop that let just them talk and feel better about themselves. Who cares. If people like it let them be if they don't let it be as well I guess...</div></div><hr />

Not really. The first rumors about Titan were that it would be an RTS or RTS inspired MMO with cross overs to other Blizzard Games etc. <br />

I'm sure though that there are ideas of Titan hidden somewhere in this game ;)</div></div><hr />

And so they aren't allowed to bring out a new IP? Warcraft came out before Diablo or Starcraft if they didn't create new IPs there were be no people craving more Starcraft or Diablo. People are just being whiny children and demanding what THEY want rather than letting the company expand and attempt new things.

Pretty stupid logic. Same stuff was said about them copying CnC for Warcraft and Starcraft, Everquest for WoW, Magic for Hearthstone, and League/other Mobas for Heroes of the Storm. They are taking existing tropes, mechanics, gameplay, etc and making it their own and improving on it. Every new game in a genre does.<br />
<br />
So which one of those iterations brought you here, hmm?</div></div><hr />

Sure, because that huge cheer Metzen got when he said there was something new coming out was just a figment of our imaginations...<br />
<br />
People wanted something new. They're getting it. Some are just being whiny little children because it's not a type of game they care for. I pity anyone who has to interact with sad sacks like them on anything near a daily basis.<br />
<br />
On the surface it doesn't seem like a game I'd spend too much time in, but I said the same thing with both Hearthstone and Heroes and I was wrong both times. I'll be signing up for the beta and giving it a try, and I'm betting based on past experience it will be far more enthralling than what can be gleaned from a 3-minute gameplay trailer.</div></div><hr />

What did you expect? They released a new expac for D3 6 months ago, and we're a few days away from a new WoW expansion. Its a cycle, this year they put their main focus on SCII, next year it'll most likely be D3, WoW and/or Overwatch.<br />
<br />
I'll agree its disappointing on one point.. two big milestones in the warcraft universe, and nothing to commemorate this (so far) in their opening ceremony.</div></div><hr />

Mirro's Edge was something new. Portal was new. Minecraft was new. Why? Because they brought new type of gameplay.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is simply copy-pasting from 2 (or more) different games, instead of focusing of what is expected from them or at least &quot;expanding&quot; into something really creative and innovative. Sorry but's it's another &quot;selling hats and skins&quot; cash-grab into their pockets, just like HotS and Hearthstone.</div></div><hr />

Well considering you are in the gross minority when it comes to TF, your opinion is pretty valueless. You know way too little about OW to form any meaningful opinion. But it's obviously a fact that it's nothing new.</div></div><hr />

You seem reaching to bitch too since you're just reposting the same thing over and over. It shouldn't resemble any game. Blizzard used to innovate. Now they just reiterate.<br />

can't be that long until they run out of games that aren't a copy of something else</div></div><hr />

You know way too little about OW to form any meaningful opinion. But it's obviously a fact that it's nothing new.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Collected</div><div class="date">2014-11-07, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard is simply copy-pasting from 2 (or more) different games, instead of focusing of what is expected from them or at least &quot;expanding&quot; into something really creative and innovative. Sorry but's it's another &quot;selling hats and skins&quot; cash-grab into their pockets, just like HotS and Hearthstone.<br />
<br />
But that's what Blizzard do. WoW wasn't new, MMOs had been around for years. SC2 wasn't new, RTS games had been around for years. Diablo wasn't new, top down dungeon crawlers had been around for years. Hearthstone is just an electronic card game, nothing new there either. Heroes too.<br />
<br />
What Blizzard do is take the genre to a higher level and produce an extremely high quality game that is appealing to a wide demographic of players. That's what Overwatch is. It's entering into the team based FPS genre and it's mixing things up. That's what Blizzard do.<br />

While i dont remember reading anything about this anywhere iwill say that it would make sense. They have been working on Titan since around 2007ish. Scrapped it once and then cancelled it. They show up at Blizzcon with a game that it close to beta, so it would make complete sense for this to be close to what they were working on with Titan</div></div><hr />

1. There won't be anything else to buy after we buy it, right? <br />
2. It's a one time purchase and not a F2P (P2W) or a subscription based game, right? <br />
3. There'll be a downloadable server for it, and we'll be able to play it on a LAN that isn't connected to the Internet, right? <br />
4. We'll be able to make our own maps, right? <br />
5. This isn't some kind of game where you &quot;level&quot; your &quot;characters&quot; (quotes because these aren't characters, they're tropey classes with names attached) and thus become more powerful over time, ensuring a WoW-world-PVP-like &quot;I play all the time so I'm more powerful as well as more skillful/experienced, lol watch me pwn this n00b hey why don't more people WPVP?&quot; mentality..... right? <br />

If it was a &quot;direct&quot; copy of TF2, they would've been sued a long time ago. TF2 is bit more satirical and comical than Overwatch is (going by the anime/action tone they're looking to invoke), and we don't know enough about the classes to say if anything is an exact 1:1 copy. I saw some familiar elements, sure - I also saw stuff that has no parallel in TF2 (like giant dragons summoned by the archer guy, or the flying cyber-angel healer helping another flying assassin). My point is you're kind of having a knee-jerk reaction, and you're not quite alone.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter if you, in the very tiny minority, didn't like a game that was obviously extremely popular. All that matters is that Blizzard can't bring weak genres to life anymore (nor be responsible anymore for helping create new ones...like MOBAs).</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't say the MMO genre was weak when Blizzard entered it. Everquest was highly successful. They just came along at the right time to capitalise on it. I don't see a huge risk or problem with them dipping their toes into the team based FPS genre. Could have it's own e-sport potential too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It really does seem like Blizzard wants nothing more than to make a generic copy of games that are already out there.<br />
<br />
Sadly, they are just moving more and more away from any type of game I would want to play ( not their fault). MOBAs and now team-shooters, card games.. Would love them to try a deep RPG or something similar to what Bioware used to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was highly successful like you winning a local tournament. Their sub numbers were NO WHERE even remotely close to WoWs. The only reason it was well known was because of the niche crowd that did play ended up getting a lot of press because some people got so obsessed they ended up harming themselves or their children (by neglect). It really wasn't that popular and the plethora of MMOs that followed came after WoW. A genre isn't big until you start seeing a lot of clones. That didn't happen for MMOs until WoW.<br />
<br />
TF2 is HUGE. Blizzard is crazy to think they can compete with the pedigree of Valve.</div></div><hr />

Neither TF or WS are good games (obviously just my opinion) but OW looks good.<br />
<br />
They never said that. All Metzen said was that it's the first new thing from Blizzard for 17 years.<br />
And it kinda looks like a decent game. It's just that with the whole &quot;omg first new thing in 17 years!!11!&quot; hype Metzen was trying to build it just felt very.. underwhelming.</div></div><hr />

Nothing wrong with recycling art for a new game when you scrap the project. Blizzard seems to be diversifying. They already have an MMO, a Dungeon Crawler, a card game, a MOBA, and many RTS games. One of the main stream genres they were missing was shooter. Why would they create a second MMO to compete with the first?<br />
<br />
TF2 is old as hell and it's starting to show its age. People bitching about Overwatch being a copy of TF2 are wrong. It's more like a copy of TF5, way more features, improved graphics, even more class diversity. People will always fine something to whine about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anoiktos</div><div class="date">2014-11-07, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm seeing two major differences from anything TF2 or pretty much any shooter except titanfall has done in Overwatch:<br />
<br />
1. MOBA-style character mechanics (multiple skills, an ultimate) instead of purely gear-inspired mechanics<br />
2. Superhero genre-style movement.<br />
<br />
For the second alone, as a longtime City of Heroes fan, I'm loving Blizzard right about now.<br />
<br />
There's a difference between a clone and an iteration. Call of Duty XXVIIII is a clone. Mostly the same weapons, many of the same maps, almost all of the same mechanics. Heroes of Newerth was a clone. Exact same heroes, exact same map as DOTA. League of Legends was an iteration (Whether or not you agree with the changes it made from the DOTA formula) due to its alterations to stats, gameplay, pacing, and abilities. So is Overwatch, for its differences in movement and skill types.<br />
<br />
Art style... Okay? So they're using obviously stylized character models. That couldn't possibly be a good business decision based on the success of Warcraft III, Starcraft II, World of WarCraft, and Hearthstone. In fact, the only game Blizzard's released recently with relatively not-cartoony models (Diablo III) was also its only recent game that hugely disappointed the majority of its fans upon release (though they've rallied spectacularly).<br />
<br />
This is not to say it'll be a good game, or a fun game (though looking at Diablo III, I'm getting the feeling that even if it isn't, they'll keep iterating until it is). Just that I can't honestly call it a TF2 clone any more than TF2 was a quake clone.</div></div><hr />

Its Epic Games for future reference, and keep an eye on a little studio called Boss Key. Cliffy B from Epic started that studio and is working on a new arena shooter.<br />
<br />
Yeah I realised that later, that's what they get for not releasing a good game in 10 years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely - there's an entire generation of new players who *should* get to experience a TF style game, because that game is damned fun. <br />
<br />
I'm concerned that they'll &quot;Diablo 3&quot;-it up where you won't buy the game, you'll either rent it or it will be free to play aka play to win. That it will be online-only. That it will require you to level your character even though it's an FPS game. <br />
<br />
That younger brother in the video? I want him to play a game made for fun, not made by Jack Black from the Ugly Boy (by Die Antwoord) video which is pretty much how I picture Blizzard these days.</div></div><hr />

How can you possibly know TF2 is better? Blizzard has a history of taking genres and either improving them (Warcraft/Starcraft/WoW) or at the least making them more accessible to a larger audience (Hearthstone). Based on Blizzards track record there is a good chance Overwatch will not only be very popular, but it might even be much better than TF2.</div></div><hr />

my concern is blizzard are turning their back on &quot;hardcore&quot; games (mmo/rts) and are settling for casual stuff like mobas, card games, and casual shooters</div></div><hr />

So Blizzard is being Blizzard? They never stay to a genre or create a new one, they follow up the trend and turn it into &quot;mainstream&quot;.</div></div><hr />

TF2 literally has conga lines. I don't think there's ever been a more casual shooter ever made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How the heck...<br />
<br />
Yeah that was weird, but since Overwatch is essentially what was scrambled and reassembled from Project Titan, it is not so strange. As a distinct and chiseled out game with a title of &quot;Overwatch&quot;, it could have been in dev for 4-6 months, but it is built from what was developed during 6 years of Titan development.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What Magic the gathering are you talking about, because Magin Online and the real card game, wipes the floor with Hearthstone and stomps it 40 feet into the ground. Magic has a history, tons of cards and depth which Hearthstone lacks. Hearthstone however is accessible, easy to pickup, free and a fun time waster, and that's why it's popular. However there's no doubt in the universe, that Magic is the better card game. <br />
<br />
If the game you are referring to is MTG: Duels of the Plainswalker, well those games suck, lack features, and are basically intended for new players who want to get into Magic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, way to be the last person to the party with the same narrow, reductionist attempt at humour. Second, I've played tons of TF2 and this game looks like it'll be just as good if not better (indeed, everyone I've spoken to who actually played it at the 'con said they can already tell they'll be losing many days of their lives playing the hell out of this when it's available). Obviously I can't say with any certainty that it's great since I've only seen what everyone else here saw in the video/panel, but neither can anyone already claim it's terrible. Be a bit more objective and less knee-jerk jerks, guys.<br />
<br />
<br />
my concern is blizzard are turning their back on &quot;hardcore&quot; games (mmo/rts) and are settling for casual stuff like mobas, card games, and casual shooters<br />
<br />
Except they aren't. These games are being developed alongside the other games with completely different development teams. They're still releasing MMO and RTS content, or were you so blinded by unjustified outrage that you missed that there's a WoW expansion coming out next week and a SC2 expansion coming along within the next year? Honestly, it's not a bad thing for a gaming company to diversify, particularly when, like Blizzard, they have the manpower and resources to do so without skeletonizing their existing teams.<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW is getting old, no surprise that Blizzard finally sees it and doesn't want to focus so much on it. Deal with it.<br />
<br />
New expansion out next week. A further 3-4 expansions already planned for (according to interviews between the last 'con and this one). Still far more than enough subs to justify the cost of development of future content and a development team that's even larger than it has been in previous years.<br />
<br />
Yeah, they absolutely aren't focusing on WoW at all. Good grief, you people.</div></div><hr />
