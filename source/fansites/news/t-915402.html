You may have noticed we changed class talent trees for Cataclysm. We changed not just the trees themselves, as you might expect for an expansion, but the entire structure of the trees and the way you choose talents. Now that the Cataclysm model has been in play for several months, the team has been discussing what we like and don’t like about it, and I thought that might be of interest to some of you. As always with this series, this is design rumination, not a list of upcoming changes.<br />
<br />
What Worked Well<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The talent trees are simpler now, but without losing a lot of depth. Most of what we cut were passive talents that everyone took anyway, or really lame talents that did nothing.<br />
Choosing your specialization at level 10 and not having to delay playing your character the way you want feels great. You can play your shaman as Elemental or Enhancement with the tools and bonuses to make either work.<br />
Specs within a class feel different. This was a big challenge for the DPS warriors, warlocks, hunters, and rogues in particular. Nowadays those specs have different rotations, different strengths and utility, and a different flavor overall.<br />
Mastery integrates into the trees well. We can delay the complexity until higher level, and we’re at the point now where it’s a competitive stat for many specs (though to be fair, not all yet).<br />
There are some legitimate hard choices for many of the specs. Usually these come in two varieties: which talent you want before you can advance to the next tier of the tree, or where you want to spend those remaining talents after you’ve hit the bottom of the tree.<br />
At the risk of catching flak for this statement, I feel that the game is as balanced as it’s ever been. When you look back at the vanilla or Burning Crusade days there were many specs that were just jokes and the difference between the highest performing and worst performing specs was on the order of 30-50% or more. Nowadays, players worry about 5-10% differences. Those are differences we still want to fix, absolutely, but we’ve come a long way. The talent trees have helped us do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
What Didn’t Work<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I’ll admit there are still a few clunker talents -- those that are undertuned or just not interesting enough. There aren’t many though, and they’re relatively easy to replace.<br />
On the other hand, the talent trees still have traps for the unwary. For example, a Fury build that skips over Raging Blow is making a serious mistake. That may seem obvious to current players but it’s the kind of thing someone returning to the game after a hiatus might not understand immediately. (After all, you didn’t robotically take Ghostly Strike just because it was a gold medal ability.) While there is something to be said for safe choices, it would also be nice if the talents we expected players to have were talents they always had.<br />
Some players miss true hybrid builds. (Hybrid in this context means spending near evenly in two trees -- I’m not talking about the more common use of “hybrid” as a tank or healing class.) To be fair, these builds were either not very competitive or were just cherry picking a few powerful talents in order to create something that was likely overpowered, especially in PvP. In other words, the reality of the hybrid build never lived up to the myth. But it’s fair to say that it’s impossible now to have a hybrid build, and we understand some players want them back.<br />
I said above that there are tough choices within the trees of many specs, but there aren’t very many of them within each spec. Often it can come down to where to spend those last 1-3 talent points. While that was our goal, it would be even more exciting if there were more of those hard decisions. Hard decisions can be painful when you’re faced with excluding an ability or mechanic that’s fun to have. But overall we think hard, exclusive decisions are a good thing. They encourage experimentation and discussion and give players a chance to try out different things, all of which can help keep them engaged.<br />
Even worse, one potential place to spend those points is in the first two tiers of the other trees of your class, yet those talents are extremely design-constrained. First, they have to be attractive to the main spec using that tree, so chances are you’re not going to find much interest in the healing tree if you’re a damage dealer (unless you want to improve your limited healing). Second, those top-tier talents can’t affect higher level abilities since the talents are available at level 10. Finally, because those talents are available early, they should really be relatively simple to understand for new or returning players. You don’t want to put complex procs with lots of exceptions and internal cooldowns that high in the tree. All of those reasons mean that it’s rare that there’s a true game-changing talent available in those first two tiers. This would be totally broken, but imagine you could spend those last 10 points anywhere in another tree. Much more exciting, huh?<br />
This is a personal pet peeve, but I don’t like the talents that have a 33/66/100% chance to do what you want them to do. That’s just an awkward way of making a valuable talent cost more than one point. The new Cataclysm talent tree design didn’t cause this problem, but it didn’t fix it either.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Future<br />
<br />
This is the part where I’d really love to share our ideas for how we could address these problems, but some discussions are still a little too rough even for the dev watercooler. When we’re a little farther along, we’ll be able to share more. In the meantime, this is a great topic for further discussion. Players like to evaluate the talents in their particular class, but it’s also useful to evaluate the talent tree system as a whole. It’s an iconic design for World of Warcraft for sure, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be improved.<br />

I'm glad somebody came out to say it. It is the truth. The difference between the worst specs and the best specs is much much much closer than it is has ever been. It is even a little bit closer than it was in Wrath (not by much).</div></div><hr />

Stop here. No, really, no.<br />
The only choices appear when their's too much DPS talents in T1/T2 (ex: rogue).<br />

How to made your talent trees in Cata :<br />
<br />
- Put 31(32 sometimes) points everywhere in your primary tree, avoid PvP(or PvE) talents if you're PvE(PvP) hero.<br />
- Put the last points in the better talents of the other trees.<br />
- Still got points to spend? Congrats, you are a mage. We love you.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about hunters, but all 3 classes I play have plenty of options to put the last 5-10 points in all their specs I play... There is more variance in valid talents than it was in LK.</div></div><hr />

Dude, come on, I have a bunch of friends who graduated from UT, and very many times, I have to wonder how Greg made it through. He's such a moron. &quot;Talent trees haven't lost a lot of depth.&quot; If GC is srs about this sentence, there is simply NO hope for the future of the game.<br />
<br />
The game has lost all lustre, it's uncomplicated and quaint. There's no way to make the game your own, since people (cough cough) like GC have litterally zero understanding how to sandbox a game. Talent trees are worthless. You just get on EJ, do what they tell you and fire-and-forget.<br />
<br />
There have been some obtuse posts by rather dense devs before. This one falls to new lows, and it frightens me for the short-term viability of the franchise. I've always known Wow had (since Catas' release date) less than 24 months to go, but this new development makes me believe the game won't survive the year.<br />
<br />
Oh, well. Wow had to die sometime. Might as well flush Greg out of the mmo genre quicker, rather than drag it out.</div></div><hr />

i dont find it that hard to believe that he had the final say on many of the decisions that led people to leave the game. someone has to step up and accept responsibility for what happened to this game and the first guy that needs to go is him.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, makes sense to blame one guy who you don't even know for the supposed downfall of a game. Oh, and by the way, I know dozens of people who graduated from UT, and believe me, while some were incredibly intelligent, others slacked their way through.<br />
<br />
While I also don't agree talent trees still have depth, basing GC's apparent intelligence off blue posts is an incredibly naive thing to do. He's a designer and is vocal for WoW, he's not going to come out and say everything is broken, even if it actually is. Use your head.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With some of things he says, no it isn't naive. Assuming he chooses his own words and they aren't fed to him while he's just some mouth piece for Blizzard. I've played many online games over the years, I can legitimately say World of Warcraft is the only one where I have literally facepalmed over some of the things that the people speaking to the community have said and it hasn't been just once, but several times.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morsetlis</div><div class="date">2011-06-01, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The amazing thing about the current talent trees is that they minimize the &quot;increase your critical strike chance by 1/2/3/4/5%&quot; talents. Where these exist, they typically affect either only a subset of spells (Priest Twin Disciplines), or are comparatively powerful (Moonkin Nature's Majesty). If you compare the WoW talent trees now to the Rift talent trees, you immediately see the difference. (rift.zam.com/en/stc.html). I have to say I hate the Rift ones.<br />
<br />
The problem with the current talent trees is that they lead to cookie-cutter builds. Customization comes from one or two decisions in the tree. Often, the decision is made based on PvE versus PvP. Rarely is it made for personal style. I think Greg has it right that there need to be more meaningful, balanced decisions. For example, a paladin healer can choose to take 2/3 instead of 3/3 Tower of Radiance in order to get shorter cooldowns or longer range judgments. However, the longer range judgment talent is a whole 5 yards longer, and the additional healing it offers is complete garbage and weaker than a Tier 1 talent.<br />
<br />
There are still too many boring, mandatory talents. These should be reworked into 2-pointers at most, and have more dramatic effects. For example, Priest Twin Discipline should change from 2/4/6% more damage/healing to 5/10%. Priest Darkness should change from 1/2/3% haste to something like Druid Nature's Grace, where casting Mind Blast or Holy Fire procs a 5/10/15% haste buff for 10 seconds. Likewise, Druid Moonglow could change from 3/6/9% mana cost reduction to 10/20/30% mana cost reduction while under the effect of Eclipse, Nature's Grace, or Tree of Life. Mage Piercing Ice could change from 1/2/3% to Your Frostbolt increases the critical strike chance of your next spell by 3/6/9%.</div></div><hr />

Yea talent trees were VERY COMPLEX before cata. Grab all +X% dps talents and read what elitistjerk tells you to use as rotation, very...complex.<br />
<br />
As a prot warrior, at least, i have dozens of possible builds, there are literally 10+ different ways to spec the class and still be successful with it. As fury, i have 6 or 7 free points to spend anywhere i want, as arms i have about 10.<br />

<br />
If you want to be a surv hunter you choose surv tree and the talents are optimally filled<br />
If you want to be a marks hunter you choose mark tree and your talents are changed to the optimal mark spec<br />
<br />
As far as Hunters are concerned, the &quot;optimal&quot; Marks spec is fairly up in the air. It depends on if you actually want to get Silencing Shot, for one thing. The other thing is to choose between perfect points in Termination and add one point in Rapid Killing, or go 1/2 Term or 1/2 Bombardment and 0/1 Rapid Killing to get Marked for Death. It depends on if it's worth it to get that GCD for HM versus a small amount of focus regen at the end of the fight, more chance to get cheap Multi Shots, or a more powerful opener through trash.<br />
And Survival, I have actually taken Point of No Escape for my spec before versus the resist/Disengage CD shortener talent Survival Tactics. <br />
<br />
Some Priests get the .5 GCD Renew, some get Lightwell, some get the self heal. Sometimes, the norm is not what you use specifically. If you don't use Lightwell a lot, there's really no point to having it. Same with the self heal.<br />
Prot Warriors have a choice between a silence with Heroic Throw at a 30 second CD or not, depending on what they thing think it's worth. <br />
Resto Shaman have a choice to bring them some mana return through Lightning Bolts and a more powerful Shock. To do so, they go into the Elemental Tree to get more hit. Outside of that, they would go to the Enhance tree and get a speed buff.<br />
Prot Paladins before the WoG change had a few different spec possibilities that utilized WoG as a fairly regular cooldown. Not to mention Consecration mana cost reduction also being a choice.<br />
<br />
My point is, choice still exists. Optimality is a bit up-in-the-air thing nowadays. This may not be the case for a lot of specs, I'm sure (I'd like more choice in the Survival Tree, to be honest. Of the two, Survival is pretty cut and dry still), but I think if anything, Ghostcrawler's figured that out. Kind of the point of these blogs.</div></div><hr />

There's no point in me defending everything he says, because I agree with you some sound way off base; that wasn't my intention. What other MMO's have you played? I've played many, and if the dev feedback is actually there it's usually not much better than Blizzard's.

<br />
Anecdote battle- BEGIN! But seriously, he is terrible. He made 4-5 statements about talent trees and status-of-the-game that are simply so far divorced from reality, that my only conclusion about his apprehension regarding a game he has control over, is that he has no control. He's a friggin' moron.<br />
<br />
Talent trees are worthless, they are not a method by which a player becomes immersed in a class or role, they literally do not provide the player any object understanding of why a class is designed the way it is (all healers heal, all dps dps, etc) and the limited (read non-extant) variegation between specs of the same role is so subtle, that no new player could ever hope to understand how to choose a character based on the initial character creation screen. <br />
<br />
Wow, as a sandbox mmo where you choose your own adventure is a failure. Talents are the reason. You Look like everyone else, you Do what they all do, and you Go where they all go.<br />
<br />
Greg is... well he ain't heavy. And his lack consideration to the finer points of the game is obvious to any non-fan boy.</div></div><hr />

It's not supposed to have &quot;a point&quot; beyond sharing what they are thinking/thought. They don't use the water cooler thing for announcing features/changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also I agree that it added to the depth, everyone I have seen so far who disagrees has a flaw in their reasoning in where more talents = more choices, that was simply not true. All speccs I ever played where 100% min maxed (as most raiders do), there was almost no variety at all between same speccs, now I have a few points I can put into fun and/or highly situational talents. In BC/Wrath (don't remember much of Vanilla) &quot;hard choices&quot; were at most between a talent that gives 5% dmg versus one that does 4% dmg. It was only &quot;hard&quot;, because it hurt not being able to take the 4% one, but there was never a real choice in what to take unless you enjoy doing less DPS.</div></div><hr />

Stop and think about how upset this is making you, and re-prioritize your emotions. Also, if you think there is no customization to talent trees you clearly don't understand how to spec, the last 4-5 points are usually always optional. As well as a bit of customization before that depending on what your guild needs to clear content, such as Telluric Currents or Blessing of the Eternals (for resto shamans) try actually looking at your spec again, and read the talents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He isn't the &quot;lead designer&quot;. The lead systems designer is the one who controls the systems behind the game such as the concept behind the talent trees, etc. He doesn't actually oversee the balancing of the classes or designing of abilities.<br />
<br />
IIRC, Kalgan is still the class lead, and Daelo is the lead raid designer. He doesn't have control over the game, just the concepts behind it, which is a very large distinction.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dude, come on, I have a bunch of friends who graduated from UT, and very many times, I have to wonder how Greg made it through. He's such a moron. &quot;Talent trees haven't lost a lot of depth.&quot; If GC is srs about this sentence, there is simply NO hope for the future of the game.<br />
<br />
The game has lost all lustre, it's uncomplicated and quaint. There's no way to make the game your own, since people (cough cough) like GC have litterally zero understanding how to sandbox a game. Talent trees are worthless. You just get on EJ, do what they tell you and fire-and-forget.<br />
<br />
There have been some obtuse posts by rather dense devs before. This one falls to new lows, and it frightens me for the short-term viability of the franchise. I've always known Wow had (since Catas' release date) less than 24 months to go, but this new development makes me believe the game won't survive the year.<br />
<br />
Oh, well. Wow had to die sometime. Might as well flush Greg out of the mmo genre quicker, rather than drag it out.<br />
<br />
Vanilla talent trees were exactly the same FYI and so were TBC ones and so were Wrath ones.<br />
<br />
Just because you didn't know the optimal build doesn't mean there wasn't one. There will always be a &quot;best build&quot; for a class. You could ALWAYS go to EJ and fire and forget, but a lot of people didn't know about the site back then.</div></div><hr />

When you look back at the vanilla or Burning Crusade days there were many specs that were just jokes and the difference between the highest performing and worst performing specs was on the order of 30-50% or more. Nowadays, players worry about 5-10% differences. Those are differences we still want to fix, absolutely, but we’ve come a long way. The talent trees have helped us do that.<br />
<br />
I'm glad somebody came out to say it. It is the truth. The difference between the worst specs and the best specs is much much much closer than it is has ever been. It is even a little bit closer than it was in Wrath (not by much).<br />
<br />
If you played Vanilla or BC, you definitely know he is telling the truth. When I do a raid or dungeon now, I can handle people showing up with any spec. In Vanilla and BC, there were probably 10 different specs that if people showed up in, they would be immediately sent to ´respec. Also, even looking at the 5-10% spead we have now.. a LOT of it just has to do with fight mechanisms. This tier, in general, is a bit hard on melee. I have no doubt if they had changed 2 bosses, the dps charts would be completely different.</div></div><hr />

Basically, Blizzard could integrate a &quot;guide&quot; or functionality with the same result into the game (also possible: recommended glyph choices based on spec, and probably other things.

<br />
His comment about ´choices´is the only thing in the whole letter I disagree with. In the past, there was very little choice. The only choices you made were pitfalls and mistakes. They definitely made the trees better as far as choices, but in my opinion, they missed an opportunity by not giving more options. Each tree should probably have 3-6 more talent points that are viable. Most specs probably have 3-6 total points that are real choices, that isn´t enough, but it is still more than I had before the new trees.</div></div><hr />

You just get on EJ, do what they tell you and fire-and-forget.<br />
<br />
<br />
First, I'll address a sandbox game: WOW is NOT a sandbox game and never was. If it was I could pwn all classes easily with just a touch of my finger or I can just stand there and they should die from just touching me. I can create a mountain in front of you and slam the entire world of Azeroth on top of your teeny head. A true sandbox game does not take balance into account and is often very unbalanced. They are almost always 1-player.<br />
<br />
Second, EJ is a resource that theorycrafts the best talent builds if you want the best. Without them, you would not be making this baseless argument and personal attack. Why don't you play the game without addons or internet resources and see if you feel more unique. Just a suggestion.<br />
<br />
Finally,I know you are nerd raging but, please don't make dumb comments that have no basis in the MMO space. Go play a 1-player PS3/X-Box360/Bameboy or whatever system you may have that can cater your sandbox dreams.<br />
<br />
My opinion on trees from experience: When I talent my trees without the use of internet resources like EJ, it does feel like I need to make tough decisions. At the same time it feels easy and more streamlined based on my goals as a player what talents are obvious choices. I do feel that I need more excess talents to spend at the end of a level 85 but, it doesn't bother me much. This does make choices tougher since the limited excess points and I like that. The balance is definitely much closer and I appreciate Blizzard in continueously balancing the game. For example, I still remember playing warrior back in BC days and feeling awkwardly powerless without a pocket healer but, now I feel like I can hold myself well even without a healer. Overall, good post by Ghostcrawler. My question now is, what are you going to do next to correct issues you have identified? :-)</div></div><hr />

There's really no arguing what he said, because it's true. Is it perfect? Is it where they want it to be? No, nor did he even remotely say that. He simply offered a comparison of how balance used to be, compared to today. And if you seriously think the game was any more balanced than it is today, my god are you hopeless. There are many, many more specs in PvE and more specs competing in PvP. On the other hand, there are some specs that aren't delivering in either... but compared to how it used to be (where most classes had 1 spec for each aspect and some of those specs being garbage compared to others), it's astronomically better. <br />
<br />
When you are expecting perfection out of an impossible-to-balance game like this, I'd expect to get disappointed just like you.</div></div><hr />

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Yes, it's balanced if you play a mage. What a fucktard.<br />
<br />
Its technically more balanced because some specs used to be unplayable for either PVE or PVP, and they didn't even worry about, for example, Fury PVP, Holy Priest PVP, or Frost Mage PVE. Now the game is by definition more balanced because you can use those specs. So even though there are outliers now, its not UNTHINKABLE to use any tree for PVP or PVE--ergo &quot;balance&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It forces ppl to play one way instead of giving ppl the real choises of creating a build they like. There is no real need to force ppl into putting all points into one talent tree while leveling. In many ways it destroys the leveling experience since ppl are pretty much forced to play the same way from 1-85. Before you could have a choise of going semi tank dps - or healer dps and still do ok while leveling. <br />
<br />
Comparing WOW and RIFT talent trees is very intresting cause one got it right, gave ppl huge amount of choises while leveling - while the other created the same button smashing for 85 levels. I love the way RIFT did it - and I hate how WOW did it. And thats one of the main reason I play RIFT but not WOW atm. Cause even at high lvls you have multiple builds to take on all sorts of situations. In WOW... you are forced to be crappy raid healer if you are paladin (just for example) instead of REALLY giving ppl choises to play the way the need to fullfill any role in a raid. And this gets more and more obvious the harder the content is. Thats bad. PPL sitting out of raids because they play this class - and raids even chancelled when there are enough of the role but simply not the right classes ... thats even worse. This is the &quot;balance&quot; and &quot;choises&quot; BLizzard is giving ppl atm.</div></div><hr />

In the entertainment industry it's the producers that have the final say in a project (barring when the studios take an uncanny interest in what you're doing... say, for example, when you lose over a half-million subscribers practically overnight, or when your first-billed talent has a coke problem and risks losing his bond), even though most producers still tend to give directors creative control. <br />

He isn't the &quot;lead designer&quot;. The lead systems designer is the one who controls the systems behind the game such as the concept behind the talent trees, etc. He doesn't actually oversee the balancing of the classes or designing of abilities.<br />
Again, try to do some of your much-coveted research before spouting such nonsense.<br />
From Ghostcrawler's own mouth: &quot;Systems design specifically is everything that is not level, story, quest or encounter design. My team handles everything from classes to mechanics to items to trade skills to achievements to UI design, and that includes the game balance.&quot;<br />

I would have created 3 PVE trees and the fourth would have been PVP tree. Yes - seperate PVP and PVE all together and made PVP more of a sport rather than build. Since PVP does not even support an entire role like Tank in terms of gear.. that would have been the right way and given the game huge chance of actually going for balance vs variety.<br />

Agree. No need to do that while leveling since it takes away all experimentation. You are stuck with one build - half PVE talent and half PVP talents. Thats horrible design in terms of variety while lvling.</div></div><hr />

Honestly I don't know why some people play this game that obviously (from their posts) brings them so much anger and frustration. If you like other MMOs better and they fit your vision of a perfect game then log the hell off of WoW and play them already. <br />
<br />
It's like the people that come in here all the time and say, I haven't played since TBC, but Cataclysm SUCKS! I just don't get it, why come here if you don't even play or don't like the game. I hate tennis, but I don't spend all day on tennis forums complaining about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a prot warrior I've respecced more times than my entirety of playing WoW, because the optional talents are there and they are, for once, significant. Even though there are less points, the choices you make are far more significant. The number of floating points today are much larger than they used to be. Hence the talent trees are deeper. Nobody's going to give you a pat on the back any more for realising that you should pick up the talent that gives you your signature move or 10% more damage done.<br />
<br />
As for balance the game is balanced amazingly well compared to the past. Maybe your spec is no longer the OP spec it used to be, but picking a class to be OP wasn't going to be sustainable. Maybe mages are ahead at the moment, but their time will come.<br />
<br />
Frankly many of the suggestions like a 4th tree or Tri-spec are horrible ideas, so when you insult GC I can only imagine how bad the game would be with the fans in charge.</div></div><hr />

My eyes are open but then again I also can think subjectively. How come despite ALL the so called balance there are only a few comps in Arenas that work?

The talent trees are oversimplified to the extreme, no depth and less choices than ever before. Talent trees lost their purpose with this revamp. You may have removed bloat but you removed almost all personal choice by trimming them down so dramatically. The new talent trees did NOT work well.<br />
<br />
I completely agree. Blizzard gave us LESS choice with the new talent trees than what we ever had before. The simple fact that they no longer allow creative hybrid builds is proof enough that we lost just about ALL personal choice we ever had in speccing talent trees. Now, it's just.....pick a talent tree, put 31 or 32 points in it (basically almost always taking the exact same talents as everyone else....because let's face it, unless you are the dumbest person alive, you are gonna take the best, most obvious talent choices like any other competent person would), and then have 9 or 10 extra points to throw into whatever talents you want (once again, basically going for what everyone else does because of previously stated reason). Congrats Blizzard, you've effectively funneled every WoW player into speccing and playing the way YOU want them to, and not the way THEY want to. If Blizzard was compared to a government, they would definitely be a dictatorship. &quot;Oh hey guys! We want you to feel like you have a say so in things and your own personal choices, but in reality, you'll do exactly as we say and you'll like it!&quot;<br />
<br />
$10 says that if Blizzard ever &quot;revamps&quot; the talent trees again, they'll have you just pick a tree and it will automatically fill in all the talent points for you. &quot;Hey guys! We feel that allowing you to have your own choice in talents allows for to many overpowered specs. So we're choosing the talents for you from now on, so we can do shit the way we want to and not have to worry about anything else.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Hey, I ask myself the same question. I don't even attempt to PvP with my ele shaman. There's the whole pvp/pve balance that'll never work, mainly because the game design is old and pvp was tacked on.<br />
<br />
With all that being said, and even with Mages being seemingly fine tuned to the nth degree and other classes (like shaman?) are barely touched... even with that stuff, I still would argue the game is roughly in a more balanced state that it has been in the past. It comes at the cost of homogenization though, which sucks. The pvp &quot;balance&quot; usually shifts one way or the other depending on the season or expansion, though. It won't ever be fully balanced. They'd have to redesign the game entirely from the ground up which I highly doubt would ever happen.</div></div><hr />

First, they have to be attractive to the main spec using that tree, so chances are you’re not going to find much interest in the healing tree if you’re a damage dealer (unless you want to improve your limited healing). Second, those top-tier talents can’t affect higher level abilities since the talents are available at level 10. Finally, because those talents are available early, they should really be relatively simple to understand for new or returning players. You don’t want to put complex procs with lots of exceptions and internal cooldowns that high in the tree. All of those reasons mean that it’s rare that there’s a true game-changing talent available in those first two tiers. This would be totally broken, but imagine you could spend those last 10 points anywhere in another tree. Much more exciting, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
I have an idea - why not make the major glyphs allow you to spend a talent point in certain tier of another tree. Imagine a prot warrior with sweeping strikes for the cost of a glyph, or Deadly Calm (hello over geared warrior in heroics) or die by the sword, or an arms warrior with blood and thunder AND thunderstruck</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just really don't feel like there's any customization at all, really. Want to be an affliction warlock? Want to be a prot warrior? Okay, well here are your specs, and if you're lucky you might have one or two extra points to throw in somewhere.

<br />
That may be true about &quot;specs&quot; but I wonder about classes, and much more importantly, roles.<br />
<br />
Requiring specific comps for PvP kind of limits the fun of it, to watch others play, to casually play up to mid-high competitive play. Top competitors it probably wont matter.<br />
<br />
I can settle with comps for PvE because those fights are static and something as a flat bar you can work up to, since everybody is fine with requiring tanks and healers in raids, I would prefer it wouldn't have to be that way but again I am not going to make a fuss about it.<br />
<br />
I think their argument is false on hybrids, they call it &quot;op&quot; seeking attempts, but its not, I did a arms-prot build in WotLK it wasn't more damage, I lost bladestorm and 12% DPS in trade for 3% dodge, last stand, 6% armor and 18% snare reduction, and concussion blow (a stun+dmg attack), or those who perhaps wanted to try things like warriors Dual wield MS builds, because some may like the MS rotation, but like to DW.<br />
<br />
People sought realistically &quot;another spec&quot; they wanted to add abilities from other trees to their own, I think they focus too much on what was warlock's version of hybrid seeking, which was purely damage gain influenced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game has lost all lustre, it's uncomplicated and quaint. There's no way to make the game your own, since people (cough cough) like GC have litterally zero understanding how to sandbox a game. Talent trees are worthless. You just get on EJ, do what they tell you and fire-and-forget.<br />
<br />
There have been some obtuse posts by rather dense devs before. This one falls to new lows, and it frightens me for the short-term viability of the franchise. I've always known Wow had (since Catas' release date) less than 24 months to go, but this new development makes me believe the game won't survive the year.<br />

Oh, well. Wow had to die sometime. Might as well flush Greg out of the mmo genre quicker, rather than drag it out.<br />

How about this idea: After you get to the bottom of one talent tree, you're allowed to spend the remaining 10 points anywhere in your main spec's tree, or anywhere within the top 3 tiers of the other trees? That sounds like a cool and mostly not-overpowered idea to me. <br />
<br />
And the solution to the last problem is really obvious; just change the 33/66/100% talents to be 100% but have their effect increased when you spend more points in it.</div></div><hr />

False, Greg &quot;Ghostcrawler&quot; Street joined Blizzard from Ensemble in February 2008 and worked exclusively on Wrath as a senior designer through late 2008 when subs had already hit the 11.5M peak during Burning Crusade. He was promoted to Lead Systems Designer during the Wrath beta which was his primary role for Cataclysm which started development during the Wrath beta. For 2 years, the subs did not climb and remained steady with even churn and new customers. It briefly spiked to 12M right after the 4.0 Cataclysm patch and then dropped to 11.4M 3 months later (and is probably under 11M and continuing to plummet today).<br />
<br />
TLDR: Ghostcrawler had a lead role and decision making authority for Cataclysm primarily and less so for Wrath - he had nothing to do with Burning Crusade or Vanilla which are responsible for the first 11.5M subscribers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Greg did that.<br />
<br />
Personal choice led to epics in Vanilla and TBC, for sure, but it was the choice of class and spec you picked, not the talents. Certain specs were just flat out awful and your chance of getting epics in them were slim to none. Did you see a Paladin on the character creation screen and it looked cool to you at the time? Well unless you like clicking the same spot on decursive (because it automoved the highest priority to the top of the hotlist) all night, then you should roll a different class. Ret and Prot spots were rare, especially in high-end progression. There was just no point when Warriors could DPS better and tank better.<br />
<br />
In TBC it got better, but there were still completely dominant PvE specs like Resto Shaman and Destruction Warlocks (I rolled Paladin in Vanilla and didn't like being forced to raid as a dispel bot so I rolled Warlock right before TBC came out. I may have made the &quot;wrong&quot; choice the first time but at least I lucked out on try #2).<br />
<br />
The change from 51 to 31 points did nothing for homogenization besides forcing players to pick the talents that were DPS increases and leaving other choices.<br />

<br />
Correct, but it is still a far stretch to say that the design changes have driven the subscriptions away or that the design of Vanilla and TBC gained the players in the first place.<br />
<br />
The game was picked up by millions because it was a huge world based on an establish IP that was relatively accessible compared to its competitors. It got around through word of mouth. WoW was big before they even added battlegrounds. WoW was big when a rogues were gods and could kill nearly anyone in the game (pre-diminishing returns on stuns).<br />
<br />
The game was absolutely awful when it made it big but everyone still loved it (including me). Now the game has lost subscriptions and everyone jumps on the dev-hating bandwagon as if it is their fault. In reality, most of the subscription loss and slow subscription growth (in Wrath) is likely caused by an increase in leaving players due to lack of interest. Eventually, people have explored all of the content, and they've leveled or at least tried all the classes. People start to realize that the game just becomes expansion --&gt; level up --&gt; gear up --&gt; expansion.</div></div><hr />

I agree that talents and class balance are in a much better place than they've ever been. It's delusional to think that decreasing the available points has &quot;simplified&quot; things too much. All it's done is remove obfuscation from a system that was already simple but obscured by cruft.<br />
<br />
In that vein, talents always have been and still are uninteresting. As they stand now (and IMHO as they've always stood), useful talents might as well just be handed to you at every other level, because the choice isn't really there; and what choice is there can be decided almost definitively by a simple simulator. So you have what people are complaining about - an albeit voluntary but perhaps nigh-compulsory behavior, which is that you just go to EJ/MMO forums, read the results of someone else's math, spec accordingly, and commence faceroll.<br />
<br />
People have done this as long as those resources have been available. There was nothing about old talent trees that made this less feasible.<br />
<br />
Here's what I think:<br />
<br />
1. Just end cross-tree spending altogether. It makes pigeon-holing the last X talent points too easy, and it shouldn't be necessary if you:<br />
2. Remove ranks and add more (unique) talents to each tree.<br />
3. Remove all talent dependencies. They effectively eliminate choice.<br />
3. Remove point-based gating and just gate (few) talents by character level if you must gate them at all - at level cap, all talents are available in any order.<br />
4. Each &quot;tree&quot; becomes more of a &quot;soup.&quot; Talent soup sounds delicious.<br />
5. Keep the (current) max of 41 talent points. Each tree should have 60 unique talents.<br />
<br />
The number of max-level talent combinations available per specialization becomes 2,044,802,197,953,900. This would make it computationally infeasible to optimize a spec through simulation. It would encourage experimentation. The &quot;best&quot; set of talents might not ever be discovered. At the same time, a random selection of talents in one's specialization should still have a fairly high chance of yielding average performance if played correctly.<br />
<br />
Hell, this would even leave room for opposing schools of thought to develop among players of the same spec, with their own locally optimized talent choices and unique rotations/priority lists in combat.<br />
<br />
The only drawback I can see is on behalf of Blizzard devs. As some consolation, most of the talents could be &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;uninteresting&quot; by GC's apparent standards (i.e. X% buff to Y), because you no longer have point-based gating and you can only snag 2/3 of the available talents. It's not the individual talents that (all) need to be interesting, it's the potential combinations thereof.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard has many designers: GC is a &quot;systems designer&quot; or maybe classified as a &quot;class designer&quot;, this is his specific area, which is also why the old WoW forums lit up so damn much on the dmg dealing section because he was always posting and people were always flaming at each other and using his quotes as their nuke buttons.<br />
<br />
Other developers are for quest design, dungeon design, level design, raid design, more system designers, UI and various other feature designers, PvP designers, lead designer(s) and there are many more and they can get more specific for each category.<br />
<br />
You can't blame him on everything because of his voice, although I will personally admit, although his logic is alright he is very stubborn. Usually it is until things get out of hand does he accept all the &quot;i told you so&quot; feedback given at times in regards to balance. I personally don't like some of the stuff he has thrown out as of late (late including later WotLK too)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the only intuitive portion of his whole fruity &quot;daydreaming&quot; ordeal.<br />
<br />
Yet as the lead designer for the team, he has the ability to DO something about talents such as this, and has not.<br />

<br />
At this point, they should just have you pick your 'specialization' then drop the points down the board 'Plinko' style as you level. Feral druid is maybe the only spec that takes 1/2 a brain, and that's only because it is really 2 specs on one tree.</div></div><hr />

It makes the game easier and basic, which isn't good. The only step forward would be you chose one tree and you instantly get all the points put it in and never have to chose individual talents.<br />
I guess Vanilla was easy and basic as well? Since you know, we had around the same amount of talent points to spend?<br />
<br />
What would have been the better option do you think? Just adding talents upon talents? What was so different pre-Cata? You still got the best spec from EJ and rolled with it, there was just more clicking when assigning the trees. And while the option to go hybrid-spec is gone now, is that a bad thing? Do you really miss the 17/17/17 special snowflakes who couldn't decide where to put their points and just spread them around like STDs on a Jersey Shore episode?<br />
<br />
Since vanilla there has been many additions - the gem system, the glyph system, new skills, new talents, more talent points, new stats. Path of the Titans was eventually scrapped but was planned for Cataclysm. While you may be OK with new stuff (who wouldn't), it has been increasingly difficult for new players to get around all the different systems in the game. Something had to be cut.<br />
<br />
I'm usually very critical towards blizzard and the direction they're taking the game, but this is one thing I totally agree on. You can't just keep adding more stuff, sometimes you need to streamline.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timmyotoole</div><div class="date">2011-06-01, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I completely agree. Blizzard gave us LESS choice with the new talent trees than what we ever had before. The simple fact that they no longer allow creative hybrid builds is proof enough that we lost just about ALL personal choice we ever had in speccing talent trees. Now, it's just.....pick a talent tree, put 31 or 32 points in it (basically almost always taking the exact same talents as everyone else....because let's face it, unless you are the dumbest person alive, you are gonna take the best, most obvious talent choices like any other competent person would), and then have 9 or 10 extra points to throw into whatever talents you want (once again, basically going for what everyone else does because of previously stated reason). Congrats Blizzard, you've effectively funneled every WoW player into speccing and playing the way YOU want them to, and not the way THEY want to. If Blizzard was compared to a government, they would definitely be a dictatorship. &quot;Oh hey guys! We want you to feel like you have a say so in things and your own personal choices, but in reality, you'll do exactly as we say and you'll like it!&quot;<br />
<br />
$10 says that if Blizzard ever &quot;revamps&quot; the talent trees again, they'll have you just pick a tree and it will automatically fill in all the talent points for you. &quot;Hey guys! We feel that allowing you to have your own choice in talents allows for to many overpowered specs. So we're choosing the talents for you from now on, so we can do shit the way we want to and not have to worry about anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Except.. no. Hybrid specs made it virtually impossible for a “normal” player to know what talents to pick, forcing them to rely on theorycrafters to tell them which talents were good. Everyone with a brain picked the talents that were picked for them and everyone else got called a retard.<br />
<br />
There are a fair amount of choices but the thing we have now, and we need more of, are choices between equally valid but different talents. Choosing between different sets of +damage talents is boring and stupid. Choosing between sacrificing some DPS for survivability, or some consistent damage for some burst, or threat for a tank CD, is GOOD.<br />
<br />
I play Frost DK, Blood DK, Holy Priest, Disc Priest, and Shadow Priest primarily. Frost has two viable specs (2h/1h) with a number of floater talents. Blood has quite a lot of choices for threat/vs CD/vs Raid buff/etc. Holy is pretty locked down but there are at least three or four optional points. Disc has two viable specs (atonement/non-atonement).<br />
<br />
I suspect if you had any examples of what you’re claiming you’d have presented them, but talking out of your ass is ever so much more fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Erm, they are actually more linear than they were before Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Pretty much this. Cataclysm talent trees are even more cookie cutter then they were before. Most specs prior to Cataclysm had things called options, aside from a few special specs anyway, I think Feral specs and Retribution were the ones that stood out as being so cookie cutter you couldn't possibly do it wrong.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't like the 31 point talent trees, or at least the way they are designed currently and Blizzard's mentality towards some classes. I mean the two characters I played most, a Paladin and a DK had some of the dumbest talents thanks to the 31 point design. Unholy forces you to waste a point in a useless PvP talent in order to progress down the tree and I am surprised they didn't address the issue earlier for PvE players. Another issue I have with the talent trees is too many damage talents in healing trees, and too many healing talents in damage trees for classes like Paladins. Seems stupid from a PvE aspect to have points wasted in certain talents for no raid benefit just to progress down the trees.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exorbitant Rage</div><div class="date">2011-06-01, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no point in me defending everything he says, because I agree with you some sound way off base; that wasn't my intention. What other MMO's have you played? I've played many, and if the dev feedback is actually there it's usually not much better than Blizzard's. People really tend to exaggerate Blizzard's apparent awfulness for the sake of bashing them, or they assume Blizzard is near perfect? Not sure.<br />
<br />
Speaking of MMO's only, I played the original Everquest for an extremely long period of time, I also played Warhammer Online and a bit of Guild Wars (Which people sometimes call an MMO, sometimes don't) and more lately Rift. I've played a ton of RTS games online as well, where they have the same type of feedback responses to balance and game play design decisions.<br />
<br />
As for everyone else, you guys are exaggerating what it was like to play in Vanilla. Being one-hundred percent as effective as another class wasn't as big a deal back then, this is coming from someone who mostly played a Retribution Paladin in Vanilla (I also played Shadow Priest and to an extent, Warrior, back then when leveling as a Prot Warrior solo you could die to green mobs starting with full health, there was even a Warrior Protest on my server at the time because of how bad it was that included hundreds of people - Argent Dawn US, but I digress). There weren't raid encounters back then that popped up and were just mathematically impossible to do due to DPS constraints. I'm not saying I raided level 60 Naxx, but when you could run MC or whatever else back then and you'd have the Hunters who would auto attack afk, or the people who would consistently stand in shit because there wasn't a mod to yell at them for it, or whatever else and you could still down content just fine you took the player, not the class. Granted, you couldn't just take 40 Ret Paladins and call it a day, but you can't do that today either. <br />
<br />
PvP is more imbalanced now than it was back then too, not counting when Mages could Poly you for 45 seconds, after that though. The more recent iterations of DK's, as well as how they performed right after having been released are more imbalanced than anything has ever been (Close seconds being Stunherald Warriors with Mace Spec or TnT stun Hunters). Sure, in Vanilla you had stuff like ZHC, ToEP, PoM, Pyro mages one-two shotting people (I still see one, two shots today at 85 under certain circumstances) but the thing is there wasn't Arena back then so if you did get one shot in a BG or World PvP you just came back and owned the Mage because they were useless otherwise (I had a 29 Twink Druid at the time, back when Druids were awful and I got ganked by a PoM Pyro mage and when I came back I managed to kill him because he literally was doing almost no dmg without that, granted he was probably awful too).<br />
<br />
Basically, with the raiding environment today (paired with sites like EJ) and the way Arena works (Deathmatch, you die, you lose points) the game HAS to be more balanced. Yet as some people have pointed out, you have things like Ele Shams, among many other specs that have literally 0 comps they can run and certain other specs who can run 1-2 choice comps (Which is almost as bad, unless you have friends who have every spec and every class ready to accommodate you) while you have Frost DK's, or Rogues, &quot;Hey, just going to grab whatever class I want in that other slot for 2's, or those other two slots for three's and get easy Glad&quot; (Barring the incredibly anemic specs, those being Ele Shams among others, I don't even play a Shaman at the moment nor do I intend to even if they were good, I am however distinctly aware of how awful they are).<br />
<br />
So, when he says, &quot;The game is as balanced as it's ever been&quot; (Could still potentially be argued it was better in Wrath), that may be truth but the fact of the matter is with how much balance matters now a days it still isn't good enough. Of course, that's all my opinion.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, the removal of hybrid specs is the single more damaging thing to happen to the game over the course of it's existence IMO. It took the one truly customizable feature of your character (Character models are awful, there aren't many choices, Glyphs are cookie cutter, gems are cookie cutter, enchants are cookie cutter) and removed it entirely. Sure, they made the game harder to balance, but Blizzard hardly ever really did their best to try to balance it (Make abilities work differently in PvP and PvE, it's not clunky, it just makes sense). This expansion there are very, very few choices to be made and it feels like you might as well deposit some guild into a vending machine and take out the &quot;appropriate&quot; spec, gear, talents, glyphs, gems, enchants, the only thing left over is to learn your rotation. Gee, how fun. I play MMO's for the RPG elements, RPG elements tend to lend themselves to customization more often than not. Just saying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I think ALL talent trees HAVE to lead to cookie-cutter builds. Unless to slightly different builds can offer identical DPS for example (which I dont believe they can), people like EJ will always work out the best possible spec, and thats the one most people will go for. However they do talent trees there will always be optimal builds. The reason this has become more and more the case is simply that more and more people are following what people like EJ say - its not the talent trees, but the community getting the last 0.1% out of a spec.</div></div><hr />

You wonder that because your sight is too narrow and you don't understand people. Your friends are most likely the same as you. Maybe when you quit having a biased opinion and try to see the picture as a whole and understand the reactions of your customers, then you and your friends will have a job like Ghostcrawler's.

<br />
What else could hunters press that wouldn't instantly drain their mana? That's also not taking into account that you never really needed 40 players to complete a Classic raid when it was current and could've probably gotten by with 15-20 who weren't incredibly slow.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP is more imbalanced now than it was back then too, not counting when Mages could Poly you for 45 seconds, after that though.<br />
<br />
You cannot possibly be suggesting that a time with the old Cheat Death and no DRs was a better time to PvP. Classic was not better than Cataclysm is, nor was BC or Wrath. You're entitled to your opinion, but when the top players at AJ say 'yeah, it's pretty balanced', I'm most certainly going to take their opinion above yours.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't even play a Shaman at the moment nor do I intend to even if they were good, I am however distinctly aware of how awful they are<br />
<br />
Then why even bother bringing them up if you have no experience whatsoever? Enhancement has gotten plenty of tools for PvP and, while the spec isn't the best one out there, they are most certainly much better than the free kill they used to be. Resto also is more than fine; after S8 I'm surprised they let two of the three specs stay relatively viable. If you're going to bring up non-viable spec, then talk about Holy Paladins, Holy Priests or Arcane Mages, not Elemental, which is getting a ton of buffs to help it out.</div></div><hr />

Blizz just get rid of the talent trees please, stop acting like they exist because they don't just water down the game some more.<br />
<br />
Exactly. At best, WoW now has 30 sub-classes. The talent trees were gutted and are now meaningless in Cataclysm. The trees are totally cookie cutter now for the majority of your points. Yeah, you might get a a couple of points to spend on talents that are meaningless in other trees. Great. Some improvement. Instead of having multiple viable specs, there is now 1 for each spec. <br />
<br />
They should have stuck with the forumla they had before. Gone to 76 points and added more talents. Yeah maybe the 1/2/3/4/5% hit/crit whatever talents were boring. Fine, replace them with something more interesting. Its not that hard to think of things to fill in with. Maybe if there were enough of those boring 1/2/3/4/5% choices and you had 76 points to work with you could get somewhere with them. 20% crit from talents? Now that is interesting and useful.<br />
<br />
They may as well scrap talens altogether now and just replace the talent trees with class specializations. No need to pick talents. Just pick &quot;Frost&quot; and now your a Frost mage.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exorbitant Rage</div><div class="date">2011-06-01, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So let's dissect this post...<br />
<br />
<br />
What else could hunters press that wouldn't instantly drain their mana? That's also not taking into account that you never really needed 40 players to complete a Classic raid when it was current and could've probably gotten by with 15-20 who weren't incredibly slow.<br />
<br />
Back in Vanilla you could chain chug pots and in some circumstances you could FD--&gt; Drink, the point is you had many Hunters who could do these things, but instead just auto attacked. So basically, you quote me and then try and refute my point even though what you are saying is exactly what I'm saying. The content now has stringent enough DPS, healing and tanking requirements that the classes have to be more balanced relative to one another. It matters more, they aren't close enough though.<br />
<br />
<br />
You cannot possibly be suggesting that a time with the old Cheat Death and no DRs was a better time to PvP. Classic was not better than Cataclysm is, nor was BC or Wrath. You're entitled to your opinion, but when the top players at AJ say 'yeah, it's pretty balanced', I'm most certainly going to take their opinion above yours.<br />
<br />
That depends on what you mean when you say, &quot;Do you think the old Cheat Death was better&quot;, currently most (if not all) top Rogues don't even bother taking it, meaning the talent is ineffective at what it's supposed to do. So in a way I prefer a useful talent over one that is so useless people don't even take it.<br />
<br />
No DR on things was clunky, but not anymore clunky than some of the things to exist today and to say PvP is more balanced now than it was in Burning Crusade is idiotic. I'm going to go even further on this, because you are trying to berate me. If you want, I'll PM you the realm and name of one of my characters who has Glad from several seasons, log onto them and show you my Glad mounts first hand. I can also get on Skype or Vent if you desire, in addition I can also log onto all my 80+ characters, the only class I do not currently have above 80 is Hunter. Every other class I understand to the letter. I am currently sitting on the highest Horde 3v3 on my realm as well, which if you desire to see my character first hand you can verify with the ladder on Arena Junkies.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, every high end PvP player, including the ones I've talked to on Arena Junkies think that PvP currently and this game as a whole is a joke, you want proof? Here you go: http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=186287, I could link a million other videos from other &quot;high end&quot; PvP players saying the same. Direct quote from movie summary, &quot;This game is a joke, and should be treated as such. It's a good idea to treat this video the same way. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Then why even bother bringing them up if you have no experience whatsoever? Enhancement has gotten plenty of tools for PvP and, while the spec isn't the best one out there, they are most certainly much better than the free kill they used to be. Resto also is more than fine; after S8 I'm surprised they let two of the three specs stay relatively viable. If you're going to bring up non-viable spec, then talk about Holy Paladins, Holy Priests or Arcane Mages, not Elemental, which is getting a ton of buffs to help it out.<br />
<br />
I never said I have no experience whatsoever. Reading comprehension is a good talent toi have. Also, I was talking about Elemental, I don't see why you feel the need to bring up Enhancement. Enhancement is mediocre at best and it really doesn't matter that Resto Shaman are incredibly overpowered when you realize that certain people didn't roll Shaman to heal. You want to talk about Holy Paladins or Holy Priests or Arcane Mages? Sure, I'll log onto any one of those and talk to you about them, because I have every one of those classes at 85 currently. All of them are reduced to extremely niche comps, just like I said earlier in my post and how that wasn't a good thing. But keep selectively quoting me bro.<br />
<br />
I'll close with, again, I can prove everything I claimed in my post by actually directly logging onto these characters and meeting you at newbie starting area so just PM me if you are interested.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, after seeing your posting history up to and including complaining about Frost Mages not being good enough it's incredibly hard to take anything you say seriously.</div></div><hr />

Take the Warlock talent trees (since thats what I am currently levelling), Soul Fire is integral to lots of talents but available at lvl54 - now they are fixing this in 4.2 but to similar but slightly lesser degree Incinerate is also used in many talents but isnt available til level 64. <br />
They need to make rotational spells available alot earlier in the game to make more talents relevant.</div></div><hr />

Then you would have had the exact same situation as now, just spread farther along. People would still be choosing cookie cutter talents. Expanding the talent trees does nothing whatsoever to solve that. All you end up with is more garbage talents to get to the good ones. And 1/2/3/4/5% talents are moronic, they're just point sinks and Blizzard did a good job getting rid of the most glaring examples.<br />
<br />
The people crying about a lack of choices have completely forgotten that talent trees have never really had much room for choices. EJ or some other group theorycrafts the best build and everybody copies them. Nothing has changed aside from the size of the trees.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's that we forgot, rather we just wish was choice. Blizzard decided to change the trees for the sake of making them more interesting and to give us more choice.

<br />
What people are really missing here, is the fact that everything has to be balanced. People cry about losing &quot;hybrid specs&quot; and want more &quot;fun talents&quot;, and usually they want something that's going to make them OP. <br />
<br />
I remember when mages could pick up PoM/AP/pyro and one shot just about anything. Yea, that sounds like a fun hybrid spec, but is it balanced? no. Blizzard could spend years developing well balanced, fun-choice filled trees for every class and every spec, but the problem is.... IT WOULD TAKE YEARS. I played since vanilla, I hated being forced to heal as an enhance shaman. Things are better now, there are somethings I miss about vanilla*cough* 2h WF, but its a way better game than before. The real problem with WoW now? The shitty community, its the people that play WoW nowadays that are killing it. Not the content.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rennadrel</div><div class="date">2011-06-02, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Except.. no. Hybrid specs made it virtually impossible for a “normal” player to know what talents to pick, forcing them to rely on theorycrafters to tell them which talents were good. Everyone with a brain picked the talents that were picked for them and everyone else got called a retard.<br />
<br />
There are a fair amount of choices but the thing we have now, and we need more of, are choices between equally valid but different talents. Choosing between different sets of +damage talents is boring and stupid. Choosing between sacrificing some DPS for survivability, or some consistent damage for some burst, or threat for a tank CD, is GOOD.<br />
<br />
I play Frost DK, Blood DK, Holy Priest, Disc Priest, and Shadow Priest primarily. Frost has two viable specs (2h/1h) with a number of floater talents. Blood has quite a lot of choices for threat/vs CD/vs Raid buff/etc. Holy is pretty locked down but there are at least three or four optional points. Disc has two viable specs (atonement/non-atonement).<br />
<br />
I suspect if you had any examples of what you’re claiming you’d have presented them, but talking out of your ass is ever so much more fun.<br />
<br />
Just no, Frost DK's are the same regardless of build choices as it plays the same and the only difference is you wind up wasting 3 good DPS talents on a hit rating talent, logically they could probably merge Nerves of Cold Steel with Threat of Thassarian and put something in the first tier that is good for PvE damage.<br />
<br />

At the risk of catching flak for this statement, I feel that the game is as balanced as it’s ever been. When you look back at the vanilla or Burning Crusade days there were many specs that were just jokes and the difference between the highest performing and worst performing specs was on the order of 30-50% or more. Nowadays, players worry about 5-10% differences. Those are differences we still want to fix, absolutely, but we’ve come a long way. The talent trees have helped us do that.<br />
<br />
I'm glad somebody came out to say it. It is the truth. The difference between the worst specs and the best specs is much much much closer than it is has ever been. It is even a little bit closer than it was in Wrath (not by much).<br />
<br />
Right, that's why Shaman and Druid DPS specs are all garbage and not very raid viable. Enhancement has been terrible for like 3 raid tiers, it's embarrassing.</div></div><hr />

There have been some obtuse posts by rather dense devs before. This one falls to new lows, and it frightens me for the short-term viability of the franchise.

Hopping on EJ to fire and forget has been the norm long before Cata talent trees.<br />

I just started playing an Elemental Shaman and there's no way in hell I consider Thunderstorm to be the &quot;tool&quot; that most benefits or defines the class.

that show just how out of touch you and the other wow devs are. If you play a paladin, the game is less balanced than it has ever been. I pvped as a paladin since classic and paladins now are in even worse shape than they were in BC or classic. I have to be honest Greg, you and the other devs, especially Tom Chilton are so completely out of touch with your player base that it is time for a change in leadership on the wow dev team. I will not return to WoW until there is a change in leadership on the wow dev team. The new leadership should not include you or Tom Chilton aka Kalgan.</div></div><hr />

I may have made the &quot;wrong&quot; choice the first time but at least I lucked out on try #2).<br />
<br />
The change from 51 to 31 points did nothing for homogenization besides forcing players to pick the talents that were DPS increases and leaving other choices.<br />
<br />
My roommates 1st toon (I played back in open beta) was on Shattered Hand; I played his holy pally (I now have my own holy pally on Terenas) with Jubei and was also in Drama and Death and Taxes. I pvp'd against Nodomino for a couple of years. I know how bad holy talents were back then, raid-wise. But you could still get them (epics) if you picked well. The game now does not allow you to make decisions. Your path is chosen for you. The difference in healing throughput is minimally affected by choices. Those choices actually take way too much thinking/playing to suss out (unless you use EJ, which ta-da, they do).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earll</div><div class="date">2011-06-02, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of talent trees are still really linear, some builds have few interesting choices but some are pretty much dead set in a specific path and anything else is sub optimal. <br />
<br />
What I personally like a lot is 2 builds of the same tree that both are good but still have some noticeable differences to them (mainly by adding a new ability\talent that gives you something more than just an increase in damage done or damage recieved in tier2 of one of the other talent trees.) . A few examples of how this is done well is Say for a Blood knight build. You can choose to either pick up Lichborne, which gives you 1 more survivability cooldown\ability (as you can now heal yourself\get healed by cooldowns.) But this will somewhat limit the talents you can pick up from the blood/unholy trees, so you will become very slightly weaker in terms of defense/threat generation, but have a nice extra ability that can awesome to have. <br />
<br />
Another example is Shamans Elemenetal (and restoration?) build. They can choose to pick up The increased movement speed + instant cast ghostwolf talent from tier 2 Enhancement, but by doing so they might be sacrificing some other slight DPS increases (right now you lose out on very little, while getting instant ghost wolf + increased movement speed is awesome though, so I would like to see the other trees be buffed some so it is more of a competetive option.)<br />
<br />
What I would like to see in a perfect world, is something like this: Every talent tree has a new interesting ability/talent that adds something unique to that build, in the tier 2 tree, without increasing your passive damage survivability or healing by a huge amount (can for example be something like a self heal or a Survivability ability for DPS classes, or a mobility ability) Something that is not vital to pick up for your class\role, but which will be a very nice bonus\help on a lot of bossfights. And then potentially add more &quot;good&quot; talents for increasing damage (or healing/survivability depending on what your main role is) <br />
<br />
Like for example an Assassination Rogue might have 33 'decent' dps talents in Assassnation, 3 decent dps talents in tier 1 combat, 3 decent dps talents in tier 1 subtlety, and access to one new unique/interesting ability that is not overpowered to the point of &quot;must have&quot; but still good enough to sacrifice a very small amount of dps for. <br />
<br />
Which will lead to 3 different types of builds emerging, one only picking up the DPS talents in tier 1 from the other trees and 33 talents in assassination, one build getting the subtlety utility ability and one build getting the Combat utility ability. Obviously balancing this perfectly would not be easy, but trying to aim for something like this would add a lot more variety to most classes options when it comes to builds, as currently the vast majority have the exact same builds for everyone, and they are stuck with choosing where to place maybe 2 talents in the main tree.<br />
<br />
That being said, the game is as balanced as it has ever been, and absolutely every single build for every single class is fully viable in any raid these days which is nice.</div></div><hr />

Holy paladins may want to have a word with you and everyone else who claim mastery is good as it is.<br />
<br />
Community have been telling blizzard since cata release that holy paladin mastery needs to be made again from scratch, yet they still refuse. It's worthless, everyone knows that, yet apparently they are happy with mastery in the game. Maybe they dont care about a whole spec trying their best to take as little as they can.</div></div><hr />

Where &quot;unique spec&quot; means &quot;look at what's recommended by EJ&quot;. Having a couple dozen more talents doesn't make for a unique spec. All it means is you have to spend more points to play the same way you do now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree. Usually, EJ would recommend (all other points are required) where to put your last 3-5 talent points back then. Now, it only recommends where to put the last 1-2 points, but most of the time requires where to put ALL of them. That is less than half the choice you had before.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crashdummy</div><div class="date">2011-06-02, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The game was picked up by millions because it was a huge world based on an establish IP that was relatively accessible compared to its competitors. It got around through word of mouth. WoW was big before they even added battlegrounds. WoW was big when a rogues were gods and could kill nearly anyone in the game (pre-diminishing returns on stuns).<br />
<br />
The game was absolutely awful when it made it big but everyone still loved it (including me). Now the game has lost subscriptions and everyone jumps on the dev-hating bandwagon as if it is their fault. In reality, most of the subscription loss and slow subscription growth (in Wrath) is likely caused by an increase in leaving players due to lack of interest. Eventually, people have explored all of the content, and they've leveled or at least tried all the classes. People start to realize that the game just becomes expansion --&gt; level up --&gt; gear up --&gt; expansion.<br />
<br />
I do not concur with you. Wrath slow subscription growth, to me, was because the world suffered the worst economic crisis since 1930.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm drop in subscriptions is based on all the stuipid changes made in this expansion, which broke a great game and tore it into pieces.<br />
<br />
I know that's why i left the game, and i know many more that left, none of them because of boredoom, ALL of them because of Cataclysm changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have a main mage and druid/warlock/hunter/rogue alts. I disagree. Back then, EJ would require just about everything short of 1-2 points. The discussions mostly revolved around what is the weakest dps/tanking talent that you can drop to pick up a utility talent that was extremely useful for a fight you're working on. There are more choices on utility talents to pick up right now.<br />
<br />
Speaking mostly as a fire mage/demonology lock, I have roughly 4-5 extra points that I can spend on a choice of 4-5 utility talents. I can max 2 or spread them out. Back then, I only had 1-2 extra to spend on completely underwhelming talents. There was a point where I spent a few months in Wrath with that free point unspent since the choices were completely pointless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is this any different than ever in this game? At least I can use my last 2-5 points to get a fun mobility talent, or a talent that helps with questing. Never had that flexibility before cata.<br />

He needs to stop saying the game is as balanced as it's ever been, it's bad enough that he just said it about PvE where it isn't true but when he said it about PvP a while ago it was downright ignorant. Other than that, he praises the hell out of their new system and the only downsides he chooses to bring up are ones that existed before the new trees, when he could have easily brought up some actual valid issues with the new system. But hey, WoW's perfect, I guess.<br />
<br />
when was this game the most balanced for PvP and PVE then? Vanilla? BC? Wrath? really?<br />
<br />
sorry but if you can't see how much more balanced the game is now compared to previously I have the feeling you just didn't play before Cata.<br />

&quot;There are some legitimate hard choices for many of the specs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erm, they are actually more linear than they were before Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
possibly, but if you were a serious dpser before cata, there was 1 spec that was right. no choice. And you needed to theorycraft a large part of the time just to figure it out. There were never any hard choices before cata. There are some now.</div></div><hr />

I pvp'd against Nodomino for a couple of years. I know how bad holy talents were back then, raid-wise. But you could still get them (epics) if you picked well. The game now does not allow you to make decisions. Your path is chosen for you. The difference in healing throughput is minimally affected by choices. Those choices actually take way too much thinking/playing to suss out (unless you use EJ, which ta-da, they do).<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like what you want is a completely bloated tree filled with bad choices so you can laugh at all the noobs picking terrible talents. &quot;If you picked well&quot; is a euphemism for having no choice at all since you had 1-2 free points max if you were truly min-maxing.</div></div><hr />

Street didn't join Blizzard until Feb 2008, as he was working at Ensemble (on Age of Empires games) prior to that. And at that point WoW was already at 10M subscribers...<br />
<br />
<br />
so he DID work at blizzard before they hit 12 million. Thanks for making that clear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can have 3 viable specs as a hybrid now because so many of your abilities of have been turned into renames of another class' skill. Your rotation is similar/same but with different names.<br />
<br />
There are essentially 4 roles in the game (caster dps, melee dps, tank, heal) with only ~2 variations of each role.<br />
<br />
As far as the 1/2/3% 33/66/100% talents being removed, I found those were where the most customization and depth was. When I got a certain gear upgrade, I could crunch some numbers (which is fun to 'hardcore' players), then determine that I could drop 1% of say, mana regen in turn for 1% more crit. I'd play around with, and find that with it, I just increased my dps a little but significant amount.<br />
<br />
A few weeks later I get a questionable upgrade, some new trinket with a questionable proc. I read up on the proc, I crunch some more numbers, and determine if I drop all my crit talents and load up on mana regen, I can spam harder, get the proc to hit, and have a net increase of dps. Again, this was fun.<br />
<br />
Less talents, less complexity = not fun.<br />
<br />
How about you leave the talents nice and bloated, and make a &quot;suggested&quot; path for newbies, which highlights &quot;really good&quot; talents that players should choose. Or add TOOLTIPS THAT ARE ACTUALLY &quot;TIPS&quot; about how the talent is used.

Except it was the fastest and largest loss of players ever, per Blizzard's own admission. And it was all in the first three months following the expansion's release. The real slow months have been April and May, and possibly June and July depending on when 4.2 launches. If they'd lost 600,000 subscribers by March, how many have they lost since?</div></div><hr />

Have to agree with this. They really screwed the talents with this expansion. They said the trees were bloated before but now we all look the same talent wise. I did like to pick up crazy builds and other things, it was fun to me. Now you are locked in a tree until almost the end of the game. This was the first time i wasnt excited for talent trees in a expansion. I remember how cool it was to wait for the extra talents (and points!) coming TBC and then wrath of the lich king.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Compared with absolute sterling perfection in all its majestic glory, Blizzard (and Ghostcrawler) really really sucks.<br />
Compared to anything else I've ever read from competitors, Blizzard (and Ghostcrawler) really majorly rocks.<br />
<br />
At Everquest, at least when I switched from EQ to WOW, only one DEV was in the same league as Ghostcrawler,<br />
and that was the then-new professions leader who came over from EQ-Traders.com.<br />
Everyone else was SUBSTANTIALLY worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
that show just how out of touch you and the other wow devs are. If you play a paladin, the game is less balanced than it has ever been. I pvped as a paladin since classic and paladins now are in even worse shape than they were in BC or classic. I have to be honest Greg, you and the other devs, especially Tom Chilton are so completely out of touch with your player base that it is time for a change in leadership on the wow dev team. I will not return to WoW until there is a change in leadership on the wow dev team. The new leadership should not include you or Tom Chilton aka Kalgan.<br />
<br />
Sounds to me you were used to playing a faceroll class/spec. Either way, no one at Blizzard is losing sleep over Rift. That game will come and go just like AoE, Aion, and WOL.</div></div><hr />

Might not be the case for all classes, but most of the ones i play.<br />

Actually i can't agree more : looking at the numbers (from simulationcraft or whatever) i've *VERY* glad all 3 (4) warlock specs are viable for PVE (5% between &quot;best&quot; and &quot;worst&quot;) so now i can safely play the one i like or the &quot;most adapted&quot; spec for every PVE encounter. Thanks a lot for that Blizzard.</div></div><hr />
