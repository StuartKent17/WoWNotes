Legion - Dalaran Relocation<br />
The Dalaran relocation cutscene has been updated since last time we previewed it. It now has voice acting and other tweaks. This is not live yet.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Legion Invasion Experience Fixes<br />
Thanks for all of the reports on issues with the amount of XP being rewarded. <br />
<br />
We were able to investigate and identify that there were indeed a couple bugs with the way XP rewards were being handed out. Weâ€™re working on a hotfix that will correct the following issues:<br />
<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that could reduce the amount of XP a player received when more than 6 players were attacking it. Fixed a bug that could reduce the amount of XP a player received from creatures that scale with the number of attackers.<br />
<br />
Once these fixes are live, please let us know how things feel. Again, our intention is for Demon Invasions to feel lucrative as long as players are actively participating in the event, and we believe that, once the correct amount of XP is being rewarded for killing creatures, that will once again be the case.<br />
<br />
So.... if a level 100 taps an elite, do I still get screwed?<br />
The intention would be no, once this is live.<br />
<br />
When are these going live? so we know exactly when we're supposed to give our feedback about it<br />
I don't have a time frame to provide right now, but I will try to provide an update once the hotfix is in - but since it is still being worked on, this could likely be tomorrow.<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion Content Drought<br />
No content Drought at the end of Legion? I don't believe you. You can say it won't happen but we've had that happen what.... 3 times? Actions speak louder then words guys.<br />
Actions do, indeed, speak louder than words. I think we all realize that this is a fact and that winning the trust of the community takes more than what some may see as just words.<br />
<br />
As Watcher discussed yesterday (in case you missed it), there was a period where our main focus was faster expansions, and in pursuit of that goal we sacrificed things that ended up making the experience worse for everyone.<br />
<br />
We are now focusing on a steady stream of content, and we are making sure to keep our story going alone and filling the time between new expansions. We really hope that you guys see this difference in Legion, and our goal is to avoid situations where we don't have significant content for 14 months.<br />
<br />
Not to sound like a cynic or anything, but we've literally heard the exact same thing at the end of every expansion since Wrath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I know this expansion's content drought sucked, but next time we'll do better!&quot;<br />
<br />
Followed by usually around a year of zero new content. I dont know what it is you guys are doing with the content development, but you've been doing it wrong for the past four expansions and I dont see any reason why we should believe Legion will be any different.<br />
And not to attack this sentiment (I know where you are coming from), but since TBC/WotLK, we've actively stated our goal was to get the length between expansions down to one-a-year as our way of combating a lack of content. This goal, we've realized, is what has created a lot of problems as we were turning all of our focus away from the current expansion and moving on to the next a bit prematurely.<br />
<br />
This is no longer the goal.<br />
<br />

Broken Shore<br />
On launch, once mains have done the full intro quest line (+Broken Shore/Kara/Ulduar) will the option to skip be available again?<br />
yes, once you complete the final quest in the chain, unlocks 8/30 (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/764974938142892032))<br />

I believe the way it'll work is the quest you are offered upon reaching 100 is the &quot;watch Dalaran move&quot; quest and after that there'll be an NPC who gives the option to go back for the Broken Shore stuff. I could be wrong though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
You still get the broken shore quest, but when you get to the quest turn in NPC you have 2 options one is do the broken shore scenario and the other one lets you skip it all and you get ported to Dalaran-Broken Islands where you get offered your Artifact quest.<br />
<br />
Also, when you get to Dalaran-Broken Islands we get a quest giver who spawns and follows you around that leads you to our Artifact. Sometimes you have to move around and wait about 15-20 seconds for it to spawn but it will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you get the very first quest to prepare yourself for the broken shore, the NPC you turn it into will have a talk option, where you say that you've heard it before. By confirming it, you'll instantly be teleported to the New Dalaran, ready to hand in the quest for the Dalaran Hearthstone and then continue your journey for the class hall and artifact weapons.<br />
<br />
This will only work after you've had at least one character see the teleportation of Dalaran cutscene when Legion has launched.<br />

I'm okay with that - if you're gonna copy, copy from the best. <br />
<br />
And, put this in context - this is a short, as a side-piece of entertainment for a game that has no other purpose to exist than to be fun. It's not being presented as a new, unique piece of fiction to stand on it's own and compete with The Iron Giant or Wall-E. They could have skipped these, and it would have no effect on the game at all. It's just fun - fluff if you will - and it's fine. <br />
<br />
But, their animation team gets better and better, and those skills DO go into the games in cut scenes and character design.<br />

<br />
Not gonna happen.<br />
<br />
It's on them. They say they're going to try. Let them. The decision to play is yours - you either take a chance, and try Legion, or don't, and post something smug here a year from now when they show they weren't telling the truth. <br />
<br />
I'm not playing, because I've lost all interest in this kind of game - but that's me. Looking at Legion, they're going back to what looks like MoP levels of content - which was fine in terms of quantity, they just timed it wrong. If they'd stretched out the tiers before SOO, the drought after SOO wouldn't have been so pronounced - which they admitted to. <br />
<br />
Legion should, with the amount of patches and tiers they're talking about, last a year and a half if timed right. Then, six more months of nothing, then the next expansion. That's a good goal to work towards, and they can do it. Will they? We'll see. But slamming them over everything they say, that's not gonna get much done. Again - it's now in your lap - decide to play, or don't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not in Blizzard office but how I see it, when an expansion launch there is a couple of content ready to be sent to us. If the current content team hear from the next expansion group that the new expansion will be release in one year, they start using that already ready content according, that how we end up having 3-4 months between content. Once they used the ready content, the current content team talk to the next expansion group and they are still far away of being ready for the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Now, if they already plan 18-24 months before expansion, they might increase the time before patch to 5-6 month and get more content ready before the next expansion. We shall see if this plan really work but I'm sure I was not in the only raid team that were killing the last boss of current content the week just before the next raid come out and kill the last boss of the expansion before the beta for the next expansion was out. Looking at wowprogress, we were not and even the 2-3 mythic guild were not killing the last boss on mythic before the next raid.</div></div><hr />

First of all, yes, yearly expansions has been a goal since Burning Crusade:<br />
<br />
https://www.engadget.com/2007/03/16/an-expansion-a-year-blizzard-says-well-try/<br />
<br />
It has never worked out and has never been a particularily good strategy, but they clearly wanted to try and create a short patch cycle followed quickly by an expansion in order to provide a steady stream of new content (and box sales revenue).<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, just because all your eggs are in one basket doesn't mean they'll hatch faster. Some things take time. Designing, developing, and testing an entire expansion's worth of content takes a lot of time, and it takes a lot of talented people. Just because they spend more money or hire more people doesn't mean they can finish the work sooner, since everything is still subject to a workflow with bottlenecks. The best you can really hope for is that it'll allow you to develop more content in parallel.<br />
<br />
As a metaphor, imagine you want to build a cabinet. Maybe if you hire two, or even three people, you can get it built quicker. However there's still a limit to the number of people who can feasibly work on a single cabinet at a time, and if you exceed that you get diminishing returns or even cause delays.<br />

Something a lot of people also don't ever seem to consider is that the game's production values have also increased considerably with the release of each new batch of content. Models, rigs, animations, and textures have more detail. There's more voice acting, more music, more cutscenes. New systems are constantly being developed and added. As they increase the fidelity of the game and the quality of the art, it takes more talent and more time to complete everything. This is true industry-wide, but with WoW -- a 12-year-old game -- you can really see the difference over time.<br />

I'm not saying you don't have the right to be pessimistic. Blizzard has promised an end to content droughts before, and has failed every time. However, it's worth showing at least a little optimism, given the fact that they've acknowledged the problem and are making a change to their design philosophy. Even if they are unable to deliver on the promise of shorter content gaps at the end of expansions, they've at least commited to providing a robust patch cycle for the expansion, so there should not be a shortage of content.</div></div><hr />

What's new about it that needed it's own video.<br />
<br />
The last time we previewed it, it did not have voice acting and was not complete. It is not live outside of beta, so most players have not seen it. I updated the video so people could see it before it goes live later this month.</div></div><hr />

As per Beta: You get the quest, and when you talk to the dude on stormwind docks (or whatever it is for you horde filth) you have a conversation option that says &quot;I've heard this story before&quot;, and it skips you all the way to new dalaran just before you get invited to do your artifact quest.</div></div><hr />

Ah, I understand.<br />
Just confused me, I thought they added extra sound effects or replaced the voice acting. I didn't know you last previewed it last without voice acting.</div></div><hr />

So I have a character who did the first part of the Kara-Dalaran line before I realized I had 730 gloves on him and abandoned the chain. Is he going to have to finish the Ulduar-Karazhan sequence to be able to do Legion content? Or is having finished Broken Shore enough?</div></div><hr />
