Its a minor nerf, but only if someone is pausing several days in between leveling sessions and letting the Rested bar fill up fully.<br />
<br />
For people leveling a bit every day, it'll have very little effect. Basically you gain Rested at twice the rate as normal, whereas now you lose Rested half as fast. Same net amount, but as it is currently you can 'save up' twice the amount - in this build you'll 'cap' Rested twice as fast, encouraging more regular leveling sessions.</div></div><hr />

It's a burf. <br />
<br />
If you play your leveling pandaren daily it's buff, since you get a days rested in 12 hours. If you just occasionally level him/her/it but spend all rested in one go this is a nerf since it caps at 150% rather than 300%</div></div><hr />

If you just occasionally level him/her/it but spend all rested in one go this is a nerf since it caps at 150% rather than 300%No, if you always spent your rested bonus in one play session it's neither a buff nor a nerf. You get the same amount of rested XP. If you almost never spent all your rested bonus, it's a buff, because you're now more likely to spend all your rested bonus.<br />
<br />
That it caps at 150% instead of 300% isn't a nerf, because you get twice the amount of bonus XP during this 150%.</div></div><hr />

So where is my money in this patch? I don't see the new dwarf model what kept promising for years... 5.4 is not my patch maybe I will come back if BC 2.0 expansion has come.</div></div><hr />

Scenarios destroy the community and connections between people... Most of the case 1 man do the whole scenario and the other two are just afk or haven't got any idea what is going on there. And I see many people haven't got enough skill or spells to solve alone these scenarios... 0 teamwork, just wasting time and get annoyed by other people.</div></div><hr />

It's a 30% nerf they are putting through for ret and prot only, for holy it will be the &quot;pre-nerf&quot; value, it is in the official patch notes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is that 30% revival nerf on top of last weeks 30% nerf? If it is, that's obscene.<br />

No it's just the nerf actually being put into the PTR build</div></div><hr />

Instead of new 5 mans, they want you to roam around some island for hours and hours, for a chance at loot and quest items. Sounds like a big pile of steamy poop to me</div></div><hr />

They still want people to gear from 476 Upwards it seems.</div></div><hr />

What's the value in adding 476 item level gear this far on into the expansion? I don't get it.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is keeping their progression path. If they added a new 5 man but still had it drop 463, nobody would want to do it. If they added it and it dropped 502+ nobody would do anything BUT it and skip the progression path that blizzard has forged the entire expansion. Toc, 5 man ICC's, and the troll dungeons were all just ways of skipping ahead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, how dumb can one be? That is the the 30% nerf from Blizzard's PTR patch notes. Not another nerf on top of a pervious nerf.<br />
<br />
Can't you tell the difference between the green and blue text?<br />
<br />
This is the kind of idiot Blizzard has to deal with from the community everyday...<br />

Vendor and shard fodder. Basically adds variety when you loot chests and NPCs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really, going from 1-80, the old racial was much better. But once you get to 85, this new racial will be superior, especially starting next expansion. Having 3 full levels of rested exp was pretty much wasted post-85 unless you were doing a marathon session of only dungeons.<br />

Dungeons destroy the community and connections between people... Most of the case 1 man dps the whole dungeon and the other two dps are just afk or haven't got any idea what is going on there. And I see many people haven't got enough skill or spells to solve alone these dungeons... 0 teamwork, just wasting time and get annoyed by other people.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly the case. I pug tank dungeons whenever CTA satchel is up. They are almost completely soloable right now as a geared tank. Usually, if I am lucky I get 1 dps who is actually doing a real rotation and decent dps... but most of the time, it is people who can barely run fast enough to keep up with the pulls.<br />
<br />
I don´t see how anyone can complain about scenarios being 1 person doing all the work and 2 people afking along when dungeons have been that way since about a month after launch. Scenarios are actually better because the lame dps can´t count on a tank doing all the work.<br />
<br />
I don´t hate dungeons or love scenarios.. but the ´participation´ required for them to be completed is probably higher for scenarios.</div></div><hr />

You need to read the original post, not the Anufis version... Scenarios are far worse than heroics.<br />
<br />
and the heroics loot-table could change. and nobody will skip those... that's so simple! OR like in old times change old valor items to justice items...<br />
On the new island will get annoyed by other people to get a chest with loot for hours or days... Solo gearing instead of team gearing... And this is an MMO?<br />
I hate when 10+ people are waiting for a rare re-spawn and they scold each other's family. And this is not the players fault... The game create these situations.</div></div><hr />
