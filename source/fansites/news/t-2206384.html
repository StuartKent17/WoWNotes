Pose with the Blues - April 21<br />
Join us tomorrow (Friday, April 21) on the Public Test Realms and show us your moves in the Trial of Style!<br />
<br />
From 2 to 4 PM Pacific time (5 to 7 PM Eastern), we’ll be donning our best outfits and strutting our stuff in the brand new Trial of Style event, which is coming in patch 7.2.5. If you’re able to stop by, we’d love for you to join us! Just download the PTR, copy your character, and find Flaskataur in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. He’ll have an option to queue for “Mog Week Tournament&quot; – select that, and you’re off!<br />
<br />
Note: due to the way PTR character copies work, you’ll most likely be missing some appearances on the PTR that you’ve unlocked on live realms. As the saying goes, “Make it work!”<br />
<br />
Of course, we’ll be participating as well. You’ll know you’re flexing for a Blizzard employee when you see someone in either the &lt;Blizzard Alliance&gt; or &lt;Blizzard Horde&gt; guilds.<br />
<br />
See you then!<br />
<br />

Anduin's Questline - Where's the Horde Part?<br />
The Anduin quest-line and cinematic is intended to tie together the loose ends with the leadership of the Alliance following the events of the Broken Shore in 7.0.<br />
<br />
It's aimed to be similar in nature to the second cinematic Horde players saw following the 7.0 introduction quests which solidified Sylvanas as the new Warchief of the Horde.<br />
<br />
We're forwarding on the feedback that Horde players are unhappy that Alliance players have a one time source of additional Artifact Power. Thanks for the feedback. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1059004-anduins-questline-wheres-the-horde-part/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17615462531?page=2#36))<br />

Affliction MG Changes - Some Transparency?<br />
We hear you all on Soul Effigy. We’re going to remove it in the next PTR patch. It’s concerning when the community sentiment towards a talent isn’t that it’s overpowered or underpowered, but that everyone is terrified they’re going to have to play that way if it becomes strong.<br />
<br />
It should be understandable how the original concept of Soul Effigy would seem fun in theory, despite it clearly not working out in practice. As an Affliction Warlock, I'm very happy to walk into a 2-target boss fight. At a basic level, you know you're going to get double value out of your DoTs. Walking into a 1-target fight with Soul Effigy just doesn't feel nearly the same. Mechanically, the gameplay of the two situations is very similar, but in the end Soul Effigy doesn't play out well. Could be any of a number of actors - the reduced damage transfer, feeling like the effigy is just there for increased soul shard generation, the usability issues, or the unnaturalness of it as a concept. <br />
<br />
Anyways, it’s gone. Replacement talent to come.<br />
Thanks for the comment Seph, can you clarify whether Affliction will be receiving the nerf to Soul Conduit or not? The notes said only demo was excluded from the SC nerf however on PTR the talent remains 20% for Aff (the tooltip at least, I have not tested the actual %).<br />
Soul Conduit should be unchanged for Affliction. Latest patch notes should reflect that.<br />
<br />
This is also further compounded by our current T20 set bonus, which puts a lot of emphasis on drain damage and complete drains - both of which are part of the MG play style, which was just effectively neutered.<br />
The Tier 20 set bonus for Affliction is changing soon. It won’t be so focused on Drain Soul. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1058954-affliction-mg-changes-some-transparency/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20754325347?page=8#154))<br />

As far as I know, pretty much her story is cutoff after the Stormheim questline. Why not continue her story as a Warchief and have her take some responsibility now that she is leader? Just because Anduin's storyline needed more fleshing out, doesnt mean the Horde cant have anything.</div></div><hr />

This I agree with, she was never a popular choice to many horde players. For years she's been painted as a self centred individual who cares about her own goals and nothing else yet suddenly Vol'jin's spooky ghost friends are all like &quot; Yeah make her warchief it'll be cool &quot; and nothing comes from it, thus far she's continued down her self centred path via the stormheim storyline even the dark mirror short story she continues to walk the same path.<br />
<br />
So far I still think she's a terrible warchief and I'm failing to see how &quot; She'll be the one to save us &quot; as said by Vol'jin unless she has more upcoming development she'll remain that self centred douchebag with no regard for anyone but herself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lol. Devs treating Horde players like crybabies for whining about a handful of AP.<br />
Brewfest Kodo, Bike competition, 5.3, shall I go on?<br />

I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting there's many examples of alliance players crying because they didn't get their own way and look how that turned out, they got the brewfest kodo, they got their bike and they got more development for characters, crying pays off, are you surprised it's happening now?</div></div><hr />

Most likely there is an issue with the spaghetti code WoW is built on. They can't even change the backpack size without messing with EVERY currency in the game.<br />
<br />
So wouldn't surprise me that it is near impossible to create guild halls, because of some code created 12 years ago, that now is too late to change because too much is built around/on it.<br />
<br />
Which is why they should kill WoW, and start with WoW2. New code and all that jazz, that is up to todays standards.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but if they can put us in unique guild chats they have a method to put us in guild halls. Especially if they can create garrisons for each unique player.</div></div><hr />

Dude .. did you ever code a bigger project with more then 5 people?<br />
<br />
Yes, the problem sounds so stupid and easy to fix, but it isn't. For the WoW Bag Problem, remember that this game was coded 15 years ago (before the release of course) and they used some other code from WC3 AFAIK. First off all, the coding philosophy was a bit different as of today and I guess nobody could foresee, that the game would still be running in 2017. Also we're talking here about a cluster ready game with million lines of code ... you won't believe what a mess a small change in one line of code can do in 200 other modules you never thought about being related in any way.<br />
<br />
It's not about the code or changes they made over the years, it's simply that the workload is enormous to read into and to do a QC. And they would change the whole function to a current date level, so additional changes can be done easily. And that is what makes it quite tricky.<br />
<br />
Btw. a new start wouldn't fix anything. They would need at least 5 years with an army of devs to get a new game to the current level we have today. They need to port the script engines, movements, AI etc. - not to mention the tons of textures etc.<br />
<br />
And even if they did it all anew ... it would fail like any other &quot;WoW-Killer&quot; that raised the past years. Just because you CAN'T compete with a game that is on the market for a fucking decade. The ppl tend to expect the same content and balance as WoW at least, and you can't get that with a new game.<br />
<br />
Same goes for Starcraft - they just released the first patch for a games that is ages old. Get yourself the Command &amp; Conquer Pack any you will see, how many issues there are. They will need some time to get the Game up to date and fix all the annoying bugs. Takes some time to get used to the program code, nobody worked on in the past several years. And first of all you need to find the guys, that actually CAN code for the game, without learning everything new.</div></div><hr />

Guild missions and the like where you go do raids or whatever. Can also put the trophies from raid bosses the guild defeated up. There are many options and it would give guilds a more significant feeling in game beyond being a group of people with a special chat. I get that it makes you salty I had a response to your first issue, but I'm not trying to debate this issue here.</div></div><hr />

Guild halls have been a thing since vanilla. Ever try to schedule an in-game guild meeting? We'd have to find obscure, out of the way places, so random people wouldn't run through, or run into the middle and disrupt. There's also the issue of displaying trophies, like the Garrison. Guild perks used to be a thing, they could add guildportals inside to whatever raids they're working on. They could put the guild bank interface there. There's tons of stuff they could add in there, that would be a benefit to guilds - something that they don't seem to care about anymore.<br />

That's exactly what they're doing - and this is all part of the big push for eSports. Free Starcraft means lots more people populating the ranks. Get 'em into competitive play, then get the upgrade cash to HD and Starcraft 2. Or that's what they hope. I can't imagine trying to compete against the zerg rush.</div></div><hr />

So.. you agree with what I posted. The code is too old to make huge changes now. No need to make a wall of text.<br />

What happens in the old world? Leveling? Mostly done through LFD now. Transmog farms? Sure some does it. Are you trying to tell me, that old zones got more than 2 people and 5 bots in them? <br />
That's how the game is, you progress, and old content become trivial and unimportant. Creating a new WoW wouldn't change anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As someone that actually goes into that content rather than sitting in cities/on forums , I see people out in the world all the time. I love how you try to excuse the people being there as &quot;bots&quot; though. NOTHING I've seen supports your claim. <br />
<br />
Again, you not seeing it =/= it doesn't happen. And what content is &quot;trivial&quot; and &quot;unimportant&quot;, is highly subjective. Not that I expect someone of your mindset to understand that. In order to make it relevant at max level, it'd be much more realistic to think that they'll utilize the new scaling tech than redo the game. <br />
<br />
They won't waste millions of dollars and risking alienating millions of players that have poured years into WoW in order to make a WoW2 for people that have grown tired of the current game. Especially when considering how WoW made them 800 thousand USD on a BAD year. As a fan of this game rather than some figment of imagination, I'm very happy about that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you also realize how many people would just simply quit? Having a WoW 2 would mean current WoW would start to die/not receive updates and in WoW 2 your progress wouldn't transfer over. It's essentially playing a whole new game. People aren't going to invest time and energy into something new just because some people felt they need to make a whole new game.<br />
<br />
If they were to somehow just update the game completely to a WoW2 during one of the expansions then that's one thing.</div></div><hr />
