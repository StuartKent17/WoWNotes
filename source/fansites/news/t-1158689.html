Terrace of Endless Spring: Tsulong<br />
Tsulong is the second boss in the Terrace of Endless Spring raid. This raid may be more difficult than the other two, as it requires you to complete Heart of Fear before entering. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Terrace of Endless Spring<br />
Straddling the mountain range between the Jade Forest and the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, the Terrace of Endless Spring has been a sacred refuge for millennia. Its peaceful fountains are said to have the power to heal and rejuvenate, but when the Sha of Fear attacked, many of the complex's guardians turned on each other in fits of terror.<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
<br />
Heroic: Tsulong (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/6732) - Defeat Tsulong in Terrace of Endless Spring on Heroic difficulty.<br />
Who's Got Two Green Thumbs? (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/6933) - Win the Tsulong encounter while keeping the Enchanted Plant alive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tsulong<br />
<br />
The Night - Tsulong struggles at Night with the Sha's corrupting influence. Bringing Tsulong's remaining health to zero while at Night permanently destroys the Sha's influence over him. When he reaches 100 energy, he temporarily purges the Sha's influence and radiant sunlight turns Night into Day.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png&quot; title=&quot;Important&quot; /&gt; Dread Shadows (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122768) - The Dread Shadows created by the Sha within Tsulong inflict 5,000 Shadow damage on all players and increases their Dread Shadows damage taken by 10%. This effect stacks.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/magic.png&quot; title=&quot;Magic&quot; /&gt; Nightmares (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122777) - The Sha within Tsulong projects Nightmares at the location of a random player. The Nightmares inflict 50,000 Shadow damage and fear players within 8 yards of the impact for 3 sec.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png&quot; title=&quot;Tank&quot; /&gt; Shadow Breath (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122752) - Tsulong expels out Sha energy in a 30 degree cone in front of him, inflicting 140,000 Shadow damage and increasing Shadow damage taken by 100% for 30 sec. This effect stacks.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png&quot; title=&quot;Important&quot; /&gt; Sunbeam (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122789) - Tsulong's attempts to resist the Sha allow him to protect the players from Dread Shadows. Tsulong summons a Sunbeam onto the battlefield, and the Sunbeam grants immunity to Dread Shadows for players standing within the beam. The protected area of the Sunbeam shrinks over time as more players stand within it.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/heroic.png&quot; title=&quot;Heroic&quot; /&gt; The Dark of Night (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/38307) - The Dark of Night appears at a random location and moves towards the nearest Sunbeam. The Dark of Night extinguishes a Sunbeam upon reaching it.<br />
<br />
The Day - During the Day, Tsulong gains the upper hand over the Sha corruption. Players may heal and aid Tsulong during the Day, and bringing him to full health while in the Day permanently destroys the Sha's influence over him. When he reaches 100 energy, the Sha corrupts his emotions and Night descends upon the Terrace.<br />
<br />
Embodied Terror - Embodied Terrors spawn as the Sha fights to control Tsulong. When players destroy an Embodied Terror, five Fright Spawns burst out.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/magic.png&quot; title=&quot;Magic&quot; /&gt; Terrorize (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123011) - The Embodied Terror casts Terrorize on both a random player and on Tsulong. The terror inflicts 10% of the player's current health as Shadow damage every 2 sec for 10 sec. Tsulong suffers 1% of his total health as Shadow damage every 1 sec. for 10 sec.<br />
<br />
Fright Spawn - Five Fright Spawns appear when players destroy an Embodied Terror.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/magic.png&quot; title=&quot;Magic&quot; /&gt; Fright (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123036) - A Fright Spawn unleashes a wave of Fright, inflicting 20,000 Shadow damage and fear on players within 30 yards for 2 sec.<br />
<br />
Unstable Sha - Unstable Sha appear around Tsulong and then move towards him, inflicting massive Shadow damage to Tsulong if they reach him.<br />
<br />
Unstable Bolt (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122881) - The Unstable Sha unleashes shadowy energy at a random player, inflicting 50,000 Shadow damage on the target. The Unstable Bolt also damages the Unstable Sha for 10% of its maximum health.<br />
Instability (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123697) - If an Unstable Sha reaches Tsulong, it inflicts 2,500,000 Shadow damage on Tsulong and disappears.<br />
<br />
Sun Breath (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122855) - Tsulong breathes out solar energy in a 60-degree cone in front of him, inflicting 4,000,000 Nature damage to Sha within 0 yards and stunning them for 8 sec. The breath also places the Bathed in Light effect on players within its area.<br />
<br />
Bathed in Light (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122858) - The warmth of the Sun instantly restores 25% of a player's total mana and increases their healing done by 500% for 15 sec.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/healer.png&quot; title=&quot;Healer&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/heroic.png&quot; title=&quot;Heroic&quot; /&gt; The Light of Day (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123716) - The Light of Day appears at a random location. Interacting with The Light of Day restores mana every 1 sec. and increases healing done by 3,000% for 30 sec. The amount of mana restored increases while the healing done decreases over the duration of the effect.<br />

Beta Class Balance Analysis<br />
Do the stats of temporary pets like Feral Spirits (ones that don't have a pet stats page) adjust dynamically according to thier master's stats? Or do they still take a &quot;snap shot&quot; of thier master's stats?<br />
They update dynamically now; no more “snapshotting” of stats. The next build you all get should have most of the pet scaling issues I’ve mentioned previously fixed, so if you see things that aren’t working right, try them out in the next build.<br />
<br />
Hi, I'd like to know what your stance on Vengeance affecting defensive abilities is. I remember Word of Glory during Cata specifically not being affected by Vengeance. Currently in MoP Expel Harm can go upwards of 120k~ non-crit, as well as other defensive abilities which are affected by Vengeance (Death Siphon, Lichborne Death Coil healing, Zen Sphere healing component, Shield Barrier). There are also others which are not (Anti-Magic Zone). Where do you draw the line? (list non exhaustive).<br />
<br />
Basically ,is it a bug that some only scale with AP from gear while others scale with Vengeace AP as well? If not, are there any that are scaling differently with Vengeance AP than they are with AP from gear? Eg. 1:1 scaling with gear from AP but 1:4 scaling with Vengeance AP?<br />
Vengeance should work just like any other AP buff. For tanks, we explicitly make certain abilities scale with AP, so that they do become stronger while tanking. I think the simplest example is Shield Block vs. Shield Barrier. We want Shield Block to generally win against hard hitting (such as raid boss) creatures, and Shield Barrier to win against weaker hitting creatures. But we don’t want that difference to be so stark that the other feels useless in either situation. Shield Block naturally scales with the incoming damage. We made Shield Barrier scale with AP, since we know that your AP is also going to be higher when fighting those harder hitting creatures, thanks to Vengeance. If something scales off for AP and isn’t counting Vengeance that sounds like a bug. The one you mention, Anti-Magic Zone, scales with 400% of Str for Blood / Frost and 325% for Unholy (to counteract the +25% Str that Unholy gets). We didn't want AMZ to be significantly stronger for Frost or Unholy, such that you're asked to switch specs just to bring a stronger cooldown.<br />
<br />
- Right now several Classes/Specs have extremely complicated AoE rotations, but do SIGNIFICANTLY LESS AoE damage than classes/specs that simply spam 1 or 2 abilities.<br />
It's fine for specs to have different sorts of AE mechanics, but the simpler ones shouldn't also do the most DPS. (Granted, &quot;DPS&quot; when referring to AE has a lot to do with duration, area and and number of targets.)<br />
<br />
Is it intended that the DR curve for dodge is 2-3x as punishing as for parry? In other words, is it intended that tanks are going to be stacking parry over dodge by a 3:1 ratio?<br />
Yes and no. Plate tanks now get a very significant amount of parry from Strength (the same amount that druids get dodge from Agility). So yes, plate tank parry is going to be significantly higher than their dodge. We want parry rating and dodge rating on gear to be of similar value, so we drastically eased the diminishing returns on parry for these classes. Saying that tanks are going to be “stacking parry over dodge by a 3:1 ratio” is probably exaggeration; we’re expecting you to naturally get Strength on gear, giving you the majority of your parry, and then favor parry rating and dodge rating roughly equally beyond that. There’s still some tweaking to be done to get that more tightly tuned (especially since our recent change to ratings of only needing ~85% as much rating to get the same result as before), but it’s in the right ballpark.<br />

Ouch, I was already fairly resource starved on the beta and figured this was (part) of the cause. If Rime no longer gives RP from it's HB, that's going to be super painful.<br />
At the risk of sounding pedantic, it’s always been this way. On live, you probably have the Chill of the Grave talent, which increases Howling Blast’s runic power generation by 10, making it 20 naturally and 10 with Rime. Without Chill of the Grave, it generates 10 naturally, and 0 with Rime, which is what you’re seeing on beta.<br />
<br />
Rune tap, and Death Pact (Possibly the whole level 60 tier of talents) are generating healing AE threat similar to that of regular healing. Is this intended? Seems rather odd, since the threat generated by the healing portion of death strike was removed. Both these healing abilities do generate AE threat on live as well, but they aren't modified by the thread modifier provided by blood presence like it does on beta.<br />
Probably not. We'll discuss those. Specifically, as the poster mentions, the issue isn't the heals causing threat. The issue is the heal threat being magnified for a tank, such that you risk asking the tank not to use their self-heal for fear of pulling stuff off of the other tank.<br />

Issue #1. Guardian dps seems to be EXTREMELY skewed towards mangle.<br />
Issue #2. Guardian dps is pretty overpowered. <br />
You are probably right on both counts. We'll look into it.<br />

Is it intended that the stacks of Mana Tea a Mistweaver Monk can gain from doing DPS in Stance of the Fierce Tiger will persist through stance changes, and is it intended that in periods of downtime Mistweaver Monks are to use this fact in order to build up a reserve of Mana Tea at no cost other than what it takes to consume the stacks when later needed?<br />
It's okay that the stacks persist, but you shouldn't be able to gain stacks in another stance.<br />
<br />
The majority of people feel it should be 10/sec regen rate as a base. Though, the developers fully intend to bring it down to 8/sec, despite us all agreeing how starved we feel.<br />
It's 8 for Windwalkers, with a +30% buff for Brewmasters to provide a 10.4 per second. The free Tiger Palms for Brewmasters (which you may or may not have yet - I can't remember) are intended to fill in for some of the down time.<br />

I heard that several new builds are coming for testing. Good, and I really hope judgement of the pure will be back in any form. This is NOT about we need a buff, and I don't care how you spin your balancing, this is about the character of Paladin class. I hope that judgement to be back into holy paladin rotation and giving an effect called judgement of the pure.<br />
Holy paladins being required to Judge was super controversial. I think we would cause a lot of unhappiness if we tried to bring it back. There are several talents that tie into using Judgment if you want to use it. We intend to handle the lower haste numbers by adding 10% spell haste into Seal of Insight.<br />

Call of the Elements and the ability to reset the cooldowns of SLT/MTT/HTT potentially twice in one fight is far too good for either of the other talents to match up with it.<br />
Call of the Elements resetting long cooldowns might give it too much synergy with other talents. We're considering having it effect fewer cooldowns but giving itself a shorter cooldown.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior))<br />
Revenge - 4.5 sec cooldown. Instantly attack an enemy and two additional enemies for X damage. If Revenge is on cooldown, a successful dodge or parry refreshes Revenge. Generates 10 Rage in Defensive Stance.<br />
We're going to try something like this (probably with a longer cooldown). It helps to cover up streaks of not getting to use Revenge. It does lose a tiny bit of the Revenge kit.<br />
<br />
Just looking to ask on your stance (no pun intended.. kinda) on prot warriors and Heroic Strike / Cleave.<br />
<br />
On live, I like where they stand, I use them frequently and am happy with that. On beta, they just arent worth using. Cleave itself hits for an astonishingly low amount, as with heroic strike. My main question is, are these abilities going to get buffed? Because even with the free heroic strike/cleave proc, It's just not worth using it over Devastate. I know that it's not exactly on the gcd, but to me it's just not worth hitting the button for the extremely poor output. You could argue 'free damage is free damage' and i'd be okay with that, but i'm sure there's something else you could say <br />
<br />
The rage cost on both the abilities on beta is SIGNIFICANTLY too high if the damage values are to stay the same.<br />
It would be nice to get back to actually using those abilities instead of blindly spamming Devastate.<br />
We are happy with the beta design for now. The idea is that we can't ask Prot warriors to spend Rage on offensive attacks if we are also asking them to spend resources on defensive abilities -- the defenses will just always win. The Ultimatum proc is there to let you use Heroic Strike and Cleave for free sometimes. When you aren't tanking (like you are solo or off-tanking) or when survival isn't a question (you're running an easier dungeon perhaps) then you can Heroic Strike instead of Shield Block or Barrier. As you point out, you can use Heroic Strike and Devastate at the same moment since they aren't on the same cooldown.<br />

Soul Reaper and Death Rune Fix<br />
Thanks for all of the feedback on this topic. No promises, but we're going to consider alternatives to Death Runes for Soul Reaper. Runic power is the most likely candidate. We'll see how it feels to us and gauge beta response. We'll probably keep Death Siphon and Necrotic Strike as Death Runes.<br />
<br />
We don't want to get in the habit of offering patch notes for unreleased beta builds, but it's regrettably been some time since we have been able to get a new build up, and we know this has been a passionate topic. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/229295-death-knight-soul-reaper-and-death-rune-fix/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6037333773?page=4#72))<br />
<br />
Content Consumption Speed and Difficulty<br />
My question still stands: We have 3 modes of the very same raid, 2 of these are easily accessible by the vast majority. Why is it necessary to ruin the third mode for the ones who enjoy it? It's not about elitism, it's about providing a satisfying and enjoyable experience for the hardcore players too.<br />
The &quot;why should we ruin this for the hardcore&quot; bit has been explained several posts ago (and in multiple ocasions). <br />
<br />
However, there's something this hardcore/casual attitude that hasn't been tackled at length on this thread. (Note: this is a bit of a rant, just my personal, and probably crazy, opinion.)<br />
<br />
Perhaps we should find a definition of what's a &quot;hardcore&quot; and a &quot;casual&quot; player (Hint: You'll probably have an easier time predicting the lottery numbers) that the community can agree on. It's an incredible tricky question. If we go by the &quot;classic definition&quot; (is there even one?) of the term, a hardcore player would be any person deeply interested in a game, usually with a very high level of play and understanding, and capable of devoting plenty of time to it. <br />
<br />
These days, I've seen it all, from players playing 5 hours a day, 5 days a week, claiming they're casual, to players playing 3 hours a day, 2 days a week, claiming they're hardcore. It obviously can't be that way for everyone. (And truth be told, in most cases I've seen the &quot;casual&quot; or &quot;hardcore&quot; word attached depending on which one would favour the argument that was being presented).<br />
<br />
If we go by this sort of &quot;classic definition&quot;, then it's very clear who's &quot;hardcore&quot; and who's not. And some people will be very close to that definition, but not close enough. Either because you can't devote enough time (which is completely fine), or because your group doesn't have that level of skill (which, again, is completely fine too). <br />
<br />
If we go by that &quot;classic definition&quot; of the term, then we could assume that hardcore players completed the raid relatively quick after the initial Heroic Madness kill and were not affected at all by the debuff.<br />
<br />
So, to me, the real question would be &quot;where do we stop considering players hardcore&quot;? But that's a debate that would probably never end...<br />
<br />
The point was that a lot of people(and thats just my claim) that perhaps dont fit the classic definition of hardcore(since they cant devote a million hours in a few weeks) feel that they were effectively(dont start the &quot;turn the Aspect-buff off&quot; discusion again please - it has been covered) robbed of the opportunity to complete the unnerfed content!<br />
<br />
Your answer to this group is to get classic hardcore or accept the conditions as they are?<br />
My answer to that group is that they can turn the debuff off. <br />
<br />
The answer to that is that they can't because of the realm race (or whichever), but in that case, at least to me, it sounds like the interest of that group doesn't lie on the challenge itself, as much as on finishing ahead of others (which is probably just as fun for some people). <br />
<br />
As long as the possibility to turn off the debuff exists, noone is being &quot;robbed&quot; of anything. The challenge is still there, if you and your guildmates want to do it.

25 Man Raid Incentives<br />
Are you guys planning to make some changes to the current 10/25man raid versions. Because right now, pretty much everyone are switching to 10man and that leaves 25man raids to certain death. Maybe make the achievements like they was in Wotlk - 10 and 25man versions. Also a good idea is to make some mounts/pets/titles drop/being earned only from 25mans.<br />
The devs don't have, at this time, any plans to incentivize 25-man raiding. They want to make 10 and 25-man raids close enough, so that you choose whatever you find more fun.

<br />
So, the fact that they will not play beta (Read: DEMO) and not pre-order the product, therefore lowering the chances that they will buy the end product is not the company's loss? Forgive, I thought gaming developers were out to make money and sell a product. These MMO &quot;Betas&quot; need to just be called what they are: Hype-making Demos, and do some open 'betas'.<br />
<br />
PS, Earthbound (Mother 2) is still one of the best RPGs I have ever played. So many memories.</div></div><hr />

It is beta, so damage is significantly reduced in order to test the actual mechanics of the fight. It seems Blizzard is going less for easy or hard fights to designing them to be fun. That should have been their focus from the start.</div></div><hr />

Well the people that just got the Beta keys last night won't be able to play until the July 20th weekend. If you pre purchase you will have had access to the last 2 BWE's and various stress tests<br />
<br />
I've played the last 2 Betas and the stress tests and It's the most fun I've had gaming in years. Won't get into great detail, but check out the Guild Wars 2 subforum on this site if you want some info on it.</div></div><hr />

Although, it looks like they relocated their offices. Last I knew, they were over closer to the Madison, AL border off US72, but now they're in the middle the city of Huntsville (not the surrounding area).</div></div><hr />

Are you guys planning to make some changes to the current 10/25man raid versions. Because right now, pretty much everyone are switching to 10man and that leaves 25man raids to certain death. Maybe make the achievements like they was in Wotlk - 10 and 25man versions. Also a good idea is to make some mounts/pets/titles drop/being earned only from 25mans.<br />
The devs don't have, at this time, any plans to incentivize 25-man raiding. They want to make 10 and 25-man raids close enough, so that you choose whatever you find more fun.<br />
<br />
Translation: Yes, we intend to kill 25man by slowly phasing it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in before:<br />
&quot;You do this for the challenge&quot; so does top guilds and they do get their achievement upheld (with time stamp adleast) If &quot;Challenge&quot; is enough reward for that then why do achievements exist to begin with? What stands in the way for blizz to make a new achi &quot;Heroic: Dragon Soul - Unnerfed/hardcore edition&quot;?<br />
&quot;Why do you care if someone else gets the achievement? It's just a game&quot; Same back to you. Why would YOU care if we get our own exclusive achievement? It's just a game after all am I right? <br />
<br />
Blizzard once said that they want to make game for everyone. That also includes those &quot;crazy elitist&quot; because like it or not, the also belong to this whole &quot;everyone&quot;. The burden of promise lies on them. <br />
<br />
Another thing about the whole Hardcore and Casuals issue. Whatever has been done it is clear that it didnt worked. Perhaps it didnt hit anyone yet but true solution to this is &quot;seperation&quot;. Hardcores dont want to do anything with &quot;terribads&quot; and Casuals dont want to do or share anything with those &quot;elitists&quot;. Do you keep two kids who hate each others toghether untill they rip themselves to shreds or do you grab them by their hands and leads them to their own seperate corner?</div></div><hr />

They aren't killing anything, it's the playerbase themselves who are doing the killing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This Draztal guy just doesn't get it. There's nothing wrong with 'casual' players not being able to complete heroic bosses. Casual player, by definition, shouldn't even care whether they do or not. They just play for fun and do whatever it is that they find enjoyable. Really the only group the debuff caters to is bad players that refuse to improve.<br />
<br />
What they should do, is incorporate a score system similar to what wowprogress does for your 1st boss kill. That way, the 'casual' players get the achievement eventually, and the hard core players can point to their score and have something to show for putting in the extra effort.<br />
<br />
Or even better, make any nerf debuff something that you have to turn on, not something that is on by default.</div></div><hr />
