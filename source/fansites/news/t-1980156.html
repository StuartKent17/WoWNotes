It gets moved to a talent so it's only an option for MM which is totally ok, no worries I understand some people want MM with a pet, all good so far. Blizzard states &quot;Since it will get moved to a talent, it will be competitive with the other two talents in the first tier.&quot; COOL, sounds good Blizzard! :) As a result, it becomes a talent in the first row and gets a buff to 35% damage. I guess the extra 5% damage buff must be the result of &quot;making it competitive&quot;, because to be honest, &quot;True Aim&quot; looks pretty amazing and when &quot;Lone Wolf was still passive, I was planning on taking &quot;True Aim&quot;. So far, everything looks great!<br />
<br />
Today, Lone Wolf now increases your damage by 20%, down from 35%. Now it gives less bonus damage then when it was just a MM passive. -.-</div></div><hr />

I wish Lone Wolf was reversed: Animal Bonding - You can now utilise Pets, etc. probably harder to balance but I wish the default was no pet for marks.</div></div><hr />

It's just numbers right now, why does the numbers matter in Alpha? 10%, 100%, 1000% means nothing in an Alpha, it's all subject to being tuned appropriately. Commenting on nerfs/buffs at this point isn't really helpful. Talking about the gameplay/mechanics is what matters, i.e passive vs talent.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, good point I suppose. Never thought about it that way.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Brokenly Epic&quot;<br />
What. I don't think &quot;Broken&quot; means what they think it means...<br />
<br />
the Ilvl achievements have always been a play on Words of the current content.<br />
<br />
We will be in the Broken Isle, thus Brokenly Epic.</div></div><hr />

That's a Demon Hunter glyph though, it's listed under Warlock for some reason (the actual consumable item says Class: Demon Hunter on it at least).</div></div><hr />
