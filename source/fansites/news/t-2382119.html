Seething Shore<br />
<br />
Seething Shore is now in the Random Battleground queue, starting at level 110.<br />
Mining an Azerite Node now awards 20 Honor (was 40 Honor).<br />
The A Good Start achievement now requires 25,000 Azerite (was 100,000 Azerite).<br />
The Blood and Sand achievement now displays correctly when linked in chat.<br />
The &quot;Thrust&quot; effect from the Rocket Parachute now has 4 charges (was 2 charges), allowing players to reach further areas when jumping from the airship.<br />
The geyser period of Azerite nodes is now extended to 30 seconds (was 20 seconds). This will give players more time to reach spawning Azerite nodes.<br />
The respawn time at the graveyard is now 20 seconds (was 15 seconds).<br />
The time to cap an Azerite node is increased to 7 seconds (was 6 seconds).<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: We’d like to thank you for all your feedback on this new Battleground. The adjustments above should alleviate some of its pacing issues, as well as bring its most-arduous achievement more in line with other battleground achievements.<br />

If you participated in Season 6, to ensure you receive the rewards that you’re due, please keep the following in mind:<br />
<br />
Refrain from transferring your character(s) to another realm or faction until after Legion Season 6 has ended.<br />
Legion Season 6 titles and mounts will be awarded approximately two weeks after the season ends.<br />

Does this mean we can buy the PvP sets with Marks of Honor for transmog purposes again? Or will that be many weeks later?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I'm on 80k so far, and its taken 5-6 days of playing about 25 hours total. Thats NOT a hard achievement to get. But 25k?! What the heck. The Prospector title will become way more common that Battlemaster/Kahn/Gorgeous.<br />
<br />
Yeah, ok that 1 individual achievement is way out of line with other BG achievements. But all other achievements needed towards the title are ridiculously easy to achieve. Even the 100 wins is easy considering a game at most lasts 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Honestly. I had 25k after playing that BG non-stop for about 10 hours. Would be nice to get something for the wasted 55k i've farmed. And I'm sure there are way more people who have farmed the full amount than my measly 80k<br />
<br />
Rant over.</div></div><hr />

You would need to cap azurite 1000 times in order to get it the old way. Compared to similar achievements in other bg's. That is a ludicrous requirement, especially since there are many moments where a teammate will cap the azerite before you do. And no, I highly doubt there were many players going for the meta right away (their hardly is are for any bg).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah. Other Bg's have more/harder achievements. 'A good start' balances it out. And like I also said, the 100 wins is so easy to get, the queue as alliance is almost instant and a game last max 10 mins.<br />
<br />
In this case, having 100k to collect makes 'A good start' still probably easier than winning 100 AV games or 100 IOC games. But 25k. Pft. Thats like trying to get 25 AV or IOC wins. Will take a full day to achieve. <br />
<br />
Meeeh.</div></div><hr />

I mean, it clearly wasn't just the brawl week. They specifically hotfixed the capturing to have lower honor. They wouldn't have put it in the notes if it were just a feature of brawls.</div></div><hr />

I think it's positive regardless, there is nothing wrong for a valuable game to not get any more content, since what matters is the quality of the content. and the game is quite enormous already.</div></div><hr />

If you win one Seething Shore game, that's 1500 score, 15x capture, 40(old)x15=600 honor. Yet I got over 1k (most of the time 1.2-1.4k) even by lose each time I played it. It was because of the Brawl event folks...</div></div><hr />

Its exactly the same as Always. Rewards will be determined after the season has ended.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your calculation is missing bonus honor when your team win the BG. It is 300 points for first time of the day or 150 points for subsequent win. This means a Horde team's victory get ~800 honor while Alliance get ~1200 honor<br />
You get 50% extra honor as Alliance, It is common for Horde team to win and still receive less Honor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldn't agree more with this. Never been I ever have such a quick queue on BG. Like 1 min pop, and not to mention the honor gain. It even motivate me to grind prestige level (got me 3 levels the whole last week). I was underestimating the hype, thinking it was meh since most of wow players are pve oriented anyway. But turn out the hype was real. I was thinking if the &quot;bugged&quot; honor gained applied to all BG, it'll encourage more people to do BG. At least for people who grind prestige.</div></div><hr />

Honor gain in the BG pool really needs to be somewhat balanced, otherwise you just curse even more if you get anything but the one that gives you so much more.</div></div><hr />

I cannot for the life of me understand that type of thinking. If you do not strive to beat the hardest current content, then what are you in this game for ? Pet Battles ?</div></div><hr />

I agree, and I think they should even drastically increase the honor gains for doing arenas and RBGs to help increase participation in them. I'm tired of fighting the same 2-3 teams over and over</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play the game for fun? I don't find cutting edge mythic raiding fun any longer so I don't spend time doing it; My guild still does but I do not partake. And to be completely honest there are people who play this game just for pet battles as ridiculous as that sounds. There are probably more players that play the game strictly for pet battles than mythic raiding lol.</div></div><hr />
