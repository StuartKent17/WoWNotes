The festivities have begun as the citizens of Azeroth and Outland celebrate the hottest of seasons by playing with fire all across these worlds! You'll want to take part no matter your experience or character level, as this is one of the most rewarding holiday events of the year. It's also one of the most PvP-heavy events, so strap into your gladiator gear and get ready to desecrate or defend the Midsummer bonfires.<br />
<br />
As with most holidays you'll want to stop by a capital city to begin the event’s main quests, including the ever-fun torch tossing challenges. While in each of the capital cities, be on the lookout for enemy players; stealing the flames from capital city bonfires is a necessary step in getting everything out of this once-a-year event.<br />
<br />
Ultimately you'll collect Burning Blossoms through your participation in these events, a special holiday currency you’ll then spend to purchase various items and pets available from the Midsummer suppliers and merchants.<br />
<br />
New or Leveling Players<br />
<br />
If you're not at max level yet you'll want to stop by the bonfires located near most towns and cities. By honoring the friendly bonfires, or desecrating the enemy faction bonfires, you'll be awarded a great deal of experience and gold. Be sure to use a Burning Blossom while at a bonfire to receive an hour-long critical strike buff to increase your damage output while questing. Relighting an extinguished bonfire will also grant a zone-wide buff that gives all players a bonus fire damage proc.<br />
<br />
Dancing around the ribbon pole at any friendly bonfire location will grant you a 10% bonus to XP for up to an hour (spin longer to increase the buff duration). Make sure you're stopping by as many locations as you can to honor or desecrate each bonfire, and keep the 10% bonus up to make leveling even faster.<br />
<br />
Be warned that desecrating enemy fires will flag you for PvP -- even if you play on a PvE server!<br />
<br />
Level 85<br />
<br />
The Frost Lord Ahune appears during the Midsummer Fire Festival, and max-level characters can use the Dungeon Finder to queue up for a chance to take on this holiday boss. Talk to Luma Cloudsister once you’re inside the instance to begin your quest to summon and defeat Ahune. If successful, he’ll drop one of five ilevel 353 cloaks (Icebound Cloak (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69770/icebound-cloak/), Shroud of Winter's Chill (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69768/shroud-of-winters-chill/), The Frost Lord's War Cloak (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69766/the-frost-lords-war-cloak/), The Frost Lord's Battle Shroud (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69767/the-frost-lords-battle-shroud/), Cloak of the Frigid Winds (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69769/cloak-of-the-frigid-winds/)), and very rarely a unique Formula: Enchant Weapon - Deathfrost (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/35498/formula-enchant-weapon-deathfrost/) weapon enchant recipe for enchanters. Players will also receive a Satchel of Chilled Goods (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/54536/satchel-of-chilled-goods/) for their first Ahune victory each day. These satchels contain Justice points, a very small chance at the Frostscythe of Lord Ahune (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69771/frostscythe-of-lord-ahune/), and an even smaller chance at an ice elemental non-combat pet (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/53641/ice-chip/). Although only one Satchel of Chilled Goods (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/54536/satchel-of-chilled-goods/) can be had per day per person, a group of five characters can summon and defeat Ahune five times in the same instance by each using their quest item to summon him.<br />
<br />
‘Til the Last Ember<br />
<br />
On July 4, players are invited to their faction’s capital cities to enjoy a fireworks display and toast the end of the Midsummer Fire Festival. Revelers will appear in the city streets looking for a /dance or /kiss, rewarding those that reciprocate with a limited-duration buff. Fireworks displays will start at 6:00 p.m. PDT and occur every hour on the hour until the end of the event.<br />

Shall We Play a “War” Game?<br />
Last December we introduced a new feature to World of Warcraft called War Games. This feature would provide players with the opportunity to face off in battles of epic proportions for fun and bragging rights. Arena teams and Battleground teams could meet up, pick their field of battle, and go toe-to-toe to hone their skills, see who was king (or queen) of the hill, and settle a score or two. While this was an exciting new feature, starting a War Game wasn’t as visible or easily accessible as we had wanted it to be. To address this issue, patch 4.2 implements a new interface option within the Player vs. Player (H) tab that makes it easier than ever to call out friend or foe for a face-off.<br />
<br />

<br />
To answer your burning questions, we’ve updated the FAQ below.<br />
<br />
Q: What's a War Game?<br />
A: A War Game is an unranked match in which one group of players challenges another group to an Arena or Battleground skirmish in a setting of their choosing. The leader of the group will be able to initiate a War Game by opening the Player vs. Player window (H) as explained below.<br />
<br />
Q: How does it work?<br />
A: After you've formed your group (a minimum number of party members is needed depending on the Battleground or Arena chosen), open the Player vs. Player window (H), and select the War Games tab. To start a War Game you must be the party leader, select a Battleground or Arena, target an opposing party leader, and click the Start War Game button.<br />
<br />
The other party leader will receive a pop-up notice stating &quot; has challenged you to a War Game in the .&quot;<br />
<br />
The challenged party leader then has a little over a minute to accept the challenge. Once he or she accepts, each group will be placed in the queue and will receive a pop-up window prompting them to enter the skirmish once it's ready.<br />
<br />
Q: Can I play War Game skirmishes against members of my own faction?<br />
A: Yes! The War Game skirmish system allows you to challenge players in your same faction to Arena and Battleground matches. You can also challenge those of the opposite faction.<br />
<br />
Q: What Battlegrounds and Arenas are available to play?<br />
A: Players can choose from the drop-down menu the following Battlegrounds and Arenas to play in:<br />
<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
10v10 (minimum 5v5)<br />
<br />
Warsong Gulch<br />
Twin Peaks<br />
Battle for Gilneas<br />
(Rated)Eye of the Storm<br />
<br />
15v15 (minimum 8v8)<br />
<br />
Arathi Basin<br />
Eye of the Storm<br />
Strand of the Ancients<br />
<br />
40v40 (minimum 10v10)<br />
<br />
Alterac Valley<br />
Isle of Conquest<br />
Random Battleground<br />
<br />
<br />
Arenas (2v2,3v3,5v5, minimum 2v2)<br />
<br />
Nagrand Arena<br />
Blade’s Edge Arena<br />
Ruins of Lordaeron<br />
Dalaran Sewers<br />
The Ring of Valor<br />
All Arenas<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Can I challenge a team from another realm to a skirmish?<br />
A: No, you can only challenge opponents on your own realm.<br />
<br />
Q: Can I start a game if one team has fewer group members than the other?<br />
A: You are able to create a Battleground War Game with uneven team sizes, but you are not able to create an Arena War Game with uneven team sizes. For example, an 8v5 Warsong Gulch War Game is possible, but launching an Arena War Game with uneven team sizes won't work.<br />
<br />
Q: What's the largest possible size for a War Game?<br />
A: Arena War Games can support up to 5v5 matches. Battleground group sizes are limited to the maximum number of participants each map normally allows.<br />
<br />
Q: Are any statistics recorded from War Game skirmishes?<br />
A: No, they work similarly to the old Arena skirmish system. Kills, damage, and healing are tracked and displayed at the end of the match, but wins and losses are not.<br />
<br />
Q: How long does it take for a War Game match to start?<br />
A: Once the challenge has been accepted, you will generally be through the queue in less than 30 seconds. War Games offer you a quick way to get into practice matches with other teams, test out potential recruits, or just have fun with your friends.<br />
<br />
Q: Can I receive achievements or guild experience in a War Game?<br />
A: Because you can pick who you play against, nothing is awarded for playing in these skirmishes -- except for the rush that comes with a hard-won victory, of course.<br />
<br />
Q: Do I get honor for killing players in a War Game Battleground?<br />
A: No. These are skirmish matches, so no honor is awarded for objectives or kills.<br />
<br />
Q: Why have you added this feature?<br />
A: Players have long been asking for a way to challenge specific teams, guildmates, friends, and rivals to skirmish matches in Arenas and Battlegrounds of their choosing. We hope you enjoy this new feature, and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!</div></div><hr />

You go to each enemy capital city, click on their bonfire and you get an item that starts a quest, much like quests you get that mobs drop. Once you've got all of them and handed them in, the quest giver will give one last quest, A Thief's Reward, which you complete on the spot and fills the criteria &quot;King of the Fire Festival&quot; which is the achievement for capturing your enemy's flame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I hope your chars are at least level 70, as it isn't exactly easy to get to the Darnassus and Exodar fires for Hordies [lvl 60 to fly in Azeroth plus some safety in terms of health to avoid getting one-shotted by guards], as unless I'm very much mistaken there is no survivable access to those places except by flying to Ru'Theran from Lor'danel, or to the Silvermoon fire for Allies (ever tried to out-run lvl 85 guards on a dismounted-and-caught-in-a-net, freshly rezzed clothie? Now's the time for that...). The Orgrimmar fire is also a bit nasty insofar as there's a Grunt within arrowshot distance guarding it who instantly aggros and one-shots every char with less than 6-8 k health... and the arrow is juuuuust fast enough in your heart so you're dead before you get the flame-item....<br />
<br />
Not to mention the health risks posed by dear fellow players who make a sport of hunting pvp-tagged members of the other faction who are obviously just there to do a festival achieve, but, kind of, &quot;wrong time for this&quot;...<br />
<br />
Oh, and don't forget: every extinguished enemy fire sets you on PVP for 5 minutes, until you cancel it, e.g. by getting on a &quot;taxi flight&quot;.<br />
<br />
One last note, some rather annoying fire location changes (probably incomplete list):<br />
<br />
Swamp of Sorrow -&gt; both factions at Bogpaddle.<br />
Badlands -&gt; east of New Kargath [Horde] and nw of Dragon's Mouth? Breath? Run? well, the Alliance flightpoint opposite New Kargath.<br />
Southern Barrens -&gt; there's a new Alliance fire in the (new) region; at one of the new flightpoints, obviously. (can't remember the name - sorry)<br />
Feralas -&gt; Alliance fire is still at Feathermoon (- something), but the new Feathermoon (-something).<br />
Ashenvale -&gt; Horde at Silverwing Refuge, Alliance at Forest Song</div></div><hr />

<br />
Given that the cloaks are available without having to have a certain gear level (like, say, the 4.1 Zul's' instances with avg. ilvl of 346 - I got my warrior into the encounter and his avg ilvl is around 334...), it is a step forward (albeit: a tiny one).<br />

Are you kidding me? <br />
PvPers get a new feature every expansion, and you complain?<br />

Which is a tiiiiiny % of the player base. So many more people used arena skirmishes. I don't believe Blizzard when they say it was unpopular. From all the instant queue pops with all the random people I got throughout WotLK, I can see that they were, in fact, very popular.</div></div><hr />

I'm stuck on 7/12 myself simply because I stopped playing in February and came back in May. Other than that, Pvp is repetitive so I can understand the new features but even those will become boring. And besides, it's not like it takes any real skill. Your addons do mostly all the work and you just dance around people while spamming cooldowns and attacks. If you really want a skillful pvp based game try black ops or gears of war. At least those require thumb movement and compensation for lag. On another note, I am very disappointed that the new tanking cloak from Ahune isn't better than the reputation vendor one, but in a week it will all be irrelevant anyway.</div></div><hr />

Nah, don't really pvp in WoW. Although when WotLK came out, I went out on a mission to get a low 2v2 score with my DK tank and a Prot Warrior + motorcycle (had it's own health at the time). <br />

We hit a 430 rating at the end, but 30+ minute matches got a little tedious.</div></div><hr />

It's remarkably hypocritical of you to mention time spent raiding when you've more than likely spent more than 30 hours in arenas and bg's. <br />

The hassle of dealing with them is only worth it if you want the pet too. A blue on the official forums stated the devs didn't want the staff to outshine one from the heroics, and the cloaks are worse than the ones you get off the VP vendor. So very few people even have a reason to get them (only if they haven't geared their alts.)</div></div><hr />
