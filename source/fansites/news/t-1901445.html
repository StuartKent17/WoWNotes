No TF should not be a toy... same reason as you can't xmog it. However wouldn't mind if they made the other 3 things toy related :/.</div></div><hr />

The Thunderfury can't be permanent because it would kinda decredit those who actually farmed it, and it would give more reward than farming it (Able to use it as technically transmog).<br />
<br />
The Edwin costume should of been a toy though instead.</div></div><hr />

The more you get, the more you expect next year. Is that what you told Santa when he came to you during X-Mass? Or did you accept any present and were happy. I wish aswell it was pet or mount as I collect them but actually most people learn new mount/pet and never use it - see the core hound (that I never see anyone using and its been whole expansion with no flying).

<br />
A more appropriate situation is you being a wife in an 11 year old relationship where your husband (Blizzard) gave you some great times at the start, and continue to try to do that as the years go by, but try as he might, he's not able to satisfy you because the spark just isn't there anymore, and yet you just keep bitching and hoping he can pull a miracle out of his ass to reignite the relationship even though he's still mostly the same guy (game) as before doing his best to improve for someone like you.<br />
<br />
I suggest you either get a divorce (quit) or cheat on him (go play something else) instead of constantly hoping that you will somehow fall in love with the same man (game) again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thunderfury makes sense to have the charges because if it didn't it would just become extremely common to see all of the players in a raid with it on, which is exactly what Blizz tries to avoid by making legendaries not transmoggable. Especially that one being that its a one hander that is bigger than any 2 handers and happens to be visually interesting.<br />
<br />
The costume on the other hand makes no sense having charges. Just make it last 10-15 minutes instead of an hour and make it a freaking toy. Most of the people saying we should be happy with what we got, how hard is it for them to change it into a toy that is permanent when the item itself already exists? They did it with plenty of items early on in the expansion so I imagine it's not particularly difficult.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I'm sure my main has a few cool items with charges that I've never used, sitting in my bank. Not because I don't want to use them, but I don't want the item to be &quot;wasted&quot;.</div></div><hr />

You don't have to be subbed to get these, you can get them on f2p account or veteran account. That may not mean much for the items but the achieve is account wide so yeah.</div></div><hr />

Oh man, I'm super happy these are all things that have a pointless handful of charges on them, if they didn't I'd actually feel like I'd want to resub to acquire them for a permanent thing I might miss. As it stands making the fun thing a thing I'd never use because of how rare the charges are means I don't even need to get them, which means I don't have to resub or provide any further money for this shit expansion. This is great! I'm super happy about this, only idiots are subbed right now and it's now a way to identify idiots in the future!<br />
<br />
And how much of an idiot must one be to not grasp the concept of subjectivity...? I can tell you, a MASSIVE idiot.<br />
<br />
You not having a reason for being subbed, doesn't mean there aren't any. Your OPINIONS aren't important enough to dictate reality, you know.</div></div><hr />

Reading the comments section took me back about 22 years, when I was in kindergarten and kids were crying and wailing for trivial reasons. Do you guys even know what &quot;milestone&quot; means? The most often socially acceptable milestones are marked every 5 years, so at 5 there was the whelping and at 10 years the MC mount and pet. At 15 we can expect another permanent pet/mount/toy. Until then please deal with the fact that you cannot be pleased, quietly.</div></div><hr />

They should have just made the inflatable Thunderfury a toy with a really long cooldown like 24 or maybe even 48 hours or something, so people won't just always have them equipped (because muh immersions!) but they can actually serve as a fun anniversary gift that keeps on giving.</div></div><hr />

It's actually ironic when you think about it, they liken fans to domestic abuse victims, yet they themselves hanging around a forum dedicated to something they hate and feeling the need to CONSTANTLY post about how much they dislike it actually lends to them being more like some sort of pathetic Victim who can't quite move on with their life and needs to constantly try to harass people that still enjoy it.

Because you can make a pet and put it into the Blizzard Store and get more money instead.<br />
<br />
Now, since most of the players quit the game and Blizz gets more money from &quot;free to play&quot; Hearthstone (which requires less work) than WoW, whats the point in making free pets while you can make ones that players can buy in the store? They don't care about this game anymore, haven't you noticed yet? One year ago they told you that there will be only 2 raid contents in every expansion to make expansions faster. Now you have to wait another year without new content anyway lol :P I am pretty sure that Legion will suck as much ad WoD does.<br />

Ah I'm so glad that I quit this game at the begining of WoD since every MMO-champ news I read since then make me laugh.</div></div><hr />

The more you get, the more you expect next year. Is that what you told Santa when he came to you during X-Mass? Or did you accept any present and were happy. I wish aswell it was pet or mount as I collect them but actually most people learn new mount/pet and never use it - see the core hound (that I never see anyone using and its been whole expansion with no flying). Some anniversiaries have been way thiner on gifts so its quite a lot of fun things this time.<br />

Reminds me of Dudley in Harry Potter when he threatens to throw a tantrum because there's two less birthday presents than last year...<br />

Actually it seems that you do. The mail system is inactive on unsubbed accounts. The achievement doesn't generate either, tested it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Abusing alts? lol ... the war on alts continues via fan sites. <br />
<br />
want to stop the alt abuse for good? take away 10 slots.</div></div><hr />

But I don't even understand the point of that hotfix. How is getting more charges of something from your alts abuse? Are they worried about somebody crying a year from now because you still have an inflatable thunderfury and they don't lol...... #fixingwhatisntbroken</div></div><hr />

Did you already forget about what we got with the 10th anniversary? I'd rank a raid with a mount, pet, and enchant transmog and BG with a title, both with accompanying FoS's above a few non-toy toys...</div></div><hr />

People really expect that each year? It was their TENTH ANNIVERSARY FFS. Of course they're going to make it a huge event. 11 is a nothing year. People really expect a mount or pet just for logging in each year? <br />
<br />
I'm by no means Blizzard biggest fan AT ALL at the moment but everyone complaining about this is embarrassing.</div></div><hr />

There's no point in defending Blizzard for lack of content when they don't have a leg to stand on. Yes it was the 10th anniversary. But no, they aren't exactly pushed for time at the moment because they aren't pushing out any worth while content!<br />
<br />
Do you think they COULD have made more content for the anniversary? Yes or no?</div></div><hr />

Well, y'know, so long as you don't count that whole thing about AN ENTIRE NEW EXPANSION they're working on adding sometime in the next few months...</div></div><hr />

You mean that &quot;ENTIRE NEW EXPANSION&quot; that we won't see for at least six more months leaving us with nothing to do? Oh yeah, we should be really grateful for that.</div></div><hr />

They lost 5million subs in six months, between this and the Legion Digital Deluxe non flyimg mount is an insult. They should be giving out rewards. People were spamming alts to collect them so they could have years of enjoyment out of them. They stealthed nerfed them, now loads of people either have a 1-2 on their main, which will never be get used to keep them. Or tons on banks alts that will not get used because no one plays on banks alts!<br />
<br />
Its fucking stupid!</div></div><hr />

These last six months have given me a lot of hope in Blizzard. It's like they are listening again. I miss this. We don't need a pet or mount every year, but something fun like these items feels good.<br />
<br />
My only qualm is that the Thunderfury item isn't a toy. Maybe they can adjust it in the future, like the Winter's Veil items.<br />
<br />
They have been listening before wod too:D</div></div><hr />
