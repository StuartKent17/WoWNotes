PvP<br />
Tanking/Protection specs in Arena<br />
We want the Protection specs to have a place in Arena play, but to be frank, it's not our highest priority. Our sense is that most players who chose Protection chose it for tanking.<br />
<br />
We don't want Protection dps to be trivial, but we also don't want it to rival that of say mages and rogues even in PvP. A Protection class in PvP should be more about survival and control, not about massive damage. With the added focus on BGs in Cataclysm, the tanking specs will be good at flag defense or flag-carrying, which suits their strengths.<br />
<br />
The Vengeance mechanic is a way to help us balance tank damage. It can be as high as it needs to be in PvE, while much lower and most-importantly dispellable in PvP. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262387168/protection-pvp-specs-cataclysm-mastery/))<br />
<br />
PvP Balance and counter abilities<br />
We think class design in WoW has reached what I often call an arms race in PvP. That is a class gains a snare, then another class gains the ability to break snares, so the first class also gains a root, then the second class gets an ability to break roots, and so it goes. Players tend to ask for abilities or talents that reduce their weaknesses, but when we go there, then someone else's strength isn't a strength any longer.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, having abilities and counter abilities adds depth to the fights. You need to be familiar with your defenses and everyone else's as well and need to decide, often in a split-second, when to use an ability or save it.<br />
<br />
But on the other hand, it justs adds bulk to the game. Simple outcomes can have depth too.<br />
<br />
I say all that as way of preamble, because we are taking a really hard look at a lot of the ubiquitous PvP-survival talents, such as those that reduce mechanic durations, provide pushback resistance, let you take less damage while stunned, etc. Our sense is that because so many of these have become ubiquitous, PvP is balanced around the assumption of those mechanics. Instead of them being some cool or clever power you have to mitigate their effects, they are just the norm. They become not a choice, but mandatory.<br />
<br />
It's likely you'll start seeing a lot of these counter mechanics getting phased out. We may not be able to get rid of every one, but we can get rid of a lot of them. Warriors may freak out when they think they will be CC'd permanently, but then they will start to relax when they see everyone is losing those mechanics and we take a hard look at the CCs themselves knowing that the passive and active CC counters are no longer in play.

<br />
Healing and dispells in Cataclysm<br />
For starters, dispels themselves are going to have higher mana and situational costs. I don't anticipate every hot is just going to be automatically removed.<br />
<br />
The reduction talents are something we are taking a look at. We don't want healers to have to spend talent points on them, which means either everyone will get the now standard reduction across the board, or we'll just remove them from everyone and balance interrupts around that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626578572/why-can-t-there-be-a-lesser-of-two-evils/))<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
Healing in Cataclysm<br />
Prior to LK, healers could run out of mana, and for the most part it worked. They didn't just use their efficient heals, because sometimes their group would die if they did. They didn't just use their big heals though, because they'd run out of mana (and then the group would die).<br />
<br />
I think of healing like a cross-continental road race. If you go too slow, you'll lose the race, but if you just floor it the whole itme, you'll run out of fuel a lot and waste time stopping to fill it up again. There is a happy medium somewhere in between. However the encounter specifics push you out of that medium, sometimes asking you to choose big numbers over efficiency and sometimes vice-versa.<br />
<br />
I know it sounds like we are picking on healers all the time, but once you can run out of mana again, I think everything will just feel better, your choices about what spell to cast next become more compelling, and the healing game overall will be more engaging. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25712373933/healing-model-wont-work-with-out-fixed-pools/))<br />
<br />
Overhealing<br />
I'm not convinced healers will leave tanks at half health on purpose. That wasn't a popular strategy in say Black Temple or Sunwell when mana was more of an issue. You may not be pressured to immediately top off a tank constantly, but leaving a tank purposefully injured in order to prevent overhealing isn't going to be a sound strategy. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626187952/future-of-prot-warriors/))<br />
<br />
Coordination<br />
I would put hots on people who need healing but aren't likely to die in the next few seconds. I understand there is still a lot of concern about &quot;but he will ninja my heal!&quot; but that is today's world where wasted mana doesn't matter. If you're on challenging content and your healers can't coordinate, then that's something your group will need to resolve. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626578572/why-can-t-there-be-a-lesser-of-two-evils/))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/cons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / 3.3.5 Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=.9dw.druid))<br />
Restoration in Cataclysm<br />
I wouldn't use Healing Touch that much in a 5-player dungeon. It's slow and expensive and heals for a lot, and you really don't want to be overhealing a lot in Cataclysm. Maybe if the tank has been whittled down and you just can't catch up, you could throw it out there. For the most part, I would use Rejuv and Nourish to heal the group and Lifebloom and Nourish to heal the tank, throwing out Swiftmend or Regrowth for emergencies.<br />
<br />
We want Wild Growth (and Circle of Healing) to be really good spells, but it's hard to keep them in that niche without them just being used every time they are off cooldown. High mana costs are supposed to make you ask yourself: Am I hitting Wild Growth to heal 2 people just because it's an easy / lazy thing to do?<br />
<br />
The limit-one Lifebloom is our attempt to make the spell a really useful tank-healing tool again. It's just too easy to keep an instant spell up on lots of targets, yet this is one case where we don't want the mana cost to be excessive. We also have a mechanic to let a stack of Lifebloom be refreshed by Nourish -- without this mechanic, druids just don't have the GCDs to do much more than keep hots up on tank and avoid any spell with a cast time. But if you could keep stacks on multiple targets so easily, druid would be too powerful at healing.<br />
<br />
We know making this change to Lifebloom will have PvP ramifications, but we're also okay with that. We need to shift PvP healing (for everyone) back towards cast time spells. When PvP healing is balanced around heals that can't be interrupted and can be cast on the move, then we have to do crazy things to give your opponents any chance to counter them. Resto druids have had a storied history of being overpowered or underpowered in PvP and we want to avoid these extremes. You'll still be casting hots, but you'll be casting non-hots as well.<br />
<br />
It's all early in development though and we haven't done a lot of PvP balance testing yet, so this design will evolve over time. Resto druids have a lot of spells, some of which have very subtle niches. Our initial strategy is to try and find homes for them all, because we like the spells. But if we can't make it work, we'll start cutting some. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626578572/why-can-t-there-be-a-lesser-of-two-evils/))<br />
<br />
Healing with HoTs only<br />
It's an apt comparison because we see Affliction locks all the time who say &quot;I only want to cast dots. Any time I cast Shadow Bolt, that's an abomination.&quot; But we want Affliction casting Shadow Bolt. Casting Shadow Bolt doesn't mean casting nothing but Shadow Bolt. Likewise, we want druids to cast Nourish and Healing Touch and not just keeping Rejuvs on everyone.<br />
<br />
Classes can feel different from each other without being so unique that they have nothing in common with each other. If you're going to invest many hours healing on a druid, it's more important to us that what you're doing is dynamic and engaging over the long haul. You'll notice that a lot more than you will how similar or dissimilar you are to the healer standing next to you. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626578572/why-can-t-there-be-a-lesser-of-two-evils/))<br />
<br />
lol-heals (I like the name!)<br />
The vanilla druid used a single heal for the most part, Healing Touch, so I don't find your analogy apt. What we are trying to do is give druids more heals than ever rather than having the overpowered heals vs. the lol heals. Using more cast-time heals does not mean removing the &quot;hot flavor&quot; of druids, unless your definition is &quot;I only hot.&quot; Referring to my previous post, we don't think the game design will work for *any* class that relies so much on a single category of spells. It barely works for mages because they have so many mechanics to support those few spells, but even in that example we are expanding their repertoire.

Spamming Power Word: Shield<br />
Pre-shielding when you know big damage is on the way for select targets is fine. Trying to keep shields up on the entire raid is a strategy that we think A) is too good, and B) isn't fun. I think a lot of the players who think it is fun feel that way because it's overpowered, not because it's a really engaging activity. When your decision making consists of cycling through targets and casting PW:S on any target without Weakened Soul, then you aren't really responding to the encounter -- you're acting like a glorified macro. Now maybe some of you will argue that you take a lot more into consideration before executing a pre-heal, but the fact is that Disc priests can be unbelievably effective without doing so. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626107959/save-power-word-shield/))<br />
<br />
Power Word: Shield in Cataclysm<br />
An Icecrown parse for a Disc priest might have PW: Shield (including its glyph) and Divine Aegis at 80% of healing done. Imagine that is more like 50 or 60% of healing done. That's still a lot of power for shields. The remainder would be filled in by spells like Penance, PoM, Heal and Greater Heal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626107959/save-power-word-shield/))<br />
<br />
Improved Flash Heal<br />
We have a talent, Improved Flash Heal, that does nothing else except buff flash heal. - a spell we won't likely use - Are you going to keep that talent?<br />
I would suspect not. We tried to pump up Flash Heal for Disc before because it was the only cast-time heal that really mattered. In Cataclysm, it is basically an emergency heal, which is something PW:S and Penance already do well. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626107959/save-power-word-shield/))<br />

Rockbiter taunt effect<br />
Avoiding a wipe is the responsibility of everyone in the group. If you don't think you'll use the ability, don't use it. Simple as that. You don't even have to spend talent points to get it.<br />
<br />
Hunters and demons have pets that are designed to tank. That doesn't mean they are a tanking class. Shaman will tank on rare occasions, just as warlocks and hunters are sometimes called upon to tank. That doesn't mean they will be able to choose the tank role in Dungeon Finder or will be very effective trying to be the MT for a group. As far as tanking classes go, there are four: warrior, paladin, druid and death knight. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626345750/shaman-intended-to-tank-in-cata/))<br />

Titan's Grip ...<br />
The budget of Titan's Grip or the fact that it's passive don't bother us at all. It's still an interesting talent in that it has a pretty big impact on how you play. If you doubt that, consider instead how it would feel if the talent gave you a damage bonus when using two one-handed axes rather than using two two-handed weapons. Everything from the swing speed to the stat budget is what makes the talent feel like it's breaking the rules. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626348133/titan-s-grip-vs-smf-issues-ahoy/))<br />
<br />
... and Single-Minded Fury<br />
I don't think Single-Minded Fury needs to be exactly as powerful as Titan's Grip at every gear level and in every situation. It needs to be balanced at very high or best-in-slot gear levels, or it will just get ignored. But at lower levels, I'm not convinced it will be a problem. Say it is proven that Titan's Grip wins hands-down at the pre-heroic dungeon level. Now a warrior runs a level 85 dungeon and a blue one-handed Strength weapon drops that is a big upgrade over his quest green two-handed weapon. Even though Titan's Grip is theoretically stronger with equal gear, he doesn't have equal gear. He has a one-handed upgrade.<br />
<br />
We might have to keep tweaking one talent or the other to keep them in rough parity, but those are relatively easy knobs to adjust. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626348133/titan-s-grip-vs-smf-issues-ahoy/))<br />

Healing in Cataclysm<br />
Prior to LK, healers could run out of mana, and for the most part it worked. They didn't just use their efficient heals, because sometimes their group would die if they did. They didn't just use their big heals though, because they'd run out of mana (and then the group would die).&quot;<br />

I wonder how this is going to work out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will be interesting to see abit more of them once the beta is in full swing.<br />
<br />
The 5man instance looks pretty good, I like the whole idea of bringing kiting back into the game, as adds abit more than just pew pew boss now give loots!. I do agree with the chap/chapette who mentioned about them being nerfed at somepoint.<br />
<br />
I must admit im getting abit excited now about cata, its took a while for it to &quot;sink&quot; in but bring it on!<br />

I totally agree with the disc priest section.<br />
My priest is my alt, but every raid I do with her they force me to go discipline which I really hate.<br />
It's fun in pvp, but it's the most boring spec I've ever played in a raid. Shield everyone and use PoM when available, flash heal and penance if people go low. /yawn<br />
<br />
My guild doesn't seem to like it, but I much much prefer holy. <br />
I love how versatile I am, these aren't my words, but I highly agree with them.<br />
I'm 2nd best in everything, I'm not a tank healer, but I have a lot of spells I can use to do so (RS p3, heroics and ToGC 10 for example, but your mileage may vary). Same goes for raid healing, spikey damage on random players is taken care of completly differently from high pulse AoE damage, and I have multiple ways to handle AoE. I can be resto druidish and blanket the raid with renew, or use PoM/CoH/PoH.. or a combination, while still having surge of light procs.<br />
<br />
That's fun and although my experience with other classes isn't to great, I find holy priests one of the, if not the most fun class/spec there is.</div></div><hr />

I got asked to tank a dozen times while leveling through pat Zul'Farrak. I've even tanked through half of HHoL when the tank DC'd and the rest of the group was &quot;GO!&quot; so I was like... ok.

<br />
Because how can you possibly be a good raider, if the training content is too easy for you to learn anything in?<br />
<br />
That and raiders also have to do 5-mans from time to time and we'd prefer they not suck, particularly considering Blizzard's insistence that in order to get raiding gear as fast as possible, you must do at least 1 daily heroic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) As many have commented, its more likely than not that these levelling dungeons will all be nerfed to the ground because of the culture of LK expansion.<br />
<br />
It is not enough for Blizzard to be highly inventive and re-introduce the original fun of the PvE game by bringing back playstyles like CC, kiting, risk of OOM. These playstyles have to be practised to be effective. What better way to practise than while levelling? <br />
<br />
Blizzard themselves have to simultaneously internally accept the game has to be &quot;harder&quot;/more involving throughout all their departments (including marketing) and also convince the section of the community who have been brought up entirely on LK. That is there is an internal culture change required as well as external one. Good luck with that! It's much easier to nerf or stealth nerf a tiny bit of content at a time, gradually adding up to a copy-cat LK experience or worse, than it is to change cultures.<br />
<br />
2) It looks like the impact of all the healing changes will be felt much more heavily on druids than any other of the healing classes. Not only will mana costs go through the roof across the board (except relatively less for Lifebloom which is now limited to one target), but healing on the move via cheap instants will be greatly reduced, movement with a healing and anti-CC buff will disappear due to the new ToL changes, aoe healing will use up even more mana to prevent a return to LK Rejuv-Wild Growth overuse for all situations, use of cast-time heals will be required making druid healing much slower and interruptible. Combined with haste stat scaling being changed across the board for all classes to prevent approaching caps that cause GCD issues, druid healing will be a vastly different beast compared to where it is now. You could argue its a &quot;return&quot; to pre-LK, but that is a LONG way from where we are now. In a sense, druids lose most of their niche and instead become limited priests with a few lol-utilities in Cata as well as with high risk of additional changes to inevitably balance them as the expansion develops.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, when I played, I did used to heal for a long time very successfully almost exclusively with Regrowth, Rejuvenation, Lifebloom, Swiftmend, Nourish (in that order), compared to the modern day Rejuv-WG bots. But that playstyle was largely forced out by changes Blizzard themselves introduced (set bonuses, Lifebloom nerfs and idols) as well as high end raiding guilds not accepting anything less than Rejuv-WG bots for the infinite-mana raid-wide healing niche.<br />
<br />
Tbh, if I return to the game as a healer, I will be much more interested in playing on my priest which almost by definition has to have the ability to heal in all ways. Oddly enough this means not only less changes to the overall priest playstyle compared to niche healers but also more stability in future because there will always be someway to heal that is effective on the priest, as the reference healer, regardless of Blizzard nerfs or changes. And yes, with two healing specs the Priest is the reference healer, before you argue! :)<br />
<br />
Paladin healing also looks highly attractive because it is clear Blizzard has realised they cannot re-introduce the risk of OOM to tank healers as well as have challenging content (certainly at least not for 5-man dungeons and possibly 10-mans). Risk of OOM could be spread out across tank healers in 25-man raids. Due to changes to Beacon this could require a lot more tank healer coordination. However, paladins and (holy) priests already have nice synergy when working as a group (see the Paragon guild almost exclusive paladin healing setup for the H-LK-25man world first kill). So, there is a low risk of Blizzard breaking this synergy and could even improve on it simply because it may be the only way to have the most challenging content. It is either that or equalize healing playstyles for all classes or break existing synergies between the same class and introduce completely new ones between classes...The latter is much harder work just to develop and hugely harder to test and balance around with each additional class.<br />
<br />
TL;DR. Thanks for the vids! And from Blizzard posts, priest or paladin healing look much more attractive and stable than druid healing in Cataclysm. Shaman healing is an unknown and therefore more risky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly the same as a higher level player since it's like a rogues' energy. It doesn't work like mana where the quantity of it increases over time. Your amount of focus will stay the same (unless talented for more), as will your regen (unless talented/aspected).</div></div><hr />

I believe they've said that the rate of focus regen will be increased by haste rating, which you won't have any of at level 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
true, so in other words as your haste goes up so does your focus regeneration and even if its low at low levels its not like it makes leveling a pain since steady shot deals relative damage at no focus cost.</div></div><hr />

You also get Aspect of the Fox, which allows you to regenerate focus 20% faster and auto shot while moving.<br />
<br />
I love kneejerk reactions. THAT LEVEL 5 HUNTER ISN'T REGENERATING FOCUS FAST ENOUGH WITH HIS 3 ABILITIES. I CAN USE MY SPACE-BRAIN KNOWLEDGE TO TRANSLATE THAT TO MEAN MY 85 HUNTER WONT DO AS MUCH DPS AS OTHER CLASSES. BLIZZARD HAS CONSPIRICIFIED TO STOP MY EPIKNESS!<br />
<br />
Reading blueposts is funzies:<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunters will no longer use mana; instead the class will use Focus. Focus generates much like Energy, by building up. It will not be affected by Intellect at all. Haste will improve its generation. Hunters will generate roughly 6 Focus per second, slightly less than rogues' Energy generation rate of around 10 Energy per second. Below, we have listed some examples of how we intend Focus costs to operate:<br />
<br />
Steady Shot/Cobra Shot: No cost. Generates 9 Focus per shot (or 12 per second instead of 6).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why are people stuck on the fact that the goblin area took him 15 or 20 mins more to level to 6? Getting to 85 is around 200 hours probably i dont think a .0125 % increase in time is really that big a difference to pay for getting the awesomeness of horde.<br />
<br />
Also the new instances look cool. Im sure that they will be quite a painful process with pugs to start but that the community will relearn cc, kiting focus fire etc and they will become easier. Hopefully it will also make us wipe quite a bit to start and people will also not leave after one wipe anywhere.</div></div><hr />

First, tanking before defense matters is irrelevant.<br />

<br />
I'll define &quot;like&quot; for you: Certain features and/or aspects of energy are similar (where 'similar' may or may not mean '100% the same') to focus.<br />
<br />
And there we go; Focus can be called focus even while being 'like' energy.<br />
<br />
Anyway...<br />
<br />
<br />
I believe they've said that the rate of focus regen will be increased by haste rating, which you won't have any of at level 1.<br />

Thanks for that, I missed it. Guess my comment is not entirely accurate then.<br />

LOL i remember doing BM for the first time to finish off my kara attunment really early in TBC epic instance, epic feeling to get it done after numerous attempts, i also remember first time i went into VH at like mig 70's with some guildies feeling that same trepidation, expecting the door health to mean something, expecting insurmountable waves expecting in short to have my ass handed to me needless to say 30 mins later i think was the lowest point of my WOW &quot;career&quot; that was when i was like wow they really are dumbing this down for the kids and questioned whether i would still be playing at christmas luckily OS3D kept me busy<br />

I point this out because GC is constantly saying that; healers (in Cata) need to be constantly aware of their mana and a healer just can't &quot;spam&quot; heal. Ummm.. all I saw this paladin doing is using Flash heal, the occasional holy Light and holy shock. Ummmm.... Hmmmm... does GC perhaps mean: In Cata raiding, healers will have to be more aware of their mana? And perhaps only during a raiding environment that healers won't be spamming the same 2 or 3 things every encounter? Hmmm... if this is how all the new instancees, and even raids are going to be.

That could probably be explained by the simple fact that this is a normal leveling dungeon with the current t10 gear, while GC is obviously talking about raiding, which is a whole another story when it comes to healing.<br />

You're basically talking out of your ass and you're one of those morons who get nerdragey over what spells the camera-man is using rather than what he's letting you see. And one wonders why people view WoW players as socially inept sperglords, I really can't imagine. You can ask my guilds how I play when I'm not on an unfamiliar pre-made with no addons and my hotkeys are all screwed up, w/e, that obsession of yours sounds really unhealthy. I'm sure when you provide videos of your 'pro play', we can all happily critique them. Until then, you're being a whiny bitch and nobody is impressed. I'd like to say I'm surprised that people can be this retarded, but I'm not, because it's WoW and you'll always find a new low with plenty of people residing in it.</div></div><hr />

My machine is fine, I can encode in almost real-time, it's my ISP that holds me back.</div></div><hr />

I was so thankful that shit was removed and they had to go and place it back. Don't get me wrong I find the new level of difficulty placed into these instances is a good thing(Even though Black Rock is as easy as it appears), but I hated kiting. I made a DPS class to DPS to do just that, DPS; not spend most a fight dancing around in a circle and keep a special mob away while everyone else gets the better part of the job. Hopefully *that* will be removed or start adding instance where kiting is needed by someone *other* than the hunters. I'd love to see something like a warlock getting forced to kite.<br />
<br />
CC to include kiting is back, not kiting alone. The best DPS are the ones that can get their CC in place and keep massive dps on the remaining mobs with breaking any of the CC'd mobs. Bring on the saps, fears, freezing traps, shackles, roots, polys, etc. You havent really played until you've ground out the 7+ mob pulls in Heroic Shattered Halls in a group wearing L70 blues. Kiting fights like the old Drak in vanilla UBRS weren't all that common.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a reason it was taken out of 5mans. It was hard to do correctly unless you always had the right players.<br />
<br />
People can't even do Heroic HOR, and that's a simple heal/tank with some group positioning and kill order. I don't want to have to suffer through randoms with people who can't grasp CC'ing and kiting of all things.<br />
<br />
Leave that to the raids, where complexity is expected.<br />

<br />
For Razorgore in BWL, our warlocks double and sometimes triple kited the dragonkin spawns with fear pingponging. It was good fun and all, but I wouldn't ask people to do this in 5 mans or anything.</div></div><hr />

Ahh the old 'people have trouble with existing content so it's ok for it to be easy and dumbed down'. How about we don't cater to the lowest common denominator and then act all surprised when doing so lowers the overall skill level of the community? A group without CC? What kind of group would that be exactly? There's plenty of CC to go around, nobody is expecting you to have to CC 3 different targets, but 1 would be nice, the expectation of kiting would be nice (there are plenty of classes able to do that, hunter is ideal, but others can pull it off). I truly despise this attitude that because some idiot pubbies can't do something, everyone should be forced to endure easy instances. <br />
<br />
Also get a guild, random groups shouldn't be something you ever aspire to be a part of.<br />

No-one is asking for Razorgore level kiting, but having some in the first place would be nice.</div></div><hr />

I really enjoy the commentary A LOT, I enjoy the video content. There is nothing more you can do (maybe speed up some bits just a little faster).<br />
<br />
As for those idiots trolling, and trying to flame you.<br />
Fuck them, you deserve a medal for you videos. Anyone who is too blind to realise the artwork you have done (videos), is a dumbass, and should be shot, with a potato. (Yes you can do that).<br />
<br />
Kudos to you, here's a cookie, and here's +1 internets.</div></div><hr />
