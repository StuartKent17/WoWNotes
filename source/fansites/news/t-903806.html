We've seen a lot of discussion and debate over the new set bonuses. Just so everyone is aware, we're still assessing the set bonuses for tier 12 as we go through more testing and gathering more feedback.<br />
<br />
To give you a heads up on what we're looking at so far though, here are the most recent bonuses we have in mind for some of the sets (some of what's listed below are amendments to the existing bonuses on the PTR).<br />
<br />
Some of these bonuses might already be live as of the build pushed earlier this week, while some are yet to be implemented. If your class/specialization isn't listed here, it means the bonuses either haven't changed, or the changes haven't been solidified. Just the same, all of this is subject to ch-ch-changes over the course of the PTR process. Your feedback is appreciated!<br />

Don't Worry Folks. We Got This.<br />
We've been repeatedly saying in various threads recently that we are listening, even if we're not acting on every piece of feedback we read. Well readers, listen up!<br />
<br />
With the help of Ghostcrawler, the following will be added to the patch notes for the next PTR update:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Players are once again free to dance in combat (without causing graphic errors). Other animations, such as attacks, will take precedence over dancing. The dance animation will be suppressed until the higher priority animation is complete. Fun has been unnerfed.<br />
<br />
<br />
The concerns of the people vanished. And there was much dancing. <br />

Patch 4.2 Conquest Points Changes<br />
So, as many of you are interpreting this change, it is to encourage more participation in Rated Battlegrounds. We see the fact that participating in Arenas is by far the superior way of obtaining top-notch PvP gear, in terms of time investment, as a problem. If you want to maximize your Conquest Point gains in patch 4.2, you'll need to participate at least a little bit in Rated Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
We know this may not sound very appealing to those of you who have grown accustomed to spending as little as an hour a week getting the top PvP currency in the game via Arenas over the last couple of expansions. To put things in perspective though, the total number of items that can be purchased with Conquest Points today is much larger than what you used to be able to buy with Arena Points pre-Deathwing world explosion. And there is no longer a requirement to “grind” unrated BGs for Honor each season, so the real time investment isn't changing as much as some players are perceiving it to be.<br />
<br />
On top of that, the frank reality is that the total time investment required in season 9 to get all your points has been much, much too low, as you could do that from a few 2v2 Arena games each week completed in less than an hour’s time. It shows that Rated Battlegrounds are currently sub-par in terms of the rate at which points can be accumulated.<br />
<br />
We do feel this change is necessary to keep the time investment vs. high-quality item accumulation in check, even if it doesn't read well on paper. However, as always, your constructive feedback is welcomed. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/175267/42-conquest-change))<br />

Holy Paladins Nerf in 4.2<br />
We increased paladin mana costs because they were too efficient at healing. In raid encounters, for instance, paladins were sitting at 40% of their mana while the other healers were flat out of mana. Paladins were casting Divine Light as their main heal because they didn’t need the efficiency of Holy Light. You personally may not have been in that situation, but when looking at the overall picture, as well as running plenty of tests, this was our conclusion overall. It is entirely possible this will hurt Holy paladins in PvP, where mana can be harder to come by. It is our hope that the recent Speed of Light change as well as another change or two coming will help offset that.<br />
<br />
We did not make these mana cost changes because of the change to critical heals or because of any upcoming set bonuses (which are still being designed, by the way). We made the changes only because paladins were too efficient compared to druids, priests and shaman.<br />
<br />
As a postscript, we see a lot of paladins advocating a strategy of Beacon the tank, heal the off-tank with Divine Light, and never ever do anything else... and if you ever heal the Beacon target, you fail. That’s just not a realistic goal. Stuff is going to happen that is unpredictable, or else you’d probably win every fight. You should make the most of Beacon, absolutely. It’s a great tool. But you shouldn’t consider anything that doesn’t maximize Beacon to be a class design or personal performance failure. Sometimes you’re going to want to heal the Beacon target directly. It happens.(Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/175265/holy-paladin-healing-on-42-after-nerfs))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archimand</div><div class="date">2011-05-13, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the tank changes is simply cus when you use small tanking cooldown as the 20% damage reduction and you add more % to dodge or parry to it that make the tanking cd pointless as there is no reason you will want to take less damage if you gonna dodge/parry it anyway<br />
<br />
with the new design you will take less damage for 10sec and after that you avoid more which will make those small cd alot more powerful</div></div><hr />

But if it occurs after the shield wall, it should be more than 6 % or it could just be after shield block, which would be nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason is why pop a damage reduction cool down, if you chance not to be hit has just doubled. It's a semi-waste of a cool down.<br />
<br />
This way you get more benefit overall.<br />
<br />
I like all the redesigns thus far, and props to Disc/Holy 4-Set change, much better.<br />

Posted by Zarhym, and indicates &quot;with the help of Ghostcrawler&quot;. And I'm sure they plunked an intern down to use 5 minutes of his lunch break to remedy the problem that caused them to remove the ability to dance in combat to begin with - the torsion and tearing of some player models. Takes a little bit more than copy-delete-delete-delete-paste-at-line-457.<br />
<br />
Yet they haven't gotten the same dumb intern to edit the code to fix the female orc channeling animation they broke in the Wrath beta.<br />

<br />
I have a feeling that 40% chance to get 6% of base mana every 6 seconds will proc all the time from holy shock and the spell crit from the talents and stacking Int stats. thus it will overpower the nerf changes on higher mana costs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So...how long does it last? Because right now DRW is 20% extra parry for 12s. Where is the 15% extra? Is it 20% for 12s then 15% for Xs after? Because I SERIOUSLY hope they aren't talking about making is 0% parry for 12s and then 35% parry for Xs after. Because that would be the most retarded tanking cooldown ever (&quot;gee I hope I live long enough for my damage reduction to kick in!&quot;)<br />
<br />
I make it actually make DRW useful by glyphing it so it turns into a threat cooldown. With the glyph, my threat generation increases 50% while it's active. I love this, because now when I already used D&amp;D for the pull and then &quot;OH SHIT NEW ADS&quot; I can pop DRW and spam blood boil and it pretty well locks them to me. Given the 60 runic cost, there's no temptation to use it ever pull because you often can't. I think the glyphed version should be frankly baseline given that it's our ultimate ability.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see, actually, is for the 4-set to clone Death Strikes. Because as far as I can tell, when I Death Strike with DRW active, my clone weapon isn't contributing any shield or health back. I would love to see that change, and now when I DS with DRW up I get an extra 50% health and shield. THAT would be a bonus.</div></div><hr />

Because Blizzard has decided nobody is allowed to have unapproved fun with THEIR game.

<br />
A few points with your post:<br />
1. Bliz has already stated that they want Shadow Bolt to be the filler for Aff, not Drain Life. DL would make Aff too close to SPriest playstyle. That DL is better now is merely coincidence, not design. Don't expect it to last through patches.<br />
2. Destro doesn't spam more Incinerates then Aff spams Shadow Bolts. It's actually reversed due to Nightfall/Corr Glyph procs and destro's need to hardcast Soul Fire (ie. 25m Nef (http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/phcgo0vrmzxjoqi4/sum/damageDone/?s=6343&amp;e=6823) Kilmir = destro = 61 Incin, Hathor = aff = 71 SBolt)<br />
3. Demon is the spec which will benefit the most due to spending much more casttime on SBolts and hasted Incins. But nobody complains because it's also the spec that could use a boost the most.<br />
4. These tier bonuses were a first draft on the PTR, mostly showing the idea in rudimentary form. Finishers and such are an easy oversight and usually fixed before they go live. This has been always the case with PTR so don't go nuts over nothing. Just bugreport it.</div></div><hr />

I haven't played my lock since Cata because I pretty much feel like a shadow priest now.<br />
<br />
The list of things that could peacefully coexist in the game but don't because the developers are egotistical shits who HAVE to get their way is longer than my arm. Play their game, or quit. That's the message. Sorry man. :\<br />
<br />
At least their way or the highway approach is starting to seriously hurt their subs now. A few more months with that trend will surely lead to a much needed shake up in the dev department there and maybe they will hire people who don’t regard game development as their personal sandbox and who know the term “customer relationship.</div></div><hr />

I am glad they told me I am sitting on 40% of my mana while other healers had run out, I must of missed that, but if Blizz tells me this it must be true. And they don't like Paladins using Divine Light, but Holy Light instead? Is this some form of a joke? Are they TELLING us what spells we should be casting now? Yeah you have 5 heals but we really don't want you using that one too much. Oh and god forbid we use Becon of Light on the main tank .... <br />
<br />
So at the start of Cataclysm they also told Ret pallys they would be a true hybrid healer, and throw a Word of Glory to a tank getting low. They even gave us a talent (Selfless healer) to encourage the use of healing from a ret pally. But then they slap Word of Glory with a 20 second cooldown. Its just another example of what Blizz wants us to do, and how we should play, rather than adapting our own play style and do something different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BLizzard is full of it. They force their ways upon the spec once more - TOTALLY ignoring how much effect this might have in PVP - where you often use ANOTHER judgemnt and can not stand in melle range. <br />
<br />
I remembers Sunwell. The total and utter humiliation that holy spec went through. Many paladins left the game during those months and I got the feeling exactly the same is happening now. Cause BLizzard is once more deleberatly singleling out holy palas to take the full blow.<br />
<br />
How is the healing vs mana ratio for the healing classes over 50 GCDs? Take a look and see how totally out of touch BLIzzard is with its game atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What Blizzard does not understand is that Holy light is CRAP. And they also dont realise that ALL holy paladins judge back mana with the GC that they otherwise would be casting a mana conserv spell like Holy lihgt. And then they holy shock or divine light instead after the judgment. <br />
<br />
Its not our fault that Paladins are not as naive as Blizzard and have found a better way than the themepark devs say things should be done. BUt what do the themepark devs do ? They force themselfs upont the spec with their way as the only way. <br />
<br />
My suggestion to all Holy paladins right now is to chancel sub and walk away. This has gone on way to far. Blizzard is staring at one number (mana) and not looking at the overall healing stats. Holy paladins are THE WEAKEST OVERALL healer and their spell armory has been hit by a 16% flat extra tax based to other classes healing vs mana ratio. And once again that number is IGNORING that to maintain this high amount of mana they need to spend a GCD every 8 sec that has NOTHING to do with healing.</div></div><hr />

Amen. How about developers stop going out of their way to ruin dual-wield unholy or tanking. Even when it actually works by complete accident and no thanks to the developers...they will actually spend resources to stamp it out. It's one thing to say, hey we don't really believe in this so we aren't going out of our way to make it work.

Prot used to be fun, but like everything else, Blizz changed to to be less fun. &quot;Lets give all paladins a small heal they can use instead of gaining threat&quot;. By 4.1 they changed their minds already.<br />
<br />
Just like in 4.1<br />
Hunter - multi shot buff<br />
Frost DK - howling blast buff<br />
<br />
4.2<br />
hunter - multi shot nerf<br />
frost dk - obliterate nerf<br />
<br />
In a way, its like they always have to be seen to be doing SOMETHING.</div></div><hr />

Ret was dreadful after Cataclysm because of the new RP system. I have to be honest, I could't get used to the mechanics, so went prot/holy very quickly. Having too many resources and not enough runic power never helped.<br />
<br />
Inquisition - Bit like our version of Slice and Dice or Savage Roar. 30% damage buff<br />
Selfless healer - Another 12% physical damage buff<br />
Zelotry - another buff<br />
Templar's Verdict - our MAIN NUKE .... however if you try and keep the above buffs/cooldown up, you never get to use it.<br />
<br />
God forbid you actually use Zelotry in pve, while trying to keep your buffs up and try find time to use Templar's verdict. You now have to weave in Hammer of wrath too. Oh and you have an Exorcism proc too. The Dev who came up with the system was one of the devs in question that it has to be &quot;his way of the highway&quot; because nobody i have ever spoken to likes the changes to ret either. They also hated the WoG changes to prot and now the final blow to some is the holy changes too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Holy:<br />
2-Piece - Casting Flash of Light, Holy Light, or Divine Light on your Beacon of Light target has a 40% chance to grant you 2% of your base mana.<br />
<br />
4-Piece - Your Divine Light also heals a nearby injured target for 20% of the amount healed.<br />
<br />
The old 2pc FORCED you to heal your beacon for a 40% chance at a mere 2% of your base mana. Not only were you losing out on 50% extra healing for healing the beacon, but your mana returns were utter garbage. Now the new 2pc takes away the 'heal the beacon' requirement and you should get equal or more mana if you use Holy Shock on CD, which most Holy Paladins do.<br />
<br />
The old 4pc and new 4pc are probably about even, but the fact that all your direct heals heal another nearby target instead of just Divine Light is rather nice since you can now spam HL and basically heal as if you had 2 beacons (or 1 beacon with extra heals if that person happens to be close by and hurt) rather than being forced to spam DL and go oom in a matter of seconds.<br />
<br />
Also, as for the mana increases, it really shouldn't hurt that bad in the long run. I mean, the mana increases were in the single digits of percents for all the spells. 8% to 9%? Wow, that's HUGE, isn't it? If you weren't having trouble with your mana before, you most likely won't in 4.2. And the nerfs to other class's mana regen abilities? It'll be offset by the increased amount of mana regen from gear.</div></div><hr />

It wont really give the valid heal it needs, as you use the SW for aoe healing not for the big extra heal on 1 random target.<br />
I dont see the point in giving the 4 set to SW I wont be worth going for it as a prio.<br />
I feelt that the 4 set from before was better all thou seams strange considering, <br />
2 set gives mana back and dropping it of would make us lose the chance of getting mana back.<br />

Item - Druid T12 Restoration 4P Bonus - Your Swiftmend also heals an injured target within 8 yards for the same amount.<br />
<br />
Why would you put a big heal on a aoe proced spell, is bloody stupid.<br />
having a big healing proc on a aoe procing spell is just waste of the aoe proc of SW and the new design scene cata would be riped apart and be of no good at all. With the new t12 bonus you would want to use it for those whom will take big hits (aka tank(s)) and using a aoeheal on 1 tank is as we all know shite and waste of good aoe healing. I dont get how you can think putting a big heal on SW would be better then having LB drop and heal two players close to the effected target. At lest that was something you could work with. please for the love of.. think a bit harder on the 4 set bonus.</div></div><hr />
