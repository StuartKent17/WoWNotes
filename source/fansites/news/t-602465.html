Bug Fixes<br />
Clients utilizing OpenGL video modes will no longer experience graphical anomalies and missing textures after minimizing/maximizing the window.<br />
Fixed an issue that caused Fel Eye Stalks during the Legion Ring event to not despawn when the event is completed.<br />
Fixed an issue where zoning after mounting and summoning a pet was disconnecting players.<br />
Fixed an issue where the Shift key would get stuck in game.<br />
Using a /equip macro while affected by certain crowd control spells will no longer cause the items in the macro to be stuck in your inventory.<br />
Using very low values for SetScale() will no longer cause Mac users to disconnect from the game.<br />
Default sound channels have been changed from 12 to 32.<br />
Microphone resources will no longer be claimed by World of Warcraft when Voice Chat is disabled.<br />
Sounds will no longer stutter and pause if large amounts of creatures are being hit with AoE attacks from multiple sources.<br />
Sounds caused by spells cast on or by the player will now play more consistently.</div></div><hr />

Long answer: It's great that you had a nice weapon when you were level 60, but no one is entitled to free awesome gear until the last WoW server shuts down. That means that even your legendary is going to be replaced by something better, eventually. <br />
<br />
/clap<br />
<br />
While people aren't suggesting it would be free loot, we keep moving forward with World of Warcraft, at some point there is meant to be a better item to replace what you have. Sending a new warrior to Molten Core at level 80 so he can start upgrading a Legendary item isn't the direction we want to go.<br />

Some one link me proof the this includes enchants, gems and set bonuses<br />
<br />
It includes enchants, gems, and all other items. The only exceptions are temporary buffs, and some BC leveling greens with &quot;of the...&quot; stats, and some Zul'Gurub items, as there is a current limitation on how many different stats can be distributed on an item, which we're working to extend for the future.<br />

When patch 2.3 is available on the Public Test Realms, hopefully the Cenarion Expedition will let you take a look before purchasing.<br />

Hehe, I think it will take more than a patch to make this problem go away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it could be hotfixed, it would have been already.<br />
<br />
And better to fix some of these now, such as the disconnection issue, than to wait for the month or so of testing that 2.3 will require.</div></div><hr />

The threshold below which we will skip a PTR phase is now very low.<br />
<br />
The mantra is basically &quot;every patch gets a PTR cycle&quot; for any significant code or data change. 2.2.3 exceeds that threshold by quite a bit. &quot;<br />

I'd rather wait 2 days for a patch then 12 hours to play at all lol</div></div><hr />

Major changes/bugfixes to the sound engine. Even if a lot of players don't care, they still need to test them. ^^</div></div><hr />
