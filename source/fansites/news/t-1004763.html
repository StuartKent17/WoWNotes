Why does Ghostcrawler hate paladins?<br />
A ret paladin killed his parents.<br />
<br />
Shadow Priests: The wording on the new Shadow Orbs suggests that they're going to be based on a resource, is that true?<br />
We're still working on the details but yeah, it will be a secondary resource kind of mechanic, take out the RNG aspect maybe. The idea currently is that Mind Blast will cost shadow orbs and have no cooldown<br />
<br />
Are you satisfied by healing in PvP?<br />
Balancing PvE and PvP healing is kind of a big challenge. Its something we talk about all the time, I dont think we have solved the problem yet and its something we are still working on. We've seen a lot of dual caster comps in the blizzcon tournament and we've buffed Mortal Strike and healing reduction in 4.3 and hopefully you'll be able to bring back warriors and rogues in PvP. <br />
<br />
How do the old debuff talents work with new talent tree and tanking model?<br />
We want tanks to do more of the active things to keep themselves alive rather than relying on the healers<br />
<br />
My classes are about classes that have a 100 cap on a resource. Currently there are talents that increase these resource, are there any plans for the new talent trees to do that?<br />
It's going to vary on class by class basis, its something that does not really fit into the current talent system as it is currently designed.<br />
<br />
I have 10 characters, will you add an 11th slot so we can have all 11 classes?<br />
Not sure just yet, might keep the current character cap but let you have them on any realm, so you can have many many charaters on one realm<br />
<br />
For event items like the Scourge Invasion or the Vengeful PvP set, can we get those for transmog account-wide?<br />
We want to make sure that all the times you remember from the good old days are available for transmog. Im happy you brought up the vengeful set, and in Area 52 there are vendors where can you buy these items. Regarding accountwide event items we have to watch out on our side as its kind of resource expensive. We could certainly look into that.<br />
<br />
Can feral druids have two fist weapons? / As an enchanter we never got any good drops, are we getting new enchanting item drops?<br />
Nope, working the talents to support it would make a mess. Monk tanks will use staff or polearm. / No plans on enchanting item drops to change.<br />
<br />
I was wondering since this next expansion coming out is going to be so faction focused, if we could see faction specific legendaries for maybe a shield like Might of the Alliance or for the horde a Fist of the horde that are completely badass <br />
Legendaries are something we look at on case to case bases, if the stories supports it and we find a cool item possibility. Everything is always possible. (GC loves the idea)<br />
<br />
Death Knight tanks are bad right now, stats and talents need some changes. Set bonus is based on us being at low health, which shouldn't happen. What changes will fix these problems?<br />
Death Knights get some love in 4.3 to fix survivability, Blood presence armor bonus is going to 55% from 30%. We don't want Death Knights to get killed in one GCD, but we don't want them to be the best tank by far<br />
<br />
A balance druid can be really low on the damage and then theres the problem of sitting on solar when we need to do AoE, is there anything you guys are planning on doing to adress that like the DK ability that generates unholy power<br />
In 5.0 Hurricane will have a new arcane function to make sure you can use it whenever you have to. <br />
<br />
Any plans to improve the Death Knight gargoyle melee attack?<br />
Nope, it is designed to work at range, There are no plans to change Death Knight stat weights during this expansion, maybe some balancing in MoP.<br />
<br />
I have been playing since vanilla and one of my fav items i have been using up to today is noggaholic elixier, and i am wondering why we cant mount while skeleton<br />
Our animation system does not have animations for some costume models that can be on a mount so we decided to completely disallow mounting while transformed to make it consistent, it was the only way to fix hundred of bugs. <br />
<br />
Is there any plan to make solo Holy Priest DPS better? Running daily quests take a lot of time in Holy. <br />
Nope, we have dual spec, it isn't a priority for us to make it viable for raiding or fast daily quests. We have to keep it balanced for PvP as well. In the Firelands some of the daily quests are designed to be actually easier for healers. <br />
<br />
I'm a rogue so thanks for the legendary! Regarding the new introduction of the Windwalker monk class and also the formalization of cat druids as an official spec, with all these new melee DPS hybrids what doyou guys have planned as rogues to be competitive as a utilitiy class?<br />
Everyone brings a little bit of everything, reasons to get a rogue now are things like poisons, interrupts and stuns. These will stay important during encounters. <br />
<br />
New talents will still be cookie cutter, how is this new?<br />
Most give utility choices rather than damage, this can't be number crunched. We will continue to balance them to make them hard choices.<br />
<br />
Quick followup to the noggenfogger elixir question, there have been other places where you get onto something when you lose a transformation and then get it back later <br />
One of the things that make consumables fun is that they are consumables. They can go away. If they were permanent things you are going to lose the impact of what a transformation really is. Fundamentally we want these to be fun things that arent everywhere. Ideally we would have it make an error message if you are near to doing this.<br />
<br />
Archeology has been ignored as far as i can tell other than a few things here and there, are we gonna see lower than max level items on max variety?<br />
The archeology items are all over the place, I use the vrykul helm always because I like being bigger than everyone else. We are looking into ways to sex it up and take out the grindy nature of it.<br />
<br />
Tanking as a druid, I can go cat and do decent DPS when I am not getting hit. Is the new druid 4-specs model going to let me do that?<br />
Other tanks can't do that and you won't be able to do that anymore, talents are set up this way to keep both seperate for PvP and PvE.<br />
<br />
Resto druids have pretty decent single target rotation for healing, but when we want to AoE heal we go back to mindlessly spamming buttons. Are we getting more options for this in the next expansion?<br />
There is one new ability plan like the wild mushroom to detonate to heal people. A lot of druids enjoy that kind of playstyle. When we did try to tone down the HoTs we got a lot of push back there. Some of the healing you mentioned is also needed in an encounter and we will try to not do this as much.<br />
<br />
The 4pc bear T13 bonus, you don't want cats to get it but it's also impacting utility for bears?<br />
You can swap to bear, press it, go back. We can't let cats use it because it would just force them to add it their rotation and stack them in raid, we'd just have to change the bonus completely.<br />
<br />
Are we getting new spells at like 86, 88 and 90? If so, what are the new mage spells?<br />
We are adding a lot of new spells to fill out the talent trees. One plan we have talked about is to get one new spell at level 87. Pretty sure we are not going to be able to get 3 more spells along the way. We dont know yet what the mage one will be. In the past we said 5-8 new abilties while they level up. Some classes however might get more than one new ability. <br />
<br />
Can we have another tank legendary<br />
Legendary needs a story to go with it, we aren't taking turns with the classes or specs, we put them in where they fit in the story. If there is an opportunity you will get one! A legendary shield would be great.<br />
<br />
Regarding arcane mage mastery, it created the possibility for really deep gameplay for managing your resource. But we were promised this toolkit to manage our mana and all we got was Arcane Blast and clearing our Arcane Blast stacks. Are we gonna get anything else to help us not be 2 button wonders and make it deeper?<br />
We are really not happy with the role of Arcane Barrage, we have some plans to make arcane more deeper. We would like to redesign so that Arcane Missiles barrage and explosion all have an equal role in the arcane role.<br />
<br />
Can we have some shadowform tweaks so that you can see the gear?<br />
We have a glyph in 4.3 coming to tweak the alpha of shadowform<br />
<br />
Where is the Death Knight tier 13?<br />
Its really awesome and you will see it soon<br />
<br />
What about new Death Knight gear for transmog? Other classes can go back farther.<br />
That is really expensive art to do. For us its a metter of budget, if we ask for certain armor sets we have to delay patches or expansions to get them. We have to make hard choices sometimes and it's not a matter of just throwing money at the problem, it just takes more time and delays things further.<br />
<br />
Can we have strength polearms?<br />
They are awkward right now, we want all Strength classes to be able to use them. Maybe in MoP with the hunter tweaks it will be possible.<br />
<br />
Back in vanilla you had the hunter epic questline with Rok'delar and I was wondering if you guys are going to bring that back at all<br />
It's something we are looking at and are considering, if we do something like that it has to be on our level of quality. It's also worth noting that that feel of solo quest/gameplay is something we've tried to re-introduce in 4.2 and 4.3 with the new legendary staff and legendary dagger.<br />
<br />
Engineers got cool stuff in the past, can we have more powerful versions or something new and cool?<br />
Yes, we can make powerful and cool stuff but it has to have downsides. We can add some new stuff with restrictions on where you can actually use it, not PvP, so that it is still balanced.<br />
<br />
Regarding hunters; you are eliminating the use for melee weapons, are we still going to be able to equip it? Can we also get some mace love?<br />
There are not any plans for that now, we are probably not going to let you equip melee. If it makes you feel better, the rogues wont be able to equip the orange legendary bow either. We do want to change hunters so you can see quivers and or ammo pouches, potentially customize them, etc. <br />
<br />
What happened to engineering, you make it very cool once and then added something useless every once in a while. Goggles were very cool, but there are no upgrades, so they are worthless now. Archaeology gives almost as many pets as engineering.<br />
We made engineering too good, then it was not so good. We are trying to make sure it offers cool stuff this time. Post your suggestions on the forums!<br />
<br />
How is monk healing going to work? When I played yesterday you had chi and light and dark power. Is it going to be like I choose healing spec and you get a mana bar or something? <br />
When you switch to healing stance you will get a mana bar, and regarding healing, the monk will be less target based and more proximity based. And there is also this mechanics where you can put statues in the raid, and when you melee the boss they give out healing for example. We are challenging ourselves into new ways to look at this.<br />
<br />
One of the things WoW doesn't have right now is a melee cloth class. When you announced the monk yesterday I was super excited and I was wondering if there was any discussion to make them a cloth class to make them have a better monk feel? <br />
The main concern was that if we introduce a melee cloth healer, we'd need a whole new kind of item drops in the loot table and you'd have to wait for your specific gear to drop. That's why we went for an already existing loot archetype, you already have the leather agi and leather int/spirit and it was the best way to go without having to create new armor types. <br />
<br />
Since we're going to be able to name companion pet, is there any chance we'll be able to name warlock pets? <br />
You're just grabbing a demon for your own use from the Twisting Nether, use it, and then get rid of it, it's not the same emotional attachment as a companion pet or hunter pet. Something we did talk about is a way to reset the name of your pets, for when you get a pet and really don't like the name.<br />
<br />
I know that removing the min range for hunters is a great key, but for melee this means we are losing some stats too<br />
Everyone is losing some stats with the ranged slots, relics, etc ... going away. Your range weapon will have stats so you wont lose more stats than everyone else. <br />
<br />
JCing and Inscription selling is hard because of constant undercutting from others or gold farmers. Can we have perfect cuts back so that we have something not mass produced to sell?<br />
That is how an open market works. Perfect gem cuts are problematic because nobody would use the regular blue ones. BoP Chaos Orbs help for some professions, maybe we should do something like that for Jewelcrafting.<br />
<br />
I got to play the monk, and the play of it feels amazing. Can we expect the removal of auto attack on other classes? If so, hunters will be really confused. <br />
The monk not having auto attack was controversial around the office too, we are not even 100% sure the monk will keep it. And removing auto attack for other classes will just feel like a huge change. We do crazy things on new stuff, not on old stuff. There are some downsides too - if a monkey has 5hp left they have to wait to push a button again were as a Rogue would just kill it with its auto attack.</div></div><hr />

Thats not quite what was implied. What was implied is that the current 50 character total cap we have, accross all servers (so max chars you can have, on all servers you play on, is 50) and just remove the current 10 char cap per server. That'd be a bit silly really. I think it would make sense to up it to 15, seens as some people like to play their main as a twink, or just like to have 2 druids, boomkin/resto and then another with feral spec etc etc.</div></div><hr />

It shouldn't. That's the whole point. The nw model is that there should be no reason not to bring a class. Other than that you shouldn't be forced to have a certain class in your raid. In this sense any melee should be able to fill the melee spot including the said rogue.</div></div><hr />

So far that was the only real question asked. The rest of this stuff could have been asked 3 years go. I don´t think they would have answered it like that unless that is currently the plan.

<br />
Don´t get excited, it just means that since they nerfed our need to generate threat, instead of pushing ´mangle´ and doing damage, all tanks will be pushing shield wall etc. Just replace most of our damage dealing abilities with short CD defense buttons.. and that is what they mean. It is doubtful they will want healers to dps more, because all that will end up happening is raids will bring less healers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4 specs use leather agi (combat, assassination, subtlety, feral) and 2 use int leather (Balance and Resto).<br />
4 specs use mail agi (BM, MM, surv, enhancement) and 2 use int mail (ele and Resto).<br />
<br />
Arguably in MoP 5 will use leather agi, but there's really not much difference, and since monks are famous for generally being lightly armored melee types leather makes the most sense, plus they can share some stuff between bears and brewmaster.</div></div><hr />

Balancing PvE and PvP healing is kind of a big challenge. Its something we talk about all the time, I dont think we have solved the problem yet and its something we are still working on. We've seen a lot of dual caster comps in the blizzcon tournament and we've buffed Mortal Strike and healing reduction in 4.3 and hopefully you'll be able to bring back warriors and rogues in PvP.<br />
<br />
If you want to help the situation or better yet fix it.. Since Resilience lowers the amount of player damage taken, make it also lower the amount of player healing taken as well. I mean you could do the decreased healing a lower percent than damage that way it evens out the two or make it more balanced. Now you don't have to worry about PVE healing seeing it won't be affected also because people won't be tanking in all PVP gear anymore in PVE. IMO</div></div><hr />

This question wouldn't be very good either. Two mail classes use agi, two leather classes use agi. One mail class uses int, one leather class uses int.

Stuns are as good as any other CC. The poisons bring the same utility as any other spell, but in poison form rather than magic / curse. Interrupts are the same as any other class.<br />
This doesn't make you pick a rogue over any other class, it makes you pick whoever is the best player, because their utility is on par.</div></div><hr />

That having been said, I don't know why Blizz sticks to this &quot;warlocks can't name their pets because they are so detached&quot; line, its silly. It doesn't make sense that to impose this RP idea about what you as a warlock think about your demons rather than letting the player decide. The argument against warlocks not being able to name their pets that DOES make sense is this: All of the demons you summon already have names, just like people. With the possible exception of the felhunter and maybe the infernal, all of the demons you enslave are sentient and come from a culture of demons so naturally they would have their own name already, and you can't change the name that other demon's already call each other by. Hunter pets are like RL animals and therefore it makes sense to name them.</div></div><hr />

So much posting from people who think GW2 has anything original. So much posting from people who think Rift has anything original. We get it, we know these are the first MMORPGs you ever played.. but that doesn´t mean everything they have is new to the genre. Before you post about being creative, at least do a little work and look at older games that had pretty much the ídeas´of everything we are seeing now. UO champion spawns = Warhammer PQs = Rifts. All based around the same concept. About 10 games, including the pen and paper D&amp;D have monk classes. Street Fighter had no autoattack and was even mentioned by the devs.. why would you think they stole it from GW when it has been in games for about 30 years now.<br />

Your wow &quot;fanboyism&quot; and love of panda has turned you into a troll. People aren't just saying it to piss other people off they're saying because it's true. They've taken a ton of stuff from Gw2. Ideas that don't even fit into the frame work of wow. <br />

This new expansion looks bad and is going to be bad. The questions asked at this Q&amp;A are pure garbage. Things they've answered multiple times already. Year after year.

They dont have all that much time because they do NOT spend anytime actually balancing classes, all they do is 20%, 33% 66% or 100% buff's/nerfs they don't do 5% here 10% there, 27%on this, 2% on that, and then 6% here. They do not ever do small nerfs/buffs. they either over buff, or over nerf. They never spend time actually trying to get it &quot;just right&quot;. If they actually spent time testing the game internally, spent time testing the changes they want to implement vs just puttin it on PTR, only to completely disregard the mass majority of the data and then go plopping it on live servers to &quot;see how it'll go&quot;... they would have balance in the game. Then they wouldnt spend the mass majority of their time... balancing the classes. So the excuse of &quot;we dont have time&quot;.. is total BS. They have no time because they have a whole barrel full of problems and all they ever do is put a bandaid on it instead of stitching it up. If they did actually test it, and put forethought into the changes.. then the mass majority of all the patch notes.. wouldnt be class changes.<br />
<br />
I dont like what it said about resto druids having a shroom based heal. having to cast three shrooms.. before detonating them for a big AoE heal? and then what they said about moonkin AoE and hurricane? unless they lower the mana cost while upping the damage it will still be ditched in favor of shrooms consider how cheap shrooms are and how much damage they do.<br />
<br />
and whats the BS about sharing items across accounts, eg. get item on account 1 and accounts 2-10 can use it for transmogging, taking more resources?.... i mean its basically 1 item vs 10.. are they seriously saying getting/storing an item 10 times(once per character) costs less space then storing it once and just sending up a flag account wide saying &quot;hey you have this item on x toon you can transmog!&quot; thus allowing any toon on said account/server to use said item for transmogging purposes?..... what takes less space and resources.. 1 or 10? i want what ever they're smokin</div></div><hr />

I don't think the point anyone is trying to make when they say &quot;They took ___ feature from Rift/TOR/GW2&quot; is meant to be taken as &quot;rift/TOR/Gw2 did that idea first it belongs to them&quot; but more along the lines of &quot;all blizzard has announced is that they are taking all the announced features from Rift, TOR and GW2 and adding it in one expansion&quot; the point people are making is that.. nothing announced in the last two days.. is anything not already announced by Wows three main competitors.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. It indicates we will be able to make up to 50 characters on one realms, instead of 10 characters per realm up to a total of 50. <br />
<br />
<br />
Basically they are THINKING about removing the 'realm cap' but keeping the 'total cap' in. Not allowing you to play your Alexstrasza Death Knight on Emerald Dream or something like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was not the question or answer given at all. There was first a highlight of the issue that Death Knight minions currently gain no benefit from Crit (which is a long standing bug) or Mastery and if there were plans to change that, and secondly can the Gargoyle be fixed so that instead of the DK having to spin around on the spot to force the Gargoyle to use it's ranged attack over it's crappy melee, they can just make the Ranged attack automatic preference.<br />
<br />
Their answer was the Gargoyle issue is something they can and will fix, and that they didn't want to readjust the minion issue mid expansion because it would excessivly screw with stat weights (even though they screw with Frost's stat weights commonly)</div></div><hr />

You're just grabbing a demon for your own use from the Twisting Nether, use it, and then get rid of it, it's not the same emotional attachment as a companion pet or hunter pet. Something we did talk about is a way to reset the name of your pets, for when you get a pet and really don't like the name.<br />
As someone whos played a lock for 6+ years their concept of how it works doesnt ring true to me. <br />
There is an emotional attachment because the demon ALWAYS has the same name - if every time you summoned one it was different then I would understand their POV - but they are wrong.<br />
Secondly as this demon is my minion or slave, I should be able to address it in whatever way i want.<br />
<br />
And finally due to game mechanics you do not lose demons when you log out or log back in - they are identical to hunters pets<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard are fundamentally wrong on this.</div></div><hr />

Green geared abominations who could DPS faster and harder than your epic'd up char, tank in every spec and do it better, and why not, they could selfheal for more than most people could too. No one else remembers the Unholy spec with the self rez and return to life as a Ghoul for one minute? You killed a DK, gg! NIGHTMARE MODE UNLOCKED. Getting right down to the nitty gritty of it, I do wonder if adding another class to the game was premature and even a bit ambitious.</div></div><hr />

They even said that they blocked all costumes so you can't mount. What a load of crap, i've got several costumes i am able to mount in. Blizzard stop being lazy and coming with BS explanations.

On top of that, is it so hard to make mounting available for Iron Dwarf costume as well? Not brain surgery to re-use the already ingame dwarf animation.</div></div><hr />
