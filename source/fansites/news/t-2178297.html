Addons &amp; Friendly Nameplates in Patch 7.2<br />
With Patch 7.2, we’re disabling the ability for addons to modify the appearance of friendly nameplates while inside dungeon and raid instances.<br />
<br />
While, for the most part, we’re impressed with -- and encourage -- the creativity that addon authors bring to the game using the addon API, occasionally an addon goes too far in terms of automating or trivializing elements of gameplay that are meant to be highly challenging. Recently, we’ve become aware of a couple addons that were using visual adjustments to friendly nameplates as a method to automatically coordinate complex positioning requirements. This caused what was intended to be a difficult test of a group’s ability to identify positioning requirements on the fly to instead become a simple matter of following a visual marker.<br />
<br />
In order to prevent this from continuing, we’ve had to disable the ability for addons to modify how friendly nameplates appear while inside of dungeon and raid instances. Nothing has changed outside of dungeons and raids – addons will still be able to customize the appearance of friendly nameplates everywhere else (most notably in PvP, where they’re most commonly used in ways we don’t consider problematic). <br />
<br />
We also don’t anticipate that addon authors will need to update their code to accommodate this change; customizations should simply stop working once a player zones into a raid, and start working again once they’ve left. However, if you’d like to double-check, this change should now be active in the current 7.2 PTR environment.<br />
<br />
Just to reiterate since I'm seeing some confusion:<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing whatsoever is changed while you are outside of a raid or dungeon When you zone into a raid or dungeon, only your friendly nameplates (if enabled) will be forced to use the standard Blizzard appearance Enemy nameplates can still be modified and customized by addons while in a raid or dungeon Once you zone out of the raid or dungeon, any changes made by an addon will once again apply<br />

New Death Grip Animation<br />
Thank you for creating a discussion around Death Grip; it has helped steer our final implementation for 7.2 immensely. Legion has seen many improvements to the feel and style of combat for WoW, and it is an initiative that we are continuing to pursue.<br />
<br />
The goal for all of these improvements is to maintain as much of the mechanical feel of abilities as possible (as they have existed for many years) while delivering an intuitive, consistent, and modern visual experience. For example, a hammer should deal damage when it slams into a murloc, not before. In some cases, we can bend the rules to allow clutch mechanical interactions to win, such as Death Strike providing its heal instantly while the damage occurs when your weapon connects.<br />
<br />
We will be following similar rules for our final implementation of Death Grip, which will stop the target’s spellcast instantly but start the pull a fraction of a second later when the spell connects with its target (even faster than it was for much of 7.2 PTR). This should feel consistent with all of the other attacks Death Knights currently have. We are also adding a few more elements to the visual of Death Grip to bring the vibe closer to the original. The overarching goal of harmonizing mechanics and aesthetics is a very fine needle to thread, but it is one worth fighting for.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for your feedback. See you in Acherus. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753201107?page=7#134))<br />

7.2 Death Knight / Monk Pets and their Acquisition<br />
Hi everyone! Thanks for your feedback, wanted to drop in a few updates/notes.<br />
<br />
In the next build, you'll see that the required currency for each bonus item has dropped from 10000 to 1000 Order Hall Resources. We agree that the &quot;hard part&quot; of getting the bonus items should be maxing out your artifact, not the grind afterwards.<br />
<br />
In 7.2, we want these bonuses to feel like a badge of honor for players that have unlocked the final ability on their empowered artifact. For some time they'll be pretty exclusive, and this is intentional. It makes sense for the Blood Death Knight, with their bloody mount, to also have the Bloodbrood Whelpling, showing off their dedication to their specialization.<br />
<br />
It's also important to note that we also have no plans to remove these items in the future, and we will re-evaluate their acquisition in a post-artifact world. If you don't want to go for them right now, don't worry, you won't be permanently missing out on anything.<br />
<br />
I hope this assuages some of your concerns. As always, we're looking forward to your continued feedback! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/802215-72-dk-monk-pets-and-their-acquisition/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753098752?page=6#120))<br />

Guardian Threat<br />
There are two things going on here:<br />
1) Guardian damage is a little low on the primary target (particularly in a burst context). As people have probably seen on PTR, we're shifting some damage into Mangle in 7.2. However, this isn't enough to account for the &quot;other tank pulled off me immediately after Growl&quot; anecdotes.<br />
2) We're looking into potential bugs that explain that; there may be something inconsistent about the Growl debuff and its threat bonus. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753525184?page=1#4))<br />
<br />
Feral Druid Feedback<br />
Thanks for the constructive feedback here!<br />
<br />
We don't want to make Feral overpowered in single-target just because the priority rotation is more complex. However, we are looking into Feral's singe-target DPS right now, as it is intended to be where Feral is strong.

Mistweaver Talents<br />
In the next PTR build (not today's), Mistweavers will learn Fortifying Brew at level 55. The Windwalker version of this spell is renamed to Fortifying Brew to match, and will continue to be an option at Honor level 22.<br />
<br />
Removing mistwalk because mws are too strong in bgs. Okayyy...But this change destroys mws completely in arenas, when they are not even top performing healers; and giving a 7 min cd fortifying brew instead? are you joking? i get it, you want us all to become your favorite child - druids.<br />
<br />
I doubt it'll be 7 min. The only reason why it's 7min for BrMs is because its CD is reduced with KS/TP. It'll most likely be 2m CD like the WW's.<br />
Currently 90 second cooldown, 15 second duration to match the Windwalker version. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/800832-mistweaver-talents/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753190146?page=12#233))<br />

Protection Paladin Feedback<br />
This is excellent feedback. Concise, actionable, clear, non-hyperbolic. Thank you.<br />
<br />
You mentioned a couple of bugs in here; these are both fixed in current/upcoming 7.2 PTR builds:<br />
<br />
Procs reset the swing timer. This might be a bug but this is the biggest issue with the talent. On paper, the talent should be free damage. However in practice, its actually a DPS loss. The damage lost from the swing timer resets is far more than the damage gained from the damage reflection.<br />
<br />
Judgment of Light<br />
With all three Paladin specs having access to this talent, it no longer makes sense for it not to stack between multiple Paladins. It would be a nice quality of life change if it did.

Legendary Items<br />
which is no different than live. So it’s not worse, just not better for those legendaries, but better for the others<br />
Yep. If you have Norgannon's and Prydaz on a mage of any spec, you have two functional legendaries for that spec. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/834937206586257408))<br />
<br />
The question &quot;Why are Brewmasters the only spec in the game with 2 legendaries in ame armor slot (Belt), Cinidaria &amp; Gai Plin?<br />
Honestly, because we screwed up, but there's no real fix at this point now that both items have been out there for all this time. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/834967323219906560))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Design raid bosses around 54 traits and expect raiders not to farm it? flawed philosophy.. don't do that for ToS please.<br />
Completely agreed though, and Tomb will be different. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/834934266991542273))<br />
<br />
While I agree somewhat about guild expectations being a problem, Krosus and back part of NH feels tuned around 54 traits<br />
Star Augur onwards were indeed tuned for 54, but that's because we looked at the audience and the audience was already at 54. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/835156538650066945))<br />
The damage had been done. (And folks who are in mid-tier Mythic guilds would have several weeks before they get there.) (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/835156758435811328))<br />

It is obvious as to why they do this though. Also how many actually uses friendly nameplates in a raid? All you want to see is the enemy. If you are a healer you are looking at raidframes and not their nameplates either. If there is something important like &quot;stand on player X&quot; then usually that player will be marked with raid markers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guilds were using an addon for friendly name plates that put a bright purple bubble over a player with a debuff. This allowed them to effectively trivialize spread mechanics. While I agree that this seems heavy handed, it seems to be called for in this case.<br />

Blizz doesnt want people to trivialize spread mechanics. Hence the range finder break and now this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, and it's something with a precedent. Back during Icecrown, there was an addon (I forget the name) that used coloured range rings to completely trivialise encounters; and Blizzard broke it for the same reason.<br />
<br />
Honestly?<br />
<br />
I think it's time Blizzard broke all encounter-related boss mods, and then scaled back difficulty in order to compensate. Too many encounters are now testing mod authors rather than players, and that can't be good for the game's health at the entry level to group content.</div></div><hr />

LOL. Really? Turn one into another item? Just remove one from the loot tables? Give anyone with both a pony? free month of playtime? Anything?</div></div><hr />

The OW hero is a very different concept. I like the visuals of it on paper, not so much in game graphics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its hard to tell, as this simply does the freindly nameplates, marking amy still work, but for example making peoples nameplates purple when they have carion plague, will be what is turned off<br />
<br />
<br />
also for those being idiots or not understanding why this is happening or calling blizzard lazy &quot;we cant think of new mechanics so were breaking addons&quot;<br />
<br />
thats not how it works...<br />
<br />
for example archimonde mythic, the lazers, a mechanic they made to be super dificult, as everyone is firing lazers at eachother, this was ment to be very dificult to make it so as little people got hit as possible... but guess what.... addons made it simple<br />
so the issue is they have to come up with harder and harder and harder and harder mechanics, because a hard mechanic, turned into being automated by an addon makes it easy... <br />
<br />
so as addons are made, they are forced to make faster ,and harder mehcanics, over and over, its an arms race, hard fast mechanics are made, addons counter it, and it then become easy peasy, even harder are made, then addons counter it even more... so removing addons allows them to back off and make fights abit easier, without them actually being easier, as they are still hard, but addons cant help<br />
<br />
another example is kromas? (i cant remember, the big elemental dude in HFC) the circles for people to soak was suppose to be a difficult mechanic, everyone has to remember their spot, and go there... but nope, an addon came out that made it trivial &quot;ok go to the arrow&quot; and everyone whent to their arrow, and it was done ,perfect, no problem...</div></div><hr />

Blizzard: &quot;Fine, we'll take away the addons that you're using to cheat the strats.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elitists: &quot;Wah! Now the game is too hard!&quot;<br />
<br />
And so it goes...</div></div><hr />

Not surprising blizzard quality is fucking shit these days. Absolute crap. Look at the class mounts... aside from the shaman mount the rest are just rehashed crap. No love or anything. Blizzard has finally become Microsoft.... just dishing out crap with every expansion. This is a personal insult to all the devs and artists at blizzard... you guys fucking suck! Take some pride in your fucking work. Now its come to stealing other peoples fucking ideas and graphics.</div></div><hr />

If there a would be a server that disables all combat affecting addons i would transfer to it.<br />

complains that things are too easy. It's sadly very similar to how a lot of people sees AP as a number of Maw runs. Highest efficiency. Or how people stopped running BGs in favor of chain-running certain dungeons in MoP when you could convert the boss currency to Honor. Gearing up for PvP by farming PvE.<br />
Players are experts at ruining their own enjoyment and call it &quot;choice&quot;.<br />
<br />
Blizzard giving so much freedom to addons is generally a good thing, but its sad to see that it also allows people to make addons that trivializes raid encounter mechanics, and then you hear people complaining about uninspiring raid bosses. Maybe if you weren't watching addons and arrows telling you where to go and what to do at all times, you'd be more engaged? Nah, can't beat Krosus without an arrow telling me which side to be on, instead of keeping track which side he slammed last using basic memory and visual cues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example I started playing a shadow priest after watching Nihilum vs Illidan video - that cool Mind Flay animation.. and they changed it.<br />
<br />
Now they're doing the same thing with death grip.<br />
<br />
Btw usually their art guys were flawless, but recently I see bad decisions made:<br />
<br />
1) That stressesed outline of a weapon or an NPS first introduced in 4.2. Completely breaks any lest call it &quot;realism-feeling&quot; left in this game. Don't know if I'm the only one hating it.<br />
2) Elven ears piercing steel helmets. The best idea ever. Here I know many people hate it.</div></div><hr />

Designing three bosses on the hardest difficulty around the fact that most of the people who will be fighting it already have a maxed out artifact is now &quot;tuning the game around&quot; it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Most of the people who will be fighting if already have a maxed out artifact&quot; And if they want to be in the group they may need 2-3 of them(depending on the group's needs). That's a big issue for cutting edge guilds that are experiencing burnout due to grinding mains/alts to be raid ready. Their recent statement on this was that that's the Guild Leader's fault... No, it's Blizzard's fault as the game requires that. If the game didn't require it but the guild leaders were THEN it'd be the GL's fault. Welcome to my point.</div></div><hr />
