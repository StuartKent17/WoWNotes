Legendary Drop Rates<br />
The rate at which players acquire Legendary items is a subject that we’ve kept a very close eye on since the launch of Legion. We’ve generally tried to avoid getting into too much technical detail on the system behind your chance to get a Legendary, but we would like to say a bit more on what we’ve done behind-the-scenes up to this point.<br />
<br />
As many players have figured out, changes were made to legendary drop rates with patch 7.1 and patch 7.1.5 – when those patches went live, your chance to receive a Legendary increased in pretty much all cases. What you might not have noticed is that we’ve been steadily increasing your chances since then. One of our long-term goals is to allow you to switch specific Legendary items in and out as the situation warrants, and regularly increasing drop chances is one way of ensuring that that happens.<br />
<br />
We’ve also made adjustments that leveled off what used to be steady decrease to your chance to get subsequent Legendaries after your first. When Legion launched, every time you earned a Legendary, your starting chance to earn your next one would be lower (and thus, the average time it took you to loot it would be longer). At this stage, however, most players in the Broken Isles are no longer hunting for their first Legendary, and many already have their second. We didn’t want you to feel as though your good fortune in the past equates to harder times in the future, so we normalized drop chances for subsequent Legendaries after your second. Right now, in Patch 7.1.5, your first Legendary has the highest drop chance, the second still has a significant bonus, and then you’ll have the same chances to earn your third Legendary as you will your fourth, fifth, sixth, and so on.<br />
<br />
We think it’s important to get this across clearly: it currently takes the same amount of luck/effort to get your third Legendary as it takes to get your eighth. We’ve seen a few players and tools attempting to use historical data to predict their drop chances, but because of how regularly we’ve been increasing Legendary drop rates, that data is extremely outdated – and their conclusions extremely inaccurate. In short, your chance of receiving that next Legendary is probably a lot better than you think.<br />

Patch 7.2 - Unlocking the Obliterum Forge<br />
Patch 7.2 unlocks the Obliterum Forge for everyone at no cost! There is a single intro quest (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/41778-firing-up-the-forge) that gives you one free Obliterum (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124125-obliterum) as well.<br />

Ending Support for Windows XP and Vista<br />
Starting later this year, we will begin the process of ending support for Windows XP and Windows Vista in World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, Diablo III, Hearthstone, and Heroes of the Storm. Microsoft ceased mainstream support for these versions of Windows in 2009 and 2012, respectively, but since a decent portion of our audience was still using them at the time, we continued supporting them. However, there have been three major Windows releases since Vista, and at this point, the vast majority of our audience has upgraded to one of the newer versions.<br />
<br />
After these older operating systems are no longer supported, the games will not run on them, so we encourage any players who are still using one of the older OSes to upgrade to a newer version. We’ll be rolling out this change on a staggered schedule, and will post further notices as we get closer to making the change for each game.<br />

Patch 7.2 - New Artifact Traits<br />
The new traits that are replacing the 20-point trait on PTR (e.g. Instability of the Tirisgarde (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/241124-instability-of-the-tirisgarde) ) will affect all damage, including for specs that didn't get that benefit from the previous version. That still leaves the initial 5% 35-point trait that still exists, but that's no more than a 5% swing in the value of trinkets.

Arcane T20 set bonus<br />
We're considering making the set bonus work with some spell other than Greater Invisibility, to avoid overloading a utility button with a rotational DPS benefit.

PvP<br />
Battleground matchmaking has been region wide for awhile, not battlegroups. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830332989116518400))<br />
In each region, one faction does tend to have more people queuing than the other. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830333198198386688))<br />
e,g, NA tends to have more Horde, EU tends to have more Alliance. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830333501475999745))<br />
Alliance vs Horde in BGs super important. Striving to keep it and get better balance. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830333975524630528))<br />
how?<br />
We now reward end of season titles (Gladiator, etc) to top % of each faction. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830338102447071232))<br />
Over time (many seasons) hope to see top players spread between both factions. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830338212417593346))<br />
Incentivize players on less represented faction to play more. https://t.co/K73XuI2Gv2 (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830338458719707136))<br />
surely that just fills the ranks with more casual players?<br />
Not necessarily. Works for Mercenaries too. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830339966836224000))<br />

I guess i'm just an incredibly unlucky person, given I don't have any legendary yet. It's not that one can't enjoy the game without a legendary, it's that everytime you do a daily or w/e you just kick yourself and after a while you don't have any interest, whatsoever anymore.</div></div><hr />

To be fair in pve the dps always have the habit of making some fights dps races , thats fun and healthy competition that at times pushes people more to achieve their best.Now if you were unlucky on the Ledgendary drop and your fellow mage was lucky ,you were screwed big time in this friendly competition . As having , lets say 2 utility ones equiped is a huge nerf to having 2 dps ones equiped .Most of us dont like powerfull items like this being gated behind double RNG .By now all dps should have atleast 1 dps ledgendary instead of 5 utility ones in some bad luck cases .Make a trader , trade two crap for 1 token , or something in that nature .</div></div><hr />

This is why most game companies don't talk about the ideas they have. Because there's always that guy who claims they were promised something.<br />
<br />
At Blizzcon during the Q&amp;A session they said they were &quot;looking into&quot; a way to target a legendary. They never expanded upon the idea nor ever told anyone that it was a thing they were for sure going to do. Just that it was something on the table that they were considering figuring out a way to do.</div></div><hr />

You're doing basically the minimum requirement to get a Legendary. Emissary cache is on the low end of Legendary drop rates, you need to do raids and multiple M+ each week to up your odds. You shouldn't be surprised that you only have 2 Legendaries.</div></div><hr />

Bad excuse. Legendaries have been nerfed to the ground for many specs. Sure if you're hardcore raiding it might be correct, but any semi-hardcore raider will be absolutely fine without the best legendaries. I play shadow priest and the difference between the best legendary and prydaz is like 3%. Other classes might have larger gaps, but still it's not a big deal. And if you are hardcore raider you should have 7-8 legendaries anyway by now so you should be able to choose freely, if not now, at least very soon given how the legendary system works.</div></div><hr />

You're mixing doing more stuff with &quot;low end&quot;. Emissary cache is not a lower chance than raids/m+.<br />
<br />
They're all just &quot;another chance&quot; at getting it.<br />

Dude, prydaz is just a stat stick basically (and as an acessory, without int/agi/str). Unless the best SP legendary is another stat stick (and another acessory to not have int on it), it won't be &quot;3%&quot;. Every class/spec has at least one legendary that bumps your dps by a huge margin.<br />

<br />
It's just RNG at really low success chance (with increased chance on your 1st and 2nd one according to Blizzard).<br />
<br />
Playing since Legion's launch, doing raids, caches, m+, and only got my 3rd last week from a raid boss (and crappy generic one, just like the other two). Actually none of my 110 characters (5) actually have a good (or bis) legendary for their spec/classes, they're all generic (a bunch of Prydaz and Sephuz...)<br />
<br />
Yet, there are people that got one while still leveling to 110.</div></div><hr />

Then you're basically clueless. Check https://howtopriest.com/viewtopic.php?f=75&amp;t=9474<br />
<br />
Best legendary boosts dmg by roughly 6% while prydaz boosts dmg by roughly 3%. Most other legendaries are about equal to prydaz or just slightly better.</div></div><hr />

25 chests isn't very many. If you are only doing those, then you'd have to be considered really lucky to have gotten one in only 25.</div></div><hr />
