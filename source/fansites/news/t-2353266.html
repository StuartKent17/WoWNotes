PTR Development Notes Build 25700<br />
This week, we’ve implemented a new build that primarily brings bugfixes to the PTR. Our biggest focus for testing remains the new level 1-100 zone and dungeon scaling we’re introducing with 7.3.5. This is an extensive change to how loot, quests, and creatures work in the open world, so we continue to look for as much feedback as we can get about how things are working out.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for all of the feedback you’ve provided so far on leveling in Azeroth. We hope you keep the feedback coming, and we’d like to ask you to especially focus some of your testing on the questlines in these specific zones:<br />
<br />
<br />
Blade's Edge Mountains<br />
Duskwood<br />
Hellfire Peninsula<br />
Icecrown<br />
Kun-Lai Summit<br />
Nagrand<br />
Storm Peaks<br />
Terokkar Forest<br />
Vashj'ir<br />
Wetlands<br />
<br />
<br />
Feedback on the difficulty, pacing, and most importantly, any bugs you might find while completing quests in the above zones would be most helpful. Please post your level scaling feedback here (https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/22814288/).<br />
<br />
We now have Ulduar Timewalking available for testing, and it should be available for the next four days or so. Please post Ulduar Timewalking feedback here (https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20760535983).<br />
<br />
Also, a heads up—We’re planning a scheduled playtest of the new Seething Shore PvP Battleground. Get ready to Play With The Blues on the PTR on Tuesday, December 19 from 2:00 – 4:00 p.m. PST. The Seething Shore is a 10v10 race to gather Azerite on an island near Silithus, and we hope you’ll be able to join us there and test it thoroughly on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
As always, thank you very much for participating in the PTR!<br />
<br />

Method World First Kill<br />
Congrats to Method! It's been interesting watching everyone compete for the World First, and It's awesome to see Method pull through. We will be watching for the World Second and World Third, so good luck to everyone else going for the kill!<br />
<br />
Boss got nerfed cause they suck, nothing new to see here.<br />
The boss hasn't been touched In the last couple of days besides some minor bug fixes, so all the latest attempts have definitely been legitimately difficult, but good try! <br />
<br />
Efficiency has nothing todo with it, its like saying the todays Warriors are a better basketball team than the 90's Bulls, its still a video game where you move and press 1,2,3,4, this isnt nuclear enginnering, not taking away the current players skills, but one cannot say people werent skilled ages ago if they still spent nearly 15+ hours a day playing a game<br />
I can guarantee you with all the money in the known universe that people are better raiders today than from Vanilla.<br />
<br />
100%. Professional raiding as well as raid design have evolved a ton since those days, they are hardly comparable at this point imo.<br />
<br />
Ragnaros took 120 days, this is easy in comparison<br />
<br />
People also didn’t play 24/h a day 7 days. Week on rotating shifts trying everything in their power to get it.<br />
<br />
Or have PTR research, or datamining, or have multiple characters for any scenario of mechanical differences. The list goes on. Higher end raiders while a very fraction of a percent are far more skilled in how they approach fights than they were during Vanilla and even Burning Crusade encounters. <br />
<br />
If you dropped a fight like Argus during something like Vanilla with no previous history of encounters or the tools that higher end raiders have now, I think you'd see him live for quite a long time.<br />
<br />
Okay, we care why?<br />
<br />
More people should care. The world first races are fun to follow for a number of reasons. If you're (general you, I mean) one of those people who is salty about raiding in general, then by all means stay away; but for someone who knows even the slightest bit about how raiding works, following along with the MMO-Champion mythic progression thread for each raid is by turns fascinating and hilarious. <br />
Fascinating because I will never see mythic progression, just like I won't ever play professional football, but I can read the commentary of the various hardcore raiders that contribute to that thread just like I can watch pro ball. Hilarious because sometimes there's more bickering and drama in these extreme high-end raiding guilds than you see in any RP guild.<br />
It's just that, entertainment. However, it's not some peoples cup of tea and that's fine. I personally get super excited about it and love to talk about the race around the office. We even watch some of players that stream it, the rare few that is. It's also a sense of pride, being a player that used to participate in this, seeing it continue through all of the new raid tiers we add. <br />
<br />
Even though I'm not a hardcore raider in any sense, I always notice that people on the forums get triggered badly whenever impressive PVE or PVP accomplishments are mentioned in anyway.<br />
Some people get mad seeing things they haven't accomplished like this. We'd have a few more raiders if they weren't so busy posting angrily on the forums about other player's accomplishments. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1079292-method-took-it/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20760565965?page=5#97))<br />
<br />
Tame Beast and Trinket Procs<br />
Your feedback has been heard, and we agree.<br />
<br />
We're working on a hotfix that should prevent Tame Beast from triggering trinket procs.<br />
<br />

<br />
During Vanilla and BC raiding was more about assigned jobs, and performing that job perfectly. In those days there was little RNG in the game, so a kill was almost only depending on the level of execution. You have progressed in those fights step-by-step, because you could predict the course of the fight.<br />
<br />
In Legion two consecutive pulls can be completely different even from the first second depending on who gets debuffed. Because of this you may wipe at 90%, and get to 10% on the next try. One lucky proc on a skill/trinket/enchant can change the course of the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having raided near the cutting edge then, and doing mythics now, I can say that the biggest difference that I see is due to some specific design choices that end up with the stated situation. Back in TBC, fights were really about tight tuning. There were some complex mechanics, and execution was important for them, but the fights in general were really about forcing people to min/max and get as geared as possible prior to being able to progress past certain bosses, even to the point of stacking specific classes and specs in extreme manners for world firsts.<br />
<br />
That kind of fight design really started to change in WotLK, especially with the release of Ulduar Hard Modes. On modern fights, that level of gearing and extreme min/maxing/spec stacking isn't nearly as important (or even really possible, in the case of some of the min/maxing stuff you had to go through), and it's much more about correctly executing on far more complex mechanics, while still outputting at a certain necessary level. For cutting edge progression, there is still pretty tight tuning, but not at the level for fights like M'uru back in the day.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think this leads to better encounters, and has lead to more skilled raiders over all, since it forces people to act and react individually, as opposed to just following their class cookie cutters and what the theorycrafters are saying. Sometimes I do miss having bosses that I can just blow up on... but honestly, I think people are going to go back to the Vanilla raids when WoW Classic comes out and be massively disappointed by what they experience. As someone who raided from MC through Burning Throne, while there have been hits and misses on individual raids and bosses, raids as a whole have just been steadily improving as the game has aged.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiren</div><div class="date">2017-12-15, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder if Blizzard could (would want) to hide stuff from dataminers..

Due to that I wish Blizzard would add more secret bosses like Ra-den was.<br />
<br />
Same goes for the story, it's not nice to know how the story ends before you can experience it yourself. And come on, it's really hard to avoid all the spoilers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have hidden information before, although I don't think it was bosses/abilities, so I'm not sure if there's a limit on what information they can hide due to the way data is structured, etc., but I think one of the bigger issues is just with beta testing in general (and in a nearly unavoidable way). They have gotten much better on their internal test team with finding bugs and unintentional interactions over the past decade, but the fact remains that bosses that don't get beta tested at all also tend to turn up big, unintentional bugs during progression. That's just one of the trade offs between beta testing and not that they've talked about before. Unfortunately, there's just not very much you can do about it either. If they enough time testing internally to gather the same information they get from just one round of beta testing, it would probably take years for us to see some of these bosses, if we ever saw them. Maybe sometimes they decide that it's worth outcome to not spoil a particularly awesome boss, or that they can for sure get certain phases of bosses out bug free without beta testing, but doing it for the whole raid is just not feasible while maintaining the high level of quality and polish that Blizzard's end-game offerings are known for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And to get to Ragnaros in MC back in vanilla, you needed to not only kill the other bosses, but you needed to put special water on the runes, which was rep gated. <br />
<br />
Some people just want to feel like vanilla was the hardest thing in the world, when it wasn't. The bosses were mostly mechanically simple. Experience does play a factor, which was addressed in the blue post. <br />
<br />
Like blizzard said, if they put something like mythic Argus or even Mythic Kil'jaeden as a boss in vanilla and had vanilla players try and do it, it would take a very long time.<br />

They have hidden information before, although I don't think it was bosses/abilities, so I'm not sure if there's a limit on what information they can hide due to the way data is structured, etc., but I think one of the bigger issues is just with beta testing in general (and in a nearly unavoidable way). They have gotten much better on their internal test team with finding bugs and unintentional interactions over the past decade, but the fact remains that bosses that don't get beta tested at all also tend to turn up big, unintentional bugs during progression. That's just one of the trade offs between beta testing and not that they've talked about before. Unfortunately, there's just not very much you can do about it either. If they enough time testing internally to gather the same information they get from just one round of beta testing, it would probably take years for us to see some of these bosses, if we ever saw them.

Sometimes you get mythic bosses that were tested on the beta / PTR and they still provide a challenge on live. Mythic Avatar in ToS is the most recent example. Prior to that was Butcher in Highmaul. Butcher was the last boss Paragon killed to gain world first Highmaul. There is a reason why they skipped it and went to Mar'gok.</div></div><hr />

All they have to do is add a personal dps meter and a /countdown and they can safely delete all other non-graphical UI addons. Can't fathom why the developers even waste effort enabling addon creators instead of just saying &quot;no that's not ok&quot; and deleting it. Boohoo people can't use an addon. No better than using a Health Display &quot;addon&quot; in Monster Hunter games and completely trivializing it.<br />
<br />
With all the money Blizzard has they shouldn't even need a PTR for any reason. What do we pay subscription fees for? To pay them to debug their own fucking game?<br />
<br />
Blizzards garbage argument about &quot;bosses now will be too difficult then&quot;. Why? Have these retards never played your average PS1/PS2 fantasy action game before? Do they really think people need timers and shit to play a game? Fucking laughable. They use those tools to make it easier and the devs blame the tools instead of banning them. Devs are lazy coasting fools destroying a franchise to project their garbage ideas at the expense of an existing fanbase.</div></div><hr />

What crawled up your ass? <br />
<br />
Some people never cease to amaze me in posting something to completely detached from what was said that it makes regular strawmen blush. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think you're asserting that bosses from vanilla/BC were &quot;more difficult&quot; than ones now... maybe? Which obviously isn't true. <br />
<br />
They aren't infringing on the EULA in any way. A timer that counts down after a boss uses an ability is just that... a timer. It doesn't hack the game or any such nonsense; I don't even have the slightest idea of what you're trying to imply.<br />
<br />
knowing when an ability occurs isn't something that instantly trivializes a fight, seeing as you still have to work around whatever that ability is. <br />
<br />
As far as debugging, Blizzard can't run the dozens of tests with all the classes and tease out whether there are bugs unless they actually have people doing that, and they don't pay hundreds of people just to &quot;play their game.&quot; Programmers have an actual job of... you know, programming, that they need to do. <br />
<br />
And I honestly don't know why you even bring up PS1 games. Yeah, sure, let's compare crash bandicoot or FF7 to WoW. I mean why can't they make WoW more turn-based or platforming, right?</div></div><hr />
