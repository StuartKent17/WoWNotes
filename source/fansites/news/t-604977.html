Sunwell Armor Sets v2.0<br />
Wait, I already posted these screenshots ! Yes but I actually had a slight bug that &quot;removed&quot; all the particle effects from the armors, most of the people on this site are VERY interested in these armors so I figured out it would be a good idea to do proper screenshots.<br />

vis maior just have had luck or maybe some support <br />
<br />
nevermind, sunwell encounters are not that hard<br />
until today 2.4 was no real competition<br />
<br />
every guild with 25 ppl on ptr killed 3 sunwell bosses within 1-2 days<br />
how can anyone call this &quot;firstkill&quot; if there isnt anything hard to kill?^^</div></div><hr />

They are INFORMING that they killed the boss.<br />

I count four references to &quot;world first&quot; on their home page, if that's not bragging I'm not sure what is ;D</div></div><hr />

I am pretty sure the way Blizzard has handled Sunwell will cause shitloads of people to quit the game, since this is probably a good estimation of have poorly they will handle any new expansions...<br />

Wow, you're new here, aren't you? Blizz didn't let players test BWL... that was the end of their fully internal testing phase, seeing as it was one of the worst releases that they have ever turned out. about 1/2 of hyjal and BT were downed on the 2.2 PTR. I believe ZA was cleared on the 2.3 ptr in about 2 days. NOTHING from this patch is different from previous patches in the least bit, except for the progressive testing change, which has only been for the good so far. (By the way, GMs deathtouching bosses is nothing new. They want to test mechanics on ALL the bosses they can, and they don't care about people learning how to farm a fight. They will follow a guild that is likely to do well testing mechanics on a boss, such as Vis Maior, and death touch bosses when they want boss mechanics from later bosses to be tested. This is nothing new, and has only helped them. Why do you think Hyjal/BT were probably the most polished raids ever released? Because of these exact testing methods.) Anyways, quit your bitching and go away.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, the Grip of Mannoroth, I think it's displaying wrong. My fist weapon senses say it's backwards, and the two prongs, one of which is shooting up the arm of the human, are the blades. It kinda reminds me of the shaman fist weapons SS.<br />

your pretty sure ? /fail<br />

agree with ppl who posted above me - bt / hyjal were very polished. deathtouching = less time we have to wait to get the new content.<br />

Well, my guild has been farming BT for many months, and there are loads of people very close to quitting atm, for whom Sunwell is the only thing that will prevent that.<br />
<br />
Having all the content cleared on the testservers is just failure imo.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but since I have been around since MC, it will take more than your lame comments to go away ^^<br />
<br />
And I will voice my oppinion here, where or not you agree or not, I honestly could not care less.<br />
<br />
Most of my guild feel as I, that the centent getting cleared on test-servers (where its mostly luckbased who get to clear anything or not) is the wrong way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Problem with this theory is that Kil'jaeden kill is really based on your server as a whole not just 1 guild so whoever has the most guilds farming sunwell content everyweek will get the first kill.</div></div><hr />

Kilrogg, a PvE server on the Bloodlust battlegroup isn't widely known, but we have an overall above average standing, being a release server. Hell, Conquest, the top Alliance guild, is closely tied to Curse. However, we took a REALLY, REALLY poor position in both the AQ and Naxx events =P<br />
<br />
Only time will tell who nails 'Jaeden first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Just look at it's itemlevel...<br />
Can't be possible that this neck drops from this boss.<br />
Just seems too odd.</div></div><hr />
