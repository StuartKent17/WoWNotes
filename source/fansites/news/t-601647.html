<br />
Features summary from WoWSzene.de FAQ (http://www.wowszene.de/news.php?extend.1182) :<br />
The expansion is Northrend, etc, etc.<br />
We will fight Arthas himself.<br />
Level cap is 80 (New skills, new talents, etc)<br />
The expansion is designed for lvl 68 and higher players.<br />
The Death Knight class will be available for both alliance and horde players and it seems to work on the same mechanics as Jedi in SWG, you can create them once certain criteria are met. (First hero class of the game)<br />
The Death Knight will combine damage dealing and tanking.<br />
Siege weapons and destructible buildings will be added to PvP<br />
A new battleground will be available<br />
New profession : Inscription. (allows the player to permanently enhance their spells and abilities and to create mysterious items of power to use, trade, and sell.)<br />
More hero classes will be added in the future<br />
Leveling from 70 to 80 should took nearly the same time as 60 to 70 (probably a bit more)<br />
First zone will be Howling Fjord<br />
We should have roughly the same amount of dungeons as what we had in BC<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Informations from other source :<br />
The level cap at Blizzcon will be set to 72 (It will be 80 at the release, of course)<br />
Utgarde Keep should be one of the first dungeon you can access, and the first wing will be playable at Blizzcon.<br />
Horde players will be able to access Northrend by taking a Zeppelin in Tirisfal Glades, they will arrive at Vengeance Landing in Howling Fjord. (This wasn't mentionned, but we can assume that Alliance players will arrive at Valgarde)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Good news for fans who didn't make it to BlizzCon this year but still would like to check out the event: Giga (http://www.giga.de/2/live/free/) will be providing live coverage from BlizzCon in the form of a live video stream. Coverage will include the StarCraft, Warcraft III and World of Warcraft Arena tournaments, and much more. You will need to download the Octoshape plug-in (http://www.giga.de/2/live/free/) to access the stream.<br />
<br />
Frostmourne<br />
This isn't something new because it seems it was published June 5th, Frostmourne is trademarked too ! <br />

2.2 PTR Patch<br />
Remember ? There is a PTR Patch going. It seems that I missed a few monsters in it, but Endarion was here to save the day. Thanks to him for the nice screenshots ^^<br />
I don't know where the Headless Horseman will be used, but the Brewfest Ram will probably be used to race. (See the news about the Brewfest)<br />

<br />
Why do they keep saying &quot;Arthas&quot; and not the Lich King?<br />
<br />
They are one and the same, and it seems that Arthas' personality is the one that came out dominant (and it's his body, n'est-ce pas?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt his mind overtook the Lich King's but yea, I guess since it's Arthas's body, they call him that, he's both really, so you can call him both, or &quot;little flower in the frozen wind&quot; if you want, doesn't matter, I'm still gonna try to wtfpwn his ass asap ^.^</div></div><hr />
