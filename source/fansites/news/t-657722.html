Trading Card Mounts no longer Bind on Pickup in 3.2?<br />
Let me start this news with a small disclaimer, this information is absolutely NOT confirmed by Blizzard for the moment and I will not be responsible if you decide to do stupid things after reading it. <br />
<br />
While I was checking a few things on PTRs, a very interesting change showed up on my screen : the Spectral Tiger mount wasn't bound on pickup anymore. I decided to investigate a little more and realized that most of the TCG mounts had their bind removed. (Except for the turtle)<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/july/patch32tcgmount_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/july/patch32tcgmount.jpg)<br />
<br />
I didn't want to news it earlier because it could have been a bug but apparently, the interface to redeem TCG codes was slightly changed and the Spectral Tiger mounts seem to have different codes for the normal and the swift version.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Hopefully we'll hear from Blizzard about this very soon. <br />

this might be true, but the promotions are rare as it is. so you'd have to spend lots of money and then be lucky.<br />

True.. maybe this is just a funny touch for the PTR only? :p as a joke or for more people to test/have fun with mounts :o?<br />

<br />
1. Mount cards currently sell for $350-1200.<br />
2. The gold is legally earned. Botted gold is what they're against.</div></div><hr />

Or those people living in a country where they dont sell TCG cards, like here in Denmark. My only option would be to order a whole box home from US and A, and then get lucky.. :-\<br />

And I really hope they make them BoA, I always though it would be stupid otherwise.. In the end its the same person sitting behind the screen, why not let him show off on each character..</div></div><hr />

When they changed hymn of hope, they removed it from the game before putting it back in. Same thing with Divine Hymn. Incremental changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, living in Denmark and getting a box from the US would be a stupid thing to do, as the US codes aren't redeemable on EU servers and vice versa.<br />
<br />
Better try getting an uk or even german version, cause a little german shouldn't bother you if you're just after the code itself. ^^</div></div><hr />

This will work only for items obtained in an instance and/or group, where you will be able to trade it with others with the same &quot;kill ID&quot; as you.<br />
<br />
And I can't see how anyone else besides you would get that ID when you put in that code. ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Occam's Razor in motion:<br />
<br />
Blizzard Introduces TCG Codes.<br />
Scammers discover TCG Codes are a great way to make a ton of money.<br />
Blizzard Gets Grumpy at devoting man hours to reverting scams involving in-game money for an item someone never gets. <br />
Scammers take it to the next level and even chain-scam accounts using phisher websites.<br />
Blizzard sighs, spends way too many man hours solving the issue of compromised accounts due to TCG Codes.<br />
<br />
easy solution: non-binding TCG rewards so you don't have someone scambaiting for a code. <br />
<br />
None of this at all has anything whatsoever to do with the fact that you picked the wrong character to spend a $1200 mount. <br />
<br />
Sorry. <br />
<br />
Lots of these changes are for Blizzard's benefit, not yours. trade-able raid drops are for the ability to let GM's not waste their day on &quot;lol masterlooter screwed up after this guy paid me 1200g to give him a tier piece lol&quot; problems. Tradeable TCG codes are so account admins and GM's don't waste their entire time on TCG related scams. <br />
<br />
and to clarify a misconception, the cards are sold by Upper Deck, not Blizzard. Blizzard gets royalty money but considering the margins on TCG's these days they're not hauling in boatloads of money off the TCG, it's just helping the bottom line. This is why Blizzard doesn't feel it necessary to spend thousands of man hours of their budget solving a problem given to them by another company. Royalties probably aren't making up for the GM salary devoted to fixing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Probably because this is something that is very easily a bug. Whereas when every existing Hallow mask is a player-race and they add in four new masks for two races with a male/female each, it's either purposeful misdirection or true. I mean, have you ever even seen a female worgen in game? They simply don't exist, so why would we be dressing up as them?</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is obviously NOT gonna make em BoE.<br />
<br />
While changing the item so it could be used on level 40 (instead of 60) and level 20 (instead of 40),there was made a mistake. <br />
While they were working on the item code (or whatever) they forgot to make it BoP.<br />
<br />
Reason for me thinking this: <br />
The turtle doesn't require a level to use, so there was no need to change the item, so they didn't make a mistake.<br />
If they're planning on making all the mounts BoE... why skip the turtle?</div></div><hr />

But I am for the idea of selling mounts in WoW. It should at least cut down on some scams of people saying they are selling Sprectral Tiger mount. Now you can straight up say show me and when they can't no more need to deal with them BSing.

My only option would be to order a whole box home from US and A, and then get lucky.. :-\<br />
<br />
And I really hope they make them BoA, I always though it would be stupid otherwise.. In the end its the same person sitting behind the screen, why not let him show off on each character.. <br />
<br />
<br />
You must either live in a small village with the nearest shop to be a farm shop, or either you have not checked your options.<br />
<br />
- I live in Denmark, Copenhagen and I can go to the nearest book store to buy the TCG with at least 4-5 options to pick between.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is obviously NOT gonna make em BoE.<br />
<br />
While changing the item so it could be used on level 40 (instead of 60) and level 20 (instead of 40),there was made a mistake. <br />
While they were working on the item code (or whatever) they forgot to make it BoP.<br />
<br />
Reason for me thinking this: <br />
The turtle doesn't require a level to use, so there was no need to change the item, so they didn't make a mistake.<br />
If they're planning on making all the mounts BoE... why skip the turtle?<br />

<br />
This is obviously the most logical reason. There probably is a small possibility of them becoming BoA, but the main reason they show up as BoE is probably because they forgot to include that tooltip in when changing the req levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, you're not buying from Blizzard, but from the guy on Ebay, who maybe spent, dunno, how much are booster displays these days? Considerably less, though. And most of that money probably stays at the company that produces the TCG, only a small licensing (probably static, not depending on actual sales) fee goes to Blizzard. Small when looking at a single booster display, of course.</div></div><hr />

i can see them doing this because spec tiger etc. sell for 500-800 easy which is f'n ridiculous.. these mounts shouldn't cost THIS much money.. and if this does they wont go for 30k gold because it will lose its value, i expect maybe 12-15k tops at start and 6-12 months down the road even cheaper</div></div><hr />

I think this is one of the big reasons or THE reason why Blizz is changing it. Those scammers pretty much only sell TCG mounts. I haven't seen a scammer sell a TCG item in a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Wrong. They did intend to fully remove the HoH from the game. But priests complained so Blizzard redesigned it and put it back in.<br />
<br />
That said, I do think they will probably make these BoA as Blizzard has stated they want to make all promotional items like Blizzcon stuff or CE pets BOA. And these TCG items certainly fall in that category. Though I would love to have one of these mounts without having to blow a wad of cash on eBay.</div></div><hr />

They cay earn more money now by selling it on AH, even if the price would be 200+k gold. For top guilds pay 200k gold not a big problem.<br />
<br />
Here is the formula how focking goldsellers may earn more money for tiger:<br />
<br />
Z=x/y<br />
E=Z*1,5<br />
<br />
Where:<br />
X - Price for Spectral in $<br />
y - price for 1k gold in $<br />
z - real price for Spectral in gold<br />
E - AH price for Spectral <br />
<br />
That mean if real price for tiger 1000$,gold sellers will earn from trade it by using AH will get 1500$ in total. <br />
You could say no1 buy it? HA HA - and i repead that for top guilds - gold nothing more, nothing less then just a peace of bull$hit.<br />

This. Someone said they'd become cheaper over time, but that is hardly the case. They'll start at several 100K, then go up to several dozen millions.</div></div><hr />

The mounts will be around 25-50k gold with 50k gold there are guild who sell u the glory of the ulduar(heroic) drake achievements...<br />

You're an idiot, you contradicted your first paragraph...<br />
You also don't realise that the people who spent real life money to get these deserve them for spending that money on other Warcraft trademark items, that's why Blizzard did the cards in the first place, as a reward for those who fund them in another way. Selling them in-game just seems ridiculous to me... It would ruin the point of TCG loot cards, and tbh, I don't think Upper Deck would be happy with this, as they're the ones who make the cards and also make a profit from them.</div></div><hr />

Guaranteed.<br />
<br />
For those of us who play the minis game or just collect them it's actually really easy to end up with multiple mount cards. My husband managed to get two bear mounts for him and myself in just a few boxes.<br />
<br />
If we kept trying to fill out that set, we might end up with 2-3 more mounts and what are we to do with those? <br />
<br />
Sell them on ebay, where if you have no ranking no one will buy your stuff?<br />
<br />
Sell them on WoW, where everyone and their brother will report you for scamming?<br />
<br />
Give them away to friends who may then turn around and use the code for profit (not to say I don't trust my friends, but if they've got the ebay ranking to do it, why wouldn't they)?<br />
<br />
Or heck, why don't they make the stupid things BOE so we can get rid of our extras on WoW?<br />
<br />
Makes sense to me. I have some party grenades I'll NEVER use just sitting on my desk here. I hope that they'll be BOE (they come in a box, I believe)and I can just sell them and make some gold.</div></div><hr />

it would probably take them 10 seconds to make any pre 3.2 mounts that werent used deprecated and make a spectral tiger mount with a new id, which im assuming is what they will do</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you found a Spectral Tiger or rocket mount for $100 in the first place, then you deserve 30k gold for being that damn lucky.<br />
<br />
I see one of two things happening. One, at least 1% of the WoW playerbase going broke IRL to buy these things and this change doesn't go through (cuz you know, the big red disclaimer wasn't there amirite), or two, this is a way to increase sales of their card game, which isn't incredibly popular.</div></div><hr />

U wont have an infinite amount of gold. U will only can get them ounce on your char.<br />
U cant keep buying htem when u sold one, but what u can o is buy an amount of them before 3.2 will go live and then just sell those.<br />
<br />
btw, i will wait then other they are so expensive for me to buy ima just go buy the chicken :P</div></div><hr />

Once you get the card and use it you open up the vendor option and you're able to buy both versions of the spectral tigers whenever you like. The vendor is linked to your (EU or US) account.</div></div><hr />

Oh god, I can already see the posts when 3.2 goes live with those mounts being BoP again:<br />
&quot;Waaaaah but you promised us* that they would be BoE, I got two dozens of those mounts, on one character, and now I can't use them!&quot;<br />

And I really hope they make them BoA, I always though it would be stupid otherwise.. In the end its the same person sitting behind the screen, why not let him show off on each character.. <br />

I copied accross my character and went and checked out Lando. The Options have changed and you now need to enter a code to get either a Normal or a Swift Version of the Tiger.

<br />
So I logged back into live and I purchased two tigers. I copied accross again and hearthed to Dalaran. The tigers were not BOP. I found a random druid and traded him the tiger. It worked with no issues. He used it and then mounted up.<br />
<br />
I found another random person and gave them my other tiger - it also worked fine and they activated it and used it.<br />
<br />
So I guess if I bought 10 tigers I could essentially sell them once the patch goes live - but would this be considered an exploit of game mechanics or the economy? I would not like to get banned or get in trouble.<br />

I am more tempted to just buy a few for my alts and not take the risk in selling them - but to have them on my other guys would be quite nice.</div></div><hr />

Well since they are Unique at the moment it you would only be able to purchase 1 swift and 1 normal.. And as soon as 3.2 hits the mounts will be locked and you are only able to purchase them again by getting another card. This also at the moment prevents player from stockpiling them.</div></div><hr />

Except you're wrong on the Spectral :) The Chicken and Battle Bear are both unique, but the spectrals [both epic and non] are currently not flagged as unique at all.</div></div><hr />

I took the risc :)<br />
Bought 20 Swift Spectral Tigers, and put em in my Bank... 3 things might happen:<br />
<br />
1.) They become Bind on Account, which would be a GREAT thing, since the mount<br />
stays rare as it is now... and my twinks will be happy about it :)<br />
<br />
2.) They become BoE which would also be great, but we gonna see a shitload of<br />
those Mounts in the near Future. My Twinks get one each, rest i sell for 20k a pop^^<br />
<br />
3.) Everything stays as usual, Mount will be BoP in 3.2...and ive just blew 2k gold.<br />
<br />
Its a WIN WIN LOSE situation for me... 66% WIN = Worth the risc :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Spectral Tiger is now Unique. I also could not trade it to anyone else - I tried to give one of them to a nearby Druid at the bank and it appears in the cannot be traded slot.<br />
I however already have learnt both versions of the mount as I own it on live so perhaps if your character does NOT know the mount they could trade it to someone else.<br />

People that did not know that a spectral tiger hardly is worth 500 or even 5K, will also not know that spectral tigers can be traded even after redeeming the code, and will click on URLs given by the scammers, and enter their login info...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omanley</div><div class="date">2009-07-26, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you guys who think they're going to be (or should be) BOA need to stop projecting your desires on a change that's probably being done for reasons that aren't yours.<br />
<br />
Occam's Razor in motion:<br />
<br />
Blizzard Introduces TCG Codes.<br />
Scammers discover TCG Codes are a great way to make a ton of money.<br />
Blizzard Gets Grumpy at devoting man hours to reverting scams involving in-game money for an item someone never gets. <br />
Scammers take it to the next level and even chain-scam accounts using phisher websites.<br />
Blizzard sighs, spends way too many man hours solving the issue of compromised accounts due to TCG Codes.<br />
<br />
easy solution: non-binding TCG rewards so you don't have someone scambaiting for a code. <br />
<br />
None of this at all has anything whatsoever to do with the fact that you picked the wrong character to spend a $1200 mount. <br />
<br />
Sorry. <br />
<br />
Lots of these changes are for Blizzard's benefit, not yours. trade-able raid drops are for the ability to let GM's not waste their day on &quot;lol masterlooter screwed up after this guy paid me 1200g to give him a tier piece lol&quot; problems. Tradeable TCG codes are so account admins and GM's don't waste their entire time on TCG related scams. <br />
<br />
and to clarify a misconception, the cards are sold by Upper Deck, not Blizzard. Blizzard gets royalty money but considering the margins on TCG's these days they're not hauling in boatloads of money off the TCG, it's just helping the bottom line. This is why Blizzard doesn't feel it necessary to spend thousands of man hours of their budget solving a problem given to them by another company. Royalties probably aren't making up for the GM salary devoted to fixing it. <br />

<br />
Only if you still have the item on that character, say if you didn't use it to &quot;learn&quot; the mount after 3.0<br />
<br />
...and if the old items don't just stay BoP, I heard the spells creating those items were changed to point to different Item-IDs in the last build. That the old items are BoE on the PTR doesn't mean they'll be the BoE ones on Live, too.<br />
And yes, that probably means a lot of QQ from the people who stocked up on lots of &quot;old&quot; tiger items, only to then not being able to get even one of the new items.</div></div><hr />
