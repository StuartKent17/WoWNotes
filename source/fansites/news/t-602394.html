All seasons arena sets bonuses merged<br />
A very interesting change, you can wear parts of the gladiator sets and get the bonuses even if they're from different seasons. Obviously this also means that you won't be able to stack two +35 Resilience bonuses anymore. Old sets bonuses will be changed to new ones.<br />
As of patch 2.3 all items in the gladiator season 1, 2, and 3 sets will be part of the same set, so you can use those items interchangably and keep the set bonuses (ie: you can wear the season 2 shoulders along with the season 3 helm, chest, legs) and retain the 4 piece set bonus.<br />
<br />
Q: You had better be changing the 4pc set bonus then, -1 second of concussive shot is absolutely horrible and no way better than +35 resilience :/<br />
A: Many of the set bonuses have been updated (including that one). The new 4 piece set bonuses are also retroactive as a result of the above change.<br />
<br />
2.3 PvP gear and armor penetration<br />
For all of you who were concerned about the armor penetration everywhere on items posted yesterday, you'll get more armor than that.<br />
There's more +armor on the pvp gear than there is +armor penetration on the melee pvp gear.<br />
<br />
The priest and warlock season 2 armor sets already have +910 bonus armor on them. As of season 3, the mage set will also have the +910 armor (all the armor pen on season 3 melee gear adds up to less than 910).<br />

The Arena rating calculator on the site has been updated and should perfectly work with the 2.2 version now.<br />

Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
(3) New daily quests are available in the Lower City for 5 man heroic and non-heroic dungeons (Once at a time, a bit like battlegroundw weekends, each day you will get quests for a different dungeons). The following non-heroic dungeons are concerned : Shattered Halls, Steamvault, Shadow Labyrinth, Black Morass, Botanica, Mechanar, and Arcatraz. All dungeons will get quests in Heroic mode. If you're getting the non-heroic and the heroic quest on the same day for the same dungeon, you can complete both by running it in heroic mode once. Non heroic quests will reward you with a Ethereum Prison Key (various reputation), gold, and reputation with the Consortium. Heroic quests will give you 2 Badges of Justice, gold, and reputation with the Consortium.<br />
(2) Mobs inside Sethekk Halls will now continue to award Lower City reputation all the way into Exalted. Previously they stopped giving reputation in non-heroic mode just before players hit revered.<br />
(2) The number of creatures that must be killed in the Karazhan Servants Quarters area before a miniboss spawns has been reduced.<br />

Heroic Badges drop from Zul'aman and Karazhan bosses.<br />
The amount of items available from the Heroic Badges vendor has been considerably increased. <br />
New 10-Man Raid - Zul'Aman!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zul'aman<br />
Zul'Aman will be a 10-person raid zone<br />
Zul'Aman will be on a quicker reset than 7 days (some might call this &quot;casual&quot;)<br />
Zul'Aman will be MORE difficult than Karazhan and drop better loot (some might call this hardcore)<br />
Zul'Aman will feature 6 bosses and it's our goal that you can kill them all in one night -- perhaps 2-3 hour clear times (some might call this casual)<br />
Zul'Aman will not have a key requirement. Nor will it have an attunement quest\ (some might call this casual)<br />
Zul'Aman will have a VERY challenging timed quest for those who choose to participate in it. This *will be* hardcore and will be very rewarding. Players do not have to engage in the timed run (very similar to the Baron run in Stratholme)<br />
We're tuning the first boss in Zul'Aman to require less raid coordination than some other raid bosses. He will still hit very hard so you'll need to be geared properly but it won't take 15 minutes to explain the fight. It will be a simple yet challenging fight. The other boss fights get more complex and challenging from there. If players want a basis of comparison, imagine the tuning of ZA started around Nightbane/Prince difficulty and ramped up from there.<br />
