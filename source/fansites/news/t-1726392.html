Patch 6.1 - Challenge Mode Leaderboards<br />
One of the undocumented changes (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_6.1.0_%28undocumented_changes%29) in Patch 6.1 was the removal of some shortcuts in dungeons (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1724709-Dungeon-Landscape-changes-WITH-ZERO-WARNING). This means that it would be very difficult to beat the current best times, as they likely utilized these shortcuts.<br />

Garrison Visitor - Profession Traders<br />
We've gone over the feedback regarding visiting profession traders. There's now a hotfix being worked on to remove the random element and have profession traders rotate out daily. The hotfix isn't ready yet, but it will be implemented as soon as possible. In short, no more fur traders visiting for multiple days in a row. <br />
<br />
The hotfix has been implemented on the live realms. Visiting profession traders should now be on a daily rotation. *Crosses talons the fur trader isn't first in the rotation.* (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/363630-were-already-getting-repeat-vendors/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16412002068?page=15#297))<br />

Flight Path Logic<br />
One specific flight path that I notice from doing the jukebox quest is trying to fly from the piece you get at Pinchwhistle to Everbloom to get the piece there. The flight path connects through a series of points that goes in a western arc through the middle of Talador then up through Gorgrond when it could easily have gone through a straighter path north.<br />
This one surprised me, and you don't have to point all the way to Everbloom. In recreating what you did, I went to Pinchwhistle and hovered over Beastwatch, and saw the issue.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the good example. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/363498-flight-paths-still-illogical/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16410891906?page=3#57))<br />

Will heirlooms change primary stats similar to how gear in Draenor changes stats with the new system in 6.1<br />
To add: it is something we’re keeping an eye on for the future as we see how players interact with the Heirloom system. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/567843368966889473))<br />
<br />
are Don Carlos's Famous Hat and the River Boat good candidates for the toy box?<br />
Not at this time, but thank you for the suggestions. What other things would you like to see as toys? (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/567843517487149056))<br />
<br />
- might've missed my last one - any chance of Illusion: Soulfrost and Illusion: Sunfire making it to the game ? Maybe in 6.1 ?<br />
Not in 6.1. We’re excited by the potential of the Illusion system &amp; always happy to hear which ones players might enjoy, though! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/567844245307936768))<br />

Reputation / Questing<br />
Frostwolf Orcs and Council of Exarchs rep achievs are per-character, but show up on opposite faction, is this fixed in 6.1?<br />
Not in 6.1, but we're aiming to have this fixed in 6.2. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/567840337906913281))<br />

Can you fix the female troll with a female orc voice in the dmf plz...She is the first troll juggler when you enter.<br />

Garrisons<br />
are the followers recruited via the Inn finite? eg will always picking Magic Debuff eventually exhaust that pool of followers?<br />
Finite, but there are a whole lot of them. It would take you over a year of recruiting to get all of the Magic Debuff followers. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/567755135640559618))<br />
<br />
Why is my level 94 DK not getting Highmaul follower missions even though it has enough 645 ilevel followers?<br />
Cache missions will join the rotation once you hit level 100. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/567777970825207808))<br />
Why cache missions but not all the other gear ones, though?<br />
Cache missions are based upon your progress in the various raid instances. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/567796140013314048))<br />

Indeed, either just acknowledge you are using the players as testers or deliver a product that has been tested extensively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the PTR were exactly the same as the Live realm you might have a point, but they even tell you that not everything on your character is copied over. That's how something 'obvious' on Live can get overlooked on the PTR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I imagine it will take them next to no effort (like a month) to create an Internal Test Server where they employ one-two thousand people to play the game 8 hours a day (mandatory) and report and help out resolving all the errors in the game, run a statistic like Warcraftlogs for that server to help out balancing issues. To prevent unfinished content coming out to the real Live servers that test server should be set 2 months ahead in time, so 6.1 would have been on the ITS for 2 months, all the bugged achievements, spells, quests and items would have been revealed and fixed for the real release for the PAYING customers.<br />

I just did a little counting... the game has been out for 106 days and they have had 43 hotfix patches... That is not normal.</div></div><hr />

While fixes are better than bugs, they still are a sign of bad workflow/production.</div></div><hr />

No, they are a sign of complete testing being impossible in the timeframe, size and scope of their software.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After thinking I would never get something good from a Blingotron 5000 package, other than the li'l bling I already had, I got something blue today and it wasn't a pet. Its was that stupid selfie bomb 'toy'. I should have recorded me deleting that stupid piece of shit.<br />
