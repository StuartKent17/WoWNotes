Why would it? We knew about Cataclysm last year, before the 5th anniversary, and it didn't come out. More than likely it will just be added during a Tuesday maintenance or a patch, regardless of whether we're playing Cataclysm then or not.</div></div><hr />

Nice to see they reverted that, I kinda didn't like spending 2 points just to make talents like Enlightened Judgements and Judgements of the Pure useful. Also, I'm in love with the new talent and not because it reduces our AW cooldown. I just freakin' love the name. Paragon of Virtue... Sounds badass.<br />

<br />
Everyone (well, a lot of people..) thinks they're the ones being singled out with every patch. It's just the way people and the community are. One class could be 500% more effective in tanks/heals/dps than everyone else, and in a Beta/PTR patch numbers get lowered to be more reasonable, and suddenly people say, &quot;Well that does it. I guess they hate my class I have to play something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
The goal shouldn't be to play whichever class Blizzard forgot to [attempt to] tune correctly. Seriously, they're balancing numbers here. Just wait.</div></div><hr />

Let me put it in prospective for you.<br />
<br />
You'll never read a post where a Priest, DK, Lock or Hunter says, 'Forget these nerfs to healing/tanking/dps I'd rather roll a Pally!' <br />
<br />
So yeah, this is why Pallies practice their QQ down to a Jedi art in the vien hope any at Blizz plays a pally enough to give a damn.<br />
<br />
But remeber I faced the truth, Blizz will never EVER let Pallies face roll any other class, accept it like I have.</div></div><hr />

Anyone know why there are 4 different colors of the tier armor?<br />
<br />
Probably a normal &amp; heroic set like T9&amp;10. Also the random loot off bosses that use the same models as tier gear.</div></div><hr />

KC buff was just restored version of the previous nerf, almost every main shot got nerfed in the 2nd beta build, arcane shot went from 19 to 4% (4.75 times, yes) RAP scaling in the last build, Bite buff from 7% to 8% when they nerfed it from 14% just yesterday together with a nerf to animal handler talent<br />
<br />
glad to see people reading patch notes every 2 days...<br />
<br />
from the first beta build this is a total nerf to the BM spec: 10% more RAP scaling to KC but a huge nerf to pet specials, arcane shot and animal handler...and they also removed Rhumba!</div></div><hr />

<br />
haha! im not against the helm i think its cool looking but it don synergize or fit to the rest of the armor and it needs to be more bulky around the chest.<br />
<br />
seems like its not final cuz its surely needs some improvement on the chest leggs and shoulder also to make it big enuff to follow up with the helmet, But then again it will also look like a deathknight or warrior.... it atleast needs something that is missing cuz it dont fit the helmet just look awkward.<br />
<br />
and the eyes and how un synergized the helm is it makes it look really dumb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. Achievement is in patch 4.0.1 so it doesn't mean Cata will be out by then, it means pre-Cata patch will be out. Pre-Cata patch is basically cata client but without server side world changes.</div></div><hr />

It is a beta/ptr build, they are always changing things, if you think something like &quot;Oh boo who my random spell only hits for base damage, and doesn't scale with stats!&quot; (see: Rip) is INTENDED and going to be that way on live, just stop reading beta/ptr updates, you're going to give yourself a stroke.

That's what I get from the new description aswell. If it really works like this now, it's more of a &quot;fire when max dots are up and forget&quot; button. Takes a little of the fiddling with reapplying new dots out of the game, which makes the dps loss when doing it wrong smaller. Debatable if this change is good. I personally prefer the &quot;do it right and be awesome, do it less right and be ok&quot; approach, to be honest.</div></div><hr />

AV, once again &quot;magic portals&quot; there's no location in the zone that resembles the interior of AV that is large enough to encompass it, so there would need to be a redesign of the physical world to place an in the world AV. WSG could actually be placed between the horde and alliance encampments at the portals, however there isn't much telling what changes that part of the world will be undergoing as neighboring regions are being pretty worked over by the elements/dragons/old gods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard, what the hell are you doing? Ret has enough troubles right now in PvE, I shutter to think what entails for your PvP ideas.<br />
<br />
From what i understand is that they're changing the difference of only 2 out of 3 holy power stacking of Templar's Verdict. I'm unsure why, maybe in a better tier of gear you could do decent or better dps with a down ranked TV (2 holy power). So they've changed the damage to be lower, so you are more interested in getting the 3rd stack.<br />
<br />
I don't see any real problem to this change, unless i've miss understood. :S<br />
<br />

<br />
My impressions of the Marked for Death change, it synergises badly. It is useless for PVE except for saving a GCD every 5 minutes (and you refresh it on heavy movement fights anyway), and in PVP, it removes the prime pvp benefits of Hunters Mark, so just becomes unremovable damage.<br />
<br />
Talents which invoke a sacrifice for a benefit seem kind of odd for me, especially when they're already easy to spec into as it is due to plenty of floater points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the ret note, those aren't really nerfs imo, using TV at 2 stacks should be a penalty...it currently hits almost 10k with 2 stacks as it is.<br />
<br />
The CS mana increase was justified as with the glyph it's extremely cheap...we essentially are in a much better shape mana wise even with this nerf versus live.<br />
<br />
Don't forget the ret buffs they added for PTR will be in this build too i'm sure. I look forward to testing the new changes.</div></div><hr />

Paladin bitching,<br />
Death Knight bitching,<br />
Warlock bitching,<br />
and Hunter bitching.<br />
<br />
Any other classes think that Blizzard is singling them out and picking on them? I honestly think that by now everyone should know that numbers pass has barely started, so this premature QQ has to be trolling.<br />
<br />
Well people see all these new and exciting changes and like them but they get nerfed because blizzard overdid the talent/spell. They promise you a porsche but in the end you get a renault. But the funny thing is, everybody gets a renault... Same goes for retri (my 1 and only char), it feels like they promised us a renault already instead of a porsche and seeing all those great players in beta (*ahum*) duelling as retri it makes me worried. But ive got faith now that almost all classes get a nerfbat and think the outcome at 85 isnt gonna be so bad as it looks :)</div></div><hr />

in pve i can just put hunters mark on and pretty much be done. While with this talent i not only have this 1 shot weaker since there is no mark on target yet but also it has 15 sec duration (other thing is if it stacks with mark, tough doubtfull). On the pvp side why would i want that? i rather want hunters mark itself as its free and dispelling is going to cost much more mana in cata. Besides its covering my eventual freezing trap and makes life of certain classes hell. <br />
<br />
Sooooo whats the f*cking point of this talent ?:S<br />
<br />
and yeah, wrecking crew change definately makes it usefull... not<br />
Even with 40% crit its impossible to keep wrecking crew up. Let alone with ~15% which you will ahve at lvl 85.<br />
I still ahve no idea what was the point of nerfing this talent... nor i understand blizz logic since recently they stated thay dont like talents proccing from crits...</div></div><hr />

Just to nitpick a bit, WoWtal is till broken, Improved Fire blast still shows 4000% crit chance instead of 8% and pyromaniac is only 2% instead of 10%. It wouldn't mention this if it haven't been broken for 4 beta builds now!</div></div><hr />

<br />
My impressions of the Marked for Death change, it synergises badly. It is useless for PVE except for saving a GCD every 5 minutes (and you refresh it on heavy movement fights anyway), and in PVP, it removes the prime pvp benefits of Hunters Mark, so just becomes unremovable damage.<br />
<br />
Talents which invoke a sacrifice for a benefit seem kind of odd for me, especially when they're already easy to spec into as it is due to plenty of floater points.<br />
<br />
The thing is: Gainst anyone who isn't a rogue or ferl, this is an insanely good thing:) No longer can they dispell yoyur + dmg buff, and you don't ven have to use an extra key press. You will still use the old Mark against stealthers:P</div></div><hr />

Well after trying out my prot pally on the ptr yesterday they've succeeded in making me not want to play him. Holy Power is one of the most counter-intuitive tanking mechanics I've ever tried. Forcing myself to NOT hit a button to tank (ShoR) until 3 stacks of Holy power just feels wrong to me.<br />
Sure glad I have an eighty warrior, he on the other hand was very fun.</div></div><hr />

It's freakin' TERRIBLE. Man the art team has must have really ran out of talent and/or ideas so far, as the Rogue and Druid sets sucked, but this lock set is LAUGHABLE at best. It looks like they hit their talent cap for sure now. I saw this coming when the Rogue set, which usually they look good each time at least, looked terrible. Now we have another class which usually has a great armor set which looks amateurish in design too? This is not a good sign. Mix this in with the pedestrian weapon models we had a while back and this game is not looking too bright.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's real art team must be on their new-mmo by now. Or, they're out of ideas. Or, they just don't care anymore. Yet they made sure to have guild chat working as pay-to-use. Get your act together Blizzard, you're making yourself look like a bunch of goofs out for money anymore.<br />

I wish I can do this &quot;lowered expectations&quot; stuff. I also love how whenever Blizzard lowers their standards, you'll have the obsessive Blizzard fans lower their own at the same time giving Blizzard a free pass. But this is just giving Blizzard a pat on the back for not putting their best talent on the game. The weapons and armor shown to date is insulting. They look worse than the stuff you see in Free-To-Play MMOs. It's a joke, and when you compare the stuff we're seeing now to what we've had for years, it's blatantly obvious that Blizzard has either: Moved their top talent to the new MMO. Put their less talented people on this. Lowered their standards and take anything their artist draw up and put on the fridge. Or they're just out of ideas. I DON'T want dragon wings making up all of my armor and weapons, it's stupid. Screw this theme. It looks so elementary.</div></div><hr />

That is quite common. The new installs often don't replace the cache files. Remove the cache folder in the main directory and the cache folder in the data folder. Hopefully that will do the trick.</div></div><hr />

Like they intend paladin tanks to invest few points in non-protection trees.<br />
<br />
Crusade and arbiter of the light are pretty clear investments, but improved judgments would definitely be a strange talent to take as a tank. Eye for an eye is sort of curious, would it include something like a breath weapon? Or an aura from a boss? Or will bosses in Cataclysm have directed magic attacks? Also, why would retribution have guardian's favour? Is the placement for PVp<br />
<br />
Haste is a strange statistic for tanks, I could see how it would be sort of useful for threat, but most tank weapons swing quickly anyway, and reckoning would do the same thing more efficiently. But I might be thinking with a Wrath paradigm. Protector of the innocent might work, help your healers save some mana during flight phases or the like but healing while you tank disables all your defenses and would likely cost more than it would save.</div></div><hr />

They promise you a porsche but in the end you get a renault. But the funny thing is, everybody gets a renault... Same goes for retri (my 1 and only char), it feels like they promised us a renault already instead of a porsche and seeing all those great players in beta (*ahum*) duelling as retri it makes me worried. But ive got faith now that almost all classes get a nerfbat and think the outcome at 85 isnt gonna be so bad as it looks :)<br />

Woo, someone -not- whining, :)</div></div><hr />

This totally destroys the cool synergy I saw developing between the ToL instant cast Regrowths and Regrowth procing Efflorescence. Now... Efflorescence procs are paced waiting on the Swiftmend cooldown. WEAK!<br />
<br />
Have you even played resto druid on beta? You don't cast Regrowths more than you do Swiftmends (and if you do, I see no reason why). Attaching Efflorescence to Swiftmend is better in all aspects. It gives on demand AoE heal, as well as some awesome tank healing tool, where you pretty much use Swiftmend a lot because its cheap and heals for good amount. The synergy that you speak was never developing. Spamming regrowths while in tree is just mana drain and if you need that much aoe healing, than you should use Tranquility which is very cheap for the amount it heals.<br />
Efflorescence has been buffed to the point I even fear a nerf is coming.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure GC plays a mage, so don't count on them getting any nerfs.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention the fact that if you read the talent it is 10/80/120% of swiftmend's healing! 120% of ~5500 is almost 1000 per second over 7 seconds! That is a 300% buff as far as I'm concerned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I love how some talent names just don't add up. Like Wrecking Crew...you're buffing yourself, alone, solo...in no way are you part of a &quot;crew&quot;. I think as long as they're re-evaluating this talent they should at least change its unfitting name.</div></div><hr />

Even with them it can still take a long time to get to certain zones in Azeroth. For Alliance basically anything in Kalimdor sucks to travel to.<br />
<br />
Maybe it won't be so bad with flying mounts, but still, that just seems like a pointless / anal retentive type of decision.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ringthane</div><div class="date">2010-09-27, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really. Achievement is in patch 4.0.1 so it doesn't mean Cata will be out by then, it means pre-Cata patch will be out. Pre-Cata patch is basically cata client but without server side world changes.<br />
<br />
So the pre-Cata patch is actually Cataclysm? Then why do we need to buy the expansion? <br />
<br />
Answer: because it's NOT Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
It will contain the redesigned zones. It will contain other changes. Will it contain Worgen and Goblins? No. Will it contain Hyjal, Deepholm, Grim Batol, Twilight Highlands, or Uldum? No (they may be in the files, but you won't be able to play them). So it's really not Cataclysm, is it? <br />
<br />
Put it another way: Dustwallow Marsh was redesigned for 2.4 (or 2.3, I can't remember which, but sometime in BC). It wasn't because of Wrath coming out, it was just that they redesigned the zone. The Ruby Sanctum was added a patch or so ago. Not for the expansion - just for something to do. The Argent Tournament was added in an earlier Wrath patch - not for an expansion, for a raid. Same thing here. We couldn't be Draenei or blood elves till BC, we couldn't be DKs until Wrath, and until Cata is switched on, we won't be playing Cataclysm either. We'll just be playing a patched Wrath.<br />
<br />
And now that it looks like Cata may not be out till December, I look even more right. Of course, that's not official, but judging from what I've been hearing about how unstable the beta still is, this expansion's nowhere near ready.</div></div><hr />
