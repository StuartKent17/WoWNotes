Patch 6.1 Hotfixes<br />
Lumbering Ancients Spawn Rate<br />
Lumbering Ancients have always been rare and there was no change to the spawn rate. Having said that, there's a hotfix underway to make Lumbering Ancients multi-tap to help with this potential bottleneck.<br />
<br />
The hotfix to make Lumbering Ancient should now be live. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/363246-lumbering-ancients-spawns-decreased/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16411181717?page=1#14))<br />
<br />
Heirloom Vendor Crowding<br />
The hotfix to add collision around the Heirloom NPCs should now be live. Additionally, a dismount aura has been applied to Estelle Gendry (Horde Heirloom Vendor) via hotfix. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/363192-soquestion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16411181707?page=4#62))<br />

Tiger Strikes Hotfix<br />
We recently found a significant bug with Tiger Strikes for all Monks, and wanted to explain the incoming fixes that will resolve it.<br />
<br />
The bug itself was twofold. First off, Tiger Strikes was incorrectly able to trigger from unsuccessful autoattacks (such as those that miss, or have been dodged or parried). However, it was NOT able to trigger from Multistrikes. We’ll be fixing Tiger Strikes to its intended behavior: it will no longer activate on unsuccessful autoattacks, but will be able to activate from successful Multistrikes.<br />
<br />
Fixing those bugs will result in an overall damage gain for all Monks, so we’ll be making a couple other adjustments:<br />
<br />
For Brewmasters, we’re going to reduce the damage done by Keg Smash by 20%. We felt that Brewmaster DPS was too strong already, and the Tiger Strikes fix only pushes them further.<br />
Windwalkers and Mistweavers were a little weak, which is why we’re increasing Rising Sun Kick’s damage amplification debuff from 10% to 20% in 6.1. The Tiger Strikes fix will be a small damage increase on top of that, but we’re going to keep an eye on where Windwalkers and Mistweavers end up as a result of it before making any further adjustments if necessary.<br />
<br />
<br />
These changes were not able to make it into the final 6.1 build, but will be hotfixed in shortly after 6.1 goes live.<br />
<br />
Can we get an eta on the zen sphere detonate fix?<br />
That's fixed in patch 6.1.<br />
<br />
We did also find that Tiger Strikes was incorrectly using the lower dual-wield proc chance when Mistweavers were equipping one-handed items in conjunction with off-hand items. We’ll be fixing that to give the full 10% chance while in Crane Stance when these hotfixes go live.<br />
<br />
We’ve also discovered that the tooltip for Tiger Strikes is incorrectly stating that the chance for it to activate is 6.25% while dual-wielding. The actual chance is 5% (and has been since Warlords of Draenor released). The tooltip will be updated in a future patch.<br />
<br />
If you don't mind me asking, is there anything you're going to do to address the Roll Perk bug? It increases the speed you roll by 25%, but also unintentionally reduces the distance traveled by 25% as well.<br />
That should also be fixed in this round of hotfixes. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/363117-upcoming-tiger-strikes-hotfix/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16410181488?page=3#55))<br />

Combat Rogue's PvP 4-piece Set Bonus<br />
The hotfix for Combat Rogue's PvP 4-piece set bonus was implemented and will now provide the Cold Blood effect after using Vanish. Note that the tooltip will incorrectly display text for the old set bonus. This will be fixed in a future client-side patch.<br />
<br />
Cold Blood - Combat Rogue PvP 4-piece set bonus<br />
When you use Vanish, you gain 5 Combo Points and the critical strike chance of your next Sinister Strike, Eviscerate, Revealing Strike, or Ambush is increased by 100%.<br />

Follower Work Order Bonus<br />
Is your Follower assigned to the building for each work order as it's completed? We closed a loophole that would allow you to assign a Follower to a building right before collecting the work orders, and gain all the bonus even though they weren't assigned to the building the whole time. The intended functionality (and the one active in 6.1) is that the Follower needs to be assigned to the building as each work order completion ticks for their bonus to be applied. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/363240-follower-bonus-lowered/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16411361962?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
Blackrock Foundry Missions<br />
This is stupid, if you really need normal kills to get your mythic box.<br />
You do not need to go back to a lower difficulty to be eligible for higher difficulty Raid Missions for followers.<br />
<br />
Example: You don't need any Normal difficulty raid kills for your followers to qualify for Mythic Raid Missions.<br />
<br />
Don't be stupid. We're told the way the system is supposed to work, and it's not working as advertised.<br />
Source? The system is working correctly.<br />
<br />
All information I've read up until today has been that you clear LFR enough you get normal. You clear normal enough you get heroic. You clear heroic enough you get mythic. You clear mythic enough you get mythic and some coin.<br />
Without the source of what led the quoted poster to believe the system was working incorrectly I'm unable to investigate if the info they got was correct or not.<br />
<br />
For the sake of further clarification, Highmaul progression is not required to unlock Blackrock Foundry Raid Missions. Progressing in Highmaul provides an alternate way to unlock Blackrock Foundry Raid Missions, but it's not required.<br />
<br />
people with 30 BRF heroic kills, including blackhand, ARE NOT GETTING THE MYTHIC CACHE. how many heroic kills do we need. can some of these kills be in the same lockout.<br />
<br />
I've not seen a SINGLE report of ANYONE getting the mythic cache who also didn't have 8 highmaul mythic kills.<br />
Were the kills loot eligible? Killing the same boss multiple times in the same week does not count as a loot eligible kill.

<br />
Fur Trader: No other Traders Available Today?<br />
Intended?<br />
Yes, and it's region-wide.<br />
<br />
Of the new Garrison visitors who is at your Garrison is random, and what they offer is randomly selected each day, but that same selection applies to that NPC regardless of whose Garrison they're at for the day. So for example, you have the raid quest NPC, and it's for Brackenspore, and anyone else who has the raid NPC for the day also has that same quest. Tomorrow the raid NPC will have a new random quest, and anyone who has the raid NPC will all have the same quest.<br />
<br />
The idea is that you're visiting your friends and guildies Garrisons to get access to each of the 5 types of NPC's each day, but that you're not needing to visit a hundred Garrisons to complete all of their potential quests.

Patch Note Changes<br />
&quot;A new vendor has been added allowing players to use Garrison Resource to purchase items to upgrade Followers&quot;<br />
<br />
They don't mean the guy that starts invasions, right?<br />
He sells nothing that is a guaranteed upgrade for your follower whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm missing something.<br />
The note was updated to the following: <br />
<br />
&quot;There’s a new vendor coming to your Garrison who allows you to spend Garrison Resources on Follower Trait Retraining Guides or Follower Ability Retraining Manuals.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, no. It wasn't a lie. Patch notes are an ongoing effort and we update them as quickly as possible when changes come in. This one was updated this morning to reflect the correct functionality.<br />
<br />
Sorry for any confusion the note may have caused.<br />
<br />
See, Blizzard never lies. They just tell you something then change the information when needed.<br />
A lie would be with intent to deceive. There was no intent to deceive. I understand the frustration. As with any development cycle, things can change relatively fast and miscommunications can happen. We do our best to minimize those and when they do occur, we try to correct them right away. I also didn't try to deny that it had been different before. Yes, it was worded differently. Yes, the note had been incorrect. Yes, it's been since corrected. We'll keep working to make sure these errors don't happen in the future, but there's no guarantee they'll never happen again.<br />
<br />
Proper etiquette when editing documents is to explain any revisions. Simply putting correction: or update: would have made all this a non-issue. Simply changing it smacks of deception and trying to fly under the radar. That's the problem I have, not that there was a mistake. Mistakes happen. Trying to hide them is another whole issue.<br />
We document changes in the PTR notes this way as changes occur. These changes were made to the live notes which serve as a &quot;new&quot; document. It's a strange sort of beast in that, if we change things to show edits, it implies those edits came after publication vs. during which could confuse people who haven't been following along with the PTR notes. They just want to know how things work, not how they were documented before it went live. (If that makes sense.) There's no &quot;hiding&quot; anything, it's just a side effect of this sort of documentation and the anomalies that go with them.

In 6.0 you changed the cast animation of 'denounce' (pala) from directed to omni (heal).Intended?Looks strange as a dmg spell<br />
In 6.0 we performed an audit of which animations each spell used. Some changed which can be jarring, but they were intended. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/565692069315084289))<br />
So the &quot;buff&quot; animation on Deep Freeze &amp; Counterspell is intended? Looks awful..<br />
What you're referring to as the &quot;buff&quot; animation is not for buffs, but for indirect spells, which includes buffs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/565697660909543424))<br />
Deep and CS seem pretty direct to me. /confused<br />
Direct typically means something is coming out of your hands, like a Frostbolt. Comet Storm is very indirect. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/565803769900724225))<br />

We’ll look into it, thanks for the report! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/565670262134546433))<br />

Character / Items<br />
Will [Automated Critter Defense Cannon] become a Toy in 6.1?<br />
Consumables don’t go in the toybox, but we can consider creating a non-consumable version in the future. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/565668236759691264))<br />
<br />
Could we get the ability to downgrade token drops from older raids? Would be nice to have access to MoP LFR gear for transmog.<br />
No, but you can queue into old LFR instances from Auridormi/Lorewalkers to get that gear. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/565668794748915713))<br />
<br />
Is the heirloom mount speed disabled in Battlegrounds without training? It would surely hurt the 19-10 twinks.<br />
Yes, it is disabled in that bracket. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/565687970548957184))<br />

Stats<br />
Are you planning to change the way versatility works atm? peeps say you dislike it and want to make it more viable.<br />
(1) Versatility is working out well. It's a consistently good (albeit not the best) stat for everyone, which we're happy with. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/565976047921811456))<br />
(2) Based on what we've seen in the progression race, many guilds are sacrificing a tiny bit of DPS for damage reduction. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/565976493444956160))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Would love to hear how people are making use of skirmishes. Mostly solo queue? 2s only? 3s only? Both? Low level? Max level? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/566106729792802816))<br />
<br />
I pick up things in ashran I don't want because not picking them up puts them in my mailbox without being able to delete mail.<br />
Thanks! We know this has been an issue for many and we’ve taken some steps to improve it in 6.1. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/565686814594580481))<br />
<br />
Specifically Cyclone being dispellable, because its basically uncounterable, or Cyclone sharing a DR with mage CC.<br />
That DR change would just mean the complaints would shift from Mage Druid synergy to Lock Druid synergy. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/566389497940549632))<br />

We're not going to put it on two DR categories. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/566390030805893120))<br />

From what I gathered it seems most of their effort is going to the new expansion which should already be quite far ahead, tho that's all just hear say :rolleyes:<br />

It's a strange sort of beast in that, if we change things to show edits, it implies those edits came after publication vs. during which could confuse people who haven't been following along with the PTR notes.<br />
<br />
This sort of bullshit really makes me mad. For starters, they're flat-out admitting they don't expect their customers to be able to contextualise statements made in patch notes. Of course, in a small vocal minority this is the case, but there is ALWAYS an abundance of people willing to not just correct them, but call them retards for having failed to follow each iteration of patch notes upon release.<br />
<br />
Secondly, it's practically constructed solely of weasel words. We don't care if you said the wrong thing, which is kind of the point that the tweeter was trying to make. Just don't try to twist things around and say you were never wrong, we just didn't understand or you failed to explain clearly what you actually meant. Just admit you were wrong. Most of us won't crucify you for it, but we will for not only trying to deceive us, but for insulting our intelligence in the process.</div></div><hr />

It seems the patch notes are wrong. I did not get any mailed stone on my 3 100's with level 3 garrison; however, there was a quest giver over by the pet shack that had me go get a Mysterious Stone at the mine. When I turned that in I got the pet stone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing I don't understand when it comes to complaints like this is; what content did they produce before that they didn't this time around? Every expansion has been exactly the same. The only difference I see is this go around the rep grinds don't yield gear. They still exist if you want pets, followers, or mounts. This expansion is no better or worse than the last 3. It's the same formula, the shtick this go around is the garrison. I don't like how they have homogenized professions, but the professions have never been all that great in this game. The followers and missions are OK. Its a little side game that doesn't take a lot of time. There won't be much more content in the future outside of new raids, maybe a couple of catch-up dungeons. Maybe they reintroduce scenarios. (Which I was confused about them taking out. Nobody seemed to hate them, maybe people just weren't doing them?)<br />
<br />
My only complaint is that it seems like as a 10 man raid, you're supposed to progress through normal, then progress through heroic. I personally don't play enough to progress through 2 tiers of raiding. It feels like a lot more work, while feeling less rewarding. I was much happier being able to progress through heroic(normal) and then dipping my feet into mythic(heroic) by killing 3-4 bosses while ignoring normal(flex).</div></div><hr />

Actually, I find myself even more dependent on AskMrRobot because of WoD because of the new secondary stats. At least in WotLK, Cata, and MoP, I understand my class's and specialization's stat priority and how to juggle them with the gear I had or newly acquired. Now there's so much Diablo 3 shite in my WoW experience that I've given up managing my gear on my own.<br />
<br />
I view the purpose of AMR's combat log feature as not necessarily to be 'the best that ever was.' It's to present a combat log parser designed for the players who have never tried such a thing - or tried but were too intimidated by the amount of information. AMR saw a lack and decided to attempt to fill it. Supply and demand at its most basic.<br />
<br />
The people who run AskMrRobot are genuinely nice folk, too, who participate in the WoW community outside of the game.<br />
<br />
Sorry-not-sorry for being one of the &quot;tards.&quot;</div></div><hr />

AMR has good people and a good product. No one is forced to fork over money, and the basic stuff that most will only want to use is free. I have found their Combat Log and Combat Infographic also are much simpler to get use out of than the very steep learning curve that is WoL.<br />

And by the way, it's called adapting. You know, like in the marketplace.</div></div><hr />

I called it last month, they're going to strip Ashran of all of it's features, until it's another AV. Holinka can't design his way out of his cubicle with a map and a GPS unit, let alone fix his pile of pvp poop.<br />

I'm also glad a bunch of you like the infographics, we had a lot of fun making them. Here's some more information on the scores (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2015/02/combat-logs-scores/) for people who are new to them. And we also have a 5 minute video the reviews the data-view (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8zR62Ktoc) as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
And since our premium offering came up in discussion, here's a bit of info for everyone! I'm really not trying to promote it, I just want to make sure a few things are clear and no one is misinformed. (Those of you who see me on the forums a lot know that I almost never promote premium features here).<br />
<br />
- The infographics are free, I want to make sure that's well-known. They will stay free too! <br />
- Best in Bags (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2013/01/best-in-bags/), Bonus Roll Optimizer (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2013/03/how-to-spend-your-mogu-runes-of-fate/), Team Optimizer (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2015/02/team-optimizer/) (and more) are premium (for $12 a year)<br />
- Everyone gets a 1 week free trial, where you NEVER enter your credit card. If you don't like the features enough to upgrade, that's on us! And if anyone's free trial ran out and you want to try stuff again, just PM me your AMR username, happy to reset the trial.</div></div><hr />

In other words we have no fucking clue how to stop it. Also they need to fix the 125 stat food, that shit is fucking expensive. Should give 5 not 1. I also love sitting on my ass waiting all week for a fucking random npc that can give me the recipe to upgrade my darkmoon trinket. THAT IS SO MUCH FUN!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been using the infographics since they came out, they're a fantastic way to set bars and resolve problem areas with guildies. If you've never used them I suggest you try it before you vomit forth anymore garbage.<br />
<br />
Was unaware a premium service even existed, that's how unessential and down low it is. It's there if people want it, and the free tools are there for people who want those.</div></div><hr />
