Female Pandaren Face Options<br />
Are the female Pandaren done? I hope not. Scars or choice of base hair color would be welcomed. Please let us know something <br />
The request for more facial options has been provided to the team, but as far as I'm aware, there are no plans to add.<br />
<br />
So far the only options are if you choose red skin you get red hair, black skin black hair ect. and you cant choose streakless.<br />
There should be an option for &quot;solid&quot; color hair already. (It had been slated to be corrected in character creation.)<br />

Beta Class Balance Analysis<br />
Is it still intended for block to have diminishing returns? I'm looking at some data this evening, and as far as I can tell we're getting exactly 1% block for every 1% mastery all the way up to around 38% block (which is as high as my data set goes). If there were any meaningful DR on block (i.e., a cap lower than 1000 or so), I should have seen some nonlinearity by that point. But it's perfectly linear.<br />
<br />
The data set is gathered from the character sheet, so it's possible (though unlikely, in my mind) that the character sheet block percentage just isn't updating properly. <br />
Nope, Block chance does not DR.<br />
<br />
I haven't tested this myself, but I had read somewhere that the new weapon chain (Living Steel Weapon Chain) is designed to also be applied to ranged weapons. The spell description says &quot;Requires One-Handed Axes, Two-Handed Axes, Bows, Guns, One-Handed Maces, Two-Handed Maces, Polearms, One-Handed Swords, Two-Handed Swords, Staves, Fist Weapons, Daggers, Crossbows&quot;<br />
That is the intent, yes.<br />
<br />
Do we still need to wait another build before testing pet scaling, or can we get started once we drag ourselves away from pet battles?<br />
Yes, please go nuts. Warlock pet energy regen is something we are still futzing with so that may still be a little squirrely.<br />
<br />

So the question is, was blood tap meant to have a gcd and what was the thought process in adding one to the ability if it was meant to be added?<br />
We didn't want DKs to feel the need to macro it into every ability, which is how it was trending. DKs have a 1 sec GCD now and free globals so we don't think it's too much of a hardship.<br />
<br />
I just tested the new Army of the Dead with pet scaling fixes. At level 90 in full 483 PvP gear it dealt 297k damage. AoTD lasts 40s, so that's 7.43k DPS. It does not seem to be scaling any better than before.<br />
Just for comparison, how does an Army of the Dead compare to, say, a Scourge Strike, a Festering Strike, and 2 auto attacks? I don’t have numbers in front of me on that, but it seems like 297k would significantly outweigh that, which is what you’re giving up to Army (well, plus 6sec of disease time, to be fair).<br />

How are the devs feeling about Fae Empowerment?<br />
We’d definitely still like more feedback on Fae Empowerment. I don’t want to taint feedback too much with what we think about it, but I think it’s safe to say that it’s gotten a bit on the complex site, now that it provides the DPS boost we’re looking for. How it breaks up the rotation, and how it feels to use Faerie Fire rotationally, how that contributes to the feeling of repetitiveness, etc, are all things we’d love more feedback on.<br />

Is this intentional or has aimed shot just not been tweaked yet to use a more straightforward formula?<br />
We can give it a more sane formula. The damage it does is about in the right place.<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin))<br />
Hey GC, sorry to ask/bother you again -- but is Divine Purpose supposed to have synergy with Hammer of Wrath, that the tooltips are not telling us? Also asking because it also affects how valuable the talent is with this extra synergy -- since it affects gameplay in an execute phase.<br />
Just a bug left over from the Cataclysm version. Divine Purpose should proc from Word of Glory, Templar's Verdict, Inquisition, Eternal Flame, Shield of the Righteous, Light of Dawn and Divine Storm.<br />
<br />
As it stands now there are no useful glyphs for Holy PvE since Ascetic was removed, Blessed Life nerfed and, while Battle Healer was buffed, it's still weak.<br />
Every Holy paladin was taking those glyphs, which removed the choice about which glyph to use. Battle Healer is tricky to balance for Holy, because it wouldn't take much for every paladin to feel forced into melee, which isn't the intent. It should be an option.<br />
<br />
Is Sacred Shield limited to one target still? The talent would be tremendously better if it had a small target cap. Also just to confirm EF does not longer have a target cap? It's still pretty limited without one but just wanting to confirm.<br />
Sacred Shield is limit one. We could consider removing the target cap, but I suspect since it is free now you might see paladins trying to blanket a group and ignore their other spells, which would have gameplay and balance ramifications.<br />
<br />
Eternal Flame does not have a target limit. It is in nearly every way a Word of Glory that also has a hot component. One exception is that Eternal Flame does not work with Harsh Words.<br />
<br />
Is it intended for Eternal Flame not to consume Bastion of Glory because its not consuming it (while WoG still is)?<br />
Unintended. Fixed for next build.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman))<br />
I am also wondering if we will see any Compensation for this nerf to our mana and our throughput as from what I seen we are not the top of the pile in healing or mana for beta. And like you pointed out it cuts out about 8% of our total healing and a big chunk of mana<br />
As I said before, Resurgence and Water Shield are where we would add back Resto shaman regen if needed. It felt a little low last week so we might do that. Determining whether healer mana is sufficient is a slow process for us because it takes lots of testing (theoretical and in game) under a variety of situations. It's impractical to &quot;target dummy&quot; healing.<br />
<br />
1. Lightning Shield does not appear to be able to proc Echo of the Elements. Intended?<br />
Intended.<br />
<br />
2. With Unleashed Fury, it appears that synchronized weapon swings might be suffering from a hidden cooldown on Static Shock.<br />
Another good catch. Fixed for next build.<br />
<br />
Can you tell us a bit about the changes to Stormlash Totem? Pre-patch i was getting 1mil dmg single target from two Stormlashes on a 10min test, Post-patch I got 220k on the same test. <br />
The build you just got includes our latest pass at tuning Stormlash Totem. It is not intended to be on the same scale as Bloodlust in value to a raid. Some specs will get more benefit from it than others, but everyone should get at least something out of it. In particular, Stormlash will favor class abilities and passives that increase all damage, or that increase nature damage. But, in the grand scheme of things, Stormlash shouldn’t be a major impact on class/spec balance, even if one spec gets double the damage from it another spec does, since its total damage contribution isn’t a significant percent of a player’s total damage.<br />
<br />
Fundamentally, there’s a base Stormlash damage, which is currently (but may be too strong) 30% of SP or 20% of AP. Then, various attacks deal a percentage of that base damage. Auto attacks deal 40% of base for main-hands, and 20% for off-hands, and are normalized to a 2.6 weapon speed. Spells and abilities generally deal 100%, and are normalized to a 1.5 sec cast time. It generally only procs from direct non-periodic damage, but there are exceptions for Mind Flay, Malefic Grasp, and in the next build Drain Soul. Finally, we do customize these formulae for certain spells which we want to tune to be stronger or weaker, to make up for significant deficiencies or proficiencies.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock))<br />
I thought it would have been fixed in this build, but Drain Soul is doing too much damage out of Execute. <br />
There’s a bug in the current build you have, where Drain Soul is doing significantly more damage than it should (triple, I believe), all the time. That should be fixed for the next build.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior))<br />
I did some extensive mathematics on warrior tanking, more precisely, Shield Block vs. Shield Barrier. <br />
Short Version: There is currently nearly no reason for any warrior to use Shield Block. The amount of physical damage done by a boss melee swing to be high enough that the 30%/60% block outshines the absorb puts it out of reach of the vast majority of the playerbase. Obviously, this is even more true with non-blockable or magic damage, but even with the kind of attacks that can be blocked, Shield Barrier is just plain better for everything other than non-nerfed 25H bosses who use debuffs on the tank.<br />
Thanks for the great analysis.<br />
<br />
The scaling we chose for Shield Barrier was to keep it competitive with Shield Block with very high end gear (beyond even the gear available in the first tier). The problem is this is one of those situations where linear AP scaling can't really fit the curve nicely. Shield Barrier (and by extension Frenzied Regen) will either be too good at low gear levels or too weak at high gear levels. We could use a more complex curve, such as squaring attack power as long as that doesn't prove confusing. For sake of argument, imagine that Shield Barrier (and Frenzied Regen) is roughly half as strong as it is on beta when you're in greens, but scales up in strength about 50% faster than it currently does.<br />
<br />
Hey GC, I'm fairly positive there's some crunching or something weird going on with Bloodbath for both Arms and Fury (and likely Prot as well). I noticed its damage seemed a bit low when I was testing it, but never really got around to seeing if it was truly bugged or something until today.<br />
We’re not able to reproduce any discrepancy. Maybe you’re seeing some because you’re using Bloodbath in the middle of doing your rotation, making it difficult to clearly identify which attacks were made with Bloodbath active and which weren’t (combat log timestamps aren’t necessarily 100% reliable for this). Can you reproduce this if you hit Bloodbath, wait a second, then start attacking, and then stop using any specials at least a second before Bloodbath ends? This shouldn’t be an issue in practice, but the exact timing of the buff going up and fading make analysis of it difficult. It’s possible that there’s a bug with some damage being munched, and we want to solve that if so.<br />
<br />
Hey GC, did you all do something intentional to rage generation? It was 5 rage per second for MH strikes and 2.5 rage for OH strikes (full report here: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5978458015?page=7#129). Now it seems to have been reduced to 2.5 rage per second for MH strikes and 1.25 rage per second for OH strikes. Is this intentional or a bug of some kind?<br />
We lowered it. Fury had an abundance of Rage for sure. For Arms, we need to balance the number of free attacks (CS, MS and OP) vs. the spenders (HS and Slam). There is some incentive to sit on Heroic Strikes to build up the stack rather than use them whenever possible, but if you sit on them too long, then you will overflow with Rage. We are trying to engineer a decision about when to Heroic Strike and when to Slam instead, but that decision is dependent on not having too much Rage (especially before everyone is geared in epics in the very first tier). <br />
<br />
I acknowledge that this is different feedback than we have received from some players, so there may be something else going on. The feedback is never clear cut because we know that there are warriors out there who never want to feel rage limited and want to essentially be a cooldown-driven class and it's hard to separate that feedback from the players who understand the design intent.<br />
<br />
The intended design is that we never fill all our GCDs, except maybe while Avatar and/or Bloodlust are up. So we'll never get close to where we were. Slam is the rage dump, which only works if you have the ability to use Slam when you need to dump rage. This means you need empty GCDs. Always. At every gear level.<br />
I'd say that when you use cooldowns (even things like Battle Shout and Storm Bolt), it's fine to use every GCD, but that means there are times when you don't fill every GCD either.<br />
<br />
We also don't have a problem with warriors eventually filling every GCD when they have the maximum amounts of haste and crit possible in the final tier of gear. But that needs to be an eventual destination, not where everyone starts in quest blues.<br />
<br />
We don't want Arms to stand around waiting for 2-3 Mortal Strikes before being able to afford a Slam, even in quest blues. (We also don't think that's happening.) Once you have enough Rage to Slam regularly, then the only thing to spend Rage on is Heroic Strikes. Once you're able to hit Heroic Strike almost on cooldown, then there is no little room for warriors to scale with haste and crit (you'll get the extra damage of course, which is always nice, but you won't have the rage). We don't want to reach that point anytime soon.<br />
<br />

Challenge Mode Valor Point Rewards<br />
But I'd like to see them reward more VP for a clear than heroic mode, such that for a skilled group they'll always be the most efficient way to grind valor.<br />
Challenge modes do award Valor, and there will also be a questgiver that offers what is effectively a &quot;random daily Challenge mode&quot; quest for bonus Valor. If you have a group of friends with whom you enjoy running dungeons, Challenge modes will offer among the most lucrative sources of weekly Valor, even if you fail to medal. And if you have a skilled group, as you suggest, I suspect your wish is already a reality.

Pet Battle Training Cost<br />
So do Pet Battles still require you to be Level 90 to do them?<br />
To take part in the system you have to be level 5 and pay up 100g.<br />
<br />
On another note, 100g seems like it may be a bit restricting to new players. I wonder if this is the intent. I can see new players wanting to try out Pet Battles, although they probably already have a lot on their plate as it is with all the other features currently in the game.<br />
That's the current thinking. It's essentially a low, but notable barrier to entry to try to avoid distracting new players who may not know it's a mini-game that's very much auxiliary to the leveling experience.<br />
<br />
None of this is completely final though, so everyone is welcome to provide feedback on any part of the system (including the cost of training) on the new forum. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/229766-major-patch-for-mop-beta/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6079790002?page=3#58))<br />

PvPers Slapped With Unnecessary Restriction<br />
I ask Blizz why are PvPers smacked with this restriction but PvErs are not? While they are getting all of their fancy mounts on their mains to use on alts, we PvPers don't have this option. This means more RBGs on more toons, and more honor farming.<br />
<br />
I say we should have the same rights as PvErs. The whole point of everything being account wide now was to have it be about the player, not the toon. By restricting us PvPers of this feature you contradict yourselves. We, the players, earned the PvP mounts just like the PvErs. So please, allow us to take advantage of this as well.<br />
No one is being &quot;slapped&quot; or &quot;smacked&quot; with anything here. The current feeling though is that if you earned a PvP mount on a specific character (class) it was a symbol of your PvP prowess with that particular class. I'm sure you could say that this should (or could) apply to PvE, but I don't think people quite associate these the same. <br />
<br />
Feel free to discuss this (constructively) further if you wish, but just know this is not an attempt on our end to treat PvPers badly or to &quot;slap&quot; anyone &quot;in the face&quot;. This is more of a nod to your ability with a specific class in PvP.<br />
<br />
*Just a quick amendment, I'm reading through the thread and we'll be sure to pass on feedback. I'm not just tossing in an off the cuff statement then running away.<br />
<br />
Yes it may be a pain in the butt to get all over again on another toon, but you still feel SOME accomplishment for getting it again on a whole new toon/class, right?<br />
I've seen others in this thread say they would want the Gladiator Mount to be account-wide, so that contradicts your sentiments here. I'm just curious as to how many agree with them being restricted vs. being account-wide. <br />
<br />
Again, I'm following along the discussion and can carry on feedback, just be aware that doesn't guarantee a change.

<br />
Content Difficulty and Consumption Speed<br />
1% had good reason to stand around looking good while people stood there gasping at there achievements. It was the desire to be<br />
I'm yet to see someone that actually gasped at another player. (Don't confuse this with players being surprised with what top guilds were accomplishing in their realms or even as world firsts, is not the same). It's one of those things that's kinda always been there as some kind of justification about why things were better back then.<br />
<br />
Most of the whispers I was getting back then where &quot;where did you get that from?&quot; from players that were new to the game or even the whole genre and hadn't seen those things. And perhaps, questions from less progressed raiders about how were defeating a given boss.<br />
<br />
Back in earlier expansions you had to progress for a long time to reach another raid content and that felt so damn amazing.<br />
What was so amazing about knowing that you weren't going to make it into the next tier of content? I mean, the journey you mention has always been there. <br />
<br />
If you were around when raiding began in Wrath of the Lich King, by the end of the expansion you had visited Naxxramas, Obsidian Sanctum, Eye of Eternity, Ulduar, Trial of the Crusader and Icecrown Citadel.<br />
<br />
If you were around when raiding began in Cataclysm, you've gone through Blackwing Descent, Throne of the Four Winds, Bastion of Twilight, Firelands and Dragon Soul. <br />
<br />
The only difference with TBC and Vanilla in that regard, is that now there are alternative means to allow players to catch up with the newest content.<br />
<br />
You have worked so hard to allow everyone to see the final raid of an expansion, that you've forgotten what would become of the first tier of raids. If there was progression involved between tiers, we (I) would have the chance of doing them.<br />
The first tier of raids were seen by many as well. If you weren't around then, sure, you missed that content when it was current (and that sucks). <br />
<br />
If there was this requirement of starting from the first tier of the expansion, and then progressing from there all the way to Deathwing. Wouldn't you feel frustrated (and perhaps, even feel unfairly treated) if at some point in your progression, the new expansion comes out, everyone moves on, and you are just forced to not see raids that were actually current content at the moment you were playing? <br />
<br />
Would it really be satisfying to leave Deathwing behind, untouched, simply because you were away from the game and joined too late? (for whatever reason, be it because you chose to, or because you had to, it doesn't matter).<br />
<br />
The current approach still lets you experience these &quot;old raids&quot;, at your own pace, when (and if) you want to, while experiencing the newest content in the game.<br />
<br />
If this is your view of loot, why the hell do you even bother making legendary items? Only a small handful of players will see them, and according to you, only arrogance makes someone want to obtain an item not many players will see.<br />
I'd hope people that go after legendaries go because they find them awesome for what they are, what they bring to the table, etc. Not because they are thinking &quot;Oh lord, how much I'm going to brag about this!&quot;. It's not that bragging is bad, come on. If you're proud of something go and show it, by all means. <br />
<br />
But don't try to use the &quot;we should be able to brag about something&quot; as the argument to justify excluding other players of content. <br />
<br />
Why is it fine that someone can brag about a legendary, but the casual player that wants to brag about how hard was for him/her getting the Molten Front mount gets laughed at? As I've said in the past, everything has as much value as you want to place on it, not more, not less. <br />
<br />
almost everyone had content to do at any one time that was challenging.<br />
Unless you have an 8/8 Heroic character, you obviously still have content that is challenging to complete (not saying you don't have one).<br />
<br />
why is it better in your eyes that I should kill Deathwing but not Ragnaros or Sinestra? (due to another break in the game, I never killed them either; yet general concensus is that actually they were far better encounters than Deathwing and his Dragon Soul cronies)<br />
You should kill them all. The difference is that if you are in the point where you can kill Deathwing, the only thing preventing you from killing Ragnaros and Sinestra is finding other like-minded players to go back and defeat those bosses. Unlike the other way around, where it's not just a matter of finding other individuals to complete that content, it's also a matter of continuing to complete a road that you might not be able to in hopes of getting to see that final boss.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Do it while its current&quot; when i have Exams or i am looking for a Job does not fly.<br />
So, you think it's better to find out that, after coming back from those exams/finding a job and realizing that now everyone is even farther from you is a positive thing?<br />
<br />
Honestly all I see from your posts is arguing with players who are giving you their honest opinions about the state of the raiding game, and defending the development team's design decisions. You should be listening to these (many) players and passing their genuine feedback upstairs, rather than trying to tell them how they should or shouldn't feel.<br />
That's actually the point of my posts. There's no genuine feedback in &quot;TBC was great, bring it back&quot;. That's an opinion, as valid as that of the player next door saying &quot;I hated TBC&quot;. But it's one that doesn't have anything useful for the developers to consider. I'm not telling anyone how they should feel. What I'm trying to do is to present you the opposite perspective. I'm trying to make you cross the street and see things from the other side. Because that's one of the best ways to have a discussion going on. If we keep it one-sided, there wouldn't be much discussion on pretty much anything.<br />
<br />
You want everyone to see Deathwing because, for some abstract reason it would be absolutely crippling for a player to finish the expansion but not fight him, but at the same time for those who missed the other 75% of Cataclysm raiding content, it just 'sucks for you'.<br />
There's no contradiction. The only meaning of &quot;and that sucks&quot; is that not being able to experience it as the current content when it was released is unfortunate. <br />
I do think is still a better prospect than having to experience it when you're in a new expansion because you were always behind of what, for the other players, was actually &quot;current content&quot;.

FEEDBACK: Temple of the Jade Serpent (Challenge)<br />
The Dungeon Journal only reflects Normal and Heroic abilities, and does not have a separate section for any added mechanics on Challenge mode. Consider that part of the challenge, as it were. <br />

In the case of Befouled Waters, you may want to take a look at the buffs visible on the boss during the fight, as well as the combat log tooltip of the effect that is killing you, for a hint.

<br />
A few relevant testing notes:<br />
<br />
You must have completed the Heroic version of the dungeon once in order to attempt the challenge mode. Item level will be normalized to 463. There is no queue system for challenge modes; groups must be formed manually and you must zone in from the outside world. The current Gold/Silver/Bronze times are not final. While the challenge is active, the group leader may Reset the dungeon at any time via a drop-down accessible by right-clicking your unit frame. You may want to dig up those dusty keybindings for things like crowd control and interrupts. Enemies in Challenge mode dungeons are 1 level higher than in Heroic versions, as a rule, such that bosses are now level 93.<br />

If you speak to the large pandaren gentleman on the northwestern side of Halfhill, in the center of Valley of the Four Winds, he will teleport you into the instance at whatever difficulty you currently have specified, including Challenge.

<br />
Many of us are with Dalaran as our homepoint in Cata, due to there being portal to the Caverns Of Time there and Org/SW.<br />
<br />
So In Mop we will set our Hearth to our MOP capital, and can go to Thunderbluff/Silverwind/ Ironforge, etc to do our auctionning business and hearth back.<br />
Even people who get to 90 quickly and then want to go back and do low level profession work will want to set hearth in MOP since it will make getting around the world faster, especially for archealogy/cooking/fishing/herbalism and mining.</div></div><hr />

What is supposedly so 'fulfilling' to some to wait on a dock for a boat that load screens you back to SW over a portal that does it instantly? What about putting yourself on a bird and alt tabbing out during the ten minute flight makes portals so repulsive to people that it brings about such venom from a few? Is the amount of time before a loading screen of flying over the same scenery for the 5478th time satisfying in some way that I have yet to discover in the last 8 years? I'm not being sarcastic I'm actually asking because this seems like it's a very good change in theory.</div></div><hr />

Uhm, isn't this like just what they're doing? Granted, it's not perfect, but still a step in the right direction. Cata portals probably aren't that much needed anymore, so while its true that transmogrification, reforging and honor vendors yet remain in Stormwind, AH is the primary reason why you'll want to go to one of your faction's home cities. How would it have been better being stuck in Pandaria capital, then? At least we will now have more variety. No, you don't have to sit in Stormwind with this change, you can go to Darnassus, Exodar or Ironforge if you wish.</div></div><hr />

We still have to be in Orgrimmar/Stormwind for the same reason you stated, all the vendors are there, transmog and reforging is there, and really the only thing the other cities have is AH and bank access which simply isn't enough. I would prefer to be &quot;stuck&quot; in the new Pandaren city than to have to hang around Orgrimmar for another two sodding years!<br />
<br />
If anything, add all vendors and services that exist in Orgrimmar, in all other capital cities so we actually get to choose where to be. Or scatter them around the world, just don't stack them up in OG.</div></div><hr />

Still, I don't understand how this change is worse. The only thing they removed from the Pandaria city was the Auction House, and replaced them with portals. Now you can choose whether you want to go to IF/TB, Darnassus/UC or Exodar/SMC to do the AH business instead.<br />
<br />
Vendors will most likely be in the new Pandaren city anyway. So the only real reason to go to SW/Org is for transmogrification and reforging, and while I agree it would be good if they added those in every city, that is not something that you'll need every day.</div></div><hr />

Those services are the only reason I have my HS in Dalaran (which has a portal to Orgrimmar) and not in Silvermoon, which I prefer far more. The reason I don't like the portals is because I was looking forward to not having that crap again and instead letting people use ships/zeppelins, like they talked so much about when Cataclysm was released and they removed most of the portals from Dalaran. Now it's Wrath all over again...</div></div><hr />

It really is, and it's even sadder how blindly they defend themselves that the content they're producing is just as good if not BETTER than the last 2 expansions. I think blizzard needs to get off their high horse and understand that there is a REASON they lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers this expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You're right, there was .... and it was because the start of it was TOO. HARD. The only people who need to get off their high horse, are those of the player base who continually cry about wanting the content like it was in Classic and TBC. You want to complain it was better and that the Casual is being greedy wanting it faceroll easy, but you can still SEE the content. <br />
<br />
What the 1% is demanding would make it so only they can see it, which is by far the most selfish and greedy thing I have seen. I played since Classic and I LIKE how it works now, Classic was fun when it was current but all MMOs, not just wow are moving from that game play style. If WoW continued to make things as difficult as it was in TBC almost everyone but that 1% would leave to play games that allowed them to see the content. ALL OF IT.<br />
<br />
Yet reasoning with any one who is demanding the difficulty be returned is like trying to reason with a wall. They care little for anyone but their %1 and thankfully Blizzard is not inclined to listen.</div></div><hr />

Because you can use them in places OTHER than capital cities where said portals are not available.<br />

Again, I still don't understand why sitting on a dock or a tower waiting for a ship/zepplin is somehow more satisfying to some than simply clicking on a portal to do the exact same thing the others do but without the wait.</div></div><hr />

Reforger yes, transmorger no.<br />
<br />
The vale city has become less and less like a real city while im glad to have portals back i would prefer they add an AH/transmorger/void storage in every city<br />

Because it removes what little immersion feeling is left in the game. If we travel everywhere through portals and other teleporting means we pretty much remove the world in World of Warcraft.<br />

You use them to fly to places that aren't capital cities and thus don't have portals? If there was a quicker route there then why wouldn't you use it? Would there be a point to seeing the same scenery you've already seen a dozen times or more? I don't get more immersed in the game from getting on a taxi and flying over burning steppes for the god only knows how many times, and have at least a somewhat hard time accepting that many others do either. If you do enjoy it then go for it. It seems to be the fact that anyone else can that's upsetting you, so if it doesn't ruin their immersion then why does that bother you?</div></div><hr />

Except that we are a world filled with high magic. It makes no sense for heroes to have to use archaic modes of transportation to get to major cities. <br />

You still need your mounts to get to places outside (or even inside most) cities.</div></div><hr />

Though I love how its another CATAfail decision that Bliz is having to reverse. What was it they said? Having no portals was good for the game....lol.<br />

It bothers me because the zeppelins purpose disappears with the portals. So does the ships, and the tram. Why make them in the first place if everyone travels by portal anyways? Your argument that there is no point in seeing something you have already seen seems trivial considering you probably play the same dungeons and battlegrounds over and over, haven't you done that before? You should be sick of them already? I do use the zeppelins myself but oh is it fun to see that I am yet again the only one using it for the hundredth time? I want to see other people using them as well or else I might as well set up my own private server.<br />

You still need your mounts to get to places outside (or even inside most) cities.<br />
Ok so let's remove mounts and flypaths altogether, our characters are too good for something like that and only the best of the best is good enough for them, in this case portals to wherever we have to go.</div></div><hr />

He seems pretty in touch with it to me. The people whining and screaming at him are entitled babies that want to have something shiney and otherwise-worthless and let no one else have what they've got, even if they eventually put forth the same effort and skill they did but just not at the same timeline.<br />
<br />
Setting up game content so that half of a percent of a game community only gets to experience it or enjoy the rewards of doing it is simply wasting the time of 99.5% of everyone else who pays and plays the same game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Ogdru Jahad</div><div class="date">2012-07-15, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right, there was .... and it was because the start of it was TOO. HARD. The only people who need to get off their high horse, are those of the player base who continually cry about wanting the content like it was in Classic and TBC. You want to complain it was better and that the Casual is being greedy wanting it faceroll easy, but you can still SEE the content. <br />
<br />
What the 1% is demanding would make it so only they can see it, which is by far the most selfish and greedy thing I have seen. I played since Classic and I LIKE how it works now, Classic was fun when it was current but all MMOs, not just wow are moving from that game play style. If WoW continued to make things as difficult as it was in TBC almost everyone but that 1% would leave to play games that allowed them to see the content. ALL OF IT.<br />
<br />
Yet reasoning with any one who is demanding the difficulty be returned is like trying to reason with a wall. They care little for anyone but their %1 and thankfully Blizzard is not inclined to listen.<br />
<br />
No one is asking for a difficulty boost to early Cata levels. People want a return to the tried and true models that worked in BC and wotlk, the models that attracted people to the game and KEPT them addicted. Blizzard thought it would be wise to lower the difficulty and increase the accessibility, but with that they took away all incentives to work and strive to be better at the game, and the grinds and motivations to get better gear etc all kept people playing. Lowering the difficulty isn't what will keep people entertained. There is a reason a huge debate regarding the game lately has been about the speed at which people consume content.</div></div><hr />

That's their underlying true motive for the accessible (and stupidly easy) content. <br />
<br />
Ofc, it was kinda crazy back in the days of original Naxx. But TBC had the balance nailed down pretty well--there was a set path that each guild had to follow to progress. Going from Kara to BT was a long and rewarding journey through the expansion. If locking players to a set path makes people nauseous, then WotLK did away with it, but at least had a difficulty level that allowed killing new bosses to be rewarding. Cata ripped that out too, and now all we're left with is guilds skipping to the newest tier regardless of when they were formed and knocking over bosses. The main complaint is that kills don't feel rewarding at all anymore, but Activision knows all too well that there are better ways of making money than making a good product, so they just ignore that. <br />
<br />
Bottom line: They keep saying that its better for the game and its what the 'majority' of players want. Bullshit, Blizz just wants more money, and their PR people are doing a terrible job of hiding it.</div></div><hr />

Agreed completely! I don't know if this was one of the posts you meant, but it is one of the prime examples for me. It's not a contradiction just because he says it isn't? His reasoning behind it doesn't change it at all. To me &quot;current content&quot; IS that expansion, not just the newest patch! I hate having to move on to the newest raid because it's easy higher item level loot to get when I haven't gotten a chance to finish off the previous tier with my guild (we're usually just 1-2 bosses from clearing it fully on heroic). The fact that you can get better or comparable gear from new 5-mans and VP every patch than you can from the previous tier is terrible in my opinion as well. I could keep going back and pushing the previous tier with my guild like the blue post suggests, but that doesn't happen! The focus of raids is always the race to finish the newest content and get the newest best gear regardless of how much of the previous tier you've completed. This makes the previous tier instantly worthless in the eyes of raid progression as soon as the newest tier and patch content comes out. Sometimes I don't think Blizz understands the mindset of raiders. For the most part, they pick the path that is most efficient towards getting the newest end-goal, and that does not include going back to finish the previous tier. The bosses I've spent the least amount of time on (and I would guess the average numbers would support me on this) were end bosses for middle of the expansion tiers. Bosses like Kael'thas in BC, Algalon in WotLK, and Sinestra in Cata are probably some of the least seen content in WoW. Is that intentional? Will raid finder fix this in the future? If they're going to have &quot;elite&quot; bosses like Algalon and Sinestra, I would much rather have them at least be part of the very last tier of an expansion which ends up &quot;current content&quot; for the longest amount of time. That might give some incentive for people to keep playing at the end of an expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand, back in TBC, less than 1% of the player base saw Sunwell Plateau. While this made it bragging rights for those that completed it, Blizzard realized they made this beautiful epic dungeon that so few people actually got to experience.

&quot;You want raiding gear? Go do heroics. What's that? No one is doing them? Go PvP then and bash your head against the grinder until you miraculously manage to eek out the required amount of Marks and Honor (and rinse and repeat many times). You got your gear? Great. The latest raid is Sunwell, but you're only good enough for Karazhan, so that's the only raid you'll be doing -- ever -- because no one will be wanting to go back to really old content to farm gear so that little ol' you can catch up.

And I've got to say, I'm actually in agreement with the removal of AH from Pandaria. Shattrath originally didn't, and Dalaran's used to be for proficient engineers only. Why should Pandaria be any different in this regard? Portals are a much better bargain anyway, especially with the removal of the &quot;Have Group, Will Travel&quot; guild perk.</div></div><hr />

Except here's the difference. If it's in, you have the option of not using it and thus ruining your immersion while it still leave others the option of using it if doing so doesn't bother them.

<br />
Scroll of resurrection gives free faction change (for 1 toon)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I find the comments on current raid content completely contradictory. They say they want everyone to experience the top level of content when it's current, because otherwise it would not be fair, but then say it's completely fair for people to not experience the first tiers of raiding when it's current, because they have the option to go back to complete it later. So how does that differ? You can always go back to do what was the top level of content in the next expansion by getting a group of like-minded people to do the bosses.<br />
<br />
e.g:<br />
You joined at the end of WoTLK and you missed Naxx, but it's ok because you can do it while your guild is clearing ICC or Cataclysm. <br />
You couldn't complete ICC before Cataclysm was released (e.g. you didn't play enough / weren't good enough), you can go back to complete it after Cataclysm is out, but that's not ok with Blizzard. <br />
<br />
Both scenarios you will completely overpower the instances you missed, so although if you have Cataclysm gear/level 90 you will kill WoTLK content with ease (can solo half of it), you could still walk over Naxx with ICC gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They removed the portals because they wanted Orgrimmar and Stormwind to become the hubs, since they were designed to have all the new zone portals and would help split the population a bit better. They were worried that with a bunch of portals in Dalaran and Shattrath, that most players would still use those towns for the hubs since they were extra convenient, thus keeping the overcrowding issue that Dalaran suffered in WOTLK on some servers.<br />
<br />
They did this for awhile, before finally adding a Stormwind/Orgrimmar portal back to Dalaran and Shattrath for leveling player convenience. They didn't add back portals to the other cities though because that would have caused people to gravitate back to those locations. Since they want people to use the cities in Pandaria, they added back to portals as an extra incentive and bringing back old convenience.<br />
<br />
I personally use Dalaran as my main hub because it has all I need in a nice compact space, with little crowding now, and the portal to Stormwind/Orgrimmar lets me get back quickly to use the zone portals.</div></div><hr />

You completely missed the point of my post. There is nothing stopping me from going back and finishing that content, except for the fact that it has then dropped on the priority list of things to do. And it is most definitely NOT about epeen! I'm admitting that I'm not in a hardcore guild that finishes all hardmode content before new content comes out. The current system caters to two very unique groups imo. The hardcore that finish everything quickly and are sitting there twiddling their thumbs waiting for new content, and the very casual raiders that didn't get into the previous tier. What's stopping those &quot;like minded&quot; casual people from raiding the previous tier when it isn't current so they can move on to the newest one after that? I worked my way up through the ranks of raids in Vanilla and BC and it was VERY rewarding! I wasn't the first to access content, and that is okay. My guild in BC finished Sunwell just before the last patch before WotLK came out and that was a lot of fun. I'm not advocating going back to the BC model, but something between that and the current system would be ideal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was happy with the portals in Wrath, but they're going to be removing the mass summon for the same reason the portals where originally removed?<br />
<br />
kinda happy with that with a raid only a few ppl take the time to go to the entrance rest just waiting for a summon</div></div><hr />

My thinking is that maybe just maybe they are getting tired of the self entitled whiney special snowflakes who all they can do is complain about the other 99% of the players getting to tread on their most sacred ground that being raids and whatever else they can complain about WoW.. And those same whiney snowflakes complain they don't get their recognition for raiding which Blizz has now done to some extent with special achievements for doing the new raids without the debuff.<br />
<br />
But I ask you this how long would it be before you were doing the same thing that you say they are doing now after having to look, listen and put up with what is said on the Blizz forums. And before you counter &quot;they are paid to do put up with it.&quot; Well yes that is true but they are people like us and they have feelings too you know, they are not robots that have no feelings at all. So just think for a minute before going off about them as one day we could be in that same position.</div></div><hr />

You could not be more wrong if you tried. People want challenging content because it feels good to beat the content and it feels good to get rewarded for it. Cataclysm's heroics were a great example pre-nerf, they weren't impossible but if you didn't use crowd control on some of the trickier pulls or if you stood in the fire you died. That's what people want, challenging but rewarding and entirely doable.</div></div><hr />

That's not what the person you replied to was getting at. People wanting challenges and nothing more are fine, it's the people who don't care for the challenge and want to special shinies that set them apart from others, only to whine and complain when the special shinies become easier to get.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they're playing the wrong game or genre then, there are plenty of decent &quot;casual&quot; games out there.</div></div><hr />

You are right there, I like content to be challenging too, what I was trying to say was what half of the questions that were put to the blues.</div></div><hr />
