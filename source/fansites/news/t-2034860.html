Achievement - Fashionista: Shirt<br />
When looking at the initial data from players that had a Fashionista achievement, we saw that only 20% of the players that had one of the achievements had the Fashionista: Shirt (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10691-fashionista-shirt) achievement. Complete all of the Fashionista achievements to earn Fabulous (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10694-fabulous), which rewards the Fabulous (http://www.wowdb.com/titles/477-the-fabulous) title!<br />
<br />
We will take a look at progress on these achievements in a week or two, after everyone has had a chance to finish them up. <br />

holy pally doesn't get 2H-Wep with pre-patch, even though new kit and upcoming artifact are built around that?<br />
Some artifacts (such as Holy Paladin) are meant to break some of the normal &quot;rules,&quot; but aren't needed at level 100. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/755516279746801664))<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
Please bring back the engineer glider/belt for unrated bgs. <br />
These will be back (for unrated BGs only) in a future patch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/755825422449770496))<br />
<br />
Camera Zoom<br />
Please don't let this issue continue to go unaddressed: https://t.co/Eu8daLDTHE (&amp; all related threads)<br />
To be clear, it's absolutely something we care deeply about. Of course we want everyone to be able to enjoy the game. But zoom... (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/755829241011404800))<br />
...distance may have been a bandaid that masked underlying causes of motion sickness. We want to identify and fix those directly. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/755829504510230529))<br />
<br />
Items<br />
people clicking disenchant when people are greeding for offspec gear. would it not be better for a option asking if the player<br />
Need/Greed now strictly prioritizes mainspec &gt; offspec on Need, for reference; Greed is literally just &quot;I want to sell this.&quot; (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/755895983209189377))<br />
<br />
UI<br />
Hey, the low health screen flash could be a legitimate epilepsy issue. Disabling it -needs- to be put back in the menu.<br />
The option to disable it wasn't removed! It's just been moved to the &quot;Combat&quot; category. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/755509502590324737))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Can anyone C/D if Mists content gets the legacy buff when legion goes out? WarcraftDevs<br />
There's no such thing as a &quot;legacy buff&quot; - it was a one-time adjustment to content flattened out by the 6.0 squish. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/755230416995356672))<br />
so Mists content wont get easier once I hit 110? :C<br />
It certainly will, because you'll have several times more health and damage output after leveling and gearing up. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/755232618971475968))<br />

1. There are other reasons it won't say that, and they're not always obvious at a glance.<br />
<br />
If you have learned it, but from a different item. - Then what does it matter??<br />
2. Level requirement of the item also comes into play. You can't mog it a low level character even though that character is high enough to use a different item with the same look.<br />
<br />
If you have learned it, but can't transmog it (wrong armor type or too low level). - Then what does it matter??<br />
3. See part 1.<br />
<br />
If you can learn it. - Will have 'you haven't learned this' text.<br />
4. If this is all that you feel you need then fine.<br />
<br />
If you can't learn it on this character. - Only matters if BoE, and easily checked by mailing.<br />
5. Mailing and relogging to check is a pain in the ass. Also, you might want to know when you're not near a mailbox. Plus, if you find an item you like but can't mog on your current character, you can make note of it and come back and look for the item on a different character.<br />

It's really useful if (like me) you've been hoarding BoEs for months and have a bunch of duplicates you didn't know about. I've been using the addon and it's immensely helpful when going through everything. Generally if it says &quot;learned from a different item&quot; it's a trigger for me that it's probably BoE and I can put it on the AH. It also has an option saying it can be learned on another character, which is another quick way of knowing what's BoE etc. (Just using &quot;can I mail it&quot; to determine BoEs doesn't help when you have lots of different armour types in your bags)<br />
<br />
The &quot;can't learn it&quot; option is also really helpful because there are some items I thought might have been able to be added to the collection that can't, such as some goggles, blue world event clothing etc - some can be mogged and some can't, so it's nice to know what can't be so I don't accidentally delete it. <br />
<br />
If you don't have a lot of transmog to go through, then sure it's not the addon for you. But it's been really helpful for me! :)</div></div><hr />

If you have learned it. - Then it won't have the 'you haven't learned this' text<br />
<br />
I like seeing at a glance that, yes, I've learned that appearance. Visual cues and all that jazz.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have learned it, but from a different item. - Then what does it matter??<br />
<br />
It matters because while the appearance is saved account-wide, you can't transmog a specific item if you haven't learned that specific item. For someone like me who wants to transmog an actual complete set (but may have other items that use the same artwork), this is quite helpful.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have learned it, but can't transmog it (wrong armor type or too low level). - Then what does it matter??<br />
<br />
Because then I'll still know that it's been learned regardless of the character's level that I'm on.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can learn it. - Will have 'you haven't learned this' text.<br />
<br />
Bigger text size with a better font color. Much better than what Blizzard decided on.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can't learn it on this character. - Only matters if BoE, and easily checked by mailing.<br />
<br />
Oh sure, just send a mail, log, and then re-log to check the item on a different character. Yeah, no.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can't learn it (necks, trinkets, rings, etc.). - Then what does it matter??<br />
<br />
The only point I'll (partially) agree with you on. I'm not sure why it does a check on necklaces, trinkets, rings and non-equippable items, but either the addon author is working on it or it's a case of technical limitation. I do appreciate seeing the &quot;cannot be learned&quot;, though, for items that one would think could be learned but can't. Without this addon, you simply would have no idea either way as to its learn-ability without having to look it up. Saves me time -- and currency -- that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Easily checked by mailing&quot; is one of the #1 reasons why this addon is helpful. You avoid that step of having to mail the item, log on that character, check, and then log back. When I had literally hundreds of items I needed to &quot;check&quot; at the start of this patch, this addon saved me so much time. Poo poo it if you like, but it is useful.</div></div><hr />

This is the use case that matters. If you want to mail three quarters of the BoE greens you find off to other characters because you have no idea whether you've learned them yet or not, be my guest. I spent 30 seconds installing this tiny addon and never have to wonder again. <br />
<br />
Seriously, I've been running instances for transmogs this weekend and with limited bag space, knowing which greens I want and which I don't care about is a massive boon.<br />
<br />
Two thumbs up for the &quot;Can I Mog It?&quot; addon.</div></div><hr />

A bunch of people (including myself) aren't upset over the zoom per se, it's some other changes that got snuck in quietly with the zoom changes such as increased camera shaking/movement and other motion sickness-inducing effects. The old zoom work-arounds were sometimes necessary for people to play the game without getting motion sickness. There is currently no option to turn off the shaking effects (the options for action camera/physics interaction currently in the game do not help).</div></div><hr />

Of course. The use case I'm talking about is &quot;I run dungeon on my Priest; green BoE plate helmet drops; have I learned that appearance on my account yet or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
Can't answer that question with the default UI (it does not show the &quot;You haven't collected this appearance&quot; message). Can answer it with &quot;Can I Mog It?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you gonna need a green for mog.. with the addon.. why not just need it default since you gonna sell it in the end. soon as you get &quot;said&quot; green item its added.. and the default ui does show if you learn it or not. (atlest it shows on beta). meh shrugs.<br />

The &quot;Snuck&quot; in changes was posted tho so it wasnt really snuck in. Only thing i notice is Zoom lol. action cam can be turn off. Camera shaking you hardly even notice it. if your camera shakes then i guess riding a mount must suck cuz thats been around forever. dunno still having hard time understanding the issue. i tank and hate fact that you see bosses balls 90% of the time when smash on the wall. Guess these people never gonna get VR or any real other games that have camera physics :\ just shocked. i get affected by motion sickness but not from wow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there's also the issues of class sets which share some looks with items that are non set. if you have the set version the wardobe says you've unlocked the lookm but without non set versions, only the class the set belongs to will be able to mog the look. <br />
The mod is very useful at really no loss or cost to those who want to use it I don't understand why y'all are trying to point out the subjective uselessness of it ???</div></div><hr />

I could be mistaken, but I believe that if you can't &quot;equip&quot; the green (e.g., mail on a warrior), the default UI won't tell you if you have learned that appearance or not.<br />
<br />
You've got to examine it on a character that can equip/learn it (right armor, right level, in some cases right class), which means you've got to mail them to the correct character to be sure.<br />
<br />
With this add-on, it searches through your collection to see what has been learned, so it saves you the steps of mailing it around.<br />

Leaving all that aside, how often are the shirts seen? I mean, I have a tabard on, and under that I have a breastplate/pauldrons/bracers. And under THAT, I have a snazzy &quot;guild officer&quot; shirt.<br />
<br />
So do they show up in the &quot;View Character&quot; screen, or what?<br />
<br />
I've already got Fashionista on all slots, but I'll be buying the cheaper shirts soon. Not that I can actually SEE them...</div></div><hr />

It offers useful functions that are otherwise not covered by the default tooltip. Such as not needing to check the status of an item by having to mail it to a character of the appropriate armor or wield type first, for example.<br />

<br />
Your comment is ignorant. Those who have been discussing the camera zoom in the forums since it came up had by and large already been aware of the view distance slider being reset to the default in the Interface. It's about Blizzard altering the related CVar functions so players can no longer set the zoom beyond that whichis allowed by the interface (which had been around as long as this game).</div></div><hr />

I don't think level matters - before I got this addon, I mailed some plate to my DK that he was too low-level to equip (don't have a level 100 plate wearer) and I'm sure it showed the indication OK.<br />
<br />
But it definitely won't show unless the armour type matches your class.<br />

<br />
I'm pretty sure that you have to be able to equip it, to be able to get the 'mog.<br />
<br />
My level 35 mage has access to 11 head slots (including 3 cosmetic goggles and naval hats, 4 level-appropriate including cloth heirloom, and 4 level 85-100 restricted). So I don't have much choice (7, including the heirloom piece he's currently wearing) for his head appearance (though I'll probably end up using the cosmetic &quot;Fel-Proof Goggles&quot;...).<br />
<br />
My level 100 warlock has the class-mog-610 from the salvage yard, so he has a total of 12 head slots, but with no level restrictions. So class-specific does restrict things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a small, stupid thing that some people knew about, and some didn't. It's not game changing or breaking, it's been around 11 years. But now all of a sudden it cannot exist - that says to me it breaks something in Legion, that they don't want to design differently for, that somehow the camera helps you see something you shouldn't, or get past content easily - the same reasons why they dug their heels in on in flying for WOD - it was all design decisions.<br />
<br />
Ion just doesn't learn. Stock up on popcorn! This whole issue could have been solved by reverting the camera change, and continued to work on the issue of what causes sickness for some players. But noooooooo....lol. <br />

Now, they are just going to have to get used to seeing things close up. Motion sickness!? Really? Sure people can have some effects from rapid moving objects, hell I do if I am not controlling the character...I can not watch Overwatch streams because it makes me feel sick. Riding on someone elses mount..yep, same thing. Some people can/do have effects of motion sickness, but come on, the camera change is not THAT bad, and even it is, you are in a HEAVY minority of people. They will gain more people then they will lose over this if the game is more &quot;immersive&quot;. And before you say &quot;lots of people feel this way, just look at the forums&quot; Half of those people are there arguing with the other half on how it is ok, and the half of those people who hate the change, are posting MULTIPLE times trying to get people to agree with them. In the end, a VERY VERY small portion of the players see the camera zoom as an issue. Blizzard does not have to, and is obviously not going to, change it based on a few hundred people complaining about it.<br />
<br />
Overall, there is nothing wrong with the camera zoom. It goes out far enough, and I am one who used the max distance console code. It is just the flavor of the month bitch fest with people right now, in a month when they realize their tantrum isn't working, they will find something else to complain about.</div></div><hr />

It's an issue related to the latest update (7.0.3.13) last night.<br />
<br />
UPDATE: Update to v7.0.3.14. This version won't have certain functions that were added in v7.0.3.13, which were causing the issue.</div></div><hr />

Let me guess, you can tank just fine without color options because you aren't colorblind too so forget those color blind folks, right?<br />
<br />
If you're fine with how things are then that's great. Let the other people who are not find speak up and be heard. Why does that bother you?</div></div><hr />

Because a lot of people here choose to be contrary, just for the sake of being contrary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have learned it. - Then it won't have the 'you haven't learned this' text<br />
If you have learned it, but from a different item. - Then what does it matter??<br />
If you have learned it, but can't transmog it (wrong armor type or too low level). - Then what does it matter??<br />
If you can learn it. - Will have 'you haven't learned this' text.<br />
If you can't learn it on this character. - Only matters if BoE, and easily checked by mailing.<br />
If you can't learn it (necks, trinkets, rings, etc.). - Then what does it matter??<br />
<br />
Actually it's a great addon. They didn't do it justice in the explanation. Say you have boe cloth and your on a plate it will inform you if your clothy has already learned it or not so you know whether to vendor it or mail it to that toon. I really like not having the extra step of having to log out from the character I'm on only to find out that I already know it and could've just vendored it.</div></div><hr />

If I wanted an image to go with the tooltip, I'd use MogIt. Whatever works for you, though.</div></div><hr />

So no, you won't be able to kill anything more than you could before because we're going to be a steady treadmill now where the power increases every 10 levels are no longer significantly, but just barely a few percentage points better.</div></div><hr />

All I said was that it seems redundant. Granted, there are probably a lot of addons I'd think are redundant. If it helps you guys, then kudos for that.</div></div><hr />

The ability to earn the Warcraft Movie transmog items is going away next week (August 1 (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/412752-warcraft-movieinspired-transmog-items-now-available/)), so be sure to log in and get them if you haven't already! <br />

This has probably been asked and answered before, but are these account-wide unlocks? I don't have active subscription at the moment, so was thinking of logging to trial-character to obtain them. Got both achievements but can't find them anywhere on Achievement -list, and since it's trial I can't open mailbox to retrieve the weapons.</div></div><hr />

The items are BoA, so if you have them, you should be able to send them to any character, and anyway, their looks should just be added to your wardrobe (just don't send them to opposite faction's character, I heard of some cases when doing that turned the item into other faction's equivalent, and I guess they couldn't get it back? Best not to risk it I think).<br />
<br />
As for the achievement, it's in Feats of Strength -&gt; Promotions, check there (you should have two, for Horde and Alliance separately, as long as you've logged onto both factions' characters - &quot;Fight for the Alliance&quot; and &quot;Fight for the Horde&quot;).<br />
If you don't have them, try making a GM ticket and asking for a day or two of free gametime, worked for me, when I had some in-game mail about to expire.</div></div><hr />

I did Firelands over the weekend and on Alysrazor when she comes out the screen shakes so violently I can't see anything that's going on. Same experience with the Al'Akir transition between phases in Four Winds.<br />
<br />
I don't think it was a bug, I think it was a change that was made with all the other camera/graphics stuff they've been adding. My boyfriend did find a script that helped some, but not a whole lot: /console actionCam off. <br />
<br />
I did read in the hotfixes for today that they reduced the camera shaking. I have not been able to test it out yet though.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;Snuck&quot; in changes was posted tho so it wasnt really snuck in. Only thing i notice is Zoom lol. action cam can be turn off. Camera shaking you hardly even notice it. if your camera shakes then i guess riding a mount must suck cuz thats been around forever. dunno still having hard time understanding the issue. i tank and hate fact that you see bosses balls 90% of the time when smash on the wall. Guess these people never gonna get VR or any real other games that have camera physics :\ just shocked. i get affected by motion sickness but not from wow.<br />
<br />
Except they really weren't well documented. That's great that it doesn't really affect you, but for people with vertigo, epilepsy, and other serious ailments, it does. Every other game I play, the first thing I do is turn off screen shaking effects. The camera shaking because of physics in an encounter and while riding a mount are two totally different effects (also, you can turn off the &quot;bob&quot; while running/mounting). The outrage is because it was something that got added that wasn't there before and affects people negatively in a real-world way without adding any value to the game. The zoom is a whole other (separate) issue, one with both legit and non-legit complaints, imo.</div></div><hr />
