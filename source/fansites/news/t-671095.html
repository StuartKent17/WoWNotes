Auction House Guide - Inscription<br />
Welcome to the second part of the wonderful Auction House guide, this time I will explain why a few people can make tons of money out of Inscription. If you thought that the Enchanting part was fun, you're going to have a good laugh with this one. <br />
<br />
Leveling Inscription<br />
I'll start with the basics, most people didn't bother checking Inscription when it was released and I think a huge part of the playerbase just doesn't know exactly how it works. (Note: DO NOT sell any of the glyph you will craft during your leveling, just keep them for later)<br />
<br />
You buy herbs from the Auction House (or gather them, obviously) and mill them to get pigments. Then you use these pigments to craft inks, then you need one (or two in a few cases) ink and a parchment bought from the NPC to craft a glyph. Most people just buy the herbs from the AH, craft all the inks themselves, and level like that ... Bad idea. <br />
<br />
A few patches ago, Blizzard introduced an &quot;Ink Trader&quot; named Jessica Sellers (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=33027) to the game, this NPC will let you trade the Ink of the Sea (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43126/ink-of-the-sea/) you get by milling any Northrend Herbs for ANY lower level ink. If you want to compare it to other professions, just imagine it as a NPC that will give you Iron and Mithril in echange for Saronite. <br />
<br />
The easiest way to level Inscription is to buy the first tier of low level herbs (because stuff like Peacebloom (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/2447/peacebloom/) or Silverleaf (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/765/silverleaf/) is usually really cheap) and then buy Adder's Tongue (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36903/adders-tongue/), Lichbloom (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36905/lichbloom/), Icethorn (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36906/icethorn/). <br />
<br />
These 3 herbs yields the highest amount of pigments to create the Ink of the Sea (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43126/ink-of-the-sea/) you will need to buy the lower level inks. You can always check the AH every now and then for the lower level herbs if you think it's a cheaper alternative but on most servers, it won't. <br />
<br />
Note that if you are really evil and don't want to level Inscription, you can usually buy Ink of the Sea from the AH and trade it for lower level inks to relist them at the AH with a 100 or 200% margin. People who don't have inscription and need their glyphs often buy the mats from the AH and ask a guildmate to craft them for free, this is where you cash the easy money. <br />
<br />
<br />
Learning new Glyphs<br />
That's the small problem with Inscription, just like Jewelcrafting you won't start with all the recipes and you can't just buy them from the AH or farm them. There are two ways to discover new glyphs : <br />
<br />
Run Minor Inscription Research (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/61288/minor-inscription-research/) and Northrend Inscription Research (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/61177/northrend-inscription-research/) daily. (24 Hours Cooldown)<br />
Buy Book of Glyph Master (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/45912/book-of-glyph-mastery/) to instantly learn a new Glyph recipe. (But this is actually a bad idea) <br />
<br />
Run your research every day as soon as you can, BOTH of them, minor glyphs sell as much as major glyphs. Buying a lot of Book of Glyph Master (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/45912/book-of-glyph-mastery/) sounds tempting but you shouldn't do it for two reasons :<br />
<br />
You cannot discover ALL glyphs with these books, and the inscription research will give you the most used Glyphs most of the time. <br />
A lot of people will start buying and reselling them with a 300% margin as soon as this guide hits the front page. <br />
<br />
Being able to sell more glyphs is always good, in the end you should just decide if Inscription brings enough money to be worth the investment when you start. But keep in mind that some glyphs can only be learned from this book and you will NEED them anyway, so don't hesitate to buy one if something cheap appears at the AH. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Real Price of Glyphs<br />
Why is it so profitable to sell Glyphs? It's easy, on most servers it won't cost you anything to craft them ... Let's say that you buy a stack of Adder's Tongue (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36903/adders-tongue/) / Lichbloom (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36905/lichbloom/) / Icethorn (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36906/icethorn/) for 15 gold, you will get an average of 12 Azure Pigment (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/39343/azure-pigment/) and 4 Icy Pigment (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43109/icy-pigment/) out of each stack. That's 2 x Snowfall Ink (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43127/snowfall-ink/) and 6 x Ink of the Sea (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43126/ink-of-the-sea/) ... <br />
<br />
Snowfall Ink (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43127/snowfall-ink/) is used to craft a few high level items, the Runescroll of Fortitude (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69385/runescroll-of-fortitude/) added with Patch 3.2.2, and Northrend's Darkmoon Card (I'll talk about that later) .... and usually sells for something like 10G at the AH. Yes, you just got 20G worth of Snowfall Ink (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43127/snowfall-ink/) out of a 15G stack of herbs, and the 6 x Ink of the Sea (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43126/ink-of-the-sea/) are a &quot;free&quot; bonus.<br />
<br />
Crafting glyphs costs pretty much nothing and most of your sale will be 100% pure profit. <br />
<br />
<br />
Let's make some Glyphs!<br />
Selling Glyphs is really hard and will require you to do a lot of research to find the most valua.... No, just kidding, you just sell all of them. Trying to figure out what glyph is worth crafting or not is just a waste of time because the glyph market is always moving and ALL glyphs will sell, no matter how bad they are.<br />
<br />
If you just started with inscription you shouldn't be able to craft a lot of glyphs, just start with a short supply of all of them like ... 3 units of each. <br />
<br />
Go to the AH, open the Auctions Tab and click Summary. <br />
Now click Glyphs and Get Data, Quick Auctions will scan the AH for a while<br />
You will end up with a list of glyphs and their price. (Do not pay attention to them, the price of Glyphs move really fast)<br />
Glyphs with a red X next to their name are all the glyphs you cannot create yet<br />
<br />
To craft a glyph, double click its name in the list, type the amount of glyphs you want, and hit enter. Do that for all the glyphs, it shouldn't take more than a minute or two. <br />
<br />
Now open your Inscription tradeskill window and click the small &quot;QA&quot; button at the top right, a new window will appear with the list of all the glyphs you want to craft. <br />
<br />
The bottom of the list will list all the materials you need to craft these glyphs<br />
You can craft a Glyph by clicking its name once.<br />
<br />
At this point you will need to buy parchments from the inscription supplies vendor and all your inks from our good friend Jessica Sellers (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=33027). Just stockpile enough Ink of the Sea to be able to buy everything you need. <br />
<br />
I'll have to admit that I never found an &quot;easy&quot; way to do it (and I'm sure someone will be nice enough to point me to a decent addon to help with that), buying 500 inks at once require you to click 500 times and is just not possible. Personally, I just use FreeRefills (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/free-refills.aspx), for example if you need to buy 137 Lion's Ink just type :<br />
<br />
/freerefills add [Lion's ink] 137<br />
<br />
Please note that you need to use the ITEM LINK and you can't just type the name of the item in the command line. The mod will automatically buy 137 Lion's Ink from the vendor next time you visit it, once you're done make sure you type :<br />
<br />
/freerefills del [Lion's ink]<br />
<br />
You need to delete it once you're done because Free Refills will ALWAYS try to make sure that you have 137 Lion's Ink in your inventory, this is a problem when you use that to buy your parchments, forget about it, and end up with 400 parchments the next time you visit the NPC.<br />
<br />
When all the supplies are in your inventory just sit in front of your screen and click each glyph one by one ... Yes, this is the boring part, no, there is no way to craft all the glyphs at once. Just use that time to start rumors about your raid leader in the guild chat. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/glyphcraft_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/glyphcraft.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/glyphcraftlist_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/glyphcraftlist.jpg)<br />
<br />
(Finally) Selling Glyphs<br />
Now that you understand how Glyphs work, and that all your Glyphs are in your inventory we can finally move to the easy part. Selling!<br />
<br />
Type /qa config and create a new item group called &quot;Glyphs are cool&quot;, the settings are really straightforward:<br />
<br />
Undercut by: 10s<br />
Threshold price: 6g (It depends on your server, really, but 5g or 6g is usually a good threshold) <br />
Fallback price: 59g99S99C (Because it's much cheaper than 60G, really. You can lower or increase it depending on how guilty you feel to sell for that much money) <br />
Fallback after: 100%<br />
Bid percent: 100%<br />
Post cap: 3<br />
Per auction: 1<br />
Post time: 24 hours (or even 12 hours if you spend a lot of time hugging the AH, keep in mind that even if the deposit fees for Glyphs aren't really high you might end up selling 1000 of them at once, that's why 48 hours is usually a bad idea.<br />
<br />
Go to &quot;Add items&quot; and just type &quot;Glyph&quot; in the text field and hit enter. All the items with &quot;Glyph&quot; in their name will be added to this rule. (Make sure you don't have a bunch of Books of Glyph Mastery in your inventory before you do that) <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/glyphgroup_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/glyphgroup.jpg)<br />
<br />
Now just head back to the Auction House and ... Click post! <br />
<br />
That's it, you now have 20 to ... 300 Glyphs at the AH depending on how many of them you sell and how strong the competition is on your server. Just wait a few minutes/hours and loot all the gold flowing in your Mailbox. <br />
<br />
Now let's see if we can increase your productivity. <br />
<br />
<br />
Posting, Looting, and Relisting<br />
If you plan to sell Glyphs regularly: never, ever, ever, ever do that on your main character, on any character you play. Just create an alt. You will craft Glyphs with your main character and sell Glyphs on alts with 4 x Pack of Endless Pockets (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44446).<br />
<br />
You need to do that because as you learn to create more glyphs, you will really start to need a LOT of space in your inventory to sell everything at once. Ultimately you will end up with 3 alts (Selling all the glyphs for 4 or 3 classes on each alt).<br />
<br />
To manage that without too much effort you will need :<br />
<br />
BulkMail2 (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/bulk-mail2.aspx) to send the glyphs to your alts.<br />
BulkMail2 Inbox (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/bulk-mail2inbox.aspx) to loot them.<br />
<br />
BulkMail2 is very interesting because it lets you send automatically items to an alt. For example let's say that you always want to send all the Glyph of Dark Command (http://db.mmo-champion.com/search/all/glyph_of_dark_command/) you craft to your alt named Munin, type :<br />
<br />
/bulkmail autosend add Munin Glyph of Dark Command (http://db.mmo-champion.com/search/all/glyph_of_dark_command/)<br />
<br />
Do that for all the glyphs you want to sell from this alt, go back to your main char and craft them. Next time you will visit the mailbox, click the &quot;Send&quot; tab and all the glyphs will be listed on the right with the name of your alt next to it! Press &quot;send&quot; at the bottom of the list and all your glyphs will be mailed in no time. Of course it works with multiple alts at the same time and you should always craft on your main, mail to alts. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/glyphsend_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/glyphsend.jpg)<br />
<br />
Looting on your alts should be quite fast because of BulkMail2 Inbox (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/bulk-mail2inbox.aspx) but depending on your server/connection quality, there are a few occasions where looting mails will be very slow. The only workaround I found is to use Postal (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/postal.aspx) instead and try again with Bulkmail later. You shouldn't rely on Postal (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/postal.aspx) because for most people, it will bug the send feature of Bulkmail (You can't just run 2 mail mods at the same time and expect everything to work as intended) <br />
<br />
Important: You can only loot 50 items from the Mailbox at a time, then you have to wait a minute or two before you can loot the next 50 items. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/glyphinventory_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/glyphinventory.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
Refilling Glyphs<br />
After a few hours/days of sales, you will need to recraft all the glyphs you sold. Over time you should try to increase your stock of glyphs to always have 20 units of all the glyphs you can create. You could argue that having 20 [insert worthless glyph here] is a waste of money but a 60G sale would be enough to pay for the whole stack, and if it doesnt sell you will never have to craft one again. <br />
<br />
The best way to do that is to cancel all the auctions on your alts (the fees aren't that expensive), loot your mailbox, and go to the Auction House. Then go to the Auctions Tab and click Summary to do a Glyph scan again. The list will look like this :<br />
<br />
Glyph of Sprint (7) 19 3G 75S<br />
<br />
The (7) is the amount of Glyph in your inventory, just double click the name and add 3 glyphs to the queue if you want to refill to 10, and do that for all the glyphs. If you can count up to 20 without too much problem it won't take more than 5 minutes to do it on all your alts, the craft queue is independant from the character and you will just have to move back to your main character to craft all the glyphs for your alts. (And mail them automatically, thanks to Bulkmail)<br />
<br />
<br />
Getting rid of your Snowfall Inks<br />
Yes, I lied to you, even if your Snowfall Ink (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43127/snowfall-ink/) will be enough to pay for your stack of herbs, it might be a problem to get rid of all of them if you start crafting a lot of Glyphs. <br />
<br />
If you really need to sell a lot of them there are a few things to do :<br />
<br />
Create an item group for Snowfall Inks in Quick Auctions and always try to sell them<br />
Craft Runescrolls of Fortitude (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69385/runescroll-of-fortitude/) and sell them, you might get a few more gold out of them<br />
Craft one or two unit of Faces of Doom (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/59498/faces-of-doom/) and Iron-Bound Tome (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/59497/iron-bound-tome/) and always try to sell them at the AH with a Quick Auction item group again<br />
<br />
.... and that's it. No, I didn't forget the Darkmoon Cards, I just don't think the market is worth it anymore. You can do it if Eternal Life (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/35625/eternal-life/) are really cheap on your server but everything you get that doesn't have &quot;Noble&quot; in its name is pretty much worthless and you will end up wasting a lot of time trying to sell your cards. <br />
<br />
Even the Nobles cards aren't as good as they used to be, people can easily find something better in raids and Icecrown Dungeons in 3.3 will probably kill the Darkmoon Cards market, just don't do it. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Carpet Bombing&quot;<br />
If you want to get rid of competitors in a very very aggressive way, you can always try the &quot;carpet bombing&quot; technique. Basically, the goal here is to scare competitors away by selling a lot of glyphs for a very low price (4 or 5 gold, maybe even 3 if you feel confident about your margin). <br />
<br />
You will need to change your Quick Auctions settings slightly to do that, just set your threshold and fallback price to 4G and make sure the Fallback % is set to 100%. You will now post all your glyphs at a flat 4G price, except if there is someone selling them for cheaper. <br />
<br />
Most of the time, competitors will just back off for a few days and wait until you run out of materials but if you have 10 000 inks of the sea in your bank it can be an interesting strategy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't do inscription myself, but can't you shift-click and select the number you wish to buy? It works for converting Conquest badges to Valor to Heroism<br />

<br />
Run your research every day as soon as you can, BOTH of them, minor glyphs sell as much as major glyphs. Buying a lot of Book of Glyph Master sounds tempting but you shouldn't do it for two reasons :<br />

* A lot of people will start buying and reselling them with a 300% margin as soon as this guide hits the front page. <br />
<br />
<br />
Being able to sell more glyphs is always good, in the end you should just decide if Inscription brings enough money to be worth the investment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Latest Glyphs can't be learned by Inscription Research so you have to buy those books...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it requires thought and/or effort to set up... until Boub was kind enough to post strats for everyone. Now all people have to do is copy/paste :)<br />
<br />
Do not mistake my meaning here, since these addons are permissible you are choosing only to harm yourself if you don't use them. I'm just surprised they're still permissible, that's all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dorque</div><div class="date">2009-09-29, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The books really are worth it in the long run, because in a lot of cases those are the glyphs people really want and they'll pay a premium. Just as an example, most of the glyphs for a combat rogue, most of the best glyphs for a ret pally and most of the best glyphs for a resto druid all come from the books.<br />
<br />
As for the rest, it's a very good guide, even if I do mine a little differently than I do yours, it's definitely profitable if you have what it takes to stick with it. Rescanning and buying out all of the lowest-priced glyphs every day can help a lot too if you have the gold to toss at it.<br />
<br />
Are we going to see a Jewelcrafting guide as well, or am I going to have to write that one for you? =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not only can you just queue up all of your crafting rather than making each item seperately, it'll also autobuy whatever you need to complete your current crafting queue - and that includes inks from Jessica Sellers, making it unnecessary to keep a stock of anything but Ink of the Sea.</div></div><hr />

People need glyphs, and usually they need it right away (for raiding or pvping). At level 80, spending 50g on a glyph isn't a big deal, and they just buy it at whatever price listed on the AH. Just be aware that, if many players enter the glyph market due to this guide, you will be disappointed at the returns. The demand will not be driven up due to all the low price glyphs floating around.</div></div><hr />

Not only can you just queue up all of your crafting rather than making each item seperately, it'll also autobuy whatever you need to complete your current crafting queue - and that includes inks from Jessica Sellers, making it unnecessary to keep a stock of anything but Ink of the Sea.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that the API to craft multiple items at the same time was removed from the game years ago. <br />

<br />
Heh, maybe a little. =P It all depends on how much of an investment you want to make.<br />
<br />
And yes, the option to craft multiple items at one time was removed.... but you can still use these addons to build a queue. Every time you finish crafting one item, you just hit &quot;process queue&quot; to continue to the next item. It may not sound that efficient, but it has several advantages:<br />
<br />
First, you can make up your whole queue in advance and then use the &quot;autobuy&quot; function to buy up all of the inks/parchments you need at once, preventing the need to keep large stocks of everything hanging around. All you need is a lot of Ink of the Sea until you're ready to craft, the rest buys itself, including the other inks.<br />
<br />
Second, it allows you to input data from an outside source quickly.... like a spreadsheet. I haven't done this in a while, but when I was really serious, I kept a spreadsheet of all of the glyphs I could craft. When one sold, I marked it down in the spreadsheet (I usually don't ever sell more than 3 of a glyph at a time, after a certain point you're just wasting auction fees) - when all of my sales were done, the spreadsheet reported to me how many of each glyph I needed to recraft to bring my stocks back up. Then, with the spreadsheet on my laptop, I just went through my glyphs and queued each of the ones I needed to recraft up. After that all you need to do is autobuy the materials and hit the button until your new glyphs are made, then relist.<br />
<br />
One other note, it may be worthwhile to buy a guild bank tab or two for your inscription (on your main if you don't have a guild or on an alt if you do) - again, it's expensive, but it'll save a lot of time and effort on character switching.</div></div><hr />

You won't get as many inks out of it, but if mats on your server are high priced (as they are on mine) you can usually nab Goldclover, Tiger Lily and Deadnettle fairly cheap.</div></div><hr />

Next time you try to troll in a news post, I suggest that you do your homework first.</div></div><hr />

Now before everyone starts QQing about ruining the market remember it really won't be that bad. First of all any research learned glyphs won't gain significant competition for a while, secondly everyone trying to level inscription will be buying up low level inks in bulk (yay free money) and third (and probably most importantly) while the glyph market has incredible money making potential not many people will stick with it simply because it can be an absolute pain in the ass until you get your system down.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barelilus</div><div class="date">2009-09-29, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I presently have an inscriptionist, so I do know that anyone who is serious about getting all the researched glyphs in a timely manner should be aware that the CD on research is the 20hrs, not 24. I know that due to the missing 4hrs, this makes it hard to be on every time your research is ready for use, but if you use an addon like Altoholic, it can notify you when you are approaching the window of use. <br />
<br />
I would also like to add that at present, Runescroll of Fortitude is a great use of your snowfall ink if you are looking to make money. The parchments, for each combine, will only run you 2g if you are exalted. I am selling the Runescrolls on Icecrown for 50g/5, which is a profit of 38g before AH cut if you go with 10g/snowfall. I'm not sure how long the 50g price will hold out, but considering that scrolls don't persist through death, you can figure on steady sales of this item.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rambaral</div><div class="date">2009-09-29, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I buy from sellers that might be the only one not selling multiples, even if it's a little more, because then I know it's a player selling, not a &quot;player&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also, if you're in a halfway decent guild, you never have to pay for crafted items or enchants just mats - and even then usually a guildie will sell for far lower than AH prices. Also, find a guildie that's leveling a profession, they'll likely do it for free with their own mats, because a skillup is worth far more to them.<br />

<br />
Lol, well for that guide instead of buying gems on the AH buy them with honor and get friends to cut them. Same thing with enchanting, i gather all my greens from my bank get a friend to DE and enchant my stuff. For meta gems get the raw gem(its cheaper uncut most of the time) and get another friend to cut it. If you dont have any friends then LF JC and Enchanter on trade and pay them 20g and you still save alot of money. AS for flask well i have an alt that does herbs and again i get a friend to make me the flasks and dont have to pay 50g per flasks in AH</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually on a small server where competition is limited you could make a killing on inscription. As long as you server has a few large herb farmers you are in good shape. Figure out the approximate worth of ink of the sea and snowfall ink on your server and establish a threshold price for herbs (formulas here (http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com/2009/09/glyph-industry.html)). If you can consistently find herbs below those threshold prices then you can make money with inscription.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I never use the higher priced herbs on my server. The increased amount of pigment isn't really worth the greatly increased price since things like Icethorn are pretty high demand for raiding consumables. I use mainly Tiger Lilies, since they're cheap and usually well-stocked on the AH. I also pick up Deadnettle and Fire Leaf when I can (they aren't really useful for alchemy, but tend to be more uncommon) but I tend to avoid Goldclover.<br />
<br />
From milling Tiger Lily, I earn back almost exactly what I spent on them just from selling the Snowfall Ink, so the Ink of the Sea I get is pure profit. I could be earning tons of gold just changing Tiger Lilies into inks, but I'm greedy so I go the extra step to make the glyphs too! ;D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idletime</div><div class="date">2009-09-29, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice guide, but let's discuss the competition you will find on most servers and why the prices are in the toilet on most servers. Carpet bombing will work when I want to eliminate anyone applying this guide, because to be a glyph seller you have to have a strong will. If you're getting into inscription because you read about it here, then good luck to you. The majority of Inscription pros have been doing it since patch 3.0, and if we're still here that should tell you that we aren't going anywhere and have the bankrolls to bankrupt any newbie sellers that think there's a gold mine here.<br />
<br />
90%-99% of the glyphs you post will be undercut by others within 1-2 hours of posting. That's a fact. You will need to repost and watch your competition at all hours on high pop servers. There are no-lifers and AH campers out there that are going to have you on their friend's lists and once they see you log off, you'll be getting 100% of those glyphs back in the mail. It's a constant game of leap-frog and will probably drive 95% of you out of it within the first week. Additionally, you won't be competitive with glyphs until you have learned almost every single discoverable glyph. This takes 3 months of daily research to complete and you're going to have heavy competition on every single one you get. <br />
<br />
Undercutting by 10s or more makes no sense. Undercut by 1c. That's it. Never any more than 1c or you're going to destroy the pricing for everyone. Of course, that's if you're interested in good profits. Morons that undercut in larger increments for no reason are people I like to make squirm. I'll gladly take all glyph prices to 50s when I see people doing this repeatedly, and I'll keep it there for a month. Been there, done that, got the in-game hate mails. I don't need the money, I just like the action. It's not real world money and ultimately there's nothing that says this is against the rules to do so.<br />
<br />
With the addition of this guide, I also see Snowfall inks plummeting in value because there will be a glut on the market. Can I ask all of you that choose to do this to please post ALL snowfalls at one time? Don't onesy, twosy them, get them all up there and remember to cancel and repost when they get undercut. I need about 500 of them for a project I'm working on so chop-chop.</div></div><hr />

They just don't sell that fast on my server, unfortunately... and there's always someone waiting to undercut you. I get better value from posting small amounts every time and saving on my auction fees - and my time retrieving each glyph and reposting.</div></div><hr />

It's buggy as hell and requires you to disable auctioneer or else the scan will take an eternity and in worst case you'll get a DC. It also takes stupid amounts of time to post (last time I tried it took about 15 minutes and by that point all of my glyphs were undercut again). It's a lot easier using the auctioneer batch post and undercut by 1% instead. In addition to that you are giving people advice on how to work a dying market. People will only get glyphs 2 or 3 times then they'll stick with them unless there's a huge change in a patch and this affects the prices a lot. Most glyphs are way bellow 10g and are barely worth the time spent crafting them and posting as you will only sell a few every day.<br />

It's easy, on most servers it won't cost you anything to craft them ... Let's say that you buy a stack of Adder's Tongue / Lichbloom / Icethorn for 15 gold, you will get an average of 12 Azure Pigment and 4 Icy Pigment out of each stack. That's 2 x Snowfall Ink and 6 x Ink of the Sea ...<br />
<br />
How do you figure in the 2x Snowfall Ink? 50% chance of Icy Pigment per mill x 4 mills = 2 Icy Pigment, or 1 Snowfall Ink. That's significantly different from what you stated.<br />
Mill data on Inscription blogs has shown that the &quot;1-4x&quot; on Icy Pigment vastly favors the 1x Icy Pigment end of the spectrum. I forget where I originally saw the data, but it was quite conclusive that one should expect nowhere near 2 Snowfall Ink per stack.</div></div><hr />

General rule of thumb for any type of marketing that uses resources is the fact that if the raw mats increase in price, so will the result.<br />

So it doesn't matter if on server x a stack of herb x goes for 10,20 or 30g since the glyphs should in general scale up to the same lvl.</div></div><hr />

Well that is assuming certain goblins on your server aren't reading this same information and stockpiling all the mats on the ah to push mat prices up while they push product prices down. I do know of many goblins on certain servers that could do this type of tactic for a month or more :)<br />

Its a guideline, making a guide without adding some form of numbers would make it extremely hard to express how easy it is to make gold with inscription.<br />
If a stack of Icethorn on your server goes for 40g your glyphs should be worth more as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lark</div><div class="date">2009-09-29, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Selling Glyphs is really hard and will require you to do a lot of research to find the most valua.... No, just kidding, you just sell all of them. Trying to figure out what glyph is worth crafting or not is just a waste of time because the glyph market is always moving and ALL glyphs will sell, no matter how bad they are.Strictly untrue. There are glyphs that you can make and will never sell; I made 3 demonic circle glyphs over two months ago and have listed them every day since then. None have ever sold.<br />
<br />
It doesn't really matter when you're listing hundreds a day but if you're breaking into the market you should do a scan and not make stuff selling for sub 4g. Some glyphs are just awful and no one will ever want them.<br />
<br />
Best tip I can add to what you said is the following; figure out when people raid on your server (different for every server, usually between 6-8 local time) and list glyphs with a 12 hour auction at around then every day. Simple, easy, usually makes me 100-1000g a day for very little hassle. Takes about 20 minutes a day.<br />
<br />
Never ever list glyphs with 24 or 48 hour auctions. It's true. The market moves. Also never ever bother to perform huge undercuts. Does nothing. People who list glyphs do so with addons and pay no attention whatsoever to the prices. You can't &quot;Drive&quot; someone out of a market that costs nothing to maintain stock in. 15 copper to list a glyph isn't enough to bother even looking at my screen.</div></div><hr />

There are those on every server. Myself I made that same glyph and sold 2 of them yesterday for about 20g each. I have a Frostbolt glyph I made ages ago that's just sitting there. By and large though you can make almost every glyph in your arsenal and it will eventually sell. At a 30c list price it's not a big hassle as long as you have something like auctioneer or something.<br />
<br />
Another thing you'll want is some sort of tradeskill mod that plugs into auctioneer to tell you the current going prices of whatever you're crafting. Until you know what sells and what doesn't, you can just go through that and just make glyphs that are selling for a least 'X' amount of gold for your profit margin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sure, you might say that that is &quot;slow&quot; gains for some people, but thats still 38k profit in a reasonable amount of time (2 months is a game card, so that really shouldnt be considered a long time in terms of wow) from a method that you deem as dead.<br />
<br />
maybe you dont make alto of gold from it, because you try to buy all the mats for 50 or so cards at the same time, instead of buying eternal lifes and herbs over a period of a few weeks in order to buy for the lowest price possible (i have not paid over 16g for a single eternal life, or over 20g for a stack of adders tongue or icethorn).<br />
<br />
i send all the cheap mats to an alt with a guild bank, and a few days before the faire, i make over 100 cards.<br />
<br />
and also, make sure you trade excess cards for ones you do not have!!! do not sell the excess cards in order to buy mats for to make more cards.<br />
<br />
making decks is still extremely profitable.<br />
<br />
with nobles decks at 4-4.5k on my server, and undeath decks at 900-1.5k.<br />

<br />
you can buy stackable items by shift clicking them(doesn't work for items that are bought in stacks like symbol of kings or water). for example, you can shift click an ink from the trader and you can type 20 to buy a stack(you can only buy one stack at at time). at the very least you don't have to click something 500 times.<br />
<br />
when waiting for mail when you're past the 50 item limit, simply reloading your ui will make the mail appear(/console reloadui). also useful when you get any glitches too.</div></div><hr />

The bulk mail you receive back is a real problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure why bulk mail is a problem. Is it all of the expired auctions and you have to open each mail and remove the item? There are macros to automate this. For example...<br />
<br />
/script CheckInbox() for m = GetInboxNumItems(), 1, -1 do TakeInboxItem( m ) end</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you only post 1 or 2 at a time, yours will sell and then they will sell some too. If you post 10 at a time, then 10 have to sell before your competition gets any sells. This caps them out of the market. Not only did you drive the price down, you also prevent them from posting behind you.<br />
<br />
Also know when to walk away from the market. on some servers there is no profit in glyphs. thats why it is known as a worthless profession. I expect some people will get a good day the first day and think they can make good gold at it. Days are hit and miss. <br />
<br />
You need lots of time to do this too. To make 10 of all 300 glyphs would take you 2.5 hours of milling and 2 hours of crafting. (takes 3 sec to mill and 2.5 sec to make a glyph).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are probably milling ALL herbs. Don't.<br />
<br />
ONLY mill Lichbloom / Icethorn / Adders tongue. Go check the mill stats on wowhead; these produce far more mats.<br />
<br />
The numbers you quoted are about right if you are milling other things too. They are a waste of mill. Sell those herbs on AH and buy good milling herbs.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it's fantastic money, IF there's not a huge number of people on your server doing it. But since a lot will blindly follow the 10s undercut suggested here, expect to see prices plunge very rapidly. I actually use a 1s undercut, which is fine with not that many people in the market, but if there's going to be a lot I'll likely shift to 1c instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trying to figure out what glyph is worth crafting or not is just a waste of time because the glyph market is always moving and ALL glyphs will sell, no matter how bad they are.<br />
<br />
As others have said, disagree with this. Sure, you can just list all if you want, but some glyphs will NOT sell, no matter how many times you try. And if you're using a minimum price threshold, those glyphs will forever sit in your bags not even reaching the AH, because they're permanently listed for well under your threshold price. You can either list everything and not have a threshold price, or have a threshold price and be selective with what you craft, but you can't have a threshold price and keep stocks of everything unless you happen to like wasting large amounts of bankspace on things that will never even see an auction. Every now and then I drop my threshold to 90s to try and clear out some of the junk, and even then most of them won't sell. <br />
<br />
My personal solution is craft any listed at 10g+ (dropped that to 8g+ the last few days since prices dropped a lot... suspecting I'll have to lower it further in the coming days), and just check each day, adding any new ones that have appeared in that priceband. You'll get the occasional one that just spiked as a one-off and never actually sells for that price, but it's a good space saver overall, since you'll generally end up with covering all those which are safe to make a good profit, and not having too many of those that will never sell. I do all my trading with the crafter character rather than a banker though, people who want to take it more seriously and use a banker alt might prefer to just spam every type of glyph anyway.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who previously has had the will to make money will go out and find a way to do it. You can go to elitistjerks, mmowned, etc. There are tons of guides out there on how to do it. But none of them will work.<br />
<br />
I've hit the gold cap twice now, mostly with jewelcrafting/enchanting/inscriptions.<br />
<br />
The reason this &quot;guide&quot; won't work is that the people who invented this guide already dominated the market.<br />
<br />
If you want to actually get rich quick, you must understand the concepts that drive this guide so that you can create your own &quot;manipulations.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first post that this guy made is simply no longer profitable. Any &quot;craft and disenchant&quot; scheme has probably already been driven into the ground. The people (like me) who come up with those schemes do so at the start of every expansion, before the secrets are public. As soon as the secrets are public, they no longer work.<br />
<br />
If you want to make money, you need to know how to quickly identify market opportunities and then exhaust them. Glyphs have been exhausted.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's why this guide won't change the inscription market and really won't work for anyone...<br />
- Glyphs have high barrier of entry. Lower level herbs are not cheap, especially in the ~30-40 range. It's a pretty expensive profession to level. On top of that, you would have to wait 80 days - roughly 3 months - before you had all of the glyphs learned through research. And then there are books of glyph mastery, which cost 100g each or so. Inscriptions really only makes money as quick as it does by the sheer massive number of glyphs out there. If you only have 25% of the &quot;money making&quot; glyphs, you'll only see 25% of the profits. That 1000g comes down to 250g for a hell of a lot of work. You will need to dump an entry-level 10k gold if you want to make any noticable profit with glyphs.<br />
- The pros already know how to weed out the n00bs. I have a friends list with all the other glyph bank alts out there. Every time one logs off, I log on. It's very easy to destroy the competition without needing to drop prices. There are several other ways that I'm not going to delve into.<br />
- People lose interest. If you want to actually dominate the glyph market, you have to be able to do things that the average WoW player cannot do. You need to be able to log on during raid hours to undercut all the raiders. You need to be able to log on at lunch to get the kids coming home from school. You have to hit every major glyph consumer group. Most people can't do that. If you can't log on WoW when the servers come back up on a Tuesday, you simply will not make as much of a profit. The pros know when glyphs sell the most and know when to get aggressive. If you can't meet that, you won't see money.<br />
- The pros already have 100k+ gold. You're not going to bankrupt them. I sit at a constant 200k gold on my main. Any time I dip below, I transfer more from bank alts. No matter what anyone does, you're not going to bankrupt me with glyphs. There simply are not enough herbs getting gathered per hour for you to bankrupt any pro in this expansion.<br />
- The glyph market is already dead. Yes, you see a lot of money. But you don't see much profit-per-hour. At the end of the day, what matters is how much gold you made versus how much time you spent in front of the computer. I've got 4 chars with most (if not all) glyphs in the game on 4 separate servers. Each could make more money-per-hour through herbalism or jewelcrafting at this point, or even just running dailies. I make probably 150g per hour sitting in front of the computer. I know that I could make more in other venues.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Want to know what this guide does to people like me? Who have 200k+ gold already?<br />
<br />
This guide makes me think &quot;hmmm, how do I turn a profit off of the mmo-champion guide?&quot;<br />
<br />
I already made around ~22k selling old world enchanting mats. As soon as the first guide was posted, I bought all old-world enchanting mats and reposted them at about ~200% of their original posting. ALL of them sold. I just bought out all old world herbs too, and am reposting them again at 220%. I'm going to bet all of them will sell.<br />

If you want to make a real &quot;guide,&quot; you need to teach people the concepts. Any &quot;money making guide&quot; you read about on the internet probably is about some opportunity that has already been exhausted. New opportunities are found every day. This guide isn't going to &quot;redistribute the wealth,&quot; it's just going to create new opportunities for the rich people to grab at.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greenn</div><div class="date">2009-09-30, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's why this guide won't change the inscription market and really won't work for anyone...<br />
- Glyphs have high barrier of entry. Lower level herbs are not cheap, especially in the ~30-40 range. It's a pretty expensive profession to level. On top of that, you would have to wait 80 days - roughly 3 months - before you had all of the glyphs learned through research. And then there are books of glyph mastery, which cost 100g each or so. Inscriptions really only makes money as quick as it does by the sheer massive number of glyphs out there. If you only have 25% of the &quot;money making&quot; glyphs, you'll only see 25% of the profits. That 1000g comes down to 250g for a hell of a lot of work. You will need to dump an entry-level 10k gold if you want to make any noticable profit with glyphs.<br />
<br />
inscription is actually the cheapest profession to level, all you have to do is buy northrend herbs for 15-30g a stack(depending on your server) and have a friend mill all of the herbs(you need about 1200 herbs) and turn them into ink of the sea and turn them into the low level inks you need<br />
<br />
after you do all of that sell all of the snowfall ink you got and it cost hardly any gold. iv leveled inscription 1-400 on 5 characters for 500g each, after i sold all of the snowfall ink i got.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CaesarRex</div><div class="date">2009-09-30, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not like any of this guide is a secret. Anyone who previously has had the will to make money will go out and find a way to do it. You can go to elitistjerks, mmowned, etc. There are tons of guides out there on how to do it. But none of them will work.<br />
<br />
I've hit the gold cap twice now, mostly with jewelcrafting/enchanting/inscriptions.<br />
<br />
The reason this &quot;guide&quot; won't work is that the people who invented this guide already dominated the market.<br />
<br />
If you want to actually get rich quick, you must understand the concepts that drive this guide so that you can create your own &quot;manipulations.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first post that this guy made is simply no longer profitable. Any &quot;craft and disenchant&quot; scheme has probably already been driven into the ground. The people (like me) who come up with those schemes do so at the start of every expansion, before the secrets are public. As soon as the secrets are public, they no longer work.<br />
<br />
If you want to make money, you need to know how to quickly identify market opportunities and then exhaust them. Glyphs have been exhausted.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's why this guide won't change the inscription market and really won't work for anyone...<br />
- Glyphs have high barrier of entry. Lower level herbs are not cheap, especially in the ~30-40 range. It's a pretty expensive profession to level. On top of that, you would have to wait 80 days - roughly 3 months - before you had all of the glyphs learned through research. And then there are books of glyph mastery, which cost 100g each or so. Inscriptions really only makes money as quick as it does by the sheer massive number of glyphs out there. If you only have 25% of the &quot;money making&quot; glyphs, you'll only see 25% of the profits. That 1000g comes down to 250g for a hell of a lot of work. You will need to dump an entry-level 10k gold if you want to make any noticable profit with glyphs.<br />
- The pros already know how to weed out the n00bs. I have a friends list with all the other glyph bank alts out there. Every time one logs off, I log on. It's very easy to destroy the competition without needing to drop prices. There are several other ways that I'm not going to delve into.<br />
- People lose interest. If you want to actually dominate the glyph market, you have to be able to do things that the average WoW player cannot do. You need to be able to log on during raid hours to undercut all the raiders. You need to be able to log on at lunch to get the kids coming home from school. You have to hit every major glyph consumer group. Most people can't do that. If you can't log on WoW when the servers come back up on a Tuesday, you simply will not make as much of a profit. The pros know when glyphs sell the most and know when to get aggressive. If you can't meet that, you won't see money.<br />
- The pros already have 100k+ gold. You're not going to bankrupt them. I sit at a constant 200k gold on my main. Any time I dip below, I transfer more from bank alts. No matter what anyone does, you're not going to bankrupt me with glyphs. There simply are not enough herbs getting gathered per hour for you to bankrupt any pro in this expansion.<br />
- The glyph market is already dead. Yes, you see a lot of money. But you don't see much profit-per-hour. At the end of the day, what matters is how much gold you made versus how much time you spent in front of the computer. I've got 4 chars with most (if not all) glyphs in the game on 4 separate servers. Each could make more money-per-hour through herbalism or jewelcrafting at this point, or even just running dailies. I make probably 150g per hour sitting in front of the computer. I know that I could make more in other venues.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Want to know what this guide does to people like me? Who have 200k+ gold already?<br />
<br />
This guide makes me think &quot;hmmm, how do I turn a profit off of the mmo-champion guide?&quot;<br />
<br />
I already made around ~22k selling old world enchanting mats. As soon as the first guide was posted, I bought all old-world enchanting mats and reposted them at about ~200% of their original posting. ALL of them sold. I just bought out all old world herbs too, and am reposting them again at 220%. I'm going to bet all of them will sell.<br />
<br />

For example, holding onto your early glyphs because you'll need them later. People on this site bitched about how I said this game was hard. Hard? No. Unexplained, mindless, directionless bullshit, yes. You need a guide because well, the game does a half ass job of providing any real information.<br />
<br />
All this sounds like to me is an attempt to get everyone to roll an otherwise worthless profession so Blizz. can keep the WoW crack fueling through your veins. Remember this, if everyone does decide to re-roll Inscription, for whatever your reasons, I guarantee it gets nerfed into the dirt. We can't have everyone rolling the same profession now can we? That would be OP...</div></div><hr />

<br />
- So I can buy anything I ever want in the game at the moment I want it. Got a new alt that needs epic flying? Easy. Need to switch professions for PvP? Done. <br />
- So my friends and guildmates never need to worry about repairs or flasks or food again.<br />
- So I bribe people who outroll me in Vault of Archavon (or whereever) to trade me a piece of gear for a ridiculous amount of money.<br />
- So I can say I have.</div></div><hr />

shift+click...<br />
<br />
Selling Glyphs is really hard and will require you to do a lot of research to find the most valua.... No, just kidding, you just sell all of them.<br />
You are wrong.<br />
Pay the people to do the research for you, and study the market with the beancounter. You did a guide with no idea about how to do it properly. Anyway it is going to be very useful for people who is starting with this.<br />
<br />
I used to buy ink of the sea for 25gs and know is around 100g in zuljin horde... I loved you man, now I hate you xD.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pokchop</div><div class="date">2009-09-30, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL! Just like the last guide. You must be on one lucky server! All herbs on my server go for 50g a stack. :(<br />
<br />
However, selling glyphs that use low level mats seem to be a nice profit maker. But that's it. And demand is low for glyphs since the prime gouging time (i.e. at expac release) has already passed. Most people already have all the glyphs they need.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Glyphs have high barrier of entry. Lower level herbs are not cheap, especially in the ~30-40 range. It's a pretty expensive profession to level. On top of that, you would have to wait 80 days - roughly 3 months - before you had all of the glyphs learned through research. And then there are books of glyph mastery, which cost 100g each or so.

You will need to dump an entry-level 10k gold if you want to make any noticable profit with glyphs.<br />
<br />
For me personally, I made my DK a herb alt (like all the others), and all the herbs I got leveling the DK's herblism was enough to power level my main's inscription to almost max (damn you Northrend research!) So I basically leveled two professions for the price of one.<br />
<br />
Inscription is probably one of the easiest professions to level, because it doesn't give a crap what herbs you pick. Unlike alchemy where you might hit a speed bump because you don't have X amount of some rare herb. And don't you just hate it when you're farming and none of that herb you need NEVER spawn? My face is like :'(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The reason to have this much gold? And I mean several hundred thousand? Simple. If I play on a decent server I can buy and sell the big guilds and not have to invest the time 4-5 days a week, 3-5 hours a day. I want a 310 proto? Name the price. I want gear from arenas? Can you dance with me and carry me? I play less than 7-8 hours a week anymore, but I ride around on the fastest mount and wear the best gear available from Arenas and Hard Mode PvE content. Once TOC is on farm for most guilds I'll also have the best weapons in the game. And I didn't have to spend real world currency to buy my gold, I earned it off the backs of those that do dailies for their income by spending 10-15 minutes a day at the AH. I would say that's a fair trade.<br />
<br />
It's kinda like being the team owner of a professional sports franchise. I made my money outsmarting the competition, I bought in and never played a day of my life. But I get all the glory that everyone else worked weeks and hours upon hours to perfect. You'd be surprised how much more fun the game is when you have the bankroll to make top end guilds help you get there.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I don't care if I suck, I'm just another 14.95 a month peon like everyone else, just getting the bang for the buck.<br />
<br />
Now go do your dailies. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

But that could just be me. Trust me, its just as much enjoying to earn that special 310% mount by working for it by perfecting it.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mutantboy</div><div class="date">2009-09-30, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I just looked at this guide and compared it to server prices. How depressing. Stacks of herb for 40g - Scrips for 2g<br />
And lots and lots of scrips. All the common ones are so cheap I couldn't see any margin there at all. <br />
<br />
On the other hand I'm looking at the dust prices compared to Leather and salivating. <br />

I'm gonna keep yesterdays page and stop reading right there. <br />

<br />
I have more than 400k gold and in the last few days I have been wiping all herbs on AH and Trade Channel.<br />
<br />
I want flask price to go up because the lack of herbs. It is not hard. I have so much gold, I can buy hundreds of stacks of herbs without having to fear anything.<br />
<br />
When we have so much gold in bank, it's not about making gold anymore. It's about controlling and cornering the market. Make other players pay.</div></div><hr />

It's a simple matter of economics and the social ladder. I have a full time job that requires 48-60 hours of my time , I play 7-8 hours a week. I get what I want, the guilds that supply me get oodles of gold to do with as they please. Fair trade. In the time you spent wiping to learn Yogg 0 or 1, I spent that out with friends, family and dates. I get my stuff a few weeks later, sure, so what. I don't care about firsts, that's nerd stuff.

I have already made 32k. I bought out all the leather and cobalt yesterday and more than tripled their costs. Another 20k. Tell the bads to stay away from the ah and stick to their dailies. They seem to listen to you for some reason.<br />
<br />
This guide is only hurting those without money to begin with and increasing the wealth of those who already had taken the time to make the money. Can't wait for the next one, I always wanted to make 200k in less than a week, haven't been able to do that since inscription launched.</div></div><hr />

And I'll modify the part about the books, I guess my line sounded a bit pessimistic :p<br />

<br />
Im not sure if anything ese have been said about this but.<br />
<br />
Advanced tradeskill window makes it possible to que all of the glyphs that you wanna make and after each set of glyphs is done you can &quot;proceed&quot; with next glyphset.<br />
<br />
Also with advance tradeskill window you can set up you own lists with only the glyphs that you wanna make or have the slightest chance to get sold since 50% of the glyphs in the game is impossible to sell at all, just set up a list with good selling glyphs and never have to worry again about unsold made glyphs.<br />
<br />
As also said in previous post, when you have done your wole glyphque go to supply seller and press buy regent, all needed regents you will need for your que gets bought in 1 click.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blaugrana1899</div><div class="date">2009-09-30, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm not quite sure what to think of the guide... i have an inscriptionist who can make all glyphs (yes, i bought a gazillion books of glyph mastery with the money i made with JC). i have tried to make money out of this profession and it's possible but very annoying and really not worth it, if you can just level a jewelcrafter. <br />
<br />
1. it's very time consuming. just crafting the glyphs is a major pain in the ass... keeping track of the diferent inks you need aswell as the parchments can also be pretty annoying, even with the help of addons and jessica sellers (the ink NPC).<br />
2. it uses up too much bank/bag space. i know you already mentioned that in your guide... but it's just too much and can get really confusing (4 alts just for selling glyphs? waaaaaaahh!).<br />
3. the demand is limited. you depend completely on people respeccing/getting dualspec or leveling alts to sell your stuff. on a low population server that can become a problem (at least it is on my server), since even good glyphs might not sell so good. of course you will get them sold some day and make a really good profit eventually... but you don't have this problem with jewelcrafting (or enchanting, i guess), where almost every new item dropping will make some guy go to the AH to buy jewels or enchants.<br />
<br />
aside from these practical reasons, on my server herb prices a really too high (even before the release of this guide ;D).<br />
<br />
personally, i only sell glyphs after a patch (when glyphs or specs get changed enough, to suddenly make people want new glyphs). of course i will never ever get the cost of all the books of glyph mastery back, just by selling the glyphs i learned from them... but since that was never my intention (had to &quot;complete my collection&quot;) and i still have my jewelcrafter to really make money... i don't really care. :)<br />
<br />
also: to all you QQers about how boubouille is screwing the economy and whatnot... everything will straighten out in a few days or weeks. nothing to worry about, imho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How do you &quot;single handedly&quot; ruin the economy? Just because prices of certain mats went up doesn't mean any economy is ruined. Are those prices higher than what you're willing to pay? Then don't buy it. That's how the economy works. Boub's guide making mats prices skyrocket? Sell those mats instead. The money isn't going to a black hole, SOMEONE is ALWAYS getting paid (isn't this obvious??). So I disagree. The economy is fine, unless all you can do is sell one thing only. Then you're pretty much fucked until you to diversify.<br />
<br />
The guide may or may not be helpful, that part I'm not disputing. I just think it's hilarious some people are so angry over a change in the WoW economy. Those who know how to make money always will. Those THINK they know how to make money, because up until now they've been putting all their eggs in one basket, well... cry here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a simple matter of economics and the social ladder. I have a full time job that requires 48-60 hours of my time , I play 7-8 hours a week. I get what I want, the guilds that supply me get oodles of gold to do with as they please. Fair trade. In the time you spent wiping to learn Yogg 0 or 1, I spent that out with friends, family and dates. I get my stuff a few weeks later, sure, so what. I don't care about firsts, that's nerd stuff. Think I talk about this game with colleagues that would give a shit?<br />
My question wasn't regarding the amount of time you invest comparitively. I specifically asked what you do AFTER you've bought all your top of the line stuff. People get raiding gear so they can compete in raids. People get arena gear so they can compete in arena. Titles/mounts are merely objectives on the side. <br />
<br />
So now you've got a Gladiator title and all of your Relentless gear and your Furious Wyrm. You've got a full kit of T9 and a Grand Crusader title. What do you do with those 7-8 hours you're logged in each week? Do you just stand around in Dalaran and wait for the next patch to arrive so you can senselessly spend money and repeat the entire cycle? Please don't interpret this as flaming, it's a genuine question. <br />
<br />
To me, and I'm sure several other thousand/million players, the only reason to continue playing the game is to experience and complete the challenges the game has to offer. The only reason we're gearing up in the Coliseum is so we can actively progress through the challenges in Icecrown. What's your reason for collecting the gear?<br />
<br />
I find it bizarre that so many people who play this game seem to think that the fact that they have jobs and families/girlfriends makes them some kind of rare exception in the world, and seem hellbent on making a point of it.</div></div><hr />

I've had inscription ever since it was introduced and the only time i really was able to sell a lot of glyphs is at the times new glyphs are introduced.<br />
<br />
Too bad the time is gone for now when you we're the only on a server with a certain glyph. I think i made about 20k gold just from Glyph of Life Tap at some point, but i also invisted about 15k in Books of Glyph mastery at that point. Still made that back easily when glyphs we're still rare.<br />
<br />
At the moment since i'm on a relatively low population server on horde side, while alliance has the majority of the server. So my potentional market is really small and i know plenty of people who haven't swapped glyphs in months. Personally i just use my inscription atm to make glyphs for myself, since i still end up respeccing 2-3 times a week (Yes even with dual spec) and swapping glyphs accordingly.</div></div><hr />

I wondered that myself. My faction is outnumbered in the server I play in so it could explain it, but after trying to sell glyphs I realized that while they definitely sell they do it very slowly. While I could make a large variety of glyphs and use alts to sell them, it would take a lot of time and effort for not so much benefit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
exactly. and i'm not even sure if the situation is really that much diferent on high population servers. of course these servers have more people respeccing every day... but they also have more people getting new items. i think jewelcrafting or enchanting is a better alternative, no matter what server you play on.<br />
<br />
inscriptionists who don't plan on leveling a jewelcrafter/enchanter, might still find this guide useful, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This limit is pretty annoying indeed. The best way to handle it is doing a /rl in between every fifty mails. With a fast computer and a separate trading account/WoW setup with minimum overhead it takes about two seconds. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A lot of people will start buying and reselling them with a 300% margin as soon as this guide hits the front page.<br />
<br />
This is rather presumptuous. Again, these trading &quot;strategies&quot; are mainstream and well documented. This is already happening on nearly every server. The guide focuses on realising the margin between raw materials and finished products which most players are too lazy or undisciplined to exploit in a structured and efficient way. The challenge of using these opportunities is not finding them, it is usually to streamline the work process and logistics required so it takes the least time possible to maximise gold/hour. This is probably how the guide will be useful to many players, not enlightening them about the margins on these items but rather how mods like QA2 and BulkMail2 can be used to automate a work process that would otherwise be too tedious to stay profitable and manageable.</div></div><hr />

Simple. But so many of you can't look past your little microcosms. You think you're so smart for figuring out one simple strategy to make gold and then start crying and screaming when something threatens to overturn it, instead of looking for the next opportunity.<br />

Why is it so profitable to sell Glyphs? It's easy, on most servers it won't cost you anything to craft them ... Let's say that you buy a stack of Adder's Tongue (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36903/adders-tongue/) / Lichbloom (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36905/lichbloom/) / Icethorn (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36906/icethorn/) for 15 gold, you will get an average of 12 Azure Pigment (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/39343/azure-pigment/) and 4 Icy Pigment (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43109/icy-pigment/) out of each stack. That's 2 x Snowfall Ink (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43127/snowfall-ink/) and 6 x Ink of the Sea (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43126/ink-of-the-sea/) ... <br />
<br />
<br />
Four icy pigments on average per stack? er... that'd be one per milling... either that's a serious typo or you're the luckiest miller ever or I'm the unluckiest ever, but even though I've done some serious milling at time, I've never been anywhere close to that kind of number.<br />

<br />
No matter how many people are making glyphs, there is a soft cap and an absolute limit on the number of herbs available. No matter how many people are buying, the supply will not increase significantly as there are only a set number of herbalists at any time harvesting and selling resources. Even if the number of herbalists increases somewhat due to the price increase, there is also a limit on the rate that herbs spawn. In the long run, supply will go down and prices will rise, yes. That's GOOD for us.<br />
<br />
If herb prices do indeed rise, this will drive about half of the new players out of the profession entirely. The others will struggle to make a profit and rapidly bankrupt themselves. With a lower supply of herbs, those of us who already have a bankroll will be able to control the market on rare glyphs even better than we can now. Less herbs spread around means more profit for us.<br />

I'm already frustrated, on my server there are some ah-nolifers who uses this strategy. Fortunatly for me they dont have that many glyphs to sell, maybe just about 100. But they are really quick, maybe 30 mins after ive posted my glyphs they will have undercut me on all their glyphs. Its quite funny, especially when you force them to a really low price level and then just cancel youre auctions and buyout theirs... but they didnt give up the first, second or third time i did it ;)</div></div><hr />

I do this a lot when people try to get in on a market im in. Instead of just buying them out for the first reduced price they put it up at i list a few even cheaper. Until they are down a lot from what they started at, then i buy them out.</div></div><hr />

Because of Skyrocketing Herb prices, It will also make it a right pain in the ass for alchemists now, who suffer collateral damage.<br />
<br />
And frankly, Glyphs have very, very low demand except for specific ones. Unless new Glyphs get released, people at msot buy 2 sets and are set for months. <br />

This guide requires a High Poulation Server. There is simply no other way any of these conditions can occur otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
People have been banned for economic exploitation, which is very different from what we're doing here.<br />
<br />
The prime example of a ban due to working the AH is when several players pooled their gold, bought out the entire Auction House and relisted it at vastly inflated prices.<br />
<br />
We're working on a much more limited scale, buying and selling, working only on our own schedules and with our own gold. It's a lot different and shouldn't be actionable by a GM. I can't guarantee it won't happen, but the likelihood is very slim.<br />
<br />
::EDIT::<br />
<br />
If it helps, view it the same was as the US Fair Trade laws. Playing the free market is fine. Using your bankroll to create severe inflation or a monopoly situation by exploitation and/or collusion is not fine.</div></div><hr />

And before ppl say this is known for a long time, a clue would be that QA has doubled it's number of DL's in less then 2 days(from 11 to 22k ), go figure ::)<br />
<br />
<br />
WOW! A whole 22,000?!<br />
Lets put this into perspective. Lets say 10m people play WoW. And lets say theres 500 servers. Thats 20,000 players per server. 22,000 players have QA, divided by 500 servers thats 44 players per server using it. S**t, a whole 0.2% of the playerbase using QA per server. Thats 2 people with JC/Insc/Ench/LW+BS. So you're controlling 50% of the market from each profession. <br />
Also these noobs trying to start up (as a poster said earlier) they aren't going to start with all the recipes and aren't going to have hardly any gold to invest in the market. <br />
People need to get a grip, so what there will be an extra 1 or 2 real competitors, in a market you've been monopolising since the launch.</div></div><hr />

Same with Borean leather from the first guide, I don't know exactly what it was before as I don't have a LW but my Auctioneer is showing it at 347% now. It is already having a knock on effect on flasks which were already at inflated prices due to frost lotus, but now it is much more profitable at currenct 200-300% prices for an alchemist to sell the herbs than make the flasks, even if he gets extra procs, this increasing the running prices of any guild that raids and uses 3-4 flasks per person per night.<br />
<br />
This inscription guide is exactly what I was already doing, because I'm not an idiot, I have at least half a brain and can figure out how to buy and sell to make a bit of cash.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the people out there with less than half a brain have gone a bit crazy on it so I'm going to have to step away from the AH for a while until people forget or get bored and it goes back to normal, which it will eventually.<br />
<br />
It's a shame that such a well written guide only benefits the idiots who didn't use their brains to figure out how to make gold in the first place, and will only serve to hurt the people who have been working on the economy for months or years and the regular joes who now have no clue why all the auction house prices have gone crazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a simple matter of economics and the social ladder. I have a full time job that requires 48-60 hours of my time , I play 7-8 hours a week. I get what I want, the guilds that supply me get oodles of gold to do with as they please. Fair trade. In the time you spent wiping to learn Yogg 0 or 1, I spent that out with friends, family and dates. I get my stuff a few weeks later, sure, so what. I don't care about firsts, that's nerd stuff. Think I talk about this game with colleagues that would give a shit?<br />
<br />
<br />
For someone who registered on the forums on the first day of this series, and has only responded to these with scare tactics and bragging, I have to call you out on this in a couple factors. And yes, I know I just registered before I responded, but I couldn't let such arrogance go unquestioned.<br />
<br />
1. Like you said, &quot;Think I talk about this game with colleagues that would give a shit?&quot; Well, that's all fine and dandy, but why are you here bragging about your supposed empire? You think WE care that you can make X gold in just 7-8 hours a week? I know I certainly don't, and I am sure a lot of other people don't care either, since you can't be on every server at once, especially with your own limited time as per your statement. That means, chances are, we will never run into you. Even if you happen to be on the server one of us is on, I seriously doubt we will care.<br />
<br />
2. Just like in the real life, your virtual pixel gold means nothing, out here in the internet, your real life means nothing. You could be married to a super model with genius kids living the life of Hugh Hefner, and most of us wouldn't care. And NONE of us would believe you. Therein lies the crux. You can claim anything you want RL, but there is absolutely no way to prove it. So don't do it. It just makes it look like you are compensating for something.<br />
<br />
3. Like your real life, you have no proof of your virtual empire. You can show screen shots galore, but without anything to verify them with, and I mean something that can't be photoshopped, notepad edited, or even just plain slight-of-handed, it's all a bunch of talk. Even if you did somehow prove that you had this mountain of gold, good luck proving you didn't just pay some chinese farmer to get it for you.<br />
<br />
4. Like another poster asked, if all you do is just run around with your bought epics and bought mount, what's so great? Is paying $15 a month worth it to stroke some epeen that will never really get you anything? Hell, even the people into the &quot;nerd stuff&quot; will not care about what you have. Hell, I bet anyone on your server (if you even exist in the way you portray) who sees you just says to themselves, &quot;Oh look, someone ebayed for their account, more money then brains.&quot;<br />
<br />
5. If you are in it for the control of the &quot;nerds&quot; then you really are getting the worst end of this bargain. I won't bother explaining it to you, because since you aren't into &quot;nerd stuff&quot; you wouldn't get it, but we are all laughing at you.<br />
<br />
6. I notice every single one of your responses is trying to scare people away from following these guides, or &quot;joining the cartel&quot; with your &quot;don't undercut me or I will bury you&quot; attitude. Sounds to me like you are pissed off that someone is educating your competition, and are trying frantically to scare them off and those they might educate before they start cutting into your precious profit margin.<br />
<br />
Maybe when you were a kid, you had some nerd make you look stupid, and now you want to control all the nerds like little puppets. Maybe you are some financial genius and have discovered the best way to make money in a virtual world. In the end, you come across as some anonymous nobody who is trying to make themselves look like the king of the world. You came to the wrong place. None of us care, and most of us probably don't believe you. And purple pixels don't impress me, especially when they were bought and not earned. You are just like the guy in the Rolls Royce who got the money by buying and selling things he never touched/worked on/built, has no sense of what really matters. After all, years down the road, when you finally die, what will all of this matter?</div></div><hr />

The hours of milling herbs. The hours of converting pigments to inks. The time spent deciding how many to make of each type. How the first 200 glyphs types you learn rarely make you real money. The learning curves for using the addons. The boredom of creating hundreds of pieces of jewelry/armor/weapons and the effort and time it takes to d/e them. Most people who are serious about making proffesion make money for them regularly spend a good few hours sat doing mundane repetative tasks to achive this.<br />
<br />
My main problem with the guide is going to be the rampant use of QA, blindly undercutting without any forethough or reasoning and without any kind of price resetting will drive most glyphs prices down to roughly the same as the mats cost. Hopefully it wont get to the point where the time investment outweighs the virtual financial gain.<br />
<br />
My only hope is that this is a minor bump in the road as people will tire of the &quot;work&quot; aspect of proffesions.</div></div><hr />

The way I see it is this: using these methods takes a lot of time and resources. My gut feeling is that although the market may be *slightly* shafted right now, the people who've just gone &quot;OOOH SHINY GOLDZ QUICK QUICK CHOP CHOP NAO!&quot; won't have the patience or staying power for the long term, and will drop off in a few weeks.

For start i would like to point out that im making tons of money by simply logging in and staring at the Auction House window for few minutes waiting for it to give up to my natural awsomness and through the law of infinite impropability send me couple million gold to my mailbox.<br />
<br />
Second, for my gold i was able to force every person from Ensidia and Starts to wear my designer T-shirts on a press confrences therefore giving me lots of publicty, fame and sex with supermodels with big... eyes.<br />
<br />
After that with gold i was able to not only buy a guild to run me through instance, i bough every instance in my server ensuring that noone walks in and using them to store my private harem of pixelized characters for my own amusement.<br />
<br />
And that is not all, dont even get me started about arenas and PvP. For start im paying every horde character a sum of 1000 gold per each honorable kill i make. Sometimes they might be even enclined to help me by throwing themselves off cliffs and tall buildings. And as for arena's? Well i paid every possible team to roll over and die as soon as they see me.<br />
<br />
After doing all this i realised i alienated everyone that ever liked me, but hey. I can buy new friends am i right?<br />
And who cares if im quadrupal amputee unable to get into the guild because pressing buttons in orders requires higher cerebral functions? I have lots of e-gold and thats what matters!<br />
<br />
PS: Oh im also the CEO of some big multinational company that name accidently i forgot..<br />
<br />
PPS: Im like rich and beautifull. No realy.<br />
<br />
PPPS: I play for like half an hour a game. Other time i spent on the gym working my unreasonably large muscles.<br />

This article seems to have been the genesis for a spike in plants and inks, both of which I sell. I sold my entire inventory (~220 stacks) of ink last night at 30-40% over normal value... my plant bank is almost empty and would have been if I didn't have to work this morning. The prices for raw materials skyrocketed. Goldclover, for example, which typically sells for 25-28g per stack was bid up to 40-45g per stack.<br />
<br />
After seeing this article, I browsed the AH for glyphs... sure enough. It was crammed full of low-sell-rate product at 3-4g each. Stacks and stacks of Glyph of Backstab all separated by 1c. You could refresh every couple of seconds to watch the price drop as people became more adept at using Quick Auctions.<br />

Yeah the guide's wrong, you still need to get lower herbs to skill up on (or an inscription friend to turn your northrend herbs into inks I guess, but seeing crafting the lower lvl inks gives a few skill points anyway I'd just make the lower lvl inks).</div></div><hr />

<br />
This creates a huge demand on gathered goods. His next guide should be how to make gold with herbalism. It will be a huge because of the demand the inscription guide will create.<br />
<br />
To be honest, my gold fortune comes from one trick. I work the hell out of it. Tuesday morning I had 40% of the glyphs on my auction house. I am in it for the long haul. But I get new people all the time in my market and I know how to work around them. I hate for my profits to dip like anyone else. <br />

I have expanded into other marktes, but when I first got started in inscription it was my only trick. If someone would have drove me out early on it realy would have left me with out many gold making options (or so I thought at the time).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm just glad he listed only the common, layman's ways to make gold, otherwise I'd have no income at all during the weeks it'll take for the markets to go back to normal. So far, I've been picking up cheap crafted scrolls and glyphs so I can sell them when the guides get pushed off the main page and people forget about them.<br />

It does destroy the economy when you have a highly visited site encouraging people to undercut and bomb the ah. I admit 100k in 7 weeks may be no small number, but it's pathetic profit for someone who's offering advice to the masses on how to make gold. I myself am no ah guru, but I can make double that in profits within half the time without reducing ah prices like a madman. Undercutting and bombing the ah are extremely poor tactics which crash markets, especially when done by large numbers of people. The only people his guides are benefiting are the buyers.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to reaffirm that the barriers to entry for this profession are pretty steep (takes some serious time and money to get started) but you CAN generate a nice little supply of gold doing this if your server economy permits.<br />
<br />
The best advice I can give to someone wanting to get rich off inscritpion is that you have to think long-term. Most of these guys that have hundreds of thousands of gold didn't get that way grinding out 500g or 1000g a day re-listing glyphs. . .they made 100,000g the week that inscription came out or 50,000g the week after some other patch hit using some other scheme. They had a little foresight and put themselves in a good position to take advantage of future opportunities. . . use the concept of these guides and apply them to the next major patch and you'll be set.</div></div><hr />

I started this about 24 hours ago and now i have made about 2000g profit and i also have 120 or so auctions listed that will make 1500-2500 more money depending for what price i will eventually sell them.

I feel for all the posters &quot;qqing&quot; because if I still played I'd be upset too. There is no reason for equality inside the game. Socialism isn't cool. Helping people is noble but hand-holding through an in depth guide isn't, albeit the idiots will still be idiots.<br />
<br />
I used some of the techniques listed here, an adapted approach to Dominate Your Server's AH guide, the EJ Gold Making thread, and my own insight into selling with every profession. Sparky's, Auctioneer, mail mods, and all the rest - brings back some of the few good memories from this flawed game. Heck, a good guildie friend of mine did it with me, and he easily hit the gold cap - I would have too had I not gotten disillusioned with the way the game went and is still going.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest trying out Heroes of Newerth - hated it at first but have grown to love the DOTA/HON gameplay. Aion is a very average MMO dressed up in a suit and the new Star Wars and Final Fantasy MMOs may hold some hope.<br />

Also, making 3.5g per glyph, as he does in his example *if* he sells every glyph at 6g each, is pigeon feed. You can make a LOT more than 6g on a glyph until some junior economics expert comes along and tries to apply the Walmart theory of selling to your server. At 3.5g per glyph, you need to sell 30 just to make 100g profit, 60 to make 200g profit. You can make that much in 30 minutes of Argent Crusade dailies.

I know what I'm talking about. I gold capped selling glyphs at much higher profit margins before the Walmart scribes appeared. Glyphs would be selling for 40g and they'd undercut all the way to single digits just because they are not smarter than the values they plugged into their AH addons. You just can't sell enough glyphs to be truly profitable with this method, unless you think a couple hundred gold profit per day is acceptable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has already been said several times before, but you get a friend to mill them for you and then use the ink trader in Dalaran for the inks necessary to level.<br />
<br />
This is by far the cheapest method.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What Boub has provided is knowledge (assuming it works). More available knowledge does not equal socialism. If anything it leads to more perfect competition in a CAPITALISTIC market. (Which is why so many people are crying, since they can't make as much as before.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my realm i bought 300 ink of the sea for about 1000g. Jadefire ink for example sells for 5g per piece. Thats over 1,5g profit from a single ink.<br />
<br />
Try to read this guide like a helping direction, not like a law written on a stone. I did and my profit just keeps coming to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Btw i'm not some high powered gold capped AH camper - i've got 1.2K at the moment and enjoying the game.<br />
<br />
Great guide but I don't have the time or inclination.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blodskaal</div><div class="date">2009-10-01, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just my 2 cents of how I see this guide:<br />
- gold (all night bots) farmers will have a huge boost<br />
- buying gold will probably be cheaper in a few months<br />
- mid class gold makers will have to take a small break until things calm down a bit or adapt to still make some small profits here and there.<br />
- high class gold makers will get richer<br />
- new wannabe gold makers will in 95% get poorer<br />
- people who'll start applying this guides will probably stop doing dailies<br />
- without dailies a large amount of gold disappears from the economy<br />
- people who will afford to buy gold will pretty much waste it on mounts or titles or just buy their way into high end raids, which in the end pays for guild repairs.<br />
<br />
Short: It's actually a guide that changes things a bit (not as much as some people complain), it doesn't help or does damage, except for the fact that there will actually be &quot;less&quot; money flowing around for the next few months. Maybe it will add an increase of 1% to the high class gold makers, but doing so will only make the other 90%+ poorer. <br />
<br />
In the end I have to thank Boub for making this post as I was rather dull with the fact that every moron could have already done the above stated and trade chat was already full for several months now with people buying cheep mats. At least now I hope to see people spamming other types of mats on trade :)<br />
<br />

- Most of the people who weren't already playing the AH don't like to play the AH. A fraction of them will probably start doing it, but will quit in a few days when they see that as easy as it is, you still need to spend some time doing it.<br />
<br />
- If it catches on, as the price of herbs go up, people will stop doing it for a while and most likely forget in a few weeks or the price of glyph will follow. <br />
<br />
- It is NOT an easy way to make gold, you still need to work an analyse what's going on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lazzaruss</div><div class="date">2009-10-01, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this guide had several very useful points and several very idiotic ones. we'll skip the good points and go straight to the idiotic ones since thats what y'all want to read anyways =P <br />
<br />
&quot;carpet bombing&quot; as he put it, is the most idiotic so called &quot;strategy&quot; ever. basic idea is that you bomb all the glyph prices to stupid amounts in an attempt to discourage your competition and gain a free market to work with. what is completely idiotic about this whole &quot;strategy&quot; is that your competition is likely going to have just as many 100's of glyphs as you do, and probably post as frequently. this will not discourage them from posting. glyphs have no overhead cost. selling them for anything more than the parchment they cost is a profit. it will rather, piss them the f%$k off and probably cause them to search all glyphs posted by you and cut everything you post by 1c 5 mins after you log from posting for 1hr+. then a cutting battle ensues, ending up in a slew of glyphs on the ah for 2g. everybody goes from making 5k a day to making less than 1k. even if you dont have any lashback from &quot;carpet bombing&quot; and manage to scare off your competition, you have still severely demolished your profit. enjoy trying to bring all the glyph prices back up from the 4g you bombed them to. gg. <br />
<br />
i asked a kid why he was carpet bombing, he said &quot;if i sell them for 5g instead of 50g, i will sell more than one or two.&quot; ..... apparently jr. didnt do very well in math. he can sell 10 GLYPHS at 5g each, i can sell TWO GLYPHS at 50 and still make twice the profit. to which he replied, &quot; blah blah im a nub i do what i want&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
next bit, and this ties in heavily with the above rant/rave. having 20 of every glyph. this is a terrible idea. the amount of nub out there is extraordinary. there will always be people bombing your glyphs, possibly for weeks at a time. you dont want to waste your time selling glyphs for 2g (or maybe you do). i usually stack 3-5 of every glyph i sell, and when i see a glyph price bombed to less than 6g for more than 4 days, i will either sell the stack for cheap or put in gbank until the price goes back up. if you want to have ONE character you post on, instead of 3-4 alts with 3-4 classes worth of glyphs each (which i think is retarded) you will need the bag space. there are usually only around 150 different glyphs that sell for over 20g. there is no need to have every single glyph made spread across 3-4 different alts, especially ones that do not require a book or research to learn. they will usually always be below 5g each due to non-avid posters leveling inscription.<br />
<br />
one thing that he didnt post that i do that is useful. a good way to keep you glyphs in order and be able to find one instantly instead of mousing over them for 5 mins trying to find one....alphabetize them. its a pain in the ass because of the enourmous amount you have, but in the end it is well worth your time. also, it makes replacing your glyphs and keeping your turnover simple. when you see a glyph selling for 5g, like glyph of nourish, say, search the ah for glyph of n with auctioneer set to highest bid. this will give you all the glyphs starting with n, starting with the highest price. this will ensure you replace your existing glyph with the highest priced glyph of that letter. this may seem tedious to some people, but its a good filing system for keeping your glyphs organized and current.<br />
<br />
lastly. OMFG U SERIOUS NOBLES DECKS NOT WORTH IT? i buy 4k worth of herbs, usually get 2.5 - 3 nobles decks, sell each for 5-6k, easiest 10k+ profit ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yup.. most herbs now cost about 3-4g each (yes, stacks of 20 peacebloom for 60g)<br />
Ink of the sea costs like 30-40g each<br />
Almost all glyphs go for 1g to 10g max (except the latest added ones, they're still a bit more expensive)<br />

Yes, some of the new ones will realize that it is more work than is worth it, but the point remains. If everybody did this, there would be zero profit.

Disagree. &quot;Everyone loses out&quot; is clearly false. If someone was making profit before, then someone else was losing money. If everyone makes no money, everyone also loses no money. Save any AH listing costs, nobody loses out as a whole, or gains as a whole. Be careful when using blanketing terms like &quot;everyone&quot;. Some people will make less than before, some will more more (or at least break even).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norokelt</div><div class="date">2009-10-02, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i find that an awesome guide, however...<br />
<br />
... i dont see any sense in it... with bringing it to public, .... everyone who reads them will do it, which will totaly ruin the whole guide and all the &quot;big&quot; money flows etc...<br />
<br />
1st: from todays i doubt you will find the Borean Leather to be sold on AH cheaper as 7-9g / stack, and the same goes for the Cobalt Ore, as well as the flowers, and all the other things which make profit for anyone other then the gatherers<br />
<br />
2nd: if everyone will follow those tips here showed, the AH will be flooded with Glyphs, etc. and everyone will have the prices as you have, thus none will profit from it...<br />
<br />
3rd: i doubt that someone will sell thousands of glyphs (as you claim here) on a realm where he is not the only one Inscriber...<br />
putting hundrets of something at AH will cost you deposit, and even by low deposit cost for each auctioned item it will make a nice big summ when multiplied by the amount you auction, and when there will be xx of inscribers doing the same what you then all that you will receive from mailbox will be expired/undercut/outbid auctions and you just wasted the golds for zero profit and at the deposit<br />
<br />
ie. on my realm, there is the AH dead, the econony there is close to zero (btw. THX to Blizzard for it to allow to come it so far... nvm, this is not the place where to talk about it ;) ) and the prices are absurd most of the times<br />
<br />
think about it ppl<br />
why would someone tell everyone (=his competition) how to get &quot;rich&quot;?<br />
if i learned something in the time i play wow it is that that none will tell you just so without any hidden reason how to get golds, simply just because the golds you would make could make he<br />
however i dont want to say that this guide has false / hidden interests leaning the ppl to trap... etc :D it is really just a guide, but it wont work simply anymore when now all will follow it, simply therefore.<br />
i look at it rather as at a historical fact, how someone could make easy golds, but thats past<br />
maybe you will have luck and find on the AH something with the low prices which can be turned into profit, but considering all the ppl who read this now and all the addons users, ... what do you thing how many of this &quot;profit prices&quot; you will find? :)<br />
<br />
simply publicizing the way how to make golds ruins the whole gold making<br />
ie. lets say, i make golds from mining xx ore and sell it at AH for 40g/stack... when i tell that to public, everyone who has mining will do the same ... mining the xx ore, and selling it - under my price surely - so that he gets the buyers not me... now multiply it by thousand ppl playing the game and calculate out how &quot;long&quot; it will take to cut the prices down to zero profit ;) (hint: calculate in seconds)<br />
that was just a simple example, and the same works for all variants of goldmaking<br />
the whole point in gold making is that it works for you, just because you are the only one (or one of few) who do it = profit<br />
you cant profit from something that does everyone ;)<br />
<br />
however nice guide, so the ppl can now imagine how it is possible to make golds (*how it was possible) ;)</div></div><hr />

Phoenix02 was one of the very few posters here that actually understands economics. The rest of you whining about 'ruining the economy' are either very confused or misrepresenting yourselves.<br />
<br />
Posting this guide reduced the monopoly power of scribes. This hurt most scribes by dramatically lowering their profit margins. This helped everyone else that buys glyphs.<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting this guide and lowering the price of the glyphs I buy. I like the Wal Mart scribes!</div></div><hr />
