Rank 4 Essence Required Rank 3 Before Unlock<br />
Earning Rank 3 of an Essence is a prerequisite to unlocking its Rank 4.<br />
At the same time, some activities that that are required for Rank 4, such as earning a 2400 rating in PvP, can be accumulated while you’re still at Ranks 1 and 2. <br />
<br />
<br />

If they were lazy they wouldn't have put it in the game. No need to get so outraged over it.</div></div><hr />

Can you please not post anymore? They didn't have to do it at all. Just because they have done complicated ones, doesn't mean that something simple can't also be fun. <br />
<br />
I really wish you wouldn't post anymore. Your attitude definitely isn't welcome here.</div></div><hr />

Since everyone is criticizing you for your grossly dramatic response, I too shall join in.<br />
<br />
I do not care very much for your choice of words, sire. I find the use of the F word and J word highly offensive and think you should be made pariah because this game means that much to me, and I will defend it to the online typing equivalent of &quot;my last breath.&quot;</div></div><hr />

It's essentially the TLP of the expansion with a twist (2 - 8hr spawn timer), not a massive riddle.</div></div><hr />

The mount &quot;Fabious&quot; is a reference to the model Fabio Lanzoni. Model + selfie camera = not a long stretch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? After discovering the method to acquire the mount, I thought the name was supposed to hint the word &quot;Fabulous&quot; (you know, the old blood elf jokes).<br />
<br />
I imagined the mental link we were supposed to do was Looking Fabulous = taking photos = Selfie camera.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: I had no idea who Fabio Lanzoni was. Had to check google after your post lol</div></div><hr />

Assholes probably kill it once they get their picture.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't harm him, so that's not the case.<br />
He just despawns after about 2-3 minutes. If someone takes aggro on him, he can be held there for 15 minutes(from wha I've heard) before he despawns.<br />

It's a reference to both the model and the word &quot;fabulous&quot; :)</div></div><hr />
