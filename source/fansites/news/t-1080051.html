Blizzard and Valve Queue for Legal Battlegrounds Over DotA<br />
The term &quot;DotA&quot; has long been used as the name for the popular Warcraft III mod, but Valve attempted to trademark the name for their upcoming DotA 2 game. This didn't sit well with Blizzard, with Rob Pardo saying (http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-10-23-valve-shouldnt-trademark-dota-blizzard):<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It just seems a really strange move to us that Valve would go off and try to exclusively trademark the term considering it's something that's been freely available to us and everyone in the Warcraft III community up to this point...To us, that means that you're really taking it away from the Blizzard and Warcraft III community and that just doesn't seem the right thing to do&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Valve then countered that the community was okay with it, with Gabe Newell saying (http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-08-22-dota-trademark-blizzard-valve-respond):<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The issue with that was, when we were talking with IceFrog originally, he wanted to build the sequel to DOTA. So the reason to call it Dota 2 is it actually does a pretty good job of communicating to gamers what it is the game is going to be. If a gamer looks at this game and you ask them, is that Dota 2? They're going to say yeah, that makes sense. That's a good name for it. That's really what's driving that. I haven't had any customers or gamers react negatively to it. They seem to be pretty comfortable with it.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Two of the developers that were involved with the original DotA game filed to block Valve's application, which is still an ongoing case (http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91200863&amp;pty=OPP). In Blizzard's opposition filing (http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?eno=1&amp;pno=91202572&amp;pty=OPP&amp;mode=frame), they contend that DotA has been used by the community for the Warcraft 3 mod and that Valve has never used it before.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;DOTA, that for more than seven years has been used exclusively by Blizzard and its fan community, under license from Blizzard. By virtue of that use, the DOTA mark has become firmly associated in the mind of consumers with Blizzard, including to signify a highly popular scenario or variant of one of Blizzard's best-selling computer games, Warcraft III...<br />
<br />
In contrast to Blizzard, Applicant Valve Corporation (&quot;Valve&quot;) has never used the mark DOTA in connection with any product or service that currently is available to the public. By attempting to register the mark DOTA, Valve seeks to appropriate the more than seven years of goodwill that Blizzard has developed in the mark DOTA and in its Warcraft III computer game and take for itself a name that has come to signify the product of years of time and energy expended by Blizzard and by fans of Warcraft III. &quot;<br />
Blizzard then goes on to argue that the World Editor EULA requires Blizzard's prior written consent to use for any commercial purpose, which they have granted to various 3rd parties for the promotion of the DotA mod. Valve's response (http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/ttabvue-91202572-OPP-4.pdf) is a denial or lack of sufficient information claim of anything that mentions Blizzard's widespread and long standing use of the mark. <br />
<br />
The companies will either come to an agreement of some kind or the case could move on to a trial later this year. <br />

LoLPro - League of Legends Guides<br />
League of Legends (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/336-League-of-Legends) is a fairly popular game, so our friends over at LoLPro.com have put together in depth guides and videos for the champions. Every guide is authored by a professional League of Legends player such as Voyboy, Salce, Doublelift, Crumbzz, SYDTKO, Pobelter, Westrice, Dyrus, Nyjacky and many more.<br />
<br />
The guides may be helpful should you want to improve your skills to participate in the next tournament. The first Curse tournament (http://www.lolpro.com/tournaments/176-curse-presents-the-lol-pro-invitational-tournament) will have eight teams competing for a $5,000 prize. The winning team will then be flown to Curse headquarters in San Francisco, to play the Curse team, for a chance at an additional $20,000. <br />

World of Warcraft War College – Getting Geared<br />
The battlefields of World of Warcraft are littered with the bones of those who have become casualties in the ongoing conflict between the Horde and the Alliance. You do not need to become one of them. One of the keys to victory is knowledge, and that is where the World of Warcraft War College enters the picture. In these discussions between players, you can learn and share strategies with other players to improve your tactics and improve your odds of emerging victorious from the field of battle.<br />
<br />
Are you a veteran Gladiator with countless victories tallied? Are you new to World of Warcraft and striving to improve your PvP skills? In this weekly feature, we invite players of all skill levels to ask questions, share tips and tactics, and join a conversation dedicated to surviving and thriving in World of Warcraft PvP.<br />
<br />
This week, the topic of discussion is:<br />
<br />
Getting Geared – Whether getting ready to jump into PvP with a new character or preparing for a new PvP season, it’s important to get enough Resilience on your items to be competitive. What are the best techniques you've found to gear up fast?<br />

Bind on Account items<br />
In terms of Bind on Account items, we believe that using the mail system to transfer heirlooms from one character to another is less than ideal. We’d like to work ourselves away from that sort of item distribution model, and have some design goals in mind that would change the mechanics of how heirlooms are distributed in-game.<br />
<br />
We think it would be wonderful to simplify the system so that, for example, you might have a constant heirloom page across all your characters that you could peruse and select from at your leisure. Conceivably, we could do something similar for pets and mounts.<br />
<br />
As always, these sorts of design ideas are constantly being evaluated. I just think it’s worth pointing out we’re not currently aiming to create a system that would allow players to mail heirlooms across realms or accounts. We believe that would be a sub-optimal design, and we have better solutions in mind for the future.

<br />
Winning Multiple Items in LFR<br />
Our patch note is wrong and we apologize for the confusion. We'll get it updated.<br />
<br />
The way it currently works is you'll lose the Need+ roll bonus if you win an item that drops twice from the same boss, but you won't be made completely ineligible to win it twice. If no one else has the Need+ bonus or rolls Need on the item, you'd still win it. <br />
<br />
We have updated the 4.3.2 patch notes to better describe the way this system change works.<br />
<br />
Players no longer benefit from a role-based need bonus on the second of multiple copies of the same item on a single Raid Finder boss kill. For example, a player who chooses Need on two set piece tokens or two weapons (and wins the first) will only automatically roll 1-100 for the second from that particular boss.

Low Population Realms<br />
That thread is one that we are monitoring continuously for feedback, and those who wish to get their voice heard on this topic will certainly get their wish granted if they post in said thread.<br />
<br />
We acknowledge that this is a very important topic for those of you playing on realms with low population, and it is an important topic for us as well. We are looking into ways to improve the situation, but as we mentioned in the thread linked to by Danellos above, there is no simple and easy fix to this.

Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator<br />
Thank you for your feedback on the Warlock talents, however as you have mentioned the talents are not set in stone right now and may change. You have to remember that the Mists of Pandaria talent calculator was placed on the website towards the end of November last year and it has not been updated on the website since. During these past few months of development though, there would have been major changes that are not able to see yet.<br />
<br />
We will probably not be updating the talent calculator until we're around about at the point of the friends and family alpha test. The reason for this is that it is not exactly useful or efficient for us to be continuously updating the calculator at this stage. <br />
<br />
There have been no announcements for when an update to the Talent Calculator will be released. But I am sure we are all hoping for a more up-to-date talent calculator to be revealed, because I know everyone would like to see what has been done to refine and improve upon the ones we see now!

Annual Pass and Diablo III Release Date<br />
I've seen these threads before, and it’s concerning to me. I'm confused as to what people believed the Annual Pass provided when they signed up.<br />
<br />
It's a year-long World of Warcraft contract for people who would be playing World of Warcraft for the next year, but who also want to play Diablo III. In those cases we say Ok, agree to pay through for that year, and you don't have to make the choice, we'll give you Diablo III for free, plus a bunch of other goodies just in case you're not totally sold.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how a Diablo III release date impacts your intent to continue playing and paying for World of Warcraft for a year. Or maybe a better question is, how does a free copy of Diablo III being released at any different point in time affect your intent to pay for World of Warcraft for a year?<br />
<br />
Even if Diablo III was to release after your 1 year contract was up and paid off, you're saving the cost of a copy of Diablo III, and keeping all the extras. I don't see how that's a trick, or a scam, or otherwise a bad deal. Unless you were buying it, not intending to play WoW, believing it would get you Diablo III sooner than other people?<br />
<br />
I sympathize with people excited about the game, and disappointed it’s not out, I want it to be finished as much as anyone, but I just have trouble understanding this point as I see it consistently made. <br />
<br />
I know there was some wording on a website page somewhere saying 'early next year', but I'm not aware of the actual Annual Pass agreement having any release date schedule ever mentioned for Diablo III or the Mists beta.<br />
<br />
In any case, assumptions that a contract was in any way changed aside, it doesn't change the value of the Annual Pass and the fact that you're getting Diablo III for free.

Actually, it's more like Valve suing id for trying to poach the Team Fortress name. DOTA is strictly a Blizzard thing. Valve has never used this trademark before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DOTA started out as a Fan-made Warcraft 3 mod and Valve was nowhere in the picture when it came out. I really can't see Valve winning this, especially if Blizzard's Warcraft 3 World Editor was used to make the original DOTA.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">salate</div><div class="date">2012-02-11, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard 7 years ago - &quot;we dont care about Dota&quot; Valve x years ago &quot;We should made Dota2, cuz Dota is unplayable for us, and we wanna make it!&quot; (from Gaben words in some interview he said &quot;we tried to play with fellas in dota, and found it nice but unplayable&quot; Blizzard today - &quot;We care about Dota, u should earn nothing from this game!&quot; Valve today - &quot;Cmon lol, why so serious?&quot; :D I think if Valve would have taken Element TD instead of Dota Blizz would cry aswell :) But we both know why they go such a way, they just wanna earn money from that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaril</div><div class="date">2012-02-11, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem, I imagine, that Rob has with what valve is doing is that by trademarking DOTA, it effectively eliminates DoTA from Wc3. Even though doTA came out 7-8 years ago and the original author of DoTA is now the author of DoTA2, Valve owning the trademark basically forces DoTA to change it's name to something else. At the same time I imagine that Valve is looking to trademark since they will be developing a real commercial application using the name and prevent other software development companies from creating a product and calling it DoTA also.<br />
<br />
The ideal solution would be for an agreement by Valve and Blizzard that gives IceFrog the trademark for DoTA, and IceFrog allows Blizzard and Valve permanent licensed/authorized use of DoTA.<br />
<br />
What's going to be interesting here though, is that with the new IP laws, trademarks and copyrights are no longer who proves who made what first, but who brings the matter to the patent office for copyright or trademark. For example, just because DoTA existed for years before Valve filed their application, does not in any way impede their application due to prior work/art/usage.<br />
<br />
I sure hope that Blizzard and Valve pursue this matter to the supreme court where they can rule on the IP law signed last year.</div></div><hr />

Regardless of who wins people will still play Dota 2 even if they call it TaoD...yeah that's right The ancients of Defense (although knowing blizz they already trademarked that too) gotta get that money.</div></div><hr />

They are pretending they don't know the reason? It's very simple! People thought they will be playing Diablo 3 while waiting for MOP release but paying for failed Cataclysm instead of just buying D3 and quiting Wow. And now they can't play D3 but they also can't quit Wow so they are locked to play crappy DS for another 2-5 months which makes Annual Pass profitable only for Blizzard but not players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard should win the lawsuit in this case. Still, I think &quot;Blizzard All-Stars&quot; is a better name than &quot;Blizzard DotA&quot;. Even then, DotA is the name of a game, not a category at all. <br />
<br />
Riot Games tried to name this type of game &quot;Moba, multiplayer online battle arena&quot;, but any true Warcraft 3 gamers would know the category of all 3 of these games is &quot;AoS&quot;.

Like many of the other custom games that have been made in their various Map Editors, Blizzard has let the players have free reign and stayed out of interfering with them, basically, giving the players freedom to create what they want. Regardless, they were doing this with a Blizzard product. For anyone else to try to claim ownership or copyright of the newer version of a game made using Blizzard software and a Blizzard franchise is utterly ridiculous.

<br />
exactly. Blizzard believes that the name DoTA should remain in public domain. the problem is that it is in valves interests to trademark DoTA for a game with the same name. Since DoTA came way before valve, you would think this would be a slam dunk for blizzard, but as i said, new IP laws beg to differ.</div></div><hr />

I could be wrong, because I see the whole issue as too ridiculous to spend much time really reading up on it. But if my impression is right, I see nothing at all wrong with Blizzard's stance.<br />
<br />
Yep, that's what I took it as as well. Blizzard's never tried to trademark anything to do with DotA, just, of course, the tools it was made with. Valve's trying to trademark it, when it really applies to a large variety of games.... I don't see how it'd be a problem if it was, for example, DotA 2 instead of just plain DotA as a series. They're sort of overstepping their boundaries, from what I'm reading.<br />

The thing is, somebody else has already used that name in correlation with a Blizzard product. Valve doesn't have much of a claim to it, where as Blizzard has years of having it a part of their community. Valve is seemingly trying to take it for themselves.</div></div><hr />

Lol, And did they really just say they have *clears throat and quotes* &quot;no simple or easy fix for this&quot; concerning low pop servers? hahahah.

<br />
By naming the product &quot;DOTA 2&quot;, they're acknowledging there was a DOTA 1. I'm saying they shouldn't be able to take the trademark for an existing series.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phenom568</div><div class="date">2012-02-11, 06:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The original DOTA is a fan made game in the Blizzard Warcraft III Map Editor. It was made using Blizzard created models, characters, maps, animations, and a Blizzard game. Like many of the other custom games that have been made in their various Map Editors, Blizzard has let the players have free reign and stayed out of interfering with them, basically, giving the players freedom to create what they want. Regardless, they were doing this with a Blizzard product. For anyone else to try to claim ownership or copyright of the newer version of a game made using Blizzard software and a Blizzard franchise is utterly ridiculous. Doubly so if &quot;World Editor EULA requires Blizzard's prior written consent to use for any commercial purpose&quot; is true.<br />
<br />
As I understand it the name DOTA belongs technically to the creator of the mod who now works for valve. Blizzard doesn't own the name DOTA just the original DOTA project which is warcraft 3, and should be called warcraft 3. Now valve comes along and wants to make DOTA 2 with the original creator of DOTA and technically the name, and the name only, belongs to him. Blizzard then says hey lets make a warcraft DOTA and I don't believe its coincidence that they made this decision so close to DOTA 2. Strike while the iron is hot basically. Well valve takes offense to that because they are afraid, and rightfully so, that people will confuse blizzard DOTA with DOTA 2. Since we all love to break things down to simple terms DOTA will be used to describe them both and thus confuse the consumer. So valve wants a copyright to prevent the confusion and loss of cash. Blizzard is for whatever reason late to the game and believes no one owns the name.<br />
<br />
Saying blizzard owns DOTA name would be like saying they own terms like Noob, trash, etc. They own the product which is warcraft 3 but do not own the name DOTA.</div></div><hr />

They are pretending they don't know the reason? It's very simple! People thought they will be playing Diablo 3 while waiting for MOP release but paying for failed Cataclysm instead of just buying D3 and quiting Wow. And now they can't play D3 but they also can't quit Wow so they are locked to play crappy DS for another 2-5 months which makes Annual Pass profitable only for Blizzard but not players.<br />
<br />
Though people still get a year long subscription to WoW and a copy of Diablo 3 whenever it releases (I don't seem to recall anything regarding a timeframe for that in the contract). The Annual Pass was a 1 year subscription plus Diablo 3 and some other stuff, and that is what people will receive. People's anger comes from the pushback of the release date, which has nothing to do with the Annual Pass. The original poster in that forum stated that the Annual Pass was &quot;borderline FRAUD!&quot;, and Bashiok attempted to clear the air. If you only purchased the Annual Pass for the Diablo 3... well you shouldn't have done that. You are still getting exactly what you paid for though, and no reason to complain about the Annual Pass specifically.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That should teach those players not to go by assumptions next time, and Blizz didn't lock anyone into annual pass forcefully. Again, if players signed up for it under assumptions and didn't know exactly what they were signing up for they are the one to blame.</div></div><hr />

You said the opposite, it was incorrect. Blizzard has no trademark on DotA, Defense of the Ancients, MOBA or anything of the sort. It's a community term. Valve's the one trying to trademark DotA, essentially trying to make it no longer a community term. This obviously doesn't sit too well with Blizzard, considering it's been their community term for 7 years and Valve's trying to associate it with their name instead of Blizzard's. See why it's a problem?<br />
<br />
(Unless of course Blizzard does have a trademark and I'm incorrect, then it'd be a problem, just with different motivations, likely including money.)</div></div><hr />

What is their reasoning for fighting it if its not to trademark it themselves.

The legalities are a gray area. The map editor's EULA does prohibit commercial use of things made in the editor, although I'm not if that can really be extend to simple names. <br />
<br />
Still, Icefrog is not the owner of the DoTA name. In fact, the idea for the name &quot;Defense of the Ancients&quot; originally borrows from Warcraft 3 lore and was a play off War of the Ancients story which was in the game manual.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in the end, blizz had to drop the suit but that's how they are. they are a business. they run like a business and care about stuff that businesses care about. businesses don't care about anything but money. <br />
<br />
the fact that they are probably gonna end up suing valve over this is proof that they were never going to let it go in the first place.<br />
<br />
Brutal Legend was being financed by Sierra, which was merged into Activision, which was merged into Activision Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is, for all intents and purposes, an independent company with the publisher Activision Blizzard.<br />

&quot;Blizzard doesnt want it for themselves, they want it to be public domain. If DotA is trademarked, they wont be able to have &quot;Blizzard DotA&quot; after all... would be a pretty big slap in the face if they werent able to use that name, ya know?&quot;<br />
<br />
I already said this exact same thing. Also, they arent copyrighting, they are trademarking. Trademarking would mean the term &quot;DotA&quot; would be off limits for anybody unless they get permission from Valve. Copyrighting means people cant make copies of the game DotA 2</div></div><hr />

Regardless of any ulterior motives on all sides, Valve shouldn't be trying to trademark it. If the case were in the end to come down to whose territory DotA is in, it'd be Blizzard's for the simple reason that if there had been no Warcraft III, then there would've been no DotA.<br />

Think of it this way : Why is Valve trademarking DOTA ? To prevent anyone coming years later and claiming a term that is associated with them. What are Valve effectively doing by trademarking DOTA ? They're coming years later and claiming a term that is associated with Blizzard. Blizzard just wants it to stay a public, non-owned term, like it has been for the last 8 years. Unless you're a Valve shareholder, I don't see how anyone wouldn't side with Blizzard on this one.</div></div><hr />

Lead developer is hardly ownership. It also completely ignores years of development by Eul, Guinsoo, contributing authors, the people that maintained the entire freaking community that fostered the games development, etc etc.<br />

Lol, blizzard has always cared for the community, they still do that's why the don't want a company holding a trademark over a community created title (DOTA).<br />
The problem is, they don't care for your community, a group of people that whine and groan and moan over everything they don't like in a game.<br />
Blizzard has to think about the wishes and needs of 10m+ people, that's 10m different wishes right there and no they can't fullfill them all.<br />

And... how do they make money off of their non-trademarked free mod that would still otherwise exist and will continue to exist even after it is trademarked (though under a different name)? Where are the profits there? The term &quot;DotA&quot; is applied to the GENRE. More people recognize the term dota instead of moba. &quot;What is LoL like?&quot; -&gt; &quot;Kinda like DotA&quot; not &quot;its a moba&quot;<br />

They applied for trademark in 2010, its been ongoing since then.<br />
<br />
PS: Valve is in the business in picking up free games from modders, trademarking, then selling. Obviously they arent selling DotA 2, but they did for CS, portal, and team fortress. They are very good at doing things like this.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard sees the cash cow that is the DotA genre and is trying desperately to hold on to the original IP and all things associated with it. From the business side of things, Blizzard made little to no effort on the DotA sequel production front until IceFrog and the majority of his team announced their hiring and production of a DotA sequel.

Blizzard lawsuit<br />
<br />
Just the stuff i wanted to read...<br />
<br />
I hope Valve wins. Mostly because i have the dota 2 beta, because dota is awesome, and because Blizzard NEVER EVER CARED before about it. So after 7 years Blizzard still doesnt care about DotA, except ofcourse when another company comes around and does have the balls and the energy to try and make an actual game out of it. Then they're suddenly such a victim. I dont buy how Blizzard has had much to do with DotA anyway, it was a little costum game that was developer by nobody in Blizzard, and i doubt they'll be missing out on a lot of warcraft 3 money if Valve somehow happens to have another DotA. <br />
It feels like a kid getting a tantrum and throwing paper around because he picked the wrong game to play during break time, even though he got to pick first.<br />

The game is still on the beta and it had a 1.6 million dollar tournament august last year, that alone tells me that valve really wants the game to be popular, unlike blizzard who only wants their piece of the cake.</div></div><hr />

NOW they're trying to trademark? Yeah, then we'll say: <br />
<br />
Fanboyism is slowly making people worse and worse<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't want to to trademark it, they want to stop Valve from getting trademark and excluding the modding community from dota. Valve fanboy, lol. They don't care if Valve uses the name dota 2 either, but trademarking dota is a huge difference.<br />

And why are they suddenly so thrilled to have the wonderful dota modding community not being poorly excluded?<br />
<br />
Why dont you try to understand my post?<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, a few years ago they told that 'dota modding community' to go F themselves. <br />
<br />
I dont give a damn if Valve calls Dota 2, OtaD 2. Blizzard is still a little kid over this, and you're kidding yourself if you think they do this out of their good heart over the DotA 1 Modding Community.<br />
<br />
Why do you think Blizzard is some benevolent divine being? What are you, a fanboy?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kzilla</div><div class="date">2012-02-11, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They can use the name without trademarking it.<br />
Which is what blizzard did, which is why this is even an issue. Bad idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only ones greedy here = valve. Anyway, valve has always been pretty &quot;grabby-grabby&quot; when it comes to these things, which is why I don't like them.<br />
How is Valve greedy? For trying to trademark and produce a sequel to the original DotA by giving it's original creators and developers tons of money, manpower and computer power and saying &quot;go make the sequel game you want to make that you could never make because of lack of money, dev time, processing, etc&quot;? <br />
<br />
Here is the Blizzard DotA trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx1JDEnrVK8<br />
Just like every off-shoot gimmicky scenario game Blizz develops, it's basically a Blizz Universe parody of the DotA genre. The heros are all Diablo/Warcraft/Starcraft characters and units with spells from the DotA genre. They are not making DotA 2, they are making a DotA (the genre) game. <br />
<br />
tl:dr Blizzard is trying to stop a direct sequel to the original DotA by saying they own it but the DotA they are making is just modified SC2 units with DotA spells. Might be good for business, but bad for us DotA lovers.</div></div><hr />

I didn't know the WoW community have become so dumb and so ignorant, they see every Blizzard action as something horrible. Now I don't play DotA and I have no idea about it. But it seems like Blizzard wants the title DotA to remain a community title. They have no problem with who uses it, Valve, the community, Mario, Sonic, Zelda, Commander Shepard. They just want a community thing to stay a community thing, and not owned by some greedy company. And people have a problem with that? <br />
<br />
Who gives a fuck if Blizzard didn't care about DotA. They don't seem to care about it now either. They just want something belonging to the public to stay that way. They are fighting for it, might possibly loose millions of dollars WHILE TRYING TO FIGHT FOR THE COMMUNITY and that is a wrong thing?! Blizzard sells pets online and the community goes mad, but Valve try to take something away from the public, something huge, something loved and people applaud it? <br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't care about DotA. <br />
Blizzard doesn't care if Valve is making DotA 2.<br />
Blizzard doesn't want Valve to trademark DotA because it will take away the freedom from the community, Blizzard and anyone else to use DotA. <br />
Blizzard is the bad guy here. Brain fart!! <br />
<br />
People need to get over the fact that WoW is not the same game it was and need to put aside their hatred against everything Blizzard does. No, I don't play WoW, I hate it now, it's not the game for me anymore due to various reasons. Blizzard are greedy. But in this case, Blizzard are absolutely right. Valve are wrong. I love both companies however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It just seems a really strange move to us that Valve would go off and try to exclusively trademark the term considering it's something that's been freely available to us and everyone in the Warcraft III community up to this point...To us, that means that you're really taking it away from the Blizzard and Warcraft III community and that just doesn't seem the right thing to do&quot;. <br />

<br />
They aren't trying to trademark it themself but it's clear that they don't wanna get gued by Valve for using Blizzard dota name. Which I happen to agree with Blizzard that Dota should remain public. Dota doesn't belong to Valve,Icefrog.Blizzard or anyone.</div></div><hr />

If Valve trademark the name DOTA, then I guess Blizzard will either have to rename their DOTA tournie, pay Valve to use the name, or just not hold them any more. Or maybe the trademark will extend to the gameplay itself, which means they couldn't even rename it.<br />
<br />
Does that sound fair? It doesn't to me.<br />
<br />
Blizzard don't want to stop anyone else using the term DOTA (and there are other people than Blizz that use it), they just want to prevent Valve from stopping anyone else using it. Blizzard want it to remain in the public domain.<br />

These Valve fanbois want to shut down the likes of DotA-Allstars. What idiots.</div></div><hr />

You don't release a brand new game and name it after something that has been in the public domain for years AND THEN TRY TO TRADEMARK IT, stomping all over the modders and gaming community who have been using it for all that time.<br />
<br />
How can anyone think that's a good idea? I guess all the supporters of The Man have come crawling out.<br />
<br />
What next? Basshunter will have to remove his DOTA song (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OzWIFX8M-Y) from 5 years ago, because the name is now trademarked? Madness.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyghost</div><div class="date">2012-02-11, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Valve is going to win this lawsuit. It's like if id tried to sue Valve over the Team Fortress name.<br />
<br />
The ONLY reason that Valve got to make Team Fortress 2 was that Team Fortress (the mod it was spun off of) was based off of Half Life... yanno, VALVE'S own physics/game editor/IP. Their own EULA granted themselves the privilege to help themselves to build a franchise off of a mod of their own game.<br />
<br />
DOTA is NOT based off of their own physics engine/editor/IP, but 100% Blizzard's. In fact, you could even argue that DOTA could collectively be a name for a genre of games.... that Valve attempting to copyright DOTA is as stupid as them attempting to copyright &quot;First-Person Shooter&quot;. Their attempt to trademark &quot;DOTA&quot; just so they could make &quot;DOTA 2&quot; implies that they started it, which they didn't. A modder using an engine that was never Valve's, IP that was never Valve's, and an editor that was never Valve's made DOTA.<br />
<br />
Valve has zero legal grounds to copyright it, and if it goes to court they are going to lose. It's as simple as that.<br />
<br />
And for the record, Blizzard was never interested in copyrighting DOTA, if they wanted to they could've done it ages ago, but they knew that DOTA belonged to the community of original WC3 players and the new genre it spun off with LOL and HON. This is an issue 100% spawned off of Valve's greed and considering that it did begin with WC3, Blizzard knows that they're the only ones that can really stand to challenge Valve properly on copyright grounds.<br />

Valve should of course trademark the game.Dota 2 isn't a free custom mod anymore. It's brand new game developed by Valve and will go on to sell own copies.It would feel more strange if Dota was not trademarked. You don't release a brand new game and not trademark the name. I don't even think an indie developer would do that.<br />
<br />
You don't get it.<br />
<br />
DOTA is practically a game genre now. Valve attempting to copyright DOTA for their IP is like someone attempting to copyright &quot;First-Person Shooter 2&quot; as a sequel to DOOM.<br />
<br />
It's stupid, and it's greedy. Valve is making a grab at something that's existed in the public space, that's all there is to it. They'd even probably get the nerve to sue LOL or HON if they get the copyright.<br />
<br />
Copyrighting DOTA hurts everyone and simply files money into Valve's pockets. Period.</div></div><hr />

Are you having difficulty understanding what's happening here? Do you think that Blizzard are trying to trademark the name?<br />
<br />
Let me set you straight.<br />
<br />
Valve want to trademark the name. Blizzard want to prevent them from doing so. <br />
Blizzard do not want to trademark the name themselves. Blizzard want the name to remain in the public domain, as it has for many years.<br />
<br />
Additionally, two of the developers that were involved with the original DotA game filed to block Valve's application. That case is still ongoing.<br />
<br />
Do you get it now?</div></div><hr />

This. Valve didn't say shit when Blizzard copied their game titles for their little map - who cares, right? It's just a name, and it's all in good fun, never mind the fact that it's part of a game that people are paying money for.<br />
<br />
But the second Valve tries to do the same thing, Blizzard (read: Activision) goes apeshit.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I feel like telling Blizzard to go eat a dick here. They have no claim to the DOTA copyright, and neither do the guys that created it - they can say &quot;we would prefer you don't use it,&quot; but they have no legal recourse here.<br />
<br />
I do think Valve should just capitulate and go with &quot;Defense of the Ancients 2&quot; or whatever, and honestly... I wouldn't be surprised if this happens. Valve's always been the Good Guy Greg of gaming.</div></div><hr />

Another person who doesn't really understand.<br />
<br />
Blizzard DID NOT TRADEMARK the name &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot;. They may have used a similar name, BUT THEY DID NOT ATTEMPT TO COPYRIGHT IT AND IT WASN'T EVEN THE SAME NAME ANYWAY.<br />
<br />
Yet here is Valve TRYING TO TRADEMARK the name &quot;Defense of the Ancients&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you can't understand the difference between just using a similar name and actually trademarking an identical name, well, there's not much I can say.<br />
<br />
What right does Valve have to take the name away from all the hard-working modders who put a lot of work into DOTA? You're supporting The Man over joe public, I guess.</div></div><hr />

Yes, therefore it Valve doesn't have any claims on it, just because they hired Icefrog. Even more claiming that it's a sequel to DOTA.<br />

I dont think Valve stands much of a chance, but this whole thing is lowering my opinon of Blizzard. The DotA 2 development has been announced for over a year now?<br />

i mean it more like blizzard has used the name dota all over the place, a few examples: blizzard dota, dota genre on sc2, dota styled BG in MoP. if valve wins they can sue the hell out of blizzard for all those terms. blizzard claiming they do it for the community is just looking better then if we dont do it we are in big shit. though i don't believe blizzard will go all the way and try to claim the name for themself noone will believe them afterwards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically this. Valve wants to block blizzard and anyone else from using the word DotA in their game name. If it does pass which it is doubtful that it will Blizzard would not be able to name their DotA Blizzard DotA. <br />
<br />
Instead of thinking less about Blizzard as seems to be the &quot;cool kid&quot; thing to do nowadays, in reality you should think less of Valve for trying to squeeze another pretty penny out of yah.<br />
<br />
In reality DotA is a style of game play in my opinion, Not a game. There has been at least 4 games that are all competing successfully that share this style of game play. It would be wrong for them to own a genre of gaming.</div></div><hr />

Icefrog did none of these.. he just played around with a toy that blizzard made.. in my opinion blizzard owns everything about dota except the idea.. For dota to be a map in warcraft 3 is the same as having a character in wow.. Aint something you can just go and take for yourself.. It's a d**k move from vavle to try and take patent on a name that is used all over the place just so they have the rights for the game and so they can make more money of it.<br />
<br />
This is not a vavle vs blizzard.. this is a Valve vs (all other DotA looking games) just because valve want money.. i hold with blizzard on this one DotA should not be owned by anyone..<br />
<br />
Also blizzard could have trademarked the s**t out of the DotA name.. but they didn't, cus they want it to be open for everyone</div></div><hr />

They are pretending they don't know the reason? It's very simple! People thought they will be playing Diablo 3 while waiting for MOP release but paying for failed Cataclysm instead of just buying D3 and quiting Wow. And now they can't play D3 but they also can't quit Wow so they are locked to play crappy DS for another 2-5 months which makes Annual Pass profitable only for Blizzard but not players.<br />
<br />
If the only reason you pursued the annual contract was for a &quot;free&quot; copy of D3, then you failed. You would have been better off quitting WoW until MoP and using the saving to purchase D3 saving yourself a bunch of money in the mean time. <br />
<br />
The one year contract was made for people that would be playing WoW for the next year regardless of content/expansion/whatever. It was never designed for &quot;lolz, I haz free copy of D3&quot;. Everyone knew that 4.3 was it for this expansion. Everyone knew that you had two choices (just like every other expansion) of either farming DS or quitting until the 5.0 patch hits. The smart money has always been on a Q3/Q4 release of MoP and that that one year contract was pretty much going to carry you to the end of Cata. <br />
<br />
Caveat Emptor (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caveat_emptor) As consumers, we knew full well going into this, that there was a really good chance D3 was going to be delayed, well, anyone that has followed Blizzard products for any length of time knew.</div></div><hr />

Funny how Blizz tells you early next year we will release D3 ... buy this bundle of D3 and WoW. You will get D3 after you get tired of DS, then there will be MoP beta ... you will have stuff to do all the time. And then there goes nothing. Also the talk about we will do frequent updates ... and then DS-&gt;MoP 10-13 month gap.<br />

Blizzard didn't tell you any such thing. They told you &quot;pay for one year of WoW access, and you'll get a free copy of Diablo 3 when it's released, and guaranteed access to the MoP beta&quot;. That's it. Whether D3 releases tomorrow, June 1, or December 31, you will get:<br />
<br />
1) one year of WoW access, <br />
2) free D3, and<br />
3) guaranteed access to the MoP beta.<br />
<br />
Here, since you won't believe me, is the text straight from WoW's website:<br />
<br />
<br />
With Deathwing’s shadow looming over Azeroth and the mortal realms of Sanctuary steeling for war against the forces of Diablo, the World of Warcraft Annual Pass has arrived to offer WoW subscribers a chance to participate in both apocalyptic conflicts… without breaking the bank.<br />
<br />
For a limited time only, players who make a 12-month subscription commitment to World of Warcraft through the WoW Annual Pass will receive the following epic rewards:<br />
<br />
Diablo III FREE – Download the digital version via Battle.net for free when the game launches. This is the full game, not a trial edition.<br />
Tyrael’s Charger WoW Flying Mount – Ride for the Archangel of Justice on all current and future characters on a single World of Warcraft account. Tyrael’s Charger will arrive via in-game mail with the upcoming launch of patch 4.3.<br />
Access to the Next WoW Expansion Beta Test – Get a guaranteed spot in the beta test for the next World of Warcraft expansion (at a time to be announced in the future).<br />
<br />
You can pay for the WoW Annual Pass on a monthly basis at $14.99 per month or according to the billing plan of your choice. To participate, you must be 18 or older, have a valid credit card, and have registered a full version of World of Warcraft on or before October 18, 2011.<br />
<br />
Sign up for the World of Warcraft Annual Pass here, and then keep an eye on the World of Warcraft community site or the Diablo III community site for future announcements regarding the launch dates of these bonuses.<br />
<br />
For more information on this offer, including eligibility requirements and details on how the World of Warcraft Annual Pass applies to players who plan to purchase the Diablo III: Collector’s Edition, please read the full FAQ.<br />
<br />
(Source: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3767193)<br />
<br />
See? &quot;when the game launches&quot;. &quot;future announcements regarding the launch dates of these bonuses&quot;. That's all they ever claimed. And since we STILL don't have a release date for D3, you thinking you'd be playing it now is your mistake, not Blizzard's.<br />
<br />
(This is, of course, putting aside the fact that for those people that would otherwise not be playing WoW any more, but that signed up for the annual pass just to get free D3, Blizzard is making those people pay $180 ($15 per month for one year) to get a free copy of a $60 game.)<br />
<br />
So it's your own fault for assuming something that a simple check of Blizzard's website would show is completely untrue. No one is to blame here but you.</div></div><hr />

DOTA is strictly a Blizzard thing. Valve has never used this trademark before.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not at all like that, Valve owns Team fortress they don't own DOTA<br />
<br />
<br />
DOTA started out as a Fan-made Warcraft 3 mod and Valve was nowhere in the picture when it came out. I really can't see Valve winning this, especially if Blizzard's Warcraft 3 World Editor was used to make the original DOTA.<br />
<br />
<br />
Totally, because Team Fortress was totally a name that was originally given to a mod from a blizzard game, yeah, I see, completely the same situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
No but Team Fortress was totally a community total conversion mod for an id software game called Quake. It's the exact same situation, only that id software doesn't claim ownership on community created stuff, like Blizzard does if you read between the lines. <br />
<br />
Anyway somehow Team Fortress turned to be trademarked by Valve and noone is complaining. Blizzard could have trade marked the name years ago, Valve was first however. <br />
<br />

Trademarking DotA is not a good idea, at all. Blizzard is completely right that it should remain the public domain, since that gives everyone (Even you and I.) a fair shot at using the idea. Not to mention that the trademark would be intruding on Blizzard's ip, when DotA is associated to their company and is a product made from Blizzard's tools and game, and not with the original creator (Who is not even the one developing DOTA 2 for Valve.).<br />
<br />
As others have already said, this is a dickish move from Valve. Blizzard have let the DotA name be in the public domain for several years and allowed the creators to monetize the mod, despite that Blizzard have control over all the mods done in their map editors. Now Valve are going to take control over the brand by trademarking it and therefore having full control over the name and the franchise. They must not simply win this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard didn't make DOTA they made warcraft 3. Unless DOTA 2 is still using the models from warcraft 3 blizz has no claim to it. Icefrog owns the name because he created the mod which is DOTA 2. As many have said blizz didn't care about DOTA at all, but DOTA 2 could rival Starcraft in terms of tourney dollars which is why we are getting blizzard DOTA. If valve trademarks the name blizz has to name their game something else which means it will be harder to sell it for tourneys because people won't make the connection. Why blizzard didn't trademark the name years ago is beyond me and that's probably why they are upset now realizing they are the last dog to the bowl. Claiming to want it to be &quot;community use&quot; is a joke because they know they can't copyright it now so they don't want anyone else to either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There was never any &quot;clause&quot;. Release dates change. If you bought the one year pass to jut get D3, then you have no idea how to manage your money, nor can you spot a good deal. As been stated to you many times in this thread, this deal was for people that planned on playing WoW for the year, without taking a break. Not someone that was looking to score a &quot;free&quot; copy of the game, then quit WoW while they waited for MoP to be released. <br />
<br />
As for the release date of D3 being pushed back, I'm glad. I want the game to be as close to perfect and not be shoved out the door unfinished like a certain MMO that was pushed out before christmas just to make the season.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regardless, it DOES matter that IceFrog didnt create it, because that means the term DotA was originally coined by Eul.<br />
<br />
Sure, but success has to have something to do with it. Guinsoo gave dota to icefrog like 6 years ago and if you compared that game to now you could argue that it is a completely different game. The years Icefrog has presided over dota have also been by far the most successful (in terms of new players and competitive scene).<br />
<br />
You have to sympathize with Valve here. They are creating a game called DOTA 2 (they explained why they are calling it that) and if you are going to sink your company's time and money into something like this, you need to be able to control the name.</div></div><hr />

Not really man. DOTA is and was originally a custom map for Warcraft 3. Blizzard had nothing to do with it, other than providing the engine it was built on. The DOTA map is technically Blizzard's because it was built using their game, but they don't own the DOTA name, nor do they have a special claim to it.<br />

an example, If I was to make a warcraft 3 map and it just happened to be the most popular map ever on Bnet. Blizzard markets it, the problem is the map title was my first name.

You obviously didn't read any of the guide there. There are SEVEN separate pages to each guide. What you looked at was the first page which says &quot;Quick Guide&quot; there are 6 more tabs at the top of the guide with TONS of info for each Champion. Try using your eyes a bit.<br />

Regardless its was made by using Blizzard's In World Editor and it was stated that anything that comes from that In-World Editor is theres regardless you couldn't play DOTA unless through Warcraft 3 thats a Blizzard game and Valve can't Trademark the name cause it has been in assoicated with Blizzard for 7 years no other company can use it without having Blizzard's permission, i bet if Valve asked they would prbly would of let them use it but they tried to sneak by with it andPlus Riot Games is on Blizzard's side and so are the creators of HoN, no one should be able to use the name DOTA except Blizzard doesn't matter who made it, they prbly had a contract with Blizzard stating even though there the creators of DOTA, its part property of Blizzard (BTW i played DOTA when it released and on the front screen it had Blizzard logo and the original Battle.net Logo are on there) Valve better start brainstorming names soon, this a fight they cant win.</div></div><hr />

Valve doesn't own DotA they never worked on it, they should not be able to trademark it and call their game DotA 2.<br />

i technically never said blizzard, but punned on activision. it doesnt matter eitherway though i suppose. its hard to argue that valve is going to stifle further use of dota considering no one else was using it, the genre as a whole has moved on past that tag and you have different types of games within that genre. i was merely suggesting that in terms of fostering and promoting a community for a game, i'd think valve would be more true to them than blizzard.<br />

valve and much less icefrog trying to claim fame for DotA when the best any of them did was maintain it after, Guinsoo left to make LoL , is enormously arrogant and plain wrong.<br />
Valve doesn't own DotA they never worked on it, they should not be able to trademark it and call their game DotA 2.<br />
<br />
the only person who could ever claim to make a &quot;DotA 2&quot; is Eul the person who originally made DotA back in WC3: reign of chaos.<br />
<br />
God... Riot brainwashed you didn`t they? Riot uxsed Guinsoo to advertise their game. While he works for them his work on DotA was shorter and alot less glorius then Riot makes it to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eul was a Starcraft player and he created a wc3 mod based on Aeon of Strife, he called the new map Defense of the Ancients (DotA).<br />
He was very active in the modding scene and allowed others to create their own versions and call them DotA as long as one could tell them apart, when he stopped working on DotA he only wanted to be mentioned in the new maps.<br />
Two other modders (Meian and Ra1gor) created a DotA map which was called DotA-Allstars. Then The Frozen Throne was released and many maps stopped working. At that time Guinsoo started to look for unprotected DotA maps. He took Meian's DotA-Allstars and implemented several heroes from other DotA maps (Tides of Blood) without permission from their creators. He did not only steal the heroes but also the code from other maps. Many people in the modding scene hated Guinsoo because of that. The average DotA player didn't know or care though so Allstars became the most played DotA map. After one year (fall 2003 - fall 2004) of Guinsoo leading DotA-Allstars he vanished after posting a couple of rage threads, that was just after DotA-Allstars.com went online. The map was about to lose its popularity because of the lack of updates at that time. A friend of Guinsoo (Syllable) released a last update implementing Syllabear before a new modder called Neichus took over. A lot of the coding was already done by IceFrog now (who never worked together with Guinsoo). Neichus was the first to implement tooltips and icons (imagine no tooltips or icons for all items up to this point) but he stopped in Feb 2005 and IceFrog took over completely. IceFrog released 6.01, 5.84 was the last version Guinsoo had worked on. A russian modder called true.rus made a script that decreased the loading time from several minutes to ~30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Eul worked also on anotherDotA map called Thirst of Gamma but then vanished again.<br />
<br />
Pendragon never worked on DotA he only hosted the DotA-Allstars.com website.<br />
<br />
What has blizzard done for DotA?<br />
Nothing at all. They hosted a few tournaments but nothing significant. They increased the map size restriction in the wc3 engine so that the DotA map could use more resources. That's it. Blizzard has never done anything for DotA.<br />
<br />
-According to GabeN Eul also works for Valve (not neccasarily on DotA though).<br />
-Neichus work for DotA was probably more important than Guinsoos.<br />
-Guinsoo didn't create DotA:Allstars. Meian and Ra1gor did.<br />
-Guinsoo did not much more but ripping of other peoples work.<br />
-Oh and DotA lost it's Allstars postfix soem time ago.<br />
-When Guinsoo did soem workj himself it soemtimes ended up super shitty! Take a look at Astral trekker!<br />

As said before, Blizzard has no claim what so ever in this story, the only thing they can come up with is that DOTA ran as a conversion of Warcraft 3, this alone doesn't make it theirs. There were and still is a lot of modifications for almost any PC game and no-one but the authors of that mod can claim the rights to that code. <br />
<br />
Blizzard never really cared about DOTA, they made a few map system changes and about two tournaments and nothing else. It's actually funny. <br />
<br />
VALVe actually supports their modding community, by employing them (see Counter-Strike, Left 4 dead, Portal) and not to mention Team Fortress 2 where everyone can make models of weapons, hats, maps, and if the community votes them up, they get put in-game or being sold on the TF2 store and the authors get actual money from it.<br />
So in my eyes, VALVe is the one supporting the PC community whilst taking but also giving, while Blizzard is mostly taking, especially lately with all their claims that everything you see/do/modify in their games belongs to them, with no benefit what-so-ever to the authors. <br />
<br />
It's like JCB or Caterpillar claiming rights to every building, bridge or road constructed with their tools. Just look how stupid this sounds, and this is how Blizzard sounds and it's wrong.</div></div><hr />

Odd that you say that, because I remember Guinsoo still being around then passing it over to Icefrog on the website when he said he would no longer be working on the map. This was when I was into DOTA, and people were all like. WTF Guinsoos passed it over to Icefrog. Hopefully he can do a good job! Now DOTA is a mess of a map with much needless unbalancing.</div></div><hr />

I'm also waiting for the talent update. Probably all the lvl 88 ones, monk abilities and what they progressed in the last 2 months with all the existing spells.<br />
Nearly 2 days passed since the tweet about the ongoing update. Blizz likes to troll us for sure. Why not talk about it when its ready? Waiting like this is painful!</div></div><hr />

Or, more likely: Blizzard does not want Valve trying to steal something that technically already belongs to Blizzard as anything created with their map creator is their property. And Blizzard wants DOTA to remain connected with THEM. I can guarantee you that once both games came out, Valve would have tried to sue Blizz to have sole ownership of &quot;DOTA 2&quot;, Blizz is just beating them to the punch.</div></div><hr />

Where he works now is immaterial. He's never copy written it, obviously, so even if he does work with Valve on the project they'll have a tough time claiming anything.I'd love to see Valve's response to any line of questioning involving &quot;What is DotA 2 a sequel to?&quot; They seriously should have just changed the name ... and maybe the character models a bit ... I mean, seriously?Valve would do best to just tuck their tails between there legs and just release their copy-pasted game. It's probably going to be much more fun than playing it on a 10 year old platform. Also Blizz's mixing different games together just kinda makes it look like a mess imo (ie. Thor vs Thrall).</div></div><hr />

It wasn't Blizzard at the time, it was Riot fighting Valve's attempt. We don't even know what Blizz did after they bought Riot, if they called of the trademark attempt or not.<br />

The point still stands, Blizzard wants the DOTA name to be public domain. If it stays public domains, not even Blizz can trademark it.</div></div><hr />

Just goes to show people never read the faq. Even better are the &quot;Never think ahead or think it through, just click and pay for mount&quot; crowd that are talking about Dragon Soul being boring and now being stuck paying for WoW and wanting to cancel until MoP. It's just like the old record/cd club deals - in the end you will pay. Seriously, wtf were you thinking? The entire expansion has sucked horribly and Blizzard suckered over a million people into paying for a year rain or shine. They even offered it at the END of the expansion, and people bought in. What, was Dragon Soul going to magically make the whole expansion worth it? What's the track record for last patch to next release? Normally 8 months to a year wait. They've nerfed every piece of raid content immediately after release. Now people are claiming &quot;fraud&quot; and that Blizzard &quot;changed the contract&quot;. Where did they change the contract? Did people decide to pay a FULL YEAR just to get the free D3, mount, and then charge the thing back when they didn't want to play anymore? Did they think it was really going to be released when it wasn't ready? Makes no sense and gives me more confidence that Blizzard's average customer is below average in intelligence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, technically speaking....no one is truly locked in. I seem to recall reading that you can cancel anytime and get your money refunded, but you loose your special mount, beta pass, etc. <br />
<br />
Also...even if you couldn't do that, you *could* theoretically do something bad to perma ban yourself. I'm not saying that is ethical, but you *could* if you really wanted out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, you're still wrong. Although it is Defense of the Ancients 2.. that is NOT the name of it. The name is Dota 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
To prevent confusion over capitalization, I'm just going to write Dota for the rest of the article. According to Valve's senior project manager Erik Johnson, &quot;When people talk about DotA they say Dota. It's kind of a word, at this point. For us it's just a word, or a brand name.&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giliandrix</div><div class="date">2012-02-14, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone that thinks Blizzard is doing the right thing, or hopes that Blizzard wins is sadly just misinformed. The only reason Blizzard is fighting this is because they're trying to destroy a game that will be successful regardless. DotA is the main reason people still even play/buy RoC/TFT, and they'll do anything to disrupt Valve's already successful game (even if it's in beta). Blizzard never had anything to do with DotA. They even went as far as to trashtalk DotA at one of the previous Blizzcons. Valve has IceFrog, who is the main reason DotA got so big and popular, and Euls the original creator, both on their team. It's just so obvious that a game that Blizzard never openly cared about or mentioned much (besides the negative) is suddenly &quot;the community's property&quot; and &quot;must be protected&quot;. Blizzard is extremely petty. If they can't win, they don't want anyone else to.</div></div><hr />
