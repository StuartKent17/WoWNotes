There's no way a damage buff with 100% leech for 30 seconds will make it to live. They would become gods in pvp</div></div><hr />

Well its a 10 minute cooldown and all 10min cds are already disabled in arena/BG just like paladins Lay on Hands etc.</div></div><hr />

I'm sort of fine with that, for a bit. They need to make a splash. Maybe not as big/long as DKs did, but not as soft as monks. It's not every expansion we get a fun new class after all.</div></div><hr />

I don't think anyone knows. There's nothing about Illidan being dead...and the screenshot of the quests from the Relics part is from Illidan.<br />
<br />
Maybe they mistook him referencing his first &quot;death&quot; as dying again?<br />
<br />
Never mind, it's definitely coming from Illidan's spirit, implying he's dead while you talk to him.<br />
<br />

<br />
Maybe this is before he's revived.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but there was the whole &quot;he's a demon so his soul doesn't really die&quot; thing.<br />
<br />
Also I updated the post, it does seem the quest I meant is from Illidan's spirit-<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/november/WoWGSP009.jpg<br />
<br />
He specifically says &quot;In life&quot;, implying he's not alive anymore.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I guess him saying his soul is stuck in the Twisting Nether means something too.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming it will be a questline to free him.</div></div><hr />

if you can equip it, you can use it...so if it a class only item, only characters of that class can use it<br />
<br />
&quot;real&quot; T3 is probably limited to that class only, the T3 from the BMAH should be any class that can wear that armor type</div></div><hr />

No but it's kinda lame that they didn't mention Shaman at all. And seeing as I've played Combat since Vanilla, never played Assassination or Subtlety cause it's my choice I'd like to know what they are doing to my spec. But whatevz I guess I'll have to wait a few more days or maybe it'll get addressed in Q&amp;A. Looking forward to see what Red Shirt pulls out of his ass this year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also I updated the post, it does seem the quest I meant is from Illidan's spirit-<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/november/WoWGSP009.jpg<br />
<br />
He specifically says &quot;In life&quot;, implying he's not alive anymore.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I guess him saying his soul is stuck in the Twisting Nether means something too.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming it will be a questline to free him.<br />
<br />
There's a point in the Starting Area, where you have to power some Legion engine of sorts with the death of a demon hunter. You can actually choose whether you sacrifice the NPC or yourself. If you sacrifice the NPC, the Quest tag is completed and nothing happens. If you sacrifice yourself, you will actually die and while you run back to your corpse, Illidan will explain to you, that you're just like him, Immortal. It confirms, that Illidan has indeed a demon's soul and returns to the Twisting Nether if slain. Same goes for the Player-character, only that you get the whole spin, that you can actually go directly into your corpse.</div></div><hr />

Not sure about the Shadow Priest stuff...don't really get into the whole tentacle thing, I like my Spriest the way she is. <br />

Pickpocket quests. Pickpocket is a thing again? Finally. <br />

I'll stop there. Looks good. Hope it all makes it into the game! And for all those demanding 'What did other expansions have that WoD doesnt&quot; - pretty much everything they're adding back in on this panel. In Wrath through MoP, there were many times I'd just log in, work on professions, do a little gathering, and chat with friends.

There is no possible way that a sentient being can come to that conclusion. Assuming all this makes it into Legion (and I think it will if they learned their lesson in WoD) then this is already the best expansion ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New raids - Came with a lot of patches in the first 3 iterations of the game. Guess you weren't around for that.<br />
<br />
Artifact system - So they added a small amount of talents back in since they removed them all in Cata. That's all artifacts really are.<br />
<br />
Entire new continent - They released Isle of Quel'danas in an emergency patch because WOTLK took too long. 5 zones over 2 years is absolutely shit.<br />
<br />
Transmog - Shit content is shit. The only people who care about transmog still dress up barbies.<br />
<br />
Profession - UI update. Literally nothing else.<br />
<br />
Class halls - Garrisons in Legion. Big surprise.<br />
<br />
PVP system - Zero balance changes and COD prestige. Very far off from TBC or WOTLK.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Queen of Hamsters</div><div class="date">2015-11-07, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">- Transmog - Clean up bank and inventory some more. More customization. A collection system.<br />
-Wardrobe - As soon as item is bound to you, appearance is unlocked. Once it is unlocked, you can get rid of it. Account wide! Have to be able to equip item to unlock it.<br />
- New transmog UI - Left side is the same as the old one, right side is visual gallery of models. Top has a bar that shows you how many appearances you have unlocked.<br />
- Outfits - Make item sets, store what you look like now, link outfits to other people even if everything isn't unlocked.<br />
- When you log in to Legion, all of the items you have are unlocked, as well as items from every quest you have ever completed, including items you didn't even pick.<br />
- Save different outfits per spec. Switch set when you switch specs.<br />
- You can hide slots (cloak / helm / shoulders) per outfit.<br />
- Hiding shoulders allowed!<br />
- Weapon enchants, shirts, and tabards for transmog!<br />
<br />
These changes...I feel like crying tears of joy... :')<br />
<br />
That SHOULD mean I can save time doing challenge modes with all my other characters then...got all the sets from MoP, got the weapons on 2 characters so far in WoD. I DO hope they'll allow challenge mode items to be account-wide!!</div></div><hr />

Artifacts - Have you used them yet? Have you seen everything they provide to you as a player, to your class, to the story, to how it forces you out into the world? You literally cannot make a judgment like that off what they've showen so far<br />
<br />
Entire new continent - Isle was a bunch of re-used art assests and models that were already in the game. It probably took a month, or less, to do it. It was nothing special. Each new expansion's zones get more and more in-depth, with even more to do, and with way more quality/amazing design. For example, look at some of WotLK's larger zones. Half of it was emtpy, useless space. In WoD, and what looks to be in Legion, 95% of the zone is used for some purpose and has meaning to it.<br />
<br />
Transmog - Was much overdue and needed, despite what you think. You may not be interested, by I'm sure over a million people are.<br />
<br />
Professions - Did you even see the panel? How can you say it's just a UI change? They are making professions way more useful and meaningful. Not sure what panel you were looking at. Clearly not this one.<br />
<br />
Class Halls - It's an upgraded, better version of Garrison's. It's what Garrison's should have been in the first place. It's not a &quot;sit in your base and play facebook games&quot; feature.<br />
<br />
PVP - Can't comment as I don't care for PvP</div></div><hr />

Only entirely new thing is the Artifact system/pvp system, Class halls are a spin off of garrisons.

If you're expecting some more mindblowing news after this weekend you're gona be disappointed.<br />
<br />
Did they list your new abilities or talents? Or how about the look of the bosses in the raids or dungeons? Yeah they wait and feed it out little by little. You are wrong. There is a prime example of news that will becoming in a few months. See all you complainers in Legion</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hamski</div><div class="date">2015-11-07, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Artifacts - Have you used them yet? Have you seen everything they provide to you as a player, to your class, to the story, to how it forces you out into the world? You literally cannot make a judgment like that off what they've showen so far<br />
<br />
Sure isn't stopping you from claiming it's going to be awesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
Entire new continent - Isle was a bunch of re-used art assests and models that were already in the game. It probably took a month, or less, to do it. It was nothing special. Each new expansion's zones get more and more in-depth, with even more to do, and with way more quality/amazing design. For example, look at some of WotLK's larger zones. Half of it was emtpy, useless space. In WoD, and what looks to be in Legion, 95% of the zone is used for some purpose and has meaning to it.<br />
<br />
Oh, right. An expansion about the burning legion that we've already seen all the main villains for isn't going to have any reused assets. You're in denial.<br />
<br />
<br />
Transmog - Was much overdue and needed, despite what you think. You may not be interested, by I'm sure over a million people are.<br />
<br />
A million people who will unsub after a month anyway. Blizzards problem has always been catering to the wrong group of players. Well, that and having devs who don't even play their game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions - Did you even see the panel? How can you say it's just a UI change? They are making professions way more useful and meaningful. Not sure what panel you were looking at. Clearly not this one. <br />
I did, and judging by how you can't even mention another feature of them in your rebuttal, I'm guessing we saw the same thing.<br />
<br />
Class Halls - It's an upgraded, better version of Garrison's. It's what Garrison's should have been in the first place. It's not a &quot;sit in your base and play facebook games&quot; feature.<br />
<br />
<br />
PVP - Can't comment as I don't care for PvP<br />
<br />
Not surprised.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Not A Cat</div><div class="date">2015-11-07, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far I'm most hyped about the transmog changes. I don't know what I'm going to do with all of those bank slots.<br />
<br />
I like some of the class changes. Although I feel like they missed the mark on some of them. For instance, fury warriors. IMO the only problem with fury is the RNG of bloodthirst. Unlucky lack of crits can really screw your dps. I mean, you can only have 2 stacks of Enraging Blow and 4 stacks of Meat Cleaver (but you only have to whirlwind twice) it's really nothing to manage. Personally, I think Fury was at its best in 5.4 when we had Colossus Smash, I had a lot of fun with it.<br />
<br />
And then Arcane Mages, I can't really say much about this since I don't play my mage often, but the reason I don't like them is because they're very boring. They need more buttons. Although that's just me, I could be off the mark because I've never raided neroics with them.<br />
<br />
But on the other hand, I'm so happy that hunters are getting a melee spec. Even if it does bring back bad memories of me going melee hunter when I first started playing this game. I missed mongoose bite. Also I like their point about guardian druids. They're giant ass bears! Shadow priests too. Although I hope they keep a lot of their abilities like mind flay, mind blast, mind spike, shadow apparitions, and I hope they rethink getting rid of shadow orbs. I like the idea of getting rid of their dots, but I think they should keep a lot of the shadowy, mind-manipulating kinds of abilities (if that makes sense).<br />
<br />
Overall, some decent changes, but I'm not a fan of the overall message that &quot;less is more&quot; with some of them</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure you don't understand what an asset is either; all of the demon models are remade, it's an entirely new zone, more voice overs than any previous expansion, and so on.</div></div><hr />

Remove LFR maybe even LFD (These tools have decreased the social aspect of wow which is one of the biggest ground pillars of an mmo. People dont need a guild anymore meaning less socialising -&gt; easier for people to quit-&gt; subscriber lose. My opinion is this undermines WOW as AH undermined D3)<br />
<br />
Remove Transmog (devalues gear)<br />
<br />
Reintroduce rating requirements for pvp gear (gives you carrot to actually to improve your gameplay)<br />
<br />
Reintroduce challenging outdoor content (Not just a few quests! Make people group up and face evil together! This is how you get friends in game and not through a stupid matchmaking system)<br />
<br />
If Blizzard would introduce these things they would get my heart beating again, but as it is right now this game is colder than a blizzard in Dragonblight.</div></div><hr />

I'm in denial? You're telling me that Isle of Quel'Danas is on the same level of quality and design that WoD's zones were and what Legions zones look like they are? If you think that, it's YOU who is in denial. Ignorance again.<br />

Probably will lose subs after launch. It always happens. Good riddance to the month long visitors. Im sure you'll be one of them and I'll be happy to see you go.<br />

I don't think you understand what bullshit is. No, the models are the exact same. Textures are different. &quot;Entirely new zones&quot; don't take 2.5 years to create. Voice overs? Do you honestly think voice overs are going to change how this game is played? Some of you are so delusional.<br />

All they showed of the artifacts is the talent tree attached. You have nothing to add that goes beyond this observation yet still say there's more like some junior Billy Mays. We can make a judgement because it's Blizzcon and that's all they showed. That makes it all there is.<br />

Hopefully, this is all the stuff that they are SURE will make it, and we might be seeing more stuff added eventually. If they learned anything from WoD, one lesson learned should be to not talk about and hype stuff that might not make it.</div></div><hr />

They already stated that there's class quests involved with artifacts, and beyond just getting it. It's also another way of getting colour variants.<br />

Sunwell yes. The Isle itself? No. Stop changing you're evidence everytime I counter it. We were talking about the zones, now suddenly you switched to the raid. I was referring to the zone itself. Holy moly.<br />

<br />
Remove Transmog (devalues gear)<br />
.<br />
<br />
1. You still need a guild to tackle the most challenging content, as always before. I distinctly remember constant &quot;puggers&quot; that wouldn't join guilds before LFR/LFD. Some people, like it or not, play MOSTLY for the game itself with a side of social. Others seek the activities needing more cooperative gameplay. If LFR hadn't come along, raiding would be a very different beast and NOT because all those people not motivated to raid properly would suddenly step up, but because Blizzard would have had to reduce time and effort spent on raids that only a choice percentage complete. Simple.As.That. Want to make friends? You're free to do so. If I can, anyone can. I want the social and cooperative gameplay, I seek out a guild. Having choices for stuff to do and ways to progress my alts that does NOT require my guild/friends to always be on hand, is also awesome. <br />
<br />
2. HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!!!!!!!1...*ahem*...sorry. Seriously though, how the FUCK does transmog &quot;devalue&quot; gear when it ACTUALLY brings a use for sets and looks that were only taking up bag space or deleted to clear bank space before...? And HOW does it &quot;devalue&quot; current level gear when transmog in no way impacts HOW you gain said gear...? To me, transmog has made gear more precious since I now have a reason to hold on to sets and pieces that I like the look of whereas before I would simply sell/delete pieces once better upgrades came along. So glad I held on to my Frenzystrike Longbow, since the source was later removed from the game.</div></div><hr />

Just to point out on your last two points; it was briefly mentioned during the panel that your highest rating (RBG or Arena) would be a factor in determination of what gear you get out of lockboxes, and the &quot;adventure mode&quot; objectives will include word bosses etc. that will require a team.</div></div><hr />

You say obviously a lot for using a lot of assumed information. I'm going to try it out. <br />
<br />
Obviously watching Blizzcon to see what they have planned for WOW is the idea.No one was impressed this year, but obviously, the few of you who were don't matter anyway. You'll play anything. WOW used to be amazing, but the last three expansions sucked ass. Obviously, they started catering to casual bads like Eliazer681. Obviously.</div></div><hr />

Obviously, you can reply to people without being a twat about it. Obviously. You should try it.<br />
You're literally whining just to whine, do you honestly have nothing better to do?<br />
<br />
Also, since everything that was announced this year was apparently just terrible... I'm curious, what would you have liked them to announce?<br />
Honestly, most of the things they announced are great. The only issue being that they should have already been in the game. But yea, enlighten us all on what you think would be better additions.</div></div><hr />

Seriously? What is wrong with you? No one impressed? My facebook is ON FIRE with excitement for WoW and I honestly didn't realise I knew ANYONE that was interested in the slightest in this game. Trade chat has been buzzing with positive remarks on my server and apart from right here on this site I haven't read anything negative(granted I only use this site for info).<br />
<br />
I really hope you know how pathethic you're making yourself look and is just trolling, trying to make everyone who enjoys the game feel horrible.<br />
<br />
Your opinion does NOT matter, simply because you're unable to act like a decent human being.</div></div><hr />

There's a lot of people in here with an opposing opinion, obviously. I don't just outright attack people. They're all entitled to their own opinion. <br />
<br />
Someone wants to call me a twat because I'm not impressed by what little content Blizz offers this year? Fuck 'em. The fact that they're excited over what TMorph has done for 10 years says enough about them as intellectuals. GG, your game is going to die because you refuse to demand good content from Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sunwell yes. The Isle itself? No. Stop changing you're evidence everytime I counter it. We were talking about the zones, now suddenly you switched to the raid. I was referring to the zone itself. Holy moly.<br />
<br />
K. You think it's a shitty game. A lot of people don't. You're here stirring up things why?<br />
<br />
READ. THE. PANEL. That is my argument. If you can't take 2 minutes to read the profession portion, get lost.<br />
<br />
Now you're just conceited as hell. Get off your high horse. A) As of now i raid 2 days a week for 3 hours. hardly addict material. B) what evidence do you have to prove I'm bad? Because you said so? Hah. <br />
<br />
And nah, I'm not a fan of hot pockets. I prefer pizza pockets.<br />
<br />
Jesus... I have been a lurker on mmo-champion for too many years now, but you are the first person dumb enough to make me want to create an account specifically to reply to a post. First off anyone who doesn't know the difference between you're and your shouldn't be taken seriously in the first place. <br />
<br />
Aside from that you are actually a bad player, you have been farming your ring as a Blood DK up until 770 something ilevel i think? and you just killed mythic reaver 4 days ago. I stopped raiding wod for obvious reasons in august and was 3x as far as you are with a 730 something ilevel ring and raided 2 days a week. I would consider this grounds for me to say, yes, you are in fact bad at this game. <br />
<br />
As if that wasn't enough, your 40th percentile parses for KRSI are more than impressive. I was hardly expecting 30th percentile from someone like you.<br />
<br />
Whether I agree with you or not about certain aspects of Legion that were revealed, every argument you tried to make with Hamski was done so in the poorest possible way I could have ever imagined.<br />
<br />
Well done sir, you are officially the worst player I've never played with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, the 'theme' rows were explained as the rows with three AoE's to choose from, or the speed buff tiers. They will be no more, but the choices will get mixed up, for the potential to pick 2 AoE's from different tiers, though that was not specifically stated.<br />
<br />
As for 'hundreds' of talents, there will be 36 specs with Demon Hunters, so if each spec got 6 new talents, that is over 200, and thus 'hundreds'. If each class got 16 talents, that would still be over 200, and thus still 'hundreds'. Technically, with the artifact trees they could count those as 'talents' too, but that would be twisting words, same with the PvP stuff. <br />
<br />
And lastly, sometimes 'hundreds' can simply mean over 100, so 121 'new' talents could count as 'hundreds', but that is not what I would call 'hundreds'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enlighten me, oh wise one. What constitutes good content? TBC which you apparently have an eternal hard on for was one giant, empty, bland contentless rock with the exception of Nagrand. It had a lot of dungeons, sure, but they were all the same. Each replaceable with the last they could have put in a placeholder box and it wouldn't have made a difference as long as it dropped differing gear. The raids weren't much better. Every single enemy was a recycled vanilla model. No shit they could release 5 raids and 15 dungeons or so when none of them had new art assets. They were literally copy/paste jobs. Outlands? In the damn game files LONG before the expansion was even announced. PvP? A broken as fuck mess. If you weren't one of the select classes that was viable, you might as well reroll or forget about PvPing.<br />
<br />
So please where is this immeasurable amount of content that Blizzard was apparently capable of back then that they don't bother with now? As someone who has played every single expansion, the ONLY expansion that has obviously been lacking was Cataclysm, and that's because they remade the entirety of Azeroth for re-leveling. MoP (and Legion from what we've seen so far) was the most content filled expansion. Great PvE, acceptable PvP (where all classes finally had at least 1 viable spec), countless new art assets, lots of new systems and play modes and replay value.</div></div><hr />

Or altaholics in general. Now I won't have to back through the leveling zones again on my main to get the newer quest transmog gear.</div></div><hr />

The artefact talent tree is just a talent tree linked to a weapon. The lore fluff and customisability is a nice bit of embellishment, though.<br />
<br />
DH could potentially be interesting, and I do like the fact that it is locked to BE and NE - and hope it remains so (but I'm aware it probably won't) - yet I have a suspicion they will make it OP as fuck, which would be a letdown, if it did transpire.<br />
<br />
Regarding demo, it has been overhauled so many times, that I hope this time they get it right. Arcane is in need of an overhaul, but I'm not sure that eclipsing mana management from the one spec centering around it and which still does it is a good idea. An arcane charge based mechanic would scarcely make it hugely different from destruction or any other spec using such a mechanism.<br />
<br />
Class halls do have some promise to be interesting, pending method of implementation.<br />
<br />
Overall, a lot of QOL changes but none of it is sufficient to motivate me to pre-order without further details.</div></div><hr />

Really? You're going to shit on the expansion with the most raids and dungeons? The one where flying was introduced? Where rated PVP was introduced? (Sorry, every class had a glad viable spec. Just because you weren't good doesn't mean the game sucked) Get butthurt. http://imgur.com/gallery/tMmpeGL<br />
<br />
There's a reason you've lost subs every expansion after WOTLK. It's because previous expansion's content was better.<br />
<br />
I get it. You're named Common Sense because you have none. Ironic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean the mobility options alone will make them gods in PvP, how the hell can anyone keep up with them in battlegrounds when they're flying all over the place and making jumps other classes cant? The power fantasy stuff with DHs, ridiculous legendaries and so on in this expansion screams to me they've just completely given up on balancing the game, which whatever, fuck it, it made D3 more fun maybe it can work for WoW.</div></div><hr />

I wondered about this, too. Although, if you're running old content, you can still LOOT the items, meaning they are &quot;bound&quot; to you. It mentions nothing about having to equip them. It will be harder getting xmog stuff on current toons but eh, you'll get it eventually.</div></div><hr />
