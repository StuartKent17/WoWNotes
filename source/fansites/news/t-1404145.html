Patch 5.4.2 - In-Game Store<br />
Patch 5.4.2 adds a new UI to the in game store that will support many more categories than are currently used. After placing an order, you will receive an email and addition to your Battle.Net transaction history, just like any other store order. <br />
<br />
Right now it is using the experience boost potions as a test item, which are only for sale in Asian regions. There have been no announcements to indicate this will be changing anytime soon.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
lack of tanks -&gt; tank can not do anything with shiny new tank gear besides raid. Make tanks be able to quest properly<br />
Tanks are pretty awesome at questing. Even healers aren't bad these days. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402650979041964032))<br />
<br />
what's a good fix then?<br />
Weaking temp stats boosts makes both the boosts and dot snapshotting less interesting. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402531927191613440))<br />
we don't like wild dps swings cause of uncontrollable rng why is this so hard to understand<br />
Neither do we. Dot snapshooting mattering so much was a major cause of this. &quot;On the pull&quot; uberness is another. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402558620555948032))<br />
We don't think the answer is no RNG though. Being able to react to RNG keeps combat from becoming rote and predictable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402558890128048129))<br />
<br />
Anything to say about classes being homogenized prior to MoP classes felt like they each had a niche, now it all feels similar<br />
I think that is fair, but too often before the answer was just bring X class and bench Y. We need a happy medium. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402558082405761024))<br />
<br />
I get you don't like the mod. Nevertheless, DoT specs are pointless when you remove snapshotting. No room for skill.<br />
I don't think you're understanding my point. The mod is what you seem to be calling skill. There really isn't much skill. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402554733673472000))<br />
If there was no mod and you had to learn from experience when to refresh, then I might buy it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402554871129202689))<br />
<br />
Any plans to reduce number of spells? Failed finger acrobatics is frustrating. Ignoring spells too. 10% too many?<br />
We would like to, but is a controversial proposition. Every spell is someone's favorite. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402537362757935105))<br />
<br />
Vengeance was a mistake from the start. Tanking never felt so boring in Vanilla/TBC as it does now. Threat should matter.<br />
Threat is only fun for the tank, not for the rest of the group who just feel throttled if threat is ever in question. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402511097040621568))<br />

and exactly how often does &quot;more DPS&quot; become optional when talking about guilds pushing players to minmax?<br />
If you die all the time from not moving out of stuff, then you are doing much less DPS than taking the talent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402652727450148864))<br />
<br />
How do you feel Focus has worked out for Hunters? It feels very, very short term for decisions. Mana let you plan ahead more.<br />
We like it overall, in that a resource that expires in an encounter feels bad for DPS. But we do like hunters resource driven. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402556103348609024))<br />
I think we were too generous with base focus return, which meant that at high gear levels you can ignore focus. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402556191974244353))<br />
<br />
Maybe I missed this, but is Snipe targetable or not? &quot;Carefully Line Up&quot; infers not.<br />
The intent is that it is targetable. The line up bit is just to explain why you can't move. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402534521263767552))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
are paladins ever going to get their auras back? they just feel like glorified warriors without them and it made them unique.<br />
In theory, perhaps. In practice you just picked Devotion Aura unless you were mounted or had a particular resistance fight. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402537947825586178))<br />
Overall, there are precious few examples where the &quot;pick one of this mode&quot; mechanic really works for classes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402538074120278016))<br />
Flavor over function. IMO, not everything about every class must be spreadsheet-approved.<br />
I agree, but the swing was quite large. In order for flavor &gt; function to work, the delta can't be as big as old Devo. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402556961910038528))<br />
Otherwise, it's not flavor. It's just playing badly. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402557127631187969))<br />
<br />
Hi, just asking out of curiosity, do you have any plans on putting Divine intervention back?<br />
No. It was very buggy and mostly seemed popular because it skirted repair bills, which doesn't feel very heroic. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402544537291071488))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U))<br />
Are you planning to revamp Shadow priests? Their kit needs a good review in 6.0 <br />
Pretty happy with them overall. We're open to things like banking orbs and removing games to start a fight with orbs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402540178553589760))<br />
In other words, we will polish the mechanics but don't think they need a massive overhaul. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402540245880557568))<br />
<br />

Do you feel the Rshaman stacked niche has worked finally? Can we expect this niche to stick going into WoD?;o<br />
They feel pretty good in 5.4 though we think Chain Heal was more fun when targeting mattered more. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402558437705269249))<br />

Play Warlords of Draenor at DreamHack Winter 2013<br />
We recently revealed (http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/blog/11499598/blizzard-at-dreamhack-winter-2013-05-11-2013) that we’ll be heading to DreamHack Winter 2013, which runs from November 28 to December 1 in Jönköping, Sweden. As promised, here are details on some of the exciting activities we’re organizing during the event. Those of you watching all the fun unravel from home can also take part!<br />

Aside from guarding our booth against any rogue magical attacks, Jaina will be there to greet those of you who are brave enough to approach her. We’ll also be sending her on numerous perimeter checks, so feel free to say hi if you see her on her travels around the halls. She’s a huge Hearthstone fan, so why not challenge her to a battle?<br />
<br />

Real BoA Heirlooms are in for Warlords unless you are talking about something else. The people working on the systems/UI are unlikely to be the people working on the new models.</div></div><hr />

That'd be somewhat correct if the same teams worked on those things.<br />
<br />
Except they don't.<br />
<br />
Not doing the &quot;cash grab&quot; will not change the release dates of the new models or the BoA cross-realm mailing/BoA page for WoD one BIT. Not in the slightest.</div></div><hr />

Actually I watched the full commentary of him for three arena matches the other day; the other two commentators were pretty serious the whole time and sort of just said 'certainly, absolutely' and didn't kind of go along with it.

In game store is for ASIAN REGION ONLY because they use a different economic model.<br />
And it's been already a great deal of time they use this system and they can buy XP boosts. They just added a new UI for the next patch. Period.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The shop will only sell everything that's already available for sale. The XP boost is only available in Asia and has been for some time.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has stated they feel like it would not fit well in America and Europe and have no plan to bring it in.<br />
<br />
Blizzard also stated they have no plans and haven't even discussed once moving the game to F2P, which would be moronic in a business standpoint and take loads of time to do that they couldn't bother wasting.</div></div><hr />

At least realize what they are selling there before you attack it.<br />
<br />
The in-game store is just an easier way to buy everything that's already available. If you were going to say you weren't going to resub you should have done so when they decided to sell the very first pet for real cash, not now that they are just making it easier.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard has stated multiple times they have absolutely NO intent of selling items you can get in game through hard work in the store.</div></div><hr />

Is it pay to win though? Not really, but it doesn't matter, any kind of cash shop in a subscription based game is a slap in the face, regardless if it's customization only. <br />
The fact that they are pushing it forward to add XP-boosts and even 90 lvl characters is hilarious.<br />

He said once he doesn't care much about transmog, yet lots of peoples love making their characters look badass. I think the same principle applies to spells, lots of players love cool spells, but GC only sees them in terms of how the spell functions in raids. I think its a fair criticism of him.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's really hard to understand why it is an epic fail if you give a class dots(slow damage), bad defense(cloth), and force it to stand still while casting(all except 1 dot).....and the only serious defensive spell is a self-silence. Slow damage+no defence+no ability to run...how could that be a bad combination???? Guess we need to resurrect Einstein to figure that one out...<br />
And then you let them face burst classes with bubbles and so on that can do lots of damage while moving. Congrats.<br />
<br />
<br />
Same counts for solo player PVE. Shadows have almost no working cc vs. rar-PVE-Mobs(compared to other classes) and they have no tank to absorb damage for them. If I hear that the rares in 6.0 shall be for small groups then that translates for me to &quot;small groups equal: 1 DK, or 1 Warlock, or 1 Hunter, or 1 Tank-druid, or 2 mages, or 2 whatever...or 5+ shadows&quot;. <br />
<br />
Fortunately this game is not about solo-pve or pvp....oh wait....that's exactly what we all spend most of our time with in this game.</div></div><hr />

Apparently Realm First achievements have been removed. Though we ain't entirely sure if it means ALL of them, or some (leaving e.g. raid boss kills)</div></div><hr />

And this is coming from Blizzard, who said the &quot;free to play&quot; model wouldn't work with WoW, but here they are, slapping in an in-game store where they can sell things like every &quot;free to play&quot; game in existence, but they can't do &quot;free to play&quot; because... yeah.. it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Exp boost is not P2W, also how do you draw a line between an in-game store and free to play? It wouldn't work, you know why? Because WoW is designed to be a subscriptions based MMO, turning it into free to play would kill the game. You know SWTOR right? A game designed to be subscription based turned free to play, so it died.<br />

Here's a defence for ya. You don't have to buy an exp boost, its optimal. Exp boost to get to lvl 100 (current 90) in order to start the real game is not P2W. Only available in Asia, because apparently that's how the Asian market works. The shop has existed for years just not in the game, why the sudden hate? I feel that the term &quot;fanboy&quot; is disrespectful and a bit racist, currently considering reporting your post. What's a PRs?

Present your argument on why you feel that their move is a bad idea in the long run. Because despite most people on this forum, I would like a nice conversation with actual fact and arguments. Not a &quot;fanboy vs anti-fanboy&quot; bash till the end of the world.</div></div><hr />

But it was OK with you when it was only in the Battle store? Otherwise you are about 5 ish years late to the &quot;hate on blizzstore train&quot;.<br />
Also I think pathetic is the wrong word here, EA is a pathetic company. Blizz is more of a &quot;We are greedy because we are the top dog&quot; kind of company. Also the century has only just begun. Its 2013, you have another 87 years for other companies to rise to the title.<br />

My friend don't despair. They will never sell gear or anything that will impact the competition in the late game (pvp or pve). You have to keep in mind that the actual game doesn't start until lvl cap. Also why not make something for the people with money to burn? Why do you think there are cars for $1.5 million or more? There's nothing wrong with it, as long as it doesn't get out of hand *cough* DLC's *cough*.</div></div><hr />

Grow up. This game doesn't revolve around your expectations of the game or the company. <br />
They already sell in-game mounts and pets AND transmog helms. Who cares if they make the store in-game. <br />
<br />
If you don't approve of the products then don't buy them. Leveling is already lightning fast. Does it really matter if someone levels faster than you? <br />
Reading MMO-Champ gets so sad after a while, reading all the people bitching about every little thing in existence about the game. People even complained that Blizzard didn't give 100% profits of the new mount/pet to charity. Like good lord. Least they give anything.</div></div><hr />

Asian WoW's subscription is hour-based. So you pay per hour. Frankly, i've seen so many people hate on the XP boost yet none of them related it to the hourly based subscription. All our sorrows, dungeons queues, travel times, coin farming, BG queues, they don't matter to us cuz we pay monthly. They pay hourly and such sorrows is a waste of their hours. It makes sense they're given the option to boost XP. I feel sad they have to pay for it even. Asia should get especially discounted prices, if XP boosts are extended worldwide.</div></div><hr />

Unless it is mandatory, there is no problem. Everything is 100% optional. Thus, the game store is fine. The majority of the players don't care or complain, but don't actually care because it doesn't affect them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's said that there are 7 basic plots in story telling. So if you break down anything far enough, you get down to the building blocks. When you said &quot;remove the fancy scripts...&quot; you are taking away the the things that differentiate those 7 basic story types. You shouldnt base your judgment of story telling based on stripping it down to the bare bones of the story, you should judge it on the execution of the writing.<br />
<br />
Now, that said, I will admit there is some derivative, boring and hack-job writing out there. I just try to remember that a lame sitcom isn't lame because it rely's on the &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; trope, but because the writers did not execute well on that trope.</div></div><hr />

Why would they go F2P? It doesn't make sense, don't you see that people are more than fine to pay the subscription fee while having the cash shop as well. Hell, they are even ready to defend Blizzard for implementing it. They don't realize that modern F2P games offer only customization and fluff in their stores too, there are hardly any Pay2Win games anymore. It's basically the same thing that Blizzard is doing, except they don't charge a subscription fee for it.<br />
Blizzard has the fanboys' blessing to double dip and they will continue to push it. It's the best of both worlds for them.</div></div><hr />

Nope. They'll start selling BIS gear soon and all of you will bend over and take it as you're bending over and taking everything else. I refuse to buy any crap in the store since I already pay a subscription, but I'm in the extreme minority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They sell items in the store since YEARS. And no, since then they didn't sell BIS-Gear yet. I and many others had set the red line there; even on the pot which will not be released in NA/EU. The only change is now that the items are now available ingame instead of visiting the website. So why should they sell BIS-Gear when WoW isn't going for P2W; at least in NA/EU. The PR would be horrible, this enough makes it too bad.<br />
<br />
I think this change might be not directed to us, but maybe to the asian-market. There it may be that WoW is going Free2P(l)ay. So an ingame-store might be directed in this direction. But no, for us there might be some vanity-items, but nothing that change the gameplay itself. Pets, mounts, transmogs or other fun items, but nothing that change the gameplay.<br />
<br />
---EDIT---<br />
<br />
And like they already said: modern F2P-Games aren't Pay2win anymore: even there vanity-items are enough for the buisness model to work (sadly there aren't a lot yet) but even then i doubt that wow is going F2P in our region: more that WoW goes F2P in Asia.</div></div><hr />
