Grim Batol &quot;Vehicle&quot; combat<br />
Just to clarify, it's not vehicle combat at the beginning of the dungeon. The forces of the Twilight's Hammer within Grim Batol are massive, so you'll start the dungeon with a bombing run through the halls to thin their ranks. It'll be a set flight path and will not involve aerial combat. This is only to get things started. This dungeon is not vehicle-driven at all. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25482319093/cataclysm-preview-grim-batol/))<br />
<br />
Lack of class changes in Patch 3.3.5<br />
Our systems team is hard at work tweaking classes, updating talent trees, and restructuring the way in which new spells and abilities are learned during the leveling process (given that spells and abilities will scale with level rather than have multiple ranks). These changes are planned to coincide with a future patch which will implement the framework for Cataclysm. No major tweaking is planned to take place beforehand unless serious class gameplay issues arise. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25482318925/patch-3-3-5/))<br />
<br />
Leveling Curve in Cataclysm<br />
As you mentioned, the leveling curve all the way from 1-70 was adjusted in the past. We feel those changes coupled with heirloom experience bonuses make for a reasonable leveling experience up to 70. Since we're making major changes to the 1-60 Azeroth zones in Cataclysm, it isn't likely we'll be making further adjustments to the leveling curve there. The goal is to encourage new and old players alike to try out a new race or class and experience all of the new content and environment changes in the &quot;old world.&quot;<br />
<br />
As it is, Cataclysm will bring about a much better quest flow, both in terms of the way quests are given in individual zones, as well as the way in which players will be directed from zone to zone. It will be completely reasonable in Cataclysm to level from 1-60 in Azeroth solely on Kalimdor, or solely on Eastern Kingdoms. In general, there will be much less need to jump from continent to continent because you hit dry spots while questing and need to find somewhere else to go in order to find level-appropriate quests. The goal is to make sure players are given the choice to go to the zones they want to while leveling, rather than force them to the other end of the world for a level or two.<br />
<br />
Whether or not any changes are going to be made to the leveling curve in Northrend, or additional changes made to leveling in Outland, remains to be seen. We do want to ensure that the leveling experience from 1-85 isn't too daunting. That is a lot of levels after all. Once we have the Cataclysm leveling zones from 1-60 and 78-85 fleshed out, we'll more closely evaluate the full leveling experience during our beta test.

Think of the Durnholde keep caverns of time, you flew a dragon to the raid instance. It'll be like that but you'll get to drop bombs and take out some enemies to make it easier for you to get through the trash. Thats what it sounds like. Probably an achievement to take out x amount of mobs, and to keep all mobs alive then clear instance.</div></div><hr />

I seriously doubt they will implement a system like that. It will most likely have the same amount of mobs however well you bomb the place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Takes about 2 hours per level dude. My mage is level 76 atm and will be 77 before I finish up in Dragonblight - I entered Northrend at level 68 too!<br />
<br />
If they cut Northrend levelling by 30%, with heirlooms, you're going to be hitting 80 as you enter Grizzly Hills and potentially miss out on a lot of cool quests if your goal is to hit 85 asap in Cata.</div></div><hr />

How does 70 to 80 take forever. Imo 1 to 60 takes the longest for me because its the most boring since you don't have any cool spells to do big pulls. Hopefully since blizard is changing up that 1 to 60 zone it won't be as boring</div></div><hr />

I wish i was new to WoW, as i HATE lvling now. But thats because i have 6 lvl 80's. If i was new, this would be an amazing lvling experiance.</div></div><hr />

Wow boub the site is really fast now. Please keep it like this :D.<br />
<br />
Also - this is a minor annoyance, but would it be possible to change the post &quot;header&quot; (the sliver of space with your name on it that separates the posts) to a more noticeable color? The beige color really blends in the the main color of the forums so it's hard to differentiate between posts at a glance.<br />
<br />
EDIT: hrmmm... I just looked at the forums and it appears to be showing correctly if you navigate through the forums, but if you click &quot;comments&quot; on the main page, the layout of the post is way different than that if you navigate through the forums.<br />
<br />
would it be possible at all to change the link for &quot;## comments&quot; to something like this:<br />
<br />
http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/727446-Cataclysm-Screenshots-Blue-posts<br />
<br />
so it brings us to the forum instead of just refreshing the main page?</div></div><hr />

Agreed, not because I don't like the front page being refreshed to show additional comment on a news post but because the &quot;Recent News/Forum Post&quot; section of the main page seems to become intertwined between the first post. Something that didn't happen until yesterday and while your at it possibly fix the Advertisement/Recent Post issue on the front page. I know some of the Moderators would lead us to believe it's an issue with AdBlock but it happens in Chrome, IE8, Safari, and Firefox(Only one with the AdBlock extension all the others I run without Images being loaded most the time).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Calm down with the conspiracy theory. The bug was the result of a couple of changes to move the ad around and make it look less lame, and incidentally most of the people affected use AdBlock. Mods don't have access to the code and just repeat what I say, don't start attacking them. <br />

Although Greg Street said in a recent interview for gametrailers (I think) that alpha was coming along well and they were looking to get it into beta as soon as they got resources and such sorted for each class, like hunters with focus. So that is one piece of good news amongst the axing of a lot of the expansions features and the pretty crap screen shots of dwarf females and donkey's. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they cut Northrend levelling by 30%, with heirlooms, you're going to be hitting 80 as you enter Grizzly Hills and potentially miss out on a lot of cool quests if your goal is to hit 85 asap in Cata.<br />
<br />
It takes more than 2 hours per level in Northrend with heirlooms. People don't care about doing the content again. Even Blizzard admits that people don't quest in many parts of Outland. They'll have to boost XP in Northrend to make up for the increased XP it takes to get from 80-85. Leveling a new toon from 1-85 would be miserable if they didn't adjust the curve and added five huge levels on top of it.</div></div><hr />

Because you don't know how to read your whole 2 new spells and spam them? But, of course, you know the whole rotation of your class. On Malygos you just spam 2 buttons (given by your role) and get out of the &quot;fire&quot;. In Oculus, you do the same, the only difference is that the &quot;fire&quot; will follow you for 10 seconds.</div></div><hr />

Remember vanilla WoW how long it took to get to 60? I needed around 13days played to get to 60 on my first char (without beta xp).<br />
1-60 and 60-70 is already nerfed enough, i dont think it needs further adjustments.<br />
I mean you can leave Outland already around end of Nagrand, even if you came to Outland with 58.</div></div><hr />

Dude just as previous raid tiers get taken out of the spotlight nobody wants to spend forever leveling in Northrend again when they create their new toons. Of course experience required to get from 70-80 is going to and should be cut down a bit, if only to balance things out so that people actually keep questing in Northrend to level up, instead of simply doing bgs.</div></div><hr />

Levelling is my favourite part of the game (as i dont have to commit large chunks of time, dont have to rely on other players and can challenge myself how i wish. If i want to attempt to pull 8 mobs in one go to see if i can cope, i can without people having a go at me. I love developing my character, picking talents and learning new abilities too. I enjoy all of the above more than raiding.)<br />
<br />
If all these new quests/abilities/talents are being introduced into revamped areas, i would definately like the 1-60 experience to be longer. Im going to be starting from scratch on a new server just to go through the levelling process with each character. <br />
<br />
Oh, and i dont use heirlooms either. They are my most hated feature of wow (everybody has one) and i will never buy or use any heirloom item the way they are currently designed. I would much rather just buy consumable rest tokens than have super gear that is ridiculous for my level and wont ever be taken off due to the xp bonus. PVP heirlooms are just plain retarded.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you were/are bad at controlling vehicles.I am very good with vehicles, however not everyone is. Let me explain ... You spend 80 levels learning your class, learning spells, rotations, tricks to gain you a dps advantage. Then you walk into Oculus and none of that matters, because you only have 2 spells, or 3 vs last boss. Im pretty sure about 50% of people who pick the dps drake even know when to use time-laps, or know what the new spell on your toolbar does. Even the tank battle at the stRT OF Ulduar gets boring when you do it 4 times a week for months.<br />

Personally I agree with you to some extent. From leveling using heirlooms, I've found it far less exciting when it comes to loot drops from instances. If you have heirloom shoulders/chest/weapons/trinkets, that's alot of cool loot your going to have to pass on along the way and for me the game is alot about the loot. I've already decided i'm not going to use heirlooms in cata. Sure, most people i group with will have them, but that just increases my chances of getting all the cool loot for my lvl along the way!</div></div><hr />

yeah thats a good way of looking at i suppose (a positive way to see more gear dropping for me) personally like you say i love gearing up my char, items dropping in dungeons or from quest rewards are a massive part of levelling, but the heirloom gear is SO powerful it makes gearing up seem pretty pointless. A big thing that annoys me is i go into a random dungeon group with dungeon blues equipped, difficult to earn quest rewards and maybe a strong piece of gear that i bought with my hard earned money from the AH, and someone else outgears me and shows off their 'amazing' gear that was earned by their level 80.. then i end up struggling to compete as a strong party member because everyone else is OTT geared with heirlooms lol. <br />
<br />
I like your positivity about it though, and its good to hear someone else feels the same way. I just wish they would allow you to buy some form of 'rest token' with your level 80 emblems. I dont want to buy gear, i love getting that along the way. But what i do hate is bringing out say my level 42 warrior, really really enjoy playing as him, then he hits level 44, his xp bar goes to purple and i have to play as someone else because xp is then really slow. Its annoying having to swap from a character when i really start to enjoy and understand how they work lol.<br />
<br />
Going back to general levelling talk, i really hope they dont make regular/outland/cata any quicker. Already as things are you are finished with outland before netherstorm. I dont think people should have to do every last quest, but it would be nice to go around and get a feel for all the areas and enjoy them, rather than having to move on because im levelling too fast. I guess not many people enjoy the levelling process as much as i do though, so it looks like it may be made a smaller part of the game. :(</div></div><hr />

Do you seriously think people think its hard? I mean cmon.<br />
<br />
It just takes time, to much time in many ppls opinion which makes it booring. I agree, lvling is booring, i like the raiding and the PvP at 80, not the lvling and the lvling takes way to much time. It's not like its hard, just booring</div></div><hr />

<br />
Old world is much more hit and miss, you can find a ton of quests in one zone while the next may only have 5 or 6, and generally speaking the old world zones have quests and goals spread out all over the place making questing a slower process, not to mention that very few old world zones have tie in quests that lead you to the next zone you should be visiting. For those of us that have done it all for years its not a big deal, we know where to go, but that doesnt mean its the way to do things, and im glad to see they are working on it.</div></div><hr />

I don't like the whole speed leveling, heirlooms, and all that jazz. I level my characters the hard way, I take my time. To me if they speed up leveling through 70-85 I will be upset because I won't feel like I will be missing out on a lot of cool quests and storylines. <br />
<br />
Also I don't mind vehicles, they mix things up a little. I find them fun and don't complain.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2010-06-20, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think leveling from one to sixty is fine (in terms of experience points needed), it's just the ability to get said experience points that's messy. Since Blizzard has stated that old world quests will be getting some much-needed cleanup for Cataclysm, I'm not dreading nearly as much the leveling process like I did for my level 80 alts (currently working on number eight).<br />
<br />
Additionally, I think that Blizzard does need to reduce the amount of exp. for the level 70-78 range when they release their third expansion. By how much is debatable, but I will gladly accept whatever is deemed appropriate even if it's only 12,000 less per level.<br />
<br />
There has also been some talk here regarding the use of heirlooms, so I thought I would just add my two cents on it: I don't begrudge or think less of those who prefer not to; if anything, it'll mean seeing less loot getting vendored or disenchanted. I am electing to use heirloom items for Cataclysm, though, because it is (for me) a hassle trying to get so much gear for a character alt who levels quickly enough on its own that the aforementioned gear becomes useless too soon. The less gear I need to worry about, the more relaxed I can be. Also, I like the outfits that my Tauren paladin and Goblin warlock will be wearing.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I enjoy vehicle combat to a certain degree. It's fun getting to do it while questing, but when it's Oculus or Eye of Eternity that's involved... Don't get me wrong, I like those instances but I just don't believe that vehicle combat should be such a do-or-die necessity.</div></div><hr />
