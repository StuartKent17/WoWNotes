Warlock Ember System<br />
How does Destruction’s Ember system work?<br />
Basically, you build embers with some spells, and then spend those embers with Soul Fire, Ember Tap, or Fire and Brimstone. <br />
<br />
Internally, this is how it works:<br />
<br />
Immolate – DD + DoT on the target<br />
Incinerate – generates 1/10th ember, or 2/10ths if it crits an immolated target.<br />
Fel Flame – generates 1/10th ember, or 2/10ths if it crits an immolated target.<br />
Conflagrate – triggers Backdraft and has a 12 second cooldown.<br />
<br />
Soul Fire – consumes one ember instead of mana.<br />
Fire and Brimstone – costs 1 ember and has no cooldown.<br />
Ember Tap – costs 1 embers.<br />
<br />
Each full ember costs 0.33% of your maximum health per second. If you stay below 1 ember, you take no damage. <br />
<br />
How does chaotic energy work?<br />
We are experimenting with a resource-driven, rather than time-limited, caster model on the Destruction warlock.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, Destruction warlocks are not GCD locked. In fact, chain-casting spells as a Destruction warlock is less important than spending all of your resources.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this is all subject to change, but here is how Destruction flows at the moment:<br />
<br />
Start of Fight: Full mana bar, Empty Ember bar<br />
<br />
1. Immolate the target<br />
2. Conflagrate to trigger emberstorm<br />
3. Incinerate to generate embers<br />
4. Continue until you are low on mana<br />
<br />
Middle of Fight: Empty mana bar, ~2 Embers<br />
<br />
1. Soul Fire<br />
2. Soul Fire<br />
3. Mana bar is mostly full (Soul Fire costs embers, so your mana refills during the Soul Fires)<br />
<br />
In addition to increasing your base mana regen, Chaotic Energy increases mana regen even more with Haste. This means the ability to cast spells scales smoothly with gear.<br />
<br />
As long as the warlock never lets her mana bar fill up and burn her embers, she's maximizing damage. This is very different from the standard caster model where priority is placed on casting at all times and ordering spells based on cooldown.<br />
<br />
Our hope is that the Destruction Warlock will attract players who are interested in a playstyle that rewards spending resources at the right time, rather than constantly casting.<br />
<br />
How does Destruction’s Mastery work?<br />
Emberstorm increases the effectiveness of all Ember consuming spells. Soul Fire deals more damage. Fire &amp; Brimstone deals a higher % of the base spell’s damage. Ember Tap heals for more.

Development Time Cutbacks<br />
Blizzard severaly reduced the number of people on WoW development teams in last few months, which explains the simplifying of various aspects of the game. They don´t want to spend too much time tuning bosses, so they simplify the player, for example.<br />
I have no idea where you got this information from, but it's wrong. We're not simplifying various aspects of the game, we're constantly reviewing them to ensure they're fun, which can actually sometimes mean making them more involved. Also, we spend however long is necessary to tune bosses to make them engaging and challenging, we're not cutting back on that at all.

Due to the potency of Mages, guilds are ensuring that they're given to their Mage for maximum DPS benefit. Guilds are less likely to give Dragonwrath to one of the more underperforming caster DPS specs in comparison if they have other candidates like Mage that become borderline god mode with it.</div></div><hr />

That, and there are a lot of guilds out there that told their shamans &quot;caster shamans = shield&quot; as a reason for not getting it, first or even second at least. Even though it's BiS, it's likely the same guilds that screwed their ele shamans and boomkins out of having a fair roll on the only (I think it was) 277 caster belts and boots before Ruby Sanctum came out, saying clothies got priority even though there were no leather or mail equivalents for shamans or boomkins to be rolling on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just because someone is a hybrid spec and can heal, doesn`t mean they ever will heal, I think ele shamans are one of the best with the staff because of their mastery personally but meh, that is a good reason, but mages and shadow priests do stupid damage compared to any hybrid.</div></div><hr />

if you remove the pvpers/alts/casuals etc this is actually quite a big number. Divide this by whatever the number of &quot;serious&quot; progression guilds out there, and I imagine it basically represents at least 1 for every 10m and 2+ for every 25m guild. Essentially, whoever &quot;needed&quot; one (i.e. mages of semi/hard-core guilds) pretty much has one, and even boomkins/eles got a chance to get them since everyone else got it</div></div><hr />

Is there some information how many of that 5,6 Million are actually speccs that can use DTW? I know it might not be that accurate to take just a snapshot of what people are specced in the armory, because Balance Druids, Shadow Priests and Ele shammys could be on their second specc, but that pretty much evens out that some people might be on their 2nd specc not having DTW equipped when you were scanning for the 15000 DTW in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you didn't feel bad for Shaman already, you haven't been paying much attention to them this expansion. Resto in Arena has been the one thing we've been particularly good for. No-Shaman kills of end-tier bosses were all the rage last year. Elemental was way behind in T11 and going into T12 (i.e. when everyone picked the first, and for most 10mans, only legendary recipient). Shortly into T12, we got a pretty significant buff, and were nearly strong, but still by most metrics the worst caster class to receive a legendary.<br />
<br />
This tier, we're kinda alright, if we have it, but on average (raidbots), we're sitting in the basement for single-target DPS with Boomkin.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the graph, Chaud. I'd have thought Ele might take an upturn around the release of Dragon Soul, when serious 10man groups were finishing their first non-Mage staff (when I got mine), but I guess not. Fifty a week for Shaman, two-hundred and fifty a week for Mages, pretty regular.<br />
<br />
It's what we get for only paying $5.99 a month though. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Druids, priests and shamans only have one spec each benefiting from the staff, while the total number of people playing each class is similar to the total number of mages. And even for the people playing mostly elemental shaman, moonkin or shadow priest, it must be the case that a significant number of them fill in as healers when needed, which may lead their guilds to give legendary to a full time dps'er, so it will be utilized all the time, rather than most of the time. My impression is that there are relatively few full time elemental shamans, and that's not necessarily just because of the state of the spec, but also due to resto shamans being strong, and due to past history (many may have rolled their shamans back when practically all shamans were healers, because it was considered the only feasible spec, and stuck with it after learning the 'trade'). As for warlocks, it has always been one of the least played classes, even during the times when it was arguably the strongest dps class, for whatever reason (maybe simply due to being less 'iconic' in the fantasy tradition?). All else aside, there are just more total full time dps caster mages than there are of any of the other classes, I wouldn't be suprised if the ratios of the class of people with the staff quite closely reflects the number of people playing each relevant spec fairly closely.</div></div><hr />

Because they've been one of the most clunky and inconvenient casters for a long time now when you compare them to the relative ease of mages who can put practically zero effort into the game with a challenging 2-button rotation and come out as essentially the best caster dps of all, as well as the fact that they likely have one of the biggest/deepest gulfs between being sucky/mediocre in their DPS and being pretty good. I'm certainly hoping this is resolved in MoP but I won't count my chickens just yet.</div></div><hr />

For a legendary that &quot;everyone&quot; has, that's not that many. <br />
<br />
Going by the unscientific method of 'how many parses has WoL seen in the last week of your class?', we have:<br />
<br />
14300 Mages<br />
9244 Warlocks<br />
9998 SPriests<br />
5548 Boomkins<br />
5283 Elementals<br />
<br />
That's Ultraxion parses, normal and heroic, ten and twentyfive. <br />
<br />
For 44,373 total casters who log. Now, the big hole in the data is 'well, not everyone submits logs', and I don't know what that percentage is (somewhere around 15-20%, based on WoWProgress # of guilds that have killed Madness/Ultraxion tank parses/2). But there's a ballpark of the active caster balance at least. Some guilds have more than one raid group too, so there's that. <br />
<br />
If it's 20% of guilds worldwide that parse, and the Dragonwrath data are more or less complete, and the parses are representative (class-wise, of everyone who raids), then <br />
<br />
7.5% of raiding Mages have Dragonwrath<br />
7.3% of Warlocks<br />
6.1% of Shadow Priests<br />
6.4% of Balance Druids<br />
3.2% of Elemental Shaman<br />
<br />
Can get some other interesting data out of that statistic too. Seven of Eight heroic 10mans have a Rogue this tier. The average heroic 10man has 1.56 Paladins and 1.33 Druids.<br />
<br />

I understand that those who are currently playing Destro will not likely accept the change quietly, but in reality I applaud Blizzard for trying to create a caster spec with a different sort of resource system and playstyle. There are enough caster specs that it is nice to see them trying something different with one of them. Yes, retooling a spec to this extent will cause some balance issues and I'm sure through the first tier of MoP there will be constant nerfs/buffs, but if they can sort it out by the end of that tier, I think Destro will be more interesting to play. That said, I would like to see one of the Warlock specs remain something that could be more frontloaded as it gives more opportunity to match your spec to specific fights. I don't see why a resource system like this can't still provide good burst potential though.</div></div><hr />

That makes sense, but Life Tap is a much more controllable mechanism for when you're taking damage. It's on command, and you can time it or offset it with other methods. Always having to worry about a constant stream of damage seems counterproductive. Isn't that the reason they did away with the Seal of Blood for paladins?</div></div><hr />
