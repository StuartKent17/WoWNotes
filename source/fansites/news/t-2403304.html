Blue Tweets<br />
General feeling seems to be that Legion had solid content drip, but maybe 7.1 was a little too fast. That said, is there anything you'd change about the content per patch? If you could swap X for Y. I.e. &quot;7.X could have used a ___, I would have swapped that for ___.&quot; (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/998371454755291138))<br />
<br />
Which legendary is your favorite re: acquisition? We've had a lot of them, from a hammer and sword and staff to a bow and glaive to a hammer again and an axe to a cloak etc. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/998432739173875712))<br />
<br />
Will completing the campaign with both an Alliance and Horde character be required for Pathfinder Part 1 achievement?<br />
No. In Battle for Azeroth, you'll only need to complete one of either the Horde or the Alliance campaigns to earn the Pathfinder Part 1 Achievement. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/998986215670956032))<br />
<br />
you mentioned in an interview awhile back that you guys were looking at what to do with pet stables. Any news?<br />
Nothing to share yet, sorry! Realize this is a big deal to hunters though. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/999473762482319360))<br />

Seconded, mostly it's excessive bloom and color intensity. Faces got an overhaul as well, especially in the case of the blonde Alliance soldier not for the better.<br />

ayyyy what? watch the side-by-side at full screen and you'll see the models are completely new. I don't know anything about how this works but my assumption is this is a full recreation with new/different art assets.</div></div><hr />

You can obviously tell it's redone with the new models and stuff, but it's nothing special i.e. nothing blows my mind away personally, with the most notable being just a shxt ton of blood effects and recolouring. <br />

So unless you're doing something at the very best level is not worth doing? How are people supposed to improve without doing stuff?<br />

You must have a great life with that shitty attitude. Just pathetic.</div></div><hr />

LOL you are giving him too much credit for the instagram filters. Its more like a yellow color overlay and new models and they call it remastered... LOL<br />
<br />
It's the same with everything they put out now a days.</div></div><hr />

Tbh. When I read &quot;remastered&quot; I expect something that's literally going to blow my ass off and go beyond what's current, not literally just a rehash with some bloom.</div></div><hr />

Beside, he's done that just some time after his last big machinima, so i think he didn't take much time, it was just for his fans, not for some mmo-champion gourmets critics.<br />
<br />
I'm ok about the fact it's not that transcendental video like naxxramas the new trailer or something like that, but dont expect mind blowing video each week,n it take time (especially when youre not paid for) :p<br />

And beside, if he's doing a wrathgate remastered, you will cry from happiness.</div></div><hr />

He's re-creating the entire Warcraft 3 campaign in the WoW engine as cinematics. It's a much bigger upgrade than a reskinned trailer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2018-06-11, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The guy recreated the original ZA trailer with the new assets in the game. It shows how far things have come over the last 10 years. Were you expecting the guy made entirely new content for the game? That wasn't the point to the trailer. It's no different than Blizzard updating old zones or models. They're not going to do anything massively drastic because it's an update, not an overhaul. For those that don't like the trailer update, then it wasn't for you. Not everything has to be for everyone. I don't personally watch machinima stuff but I realize what the video was trying to showcase. No, it doesn't showcase anything new per se, but it does show updates to the game between when ZA first came out and now.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard does a return to Northrend expansion which I suspect will be after BfA, I can see people whining about all of the &quot;rehashed&quot; zones without taking note of how they've been updated from when they first came out. Sometimes it's the small things that matter but often go overlooked.</div></div><hr />
