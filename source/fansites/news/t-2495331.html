Oceanic WoW Classic Realms<br />
We agree with the many WoW Classic enthusiasts in Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia that it will be a very good thing for players in that part of the world to connect to realms that are hosted in that part of the world.<br />
<br />
Planned it all along!<br />
<br />
We will have Oceanic realms for WoW Classic, with game servers hosted in Australia, at launch on August 27, and we’ll let you know the names of the Oceanic realms before name reservations start on August 13. Thanks!<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW Classic “Not A Bug” List Update<br />
I’ve updated the original post in this thread with:<br />
<br />
<br />
“Melee leeway” is working as intended.<br />
<br />
<br />
After careful study and testing, we’ve found that for players with low latency, the state of melee leeway is how they would have experienced the game in 2006.<br />
<br />
There are more people with low latency now than there were in 2006, so we expect for some it might feel different, but it is working as expected.<br />

<br />
EDIT: looked at the map and it seems to be a mix of post Cata and original Warcraft.... weird. Look at the crack on the borders of Dun Morogh for example.and the giant lake in the Wetlands which only appeared there after the dam burst.<br />
<br />
Also I kind of like how Redridge, Searing Gorge, Blackrock Moutnain and Badlands are kind of all blend here. And love the Obsidian Forest mention too, before it was burned down.<br />

I hope you are being sarcastic, but in any case, this stuff very likely belongs to Legendary Pictures, the production company that actually made the movie, not Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

I know this is a joke, but on a serious note: Wouldn't these things be sold by the movie company?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, being very sarcastic, and I figured they are owned by the production company. That said, I didn’t want to miss out on the chance to poke fun at all the people who bring up anything to get extra money means something is dead/dying/etc.<br />

it did bad because its bad, not because &quot;it didnt release on the right time&quot;<br />
<br />
the movie was flat out very bad and cringe.</div></div><hr />

I disagree about being bad but opinions are subjetive anyways. It did release too late though, after all hype for WoW has passed.</div></div><hr />

He meant the release date. Look when Marvel released their comics and how their movies still do a lot of money &quot;today&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Well its a very diferent situation. Anything based on a game depends a lot of the momentum.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phattsao</div><div class="date">2019-07-05, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking through the auction, I noticed there is not a lot of Horde stuff. Like, no Horde banners or anything. And that kind of sums up one of the problems with the movie: the Horde was all CGI. Now, I understand making the ORCS computer-generated, because of their size and all that, but they made EVERYTHING about the horde CGI. The environments, the huts, the banners, everything: hence no Horde props. Had they actually constructed that stuff and then added the CGI orcs into actual environments, it might have felt less like a cartoon. Just an observation.</div></div><hr />

You're not wrong about that part, but the movie was terrible anyway. Visually it had its moments, but the casting, acting, and writing were awful. Only the most diehard of fans seem able to look past these glaring failures, which is pretty telling.</div></div><hr />
