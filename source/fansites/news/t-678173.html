<br />
Warning, Speculation here. Nothing is confirmed (Also, quests spoilers)<br />
We don't really have any details on these mounts for the moment, but after some digging in the game files and on PTR servers it seems that one of these mounts is already active under the name of Armored Frostbrood Vanquisher (MOUNT) (BLUE) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/38695/armored-frostbrood-vanquisher-mount-blue/). <br />
<br />
Two spells are also named after this mount : Frostbrood Vanquisher (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/52196/frostbrood-vanquisher/) and Frostbrood Vanquisher Flight (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53112/frostbrood-vanquisher-flight/). <br />
<br />
The only Vanquishers we know are the Wyrmrest Vanquisher (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/50426/call-wyrmrest-vanquisher/) used in the Wyrmrest Temple daily quests. The existing Frostbrood Vanquisher spells aren't really proper mount spells and at this point nothing says that we will be able to learn them like normal mounts, even if it wouldn't be very surprising to see a new set of flying mount as a reward for Glory of the Icecrown Raider (25 player) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4603/glory-of-the-icecrown-raider-25-player/) (Objectives and rewards are obviously placeholders at this point)<br />
<br />
Things get interesting when you look at quests introduced with this build especially one of them ...<br />
<br />
Respite for a Tormented Soul (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24872/respite-for-a-tormented-soul/)<br />
Deliver Sindragosa's Essence to Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight.<br />
<br />
Description<br />
Take this Life Crystal, and have your companions take one as well. It contains potent energies from the verdant Dragonshrine in Dragonblight, and it was my own secret to resisting the dark magics of this place for so long. When you face Sindragosa, battle her until she is weakened, and then have your companions use these Crystals to coax out the essence that is dormant within her. If you then defeat her, you should be able to recover it and return it to Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to jump to conclusions here, but it looks like the latest build added a way to control Frostbrood wyrms and a quest to preserve Sindragosa's Essence at the same time? I'm also pretty sure that the Icecrown Citadel doesn't have an elevator with a &quot;Frozen Throne&quot; button. <br />
<br />
We'll probably learn more about this in the next builds, stay tuned and keep in mind that at this point it's just speculation. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tools Patch Issues: Please Read<br />
We are aware that since the latest tools patch, some players are receiving the error, &quot;invalid game version&quot; when attempting to login to the game. In order to resolve this issue, you must allow the launcher to run so the appropriate update can be applied.<br />
<br />
We've also identified an issue that's preventing players from running the launcher while wow.exe is open. This is preventing players from running multiple iterations of World of Warcraft. As a temporary work-around, until this issue is resolved, simply run the second game instance by opening wow.exe directly from your World of Warcraft folder.<br />
<br />
If your download fails, please wait a few moments and try again. We hope to have these issues corrected shortly, and appreciate your understanding. <br />

PUG with the Blues - Take Two!<br />
Since our first test went so well, we’d like to invite everyone out again for round 2! Come join the fun on the PTR; and instead of looting the PUG blues, you could end up with a PUG blue (see what we did there?). Members of the Development Team (including the encounter designers themselves), the QA team, and the Community Team will be on the PTRs to test out the new dungeon system and want you to come join in the fun.<br />
<br />
To have a chance to group up with one of us, just queue up for a random Heroic through the Dungeon tool. We will be playing both Alliance and Horde, and since the Dungeon tool allows players to group cross-server, it doesn’t matter which of the two PTR realms you join from.<br />
<br />
Join us Wednesday 11/11/09 at 4:00pm PST. We'll see you then! :) <br />

Blue posts<br />
Oculus nerf in 3.3<br />
As is evidenced in this thread, players have strong opinions on Oculus in contrast to the majority of the other Wrath of the Lich King dungeons. With the implementation of the new Dungeon system and Random Dungeon option in patch 3.3, many players were asking for the ability to black list at least one dungeon from the selection pool. If a large number of players want to black list Oculus because they don't find it enjoyable -- and it can often times be a pick-up group killer -- we view that as a problem. We do not, however, see a viable solution in giving players the ability to simply remove any dungeon they want from the Random Dungeon rotation. That takes away from the idea of randomness. In addition, we feel the benefits afforded players when running random Heroic dungeons (extra emblems, the chance to run a specific Heroic instance more than once a day, etc.) are too good to let them narrow down the list as they see fit.<br />
<br />
As a compromise, we've made the standard fights in Oculus a bit easier, and increased the benefits of item-based vehicle scaling to make the drake combat less cumbersome. We hope these changes deter players from deserting a random dungeon when it happens to be Oculus. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21042554677-loloculus-nerf.html))<br />
<br />
Vanity Pets with Stats?<br />
We enjoy adding things into the game that just add flavor and aren't part of any min-maxing discussions. The non-combat pets are one of these things and so are things like titles. As soon as we put some stats on them the purpose changes entirely and anything without the ideal stats becomes &quot;worthless&quot;. Imagine if the cockroaches had the best stats and you see 25 of them in a raid... kinda weird. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20861001213-vanity-pets-with-stats.html))<br />
<br />
Pugging in 3.3<br />
Just a couple of observations from our point of view:<br />
<br />
1) Players who don't pug dramatically underestimate the number of people who do.<br />
2) Players often assume every realm has the same dynamics that their realm has.<br />
<br />
Pugging is something an awful lot of players do and our (frankly inadequate) tool didn't facilitate that experience very well. The new tool is pretty fast and simple. If you enjoy pugging (or don't enjoy it but do it anyway :) ) the new tool should let you spend less time organizing and more time killing (or wiping :( ).<br />
<br />
If pugging isn't your thing, that's cool. We're not trying to push you into it... unless you really like pugs (by which I mean the pooch). The tool will also benefit premades. <br />
<br />
Dungeon System<br />
1. You can run with whoever you like. You can /invite or have the tool find random players to fill it in (it is pretty smart in who it finds too). If you find random people, we place some restrictions on your group to discourage griefing.<br />
<br />
2. I don't want to get into this too much in this thread because the discussion has already gone on and on regarding this topic. However, an old style LFG channel doesn't make much sense (because 1, the tool finds groups pretty quickly, and 2, we don't like people lurking in the tool and messing up matchmaking just to use the chat channel). Making a new LFG channel world wide would instantly become the new channel of choice for gold sellers, spammers or people who are bored and want attention. Making a second city-wide &quot;trade&quot; channel might at least draw some of the legit LFG lookers from the traders. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/20677677312-devs-really-have-me-confused-with-the-new-lfg.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter <br />
Hunter using focus in Cataclysm<br />
If you ignore combo points (which we aren't planning on adding to hunters), then the biggest decision energy-users face is whether to use a single 60 energy attack or two 30 energy attacks. The answer depends on a lot of variables, including which does more damage, what is on cooldown, the synergy between the abilities, etc.<br />
<br />
If you consider the cat druid (because it's slightly simpler) and ignore finishing moves, then the druid rotation would look something like getting up a +bleed attack, applying a bleed dot, getting up a +damage buff, and then doing the actual damage. You could imagine something similar like that for hunters. I don't mean hunters are going to be a +bleed class, but more that the choice of what attack to push next should have some decision behind it. It won't just be Serpent Sting x 1, Chimera Shot x 1000. Repeat.<br />
<br />
Also most of the answers quoted above were from Blizzcon. These answers fall into three basic categories: things we know we're going to do, things we'd like to do, and things we hadn't really thought about before someone asked a question (e.g. taming mounts).<br />
<br />
Also, Enhancement shamans will almost certainly stay as mana-users but still share (non Int) gear with hunters. This likely means some kind of attack power to mana regen mechanic like Ret paladins have currently. However development on stuff like this is still early.<br />
<br />
[...] I said ignore the finishers, so that removes Rip and FB. You are left with a bleed (Rake), a bleed buffer (Mangle), a damage buff (SR) and then the actual attack, Shred. Someone unfamiliar with kitties might say &quot;Oh I'll just use all my energy on Shred, because it does the most dps&quot; the way someone unfamiliar with focus-based hunters might say &quot;Oh I'll just use all my focus on Chimera / Explosive once they aren't on cooldowns.&quot; Our plan is to make the rotation have more depth than that. It won't be at the Feral level of complexity without cps and finishers and because hunters have other things to manage, like Fluffy. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21035173927-hunters-with-focus-will-it-really-matter.html))<br />
<br />
Focus and abilities cooldowns<br />
Sorry, I meant if we remove the cooldown from those shots then someone might jump to the conclusion that hunters will just spam them. I don't know if we will be able to remove the cooldown or not. Shred does not have a cooldown yet Ferals use many other abilities. That is one way to go. Another is to keep a small cooldown, but in general we think focus will let us take cooldowns off a lot of hunter abilities since the income rate of focus will help us balance the costs.<br />
<br />
In general (and with many exceptions) you can't balance mana-using spells around cost since casters have nearly unlimited mana at any point in time and certainly early on in a fight. Energy (and focus, and rage to a much lesser extent to where it's actually a problem) are limited at any given moment but come back pretty quickly. Mana-spells have to be balanced around cast times and cooldowns instead. Hunters generally lack cast times, so most abilities have cooldowns which lead to annoying collisions and a lot of timer-watching. Focus should help improve that. We hope!

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue<br />
Antiarc will get rogues nerfed (Check PoisonSwapper (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/poisonswapper.aspx))<br />
As some players are pointing out, it's not the existence of an add-on that's the issue. It's what this means for playing a rogue. We don't want to see the &quot;How to play a rogue FAQ&quot; that starts &quot;Step One. Download the weapon swapping add-on.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's one thing if it's a niche deal that generates a marginal dps increase. It's another if rogues feel like they have to play with the add-on.<br />
<br />
We're still not convinced this will become super mainstream, but we'll see. I said before it's a concern and it's still a concern. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21043884738-rogue-weapon-swapping-isnt-a-big-deal.html))<br />

Doomguard and Guardians<br />
Singling out the Doomguard for just a moment...<br />
<br />
Are you saying you don't mind giving up your Imp or Felhound for the Doomguard? Are you talking like on a long cooldown or not? Because really with shorter cooldowns now my concern would be that every boss attempt you'd have the Doomguard out. In which case who would use the Felhound?<br />
<br />
With guardians as a short-term guardian that doesn't replace your current demon it's easier to carve off a niche. Once they replace the Imp, Felhound, Felguard, Voidwalker, Succubus, then it's tricker to make work.

I doubt that this is true anymore.<br />
If we were talking about that in BC, I'd say &quot;yes&quot;. But it's WotLK-time.<br />

Then you don't deserve the mount. Effort = Reward. No effort = No reward. It's simple really.<br />

We enjoy adding things into the game that just add flavor and aren't part of any min-maxing discussions. The non-combat pets are one of these things and so are things like titles. As soon as we put some stats on them the purpose changes entirely and anything without the ideal stats becomes &quot;worthless&quot;. Imagine if the cockroaches had the best stats and you see 25 of them in a raid... kinda weird. (Source)<br />
<br />
There's all kinds of ways to personalize our companion pets to be more interesting and fun.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of giving them stats, but how bout making them non-essential like fishing, cooking and gathering stats or an enhancement to the appearance of our clothing, hair or the way we walk in the form of sparkles, colors or size, selectable, depending on the pet. <br />
<br />
Band-width intensively interesting? <br />
<br />
How bout a Barber Pet? Cooking pet. One that would skin your kill automatically when your Rhino hits the ground or run to and pick the closest herb? <br />
<br />
A mule pet...one that would contain a bag or two?<br />
<br />
We could be more humane and allow them to interract with other like-pets within a certain radius by running to them and giving a high-five or hug or something. Awww.<br />

Warlocks have no cooldowns to make an extra push besides these all of now. If u wanna make doomguard as the pet it is right now its fine but please tons of classes have this so why not make infernal off the pet bar so it does not take away ur pet out now. Or do it with both and make doomguard out like infernal is that way we can pop either one if our pet goes down. As demo you would never use either of these especially if your specced into summon and even as destro i wont use anything but infernal and only if my imp dies. these are almost useless plz fix them. I know the blues mentioned this so they have thought about it, i just dont see why they have decided against it. They want are pet to be more use to us then let us keep our felguard,imp,pup,etc. and give us this short cooldown, like army,wolves, etc</div></div><hr />

I prefer to get mounts from &quot;sure things&quot; like meeting a certain achievement quota than looking for them in eggs for weeks on end for example, or from 0,001% drop rates or whatever. If you can't get at least the 5man heroic mount, that does not bound you to a week of raiding or anything like that, then you don't get a drake it's that simple.<br />
<br />
There are some things that are not ment for the entire WoW population. You call the people that get these elites or elitists, I call them proper or at least half-decent players. It's not a question of time if you take the red proto into account, it's just a question of less than moderate skill. Now if you want a 310% speed mount, you have to work just a little bit more for it, plenty of 10man guilds getting them with 1-2 raids per week and that is more than casual imo so doable as well (even PuG's on certain realms but it's not that wide spread maybe). You just need to know a bit about the game and your class, you need to be a decent player (again, people saying you need to be in top guilds, hard-core guilds or semi-harcore guilds are just deceiving themselfs).<br />
<br />
If you can't play the game, don't expect rewards like these, just like in real life: if you can't pull your own weight and do your tasks at work, don't expect too many bonuses (expect none actually).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Puffy</div><div class="date">2009-11-10, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i just suggest a rep based proto dragon of some sort, at exalted. <br />
<br />
Like the way netherdrakes were.<br />
<br />
Back in BC you saw some, but not at the level of wow, ive seen hundreds today. Thats cause back then 5k gold was a little harder to achieve, which was needed to start the netherdragon chain.<br />
<br />
But now its easier.<br />
<br />
So to avoid having so many of these proto drakes, putting an extra requirement besides Exalted is one way to do it.<br />
<br />
You can't probably find out, but i bet what 90% of those dont give em to non raiders, are the raiders with the special mounts acting elitist.</div></div><hr />

I used to be in a guild that would never pug. They refused to since they thought every player that wasn't in our guild was terrible.<br />

Of course I wasn't like that, I wanted to complete my goals so I would join any pug I could. Accomplished what I wanted rather quickly. The people in my guild though, they would whine and moan how no one in the guild would help them out, which ended up causing some major guild drama.

Probably. At least you are the minority. And by minority I mean &lt; 1% (totally made up). I mean why do hunters use mana? They aren't spell casters. The little magic they use is probably not of natural (i.e. magical) source. Hunters use mana only for game mechanics purposes because it was easier back then, when they were introduced.<br />
You are no magical class. Pure physical dps. And no connection to magic like shamans or paladins (because they can be phys. dps too but mana is legitimate for them).</div></div><hr />

If this is an argument that the proto-drake isn't accessible without raiding gear, I don't buy it. People were nabbing this achievement in full blues/quest rewards the first few weeks after WotLK's release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you think having more + whatever and orange color instead of purple is cooler then a freaking ZOMG Skeleton flying with cloud ontop and FREAKING ARMOR 1337. I know what id want. :P Thought I admit id like a legendary but those are actually not handed out to all hardcores... :-\<br />
If the mount would be from rep I promise u that everyone would have one because sure its an effort, (small one ) to grind rep for a week or two, but raiding hardmodes and doing the hardest content in-game in a guild is way harder and time-consuming. ;) <br />
Im not hardcore/elite and i still dont want everyone to have this. Instead i want to be like: <br />
- Oh god! Wish i could get one of those! when i see an player with it. <br />
Instead of:<br />
- Oh man, another retard with that bloody mount -.-<br />
<br />
And yea, I know its an game, so if anyone doesnt like what ive wrote in reply to &quot;insert name here lol, dont remember ;D&quot; then say something useful, thanks!</div></div><hr />

Oculus nerf in 3.3<br />
As is evidenced in this thread, players have strong opinions on Oculus in contrast to the majority of the other Wrath of the Lich King dungeons. With the implementation of the new Dungeon system and Random Dungeon option in patch 3.3, many players were asking for the ability to black list at least one dungeon from the selection pool. If a large number of players want to black list Oculus because they don't find it enjoyable -- and it can often times be a pick-up group killer -- we view that as a problem. We do not, however, see a viable solution in giving players the ability to simply remove any dungeon they want from the Random Dungeon rotation. That takes away from the idea of randomness. In addition, we feel the benefits afforded players when running random Heroic dungeons (extra emblems, the chance to run a specific Heroic instance more than once a day, etc.) are too good to let them narrow down the list as they see fit.<br />
<br />
<br />
WHen will blizzard learn to stop nerfing things just because some people are too stupid to do a simple heroic?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeon</div><div class="date">2009-11-10, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If this is an argument that the proto-drake isn't accessible without raiding gear, I don't buy it. People were nabbing this achievement in full blues/quest rewards the first few weeks after WotLK's release.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree completely, there was only 1 achievement that was considered difficult and that was the Gotta Go! 2 minute Anub'arak kill in Azjol'Nerub. I was still able to pull this off using a 4 DPS 1 Tank group with Heroism and we managed to kill him in 1 min 47 sec in mainly quest blues and some crafted ilvl 200 epics. They ended up buffing this time limit to 4 minutes so that anyone could finish it. The fact that normal heroics along with the daily quests can get you a mix of T8 and T9 to accomplish these trivial achievements to get a &quot;rare&quot; mount/proto-drake should mean that just about anyone at any level of skill should have access to a proto-drake mount.<br />
<br />
Claiming that a rare drake needs to be implemented via a reputation grind in WotLK so that the masses may finally have access to one is far from accurate. This is not a debate between hardcore and casual. This is an argument based on people who like a small child in a toy store see something new and exciting and immediately start demanding they receive it with as little effort as possible. How long until the next shiny?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No, you're not the only one. My hunter has been my main for years, and the change to focus has me concerned... I have grown accustomed to my mana resource and having cooldown-based abilities, whether it's thematically appropriate or not. I'm not saying &quot;ZOMG blizard is going 2 ruin huntrz w/ focus!@!&quot; I will reserve my final judgement until I get a chance to try it out and try getting used to the change. My concern stems from the apparent similarity of focus to rogue energy... To be blunt, I don't really like rogue combat mechanics. I actually don't mind the combo-point system, but I hate waiting on energy. I don't raid in cat-form on my feral druid for the same reason. (If I'm asked to go DPS, I switch to Balance spec.) <br />
<br />
I'm simply worried that I won't be able to adjust to the new focus system to a point where I still enjoy playing a hunter. If that happens, I'd have to switch my main to continue raiding as a class I enjoy, and after all the work I've put into my hunter (raiding, achievements, mount/pet collections, etc.) that would just plain suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's not, it's just time consuming. The only thing that's &quot;hard&quot; about farming rep is repressing the urge to jump off a building after doing the same quest 20 days in a row. It doesn't require nearly as much time or skill as doing hard-modes does. You even stated so yourself by saying &quot;I don't have time to raid&quot;.<br />
<br />
There needs to be some sort of special reward to raiders beyond better gear. Especially since there is no more &quot;unique&quot; content for high-level raiders. Gear gets replaced fast, but you actually get to keep your vanity items. If there were no achievements, titles, and other vanity rewards there would be no point for me to go on raiding anymore.<br />
<br />
The frostwyrm is iconic, so I'm hoping it drops from the GotICR achievement. Although I'll be just as excited if it turns out to be the invincible mount instead :)</div></div><hr />

Sigh. I swear the elitist bullshit is getting old and FAST! What people are wanting is a Proto drake that does not require sheer LUCK. I have gotten an egg every week from the oracles since I hit 80, about 10 months ago, (seems odd that WOTLK has been out almost if not already a whole year now), and I have not seen a single Protodrake in my egg. I have run Heroic UK everytime I can and nothing drops. Time lost proto drake? HA forget it, if you really think a casual player will see this thing anytime soon, then you are seriously mental. Hell I know TONS of Hardcore players who have not even seen it. What wold be wrong with a certain colored protodrake that you got from rep alone? Maybe a Green or Teal, or even Black one? All the casuals would have them and the &quot;elitist&quot; could still go afk on their Iron bound or Rusted Protos, and have people drool over them, or is the fact that your mount flys at 310% not enough of a reward for you? <br />
<br />
So why do you need to be set apart from those of us in LOL normal gear? I guess that you could say that it's because you put time and effort into this game so you &quot;deserve&quot; something? Well then, I deserve better health care since I make X amount of dollars a year. I deserve to live in a civilization without you &quot;Lol&quot; normal jobbed people? I should be able to &quot;afk&quot; in my car while you walk by and drool wanting it. How does that sound? Oh and before I get the &quot;ZOMG it's a video game so your comparison fails.&quot; It's called a metaphor if half of these message boards passed 8th grade English they would understand that. Why I ask WHY do you need some THING to set you apart? Are you not content with the simple knowledge that you can down hardmodes? Should there be a reward for everything that you do so you can feel special? Well then I here by grant you a cookie for taking a poop today!<br />
<br />
Also avoid the &quot;Random daily&quot; all you want, funny thing is the &quot;good players&quot; those who are part of bleeding edge guilds are going to pug these for those emblems, so that they can obtain better gear faster. While you are stuck just a few badges behind them, because you refused to run with &quot;pugs&quot;. So by all means cripple your guild that you love so much by not pugging to get the best gear you can, if you were in fact as good as you say you would wade through what you consider &quot;shit&quot; to get to your ultimate goal. (EDIT: I was under the impression you had to go into the LFG to do the random daily and get the Emblems. Even if you do not your unwillingness to do so still makes my above argument valid)<br />
<br />
I would love for some of the world firsts or even top end guilds members come to these forums and treat you &quot;Hardcores&quot; the way you treat us Casuals. &quot;LOL no heroic Algalon? Screw you scrub.&quot; &quot;You haven't done Tribute to Instanity? Well then sorry you can't run with us!&quot; &quot;LOL stupid wannabe wants a horde wolf and a nice cloak, isn't that cute. You gotta work for it noob!&quot; It's funny to actually armory HALF if not more of the characters on this site and find out they haven't downed Algalon or even Anub in Heroic TOC, and want to complain about &quot;casual scrubs.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Wow if that is all you have to say to that huge post, then.. WOW.<br />
<br />
No it is not, yet not every person in this game is able to get a heroics group together to do said achievements. Funny thing is the reason alot of casuals are complaining that they can't get said mounts, is because of &quot;hard cores&quot; laughing them out of heroics because they have as you put it &quot;Lol normal mode gear&quot;. Sure they could probably band together and get the achievements done, but they do not really have the TIME to sit in LFG for an hour trying to get a pug together cause their group is missing a healer or tank, just to find one and he either leave or tell the group leader to kick them cause they are in &quot;Lol normal mode gear.&quot;</div></div><hr />

So what you want is a drake available to people who are too bad to do heroics?<br />
<br />
I have never seen someone laughed out of a heroic for bad gear. And no, I don't have a 310% myself yet--just finishing up Firefighter and One Light this week. <br />
<br />
If you're being kicked from heroic groups, you should consider something. Maybe it's not that the other players think they are significantly better. Maybe it's not that they're elitist. Maybe they're just ok guys.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's you.</div></div><hr />

Or maybe it's not. I am a good player I will say that. Sure I pug heroics, but I run with my guild for raids everyweek. I farm my mats for my flasks, read up on fights, know where to stand and what to do for fights, and top dps, while coaching the other new dps in our guild. I am geared enough for heroics, geared enough for 10-25 TOC. Sadly enough my fiance is not, and it is HER who is laughed out of heroics, and as a geared Dps I am easy to replace if the leader wants to be a dick and kick her. She is alot more casual than I, is she a bad player? No not at all, she knows fights ect as well, but since she works 60+ hours a week she does not have the time or energy to come home plan our wedding and get groups together for heroic Achievement runs, and she is what is considered the average American. It could be my server, we are known for the biggest assholes in WOW, but something tells me it happens to others as well. <br />
<br />
Also when did I say people who are too BAD to do heroics? I think I said those who don't have TIME.</div></div><hr />

So let me get this straight. Your fiancee is bad, and somehow she gets kicked from heroics? Lead your own damn heroics then. I'm on the top US Horde Progression server, and usually pugging heroics leads to a mix of people in quest greens and people in 258 and no one cares because heroics are a joke. I don't understand what your complaint is. You were originally upset that the protos were too hard to get, but you're apparently doing raid content every week?<br />
<br />
Get better or get out.</div></div><hr />

However the nerf is pretty pointless seeing how the problem with occulus was that it was a huge gimick instance. Hey look we added vehicles in the expansion, your tool bar just went down to 3 buttons and your class doesn't matter! Cool huh? They shoulda just takin that shit heap of an instance out of the random rotation.<br />
<br />
Also just because this is a video game doesn't mean it's for children. Especially an mmo. If you are a parent and let your kid play an mmo you fail, they should be outside playing, not grinding rep for a protodrake with you. So no, making wow easy enough for an 8 year old is not cool. Some one said it before, but if you wanna play an 8 year olds game Hello Kitty's Island Adventure is on sale at walmart. Might be even cheaper on black Friday if you can wait.<br />
<br />
And the point of an mmo is to be better than other people??? WTF? I thought it was to work together with other people so you can at least be social while wasting away playing a video game. Is your self esteem that low? If your a fat geek with an iron bound protodrake, guess what? You are still a fat geek.<br />

So yes gear is not everything :)<br />
<br />
And I think you misunderstood my &quot;Lol normal mode gear&quot;, I say this in a way because look at Ulduar and TOC, everyone can clear normal mode so very easily each week leaving everyone with the same progress and same gear.

You want people who apparently only have 10 minutes to play the game to have status symbols? That's all mounts are. If you want a cool looking mount, do the work for it. Why is that so hard? Red proto is easy as shit to get, even if you only have time for one heroic a day.</div></div><hr />

God you either don't read or CAN'T. I do raid conent every week you are right, yet just because I am supporting those who aren't able to get into raids and get the best of the best, DOES NOT mean I am one. No I don't have full triumph gear, no I don't have BIS, but I raid enough and know enough about this game to not be considered bad, yet do not have all the time in the world to play so I would be considered &quot;casual&quot;. I spend and average of 15 hours a week playing, that's not that much considering how many hours some people log. Also.. I never said she was bad I said she did not have TIME. Casual does not equal bad people, (not in all cases) it equals people who lack time, that is all.</div></div><hr />

I guess Netherdrakes were a status symbol. She was able to get one of those, cause she has time to do a few dailys for gold and a rep grind. That is all casuals are asking for, a grind-able WOTLK mount that looks decent, they don't care about runed drakes ect. just a proto of any color I am sure would suffice them.</div></div><hr />

I think it'll go something like this.<br />
&quot;Good job getting her essence, now we have to cleanse her. Get this from ICC.&quot;<br />
Get another thing.<br />
Put the new essence in the spirit grinder in ICC so it can gather the soul.<br />
Grats, now we have her ghost.<br />
Ghost has shit load of quests and chains.<br />
Rep grind cause she still doesn't like you.<br />
Exalted. <br />
Either purchase or go BACK into ICC and &quot;save&quot; one or something.<br />
<br />
They COULD very well be rewards for Glory of the ICC Raider. Unless there is GICCR-10, GICCR-25, HGICCR-10, and HGICCR-25 to match all four of the models then I doubt they are the rewards. And none of them seems obviously &quot;better&quot; than the other unlike the other raiding mounts. I think the Winged Horse (Invincible) model is going to possibly show up either as a stupidly rare drop, like the phoenix, from Arthas or turn out to be the achievement mount.</div></div><hr />

But, I'm not sure how that would involve the new mounts. Sindragosa is the &quot;brood mother&quot; of the wyrms in Icecrown, but if we were to gather her essence and except quests from, we wouldn't be talking to a Frost Wyrm; we'd be talking to a blue dragon. After all, that's what she was before she became Sindragosa. She was also the consort of Malygos, and since Malygos is now dead, any story arcs that could contain the two are sort of ruined.</div></div><hr />

Mate, you took what I said and went completely off topic. I said it as a dig at you to try and provoke a reaction. This makes me sucessful troll. You on, the other hand, completely ignored all the points I raised and just decided to go on a rant about how mature I am? I hope your girlfriend reads this forum so she can see the internet white knight you have become. But I doubt it seeing as she gets kicked from heroics. How can she has such bad gear yet have time to grind for a netherwing? Maybe she need to get her priorities straight or maybe she could get her fiancee to stop coming and whining on a forum about how she is enjoying the game DOING SOMETHING ELSE.<br />

And the personal attacks continue. Sadly I have no time for this. You win, congrats. I offered some VALID arguments, but in your opinion they are not, so I suppose it comes down to opinions. I think some mounts should be a tad easier to get, you do not. Sadly people on this forum seem to prefer casual bashing and insults to actually discussing a game.

<br />
Where did I say I wanted a freebie, or a hand-out. Did I say that I wanted a rusted Protodrake for free. Did I saw I deserve an Iron Bound Protodrake without having to raid? No I did not. I do think however that upping the drop rate a tad on the Oracle Drake and the Blue drake might be prudent. Do I think that I should get a 310% mount for free not at all. So please understand that wanting a grindable protodrake or making the &quot;casual&quot; drakes drop a bit more is not me asking for a freebie or hand out. As I said earlier for 10months I have gotten an egg from those little Oracles every week, and yet nothing, it is very disappointing to get aged yolk 3 times in a row. I have run the Heroic for the drake almost every other day, and nothing, and have wasted alot of time looking for the ever elusive TLPD. NO I do not want a handout but I would like my Protodrake of any color, after all it's not like it's a rare drake or a status symbol at this point in the game. <br />
<br />
And I suppose my anger might be misdirected at the &quot;Elitist&quot; it's not their fault I do not have the time to spend 3 hours a night wiping on hard mode fights, but it is infuriating when they tell you they are better than you, and you don't deserve anything you are given in this game, or decide to flaunt their &quot;toys&quot; by going AFK in front of raids ect.</div></div><hr />

What I'm trying to say is that alot of things in this game become relative to alot of situations. The key is not to really care what everybody else has.

<br />
The new GotICR reward shouldn't be a proto-drake. I'm pretty sure you're not the only person who is sick of them. It's the most overused flying mount this expansion. It would be a slap in the face to all raiders out there for them to reuse the proto-drake model for the next achievement (especially since you'll most likely need arthas hard-mode down). We deserve something more imo.<br />

<br />
Like how you would say casual != bad? I'm telling you progressive raiders != &quot;elitist&quot; asshole. It's the same stereotypical concept and I'm sure you agree. Just because some are, does not mean everyone is. Trust me, I hate those people you mentioned just as much. And I'm no casual myself. But, by stating a claim that some group is the problem other than a few individuals you're doing exactly the same thing as those elitists' that you dislike so much.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
NO I do not want a handout but I would like my Protodrake of any color, after all it's not like it's a rare drake or a status symbol at this point in the game. <br />
<br />
That's all well and good, I can understand why you would want a proto-drake because they are like this expansion's &quot;netherwing drakes&quot;. However coming onto the forums and making an angry post about how you hate this or that, and calling out progressive raiders as &quot;elitists&quot;, is not going to get you the kind of attention you want, and you should know better than that.<br />
<br />
Ultimately what you're looking for is not what wow is anymore. With this expansion, a casual got the ability to see all raid content on the normal modes, while the progressed raiders got the extra perks of mounts and titles. This is what the game has become. If you had it the old way, most casual guilds would still be stuck in the beginning of ulduar or raiding naxx. Which doesn't sound like good design to me.</div></div><hr />

People were nabbing this achievement in full blues/quest rewards the first few weeks after WotLK's release.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yup, it's just a short search away to find out that the first Glory of the Hero was completed shortly before November 23rd, 2008. I was casually doing heroics one day, when I found out I had somehow gotten about 3/4ths of all the achievements. From there on, I casually got together groups for the achievements, and forced my PUGs to attempt the achievements. Now I'm just one achievement away. WTB shaman for Less-Rabi, amirite?<br />
<br />
Either way, it's generally pretty easy to do for anyone, casual or otherwise dedicated to getting a proto-drake.</div></div><hr />

My hunter has been my main for years, and the change to focus has me concerned... I have grown accustomed to my mana resource and having cooldown-based abilities, whether it's thematically appropriate or not. I'm not saying &quot;ZOMG blizard is going 2 ruin huntrz w/ focus!@!&quot; I will reserve my final judgement until I get a chance to try it out and try getting used to the change. My concern stems from the apparent similarity of focus to rogue energy... To be blunt, I don't really like rogue combat mechanics. I actually don't mind the combo-point system, but I hate waiting on energy. I don't raid in cat-form on my feral druid for the same reason. (If I'm asked to go DPS, I switch to Balance spec.) <br />
<br />
I'm simply worried that I won't be able to adjust to the new focus system to a point where I still enjoy playing a hunter. If that happens, I'd have to switch my main to continue raiding as a class I enjoy, and after all the work I've put into my hunter (raiding, achievements, mount/pet collections, etc.) that would just plain suck.<br />
<br />
I can only agree with this. I love my huntard and ive put so much time and money into him. Achievements, 90 mounts atm, gear, pets, etc. Its my main and it has EVERYTHING my 4 other alts dont. The play style of a hunter is not like any other class in the game. Ill agree its a clunky class and it needs a rewrite but im really afraid to see wat focus is going to bring. Blue walls were talking about making one shot cost about 30 focus at the minimum. So thats about two shots i can squeeze off. They also said they might have something like steady shot regen focus at 20 focus/steady shot. So in my mind i instantly think of finding myself standing in an area and i see a melee start coming after me. I squeeze off my two shots then im FORCED to stand still and try and steady shot him to regen my focus. Face rolled. Yet i cant fire at point blank range like every other range class can and have no focus with a regen blue Walls say they want slower than a rouges or warriors rage/energy. hrmph.<br />
<br />
Like the comment above me ill bite my tongue till i see them in action in the future, but im very worried. So much in fact i made a back up mage in case im unhappy with the changes.</div></div><hr />

Hey, guess what? You're not the only one who wants it. I've been trying to get one since the beginning of WOTLK. Stop complaining, and continue buying those eggs like everyone else is doing, including me. If you don't like it, go complain to blizzard.

Hey! Guess what? I have run UP for almost everyday too and still didn't get the drake. I lost a few hours searching for the TLPD. There's a reason why Blizzard made them rare drops, because they are supposed to be rare. Meaning not everyone is supposed to have one. If they increased the drop rate, every one would get one and AFK in dalaran to show it off. If you want a cool mount in this game, either get into a raiding guild/pvp/spend the time and effort or cancel your subscription and play another game. Don't come here complaining, because we don't like people who complain constantly.<br />

It's alrdy bad enough that raiders get so many proto-drake mounts and for the rest it comes down to pure luck it drops from boss/egg.<br />
<br />
I hope they don't do the same with the Frostwyrms.<br />
<br />
Atleast have 1 proto-drake obtainable through rep, like netherdragons in BC.<br />
<br />
So many proto-dragons yet 80% of the ones you see are from hardcore raiders and the remaining 20% is of lucky people...<br />
<br />
That's not how it should be.<br />
<br />
Let raiders get their special 310% if they so want it, or fancy colored dragons, but atleast give other means of achieving 280% proto drakes to non raiders.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was kinda expecting the /sarcasm here.<br />
Cuz last time I checked non-raiders have 310% proto-drakes, and I kinda like the violet looks, so now im forced to do all the stupid holiday things!! Q f-ing Q!!!<br />

ICC is large, you may need to get on the mount in order to get to the frozen throne perhaps, since its way up above, and maybe ships can't function in the 'cold weather flying' hence a frostwyrm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">legz</div><div class="date">2009-11-11, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the ways they made the drakes obtainable perfectly balanced.<br />
If you're casual you have access to the green, time-lost,red and the violet Proto Drake<br />
<br />
I myself have the Time lost and Ironbound and I've found the Time lost just as epic to get as the Ironbound, maybe even more.<br />
<br />
If they would make the Ironbound/rusted obtainable for casual it wouldn't be worth to get it as raid achievement.<br />
<br />
I hope they keep the system intact for the frost wyrms.<br />
Maybe make an almost impossible solo achievement to kill all rarespawns ingame or something like that for a 280% speed version.<br />
And if you realy want a wyrm and don't have the time to raid go get good at PVP :P</div></div><hr />

Talking strictly from a Combat Rogue PoV. The mod advertises a 300 DPS increase on a BiS geared rogue and that's probably true in a utopic environment but I've tested this mod and here's the deal:<br />
<br />
- The swap uses a GCD as I'm sure you well know which means it can screw up your rotation by doing it at the worst possible time (ex. Adrenaline Rush is on and your energy is about to cap out, your Slice n Dice is about to drop and you need to refresh it etc.)<br />
- The mod uses a set time that you can change in order to swap and refresh the deadly poison and what I found is that even by setting it at 5 or 6 seconds which basically means you only get a 5-6 second window for your WP weapon (not to mention global cds) it was still very unreliable and during a 5 minute fight I had my 5 stack drop several times. Remember Deadly has a 30% to proc so you can be really unlucky even with a 1.4 speed dagger which I myself used.<br />
- Most bosses in ToC are deadly poison unfriendly because you find yourself swapping targets quite a lot thus dropping the 5 stack way too often.<br />
- Lastly, I'm not entirely sure about this but I've noticed Berserking not proccing from the swap weapons which leads me to believe it has an internal cooldown when you equip a weapon with it, meaning you'd have to settle for lesser fixed stats enchants on your OH weapon which could potentially lower your dps. (again not sure about this)<br />
<br />
TL;DR - I wouldn't bother with using PoisonSwapper unless you're in a guild that's on the bleeding edge of progression and even then it might cost you more that you gain from it.</div></div><hr />

We've got the Plagued, Black, Rusted, Ironbound, Red, Blue, Green, and Time-Lost for Proto-Drakes, and the Red, Black, Twilight, Azure and Bronze Drake. Recently, the Onyxia-Drake was added.<br />
<br />
Of these, the Blue and Green Proto-Drakes are lucky drops. They require you to run a simple and fast Heroic to the end of times, or just fly to Sholazar once a week to by an egg, and just hope for the best.<br />
<br />
The Red and Bronze Drake are, after those, perhaps the easiest to obtain. They don't require luck, just a regular group and some time for farm Rep. <br />
<br />
The Time-Lost is just a rare spawn of a rare spawn, which can be farmed (given you're willing to spend time and effort).<br />
<br />
The Plagued and Black Proto-Drakes, Runed and Ironbound Proto-Drakes, Black, Twilight, Azure and Onyxia-Drakes are raid-achievement rewards or low-droprate drops. These require by far the most effort to obtain, as they require you to get a decent amount of gear, spend a lot of time mastering fights, and find a decent raidgroup with to raid frequently. Not to forget that these mounts are most likely bound to a certain time, since many of these will be removed after a certain patch.<br />
<br />
The largest amount of these mounts are hard to obtain; you need time, effort, and brains to get these. Other mounts, on the other hand, require patience and luck.<br />
<br />
Right now, the largest amount of non-raiders are flying about on their Bronze Drake. It's easy to obtain, even by a retarded group. I liked the mount at first, but it soon got boring seeing every other player had it, too.<br />
<br />
This is the same with ToC5 HC gear. Sure, my tank-alt enjoys the fact she can easily gear up and get ready for raids without having to first farm Naxx 25 endlessly, but it's still the same; (pretty much) every non-raider, or casual raider, is wearing ToC5 HC gear, and two pieces of T8.5. Recently people also got their hands on T9 items fairly easy.<br />
<br />
For short; it's great that people can get drake-mounts and raid-level gear quickly; but these rewards aren't the best around and I really hope they never will. Obtaining mounts such as Proto-Drakes should be a goal for raiders, the end-level people that go beyond farming rep and Heroics. These are high-level, end-level rewards for high-level, end-level raiders. Not for every hillbilly boy who's too lazy or stupid to either raid, wait patiently, or spend time, effort or money.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you don't have time to work for them, you do not earn them. Not saying that everyone who's got little time on his hands doesn't deserve a mount, but what you saw is what you reap, even for mounts.</div></div><hr />

Sigh. I swear the elitist bullshit is getting old and FAST! What people are wanting is a Proto drake that does not require sheer LUCK. I have gotten an egg every week from the oracles since I hit 80, about 10 months ago, (seems odd that WOTLK has been out almost if not already a whole year now), and I have not seen a single Protodrake in my egg. I have run Heroic UK everytime I can and nothing drops. Time lost proto drake? HA forget it, if you really think a casual player will see this thing anytime soon, then you are seriously mental. Hell I know TONS of Hardcore players who have not even seen it. What wold be wrong with a certain colored protodrake that you got from rep alone? Maybe a Green or Teal, or even Black one? All the casuals would have them and the &quot;elitist&quot; could still go afk on their Iron bound or Rusted Protos, and have people drool over them, or is the fact that your mount flys at 310% not enough of a reward for you?<br />
<br />
Green Proto-Drake - 4% drop rate from the Egg<br />
Blue Proto-Drake - 1% (give or take a little) from Skadi<br />
Time-lost Proto-Drake - 100% Drop from a mob. I'm going to let you figure out which one.<br />
Red Proto-Drake - Heroic Achievement.<br />
<br />
To Add to that, there are macros you can get to see if the TLPD has dropped recently (lets your check the cache of the server)<br />
<br />
These mounts themselves are very -quick- to get. Yes, it takes a bit of luck, that's a bit of an annoyance, i understand, but in terms of elbow grease, your not losing a lot of time for them.<br />
<br />
Green Proto-Drake - Once you unlock the dailies, 3 Dailies a Day (20 min, give or take, and that is simply to get your rep high enough, after that is just login, rightclick)<br />
Blue Proto-Drake - 1 Heroic UP Run per day (30 min or so with a solid group)<br />
Time-Lost Proto-Drake - If Its Up, 10 min TOPS, or its not up and your not wasting time (before you say &quot;but i need to spend time to try and find it&quot; use mods and macros that, once again, check the cache)<br />
Red Proto-Drake - 2 Weeks of Effort, and not alot of Effort. <br />
<br />
<br />
So why do you need to be set apart from those of us in LOL normal gear? I guess that you could say that it's because you put time and effort into this game so you &quot;deserve&quot; something? Well then, I deserve better health care since I make X amount of dollars a year. I deserve to live in a civilization without you &quot;Lol&quot; normal jobbed people? I should be able to &quot;afk&quot; in my car while you walk by and drool wanting it. How does that sound? Oh and before I get the &quot;ZOMG it's a video game so your comparison fails.&quot; It's called a metaphor if half of these message boards passed 8th grade English they would understand that. Why I ask WHY do you need some THING to set you apart? Are you not content with the simple knowledge that you can down hardmodes? Should there be a reward for everything that you do so you can feel special? Well then I here by grant you a cookie for taking a poop today!<br />
<br />
You've simply made arguements against yourself here.<br />
<br />
People who make more money do, typically, get better health care, even in countries like France and Canada. It's called a 2-Tier system.<br />
<br />
Rich People do, technically, have their own &quot;Civilization&quot; as you call it. High Society, the Upper Class vs. Middle Class. Or Even Upper Middle vs Lower Middle.<br />
<br />
As For Cars. People who have expensive cars do tend to show them off in real life. They feel they are above others and park across 2 - 4 parking spots in a parking lot because they feel their Ferrari or their Audi R8 is far superior to your Toyota Corolla<br />
<br />
These mounts are signs, whether you like them or not, they set them apart because they deserve to be set apart.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also avoid the &quot;Random daily&quot; all you want, funny thing is the &quot;good players&quot; those who are part of bleeding edge guilds are going to pug these for those emblems, so that they can obtain better gear faster. While you are stuck just a few badges behind them, because you refused to run with &quot;pugs&quot;. So by all means cripple your guild that you love so much by not pugging to get the best gear you can, if you were in fact as good as you say you would wade through what you consider &quot;shit&quot; to get to your ultimate goal. (EDIT: I was under the impression you had to go into the LFG to do the random daily and get the Emblems. Even if you do not your unwillingness to do so still makes my above argument valid)<br />
<br />
And more power to those people in &quot;bleeding edge guilds&quot;. If they pug randomly, they pug randomly. It is their choice for how fast they want to get their higher end gear, and you have no right to dictate whether they are allowed to or not. Maybe taking a page out of their book might help your cause.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would love for some of the world firsts or even top end guilds members come to these forums and treat you &quot;Hardcores&quot; the way you treat us Casuals. &quot;LOL no heroic Algalon? Screw you scrub.&quot; &quot;You haven't done Tribute to Instanity? Well then sorry you can't run with us!&quot; &quot;LOL stupid wannabe wants a horde wolf and a nice cloak, isn't that cute. You gotta work for it noob!&quot; It's funny to actually armory HALF if not more of the characters on this site and find out they haven't downed Algalon or even Anub in Heroic TOC, and want to complain about &quot;casual scrubs.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I used to be in a top end guild in Vanilla, and only the assholes in a guild like that talk with others the way you describe, and they are viewed as asshole. To top it off, they do not pug either. They have their select group, thus it isolates us from them, or vice versa. If you are not willing to take the time to do the heroics (which many people fore mentioned), you are simply lazy. Lazier than the &quot;Fat Geek&quot; as someone described who sits on his Iron Bound Proto-Drake. <br />
<br />
He might be a Fat Geek with a Iron Bound Proto-Drake. But you're just a Fat Geek with tear stained cheeks.</div></div><hr />

They care about progression, and the high level of raiding they can experience with others.<br />
Blizzard figured it would be nice to distinguish those that take the time, input the effort and display a high skill level with Proto Drake Rewards.<br />
As you see I mentioned reward, meaning you actually have to do something to get it. <br />
Like putting alot of time in raiding, this does not include flying to scholozar basin every week spending a few gold on an egg. <br />
And if u do get the proto drake from an egg, you're rewarded for your dedication of buying it every week, witouth knowing you'll ever get it. <br />
<br />
This thread reminds me of going to a 3 year old's birthday party, the 5 year old brother gets jealous and also wants presents, to bad it's not his birthday.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nko13</div><div class="date">2009-11-11, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the new PUG, auto groups features, this is very welcome. It will stopped players to stick a spoon inside tanks asses 24/7. Damn it, for christ sake, now to get inside a pug the dude except you to have more than 30K unbuff, or they kick you out... I stopped wow for 4 months just right after Ulduar shipped, I never had problem PUGing with my DK with 28K hp... And that's alrdy by far overgearing heroics... Now they always cry you a river over your hps... And tanks are the only one to get a spoon inside their ass, nobody cares about the priest, druid, or dps... This is really sick.... When WOTLK first shipped, dudes we were running heroics with 21k ish hp....We were even doing achievements with a few epics only, I know I was, I had most of my achievements done, while thoses babies were still leveling up... After a few K more, there is simply no wipes if everyone do their fucking job. Now with 28k you can't wipe, especially since most of the guys in the group, dps or heal will get overgeared anyway.... But people ask you to have more than 30k... They are scared like shit like little boys... I know the game allow 12yo to play, but is there that many?<br />
And basicly the only fact they ask you, that something that is ticking me everytime they ask me my HP for a stupid heroic... I usually answer &quot;I have enought HP, you don't need to know how many&quot;... but still the guy insist, they beg you to equip your tank gear, etc They can see your main stats right after grouping you, while I can't even complain about Kevin AP or Elisabeth Spell Power...That's all in for the Tank... Basicly you can't farm your daily quest, in dps gear, you must stay in tank gear all the time just for thoses littles crying babies...<br />
<br />
Now I had to spend stupid money in the new epic shit gems + change my rune to get the few HP more even if I know deep down that the 4% parry is far better for heroic, JUST TO LOOK GOOD...you know how stupid is this ? I know giving up 4% parry will nerf me, less dps, less mitigation, so slower instance whatever, just to look good... and make that crying leader shut the fuck up...<br />
That's the most insane recent thing I have been forced to do... and That basicly made me give up my gear, because here we are talking about heroics, Im not even trying PUG raids knowing in advance what headache it will cause me...<br />
<br />
Now the bottom line is that the tool will know I have far too many HP to run thoses stupids heroic, and that tool will not whisper me to joke, or look scared about my hp (I actually met people who emotionnaly IRL are scared to run an heroic with a tank full epic with 28k hp).<br />
This tool is great... Now I will be able to hear the jokes about my HP in the party channel and tell them &quot;well if you don't like my HP bar, and fear to kill stupids mobs with 5 people full of epics, when we were doing the same in blues, just leave, and get your cute little deserter Buff&quot;... now I can shove that spoon right back in their ass...<br />
<br />
For info, in all characters I ever played and runned heroics since BC, I have never asked people stats, gear or whatever, that be heal tank or dps, unless the dude was in full blue or lower that the question would make sense to debate...and most of the time I would just tell him it's ok, because I don't see a problem with a tank epic, and heal blues that know how to play, that's just overgearing the instance...<br />
<br />
I will only use this tool now, once it come. What a relief... I don't see why you would need a tank T9/10 for an heroic, that's just plain dumb...<br />
In T7 with my mates we were running the Pinnacle with 3 people...</div></div><hr />
