Lowering the GCD<br />
Lowering the GCD is as close to anything on the never list. We will possibly do it for hunters, but that is because their resource system is going to prevent them from ever spamming multiple buttons at once (in the same way rogues have a lower GCD). Even with rage normalization there are going to be times when a warrior is at 100 rage and can unload with multiple attacks at once. The GCD is there for a reason, partially for game balance and partially to keep the server - client communication from getting gummed up.

<br />
Mandatory Talents<br />
If talents aren't mandatory (for PvE or PvP) then they are considered marginal. If your talent decisions don't actually matter, then that feature becomes a lot less compelling. You could advocate I suppose a design where each individual talent point is even with every other, but given the enormous diversity of situations that you can find yourself in, that's a pretty tall order. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25026566623/subtletly-rogues-and-fire-mages-in-cataclysm/))<br />
<br />
Talent Trees<br />
It was before my time, but the talent trees were developed in response to beta feedback that all say warriors played the same and players weren't making any decisions about how to improve their character beyond a certain point. Maybe 3 wasn't the right number, or maybe the designers should have said that paladins and priests are healers and don't have a damage-dealing mode.<br />
<br />
In any case, those decisions have been made. While we aren't afraid of making a really controversial change if it improves the game, I'm not sure sacrificing some talent trees really does improve the game. It might make PvP or even PvE balance easier to achieve, but it cuts down on the number of ways to play the game or even sheer depth. For every number-obsessed power gamer there are thousands of players who just like their BM hunter or Frost mage and don't care if they can't top meters or win Arena because they're never going to do that content anyway. Those guys could very well be devastated by just taking away the class that they love. I think it's the kind of thing that might cause a big loss of subscribers. It's really had to support as logical any change that might be &quot;good for the game&quot; but causes a lot of people to quit. What does that even mean? (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25026566623/subtletly-rogues-and-fire-mages-in-cataclysm/))<br />
<br />
PvP Balance<br />
I've been trying to stick more with how things should be and what the priority should be in getting there. We want all specs to have a place in PvP (and PvE for that matter). Some players just want to know which are the best PvP classes or specs so they can go play those. Others really like a particular class, say paladin, but really don't want to do some of those roles, say healing. Others like Lhivera really like the playstyle, spells or even just the idea of a particular tree within the class. Some players are fine if they can play their spec without feeling like a total idiot for doing so, while others won't be satisfied unless the dps tracking sites end in a 10-way tie and every tournament has about 30 specs represented.<br />
<br />
All of those things are important to non-trivial slices of our player base so they all have to count for something. They aren't necessarily exclusive either, but a big part of game design, especially the runaway locomotive that is MMO design, is deciding what is the highest priority.

AVR + AVR Encounters removal in 3.3.5 (See this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/avr-mod-broken-in-3-3-5-ssotd-fan-arts/))<br />
We're breaking it because we didn't intend for addons to be able to use the 3D space to automate spacial relations for players. It comes a little closer to &quot;do everything and go everywhere this mod tells you&quot; than anything like it before. The decision wasn't made because there were complaints about it. The decision was made because we don't like that functionality.<br />
<br />
With all of the complaints about the game being too easy, I'd expect endgame raiders like yourself to respect the fact that we don't want addon authors visually telling you exactly where to be and when at all times.<br />
<br />
If you think some sort of spacial recognition feature should be incorporated into the default user interface, it's worth noting on our Suggestions forum. <br />
<br />
[...] Just to be clear, there's a difference between a mod telling you what needs to happen versus showing you. AVR takes the pitch, yaw and roll (if you will) of your character to visually represent where you need to be and when. That's very distinct compared to a tool like DBM playing a &quot;run away little girl&quot; sound file when you're in a danger spot. It's not visually showing you in the 3D game space where to run to get out of danger. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25172037093/avr-+-avre-questions-for-blizz/))<br />

Fixing bugs and dev priority<br />
Yet somehow that is more important than fixing the bugs that people experience numerous times each day. Well I got my answer, they are two separate teams. So yeah, it doesn't matter. I just hope that maybe with the new expansion blizz can devote some of it's ui people to fixing bugs. They seem to be much more efficient.<br />
<br />
It's a lot more than two separate teams. There are content teams which include everything from encounter design to quest design. There are systems teams which include things like UI, class and items design. There are several development leads with several employees reporting to each of them. Each of these teams of employees are very busy working on their specialty. It's not as easy as pulling the UI lead and his team over to focus on gameplay bugs. That's not their specialty and they're not going to be able to address those bugs appropriately, not to mention the fact that it means UI features and fixes would fall behind.<br />
<br />
In addition to the many developers we have sectioned off into specific specialties for creating, fixing and improving content, we have teams of producers managing projects for each of the development teams to ensure appropriate priorities are placed on every task that comes through the pipeline. Believe me, a lot of tasks come through the pipeline and all of these guys are working very long hours these days.<br />
<br />
The functionality of AVR is much more impacting on gameplay than some of the bugs you mentioned as examples earlier. Sure, some of the bugs you listed can be very frustrating when encountered, but the majority of players tend not to encounter those bugs on a regular basis. For instance, getting stuck in a wall when feared really sucks, however, it's extremely rare. It's also extremely difficult to implement an absolute fix so that it never happens again. That one specific example of a bug might actually be hundreds of smaller bugs which fit into the category of a larger bug you happen to notice. Random fear pathing maybe the cause, but the bug might actually exist solely within extremely specific portions of terrain in numerous places throughout the world. Sometimes it's difficult to even reproduce a good number of the bugs reported. Our quality assurance teams work tirelessly to try and verify every bug which gets documented, but some are so quirky we might not be able to replicate the specific situation which caused it to happen.<br />
<br />
A bug that affects maybe 100 people a month, even if it's a bug which causes the game to crash under very specific conditions, will be considered a lower priority than fixing something which allows third-party addons to trivialize raid encounters way more than we would like for tens of thousands of players a week.

Cataclysm Utility of a Shadow Priest<br />
At the moment, Shadow has the 5% spell haste buff, similar to Improved Moonkin Form. That could change as we iterate further on the buff and debuff design.<br />
<br />
This is in addition to Shadow's existing healing debuff and general priest buffs such as Fortitude.<br />
<br />

Passive Fury Talents<br />
You are reading that goal too literally. We want to get rid of passive talents that don't affect your gameplay much. Both Titan's Grip and Single-Minded Fury are passive damage increases but each of them changes your game enormously since they dictate which weapons you'll use. Cruelty, on the other hand, does not. You don't do anything different from before after talenting Cruelty. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25026326560/cataclysm-fury-rotation/))</div></div><hr />

We're breaking it because we didn't intend for addons to be able to use the 3D space to automate spacial relations for players. It comes a little closer to &quot;do everything and go everywhere this mod tells you&quot; than anything like it before. The decision wasn't made because there were complaints about it. The decision was made because we don't like that functionality.<br />
<br />
With all of the complaints about the game being too easy, I'd expect endgame raiders like yourself to respect the fact that we don't want addon authors visually telling you exactly where to be and when at all times.<br />
<br />
If you think some sort of spacial recognition feature should be incorporated into the default user interface, it's worth noting on our Suggestions forum.<br />
<br />
[...] Just to be clear, there's a difference between a mod telling you what needs to happen versus showing you. AVR takes the pitch, yaw and roll (if you will) of your character to visually represent where you need to be and when. That's very distinct compared to a tool like DBM playing a &quot;run away little girl&quot; sound file when you're in a danger spot. It's not visually showing you in the 3D game space where to run to get out of danger. (Source)<br />

Then why not just remove the encounters one, surely it would make more sense if they leave AVR as its a useful tool for raid leaders to draw visualy tatics rather than pinging the map.<br />

AVR trivialised the game beyond reason, it needs to go. I totally agree anything which affects anything beyond your 2D interface layer shouldn't be there, it's pretty much like you're injecting your own models into the game files which is against TOS, just that it's done in a clever way here.</div></div><hr />

Has anyone ever considered how many people are using tanking or other pve specs for BGs or even arena because they are simply too lazy to respec or just don't want to spend the gold? Because the way I see it, they are the majority. The majority isn't people who love pve spec so much that they want to play BGs and arenas with it and be successful. <br />
<br />
The majority is people who just simply have no respect for others and they are just waiting for their guild raid time and they couldn't do anything else besides playing AV on their alts with 10k hp and in full greens pve specced. If someone can figure out some way to make pve specs(tankadins or protection warriors for example) pvp-able then I'm fine with that. However please take into consideration that tanking specs are obviously the specs with by far the most survivability. Now that they have so much powerful utility, it makes this idea directly in contrary with arena balance. It doesn't make sense to have a spec with by far the most survivability, competitive utility and decent burst at a same time and call the game &quot;balanced&quot;. <br />
<br />
I know it must feel important for devs to make everyone happy but IMO, if someone doesn't even want to go through the trouble of respecing, that certain someone doesn't deserve to win. The same logic goes with pvp specs fail on damadge meters.</div></div><hr />

This is a game that YOU should play if you enjoy it, not feel the need to be told where to go and what to do just because some noob decided he wanted that functionality in THEIR gameplay.<br />

It was before my time, but the talent trees were developed in response to beta feedback that all say warriors played the same and players weren't making any decisions about how to improve their character beyond a certain point. Maybe 3 wasn't the right number, or maybe the designers should have said that paladins and priests are healers and don't have a damage-dealing mode.<br />
<br />
In any case, those decisions have been made. While we aren't afraid of making a really controversial change if it improves the game, I'm not sure sacrificing some talent trees really does improve the game. It might make PvP or even PvE balance easier to achieve, but it cuts down on the number of ways to play the game or even sheer depth. For every number-obsessed power gamer there are thousands of players who just like their BM hunter or Frost mage and don't care if they can't top meters or win Arena because they're never going to do that content anyway. Those guys could very well be devastated by just taking away the class that they love. I think it's the kind of thing that might cause a big loss of subscribers. It's really had to support as logical any change that might be &quot;good for the game&quot; but causes a lot of people to quit. What does that even mean?

I'd like to be able to keep AVR functional but break the encounter part.<br />
<br />
Suppose it might not be possible to achieve that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your missing something by just reading this post about AVR. In the original post stating why they are breaking the addon for 2 reasons and it seems people only focus on the encounter part and say that's why they are breaking it. This is from the original post:<br />
<br />
&quot;We’re making this change for two reasons. The invasive nature of a mod altering and/or interacting with the game world (virtually or directly) is not intended and not something we will allow. World of Warcraft UI addons are never intended to interact with the game world itself. This is mirrored in our stance and restriction of model and texture alterations. The second reason is that it removes too much player reaction and decision-making while facing dungeon and raid encounters. While some other mods also work to this end, we find that AVR and the act of visualizing strategy within the game world simply goes beyond what we’re willing to allow. <br />
<br />
The change we’re making in attempts to break the functionality is light in its touch and approach. When blocking any functionality we run the risk of affecting other mods, but we’ve targeted the changes as carefully as possible. If we find that the AVR mod (or any mod attempting to replicate its functions) are usable after 3.3.5 we will take further, more drastic steps.&quot;<br />
<br />
Breaking AVR-E will be what breaks AVR because they are targeting the same function that you would be using for both addons. AVR may be fine and dandy, but you can't stop AVR-E without stopping AVR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those Worgen a result of a Night Elven artifact that's been misplaced in Duskwood. Unlike Gilneans, which suffer from a lycanthropic curse (lycanthropic is not a word), these are simply summons just like a Warlock's demons (from two different places, of course). For all intensive purposes they're mindless abominations.<br />

<br />
<br />
I am not sure, but i don't really think the Blood tree was meant to be DPS only. I think it, and the Frost tree, were made to be Tank or DPS. Now Blizzard has just clarified it for us as to their intentions with those two trees, in making them specific trees.<br />
<br />
I think the whole point of Blizzard doing this is just to give some definition of what they think the classes should be doing with specific trees. Shamans could tank back in the day and are now unable to as they don't have the talent setup for it past 60(i think). Just like Shockadins, you can still do it, and make it work for you in PvP, if you know how to, just not really useful in PvE.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to see a return to truly creative talent specs and even hybrid specs, like Shockadins. Would really add a bit more flavor to the game that it once had.</div></div><hr />

To me that doesn't seem to invasive or makes the game &quot;easymode&quot; anymore than the range readout in current bossmods. You still have to think about where to move, if you have to move, or how far you need to shift to not effect others.<br />
It would be nice if Blizzard allowed that to stay but restricted it so that you can only see the visual representation of range around yourself only.</div></div><hr />

We're breaking it because we didn't intend for addons to be able to use the 3D space to automate spacial relations for players. It comes a little closer to &quot;do everything and go everywhere this mod tells you&quot; than anything like it before. The decision wasn't made because there were complaints about it. The decision was made because we don't like that functionality.<br />
<br />
With all of the complaints about the game being too easy, I'd expect endgame raiders like yourself to respect the fact that we don't want addon authors visually telling you exactly where to be and when at all times.<br />
<br />
If you think some sort of spacial recognition feature should be incorporated into the default user interface, it's worth noting on our Suggestions forum. <br />
<br />
[...] Just to be clear, there's a difference between a mod telling you what needs to happen versus showing you. AVR takes the pitch, yaw and roll (if you will) of your character to visually represent where you need to be and when. That's very distinct compared to a tool like DBM playing a &quot;run away little girl&quot; sound file when you're in a danger spot. It's not visually showing you in the 3D game space where to run to get out of danger. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25172037093/avr-+-avre-questions-for-blizz/))<br />

It opens up all possibilities for any third party mod to allow you to do anything.<br />
<br />
Drawing a series of circles or arrows as an overlay and all the player has to do is follow what the overlay tells them to do is utterly stupid.<br />
<br />
Whilst i wouldn't go as far as to use the word hatred, the idea of the mod is pure retardism because you are not playing the game by looking at what is actually happening, you are simply following instructions that an overlay tells you to do.<br />
<br />
The idea of your RL setting up tactics is irrelevant, because as soon as one person finds the best way to complete an encounter, a template system can be set up for the millions of other players to follow.<br />
<br />
This puts the skilled players who don't use the mod at a distinct disadvantage because your average noob player simply has to follow a series of circles and arrows and instantly becomes pro.<br />
<br />
It is retarded for a game to evolve in this way.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I use powa aura and DBM as the only 2 mods that enhance my encounter awareness. There is a distinct difference between these mods and AVR.<br />
<br />
Where DBM might tell you to &quot;run away&quot; and alert you of an incoming boss ability, AVR goes one step further and not only warns you of that ability but specifically tells you where to move and what to do.<br />
<br />
Powa Aura shows you nothing more than what the standard UI will ever show you, but it has has the functionality of allowing you to move specific buffs/debuffs to wherever you want.<br />
<br />
AVR and AVR-E take away functionality of the actual gameplay and replaces it with a dot-to-dot guide of telling and showing you where to move and what to do without actually making you realise WHY you are doing it.<br />
<br />
Argue all you like, but Blizzard and myself disagree with any arguments that say AVR is a good thing.<br />
<br />
It is retarded and thankfully Blizzard are performing the correct course of action and getting rid of the mod.<br />
<br />
<br />
You just showed me your knowledge of AVR. Let's take DXE bossmods, malleable goo coming in Prof -&gt; it shows an arrow where to go, it isn't a banned addon. You say AVR shows where to move and what to do + showing when the ability is coming, it doesn't do that. Well lets say, Sindragosa HC. 6 blocks coming and we have 6 marks on the ground drawn by our RL. If you get skull you go stand on the skull. We do the same thing with flares, doesn't change a thing. AVR-E does a circle on the ground when prof throws malleable goo, it's cheating I agree. But AVR doesn't do that.<br />
<br />
Only fight where the AVR is helping a lot is Sindragosa, and you can do exactly the same thing with flares. It just helps our RL and makes it faster. That's why I like it. If you can't do the same thing with flares then retardism is beyond my imagination.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that your excuses are like fanboyism. Have to bash something else without knowledge of the topic whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

If an addon has SUCH a huge impact on the fight, that it changes it from pretty difficult, to an easy ride.... it becomes mandatory for every player to install it.<br />

<br />
The thing is that AVR doesn't really tell you anything you don't already know. The same people that can't get out of fires won't get out of fires any more quickly with AVR. Its a crutch. The only place it really helps is with newer raiders. I would think that Blizzard would be supportive of anything that helps make it easier to transition into raiding. If an older raider actually NEEDS AVR then they have issues.</div></div><hr />

Are you truly that freaking clueless? Yes, AVR is the only thing that tells you where to go and what to do in your game play! It has nothing to do with Blizzard at all. Nope, it couldn't possibly be that when you stand in fires or puddles or away from spores you die. IMPOSSIBLE! Just to clue you in, its Blizzard's raid mechanics that tell you where to go and what to do. AVR just warns you when they are coming.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Skilled players who refused to use the mod fell into the dangerous category of being bettered by noobs who were using AVR.<br />
<br />
<br />
BULL SHIT. Its this simple. Either you stand in fires or you don't. AVR will tell you not to stand in the fire, but you already see the fire. If a player can't react to losing 1500 health per second and a bright oarnge glowing object underneath them and DBM screaming at them to get out of the fire...WHAT THE HELL MAKES YOU THINK THEY WILL REACT TO AVR?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In effect 1 person draws up best possible tactics for everyone to use. That is retarded and is something that got nipped in the bud before it happened.<br />
<br />
There's one good reason why the mod should be banned right there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even without this happening, using an overlay is still retarded because it takes away functionality for in-game objects that was designed to do similar things (flares) and it encourages players to follow circles and arrows instead of actually playing the game and looking out for what actually causes the damage to happen.<br />
<br />
There's your second reason why the mod should be banned.<br />
<br />
<br />
The mod also has the potential to turn noobs who can't think for themselves into pro's simply by following on screen overlay instructions given to them by their raid leader. In effect this puts skilled players who don't use the mod at a disadvantage to noobs who do use the mod.<br />
<br />
There's your third reason why the mod is retarded and should be banned.<br />
<br />
<br />
Three good reasons why Blizzard decided to break the mod, and three good reasons i whole-heartedly agree with. Sorry you disagree with Blizz on this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, playing the game properly is something i am a 110% fanboy of 8)<br />
<br />
<br />
Well pretty much the tactics remain the same. So I don't really understand your point there. Before the fight you've seen the videos / pics anyways.<br />
<br />
Besides you're saying that when I have &quot;X&quot; on the ground it makes me not watch DMG, but instead if there is a flare I would? Doesn't make sense at all.<br />
<br />
And I still can't understand how your &quot;noobs&quot; can follow skull, X etc. But they can't follow flares? <br />
<br />
Your whole argument was that it's the same as flares but with colours. I agree that it makes adaption faster, but listening tacts usually does the same thing.<br />
<br />
AVR-E was ridiculous, and I agree that if you need to destroy AVR to break AVR-E, then go for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AVR takes the pitch, yaw and roll (if you will) of your character to visually represent where you need to be and when. That's very distinct compared to a tool like DBM playing a &quot;run away little girl&quot; sound file when you're in a danger spot. It's not visually showing you in the 3D game space where to run to get out of danger.<br />
<br />
It is AVR that tells you where to position your character. Neither Blizzard mechanics nor DBM has this functionality.<br />
<br />
I can understand why you're upset about AVR being broken, but you might find you enjoy the game a little bit more if you actually open your eyes and react to the game graphics rather than circles and arrows and other spacial representations telling you where to move your char ;)<br />
<br />
Guess i wasn't as clueless as you would like me to have been after all 8)<br />
<br />
<br />
Way to be polite, oh wait. You're still ignoring everything everyone is saying, which isn't a big surprise for me. You STILL don't know what you're talking about. AVR isn't the one doing circles when boss throws something on you, it's the same as flare. You can draw something or you can throw a flare, like I've said about one thousand time already. Like I've said, there's ton of addons like DXE (BW if you know how to set it up) that do arrows and circles on the ground. Oh and when we're at it, DBM shows an arrow where the nearest person without the debuf is when Prof throws the plague on you. <br />
<br />
Oh the irony.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keRmis</div><div class="date">2010-06-01, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Everyone&quot; being 2 people :)<br />
<br />
<br />
DBM arrow doesn't give you 3D spacial movement directions. It never tells you where to move your character. AVR does. That is the difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way, the majority of players want to see the mod broken, and Blizzard do not want to see a mod that gives player's 3D spacial directions of where to move their characters.<br />
<br />
Good riddance.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, arrow pointing where you should move isn't telling where you should move? X on the ground on the other hand is? Point being, addon tells you what to do. Now you may do it or you may not, if you want to run further away with your plague then do it, if you want to run somewhere else than your raid leader told you (with X or with flare, or with ping or whatever you use) then do it. Makes a perfect sense. :)<br />
<br />
You might want to consider journalism as your facts are making perfectly sense.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keRmis</div><div class="date">2010-06-01, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DBM never tells you where to go. Ever. Nor do Blizzard game mechanics.<br />
<br />
You need to read this a bit more carefully so you can get it clear in your head exactly what Blizzard is breaking - <br />
<br />
AVR takes the pitch, yaw and roll (if you will) of your character to visually represent where you need to be and when. That's very distinct compared to a tool like DBM playing a &quot;run away little girl&quot; sound file when you're in a danger spot. It's not visually showing you in the 3D game space where to run to get out of danger.<br />
<br />
<br />
And again I say, what's the difference between arrow pointing where you should go and with a mark on the ground? Nothing. You can ignore both of them if you want, but it suggests where you should go. At least AVR is set up by PLAYERS (possibly by your RL). And stop showing that blizzquote again and again. AVR is like a flare with colours, not hard to understand, yet you don't. At least I'm not the one using DBM and bashing other addons because &quot;it makes game too easy &quot; hur dur. (FYI: I'm not using AVR either, I did use it thou.)<br />
<br />
And I don't care what blizzards reasons are, nor do I mourn about the loss. It's just the people always complaining when they have no facts whatsoever. Have a good &quot;hardmode gaming experiences&quot; with your Power auras and DBM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is something that i think you are not quite understanding.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;i completely disabled all of the unbound plague targeting code, all the mod does now is simply announce who it's on and that's it. target aquishition is all up to you now. until we can make it work might as well not confuse people with it.&quot; One mod of DBM said that. Apparantely they disabled it but I think it's there now, cause I had DBM about 3 weeks ago and had it showing that.<br />
<br />
Or then you're still trying to say that arrow pointing out where you should pass the plague isn't showing where you should go. Like X on the ground isn't showing where you should go, set up by players. You can ignore both of them if you want, it might not be the best option but hey, you're the one playing the game.<br />
<br />

<br />
AVR shows you where to move your character. It calculates the x,y and z cordinates and then shows you where to stand or move to in the 3d game area.<br />
<br />
DBM has NEVER done this. All arrows that DBM have ever used it to show you where a team mate is or point to a buff or debuff. It NEVER tells or shows you where to move to or stand.<br />
<br />
The main difference between them is that AVR warns you of danger AND shows you how to avoid it. DBM may point out danger areas but it NEVER takes the choice away from the player as to how they should move. AVR completely takes player choice away, and it changes HOW the player plays the game - In other words, if you simply do as your told without making any choice, AVR will guide you to boss kills anyway.<br />
<br />
The arguments that you make are not debating with me, you are debating with Blizzards descriptions of what functionality they are breaking.<br />
<br />
AVR does something that DBM doesn't. This is what Blizzard are breaking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh my god! I can't believe I'm reading this... You still think that AVR is the one that shows when prof throws malleable goo and warns you. Hahahahaha. It's not AVR, it's AVR-E... Facts, facts, facts. AVR is a mod, where a player can draw a scene and send it to others. AVR-E Does all the fancy stuff on the ground and warns you. AVR is like a flare with colours (again and again). Can't believe someone is bashing addons without knowing what they do... Woah.<br />
<br />
&quot;AVR does something that DBM doesn't. This is what Blizzard are breaking.&quot; By this you're actually saying that DBM is the addon which matters, they balance the addons around it. Which isn't only false is something you can't say.<br />
<br />
&quot;AVR shows you where to move your character. It calculates the x,y and z cordinates and then shows you where to stand or move to in the 3d game area.&quot; Again AVR doesn't do that, AVR is simply a paper where YOU (player) can draw. It doesn't calculate anything, you're still talking about AVR-E. If someone sends you a scene, it doesn't change. The addon is not going to draw ANYTHING by itself, it's just a paper.<br />
<br />
DBM does everything by itself, arrow is calculated and it appears on your screen. AVR doesn't do this, it's drawn by players + it doesn't do anything by itself.<br />
<br />
Please, stop this. Get your facts right before you say anything stupid like that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keRmis</div><div class="date">2010-06-03, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have my facts straight and crystal clear.<br />
<br />
- DBM never provides the functionality that tells you where to go in the 3d game World.<br />
- AVR does.<br />
<br />
That's pretty much all there is to it. It's this functionality that Blizzard are breaking. If you wish to vent more anger over this fact, you need to take it up with Blizzard. <br />
<br />
(You might also wish to educate yourself about what the DBM arrow actually does before you mail Blizzard, because you seem to have it wrong at the moment.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Did I ever say that DBM provides that? No. Did I ever say that AVR doesn't? No. There's something between your eye and brain that is not working as well as you might want it to work. <br />
<br />
But lets see, your facts are straight and &quot;crystal&quot; clear? You just tried to tell me that AVR does decisions for you, warns you and takes the game experience away and pretty much is the worst thing to happen to WoW. Then when I say that you're wrong about it 100 hundred times, explain it to you and still you don't get it. <br />
<br />
And I still can't understand how AVR is making the game so much easier. X on the ground isn't same as a bossmods yelling that something is coming towards you, nor is it an arrow. Only fight that I (and the guild) used AVR was Sindragosa HC, now we use flares (well we don't use anything at this point) and it's as easy as it was. And I can guarantee you. If I'd take your lovely DBM away and replaced it with AVR, you would wipe. Because you see, AVR doesn't warn you, it doesn't show you where you should go. There has to be someone in your guild who will draw it and send it to others and then it will show something, X or a circle on the ground or a huge dong, I'd like to see that helping you to dodge malleable goo.<br />
<br />
And no, I'm not going to take it up with Blizzard. Like I've said, AVR was good, it did nothing bad, but AVR-E is. But people like you, who doesn't have a CLUE about how the addon works are the most pathetic. And as far as I can tell, I was only defending the addon, not attacking towards it.<br />
<br />
And please educate me about your DBM arrow, I hope it helps you a lot in your journey of NOT going the way it's suggesting. This facepalming experience was an eyeopener, peace.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keRmis</div><div class="date">2010-06-03, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The DBM arrow points to buffs/debuffs/players. It's purpose is to take in-game warnings (such as a debuff on a player) and highlight in an easier to read manner where that information is.<br />
<br />
It never tells you something that you can not see by looking at the default Blizzard UI. And it most certainly doesn't point to where it thinks you should be going. It is a simple relay of information that NEVER directs players where to stand.<br />
<br />
AVR on the other hand is an overlay that aims to show players where to move. &lt;----- It is this functionality that Blizzard is breaking.<br />
<br />
<br />
I get it that you don't agree with Blizzards explanation. I, on this occasion fully agree with Blizzards explanation. I guess you will just have to agree to disagree with Blizzards choice. And since i agree with Blizzard, i will just have to agree to disagree with your explanations too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your arguments that DBM arrow provides the same or similar functionality to AVR is nonsense. DBM arrow shows nothing that aspects of AVR do.<br />
<br />
Your arguments that flares provide the same or similar experience to AVR will always fall on deaf ears. Flares are in-game mechanics, crafted by an in-game profession and are a part of the gameplay to use as you wish. They are not a third party mod that provide functionality to show you where to move your character in terms of x,y and z cordinates.<br />
<br />
<br />
If we take away your DBM and flare comparisons, your arguments consist of nothing else but weak QQ about the mod being broken.<br />
<br />
Even if you don't uderstand the concept of the differences between DBM arrow, flares and AVR functionality, it serves you no purpose to continue debating about it anyway. Blizzard are the referees, and the referees decision is final.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're still trying to argue me that DBM arrow isn't showing where you should go, which is false. Why not a /w, why not a message on your screen instead of an arrow? It's made to help you, so you can give it to an another player without going through them in the game (who has lowest stacks closest to me or without the debuff). Sure you can argue all you want that arrow on your screen isn't showing where you should go, like DBM &quot;run you little girl&quot; isn't warning something is coming towards you. Point being, you can just watch the arrow and go where it shows OR you can actually click the players around you / see if there's no stacks. But you're standing on a huge pile of shit if you actually think that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your arguments that flares provide the same or similar experience to AVR will always fall on deaf ears. Flares are in-game mechanics, crafted by an in-game profession and are a part of the gameplay to use as you wish. They are not a third party mod that provide functionality to show you where to move your character in terms of x,y and z cordinates.<br />
<br />
Well I don't know anyone / any guild who would use AVR as something else as a flare. And personally I can't believe if someone would use it otherwise, there's no point nor would it help. <br />
<br />
For the record, I didn't QQ about the mod being broken like you cleverly said (I've said quite much that it's good to break AVR to break AVR-E). But I'm QQing because there's people like you. My &quot;weak argument&quot; is the one argument you can't go around and you tried to tell me that AVR warns you and pretty much takes decision away from the player, which is false. You don't know how the addon works and still you try to tell me it's bad. You haven't said anything that Blizzard hasn't already stated and other you've done is try to cloud me with false information. And now you tell me my argument is weak when you try to get the upper ground with lies. That's weak. <br />
<br />
PS. My AVR vs. DBM was just to show you that DBM makes your game much easier than AVR (if you didn't get it.).<br />
<br />
Now please, if you don't have anything new then just stop. This is quite amusing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AVR does something that DBM doesn't. It provides the functionality via an external overlay to show the player where to position himself in the 3D Game World. This is what Blizzard want to break.<br />
<br />
You then attempted to compare this functionality with DBM's arrow.<br />
<br />
DBM does not provide this functionality. It's something you still seem unaware of. The arrow on DBM NEVER provides the functionality of pointing to a place in the 3D game area that indicates to the player where to stand.<br />
<br />
There is a clear difference between the two functionalities, and ultimately the reason why AVR will be made redundant, but DBM will continue to be made useful.<br />
<br />
I am doing nothing more than describing the blue post for the reasons AVR is to be made broken. If my words aren't readable to you, all you have to do is read the blue comment about it rather than arguing to me why you think the mod shouldn't be broken.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is so amazing. Now you try to be the hero of the story, this was you first statement :<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm glad they are breaking AVR.<br />
<br />
I detested the mod and everything it represented with a passion.<br />
<br />
This is a game that YOU should play if you enjoy it, not feel the need to be told where to go and what to do just because some noob decided he wanted that functionality in THEIR gameplay.<br />

Skilled players who refused to use the mod fell into the dangerous category of being bettered by noobs who were using AVR.<br />
<br />
Not a fair situation at all and Blizzard has the sense to see this and break it.<br />
<br />
<br />
KAPOW - take that you AVR noobs.<br />
<br />
First of all this just showed me that you don't know the addon. After this you clearly described you didn't know the addon and only, like you said, noobs used it. Telling lies is not not describing a blue post. I know why Blizzard breaks it. But you thought it's a failsafe-addon which only noobs use, in reality it didn't help anyone (And I mean 'where to go') else but the type of guy who can pug icc25 up to 6 and leave and they didn't use it in pugs. The bad thing what came of this was AVR-E. It was a mistake, like I've said, it was the one addon which showed where to move. Not AVR. Get your facts right. <br />
<br />
BTW, don't ever say that AVR was destroyed because &quot;AVR does something that DBM doesn't.&quot; (Cause with your logic, every other bossmod which are different should be destroyed) So get your facts right and don't call people &quot;noobs&quot; cause you can't understand the meaning of addon while you're using DBM and Power auras. <br />
<br />
PS. I never said DBMs arrow is in the 3D world, but arrow pointing out does exactly the same thing (it has colours green-red how close you (if I remember correctly)). Can't really understand what's the fuzz here, for me an arrow is as &quot;bad&quot; as showing a mark on the ground and it's just hypocrisy to bash an addon with a great hatred while using addon which points where to go. (I do not imply that's it in the 3D, like I've never said that.) Please do not sink any lower with your &quot;describing&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- AVR has the functionality to tell you where to stand in the 3D Game World &lt;------- Being broken by Blizzard<br />
- DBM arrow NEVER provides the functionality to tell you where to stand in the 3D Game World<br />
<br />
Or to put it another way - <br />
<br />
- One shows you where to stand, <br />
- The other points to areas of danger that you can see with the default Blizzard UI anyway<br />
<br />
<br />
Really, really, really not difficult to understand. If you don't get it from that over-simplistic explanation then i don't what to do with you ???<br />
<br />
Everyone still reading this thread, surely understands your loyalty to AVR. But Blizzard broke it for a reason, there is a blue post describing the exact functionality they are breaking, and my over-simplistic description above explaining why it is being broken.<br />
<br />
Blizzard breaks AVR for above reason. DBM doesn't get broken, because the DBM arrow doesn't provide this functionality. There is nothing more to it than that. That is it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Way to miss a highlight, let's see. &quot;but arrow pointing out does exactly the same thing (it has colours green-red how close you are (if I remember correctly))&quot;. Do you work in a media? You just left out maybe the most important part of that quote, way to go. And you can't say you can't stand in the right position with the default UI (what AVR is &quot;helping&quot;), which I am doing. <br />
<br />
Stop the hero act, it just makes you look more like an idiot. Your statements have been aggressive or lies, only point you are making is that AVR is in the 3D world and DBM isn't, which is not the point of my responses, thought you would have got that by now. I'll make it clear to you, I dislike people like you. False facts, lying, to try to get your point through. <br />
<br />
Btw, I've understood your &quot;facts crystal clear&quot;, they just don't make sense. Like I've said about thousand times already, I don't have a problem with Blizzard breaking AVR, I have a problem with you. Next time come back with better argumentation skills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you read through all our comments to each other, you might be surprised to see that the only person who is name calling, insulting and accusing is you.<br />
<br />
The person who does that is normally the person to get frustrated because instead of arguing the case in question, you try and argue against the person and try to win at whatever cost to &quot;save face&quot;.<br />
<br />
Blizzard broke AVR because it provided functionality they didn't agree with. You can argue about it until you are blue in the face, but all that will happen is you will get frustrated because you are in a winless position. The decision to break it for a specific reason has already been made irregardless of what you say.<br />
<br />
Bring more name calling on though, it bothers me not. I am beginning to think you are the butthurt author of the mod, because only someone who has devoted so much time into creating the mod could beat the dead horse for as long as you have.<br />
<br />
<br />
Read your first post on this section, you just called over 20k people a noob. Oh the irony. I don't recall &quot;name-calling&quot; you, I just observed your arguments and made a conclusion from that, oh and if you're talking about the eye-&gt; brain function I can't help but to laugh at it, brilliant from me. It's just my strategy, like blasphemy, but not. <br />
<br />
I don't need to &quot;save my face&quot;, I'm not the one lying here. Just keep posting your Blizz quote, I know why it's destroyed, I never argued against that, I argued against your knowledge / logic. (eye-&gt;brain). <br />
<br />
&quot;You can argue about it until you are blue in the face, but all that will happen is you will get frustrated because you are in a winless position.&quot; Priceless. I think you're at this position and I could say that someone might agree with me. You can't win an argument with lies and blizz quotes. Next time when you're in an argument, try to bring more facts and less lies on the table, might help your... cause, if I may say. Btw, that quote is going to be my signature. <br />
<br />
PS. Seriously, read what I've written and you might understand what I'm arguing against. Reminding me over and over again why Blizz is breaking AVR isn't really helping your &quot;image&quot;.</div></div><hr />
