Cataclysm Beta - Hunter &amp; Warlock Pet Data Wipe Inbound<br />
During the standard beta realm maintenance on Thursday morning, we will be wiping all pet data for hunters and warlocks to fix a data corruption issue. Hunters will need to tame new pets as a result of this change, while warlocks should simply notice that their pets' names have changed.<br />

New Cataclysm Beta Launcher FAQ<br />
<br />
Below you will find the answers to common questions about the new Launcher being added this week. For more information and discussion, please review this announcement: https://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=26262801168&amp;sid=2000<br />
<br />
Q. How much data is in each stage for a full Cataclysm installation?<br />
A. In general, about 5% of the data is red (required), about 70% of the data is yellow (base gameplay), and about 25% of the data is green (extended data).<br />
<br />
Q. How is data assigned to each stage?<br />
A. Data is assigned to each stage based on the relative need for that data. Red is required to get into the game, yellow is data needed for base gameplay, and green is for variants of base game data (higher-resolution graphics, alternate sounds, other flavor data).<br />
<br />
Q. How do I know when the entire game is downloaded?<br />
A. The progress bar will reach 100%, and then will not be shown on subsequent launches (until there is a new patch released).<br />
<br />
Q. Will I still be able to download patches from mirror sites?<br />
A. Yes, standalone patches will still work.<br />
<br />
Q. Will the downloader still use P2P / bittorrent?<br />
A. Yes.<br />
<br />
Q. Will large patches still be downloadable in advance through the background downloader?<br />
A. Yes.<br />
<br />
Q. Will it be possible to download the entire game before I begin playing it?<br />
A. Yes.<br />
<br />
Q. Is this mandatory?<br />
A. No. Users will have the option of playing before all game data is downloaded and applied. They may choose to enter the game, or they may choose to wait.<br />
<br />
Q. On patch days, will I be able to start the patch download before the realms are back up?<br />
A. Yes.<br />
<br />
Q. You are requiring a reinstall of the beta client. Does this mean I will have to reinstall my WoW retail client when I buy Cataclysm?<br />
A. No. As with the prior two expansions, there will be a lengthy patching process to migrate users from the prior major version (3.0) to the new major version (4.0). Data for this patch will be downloaded in advance via the background downloader.<br />
<br />
Q. Will I still be able to download a patch once and copy it to multiple machines?<br />
A. Yes, as long as you have fully downloaded the entire patch. However, as with the prior expansions, patches from a previous major version (all patches prior to 4.0) will not work with the new major version.<br />
<br />
Q. What if I have a low bandwidth connection?<br />
A. After the initial beta release, users with connections below 1 MB/sec will be required to download all data before entering the game. Users with connections above 1 MB/sec will have the option of entering the game before all data has been downloaded and applied. Users at any bandwidth may exit the game and resume the download if they find the play experience undesirable.<br />
<br />
Q. How will this affect new characters logging in for the first time?<br />
A. If a player chooses to enter the game while content is still downloading, data for the introductory race video and zone fly-through will be applied at the loading screen to ensure a smooth game introduction. This is currently only functional for new worgen characters. Other races have not yet been optimized, which may lead to issues with the opening fly-through if they are loaded while content is still being downloaded. <br />

In-Game Footage as Cinematics<br />
Sort of taking it off subject to to start with, but it's inevitable that eventually computer graphics will reach the point where there's no such thing as pre-rendered cinematics. But we've all been hearing that for a while, and while we are getting closer, we're definitely not there yet.<br />
<br />
We don't think we are. We don't pretend we are, and our in-house cinematics department is bigger than ever working on cinematics that are better than ever.<br />
<br />
Regarding World of Warcraft - Each World of Warcraft release, including the initial and subsequent expansions, has had a single cinematic. It's what plays when you first launch the game. This intro-cinematic approach has been done primarily because, as an MMO, pulling players out of a multiplayer environment where anything could be going on at the time they hit the point where the cinematic could play is risky. Say you're PvP flagged and a cinematic starts to play. Or you happen to be having a very heated discussion in guild chat, etc. etc. It's not an ideal play space to be popping up full screen videos. The story was intended to play out within the game world itself through text, voice, and effects.<br />
<br />
With Wrathgrate we tried something new. Using our in-house video team which had been making many of the machinima trailers for us (most of which can be found here http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/movies.html) for promotional use, as well as commercials, the South Park episode, on and on, instead used it as a way to show events to the player in a more cinematic approach. We had come a long way and with new technology a lot of the previous concerns were either completely squashed or had working solutions to remove a lot of the potential aggravation caused by interrupting the game.<br />
<br />
The response was extremely positive. People really enjoyed it, and so it was used again as a way to give Arthas a more epic and cinematic end. Certainly befitting of a King. (Kael and Illy should have been so lucky...)<br />
<br />
So, those are not pre-rendered cinematics, they're clearly using in-game assets, we don't claim otherwise. However, we do claim that they are completely kick ass and know that most people enjoy what they add to the game. Key word 'add', because they are truly additions which took nothing away from the intro cinematic each release has had.<br />
<br />
The Wrathgate and Fall of the Lich King allowed us to really take it up a notch and deliver something spactacular.<br />
<br />
Now, on to the subject of StarCraft II - In our opinion it also has amazing cinematics. The in-engine story telling in StarCraft II, which you say has detracted from the cinematics, is comparative to this - http://i616.photobucket.com/albums/tt243/bashiok/855f805c.jpg from the original StarCraft.<br />
<br />
We think we've come a long way.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, we still have an incredibly talented cinematics team and we'll continue to produce the amazing pre-rendered cinematics you've come to know and love. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262771659/in-game-footage-as-cinematics-nerd-rage/))<br />

Retribution Rotation<br />
The rotation won't be 121212 under any circumstances.<br />
<br />
At the very basic level you could call it 1112111311121113 but almost every class boils down to something similar if you ignore all of the other talents and abilities. What will keep Ret from falling into a rotation that stable are:<br />
<br />
1) Having to manage other attacks. Judgement isn't the kind of button you eventually get around to using.<br />
2) Getting Holy Power coming in at somewhat unpredictable (but not completely random) intervals.<br />
3) Dealing with procs like Art of War.<br />
<br />
Seals do way too much damage on live and in Cataclysm. We haven't worried about that damage yet because we're still working out a basic rotation that feels good. We also are mindful that deemphasizing white attacks of any kind risks making haste less attractive.

It is only me, or did they dump that idea total and used machina videos for cheaper production in lich king? If the above isn´t true anymore, why not some more real cinematics? And why on earth he even mentioned concepts that did not apply since ages?<br />

<br />
<br />
From what I can tell, this new streaming client nonsense doesn't affect anyone who isn't already in the beta. Come Cataclysm, all it means is that you can play the game faster without waiting for the entire expansion or patch to download and install. <br />
<br />
If I'm wrong, please do correct me on this!<br />
<br />
Edit: If by &quot;1 MB/s download speed&quot; they mean more then 1 MB/s download speeds from their Bittorrent trackers they had better get ready to revise that.<br />
<br />
Its not their trackers that have issuses, its alot of isps like I guess mine AND yours who downgrade your speed for p2p traffic. Net neutrality seems to be a concept of the past. Blizzards network is fast enough, just disable p2p in their download client and your downstream will increase to about 2.5mb, sometimes it even use my whole bandwidth … just not if I use p2p, same server ip, just a different protocol.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, I thought I heard something crazy in my ear. They can't seriously be thinking about changing Ret back into a Proc based class with few options. The only problem with that model was FREAKING ALL OF IT (See: All of tBC. Seriously, go look).<br />

Or did Ghostcrawler miss the point of the post, being that the whole reason why the rotation looks like it does is due to 2) and 3)? I don't know...</div></div><hr />

Thats normal egyptian bird statue. I dont see any reason why it should suffer from immature behavior of wow players and thus being redesinged. Grow up or get proper sexual education.<br />
<br />
New Cataclysm Beta Launcher : So, when will Blizz get some guts and implement rootkit into launcher to prevent keylogging ? We even had (rare one, i know) example of &quot;authentificator fail&quot;, as that was clearly issue of keylogging.<br />
<br />
In-Game Footage as Cinematics : So, we had none, noone cared. We have two based on ingame engine - nerd rage about dropping quality ? Come on, if you want movie, wait for one that is being planned. That was huge jump from none to some and just becouse its not movie quality i am not going to lynch Blizz, i like both Wrathgate and LK fall.</div></div><hr />

Cataclysm currently has no cinematic. What it does have is a lot of in-game scenes strung together and to be blunt it's not what a lot of people seem to want to see.<br />
<br />
The cinematic is supposed to be something awe-inspiring; WotLK's was definitely not. In-game cutscenes are a nice thing to include in the odd dungeon or event but not the death of the expansion's iconic boss. It should've been a full cinematic.</div></div><hr />

If the above isn´t true anymore, why not some more real cinematics? And why on earth he even mentioned concepts that did not apply since ages?<br />
<br />
What are you talking about? Wotlk was the expansion to have ANY FORM OF CINEMATICS IN-GAME. A number of in-game cinematics were used for both trailers and in-game.<br />
Vanilla didn't have anything of the sort at all, and only the intro cinematic.<br />
TBC didn't have any of the sort either, only the intro cinematic, and I didn't see you cry about that.<br />
<br />
What cheaper production would there be to talk about? Are you suggesting that Wotlk didn't add features? Are you suggesting Wotlk was smaller then TBC?<br />

A full grown cinematic is probably too expensive for a free content patch. Plain and simple.</div></div><hr />

I most certainly think TBC was bigger than WotLK, both content-wise and lore-wise.<br />
Even tho Draenei crap.<br />
WotLK have been nothing but pure boredom.. I for myself only played 'til about mid of Ulduar patch, then quit and recently started again(1 week ago) due to the fact that Cata is &quot;soon&quot; coming out.<br />

I then end up using Templar's Verdict whenever I don't have to put Inquisition back up. I like it, the whole hybrid rotation/FCFS with finishers thing feels really fast paced and reactive.<br />

That's not because Wotlk was boring but because you've grown out of the game. That's natural, you can't keep liking the same thing forever.<br />

Doesn't change the fact that TBC only had its intro cinematic and nothing else in that department.<br />

<br />
Fact still remains, Illidan never got an epic awesome in-game cutscene at all. Wotlk did.<br />
<br />
Not sure you all know the time and numbers it takes to create a cinematic of Blizzard quality.<br />

Another fact still remains: The WoW community is still the most spoiled, egotistical, dumb people in a community I've come across outside the animé community (marginally worse but in other ways).<br />

<br />
Not that I really have any particular issue with pirating music and games, mind you... it's just that most ISPs can't be simple tunnels anymore when the most common use of P2P protocols is to steal content.<br />
<br />
And legally download video games, and legally download Open Source Operating Systems, and even legally download music and other media that's been released into the public domain. The problem is essentially that peer to peer systems are the most efficient way to distribute data ever designed. the fact that it CAN be use for illegal purposes is totally immaterial to that. Obviously people illegally exchanging data want to do it as fast as possible. So do all of the many legitimate users of P2P technology. <br />
<br />
Making a useful technology completely impractical to use, simply because it can be used for something illegal, is exactly why we need Net Neutrality laws.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nonsense. It is not about piracy, it is about bandwidth. P2P traffic is huge, traffic ain´t free and providers want to keep there flat rate cheap, which means they have to keep traffic per user low. If your argument would be valid, I could not simply ask you why a lot of isp do exactly the same with voip, blocking it complete, denied usage in their terms of use or use QoS filters and set it to low priority &#8230; sure, that are only those isps that offer regular phone services themselves, especial mobile carriers. Regular providers set voip even on high priority in their QoS, but these days p2p every often on low &#8230; again, brave new world without net neutrality, it is only a small step from here to start to surpress content at all. <br />
<br />
Have not paid your isp the gaming extra? Well, bad luck than, only 300ms ping to blizzard servers, but for 5$ extra they can fix this &#8230; *grumble, swear* , t-online did this some years ago already :D</div></div><hr />

I wasn't complaining just noting there was some use of the technique in TBC<br />

and from an &quot;engaging&quot; point of view - the Wrath Gate cinematic was, in my opinion, a lot better than LK's<br />

and lastly, any defense of blizzard based on time/effort/resources is a sign of fanboyitism considering the wads of cash they have and continue to make off of WoW... :)</div></div><hr />

ACtually looking at that statue and thinking about a penis isnt 1 or 2nd grade at all. Thats more of a high school level where most of the WoW player base is. Sorry to say when I first saw that I thought of a penis aswell ( Or a double vibrator), but that doesnt mean im immature .</div></div><hr />

Ret paladin on live is NOT OP. It's easy to play fairly decently by just mashing a rotation, but if you want to do good, it again takes situational thinking, knowing when to use abilities or save them etc like any other class.<br />
<br />
DKs, I think on the other hand, play really bad if you just do no thinking rotations like that, but are about the same good if you are smart. Just a higher threshold of easy play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wanted to stop reading after the first sentence and they go through whatever means needed to smack/punch you through the internet. But I digress. You've never played a Ret paladin (or anything other kind of paladin. Or anything similar), so I doubt you know the intricacies of their rotation, their itemization and their weaknesses. So going into such would be a waste of time.<br />
<br />
Yes, Blizzard is trying to add depth the playing the class. However they seem to be going the wrong away about it and the original poster was expressing this, to which Ghostcrawler thankfully replied (means he saw it, it's been acknowledged and should something go wrong he and the rest of the dev team would be more inclined to fix it). It's no different than all the Hunters talking about Focus and such.<br />
<br />
One of the many kinks that comes with this thing called 'beta-testing'.<br />
<br />
<br />
The sad thing is they let whiners like you into the beta, instead of someone like me who would give feedback to improve the flaws *sigh*<br />
<br />
I think you mean to say 'get rid of the flaws' or relay something else that doesn't sound like you're going to add onto the flaw pile. &gt;.&gt; Not the point.<br />
<br />
I may end up regretting this, but if you get onto the beta and you continue say things like that you're not staying in the beta long enough. Because a lot of what you said was stupid not constructive. They're looking for people willing to go into the innards of certain class mechanics and record every cog and kink they can find, not those making blanket statements that don't help anyone (and probably piss off that one loser who posts too much).<br />
<br />
<br />
Addendum: There's only been Paladin news for the past 2 days, briefly touching on two different spec flaws. In comparison to how much attention Paladins got right before Wotlk this is hardly a News Overload (or even a news injection? lol).<br />

<br />
Yes, their mana changed into focus and it changes how the class plays to some degree. On the other hand, all the hunter rotations, spells, and even talents are almost identical to Wrath.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, 80% of the Paladin spells, 80% of the Paladin talents, and almost every part of all three specs' rotations are completely redesigned. You tell me who had a bigger redesign. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ret as it is on live now is stupidly OP and doesn't require any thinking or strategy, Blizzard is trying to add depth and skill to playing a ret paladin to make it more engaging and interesting to play and people complain about that as well...<br />
<br />
The sad thing is they let whiners like you into the beta, instead of someone like me who would give feedback to improve the flaws *sigh*<br />
<br />
You are not in Beta, so you don't have any idea how cluncky Art of War and holy power build up feels right now. <br />
Paladins op in live? Oh yes definatly, thats why they dominate every arena bracket...oh wait.<br />
No thinking or strategy? The other classes do require that? All dps classes have been narrowed down to pressing 3-4 buttons during a fight.<br />
<br />
Do you think a pala is an engaging experience in the beta? Think again, its just the same ol button mashing with slightly more downtime then on live. You will only notice that your survivability in pvp is now 0 and all your moves make the same horrible mangle sound.</div></div><hr />
