Icecrown Citadel Changes in latest build<br />
The latest PTR build changed Icecrown Citadel, but this time we're talking about the outdoor appearance of the citadel. It now looks MUCH taller and a new structure has been added at the top ... If you remember the early screenshots of the citadel I posted you might recognize the location.<br />
<br />

<br />
New Dungeon System<br />
In the upcoming content patch there are many new additions and improvements. Perhaps one of the largest changes is the introduction of the new dungeon system. This new system will be available for all dungeons. A “Dungeons” button will replace the Looking For Group feature currently available in-game, and provides additional benefits to those who use it.<br />
<br />
System Highlights:<br />
Join as a Group or Solo<br />
Cross-Realm Instances/Grouping<br />
Instance Teleporting<br />
Smarter Group Matching<br />
Daily Random Dungeons<br />
Repeat Random Dungeons<br />
Choose Multiple Dungeons<br />
Vote Kick system<br />
Lovin’ the PUG Bonuses<br />
Looking For Raid<br />
Need Before Greed Updated<br />
Group Disenchanting<br />
<br />
Join as a Group or Solo<br />
Much like the current Looking For Group system, players will be able to join the dungeon system and choose the role they would like to fill within groups: Healing, DPS, or Tank. In addition, once roles have been identified, they will be applied to all dungeons chosen. Players will now be able to choose multiple dungeons and will no longer be limited to three. The system has also improved group creation and matchmaking capabilities and will create more balanced groups when assessing the selected roles of players.<br />
<br />
The LFG channel has been disconnected from the dungeon tool and can be used by anyone in a major city, much like the trade channel currently available.<br />
<br />
Cross Realm Instances<br />
When joining the dungeon system as a solo player or with a partial group, additional random players can be found within the same Battlegroup via cross-realm instancing.<br />
<br />
While the new system offers the ability to group with player from other realms within your Battlegroup, you won’t be able to use this to manually invite specific players to groups.<br />
<br />
Instance Teleporting<br />
When you use the dungeon tool to find a dungeon, you’ll get ported to the inside of the dungeon, much like the current Battleground system. When you leave the instance, you will be returned to your previous location. If you need to leave temporarily, such as for repairs or to purchase reagents, you can teleport back to the dungeon again. This feature can be used both by groups looking for other players and by premade groups of five who use the dungeon tool.<br />
<br />
Smarter Group Matching<br />
The new system will now work to match at least one experienced player for the assigned dungeon with less experienced players in the group. It will more carefully match class types, and will more consistently match players of equal levels for the dungeon chosen. The interface will also allow players to see how many players are looking for groups as well as the average wait time of groups that the tool has formed.<br />
<br />
Daily Random Dungeons<br />
Players or groups can choose specific dungeons or they can instead take their chances with a random Heroic or random normal dungeon. Picking randomly conveys some additional benefits. If you defeat the final boss in a dungeon, you receive 2 Emblems of Frost for Heroic dungeons and 2 Emblems of Triumph for normal dungeons. In addition, after players have received 2 Emblems of Frost for the first Heroic dungeon they do in a day, they will earn 2 Emblems of Triumph for each additional random Heroic dungeons in that day. These random rewards replace the current daily dungeon and daily Heroic dungeon quests. The current NPCs who offer those quests will offer weekly repeatable raid quests instead. You can also earn level-appropriate rewards for running random pre-Wrath of the Lich King dungeons while you are leveling up.<br />
<br />
Lovin’ the PUG<br />
Players who take part in groups with one or more members who have been matched with them randomly from within the dungeon system will receive extra rewards, including the coveted Perky Pug non-combat pet. The more random players you group with, the faster you could get your new pet!<br />
<br />
Vote Kick<br />
Players who use the system to find additional random members for their party will be afforded a couple of extra conveniences to help them perform well. The loot option is fixed to the updated Need Before Greed option (and unalterable by any member) and players can vote to remove another party member from the group. It will take four votes in order to remove someone, however, so consider this newfound power carefully.<br />
<br />
Looking for Raid<br />
There will be a new option available to players that can be accessed via the raid information screen in the interface or by typing /lfr. Players will also be able to take part in raid-specific weekly quests and will be able to browse the system manually for any other players looking for a raid dungeon group.<br />
<br />
Need Before Greed Updated<br />
Need Before Greed will now recognize gear appropriate for a class in three ways: the class must be able to equip the item, pure melee will be unable to roll on spellpower items, and classes are limited to their dominant armor type (for example, plate for paladins). All items will still be available via greed rolls should no member be able to use the item as well as the new disenchant option will be available for all parties.<br />
<br />
Group Disenchanting<br />
Players in a group with an enchanter will now have the option to automatically disenchant any items that are not claimed by a player from within the loot window. Players will have this option available to them in both premade groups and in randomly matched groups. This option is available in any loot system, even if players don’t use the new dungeon tool.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Disenchanting in Dungeons in Patch 3.3<br />
As we mentioned in the recent post explaining the new Dungeon System, disenchanting will work a little differently in all 5 player and raid dungeons when patch 3.3 is released. We have seen a consistent pattern where players eventually need very few items from dungeons and they result to disenchanting as much of the loot as possible since those materials that can be obtained continue to have a lot of worth.<br />
<br />
When the new Dungeon System is launched, the default user interface will give players the option to automatically disenchant items that they obtain in 5 player and raid dungeons. This option will avoid the hassle of having items picked up by an enchanter first to redistributed later and overall will make the process much smoother.<br />
<br />
Also, with the inclusion of cross-realm-instancing in the dungeon system, there will be restrictions on trading items similar to the restrictions that are currently active in Battlegrounds. If the Dungeon System is used to complete a group for a dungeon then non-temporary items will not be able to be traded in the instance. This makes it so items like enchanting materials will not be able to be traded in the dungeon and using the new user interface option will be the only way to distribute disenchants. There will be some exceptions to this restriction though as Bind-on-Pickup items will continue to be trade-able to those present for the kill for a short duration and completely pre-formed groups that don’t use the Dungeon System to form the group will still allow trades.<br />
<br />
To maintain the importance of the profession itself, the disenchanting UI option will only be available for groups that have a character with the necessary level of Enchanting to disenchant the items that are obtained.<br />
<br />
We are very excited about the upcoming improvements in the new Dungeon System and don’t forget to check out the full preview here for all the details: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=20677771774&amp;sid=1 <br />

Icecrown Raid Schedule Update<br />
No testing in Europe on Friday ... Could be the sign of an early PTR build on this day, definitely wouldn't be surprising on a friday. <br />
We are scheduling raid tests in Icecrown Citadel for October 26-30.<br />
<br />
The schedule is as follows:<br />
<br />
US Servers<br />
Thursday, October 29 at 7PM EDT / 4PM PDT – Sindragosa<br />
Friday, October 30 at 7PM EDT / 4 PM PDT - Valithria Dreamwalker<br />
<br />
EU Servers<br />
Thursday, October 29 at 18:30 CET – Rotface<br />
<br />
Only normal difficulties will be tested, although 10 and 25 player raids will be available.<br />
<br />
The Icecrown Citadel raid test schedule will be very flexible, and can change at a moment's notice due to build status, bugs, and server issues. Remember that this is the test server, so things can, do, and will break from time to time. Check this forum for the latest Icecrown Citadel raid testing schedule information in the weeks to come.<br />
<br />
[edit] Correcting testing times for EU realms as we are now in Winter time (CET) :-)<br />
[edit] Moved Rotface up, rescheduling Putricide for next week.<br />

Emblems in 3.3<br />
The Daily Random Heroic will award two Emblems of Frost upon completion (can be done once a day). The Daily Random normal dungeon will award two Emblems of Triumph upon completion (can be done once a day). If players continue to select &quot;Random&quot; via the Dungeon System when running Heroic dungeons after the Daily Random Heroic dungeon has been completed, they will receive two additional Emblems of Triumph for each random Heroic dungeon completed.<br />
<br />
Emblems of Frost will drop in the 10- and 25-player Icecrown Citadel raid... and perhaps if another boss stumbles into the Vault he'll drop them as well. ;) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677351931-can-you-do-the-random-daily-with-a-nonpug.html))<br />
<br />
[...] If you complete the Daily Random Heroic dungeon for the day to earn two Emblems of Frost in addition to the Emblems of Triumph which drop off of each Heroic boss, you can continue to select the &quot;Random&quot; option for Heroics in the Dungeon System. Doing so will award you with two Emblems of Triumph upon completion of each dungeon in addition to the Emblems of Triumph which drop off of each Heroic boss. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677351931-can-you-do-the-random-daily-with-a-nonpug.html))<br />

Healing<br />
Healing has always been challenging and to some extent thankless in WoW. I don't think LK fundamentally changed that.<br />
<br />
When I heal, I like to be challenged. Just buffing healing overall, or taking some of the challenge away from the healers, I don't think makes the game more fun for them. It might be fun for a week as everyone thanks you for doing such an amazing job all the time, but playing any game in godmode typically gets old after the initial rush.<br />
<br />
What I mean is that one of the most boring experiences I can have in the game is to be a healer for a milk run in which a wipe is unlikely and nobody is going to take much damage. By contrast, you can still have fun in that situation as a DPS spec. You can see how fast the boss dies. You can see how much damage you can do. It can even be fun as a tank, because you can usually afford to drop some of your defenses in order to improve your dps and try and make the fight shorter. At the very least, you can try and see how much damage you can mitigate. It's possible to do some pulls and even weaker bosses with almost no incoming damage. All a healer can really do is try to heal as little or efficiently as possible, which really just means you're standing around a lot. Maybe you're tossing the occasional Wrath or SW:Pain or something, but that dps contribution is pretty trivial even compared to the trying-to-DPS-a-little tank.<br />
<br />
Where I will agree we need to improve healing in WoW is in relationship to how much damage the tank is taking (or even a teammate in PvP). Damage to health is too high in almost all scenarios, such that only the really big, really fast, or really broad (group-based) heals count for much. Things that are fun for a healer, such as trying to be mana-efficient or matching the right heal to the right damaged character go away when you're just spamming like mad. None of this should come as news to readers of this forum, because it's the kind of thing we've said before.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see in Cataclysm is higher health pools but also lower heals (and tank avoidance) overall. Hopefully everyone won't be on the verge of almost dying, yet the risk of overhealing will be more real such that you can't just madly spam all of the time if you want to make it to the end of the encounter.<br />
<br />
A similar thing is true for PvP. If health pools are larger, but heals smaller, then you see folks with health in between 100% and 0% more often. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/20126982438-healing-nerfs--stop-it.html))<br />
<br />
Designing Raid encounters around heals<br />
While that sounds good on &quot;paper,&quot; my fear is that you would see groups just swapping all their healers out for paladins on boss 1 and then for shaman on boss 2. If you look at all of the mechanics of an encounter, you'll notice that the designers spend a lot of attention on trying not to prop up any single class or role too much. For example, there are not many LK encounters that scream &quot;replace all your casters with melee&quot; or &quot;drop all of our melee for three more tanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
To be honest, I'd much rather it go the opposite direction and players stop approaching raid invites as &quot;They'll want me because my class is so awesome,&quot; and instead &quot;They'll want me because I'm good.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/20126982438-healing-nerfs--stop-it.html))<br />
<br />
Dungeon System<br />
Need Before Greed and caster items<br />
We knew this change was going to be controversial, and we totally understand that e.g. cloth can be an upgrade for a Balance druid or leather can be an upgrade for a shaman.<br />
<br />
Looting to some extent is always going to have a heavily social component. There's only so much we can do (or should do) to try and &quot;solve&quot; that problem for players. On the other hand, the new LFG system also removes some of the social checks and balances (not that those are huge to begin with) by potentially grouping you with folks you may never see again. On my server, perennial ninjas and jerks earn a reputation. That's going to be harder when you're talking about a battle group. Overall we expect players to just pug a lot more often, because the new system really is that good. So overall the drama over who gets the healing shoulders might arise more often. :(<br />
<br />
Ultimately, our logic went like this: If a Holy paladin loses a great non-plate upgrade to another player, one out of five players might feel bad. If a Holy paladin rolls Need on every type of armor that drops, then four out of five players might have a bad experience. The jerk potential seemed worse than the lost-an-upgrade potential as far as whether or not players buy into using the new dungeon tool.<br />
<br />
You can still Greed a potential upgrade item. You can still talk to your group and explain that X is an awesome item for you and would they mind passing on it or even trading it? (You can trade BoP items for a short period of time following the same rules that apply today.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/20677581818-man-i-really-need-that-mail-piece-sigh.html))<br />
<br />
[...] Yes. I'm not sure if everyone realizes that. Need Before Greed is forced when you add random players to a 5-player group. You can use whatever loot system you choose when you use /invite to form the group.<br />
<br />
To try and improve the pug experience (at least pugs formed through the tool) we wanted to try and minimize jerkish behavior, and that includes not giving the leader a whole lot of power. I'm not talking about a player who thinks it's funny to pull the entire instance and wipe you. I'm talking about players who legitimately want to run the dungeon but have very non-conventional ideas about leadership or loot distribution. We are trying to impose a little bit of convention on these groups so that everyone has a better pug experience. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/20677581818-man-i-really-need-that-mail-piece-sigh.html))<br />
<br />
[...] Need before Greed is changed everywhere. From our research, very few groups use this loot system. (I'm sure some do, and you don't need to post to tell us that it's your favorite loot system.) Most groups use some variant of Group Loot (the current default) or Master Looter. If you use Group Loot, you can still Need on anything you want. You just can't use Group Loot on a pug formed with the Dungeon tool. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/20677581818-man-i-really-need-that-mail-piece-sigh.html))<br />
<br />
LFG Channel in Patch 3.3<br />
The Looking For Group channel will return in patch 3.3. If you wish to run dungeons with players on your realm, you can use the Looking For Group channel in any major city to create the party. [...] It works exactly like the Trade channel currently does. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677231801-say-no-to-crossrealm-instancing.html))<br />
<br />
Daily Random Heroic Dungeon with people from your realm<br />
That's not true by the way. You can form a group of five players, have the party leader open the Dungeon System and select the Random Heroic option. The pre-made group will be able to port to the selected instance, not be bound by any of the cross-realm restrictions (such as mandatory Need Before Greed, trade restrictions, Vote Kick, etc.), and will receive the daily reward for completing the dungeon. Your pre-made group could continue to select the Random Heroic option again and again to continue running any Heroic that pops up each time -- even if a Heroic dungeon pops up that you've already done -- and you will continue to get loot and Emblems of Triumph from each boss, plus two additional Emblems of Triumph for completing the random Heroic instance. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677231801-say-no-to-crossrealm-instancing.html))<br />
<br />
Dungeon System and Ignore List<br />
And hey, the Ignore list is being expanded! You can also ignore players on other realms if you have a bad group experience with them. The Dungeon System will not place you in a group with any character on your Ignore list. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677231801-say-no-to-crossrealm-instancing.html))<br />
<br />
Random Dungeon Group creation speed<br />
If you jump into the new Dungeon System tool, you likely won't have time to do much before finding a group. Groups will be created quite rapidly in most cases, particularly if the Random Dungeon option is chosen. If you don't want to use this system because you might have to play with people not on your realm, you're only restricting yourself. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677231801-say-no-to-crossrealm-instancing.html))<br />
<br />
Ninjas in random groups<br />
As far as ninjas go, the default loot system will be Need Before Greed and cannot be changed if the group is cross-realm. The Need Before Greed system will be more intuitive as well so a player can't just roll Need on everything to try and ninja items by luck.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, if someone's being a huge jerk in the party, Vote Kick them. Ignore them. You won't play with them again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677231801-say-no-to-crossrealm-instancing.html))<br />
<br />
Looking for Raid System<br />
The Looking For Raid system is entirely separate from the Dungeon System and is only for your realm. Players are not automatically grouped with this tool and it can be accessed from anywhere. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677231801-say-no-to-crossrealm-instancing.html))<br />
<br />
Cross-Realms Raid<br />
It's something that has been discussed and is not out of the question, however we have no plans for allowing cross-realm raids in patch 3.3. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677231801-say-no-to-crossrealm-instancing.html))<br />
<br />
Dungeon System Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677351931-can-you-do-the-random-daily-with-a-nonpug.html))<br />
What happens when your group falls apart before the completion of the random heroic? (assume you are saved as a result now)<br />
As it works on the test realms right now, it's no different than if a group were to fall apart mid-run on the live realms today. If anyone leaves the group or gets kicked though, the leader will be asked if he or she wants to continue the instance. If the leader chooses to continue, the group will automatically be put back into the Dungeon System to find more members. <br />
<br />
Will the new members be warned, say, that they've been chosen to join a dungeon already in progress with X bosses dead and be given an option to join or wait for a fresh run?<br />
Yes. <br />
<br />
Will a dungeon leader be given the option to continue the raid without adding more members? I've been in more than one pug where a problem child QQs and leaves, and the run goes a lot faster with the 4 than it did with the full 5. <br />
Yes, the leader can choose not to have the Dungeon System fill vacancies. <br />
<br />
How exactly do you know what the random heroic is? Or you just get awarded for the first random heroic you run as if it was the daily, no matter what random instance it is?<br />
Yes, you get rewarded for completing the first Daily Random Heroic dungeon you do on any given day. It doesn't work like a quest anymore, so the choice will be random for each group formed through the selection of this option. <br />
<br />
Do you get rewards for using the tool within your realm only or must you use the battlegroup search to be rewarded?<br />
You can form a group of five players on your realm and then select the Daily Random Heroic dungeon through the Dungeon System tool. You will be rewarded just the same except for the fact that you will not get credit toward the pick-up group Achievement reward. <br />
<br />
On the ptr, there was a gold reward for doing the random the first time along with the frost emblems? Is this still the case? If so, will there be a gold reward for additional random dungeon runs after the first one completed?<br />
We're still discussing this. <br />
<br />
Can you decide if you want to look for people in your realm alone or the tool will just mix and match?<br />
If you're looking for party members via the Dungeon System, it will always look for eligible characters queued within your Battlegroup. You will need to use the Looking For Group chat channel in a major city or form a group on your own terms if you want to keep the group confined to players on your own realm. This doesn't make you ineligible for the Daily Random dungeon rewards though. <br />
<br />
How is the gear requirement determined? is Blizzard implementing their own Gearscore?<br />
The Dungeon System will make sure players are of the appropriate level, have the appropriate attunements for a dungeon (if applicable), and look at the average item level of each player. The system will put together a group according to the roles (tanking, healing, DPS) players have selected to fill and attempt to match characters as best as possible according to the items they have equipped. <br />
<br />
Is there going to be some information released about minimum gear item level requirements, and how to calculate them? I doubt it will be an issue for most characters, but from observation on the PTR it looks like brand new level 80s and some very undergeared alts are going to be unable to queue for both ToC/Icecrown normal instances and all Wrath heroic instances through the new system. More feedback than &quot;get better gear&quot; would be helpful in that case. <br />
We'll look into this. <br />
<br />
When is the particular dungeon determined and is it fixed if you degroup? Say you find yourself assigned Oculus and you have no desire to do that. If you degroup (taking the deserter debuff) and jump back into LFG 15 minutes later, are you locked into having Oculus once it has been assigned once even though you haven't completed it?<br />
The dungeon is determined once the group is filled. If the group does not like the instance that's been selected, they can leave, get the Deserter debuff, and try again to get a different random dungeon once the 15-minute debuff dissipates. <br />
<br />
Are the random dungeon emblem rewards independent based? By this I mean, say I join a group where a few members already did their first random dungeon for the day, but I have yet to do a reward. Will I still get my 2 Emblem of Frost or will I get 2 Emblem of Triumphs.<br />
As long as you select to do a random Heroic dungeon and it's your first for the day, you will be given the daily reward for completing that dungeon. <br />
<br />
Is a character still limited to doing each dungeon in heroic mode once per day? That is, if one continues to use the &quot;Random&quot; option, is it possible to get the same heroic dungeon more than once in a day? I'd assume not; that is, the list of available heroic dungeons would be reduced each time you complete one, until (if you were really keen and fast!) the list would be empty until the daily reset.<br />
If the Random option is repeatedly selected, players can run the same Heroic dungeon more than once a day. If a specific dungeon is chosen through the Dungeon System, that specific dungeon cannot be chosen more than once a day.<br />
<br />
You could technically be given, say, Heroic Culling of Stratholme repeatedly when choosing the Random option and be eligible to repeatedly run that Heroic dungeon in one day. You cannot, however, repeatedly choose Culling of Stratholme in the Dungeon System.<br />
<br />
If you run Heroic Culling of Stratholme through the Random option, you cannot select that Heroic instance specifically again in the Dungeon System. If you choose to run Heroic Culling of Stratholme rather than pick the Random option, there is a chance you will be selected to run Heroic Culling of Stratholme again if you pick the Random option later that same day. <br />
<br />
What should be the medium for deciding if someone is competent for a PuG raid anymore?<br />
Performance, Achievements, gear, etc. I don't see how the Dungeon System changes this. The LFR system will afford players who want to raid additional options for finding the best group and raid leader. Nothing is fundamentally changing with regards to expected performance in a pick-up raid. We're just giving players more tools to find a raid (realm-only) or dungeon (cross-realm) group. Each player is still accountable for his or her performance. <br />
<br />
When you say that the random group system matches item levels with other players, does this mean that it tries to group people with a similar item level, or of an average item level?<br />
It's going to try to group people with similar gear together, similar to the Arena system attempting to match teams with relatively equivalent ratings against each other. <br />
<br />
You sort of answers this before, but if I got put in a dungeon that I -really- didn't want to do as my first random heroic of the day, and I drop group, wait the 15 minutes and join a new one, do I still get the 2 Frost Emblems? Or do I -have- to take the first random heroic that is presented to me to earn my Frost? <br />
No, you will still be eligible for the daily loot even if you don't complete the first random Heroic dungeon you enter. <br />

Paladin healing<br />
We think paladins would feel fine too if they really used their full arsenal. But since cost is almost irrelevant (you can afford the mana and can't afford to not have the big heal) and since Holy Light can be hasted so much and crits all the time, everything looks like a job for Holy Light. I think Beacon and Sacred Shield have done a lot for paladins and maybe there is room for one or two more heals, but I don't think the size of the toolbox is really the problem here. Druids have a big toolbox, yet some druids can go through a whole raid with almost nothing but Rejuv and Wild Growth. If we nerfed Holy Light -- hard -- then other paladin spells would look more attractive. But that would be a big change with a lot of ramifications, and not one we're going to make for 3.3.

Dual Wield at LVL 1 in Patch 3.3<br />
This is pretty much the answer. While other classes can viably dual wield, it's a core part of the rogue class. As one aspect of the many changes we're making in patch 3.3 to improve the learning curve for brand new players, we're making it so that rogues, by default, know how to dual wield.

<br />
Cross-Realms Raid<br />
It's something that has been discussed and is not out of the question, however we have no plans for allowing cross-realm raids in patch 3.3. (Source)<br />
<br />
<br />
The main issue with pugs, and cross realm anything that gets you saved to an instance,.. <br />
Is that you, well. get saved and are unable to join a group afterwards.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see this changed into some method that allows you to join groups &quot;even if you are saved&quot;, but makes it so you're not eligible for loot or achievements from those bosses that you're already saved to.<br />
It's pissantly annoying that people either accidentally get saved, or try a fail pug and are then afterwards unable to help friends. Or some are made to join a guild run, only to leave 4-5 others out of the raid because there's simply not enough other players online.<br />
If 4 of those who are saved can at least help - for badges or simply charity, would make a lot of happy players.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Vote Kick<br />
Players who use the system to find additional random members for their party will be afforded a couple of extra conveniences to help them perform well. The loot option is fixed to the updated Need Before Greed option (and unalterable by any member) and players can vote to remove another party member from the group. It will take four votes in order to remove someone, however, so consider this newfound power carefully.<br />
<br />
Great feature to kick players who are &quot;afk 5 minutes&quot; and still not back after 20.</div></div><hr />

Right. Well actually there is because a day has only 24h...stupid rule, I know.. but this one still applies. But you can do a large amount of emblems a day by just doing 5man heroics...still you only get the T9 or lower stuff from triumph.<br />

Well in my opinion, saying that we only use HL is pretty much not true, I myself use mostly FoL, I spam HL only on AnubHC 3rd phase when I have to keep two tank alive, in every other situation I use FoL combined with HS to heal and I feel it's just fine(ofc I use SS and BoL too ;) ). I do think tht pally's need a bigger toolbox thou, we mainly need a HoT that is not SS dependant or a raid/party wide healing spell, we are really great in single target healing(and this is a bit boring, esp. when a shammy or a druid comes and laughs at our hps, cause who cares that I did more healing on 2 targets than he did on whole raid whe I have 75% overhealing :/ and who cares that he needed to regenerate mana and I didn't go below 30k all the fight :P ), but when it comes to multiple targets we really start to stay behind other healers :/</div></div><hr />

So when you've completed the daily Random quests, you get 2 BONUS triumph emblems right next to all the Triumph emblems you get <br />
from killing the bosses. So on average, you get about 6-7 badges PER heroic completed. Assuming that the T9 set ( although it's slightly <br />
old in patch 3.3 ) is fully available via Triumph badges, you can basically farm yourself a T9 set by running heroics all day.<br />
<br />
Assuming that each heroic takes around 30 min - 1 hour to complete ( on average ) you can get a SH#tload of emblems each day.<br />

I agree it should be possible to get mail, but not as &quot;need&quot;.<br />

Oculus is annoying (actually I find the dragon phase refreshing, it's not the problem for me).

Even blizzard acknowledges that oculus is the most annoying 5 man instance (on whatever scale you want to judge this, this is your preference) because they took it into their Q&amp;A.</div></div><hr />

Probably because people like playing their characters. I play a rogue because I like playing a rogue, so I'd rather not control a dragon or a tank or whatever. Also I think vehicle combat, and especially in air feels clunky and annoying to control.</div></div><hr />

Does this lessen immersion? I think it does a little, but I think it's worth it. WoW has always been fun first, story as a supporting role. I don't think this will kill it if you want to explore the world, but it makes things a little more convenient, which is nice. I'm looking forward to it.<br />
<br />
Oculus: haet oculus. &gt;:( And the dragon part sucks, mainly because its slow yet chaotic and most of the time you have one ability you spam and one you use once in a while. I like Flame Leviathan. I like riding the frost dragon in the DK intro quests. It's not that I hate vehicle combat, I just don't like the vehicle combat in Oculus, and each boss is super annoying and not fun too. I hope I can get groups to disband entirely if we get oculus as our random dungeon.<br />
<br />
Paladin healing: My main is a paladin and I have got my healing gear at least to the level of my ret gear now. I've successfully healed ToC10, Ony25&amp;10 VoA25&amp;10 etc, and even after all this time.... paladin healing is kind of boring. :( Going to raids as retribution is oh so much more fun.<br />

In my experience it's just due to the fact that it was a nightmare in pugs, but with the dragon changes a couple of decently geared players can do it quite easily, i even got &quot;Make it count&quot; on the first run with my alt, also in a pug, so it really isn't that hard, people just wrote it off several patches ago and won't accept the changes that have been made there.</div></div><hr />

Yes! It's not alone about the dragon part (again, I personally don't hate it..maybe because I always get the ruby drake) it's the whole instance that is annoying.<br />
Yet again, UP is annoying if your group doesn't know how to do Skadi right.<br />
Also Halls of Stone with 3 melee dps, one being a dk with a ghoul that runs around aimless and confuses everyone..hate. I hope the random tool will not let this happen and it's that what they mean by &quot;matchmaking&quot; (not just gearwise)</div></div><hr />

lol dude... U compare Holadin vs Retardin in boss encounters ???<br />
Ive healed every boss till now and most hard modes... If u play 30 times a boss as healer (and especially a paladin with only 1 instant heal and many life saver skill HoP,LoH etc) u play 30 different encounters coz 1/25 do something wrong or out of the ordinary your rotation (if theres any) changes as your playstyle also...<br />
<br />
Ret (and i have ret gear and done most bosses also) is just spamming 4 buttons + 2 procs...*end story*<br />

While the new system offers the ability to group with player from other realms within your Battlegroup, you won’t be able to use this to manually invite specific players to groups.<br />

<br />
You won't be forced to use anything. As long as there's enchanter in group system will enable the option and the game itself will disenchant the loot for the group. At least that's my understanding of it. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately there are no details about this feature yet but I image it would work like this (assuming there's enchanter in group so option is enabled): Item drops and group will be presented with standard loot window with 4 options: Need, Greed, Pass and Disenchant. If all group members choose disenchant or pass, game disenchants the items and dust/essences/shards will be randomly given to one of those who rolled Disenchant. So basically same as &quot;disenchanter greeds&quot; manual system you have now but without actually bothering enchanter to loot the item, disenchant it, roll between members and then trade it to them.<br />
<br />
I love the idea and I honestly don't get what exactly are you complaining about. It will only save you work and makes looting great deal faster, nothing else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ylera</div><div class="date">2009-10-29, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd guess that greed and disenchant have the same priority. The game rolls, and the person who greeded would get the item if they won the roll, or the person who selected disenchant would get the mats if they won the roll. Otherwise 4 people in the group could roll for disenchant but 1 greeds and gets the loot.<br />
<br />
With this though, a situation could arise where a Plate wearer 'needs' a mail piece, but can only greed on it, so he selects greed. The other 4 people in the group selects disenchant. One of the latter wins it, item gets immediately disenchanted (destroyed) and receives the mats. The plate wearer misses out on a piece of gear he needed.<br />
<br />
Or does this system *only* disenchant items when the whole group chooses disenchant?<br />
<br />

The new LFG looks awesome though, can't wait for 3.3.</div></div><hr />

Also the need before greed system isnt a real problem..if you miss that mail chest that would be a total upgrade for your paladin...just run 2 more dungeons and buy T9 chest..that is even better than any plate that could drop from a 5 man heroic.</div></div><hr />

No, these things obviously weren't hard. But sometimes finding a group is hard. The new LFG system makes it easy. And because it's Cross Battlegroup, obviously you can't summon people using summoning stones, or invite people who don't exist on your realm, so teleporting and automatic inviting is necessary to facilitate the system.<br />
<br />
You can still click on people and invite and fly to the instance if you wish, with people on your own realm using the LFG chat channel. Brain, profit.</div></div><hr />

I meant that main spec/off spec thing is stupid.<br />
Also Cataclysm will bring a almost complete revamp on gear and stat distribution. They will assure that no paladin want's to use leather or mail. That no druid needs to back up to cloth anymore.<br />

Great point. You should bring this to blizzard, it will enlighten them. I mean arguments like &quot;Change realm&quot; or &quot;Don't do the content&quot; seem amazing and I think it will help implement a better system. [/sarcarsm]</div></div><hr />

Need Before Greed will now recognize gear appropriate for a class in three ways: the class must be able to equip the item, pure melee will be unable to roll on spellpower items, and classes are limited to their dominant armor type (for example, plate for paladins). All items will still be available via greed rolls should no member be able to use the item as well as the new disenchant option will be available for all parties.&quot;<br />
<br />
While I agree with the intent and effort, I must disagree with the Plate wearers only get plate stuff. The advantage of wearing plate (and the associated higher repair bill) is that you can use any type of armor. Since day 1 of wow till now sometimes leather (and to a lesser extent mail) is better dps in that slot. To restrict plate wearers to only plate makes them pay the higher repair for nothing and takes away the key benefit to wearing plate, armor selection, along with sometimes higher dps items. Armor value dosen't excatly mean much vs a raid boss for a dps. <br />
<br />
Many kudos to other changes being put forth, lots of good changes.</div></div><hr />

Well hopefully they will fix future itemization so that you won't desire to use Leather/Mail.<br />

This is fine and all but I foresee a slight issue. For a beginner Tank/healers some heroics present more of a challenge than others.

<br />
Let's assume we have a group with one Plate and one Mail user.<br />
<br />
A mail peace drop, that possibly can be upgrade to the Plate player, we have these 2 possible need situations:<br />
<br />
Plate: Need<br />
Mail: Need<br />
Mail gets the item, regardless of roll (Mail priority on this class armor)<br />
<br />
Plate: Need<br />
Mail: Greed/Pass/Disenchant<br />
Plate gets the item, because CAN equip and there's no Need roll from priority (Mail)<br />
<br />
This way, you can get Offspec/lower item by rolling Need, but without the fear that someone will &quot;steal&quot; your gear.<br />
<br />
Regarding Disenchant option, it's on par with Greed, you just have to option to request the mats, instead of the item.<br />
The same have been done in current system in some PuGs:<br />
<br />
All use Need/Greed as usual and at the end if there's enchanter present, you can trade him the items you want disenchanted. There are still people that preffer to sell item to vendor, instead of the hassle of AH and this IMO is the best way to handle greed rolls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The daily reward is only based on if you COMPLETE the first one given to you.<br />
<br />
Lets say you get Oculus as your first random, just leave the group and queue again.<br />
<br />
You'll get a different heroic, and because you didnt complete the first one, you still have a shot at the daily reward with a different instance.<br />
<br />
Saving isnt an issue either as if you use the random option, you can do the same instance multiple times a day.<br />
<br />
The lock outs only prevent you from MANUALLY chosing that instance.</div></div><hr />

WHy you think its like that ? Maybe because all other spells are simply not atracctive to use ? Maybe because flash heal is not doing enough healing ? Maybe because to make it better you need to spend another GCD on sacred shield ? Maybe because to use beacon of light you need again to spend a GCD before actually healing ? OR maybe its because the instant cast has a 6 sec cooldown that needs to be kept ready for the &quot;oh shit&quot; moment.<br />
<br />
Really... Increase the Mana cost of HL by 90% and would paladins be using any of these spells that ALL require extra global CD before an acutally heal can be cast? No they would not - they would simply quit.<br />
<br />
Holy paladins need some REAL solutions - but so far Blizzard has not brought one. For me there is no question that Holy palas should get a 5man hot heal in the next expansion - to balance their overall ability. ANd then Blizzard should cut the GCDs need for the class to actually become a real healer... not global cooldown class.<br />
<br />
And to me it sounds like GC is only playing his Healer in overgeard runs anyway... and also obviously that then they do not need to assign diffrent roles to the healers - meaning that by swapping roles around - healers will actully still enjoy the farming runs quite alot. <br />
<br />
But ofc - they would probalby enjoy them more if downranking was still in the game - and they could adjust the actual healing needed. Cause atm - thats not poosible. There is just OOM and dead group version - balanced dead boss version (mainly based on gear) and then dead boss with endless overheals (in the typicla GC overgeard runs)</div></div><hr />

You can do UNLIMITED RANDOM Heroics. You can potentially get Heroic CoS 6 times in a row.<br />

You will only get the triumph for the first daily normal dungeon you do that day. so if it takes you 35 days to get to 80 from 70 then sure you could have your first piece. I think you confused the random Heroic Daily and then Random Heroic which gives 2 badges per run.<br />

<br />
1) Dungeon system is good, but further erodes the point of realms. 'Back in the day' you chose a server and that is who you played with. Yes it had fewer people, but you knew who you were fighting with or fighting against. When you team within the battlegroup, wether for a BG or a Dungeon, you are basically anonymous. Everyone knows what anonymity does, so don't be suprised to encounter more jerks.<br />
<br />
I worry however if the realm system is being eroded too much. I hated cross-realm BG's, I used to love meeting people in the warcraft world who I had fought against in warsong gulch. Now adays, most people don't bond any kind of social relationships and that problem is only going to get worse. Part of the fun of the game is the community, knowing who you are partying with. I think it will be a different game coming. Much more like Team Fortress Classic or Warcraft 3(online) when you always just play with random people and never care who they are.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) For Ghostcrawler to say &quot;We have a vision for Paladins&quot; and kind of flippantly revoke accusations that the Paladin class is changing too fast is simply absurd. I quit my Holy Paladin during the Sunwell patch and switched to a Holy Priest and I am far happier. Sure we get the occasional update but the core mechanics and playstyle of priest has never changed. Unlike Paladins however who have been through so many changes you have to relearn the whole class every patch. This is what made me quit my paladin.<br />
<br />
So I am sorry Ghostcrawler, I usually always agree with you and think you are a wise dev but on this issue you are incorrect or misguided or both. You put the Paladin class through so much turmoil. You chop and change. You suddenly decide long standing abilities should be removed or moved. Look at what you did with consecration? That has been everywhere you could put it! Blessing of Kings? What about the nerfs to illumination, a CORE Holy Paladin mechanic at one point. <br />
<br />
To me all this proves is that Blizzard simply cannot balance the Paladin class. The only other class which can dps, tank AND heal is the druid and they are much more restricted by forms and mana. It is obvious once you analyse it all Blizzard is going to end up doing is sticking anything useful (talent wise) in the bottom half to talent trees to avoid &quot;unintentional use&quot; such as Tank Healing, or Ret Healing, etc. I gaveup playing my Paladin, its like one horrible rollercoster and you have no control over it. I healed as a Paladin from the days of Molten Core and I wouldn't touch the class with a barge poll. For others you are welcome to try, especially when Paladins are OP (which no doubt they always will go through cycles of this) but just remember, you will be chopped, changed, nerfed, reverted, removed etc etc. <br />
<br />
Me? I will stick to priest. It has the decency to not completely overhaul the class every other patch. I always feel so glad I'm no longer a Holy Paladin.</div></div><hr />

Sadly - no. But as far as there are no &quot;Daily&quot; as it's now, it's not that much of a problem. The reward is to complete 1 Heroic and 1 Normal, not 2 Heroics as it is now.<br />
<br />
<br />
did u still get the rep rewards for the random normal dungeon?<br />
Rep items that you get now from Normal Daily will be available for purchase with emblems (don't remember which ones, but I suppose it was Triumph)</div></div><hr />

It's just the same as getting 2 of Triumph every day from the daily heroic now, did you think Blizz are gonna change their design philosophies because a bunch of elitists QQ about not being able to splurge their epeen over everyone else?</div></div><hr />

The right way to think about is:<br />
<br />
There are only 2 kind of emblems:<br />
1. Raid emblems (obtained from top tier raid)<br />
2. Heroic emblems (obtained from heroics/lower tier raids)<br />
<br />
When new raid tier is added, Heroic emblem is equal to previous Raid emblem and Raid emblem something new.<br />
<br />
So in this terms we have:<br />
<br />
New System = Current System = What you get<br />
First Random Heroic Dungeon = Daily Heroic Dungeon = 2x Raid Emblem<br />
Next Random Heroic/Heroic drops = Heroic drops = Heroic Emblem<br />
First Random Normal = Daily Normal Dungeon = equivalent of rep item or 1 Heroic emblem<br />
<br />
So the new system do not change anything about from where you obtain emblems, just sligtly modifies the speed (multiple random heroic)</div></div><hr />

The grouping system seems so flawed anyway, there will be a mass of retards and you get paired randomly and need 4 votes to replace someone 30 + min heroics inc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. You have to have enchanter in group. If you don't the option to disenchant is not available to your group. <br />
<br />
So it's the same as now (all pass, enchanter greeds, disenchants and then trades mats to whoever won the roll) but without the hassle for enchanters.<br />
<br />
You won't get enchanting mats from dungeon if you have group full of leatherworkers and tailors.</div></div><hr />

I hear about Tanks doing 1 quick ability than going AFK and holding aggro and surviving. DPS obviously has an easy job, spam the same spells with no real consequences for being lazy or messing up the rotation. Healers always have a different rotation and have to adjust more than anyone when something happens. Paladins have to time their spells correctly, and Priests have 15 different heal spells to choose from (7 primary ones), and druids... well nothing hard about them just spam HoTs with your eyes closed.<br />
<br />
The only thing wrong with the game right now is the WoW community. Face it, you're always going to be in an environment that all depends on your reputation, your skill will never matter, they're never going to implement IQ tests, there will always be not enough guilds on a server to let everyone raid, every guild will be packed with people having to sit out or get declined regardless of skill. There will always be ninjas taking things from raids and laughing at the spammers calling them out to make them look like the bad guys. There will always be the cheap little kids that only play the character that's overpowered the most, rather than what they like or enjoy. European Horde guilds are going to continue rule the bar on raid progression, gathering all the fame while the only thing that differences guild progression is how creative their loot system is, and who lags less, or who's server comes back up first after maintenance. Top server guilds will always be recruiting only 1 person every 5 months, no guilds will ever let go of the people they have now, nobody will ever be brave enough to step up and take the role of either tanking, being a guild leader, party leader, raid leader, talking publicly, or doing anything important, and nobody will ever be brave enough to follow them if they do.<br />
<br />
Face it, the WoW community sucks and that's what they have to fix.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spoken like someone who's done nothing but heal in wow. A majority of work for a tank comes in preparation for the raid, not during it. Knowing what gear to use and having all those options available for different encounters as well as knowing the intricacies of each encounter that most people overlook is what differentiates good tanks from bad ones. And don't even try to say that you can just afk and build threat on a boss, you've obviously never tanked a boss, let alone in a mobility fight where moving it correctly is everything. DPS also have to stay alive while maximizing their dps, if you've never done it you obviously don't know how difficult that can be on some fights, especially for certain dps classes/specs. Get off your high horse and realize that it takes a raid to down a boss, not just the healers, this game isn't that hard and trying to claim that one role in a raid is so much superior than another is asinine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally agree, this new system should only be able to be activated by the group disenchanter, if there is one. Basically, if you aren't the group leader but you are the only disenchanter, if the group leader tries to activate it, you should get a pop-up asking whether you want to disenchant the drops automatically. Otherwise this is just unfair for enchanters.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FireryRage</div><div class="date">2009-10-29, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of my mains is an ench, and while I'm not ecstatic about the change, I can see the reasoning.<br />
Enchs still have the advantage, because there's always an ench in their groups, which means they always have 1/5 odds to get the mats.<br />
Take, on the other hand, a non-ench toon. Assuming they only get an ench in their group half of the time, suddenly, that means they have a mean 1/10 odd of getting mats from an item. This means ench still get the advantage in the long run, just not quite on the same scale as before.<br />
<br />
However, this change is offset by other changes in the patch. Consider the new random group system. With this, you get quick groups, direct teleports and (virtually) countless possible runs. This means drops from dungeons will come faster than before, and as such, ench (who run dungeons to a greater extent due to patche changes) will still get a significant amount more mats.<br />
<br />
Still, over all, an interesting change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then just keep greeding all the gear you see in heroics then... the new disenchant thing is equivalent to a greed roll its just that instead of the item itself the person would instead recieve the enchanting mats... so it even benefits the enchanter... so basically now everyone will be greeding the gear same as they always have except those that want enchanting mats will get them and those that want to sell the item instead can get the item... its actually making it so you don't HAVE to pass out mats at the end if you didn't want to... everyone just competes over the indivdual items each time they drop like they would if they didn't know you were an enchanter...</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Dungeon system is good, but further erodes the point of realms. 'Back in the day' you chose a server and that is who you played with. Yes it had fewer people, but you knew who you were fighting with or fighting against. When you team within the battlegroup, wether for a BG or a Dungeon, you are basically anonymous. Everyone knows what anonymity does, so don't be suprised to encounter more jerks.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I also quit in Sunwell because of the same reasons.<br />
<br />
I had desided weeks before that the day that a healing paladin was no longer able to maintain resonable healing values up - compared to the 3 other healing classes that all had AOE heals - I would quit. First day of Sunwell showed me that BLizzard was creating a game where one healing class was far inferior to others for doing one job. And it has not changed. And to this day - BLizzard is trying to acutually claim they have a vision for paladins. Their only vision is to be &quot;diffrent&quot;. If that means that they get nothing but GCD buffs to increase their healing - and still smash HL - then they really are doing a smashing job.<br />
<br />
No... I will never come close to WOW again. Going Priest was a smart move for you - cause at least Blizzard has few ppl actually playing priests and have strong vision that fits to the vision of the players. The vision of BLizzard when it comes to Palas is just beeing &quot;diffrent&quot;. Thats it -and thats not what Paladins are looking for. They are looking for actual balanced class that has longterm goal when it comes to development. The glyph of holy light is probably the best proof that Blizzard can't see futher than their nose when it comes to holy palas. And they simply do not care aparently.<br />
<br />
Unless the long term vision of BLizzard is to have glyph of holy ligth beeing used for the next 5 years ? Or maybe create a new one that gives 20% heal...<br />
<br />
Yes - these are the geniuses behind the paladin class.</div></div><hr />

This is fine and all but I foresee a slight issue. For a beginner Tank/healers some heroics present more of a challenge than others.

Absolutely. I remember DPS kitty and our new DK was tanking HAN and we wiped a few times (he was learning to tank), no big deal. Two of the others asked if I could tank it, I said if everyone agreed, but I was supporting my guildmate learning to tank.<br />
<br />
We get to last boss and... yeah, POUND was 1 shotting him. Buffed he was at 26K health or so... I had more hit points unbuffed in kitty form. I happily stepped in on the next attempt to close it out.</div></div><hr />

Just buffing healing overall, or taking some of the challenge away from the healers, I don't think makes the game more fun for them.

<br />
Got to agree with this. What I hate about healing in other games is that it's too simple and is meant for people who don't know how to play well, but still want to play.<br />
<br />
Take the medic class in Team Fortress 2 for example. You literally just point your healomatic in the general direction of someone and it heals. No aiming required. And then you just follow around someone else that gets to have fun. Yay! And worse it's a necessary class so SOMEONE has to do it. Medic in TF2 is the class for your GF when you go to a cybercafe but she sucks so you tell her to just press mouse1 and follow you around. In some other MMO there is like only 1 healing spell and you just target someone and spam it.<br />

It's true in milk runs, it can be boring because nothing is happening much. That's when you run over to the second pack of mobs and &quot;accidently&quot; pull more.</div></div><hr />
