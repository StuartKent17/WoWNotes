The End of Days approaches…. Diablo III will be unleashed from the Burning Hells on May 15, 2012, and you can be ready to play the minute the servers go live by pre-purchasing the game digitally on Battle.net (https://us.battle.net/account/activation/landing.html?product=D3) today.<br />
<br />
Beginning May 15, players around the world will be able to return to Tristram to discover the dark secrets of a fallen star and begin their quest to save Sanctuary from the impending demonic invasion. To secure your place as a barbarian, monk, demon hunter, witch doctor, or wizard right now, simply log in to your Battle.net account, and then purchase and download* Diablo III, and you’ll be ready to play when the game launches.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft players interested in getting Diablo III for free can still get in on the World of Warcraft Annual Pass, but the promotion will be ending at 12:01 a.m. PDT on May 1, 2012. When you sign up for the Annual Pass and make a 1-year commitment to World of Warcraft, you’ll receive a free digital copy of Diablo III, an exclusive World of Warcraft in-game mount (Tyrael’s Charger), as well as access to the upcoming World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria beta test. Learn more at the Annual Pass signup page (http://us.media.blizzard.com/wow/promotion/wap/en-us.html).<br />
<br />
For more details on the May 15 release of Diablo III, be sure to hit the official press release (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/press/pressreleases.html), or head to our new Diablo III game page (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/d3/) to learn more about the game and pre-purchase your digital copy.<br />

<br />
1:17AM PDT Diablo III will be free to World of Warcraft subscribers! WoW Annual Pass: starting today, you can buy a 12 month subscription that can be billed monthly. By making that commitment to subscribe for 12 months, you get D3 free at launch. You will also get access to the next expansion beta for WoW as a tester. Finally, you get the exclusive new in-game mount, Tyrael's Charger. Looks like Invincible model only golden hued with Tyreal-esque light. Pass is available now.</div></div><hr />

Nope. Its always been the MoP beta and that is all. You are mistaken. (Well, they specifically say the NEXT WoW Expansion which ended up being MoP)<br />
<br />
Google &quot;Blizzard Annual Pass Announcement&quot; and you can see not only Blizzard's original announcement, but also all the major gaming sites' coverage of said announcement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Technically The MoP-Beta IS one of the upcoming beta tests so no loophole there. <br />
<br />
But I don't care about other people interpreting this topic. To me it has always been clear that the Beta-Access is for MoP since that's what they told us at the Blizzcon opening when the annual pass was announced.</div></div><hr />

I signed up mins. after it was announced and one of the big reasons I did so was because it said MoP Beta access.. so...</div></div><hr />

I know all about the Warez scene. It will take significant resources to crack it and I doubt the digital download will be out long enough for them to manage cracking it before the release date.</div></div><hr />

But I don't care about other people interpreting this topic. To me it has always been clear that the Beta-Access is for MoP since that's what they told us at the Blizzcon opening when the annual pass was announced.<br />

apparently you can preload with the annual pass right now, and can freely choose which client you want, and download multiple times, EU, US, Russian..so.. I bet my money that you get a worldwide multiplayer without region locks<br />

Considering that all the quest data, skill damage data, NPC, monster and loot generation, and AI is all handled on Blizzards servers, it would be impossible for anyone to accurately reproduce the game without access to those servers. Granted, they could make a sandbox server before the actual servers go live, but there would be literally nothing there. And I suppose once the servers go live someone will set up private servers like they did in WoW. But they will have the same quality of gameplay most private servers do.</div></div><hr />

Now all we need is a release date for Guild Wars 2, and we can count on MoP to be released a few weeks after. And it's not like they were waiting to complete Diablo and be happy with the final final version. No, the game launches without the PvP system altogether (and god knows what else).

On a scale of 1-10, how mad would my fiancee be if I cancel our honeymoon as it starts on the day of release? -_-<br />

<br />
Also we can likely say that *When you pre-purchase Diablo III, you will be able to download an encrypted version of the game that will be unlocked upon release on May 15.means DIII will be out much sooner through warez sites.<br />
<br />
Oct/Nov would be community-crushing for WoW, cause Blizz will have just done the 1yr between DS and MoP, with NO filler raid. It will be here by Aug, MAYBE Sept.<br />
<br />
As to the warez... yeah, cool... so who has copies of Battle.net servers to run the game client on, to actually generate your game world, and save your characters on, since nothing is run client-side? Diablo 3 = Diablo 2 Closed Battle.Net. Nothing of your characters is stored locally, nor are the game worlds run on your system.</div></div><hr />

I Hope the game is brilliant, but even if the game is not as good as its hype, it will bring so many good memories of playing Diablo in my youth that will be worth it on the spot just for the fondness effect.</div></div><hr />

Amazon.com showed the standard edition as $59.99, so unless they offer a discount on battle.net, probably around the same price. (Which, incidentally, is exactly what I've been saying it would be all along.)<br />
<br />
Of course, if you went for the Annual Pass, it's $180. Hope you didn't need that extra $120, suckers.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I did the annual pass so I could get it for FREE. I paid for a year of Wow because I would have paid for a year of Wow anyway....<br />

If I hadn't done the Annual Pass, I would have paid $240 instead of $180.<br />

Gameplay in D3 is about as strategic as you can get, especially on high levels of difficulty. Managing monsters pack through CC, kiting, positioning and of course damage is the central thing in the whole game. :)</div></div><hr />

Can't kill a huge MMO with diablo. Plus, there are people out there who aren't even interested in diablo. Safe to say that if you didn't buy the annual pass chances are you won't buy D3 either. Lol @ bitter people pretending to have not heard of Tera online.</div></div><hr />

Tera is a Korean MMO that is being ported to US/Canada MMO standards and doesn't really add anything new or exciting to the genre. Instead of locking on a target and then using abilities, you have to aim them with your mouse. It has 8 classes, 4 of which are a variant of 'warrior,' while the other 4 are 'hunter,' 'mage,' 'priest,' and 'druid/shaman.' <br />
<br />
The leveling system is a grindfest where you go and pickup meaningless quests and perform meaningless actions for gold and other items. Try as hard as I could, I just couldn't relate or enjoy anything that I encountered while questing. The graphic quality is high res and it works well enough, but the art style is generally trash. There are no race/class restrictions and half the races are 'omgwtf' designed. <br />
<br />
You learn new ranks of abilities, which you have to purchase at a trainer as you level (why do new MMOs insist on forcing players to do this?) Everyone starts out in the same zone (GL completing quests) and follows the same progression path, regardless of race or class. <br />
<br />
All in all, the game isn't unique or compelling, and several servers in Korea have already been shut down, due to an overall lack of game popularity. I have a couple buddies who really want me to come play it when it releases, but I'm definitely not going to play it. It's worse that SWTOR, and that's hard to do.<br />
<br />
Here's a good video to explain the 'WTF' of Tera:<br />

I had honestly never heard of Tera until I watched a totalbuscuit video about a week ago, and I didn't like the look of it and it's not because &quot;OMGZ u A WOW FANBOI!!!111!!! U LEIK PANDAS (Even though Tera has this ridiculously cute animal race in it, I mean really there the one thing I did like) U SUCK FOR SIGNING UP TO THE ANNUEL PASZ U REGRET IT LAWL.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Happens to be the one thing I liked, and the textures, so good. :) Yeah, not a fan of the Korean/Chinese MMO's but damn do they look nice. This is why I'm so excited for MOP, combining the stuff I like in Western Mmo's with eastern MMo's :)<br />
<br />
Also, IDK, should I start the download now? It'll probably just sit there on my laptop bugging the HELL out of me. I CAN'T PLAY YOU!!!</div></div><hr />

I have never heard of Tera before. Looking it up it seems like just another small time asian mmo. Numbers are hard to find, but it reduced it's servers from 35 to 15 halfway last year. Assuming a top of 5k players per server we're looking at 75k subscriptions tops.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit puzzled why you think people should have heard from such a low profile small time mmo.</div></div><hr />

You can get a discount on the CE I think, since you bought the annual pass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't even know how to respond to this. Obviously people would prefer to get the game in their hands sooner rather than later. You know MoP is coming out someday. What's the difference between playing it in 2012 rather than 2015? Just because it will eventually come out doesn't mean we shouldn't be excited that it finally is, especially since it has been a game people have been dying to see for 12 years already.<br />
<br />
Also, if it comes out in March it means you can play during the summer months. Obviously you could not in December.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nhim</div><div class="date">2012-03-15, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really really really want to like this game. But as someone who hasn't played anything diablo before, just looking at D3 videos on youtube, it looks pretty boring? Like the graphics are awful, the gameplay doesn't seem that strategic, and there are like 4 classes. I guess I'll wait to see the review on release, but I'm trying really hard to like this and it isn't happening. Can't understand the hype I guess.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a big Diablo original and Diablo 2 fan I was really excited about D3. I lurked around all the fan sites and patiently awaited the beta invite. I finally got my invite. This is when the huge disappointment came. I realized that I had some strong nostalgic feelings about the game that was driving my interest. The developers are a stuck in the mid 90s. No camera control and only click to move is a huge deal breaker in 2012 IMO. I really wanted to play but just can't.</div></div><hr />

(Which, incidentally, is exactly what I've been saying it would be all along.)<br />
<br />
Of course, if you went for the Annual Pass, it's $180. Hope you didn't need that extra $120, suckers.<br />
<br />
This is such a stupid argument to try an make. I wasn't signing up for the annual pass just to get Diablo 3 that would just be flat out dumb. I signed up because I knew I would be paying for WoW for another year anyways. I have never had a lapse in my WoW account so the offer just made a lot of sense.</div></div><hr />
