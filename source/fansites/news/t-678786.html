Content Update 3.3: Quest Tracking Preview<br />
We're making several improvements to the user interface for tracking quest objectives in our 3.3 content update. These new features will serve to improve the questing experience for players through a multitude of new tracking options.<br />
<br />
Quest Log<br />
We've added a new &quot;Show Map&quot; button on the Quest Log. The &quot;Show Map&quot; feature highlights any quest in the log and will pull up the map for the zone in which the corresponding quest objectives are located.<br />
<br />
Map<br />
When viewing the large zone map ('M' key), players will notice that all quests they have for that zone will be automatically tracked. In addition, this large map is now separated into four separate interface panes.<br />
<br />
To the right of the map, all active quests for that zone will be listed by name and be represented with a number. These numbers will be placed on the map highlighting areas of interest for each quest.<br />
<br />
A third panel below the zone map will give players the full quest text for any highlighted quest, while the fourth pane will display the quest reward. The quest map tracking feature is enabled by default. Players can disable this feature and restore the map to its original state by un-checking the &quot;Show Quest Objectives&quot; box in the lower right corner.<br />
<br />
Areas of Interest<br />
All areas of interest in a zone will be represented with a number corresponding to the number assigned to each active quest in that particular zone. When highlighting a specific quest, the corresponding number on the zone map will be highlighted as well.<br />
<br />
If the area of interest is large, for example, and a player needs to kill a number of quest creatures or collect quest items found within a large area on the map, the entire questing area of interest around the number on the map will be shaded blue.<br />
<br />
If quest objectives can be accomplished in multiple areas of the zone; for example, certain creatures need to be killed for a quest and have several different locations, the map will automatically display the nearest area of interest in proximity to the player.<br />
<br />
Shrunken Map and Objectives Tracking<br />
When viewing the large zone map ('M' key), players can click the arrow in the top right corner to bring the zone map out of full-screen mode.<br />
<br />
The map will show all areas of interest for the zone; however the other three interface panes will be removed so players can still view their character, spells, and abilities with the map open. The standard quest objectives window has been improved and will now show numbers next to each quest displayed, or a gold question mark if the quest has been completed.<br />
<br />
The objectives window is now docked below the mini-map, next to the right two action bars and can display up to ten active quests in the zone. Players can toggle between minimizing and maximizing this quest objectives window at any time by clicking on the red arrow in the top right corner of the objectives frame.<br />
<br />
Quest Difficulty Tracking<br />
This feature is turned off by default and players can choose &quot;Color Quest Difficulty&quot; under Objectives in the Interface Options menu to enable it. Enabling this option will color-code all quest names in the new map interface according to the player's level (grey, green, yellow, orange, and red).<br />
<br />
This new feature has been built to work with nearly every quest in World of Warcraft with only a few exceptions. For example, if a quest requires that a player turns in some sort of cloth or other trade goods that can be purchased from other players, the map will not display an area of interest for where these items can be found.<br />
<br />
All other quests, whether they require players to slay groups of creatures, gather some type of quest object, or hunt down a single specific target, will be tracked on the map, provided that the player is viewing the map of the zone in which these objectives can be completed. <br />
<br />

Quel'delar rewards not for every class/spec<br />
The main focus for the Quel'Delar was for it to fit for dps specs. Yes, this excludes tanks but if we added it for tanks then it would probably lead to tailoring for other specs like boomkin (sorry, just an example, not meaning to pick on you) and leads to bloating the rewards more and more than they already are.<br />
<br />
Based on my experiences too, a weapon for a warrior or paladin tank isn't quite as much of a lifeblood as it is for dps classes. Try swapping weapons around randomly some time and you will find that almost nobody will notice as long as you stay defense capped and put out good threat.<br />
<br />
Of note: Internally we have made a change that removes the mp5 from the main hand mace and changed that to haste to match the sword to make it more dps-worthy. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21043887167-tanks--every-spec-of-every-class.html))<br />

Satchet of Helpful Goods reward from low level random dungeons<br />
It appears the contents are different depending on the level of the character. From what I can see, it looks like one Rare quality item, possibly with random stats. Seems to be one of every type of wearable item, except weapons and trinkets. There's a chance I'm reading the data wrong, but that's how it appears to me.

I think it's kind of sad that so many people have just put their faith in addons to basically do all of the reading and exploring for them. That used to be part of the fun of the game but now leveling is just a speedbump on the way to 80.</div></div><hr />

I started the game around 2.1 or so, and thus missed a lot of the vanilla crap that people idolized. But the one event I was there to witness at ground zero was when they *gasp* added quest-givers' &quot;!&quot; and &quot;?&quot; to the mini-map. Upon reading pages and pages of complaints about how WoW was getting &quot;dumbed down&quot; and how the designers were killing exploration for putting the location of quest givers on the map, that was when I realized most people on the forums were useless pieces of human waste. <br />
<br />
Nothing is getting &quot;dumbed down&quot; here. There is nothing at all intelligent, elegant, or useful about reading quest text for the sixth time as you level alts. If someone does not have an innate sense of exploration, then vague directions are NOT going to magically make them enjoy the 15 minutes they wasted running around killing the wrong mobs in the wrong area. People who like exploring will still explore. Complaining about a ubiquitous mod like QuestHelper being integrated (much like it is in nearly every other MMO on the market) into WoW is like complaining about Omen functionality being made baseline. This is besides the fact that a lot of the older quest descriptions are (un)intentionally confusing, in that they refer to named places that do not actually appear on the map.</div></div><hr />

Tbc was harder than vanilla, and wotlk is harder than tbc. No, i'm not saying that i think karazhan was harder than the original naxxramas, and i'm not saying that the new naxx is harder than sunwell back in the days. <br />
<br />
There's a new way to challange yourself and your guildmates in this game, it's called hardmodes. If you honestly think that most vanilla fights were harder than for example firefighter, you're just plain wrong. WoW might have felt harder back in the days because tons of people were still new to the game and did'nt know what the fuck to do (MINUS 50DKP LOL). That's all theres to it. <br />
In another post of yours you say that farming for hours just to get one flask was cool. Allright, i can't tell you what to think or feel, but i sure as hell can't see how that's a cool thing. I don't know why you're still around on this site, since all you ever do is complain about how bad WoW is. It's allright, you don't like the game no more. Fine. Have fun playing something else, because after all it's just a game, remember?<br />

QFT, Blizzard don't want people to feel like they need addons to play, and questhelper is almost a must if you want to level fast.<br />

Thats exactly what I say in every &quot;Vanilla was hard&quot; topics. The only reason why it was hard was because people didn't have the same info they do now, and most people were new to the game.</div></div><hr />

Now to things that has gotten harder.<br />
1. Getting gear: In vanilla you couldnt even get close to raid gear from 5 mans so it was extremly hard to gear up so you could join a guild which runs MC+. I mean have you guys even tried completing the dungeon set 0,5 questline?<br />
2. Raid size: You needed to have 40 man online to go on most of the raids. This is another part of the vanilla difficulty<br />
3. Preparations for raids: In vanilla you were forced to farm endless amounts of pots before raids like AQ40 and Naxx40. <br />
<br />
The game is alot better now though. But dont say things were easy in vanilla. Farming mongoose/nr/manapots 30 hours a week was NOT easy for me atleast.</div></div><hr />

No, i'm not saying that i think karazhan was harder than the original naxxramas, and i'm not saying that the new naxx is harder than sunwell back in the days. <br />
<br />
There's a new way to challange yourself and your guildmates in this game, it's called hardmodes. If you honestly think that most vanilla fights were harder than for example firefighter, you're just plain wrong. WoW might have felt harder back in the days because tons of people were still new to the game and did'nt know what the fuck to do (MINUS 50DKP LOL). That's all theres to it. <br />
In another post of yours you say that farming for hours just to get one flask was cool. Allright, i can't tell you what to think or feel, but i sure as hell can't see how that's a cool thing. I don't know why you're still around on this site, since all you ever do is complain about how bad WoW is. It's allright, you don't like the game no more. Fine. Have fun playing something else, because after all it's just a game, remember?<br />
<br />
Sorry for going offtopic with this post, if i post again i'll try to add something OT :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I had a world kill on firefighter before it was nerfed once. I am one of extremely few people who can claim to have done this.<br />
<br />
Today's firefighter is much easier than most fights in Vanilla past MC and alot easier than most pre nerfed fights in TBC.<br />
<br />
Karazhan was exceptionally hard when it was released, Nightbane, Shade of Aran, NetherSpite and Prince were WAY harder than what firefighter is now.<br />
<br />
Original pre nerfed firefighter i would agree as one of the most difficult fights ever made though.<br />
<br />
I really doubt you ever saw that though, since all people who say Karazhan was easy i shamefully put into my noob category since this is an obvious sign that they never raided pre nerfed Karazhan.<br />
<br />
Sorry for doing that, but ye, Karazhan prenerfed was very hard to fully clear, and if you didnt know this, then you never tried it, which makes you categorically noob ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You have some weird faulty memory. Karazhan was laughable when it was released. We had the server first clear on Akama and it took us two hours and we only wiped once, when the wrong tank stood in the beam and messed up the rotation and both tanks had the debuff the next phase. Nightbane was difficult, but only because he had massive amounts of health for the time and it took all day to kill him, and Netherspite was hard to teach retarded people which beam to stand in and when. There was absolutely nothing difficult about Prince, though there were quite a few RNG wipes due to bad infernal drops and being caught in a corner. I don't really count the RNG working against you to be a degree of difficulty. It's just bad luck every so often.<br />
<br />
The only thing that made MC and Blackwind Lair hard was the decursing after Blizzard started designing raids around the original Decursive before they banned the mod and any others that would do the same thing.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that the only difficult thing about raiding pre WotLK was gearing up for the raids. Running UBRS for weeks at a time to get all your tanks the quested FR breastplate to run Ony and MC, running Ony and MC for months at a time to get your tier pieces(two drops per boss with 40 man raids was lol) and Onyxia scale cloaks for BWL.<br />
<br />
Same thing with TBC. Karazhan(and later ZA) and heroics for a month to get everyone the gear to do SSC/TK, SSC/TK for months to get everyone the gear to do BT, BT for months to get everyone the gear to do SWP.<br />
<br />
The only thing that is any easier in WotLK is the gearing process. It's a matter of opinion, but I much prefer the ease of gearing for raids in WotLK to the previous model. The fun is in the raiding, not the process to be ready to raid. And God forbid you leveled slow or pick up the game/expansion late. Good luck playing catch up under the previous system.<br />
<br />
I think everyone who has raided since original WoW can agree Naxx 40 was a pain in the dick, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
RIGHT....<br />
I kinda get the feeling that you are well settled in the cathegory of people that never tried anything but claim that they did, like pre nerf Firefighter or pre nerf Kharazan. Karazhan was cleared 10 days after TBC hit the shelves, taking in to account the attunments needed to enter it, i'd say thats pretty fast. Wan't to compare that to the hard modes in WOTLK? Wotlk IS harder then TBC and Classic.<br />
<br />
The difference is that the players and techniques have evolved. Check Rawr or DPS Spreedsheats or the addons these days.<br />
The other issue is that in Classic and Vanilla there was artificial difficulty to most of the encounters that were deemed hardest so players resorted to using clever game mechanics *cough* exploits in killing the bosses.<br />
Check 4HM, Cthun, Few of the Bosses in the Eye or SSC and lets not forget SWP. (Get attuned by mindlesly running heroics or Get 6 tanks with the tier 3 set bonus so that tount wouldnt resist, or stack 6 shamans cause of the insane aoe healing needed). Only polished instance in TBC was BT.<br />
<br />
So if you claim that TBC was harder then WOTLK, then you never tried it, which makes you categorically noob ;)<br />
See what i did there?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Always someone will disagree and say &quot;but Karazhan was easy&quot;.<br />
It only proves you didnt try it prenerfed.<br />
<br />
Karazhan was incredibly hard when it got released.<br />
<br />
Karazhan released January 16th, 2007<br />
<br />
First clear January 28th, 2007 - Death and Taxes<br />
Ensidia cleared it - Sk Gaming January 31st, 2007 / Nihilium February 6th, 2007<br />
<br />
100th guild to clear it February 21st 2007 FIVE weeks after it was launched.<br />
<br />
<br />
My guild at the time was in the first 400 World kills and it took us 8 weeks of solid raiding to clear.<br />
<br />
Karazhan was easy when it was released, prenerfed you say?<br />
<br />
May i remind you that full clears of todays instances are cleared in 1-5 days by around 500 guilds, whereas Karazhan took until 1st April for the 500th guild to fully clear, thats almost 12 weeks after raid launch.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid it's your memory that has gone wrong, not mine ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.realmhistory.net/guild-ranking/karazhan.html<br />
<br />
It was cleared 12 days by one guild. It took 12 weeks for the top 500th guild to clear.<br />
<br />
WotLK raids are cleared in 1-5 days by 500 guilds in normal modes.<br />
Karazhan prenerfed is directly comparable to some of the hardest hard modes in WotLK.<br />
<br />
Facts are facts, which infortunately, in this case, show you to be wrong ;)<br />
<br />
btw - i used to play with a player who had world clear in death and taxes (who was in the actual raid when they got World First), he joined one of the guilds i used to play in. I also used to raid with a guy that had World first on Prince, aswell as having top 10 world kills myself.<br />
<br />
You are talking to a pure old skool player with me that has pretty much seen all there is to see and witnessed such marvellous people in this game that if i were to tell you some things i have seen and been involved with in this game, you would not believe them to be possible ;)<br />

You suffer from selective reading, like i said, artificial difficuly. In wotlk the difficuly is in the execution and finding the right strategy for a boss kill. Where are the attunments and the crappy gearing up process included here?<br />
In wotlk attunments are non existant, gearing up is a breeze, lots of people have equally geared alts so theres flexibility with group setup.<br />
I didn't see you mentioning yog + 0 anywhere as well?<br />
<br />

Also people arguing about how fast Karazhan was cleared... I wonder how many really played then and remember than TBC pre-3.1 raiding was bugged beta. TBC was rushed, epic items were worse than 5-man blues, many bosses were bugged and unkillable, loads of bosses were overtuned and so on. So please cut the crap because you cannot compare both.</div></div><hr />

edit - I cleared Yog + 0 prenerfed too (well not first version prenerfed, only Stars did that i believe). World 30thish or something, can't say i cared much, once you realised rogue fok spam and hunter marking mod was available the fight was trivial.<br />
<br />
About that time was the time i started to not care about WoW and realised the obviousness of the truth - The Game had turned to crap and World firsts simply didnt mean what they used to, along with a new breed of community cry babies that have developed HEAVILY that cry when they can't kill a boss and expect everything to be handed to them or bought for irl money.<br />
<br />
In fact i laughed hard when i saw that you could buy pets from the pet shop, i KNOW the next step will be a gear shop you can buy gear from.<br />
<br />

I missed your time scale comparison on yog+0 and the &quot;difficult&quot; Karazhan.<br />
<br />
I was a raid leader and a warrior class officer all trough vanilla and some of TBC(which was a dissaster of expansion and made me play a bit more cassually). You can armory Daneel on laughing skull EU to check. Right now a play a rogue casually in a guild made up of mostly RL friends.<br />
That doesn't change the fact that you are delussional and fueled by nostalgia and probably dissapointed that you don't stand out in a crowd with your shiney epics any more, oh yes, everyone can have them now. Should i be pissed that my guild worked hard to get Thunderufury for me and now people can solo it? No, because its in the past and this game is getting better.<br />
Seems to me that you are a cry baby raider, not the rest. <br />
<br />
<br />

You are just spewing nonsense now. That was answered in the Q and A. They'll NEVER offer payed services that will have impact on the actual gameplay.<br />
When your so called facts failed, you changed subject and you didn't address any of my points about the artificial difficulty of TBC and Classic encounters. We were discussing WOTLK difficuly if you recall.</div></div><hr />

Half the troll posts on these forums are from World Top players (probably almost all of them tbh) who post on alt accounts LOL.<br />

Oh yea, i have a &quot;main&quot; MMO account which is hero member and my &quot;main&quot; posts get respected and people agreeing with me.<br />
<br />
I dont know if youve noticed that in the last few days the number of troll posts have dropped, its because when MMO ban people they ban by IP, which forces people to post through proxy browsers. MMO have got a new system in place that doesnt allow you to post through proxy anymore too.<br />

You might think you have exclusive knowledge of something when you actually don't. That is probably your case.<br />
Stars on your avatar don't make you sound intelligent, what you say does. My response to you would've stayed the same nontheless.<br />
<br />
Once again, seeking attention in this manner, pretending you are something you aren't and saying you've done something you haven't is a patological condition. My advise to you is to seek professional help in the form of a psychiatrist.<br />
Bring your friends to Azeroth, but remember to go out of Azeroth with them as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of people don't want to read quests and don't give a crap about lore. Even if Questhelper/Carbonite/whatever didn't exist, they'd probably just skim over the quest, cry about having to do so, then go do whatever it is they have to do.<br />
<br />
The people who want to read the quests and enjoy the lore will still do so, there's nothing taking the quest text away. My first run through things, I read all the text. However, these days when leveling my alts, I don't care so much for the lore since I already know it. This feature is handy for me because I don't always remember the exact location of the objective for all 3000+ quests in WoW. I'm looking forward to this cleaner and prettier version of Quest Helper.<br />
<br />
There's no point in forcing people to read the lore part of quests if they don't want to.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">loftus</div><div class="date">2009-11-14, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Getting gear: In vanilla you couldnt even get close to raid gear from 5 mans so it was extremly hard to gear up so you could join a guild which runs MC+. I mean have you guys even tried completing the dungeon set 0,5 questline?<br />
2. Raid size: You needed to have 40 man online to go on most of the raids. This is another part of the vanilla difficulty<br />
3. Preparations for raids: In vanilla you were forced to farm endless amounts of pots before raids like AQ40 and Naxx40. <br />
<br />
The game is alot better now though. But dont say things were easy in vanilla. Farming mongoose/nr/manapots 30 hours a week was NOT easy for me atleast.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. thats true, the gearing up process in vanilla was alot more difficult.<br />
<br />
2. now this is where people saying vanilla was more difficult go off course. needing 40 players online isnt difficult. its annoying. It didnt make the content any harder for the players (the raid leader had more to organise, but the other 39 didnt) it just made it more frustrating to try to form a group with so many people.<br />
<br />
3. Yet again, not difficult. Farming, is not difficult. its tedious. killing the same mobs you know you can kill over and over for items to do a tough fight isnt difficult, it just slows down the process of getting to a tough fight with a cool boss.<br />
<br />
Alot of people arguing the case for vanilla dont even seem to understand what difficulty is. <br />
<br />
The game now relies more on players skill and ability to learn than how much time you have to play on a video game.<br />
<br />
Now the dad with 2 kids who works 7 days a week can still fit in WoW and actually get something useful done. Providing he can learn the game of course. :) <br />
<br />
I understand you were saying you prefer it now, which is great :) i was just pointing out the difference between difficulty and tediousness.<br />
<br />
I love the new quest feature, i think it looks amazing. Everyone must remember that one quest (ok like 150 lol) where you read the quest text 20 times, kept on going to the wrong area and couldnt work out what the hell you was supposed to do or where you were supposed to be. 'South of this location' Is very very vague.<br />
<br />
But of course if you do like to do it yourself and you find that more fun, it can easily be disabled :)<br />
<br />
When 75%+ (in this case i think it was more like 90%) use an add-on, its clear the add-on should be part of the game itself. As blizzard have realised, they seem to be adding more and more features that people used to have to get add-ons for before.. making the game run much smoother :)</div></div><hr />

If you're worried about this &quot;guy&quot; getting banned, why did you mention that you sold it to him in the first place? Simply linking the armory would've suffice, it's not like anyone would've known you sold it. <br />

<br />
I started the game around 2.1 or so, and thus missed a lot of the vanilla crap that people idolized. But the one event I was there to witness at ground zero was when they *gasp* added quest-givers' &quot;!&quot; and &quot;?&quot; to the mini-map. Upon reading pages and pages of complaints about how WoW was getting &quot;dumbed down&quot; and how the designers were killing exploration for putting the location of quest givers on the map, that was when I realized most people on the forums were useless pieces of human waste.<br />
<br />
^^This...<br />
<br />
I've been playing this game for about 4 years now and when I level an alt I'm not interested in the quest text. I am interested in not having to use an addon that sucks up an extra 50 Meg of ram and god only knows how many cpu cycles. Any addon being used by thousands and thousands of people that can be added to the game client is a good thing. You get a check box to turn it off so really... Use it or don't use it but if all you want to do is complain then stfu.</div></div><hr />

Even Blizz said times after time, if players back then knew the game as well as now, Vanilla would had been easy! Same with TBC! I mean come on, try to get 40 peoples on at the same time was a pain back then, and a lot of peoples didn't really understand the basic of there class! And in TBC Karazan was a challenge, you just couldn't get to lvl 80 do the attunement and zone in. You needed to get some gear before even thinking of doing it, and now in Wrath you can ding 80 and basically go in ulduar 10 off the bat! Thinks are different, you just can't compare something old with something new, our state of mind changed greatly from when we first played the game back in Vanilla! Hell we didn't had omen back then so we actually had to be careful of threat trying to not go all out!<br />
<br />
There just so much differences that you can't really compare them now! Bottom line is that all 3 are different and were equally hard in there own way!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
True, but i don't see this as forcing people to read the lore part of the quest, it's more like showing where the objectives can be met on the map, i like it.<br />
<br />
I don't feel this is dumbing down the game at all, if it helps certain member then good for blizzard for trying to cater to everyone, then again you can't please everyone. I like the new UI, it'll help out my little brother, and my son, who still ask me where is this or where is that.<br />
<br />
I agree getting 40 people to do a raid is a huge pain in the @$$, and some guilds aren't even that large. I don't see the Classic Wow as boring, each game is interesting in their own rights, if people don't like it, they shouldn't gripe about it. People will skim over the quest storyline, that's their choice, but they shouldn't complain about the game dumbing down. Blizzard is just trying to please everyone.</div></div><hr />

I don't think that the game is being dumbed down. This is more of an admission that the old quest paradigm is broken. People don't respond to blocks of text.</div></div><hr />

I just hope this wont mean that they will quit writing &quot;where to&quot; and &quot;how&quot; parts. This might happend eventually, if they did it right away shitstorm would form up pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry to say, but the only reason you may find Vanilla harder than WotLK is because it was a whole new experience for everybody back then.. you started with nothing and you had to learn your class.<br />
<br />
Today, you start a new expansion with gear that will last you almost all the way to heroic dungeons and you know your class.<br />
<br />
Beside doing heroic questing mode, I really don't see what Blizzard could do to make it harder for some people who are obviously good at playing it.. the hard modes are there for that.. if you beat the game, gratz, it might be time you look to learn something new then.</div></div><hr />

but anyway. The stats on these new pieces look very nice but what is up with all the haste? everything has haste. Why was there such a focus on haste gear in this expansion then there was in BC?
