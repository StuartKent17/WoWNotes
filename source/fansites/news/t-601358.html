Can't get much about the new arena season in the patch files, will have to wait until the servers are up. <br />
<br />
Seems the Creature\Band\ models got themselves some instruments. According to the sound file named DMF_L70ETC01.mp3, we can assume they will be playing in the Darkmoon Faire<br />

<br />
Someone sent me these informations about the band by mail. L60ETC on WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Level_60_Elite_Tauren_Chieftain)<br />
<br />
I don't know if anyone has pointed this out, but the symbol on the drums is &quot;L70ETC,&quot; which stands for Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain. This is the same band that did the &quot;The Power of the Horde&quot; metal track in WarCraft 3: The Frozen Throne. They were called Level 10 Elite Tauren Chieftain then, and changed their name to Level 60 Elite Tauren Chieftain when WoW came out. They also played Blizzcon the last year it was held.<br />
<br />
Maybe an in-game concert by L70ETC?<br />
<br />
Ezra's quest (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/june/ezraquest.jpg) is in the patch. (Full story here (http://blogs.ocregister.com/gadgetress/archives/2007/05/wishing_for_war.html) and here (http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/money/article_1702706.php))<br />

<br />
T6 blue = next gladiator set is my wager.<br />
<br />
I'll post some screens in a sec</div></div><hr />

The texture in the first screen appears incorrect, as every time I open it now it is just plain white and glowing. The texture that has actually been seen is applied to the item after its rises a bit out of the ground, sending the blueish-black shockwave.<br />
<br />

http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a23/LgEnder/glaive2.jpg<br />
<br />
Looks like the glaive is meant to fall and stick into the floor after killing Illidan, but who knows if a quest is needed etc. Speculation time!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-06-07, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's during the fight actually, and I mentionned it ^^<br />

But personally I can't get the texture working on wowmodelviewer, don't know why.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDlTqbPilcg<br />
<br />
I hope you enjoy, I think I managed to include every animation of all characters.</div></div><hr />
