Blizzard has changed up their branding once again! <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/august/thumb/battleblizzardnetwut.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/august/battleblizzardnetwut.jpg) <br />
<br />
When we announced that we’d be transitioning away from the Battle.net name for our online-gaming service, we suspected that the shift would be challenging. We understood that Battle.net stood for something special—it represents years of shared history and enjoyment, community and friendship, for all of us and our players.<br />
<br />
Battle.net is the central nervous system for Blizzard games and the connective tissue that has brought Blizzard players together since 1996. The technology was never going away, but after giving the branding change further consideration and also hearing your feedback, we’re in agreement that the name should stay as well. Take it from the developer formerly known as Silicon &amp; Synapse, and Chaos Studios, names are important too.<br />
<br />
Moving forward, to help offset some of the original concerns we listed back in September, we will be connecting “Blizzard” to “Battle.net” in our logo for the service and in general when we refer to it in print: Blizzard Battle.net.<br />
<br />
We appreciate your feedback and look forward to many more years of bringing players together online.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<br />
it doesn't really matter, yet you feel the need to tell others to move on? Clearly, it does somewhat then, especially if you think such an indifferent post suggested the need to &quot;move on&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Kinda feels like, say, &quot;Marvel's Daredevil,&quot; where they get the company brand name out there while the popular brand name is preserved, and most people were just gonna keep calling it battle.net/b.net anyway, so it's a good middle ground. Accomplishes the goal Blizz had in mind (make it more logical for b.net noobs) while maintaining the popular brand legacy.</div></div><hr />

Most people were going to keep calling it battle.net, b.net, battlenet, or bnet anyway.<br />
<br />
Reminds me of what happened to a strip mall near me. Had one name for decades, then the owners decided to change the name. 20 years after the name was changed people still called it by the old name. When a new company bought the strip mall, they changed it back to the original name because that was what everyone was still calling it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who said anything about wanting to change reality? I swear to friggin god toxic people will always be toxic. I simply stated that I didn't know it was a thing before Wrath era. I thought it was something they introduced back in Wrath to tie all the games together and to discourage account selling. Prior to WoW, I never played a Blizzard game. I was always a fighting game player. PLEASE tell me how that means I am trying to change anything?</div></div><hr />

It's a big deal for nerds for the same reason Netflix got shit for trying to rebrand their DVD service &quot;Qwixter.&quot; It's a big deal for Blizzard because branding is a big fuckin' deal</div></div><hr />

Yes. Stop projecting your own apathy. Branding is incredibly important to a lot of people.</div></div><hr />

What problems do you think I have that is causing my apathy towards a name change of a company's app's name?<br />

I think that's kind of the point. If everybody is calling it battle.net anyway, it would be prudent to actually name it such so those few that haven't heard of it before can easily find it.</div></div><hr />

Interestingly enough, it actually is. Blizzard isn't that uncommon of a word, so by itself it could wind up being confusing to people who are unfamiliar with the company. Battle.net on the other hand has quite a bit of history behind it, and players familiar with Blizzard continued to use it regardless of whether or not the name of the service changed. This could lead to confusion for new players just joining the community, this change pretty much prevents that from being an issue.</div></div><hr />

I guess you've forgotten Activision's intent -- ignore Blizz's BS about how they &quot;love it so much&quot;, it's an Activision move -- to have Destiny 2 on Blizzard's launcher.<br />
<br />
<br />
Least its not &quot;Activision Launcher&quot;. TBF whatever its called doesn't really matter same thing just a logo/name.<br />
<br />
Why do people act like the Activision part of Activision Blizzard has any say in what the Blizzard Entertainment part of the company does? Activision is the smallest part of the company and would no longer exist if it weren't for blizzard and King (Blizzard is currently sitting on larger profits than king, which may be the the first time since activision blizzard acquired king? don't quote me on that though). <br />
<br />
In short, there is no way the Big Dog is being bullied by the Little Dog, that's just delusional. Also, it's good for the company as a whole to get Destiny 2 out on the launcher, people who may never try Destiny if it were elsewhere may try it, and it may bring Destiny fans to Blizzard games.<br />

Just for the brand logo, for verbal conversation it'll probably just be referred to as Battle.net. Just like how Blizzard's full Brand logo is Blizzard Entertainment but it's hardly ever referred to in full.</div></div><hr />

Well it wasn't a big deal..<br />

But since they reasoned the change for avoiding confusions and such. And existing users still would call the service as battle.net but new players only see Blizzard app or whatever. Isn't that more confusing ?<br />

And it's very likely someone who isn't a fan of Blizzard starting to play games through Battle.net might not get it right away, and it probably happened with Overwatch already.
