Well that confirms a refund for me, the cinematic was decent though, as was the animated series, but meh, I've waited long enough with the same content I'm not going to wait months longer.</div></div><hr />

10 actually, since WOW's birthday fall on the 23rd. But I assume Blizz will probably give us plenty of time to get the mount :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I had the same thought as you. I was thinking around Black Friday for increased sales. I guess this time they will have it out and ready for the shopping season.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monzsterr</div><div class="date">2014-08-14, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That date... sigh.<br />
What to do until then. Hope 6.0 comes in September rather than leaving us until October.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallahadd</div><div class="date">2014-08-14, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome cinematic, good to know that even when not corrupted by Felblood, Orcs are still PROPER dickheads.<br />
<br />
So with a street date of 13 November, we can assume 6.0 will be some time in early October right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But still means 3 more months of the same raid, but at least it now means I will get WoD for free since the 5 months sub I am saving will pay for it</div></div><hr />

They can just boost peeps to 100 as they do on beta for dungeons/raids.</div></div><hr />

Only takes like 12 hours to hit 100, I realize not everyone has all day to play but that's extremely reasonable leveling time.</div></div><hr />

You do realize the Horde had as much screentime as the Alliance there right? Just be cause they're orcs doesn't mean they're Horde.<br />
<br />
Pretty amazing cinematic. Altho if you think about it, the tone of the enemy we're fighting is the same as in 5.4. More &quot;bad&quot; &quot;horde&quot;. But we'll see how things turn out, much may happen. =P in blizz we trust!<br />
<br />
If the orcs on the movie look nearly as good as that I'm guessing it will be def worth to watch =P (tho they might look weird when side-by-side with real actors).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Garrosh is still evil and is not (from our point of view) a good guy. Keep in mind that these orcs in the cinematic are not 'The Horde'. They're the orcs on Draenor. Garrosh has swayed his father Gromm Hellscream to full on attack Azeroth, for vengeance purposes mostly I would reckon (which is the main event we try to prevent). <br />
<br />
So even though in the real Warcraft timeline Gromm (after actually drinking the blood - and doing so again some 25 years later) becomes a hero by freeing the orcs of their corruption and ties to demons, we have to presume that this Gromm is bad because of Garrosh's influence and the fact that he wants to destroy Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Garrosh opening a portal into the past of an alternate reality(whatever) and wanting to lead the Iron Horde into real Azeroth. We are following him and stopping the Iron Horde cause we like current Azeroth. We will finally be successfull...end of story. <br />
<br />
If you know anything about alternate reality and time travel in games/movies then it's that you should NOT take a second look at the storyline cause it's ALWAYS bull****...WoD won't be an exception there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cinematic was well done...but didn't catch me at all emotionally. I didn't have the feeling taht I need to get there and stop them, or that I should feel threatened...or that I should explore something. No &quot;come play me&quot; all at. It was like...ehm...watching a movie.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard said it at last years blizz con. Basicly Garrosh is being used to change history. ( what faction in game has been known to want to re-write history? )<br />
Infinites? Garrosh is merely the catalyst to start world changing events. The pawn.<br />

And we, ally or horde... Are going to be tasked, likely by the current factions, to stop the iron horde from destroying the current Azeroth.<br />

The cinematic was kinda disappointing, too. Not bad, but too short for my taste.<br />
<br />
You do know that, that cinematic is actually the longest blizzard have ever made for World of warcraft. lasted almost 5 minutes.<br />
So.. wouldn't really call it short..</div></div><hr />

I'm surprised anyone is still defending it. I made it to VR10 b4 craglorn hit and still couldn't bring myself to resub for the raid content. They really destroyed that series for me.

How can anyone say Wrath's was better, he raised a dragon....and we saw his army.<br />
<br />
And there goes Mannoroth final boss speculation, Bam. The WC3 reference gave me chills too. I have just from spoilers of WoD grown to fully appreciate and like Garrosh now, ashame.<br />
<br />
I'm also against killing Grom too. At this point it would be amazing to have them side with us to take on the burning legion &amp; Guldan (Hopes for AU KARA with Medivh)</div></div><hr />

Really great seeing savage warrior orcs again instead of &quot;Goel&quot; the redeemer with soft human like orcs. <br />
<br />
It gets me really excited to fight them as the alliance, to have worthy enemy again and just have an all out war. It's really nice to see orcs with some flavor, it really sucks when all races start acting just like humans with different skin colors. <br />
<br />
But I suppose the best news is the release date. Since it's been so long without anything new I can imagine they're under a lot of pressure to release the game soon. But with so much seemingly needing to be sorted still it's great to hear that they won't pushing out a broken product just to appease fans short term.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im not going to bother. Blizzard has fooled me to many times by claiming they are changing their ways and speeding up expansions. History will show they are not... and obviously do not intend to. As a sub based game... more than whole year without updates on live servers is disgrace. That's when I say &quot;no thank you&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nefastus</div><div class="date">2014-08-14, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say I found the intro rather astounishing. Granted I am not playing anymore but this was pretty cool. Only missed Mannoroth eating all pandas first and mind wipping everyone from the pandamon xpac. Kung fu pandas dont belong in here, huge ass demons and crazed orcs do. Thats what I was hoping to see back in warcraft. <br />
<br />
I admit the time traveling to another version of draenor that in the end has nothing to do with the past draenor in our time (as we are not really touching our past) is kinda weird but still I praise their attempt to bring back the game. I didnt like much Gul'dan voice, would rather him sound older or something and perhaps having him killed right in there. Lorewise there is no chance Grom jr. would let him live or the horde and alliance that gets throught the portal. He would be target number one in ANY circustance. No matter how dangerous these iron horde could become it would still pale in comparison to the burning legion or their hability to make the scourge.</div></div><hr />

I mean the horde Garrison is still snow covered. I assume since we aren't in the snow lands anymore but in Ashran instead that is some older footage. I haven't given much of Beta a poke yet, but I figured it wouldn't be snow ground in the Horde Garrison. Then again changing the ground texture is probably pretty simple.<br />
<br />
The horde garrison is in Frostfire Ridge, a snowy landscape. The &quot;capital city&quot; (think Shrine of the Two Moons) is just outside Ashran. They are NOT the same thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? Just seemed like two villains fighting, albeit one fighting an even greater villain.<br />

After all, since Grom never sacrificed himself to save the Orcs from Mannoroth, he is not redeemed, thus remaining a villain.</div></div><hr />

Garrosh just slapped the face of Sageras. YOU think the Burning Legion in their timeline or our timeline is going to be happy with the events that just took place. Yes we will start the expansion trying to stop the Iron Horde however, I don't think the Burning Legion is going to take sides. I believe that we will have to join forces with the Iron Horde before its over with in the expansion and I see someone from the Burning Legion coming forth as the last boss in WoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then I saw the vid with the zones/mobs/raid, and quickly realized I just had a lore hype, no reason to resub<br />
<br />
My thoughts exactly. Cinematic was pretty good, but the &quot;features&quot; video made me remember how little new things there are this expansion...<br />
<br />
New bgs? Nope (Ashran isn't a bg, a nice way to kill time maybe).<br />
<br />
Garrisons? The customization is mostly gone and it doesn't look like a big part of gameplay<br />
<br />
New zones, raids and dungeons? Yep, pretty standard, you can't do an expansion without those.<br />
<br />
Aaaand that's about it...<br />

<br />
I REALLY like the nod to the old cinematic. I played WC3 back in the day and I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw Garrosh move in to save Grom from the same blast that hits him originally. It'd have been even better if they went all the way and had Grom hit Mannoroth in the chest instead of the head and if we saw the deflection of the iron star with his wing in the same way we see the deflection of Thrall's hammer in the original, but ah well.<br />
<br />
Also, I like how Mannoroth's voice is identical to his WC3 voice. I'm glad they didn't ruin him like they did with Arthas, Jaina, etc. I don't know if Metzen voice acted the entire cinematic or what as someone else said, but considering the voice acting quality is far better than what we've been used to in recent years, I'd guess that's quite possible. Puts those &quot;professional&quot; voice actors to shame. Bunch of amateurs.</div></div><hr />

The Horde also get to kill them, so that argument is null. The Horde have a tonne of a villains and heroes in this expansion, while the Alliance gets a small handful of heroes, one of the major ones being killed off before the first patch even hits.<br />
<br />
So that's +2 for the Horde and +1 for the Alliance atm.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad they didn't do it.<br />
Because it also shows, how much determination went into that blow.<br />
<br />
Let's face it: When Grom killed Mannoroth in our timeline, he managed to do so with what seems like more of a lucky hit, striking a part in Mannoroth's chest that wasn't protected by his armor.<br />
But here he's 100% making sure he will die thus splitting his skull.</div></div><hr />

I assure you i do not have an axe to grind with blizzard. The cinimatic just didnt really impress me in any way. unlike the last 5 warcraft cinimatics, or even the diablo 2 and starcraft 2 cinimatics i kinda just felt nothing. <br />
<br />
The Lords of war animation however i thought was WAY better then the dreanor cinimatic and i can not wait to see more. It did what the cinimatic did not and made it so i look forward to the game and finding out what happens next.<br />

As for it being Horde centric. Not really. Those for the most part, at least at the moment, are enemies of both the alliance and horde. They intent to invade and destroy both sides and replace it all with them. It might be called a &quot;Horde&quot; but it isn't the Horde that Horde players play in. <br />

Dwarves are totally pathetic now - some *self censoring* dwarf I personally killed better than 100 times in vanilla in BRD is now somehow leading the dwarves of Ironforge after the idiot dwarven king &quot;delved too deep&quot; and turned himself into a gem. Really Blizz? REALLY?<br />

Im getting a bit bored of all the orc focus though.. But thats just a feeling I got, cant help it! That said, I love the brutality &amp; wildness(cant find the right words) in the orcs. Thats why I rolled a Orc warrior, mainly cause of the cool cinematics Blizzard has done with them. A angry green orc with axe! How cool is that!? :P Btw, my main is a Human Paladin :p<br />
<br />
On the release date.. As expected really. I said for a long time that I would expect a LATE October release as a early release. I dont mind really... When WoD comes out its deep dark here and wintertime and that means gaming time :P</div></div><hr />
