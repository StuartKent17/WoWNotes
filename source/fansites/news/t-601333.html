So ... What does it mean ? High-rating Arena teams will loose points, a lot of points. (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=106864957&amp;pageNo=2&amp;sid=1#33) And you can check how many here (http://www.frals.net/wow/calc.php)<br />
<br />
The first graphic shows a comparison of how much points you get every week before and after the nerf. (The graphic was stolen from Curse-gaming.com (http://www-en.curse-gaming.com/articles/details/1998/) without even asking for their authorization)<br />

This one shows how much points you lose compared to the last version. (Posted on the official post by Zaleiria (http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Bonechewer&amp;n=Zaleiria))<br />

I mean you currently get more points from 5on5 than from 2on2 and 3on3. This post generalizes all types? Or is it about 5on5 solely, since that graph from Curse-Gaming shows in the old version you got 1100 points from a 2k rating. I got less than that in my 2on2 team at 2050 rating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
still sucks that they do that, cuz then the regular noobs can almost get the same rewards with 1900 rating as a team with 2400, and the only thing you want to keep it that high is cuz of an epeen maybe or by winning the season..</div></div><hr />
