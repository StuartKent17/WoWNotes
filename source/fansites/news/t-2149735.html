Since the release of Patch 7.1.5, we've received a number of questions relating to the Nighthold Legendary item upgrades and how that process will work. We'd like to provide some clarity on what you can expect next week.<br />
<br />
When the Nighthold opens next week, players who have acquired at least one Legion Legendary item will find a quest in Dalaran (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/45352-touch-of-a-titan) to upgrade a Legendary from item level 910 to 940. This quest involves collecting a number of Essences of Amanâ€™thul (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143614-essence-of-amanthul), which can be found in the following locations:<br />
<br />
<br />
Nighthold Raid Bosses<br />
Weekly Mythic Keystone Cache<br />
Emissary Bags<br />
PvP Weekly Quests<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you have completed the quest, you'll be given a Distilled Titan Essence (http://www.wowdb.com/items/143613-distilled-titan-essence), which can be consumed to upgrade a Legion Legendary item to level 940. The quest is repeatable, so you'll be able to earn as many Distilled Titan Essences as you need to upgrade any Legendaries you have.<br />
<br />
Additionally, once the Nighthold is open, any new Legendaries you discover will already be item level 940. Note that this does not apply retroactively to Emissary Bags that you may already have in your inventory when the time comes. Only new bags earned after the Nighthold is open have the chance to reward an item level 940 Legendary.</div></div><hr />

50 ok but are we blocked by a heading per week ???<br />

it's really joke... u loot legendary one day before, and no it s not 940..</div></div><hr />

Loot is generated upon opening the emissary caches, not receiving them. This is proven by the fact that if you held onto them until this week, all the loot tables changed to include the new legendaries, enchanting recipes, and higher curious coin droprate. Unless they add an emissary cache with a different item ID that will be the one you recieve post-NH opening, there's no way for them to differentiate between a cache recieved a month ago and a cache recieved next week.<br />
(Hint: the patch didn't contain any new emissary caches with different item IDs. They don't exist)<br />
<br />
Edit: There's a chance they might do a micro patch that literally just adds new versions of the caches and they push that patch live during the weekly maintenance on the 17th, which would make my post inaccurate, but as of yet it hasn't happened so it's still worth saving your caches for an extra week. Also since the essences for the legendary upgrade drop from the caches you'll be able to get them next week too, giving you a head start on the quest.</div></div><hr />

Why are there inconsistencies like this o_O Either make them all require quest items, or make them all just hotfixed each new patch</div></div><hr />

That's like being mad you bought a DVD player when they first came out 20 years ago for $1200 and now complain people can pick it up for $50.<br />
You had your Legendary for a long time already, and you're pissed about somebody getting a 940 when they finally receive one? &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
to explain what i mean, they added mythic dungeons (nothing but glorified heroics) and locked them out of lfd, they will change that.<br />
<br />
they made AK char bound, they changed it.<br />
<br />
they made legendaries have a cap on BLP, they removed it.<br />
<br />
<br />
this change means people will get those upgrades for they main and their offspecs eventually, even on alts that they only have time to do LFR in.<br />
<br />
<br />
the one thing that still puzzles me is why they didn't do this from the start... ALL legendaries should have been available to all players at 110, but being low ilvl 835ish or something, and have them upgradeable with the upgrade time linked to the content you do. and done, players now get to CHOOSE which one they like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well you obviously don't understand how legendary drop rates work... they removed the legendary soft cap (you were getting no bad luck protection) that was in place but getting another legendary when you had already one still is still exponentially more difficult than the last. So right now its very very hard to get another legendary after the 3rd... 4th and 5th are off for most of the playerbase except for the totally dedicated or very lucky... unless they change that... nobody is gonna get their upgrades for main and offspecs because the way it is right now if you get 3 or 4 crappy legendaries its better to just reroll a new one and try again.</div></div><hr />

No, it's more like if you bought a blu ray player a year ago and then they make a newer better version today and the store refuses to sell you the new one unless you go to the store for 50 days straight begging them to give you a new one meanwhile someone who never bought one is given the new one for the same price you paid for the original.<br />

Tell me where new players can buy a Legendary, or get a free one.<br />
The player who had the 910 version can get a 940 version the same day as New Guy Joe does when 7.15 goes live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, BLP doesn't work less when you have one.. <br />
<br />
But yeah, you are right.. forgot that they changed it in 7.1, so players without a legendary have a little higher base chance than people with a legendary..<br />
<br />
But I don't see how this is unfair.. you already have a legendary. Someone who started after patch 7.1, will have a little higher start chance, than you did before patch 7.1.. but you already have a legendary, they don't.. stop being so greedy.<br />
<br />
The guy whom you initially quoted, still has a valid comparison.<br />
<br />
Person A (who got a legendary before 7.1), had a 2% chance for a legendary.<br />
Then Patch 7.1 hits, and the price is &quot;lowered&quot; to 4% chance for a legendary (for someone who has no legendary)..<br />
Person B (who does not have a legendary), now get the first legendary at a cheaper price.. <br />
<br />
While making the price a little cheaper for a first time user. They also added 30 new features(DLC), that both Person A and B can get(buy).<br />
<br />
Where each of those features(DLC), has a base price of 2%, and then a BLP that will give you a discount based on amount of content you do.</div></div><hr />

It should either be that ALL legendaries start out at 910 and have to be upgraded, or ALL of them automatically gets changed to 940.</div></div><hr />

I don't trust this for a second. People were getting the NEW legendaries from stockpiled emissaries yesterday. Same with curious coins. Pls Blizzard check yo shit<br />

While this is true, there is no guarentee that this also means that their ilvl work that way. I don't see any reason why they should lie about it. But you are ofc free to keep your caches if you want to.</div></div><hr />

Was looking for an analogy to answer to the complaint. This one sums it up for me.<br />
<br />
Really, is this what the players have become? Now having 6 legendaries is not enough? They have to construct a situation where &quot;a casual&quot; will get a ilv 940 legendary while they &quot;only&quot; have six and are now &quot;forced&quot; to upgrade them?<br />
<br />
Enter a new wave of &quot;I quit over this&quot; threads, because having six legendaries &quot;only&quot; at 940 makes the game unplayable and ruins the fun?<br />
<br />
(Before anyone gets pissy, I have 4 very mediocre legendaries and I do not care)</div></div><hr />

It's irrelevant what &quot;casuals&quot; get or don't get. It impacts people who wants to stay competitive in PvE.<br />
<br />
Say two raiders both have 2 legendaries each. They've had them for quite some time now, and because of the Bad Luck Protection they will most likely get their 3rd legendaries soon. One of them, Raider 1, gets a decent one at the end this week, at 910 ilv. The other one, Raider 2, gets a decent one next week instead, only a couple of days later, at 940 ilvl. Raider 1 must now suddenly spend x number of weeks to upgrade his legendary to be at the same level as Raider 2. It will also statistically take a longer time before he gets another legendary now(that would have been a &quot;free&quot; 940).<br />
<br />
Perhaps not a big deal for most people, but still a backwards system that punishes people who got &quot;lucky&quot; enough to get legendaries before Nighthold.</div></div><hr />

Honestly i couldn't care less about what others get. What bothers me is how stupid it is to have both a catch-up mechanic and a progress mechanic at the same time affecting the exact same items. Why have an arbitrary wall for some players or items at the same time that you are giving a way to totally avoid that wall.</div></div><hr />

Say two raiders both have 2 legendaries each. They've had them for quite some time now, and because of the Bad Luck Protection they will most likely get their 3rd legendaries soon. One of them, Raider 1, gets a decent one at the end this week, at 910 ilv. The other one, Raider 2, gets a decent one next week instead, only a couple of days later, at 940 ilvl. Raider 1 must now suddenly spend x number of weeks to upgrade his legendary to be at the same level as Raider 2. It will also statistically take a longer time before he gets another legendary now(that would have been a &quot;free&quot; 940).<br />
<br />
Perhaps not a big deal for most people, but still a backwards system that punishes people who got &quot;lucky&quot; enough to get legendaries before Nighthold.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I file that under &quot; not a big deal for most people&quot;<br />

I don't get it. If you never had gotten that legendary, there is no guaranty you'd gotten one after 7.2 (and who knows when that will be released). So now in a ilv 840 slot, you have a ilv 910 item - but you go &quot;the glas is half empty&quot;<br />

How did you people deal with RNG and bad luck in the previous 11 years of WoW?</div></div><hr />

If they are in mythic EN killing bosses its probably only gonna be able to replace a 880-895 item. Just to clarify, and I feel the same way I got my 4th Tuesday on my mage and it makes for 3 terrible none class specific ones and 1 that actually helps with dps. Disheartening knowing it will be another 2-6 weeks before getting another one, thankfully I should be out of bad legendary items to get now.</div></div><hr />

What's so hard to get? People were grinding possible legendary drops for weeks to increase their chance at getting a legendary. And then they have the bad luck to lose all their bad luck protection (sic!) in the days before the items are upgraded by 30 itemlevel. And the same logic will also apply in the weeks before 7.2 will be released, considering the legendaries will receive another update.<br />
I will try to do as less as possible legendary-rewarding content this week on my chars where I know they are ripe for another legendary, I am really not interested in rewarding my grinding with another grinding that you have to do additionally to your continued grinding.</div></div><hr />

It's my 5th legendary (flame inc) - I'm not going to equip it as a 910 as I'm limited to two, I already had to farm 200 of this quest item, and now 250. I was already going to get a 5th legendary at some point, sucks to get it 5 days before a patch that boosts it to 940 making it a day 1 equip.<br />

This is essentially blizzard adding the concept of legacy equipment. Prior to this when did blizzard update items and only update a subset of them (in this case, the newer ones being better than the old) and acquired in the exact same manner. Obviously, they've done this with mounts like the 4 chest ZA, and achievements that were time sensitive, but equipment?</div></div><hr />

<br />
they jsut made it really akwards system instead simply go with all legendaries are 910 and if you want 940 farm essences. what we have now will be royal shitshow with people in mythic guild really rerolling to the same class which will get bis 940 legendaries.</div></div><hr />
