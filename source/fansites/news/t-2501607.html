<br />
Patch 8.2.5 PTR - Bee Mount Alliance Exclusive<br />
We knew going into the PTR that the bee mount was going to be an Alliance specific quest chain, but many assumed it would work much like Kua'fon (https://www.wowdb.com/items/159146-kuafons-harness) and Child of Torcali (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168408-child-of-torcali) which are usable on Alliance even though the methods to obtain them are Horde exclusive. Currently on the PTR, the Honeyback Harvester's Harness (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/170069-honeyback-harvesters-harness) is the only bee mount in the mount journal and has the Alliance symbol next to it, meaning it is only rideable by Alliance characters. This could change, however, as the PTR is still early.<br />

<br />
<br />
Patch 8.2.5 PTR - New Addition to the Mount Journal Preview<br />
Currently on the PTR, when you preview a mount in the Mount Journal, you now see your character riding the mount!<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Patch 8.2.5 PTR - Party Sync New Quest Tracker UI Elements<br />
The Patch 8.2.5 PTR is currently testing the new party sync feature, and the quest tracker ui now has two new icons to let you know if you are replaying a quest you completed and whether or not you will receive bonus loot for participating.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 8.2.5 PTR - New Character Menu UI Updates<br />
The Patch 8.2.5 PTR updated the character menu UI to display an opaque logo of the character's faction as well as their class name being color-coded like in game.<br />

<br />
Alliance can get all of those mounts in some other ways though, you can get the tick, the hyena, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna riot in the street over a bee, but you can use the mounts from our unique quest lines, so why not vice versa.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or it just means that they want an easy way of showing which character belongs to which faction. Given that there is a divide and the list currently only shows the name, class, level and location, it makes sense to add that information. This is could be especially useful given that players can now allocate all 50 of their character slots to a single realm.<br />
<br />
A simple Horde/Alliance icon is a lot easier and generally more far more informative than trying to fit in the race name (which also wouldn't be any help for determining the faction of a Pandaren character.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Why are there even Pandaren there? They won't get an allied race equivalent.<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't know what to do with the pandaren leaders, and has no plans for them going forwards. So putting them in the embassy gives them something to do, if nothing else. Removing the other leaders means that blizzard can add significantly more allied races later without the embassies becoming crowded with leaders, and also means they can have some major plot stuff happen with those characters (deaths/betrayals/etc) without the awkward issue of them standing forever in the embassy for the Allied Race stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the Embassy changes, guys, that's not really indicative of anything. They're probably just keeping the lore consistent by showing that the faction leaders you just spoke to in Boralus/Dazaralor, the ones either MIA or in Nazjatar, are not also chilling in the faction tent. I might be wrong but I really don't think they'd just silently try to sneak in &quot;no more allied races&quot; this way.</div></div><hr />

As a horde member who hates alliance scum - I am ok with the restrictions. Yes I am jealous, but I think it is ok for both sides to have their own mounts. I don't like that someone can just create a toon and do some quests so their other faction toons can use the mounts.<br />
<br />
Blizzard gets around this by making things tied to achievements instead of rep. Which I think it the most absurd thing.<br />
Achievement rewards = all toons can use it.<br />
Rep rewards = only the toon who earned it can use it. Make getting exalted an achievement or account bound.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not gonna riot in the street over a bee, but you can use the mounts from our unique quest lines, so why not vice versa.<br />
<br />
As an Alliance main, I fully support that. Treat the bee like the Kua'fon questline (sorry if I misspelled that).<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
&quot;meaning it is only rideable by Alliance characters. This could change, however, as the PTR is still early.&quot;<br />
<br />
Why should this change ? Is the ravasaur from Un'goro rideable by Alliance ? No. So let the bee be (huhu) Alliance only.<br />
<br />
The ravasaur has its Alliance counterpart in the Winterspring Frostsaber.<br />
<br />
The bee should work just like the Horde-only questline mounts in BfA. Keep the questline Alliance-only, but let Horde toons ride it.</div></div><hr />

It looks like at some point in the future just knowing character's race wont be enough to know it's faction (9.0 faction merge/split reference)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would be happy if it finally pointed to future Good vs Evil WoW with orcs, tauren, humans and forsaken on the same side (ie Defias affiliated humans on Horde). Especially since they know it works for Pandaren.</div></div><hr />

nah they shouldn't there can be a rare drop one from the zone that will cost around 100k on the ah since that's how alliance get access to all the unique mounts horde get.</div></div><hr />

The real big news here is the character UI. Just one more big clue that soon we will be able to choose our faction despite our race. That's a far bigger deal.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laqweeta</div><div class="date">2019-08-07, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or it just means that they want an easy way of showing which character belongs to which faction. Given that there is a divide and the list currently only shows the name, class, level and location, it makes sense to add that information. This is could be especially useful given that players can now allocate all 50 of their character slots to a single realm.<br />
<br />
A simple Horde/Alliance icon is a lot easier and generally more far more informative than trying to fit in the race name (which also wouldn't be any help for determining the faction of a Pandaren character.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't know what to do with the pandaren leaders, and has no plans for them going forwards. So putting them in the embassy gives them something to do, if nothing else. Removing the other leaders means that blizzard can add significantly more allied races later without the embassies becoming crowded with leaders, and also means they can have some major plot stuff happen with those characters (deaths/betrayals/etc) without the awkward issue of them standing forever in the embassy for the Allied Race stuff.<br />
<br />
Why though? When I log on, I don't think to myself &quot;was the Druid I was playing last night Horde or Alliance?!&quot; I feel like there's something more to this.</div></div><hr />

If a more fluid faction format is coming, dropping both horde/alliance and returning as one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Screw having to repeat everything on both factions to get mounts (Faction rewards), races (Allied races) or even pets.</div></div><hr />

Oh ... FFS! One unique Alliace mount and all those horde mounts and people are loosing their minds? Is this satire? Try having 5 reskinned horses as the depth of your variety. Come on .... let Alliance have this ONE!<br />
