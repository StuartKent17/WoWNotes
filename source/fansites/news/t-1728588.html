<br />
Want to buy a WoW Token for gold? Head to the new Game Time tab in the Auction House, and purchase one immediately for the current gold buyout price—there’s no bidding involved.<br />
<br />
When you put a WoW Token up for sale, you’ll be quoted the amount of gold you’ll receive once someone buys it—you’re guaranteed to get that amount no matter how the market moves.<br />
<br />
The WoW Token was created to give players with lots of extra gold the option to use it to help cover their subscription cost, and give those who want to purchase gold a way to do so from fellow players through a secure, easy-to-use system. The Token will be making its debut in an upcoming patch—in the meantime, check out the FAQ below for details on how it works.<br />
<br />
FAQ<br />
<br />
THE BASICS<br />
<br />
Q: How do I buy a WoW Token for real money?<br />
A: WoW Tokens will be available for purchase for real money through the World of Warcraft in-game Shop. You can access the Shop through the row of feature buttons next to your character’s bags.<br />
<br />
Q: I need gold! How do I sell a WoW Token to another player?<br />
A: You’ll be able to sell WoW Tokens through a dedicated Token exchange in the Auction House, located in a new Game Time section. WoW Tokens cannot be traded or sold any other way.<br />
<br />
Q: How much gold will I receive when I sell a WoW Token?<br />
A: The gold value of a Token will be determined dynamically based on supply and demand. When you put a Token up for sale, you’ll be quoted the amount of gold you’ll receive upon a successful sale. If you then decide to place the Token up for sale, that amount is locked in, and the gold will be sent to your mailbox after another player purchases your Token.<br />
<br />
Q: I need game time! How do I buy a WoW Token from the Auction House?<br />
A: When you visit the Auction House, you’ll be presented with the current market price for a WoW Token in your game region—there’s no bidding involved, and all Tokens in a game region are priced the same at any given moment. If you decide to purchase one, you’ll receive it in your mailbox, and can then immediately redeem it for game time.<br />
<br />
Q: How much game time do I get by redeeming a WoW Token?<br />
A: You’ll receive 30 days of game time when you redeem a WoW Token.<br />
<br />
Q: Can I resell a WoW Token after I’ve purchased it for gold?<br />
A: No, each WoW Token can only be sold once. After you purchase a Token for gold, it becomes Soulbound. At that point, it can only be redeemed for game time.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE DETAILS<br />
<br />
Q: How much will a WoW Token cost on the Shop?<br />
A: Pricing details will be announced at a later date.<br />
<br />
Q: Why are you introducing the WoW Token feature?<br />
A: We’ve heard feedback from players that they’d be interested in a secure, legitimate way to acquire gold that doesn’t involve the use of unauthorized third-party gold-selling services—one of the primary sources of account compromises. We also know players who’ve amassed large amounts of gold through regular play would be interested in the ability to trade some to other players in exchange for game time, helping cover their subscription costs. <br />
<br />
The WoW Token feature gives players on both sides of the equation a secure and straightforward way to make that exchange. It opens up a new kind of payment option for World of Warcraft players, and we hope that it will also help lead to fewer account compromises and a better game experience overall.<br />
<br />
Q: How is acquiring gold by selling a WoW Token different from buying gold from third-party services?<br />
A: Buying gold from third-party services negatively impacts the game experience for everyone. The overwhelming majority of the gold these services provide comes from stolen player accounts, halting the victims’ ability to play the game and contribute to their guilds. On top of this, gold selling companies often farm resources using hack programs, sell fake product codes as a scam, and spam entire realms with ads to buy gold, disrupting the game in very real ways.<br />
<br />
The WoW Token allows players to exchange real money for gold in a secure and sanctioned way—together with the ongoing efforts of our developers, support staff, and anti-hack teams to stop the exploits these companies use and help players who have become victims of their operations, we hope the Token can help make World of Warcraft a safer and more enjoyable game for all of our players.<br />
<br />
Q: Why can’t players set their own prices for the WoW Token?<br />
A: The WoW Token feature is designed to facilitate the exchange of gold and game time between players in as secure, convenient, and fair a way as possible, and without making players feel like they’re playing a game with their hard-earned money. Having a set current market price and a straightforward exchange system is the best way to achieve that—you don’t need to worry about whether your Token will sell or not due to being undercut or the market shifting, and everyone receives exactly the amount of gold they were quoted.<br />
<br />
Q: What happens if the price quoted to me is different from what the Token actually sells for?<br />
A: You will always receive the gold amount quoted to you at the time you place a Token up for sale, regardless of what the current price is when the item actually sells.<br />
<br />
Q: How long should I expect to receive my gold after putting a Token up for sale? How does the game determine whose Token to sell?<br />
A: The amount of time it takes to receive your gold after putting a Token up for sale depends on a variety of factors, including the current supply and demand. When you list a Token, you’ll be quoted an estimated time based on the current Token supply and the rate of recent transactions, but the actual amount of time it takes to sell is likely to vary (note that Tokens do not expire). In most cases, Tokens are sold in the order in which they were put up for sale; however, there are some exceptions to this, such as when a Token purchase is undergoing verification.<br />
<br />
Q: If I buy a WoW Token from the Auction House, how long does it take to receive the Token?<br />
A: Just like a standard Auction House purchase, it will normally arrive in your mailbox nearly instantaneously.<br />
<br />
Q: If I’m buying a WoW Token for real money from the in-game Shop, how long does it take to receive it?<br />
A: Once you successfully complete a purchase, your Token should arrive in your inventory (or mailbox, if your inventory is full) almost immediately.<br />
<br />
Q: Do Tokens expire? What happens if I accidentally delete one?<br />
A: No, Tokens do not expire. They also can’t be deleted, so no need to fear accidentally trashing them.<br />
<br />
Q: Can I stop my auction or receive a refund after it was purchased (for gold or real money)?<br />
A: All transactions are considered final and auctions cannot be cancelled, so make sure you’re certain you want to proceed before listing or buying a Token. To help prevent unintentional transactions, you will be prompted to confirm your purchase or sale before it’s finalized.<br />
<br />
Q: Is there a deposit? Does the Auction House take a cut of the Token seller’s gold?<br />
A: There’s no deposit, and the Auction House does not take a cut of the gold for WoW Token sales. The standard deposit is designed to dissuade players from spamming the auction house with items that aren’t selling, and the standard cut is designed to dissuade players from buying and reselling items for minuscule markups. These issues don’t apply to the WoW Token, so there’s no need for a deposit or cut.<br />
<br />
Q: Will each game region have its own WoW Token exchange? Will everyone in a game region have access to it?<br />
A: Each game region—Americas (including ANZ realms), Europe, Taiwan, Korea, and China—will have its own shared WoW Token exchange. We’ll share additional details at a later date.</div></div><hr />

The price will change, but it will be subject to Blizzards algorithm, not to people constantly undercutting each other.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Notorious</div><div class="date">2015-03-02, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So... is the game creating gold out of thin air? Sorry if I don't quite get it. It works on a first come, first serve basis, so the price dynamically changes; but the price can go down to the buyer and you'll still receive more gold then what the buyer might buy it for?<br />
<br />
Seems so. I'd like 20 tokens please, pronto, gametime running out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so in other words, it's a guarantee you get gold for the token you purchased? thats a relief atleast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do know that for every person who buys a token another person will not be buying a months subscription? If Blizzard makes money off this, it will not be in &quot;huge&quot; quantities. It's basically shifting the payment of your sub from you to someone else.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkminaz</div><div class="date">2015-03-02, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so 10-13k for 30days? (would be the &quot;current&quot; 3rd party price for gold), asuming 30 days will be half of the price of a gamecard. i.e 27 euro - 13.50<br />
kind of wonder how it will turn out, if i look at how the market is on my server they might not even give that much (most things are really cheap fast, gems drop from 3k down to 1k within 1 day.<br />
<br />
then again, might use those piles of gold for something useful.<br />
<br />
edit: didn't read propperly, so blizzard decides the gold price, well i sure hope they get the prices right. hardly see anyone using it if the won't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you put it on the auction it will stay there and say something like &quot;when this token sells you will receive 15600 gold for it&quot;. Unless everyone on the entire server stops buying tokens, yours will eventually reach the front of the queue and be sold, giving you the exact amount of gold you were told you would get.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">potis</div><div class="date">2015-03-02, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The price should follow the gold market the gold selling sites have to counter them.<br />
<br />
I recall seeing 15$ for 25K a few weeks back when i checked the price/ratio of gold in servers to as this token would be.<br />
<br />
So it should be somewhere in the 20-30K market hopefully, but knowing Blizzard, first token 100K here it comes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormdash</div><div class="date">2015-03-02, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Genuinely confused on something -- if Blizzard is setting this up to determine on their end what the &quot;correct&quot; value of gold to game time is, if they are taking that out of the hands of the player economy...<br />

High demand and low supply, the price rises, low demand and high supply the price falls. It will largely be determined by what they set as the base value, which I imagine to be somewhere similar to current gold seller costs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">potis</div><div class="date">2015-03-02, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its just a way to counter gold selling.<br />
<br />
Now instead of going to some weird shady site with a chance to get keylogged also, or idiots using same credentials to log onto both sites/games getting hacked right after.<br />
<br />
You want gold? Buy a token, wait a few hours/days depending on demand, and there it is!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormdash</div><div class="date">2015-03-02, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A guildie pointed out the answer to my own question is, by not selling the gold directly they aren't increasing the gold supply. But it's also not meant to operate as a gold sink, or they could sell game time from an NPC. So this is explicitly to 'spread the wealth around' in an in game economy. Ironically, by leveraging the differences in actual money in the real world.</div></div><hr />

Diablo ptr is up, with heroes beta, I don't think 6.2 ptr will be up very soon, expect this tier to last another 3-4 months.<br />

So 6.2 ptr in a 1.5 months ish.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tumaras</div><div class="date">2015-03-02, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People defend Blizz pretty vehemently on here no matter what they do without thinking for themselves, but this is opening the door to P2W and F2P any way you cut it. If you can buy gold with real money, and you can buy items with that gold that are better than what most people have then who's to stop a rich kid from dropping $1000 on gold and then getting a set of heroic raid gear? That's pretty much the definition of p2w, just slightly indirect and not selling items directly off the Blizz store. But it's the same result, just an extra stop at the AH. The other downside of this is it is a huge incentive to Blizz to further increase gold sinks in the game (like heirlooms were cough cough) in order to drive their own wowtoken (gold) sales, as an indirect cash grab.<br />
<br />
That said, #1 I'm not sure how much gear matters anymore anyway when you can get heroic raid gear from a garrison mission without even stepping foot outside your garrison. And #2, I do understand the argument that people already *could* buy gold for years if they wanted to deal with the shady sellers. But this is a whole different ball of wax. The vast majority of players wouldn't risk dealing with shady third-party gold sellers. So this changes things significantly when 100% of the players can buy gold direct from Blizz legitimately. For those reasons I'm more worried about the items mentioned above in the previous paragraph, especially the last point on increasing gold sinks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razamith</div><div class="date">2015-03-02, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest concern is tremendous demand with little supply. For someone to real money buy and put up a token it means they have to be involved in the game enough to need 20k gold or whatever current price is, but not enough that they already have 20k gold from the myriad of ways to easily get gold ingame, and have a spare $15. Demand will be through the roof as everyone has the gold to waste &amp; want to save real money. I dont see how either the Bliz algorithm either wont generate a tremendously high gold buyout (think 100k+) or supply wont be abysmally low. Remember its NOT bliz putting up the tokens, its someone who bought a token FROM bliz.</div></div><hr />

... why not just sell us the gold directly themselves?<br />
<br />
If they sold gold directly it would just add more gold into the server economy, cause inflation, and would necessitate that Blizzard add more and larger gold sinks to then remove the gold again.<br />
This method creates an incentive for rich players to redistribute their gold to other players.</div></div><hr />

Well, aside from the FACT that the gold is not being sold by Blizzard, but by other players on the server. All it is actually doing is shuffling gold around on the server between different people.</div></div><hr />

If Blizz is controlling the price of the 30 days token on the AH, what if it is really cheap like 5k gold for 30 days? Or it doesn't matter to Blizz if people will pay gold or pay money. I know if it is this cheap I would buy a years worth and not have to spend my RL money on it.

<br />
Yes, they are setting the &quot;market&quot; price.<br />
<br />
However, they will need to keep it cheaper than buying gold from 3rd parties otherwise it won't work as well, even if it's illegal<br />
<br />
for example, let's say it's 30,000 gold for 30 days game time, 1000/day<br />
<br />
Now lets say I can get 30,000 gold for $12<br />
<br />
That's still cheaper than the normal $15/month game time so lots of people would just do that to save the $$ and take their chances.<br />
<br />

Yeah, that is exactly what I'm worried about. Being able to just come back for a month and burn some gold on it is cool, but if I'm forced to pay for a month first so that I can have AH access... bit of a dealbreaker.<br />

No problem buying sub time for gold, infact its a good idea. It's the buying gold for real money that fucks things up especially in a subscription based game. They almost have all the features of a f2p game now but with a subscription on top, they have no shame what so ever.<br />

<br />
Not necessarily, though. Person A who bought it for real money, transferred it through the system to person B for gold - person B may have never paid for a subscription at all, if gold wasn't an option. So they are potentially making more subscription money in the end off of people whom paying real money was undesirable. But allowing a gold transfer to give another player the ability to pay for your game time, opens up a whole new option for some people.<br />
<br />
That said I don't think it's some dirty scheme by Blizzard to suck money out of anyone as many people seem to be inclined to think, I think it's perfectly reasonable.</div></div><hr />

I don't think gold sellers can really game this system.<br />

Blizzard has been pretty clear that they set the price. They claim it's based on several factors but in the end, if it is cheaper for people to just go to a gold seller site - they will.<br />
<br />
If it's cheaper to go buy 20k gold for $10 from a gold seller - then only fanboys are going to pay Blizzard for a token when it's only bringing 15k gold for $14.99.</div></div><hr />

What a farcical bunch of nonsense. What Blizzard is doing is letting you buy gold - its just that while you pay Blizz, the gold comes from other players in the game. They probably hope they won't blow their economy this way, but, when combined with how much gold can get you in-game, its still Pay To Win. Especially because higher-end raiders will pay for their subs via carries, everything in the game is going to become Pay To Win. Need a full set of Mythic Gear? That'll be $750 please. Pretending otherwise is just willful ignorance.<br />

They claim it's based on several factors but in the end, if it is cheaper for people to just go to a gold seller site - they will.<br />
<br />
If it's cheaper to go buy 20k gold for $10 from a gold seller - then only fanboys are going to pay Blizzard for a token when it's only bringing 15k gold for $14.99.<br />
<br />
I know a number of people who plan on selling tokens and buying tokens for gold, and none of them have ever expressed desire to use gold sellers.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention the risks you don't have when buying from Blizzard.<br />
<br />
There is a risk that your token will not sell in a timely matter.<br />
<br />
Right now, a player can choose to take the risk of buying gold from a gold seller and almost immediately receive your in-game gold. I personally do not buy gold but I know of some that do/have.<br />
<br />
With Blizzard's system, you buy a token. You list the token for current rate and it's locked in; however, your token may sell immediately or it may not. It may not sell until tomorrow or three weeks from now. You do not &quot;nearly immediately&quot; receive the gold.<br />
<br />
There will be people caught up in that aspect. Some will decide they want the gold immediately - even if it isn't as good of a deal and still go to the gold seller.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps I used the wrong label.<br />

I meant that there are people that would use a Blizzard sanctioned system even if it was absurdly overpriced. Fanboys probably doesn't really fit that - I apologize.<br />
<br />
The rest of the playerbase will have plenty of people that will scoff at either the exchange rate or the turnaround time and just continue using the &quot;illegal&quot; gold seller sites.<br />
<br />
What I've wondered about over the years is how many of those &quot;illegal&quot; gold seller sites are actually funded/owned under the table by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We'll here is the flip side to your argument.<br />
<br />
Over the past 9 or so years of my wow time, I've known a number of gamers to buy gold from 3rd party sites. Not a single one has ever been banned or had their accounts compromised.<br />
<br />
If the market for the token doesn't stay near the cost of gold selling sites. It would be easier to just buy gold from a 3rd party site and buy the token for that gold, if it saves you money.<br />
<br />
I've got no doubt there have been accounts compromised with gold selling but I also know accounts are compromised and have nothing to do with buying gold. So, I'm not entirely sold on blizzards excuse on don't use a 3rd party site because &quot;there bad&quot;.<br />
<br />
They have to keep token prices competitive with gold selling sites or else you could play wow for cheaper then normal.</div></div><hr />

This is pure conjecture and doomsaying. Nothing indicates that players will start demanding real money for in game services. In fact, that would still be against the ToS.<br />
<br />
If someone really wants to spend 750 on gametime tokens and buy a mythic carry with the resulting gold then so be it. Doesnt really matter to much. People who dont deserve gear mounts and titles have been buying their way since at least Wrath anyways. It even happens all the time in real life. Oh youre a rich millionaire who has never played a game of baseball before in your life? Come down the stadium and practice with the team for a week!<br />

<br />
There are already sites that sell carries for gear, so you literally make 0 sens.e This system isn't letting you buy gold and Blizzard still gets their money. No matter what happens somebody has to pay Blizzard for the token. They can sell it to 1 person and it become Soulbound to that person, they aren't even allowed to delete the item. I don't see how this system is a big deal, there is no way it'll hurt the economy or anything. Prices will be enormously high at the beginning and then balance out to about a set price as no one is going to take a hit from their RL money. I get the feeling, that it'll have a nice market for it, but it'll be highly stable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not up to you. The general perception of gold selling sites is that they are shady, I'd rather cut my card up than put my details into a gold selling website, and *most* people will not touch gold selling sites with a 20 yard barge stick. If this reduces just 1 person from going to a gold selling site it's a success. That's 1 less person who might have their card details stolen and 1 less hacker/botter that will get paid for their activities, but the fact is that not just 1 person will use this, there will be millions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">banur</div><div class="date">2015-03-02, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, so a few of those QA peices:<br />
<br />
Q: What happens if the price quoted to me is different from what the Token actually sells for?<br />
A: You will always receive the gold amount quoted to you at the time you place a Token up for sale, regardless of what the current price is when the item actually sells.<br />
<br />
So... is the game creating gold out of thin air? Sorry if I don't quite get it. It works on a first come, first serve basis, so the price dynamically changes; but the price can go down to the buyer and you'll still receive more gold then what the buyer might buy it for?<br />
<br />
Not necessarily as they don't state the sale price will be the buy price. I could very well imagine a similar AH cut as for all other auctions or even more. So they would be destroying gold.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd have preferred that they award battle.net balance, so I could make some server transfers/race changes for gold, but I guess the money saved on subscription fees can be put to such use.<br />
The last thing Blizz wants is to lose money. Those tokens need to be bought by someone in the first place.<br />
<br />
<br />
whats the point of it instead just adding option to buy gold in in game shop<br />
The huge difference is Blizz selling gold or the players exchanging gold.<br />
<br />
<br />
so basically blizz is selling gold for real money, at least the tokens become soulbound so it wont benefit ah bots<br />
No Blizz is NOT selling gold (creating it out of thin air), only existing gold will exchange hands. Bots can still benefit due to &quot;free&quot; gametime while selling gold cheaper than Blizz.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you put it on the auction it will stay there and say something like &quot;when this token sells you will receive 15600 gold for it&quot;. Unless everyone on the entire server stops buying tokens, yours will eventually reach the front of the queue and be sold, giving you the exact amount of gold you were told you would get.<br />
I would imagine the algorithm puts the most expensive tokens first to get them out of the system. It is even possible that gold is divided with a system to pay for a couple of posted tokens and then delay the payout.<br />
All of this is possible since I imagine you won't see the names of seller or buyer.<br />
<br />
<br />
But it's also not meant to operate as a gold sink<br />
We don't know the system which could include an AH &quot;cut&quot;. Basically the token which will give you 95% as final payout while selling at 100%.<br />
<br />
<br />
People defend Blizz pretty vehemently on here no matter what they do without thinking for themselves, but this is opening the door to P2W and F2P any way you cut it. If you can buy gold with real money, and you can buy items with that gold that are better than what most people have then who's to stop a rich kid from dropping $1000 on gold and then getting a set of heroic raid gear? That's pretty much the definition of p2w, just slightly indirect and not selling items directly off the Blizz store. But it's the same result, just an extra stop at the AH. The other downside of this is it is a huge incentive to Blizz to further increase gold sinks in the game (like heirlooms were cough cough) in order to drive their own wowtoken (gold) sales, as an indirect cash grab.<br />
Yes it will possibly inflate prices for high end goods.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would ask people to not put these on the AH for stupidly high prices. I am one of the players who can not afford gametime so this will be my only way of getting it. Thank you.<br />
You have no control over the price, Blizz will give you a quote.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember its NOT bliz putting up the tokens, its someone who bought a token FROM bliz.<br />
We don't even know that. I imagine the tab to be a button to purchase a token for X gold or to post a token for Y gold. No names no nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
We don't get to set the price and it becomes soulbound? Way to take any possible fun out of it Blizz.<br />
No it is a clever system to prevent tokens from becoming a currency.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm all for this. But I just don't get why we are not allowed to sell them for whatever we want, to re-list (or speculate with) bought tokens.<br />
Being able to trade tokens would mean that you can sell all other stuff directly for tokens, making gold useless.</div></div><hr />

Currently:<br />
<br />
Player A pays $15 to play.<br />
Player B pays $15 to play.<br />
<br />
Then:<br />
<br />
Player A pays $30 to play and get some gold.<br />
Player B pays some gold to play.<br />
<br />
No additional real money has been paid to Blizz.<br />
<br />
You can count on the fact that the Token will be bought more often than being used. There will be tokens sitting in people accounts that just stopped playing. Remember, once you buy the token with gold, and you decide to stop playing, there's a good reason to sell it back (because gold is meaningless if you stopped playing). So in the long run, Blizzard is winning, and not only because it allows people with financial issues to play.<br />
<br />
Also, this will allow alot of kids to play this game, like, their parents who control wether or not they pay for the subscription no longer have control over the account of their kids. The kid will jsut farm gold and buy time.</div></div><hr />

Blizz will make money when player A buys the token for $15 and stops Player B from paying the bulk membership rate of $13/month. <br />
Blizz will make money if the token is more than $15. And I expect it to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check gold buying websites I guess, whatever $15 buys you from illegal farmers would likely equate to what these tokens will cost. I don't condone gold buying from third party sites but in this instance just for the sake of comparison i've gone and checked one: These tokens will sell for 20,000-25,000g a piece, which is reasonable when you consider its someones hard earned cash that's bought said token.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Over the past 9 or so years of my wow time, I've known a number of gamers to buy gold from 3rd party sites. Not a single one has ever been banned or had their accounts compromised.<br />
<br />
If the market for the token doesn't stay near the cost of gold selling sites. It would be easier to just buy gold from a 3rd party site and buy the token for that gold, if it saves you money.<br />
<br />
I've got no doubt there have been accounts compromised with gold selling but I also know accounts are compromised and have nothing to do with buying gold. So, I'm not entirely sold on blizzards excuse on don't use a 3rd party site because &quot;there bad&quot;.<br />
<br />
They have to keep token prices competitive with gold selling sites or else you could play wow for cheaper then normal.<br />
<br />
You are extremely naive if you believe the impact of compromised accounts by gold selling is minimal. Account compromise is a big issue for Blizzard and is why they go through such lengths to promote and provide authenticator and encourage account safety. Do you know the majority reason why accounts are compromised? For GOLD SELLERS. Besides the fringe hackers who do it for fun or to flat out steal an account, the vast majority of compromises are done with the purpose of selling all the gear, using a bot to farm herbs and ore, and transferring the gold to another account. Why? So they can sell it for real money. I would be willing to bet that most of the gold that is purchased through 3rd party sites is stolen gold. At the very least it was obtained through means that are against the TOS and often implemented on characters that do not belong to the gold sellers.<br />
<br />
If gold sellers can no longer make a sustainable profit from selling gold than the number of account compromises would drop to almost zero.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quras</div><div class="date">2015-03-02, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not up to you. The general perception of gold selling sites is that they are shady, I'd rather cut my card up than put my details into a gold selling website, and *most* people will not touch gold selling sites with a 20 yard barge stick. If this reduces just 1 person from going to a gold selling site it's a success. That's 1 less person who might have their card details stolen and 1 less hacker/botter that will get paid for their activities, but the fact is that not just 1 person will use this, there will be millions.<br />
<br />
It's not up to me or you or blizzard on what people do.<br />
<br />
Gold selling sites are not still around because there failing. Hell, I've know enough people to to put money on throw away credit cards and bought gold over 9 year and nothing has ever happened to them. <br />
<br />
So no, I'm not sold on blizzard trumped up excuse. Thats not to mean it cannot happen but really, gamers accounts are compromised all the time and have nothing to do with buying gold.<br />
<br />
If blizzard can't keep a competitive rate on tokens to where gold is being sold from, it has the potential to drive people to 3rd party sites to save money on their sub. Like I said, those 3rd party sites are not in business because their failing or because their consistently hacking others accounts. Happy customers come back.</div></div><hr />

Achievements can already be bought for gold and have been bought for gold since they were first implemented.

You are arguing apples to oranges here. Gametime is a system that merely gives you access to the game. It doesnt give you gear, and simply having gold doesnt give you BiS or access to easily complete achievements. <br />
<br />
Buying gold with gametime is a way to cut out the dangerous middle man. Buying gametime for gold is a way to give those with extra gold a second way to play the game. Neither advances your character in any way and neither gives you access to content you otherwise wouldn't be able to do.</div></div><hr />

It does have a impact on the game, anything boa can be bought for rl cash (including gear) that's quite a big impact if you ask me.

That and this sounds exactly like what Arena Net does with gems...you can bet there is a hefty backend gold exchange fee that acts as a gold sink + insurance against supply / demand changes. The gem conversion is GW2 has about a ~ 30% sink or so.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Player A pays $20 for one game token that they &quot;sell&quot; on the exchange for 21,000 gold<br />
Player B pays 30,000 gold on the exchange for one game time token, the price set by Blizzard<br />
<br />
without player A and B knowing it, a 30% exchange cut was taken out.</div></div><hr />

Farm some gold and pay your sub. Blizz have calculated they will make more money selling tokens than subs.<br />

You're neatly leaving out the bit where the guy selling the gametime ends up with gold in their pocket, which they can then use to buy goods and services in-game, dependent only on their ability to turn real-life $$$ into gold.

There may be more players that farm gold, hoping to find a token to buy. While this is legitimately created gold by killing NPCs with real players (not bots), it's still gold that would not have been created with no token to available to buy.</div></div><hr />

I never get this logic, at least they get a cut.

Not a fan of Blizzard taking complete control of this. Unless I am missing something, think they should just take their cash for selling it and let us AH it like we want to.<br />
<br />
If they do, they run the risk of steep undercuts making the price plummet and dealing with players crying their $15 game token only got them 1,000 gold. They need to be able to ensure auction goblins don't do things to drive the price down. I can see why players can't set the price because they don't want people manipulating the market.</div></div><hr />

It's the buying gold for real money that fucks things up especially in a subscription based game. They almost have all the features of a f2p game now but with a subscription on top, they have no shame what so ever.<br />
<br />
Every Boe equipment, mount, pet etc etc is now essentially available for real life money, when those level 700 ilvl epix appear in the next content patch odds are there will be BoE items available that will be transferred for cash its ridiculous.<br />
<br />
right but I still do not see how this affects you?<br />
<br />
If I give my 10 yr old son 1,000,000 gold and he buys every piece of high level gear he can, how does that hurt you?<br />
<br />
If it was PVP gear he's still terrible at playing, if it's PVE gear, he couldn't move out of fire if his life depended on it so no raid would take him.<br />

And it gives Blizzard a shed load more revenue - more revenue = more staff = faster content/expansions, don't complain.<br />
<br />
More money for less work, that doesn't mean they will turn around and use that new money on the game. Look at the game now they are making more money now then ever before with the mixture of high subs and a cash shop and we have shit for content and they are planning on having people buy another expansion even sooner then before. So as of right now we pay more for expansions then before, subs are as high as they have been in almost 5 years, the cash shop is making buckets of money and we will be buying new higher priced expansions sooner then before. There goes your little model of income vs outcome.</div></div><hr />

Except that u aren't buying from Blizzard, minting new gold coins. You are buying coins from other players that have earned them during play. After the transaction, you have more and they have less. The other way, you would just have more.</div></div><hr />

Both have no gold. Both are new players. One, because he is poor has to level up his character then spend months gearing it up. The other who is rich can buy a level 90 boost then buy mythic gear.

For some transactions, but it should average out if blizzard does it right since it can happen in reverse too.<br />
<br />
After Player C's purchase, the supply goes down and the market price goes back up to 20k. Player D buys a token for 20k, and Player B gets paid 19k</div></div><hr />

I buy a Token. Current market tells me i will sell it for 20k. Next guy buys a Token and market tells him he get 19k for it. Then a Player can buy a Token for 20k or 19k?<br />
<br />
You get 20K, the &quot;Next guy&quot; pays 19K.<br />
<br />
The way it probably works is that the game will set a base price, then if the number of available tokens to buy gets low, the market price will go up, if the number of available tokens gets too high then the price goes down.<br />
<br />
E.g. lets say Blizzards starts the price at 50K gold with 100 tokens as the ideal supply.<br />
1. For the first hour you can put tokens up to sell, but can't buy any.<br />
3. People are now buying and selling at 50K<br />
4. 50K was a lowball figure, only 80 tokens are up for sale after the first hour, and the supply is decreasing<br />
5. The price goes up to 60K, more people want to sell, less want to buy.<br />
6. Now it is at 100 tokens waiting to sell and is pretty stable.<br />
7. People start getting their tax refunds, and start trying to sell more tokens.<br />
8. Supply goes up to 120 and is increasing<br />
9. Price falls back down to 50K.<br />
10. People have spent thier refund, so the price now goes back up to 60K.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like you've probably gotten time to read by now, we won't determine price directly on these while listing them.<br />
<br />
Second off, we're talking real money here. They will likely cost a fair bit to buy off the AH. No one is in the business of simply sponsoring your subscription.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IxilaFA</div><div class="date">2015-03-02, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're neatly leaving out the bit where the guy selling the gametime ends up with gold in their pocket, which they can then use to buy goods and services in-game, dependent only on their ability to turn real-life $$$ into gold. It's literally Pay to Win. Judging by the fact that so many people don't be able to see past the obfuscation Blizzard stuck in the middle of the transaction, they were definitely clever to have done it this way.<br />
More gold does not always equal a statistical advantage. You can already buy carries and gold for real life money through shady means. Nobody has ever considered a BOE or a carry through Mythic as achieving any sort of success in this game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still not bad though is it, 665 gear and boosted character on top of that, it's a slippy sloap they started with paid mounts and its slowly starting to filter into the game play, more stuff will be available for money soon enough there's no end to Blizzards greed thats been proven over previous years.<br />
If you want to be fully decked out in BOE epics then I guess that's cool for you. Very few people would consider that you have achieved anything, which is the very definition of pay to win. <br />
<br />
Also you realize the slippery slope is a fallacious argument right? Blizzard introduced mounts and pets in the shop like six years ago and we still have not seen a statistical in game advantage for sale yet.<br />
<br />
It's still pay to win. You're using your credit card to buy mythic gear off the auction house. Which gives you an advantage over someone who doesn't have enough money irl. It's the entire fucking definition.<br />
It only gives you an advantage over someone with neither the money IRL or someone with no gold. Because for what 50k gold you can buy a mythic piece off the AH. How hard is it to make 50k gold? Besides there are other sources of gear outside the AH. Someone can get mythic gear in caches without ever killing a mythic boss. You can get 680 essentially for free by crafting your own gear.<br />
<br />
If a person having a mythic belt and mythic necklace with every other piece being a 665 and you consider that &quot;winning&quot; in WoW then so be it.<br />
<br />
You are not buying an advantage in game that couldn't be easily accessed otherwise. Its a lot like the lv90 boost...getting to lv90 took minimal effort beforehand and spending 60 bucks to skip the process isnt giving you any significant advantage.</div></div><hr />

Would be much, much, much safer to just allow the seller to name their price, and if it sells, it sells.<br />

Better still would be the above, plus allow buyers to list buy orders and name their price too .. but that would be more work, whereas a straight sale listing wouldn't be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because that's an idiotic idea if you want to combat the illegal gold market like this (and yes that's why it's introduced). <br />
<br />
With them setting the price depending on Demand and offer, means that gold sellers have to go below a point where it's still profitable for them to keep doing it as a job. If they like not set a fixed but constantly calculated price point it would end up being more profitable for gold sellers at some point, which would be silly.</div></div><hr />

It does have a impact on the game, anything boa can be bought for rl cash (including gear) that's quite a big impact if you ask me. I could boost a character to 90 and then buy all the best BoE items available (after leveling to 100) all for the price of real life cash its the exact meaning of pay to win, all right the boe's at the moment aren't exactly great but they are good enough and the impact will get worse with every content patch (guessing next content will have some 700 ilvl BoE items)<br />

<br />
By that logic we should also get rid of friends lists and grouping with friends. Because someone who starts playing and has a friend who is in a mythic raiding guild that runs him through all of the leveling dungeons, crafts him 680 gear and then takes him on mythic clears also has a significant advantage.<br />
<br />

One, because he is poor has to level up his character then spend months gearing it up. The other who is rich can buy a level 90 boost then buy mythic gear. Pay to win means people with money having an advantage over people that don't. I don't know how to say this any simpler.<br />
<br />
You are twisting the words of the person you were arguing about to make a completely separate comparison.<br />
The person who buys the tokens has enough gold to buy advantages, maybe they even bought those and are using the gold to buy game-time after this. The point is that advantages already exist for those who play the AH and spend a lot of time making gold.<br />
<br />
In fact, you could say there was a disproportionate advantage given to those who can spend more time in-game getting gold to those who spent more time working. I think that's fair enough, since those people put more time into the game but if we're talking general equality for all, it's not like there's no advantage now.<br />
<br />
It's simple:<br />
If you're successful in-game with gold, you can buy game-time and gear. You work for that gold, you reap those rewards.<br />
If you're successful in your career, you can get gold and reap the same rewards by trading with players who have that commodity.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either money to spare or gold to throw away(like me), you'll have to find gear and success in a different way. Personally, this change will do nothing for me cause I don't have enough of either, but this isn't pay to win.<br />
Pay to win is when you only have real life money to get ahead in-game. Right now, you can work and get everything without it even without gold. In fact, you can't even buy a whole heroic set with all the gold in the world and mythic is only off-pieces.<br />
<br />
You've got to give something to get the rewards. Real money is one of those things now, but it's not the only thing and it's not even the best thing (since it's more limited). Hence, it isn't pay to win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to think this way, but over time I've changed my stance. Yes, it is paying for an advantage over someone else (time.) The thing is, Blizzard is not selling a direct advantage (which would be literally generating gear and selling it.) The items you can buy with gold are PLAYER CREATED. What I mean by that is someone crafted/got as BoE drop/boost player through raid/dungeon for a drop etc. The gold is being used to buy things created in the game by players, not out of thin air by Blizzard. The gold is being used to trade for these items... and someone else in game can get these exact same items by playing the game itself and earning gold to buy them - it just takes more time.<br />
<br />
I've learned to just kick back, not worry about what other people do, and enjoy the game with my &quot;free&quot; gametime/items/etc (like being able to pay for gametime with gold.) In other words, there is an advantage on both sides of the coin - learn to accept and enjoy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IxilaFA</div><div class="date">2015-03-02, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the misunderstanding in this thread comes from everyones individual definition of pay to win. Pay to win is attaining a statistical advantage in game via means that are either difficult or impossible to achieve besides paying money. I have the following examples:<br />
<br />
1) Blizzard introduces a potion in game that increases the damage and healing you do by 5% for 1 hour. This potion rarely drops off raid bosses. Additionally you can purchase it on their store for 3.99 per stack. Since the item is rare and difficult to attain in game, this is pretty severe pay to win.<br />
<br />
2) Blizzard introduces the same potion from example 1, but instead of only dropping off bosses it can be made by alchemists for some harder to obtain mats. The result is theres a decent amount available for sale. Optionally you can spend none in the store to buy these potions. This is not really pay to win because anyone in game who spends the smallest amount of effort could also get the potion.<br />
<br />
3) Blizzard introduces an alternate currency in game. This currency can be obtained by completing a daily mission in your garrison for five of these tokens. You can buy really good gear and enchants and gems with this currency as well, but it costs like 50 tokens per piece of gear. Additionally you can buy 10 tokens off the in game store for 5 bucks. This is almost 100% pay to win because it guarantees that someone with more real life money will maintain an indefinite edge over someone trying to do things the free way.<br />
<br />
As it stands, buying gold neither nets the buyer a statistical advantage that is difficult to obtain in game, nor does it grant them access to items that others cannot get. At the very worst its a mild form of pay to win, if your idea of winning is acquiring some pieces of BOE gear and buying a title and a carry that you dont deserve.</div></div><hr />

I've had guildmates who are in countries where the economy is trash/no money who would miss a raid unless someone helped them out and gave them gametime from a card, and ofc they'd thank you with gold. That's all this system is. <br />

When arguing about pay to win, you are in essence arguing about a statistical advantage that one has in the game over another by way of real currency. Thus one can equally argue that having a good community of friends also offers you a statistical advantage, which according to you should never be allowed. So we should get rid of friends in WOW too, right?<br />
<br />
And just so you know, there are other advantages in game that one can obtain without just being good at the game. Having more time to play, having better access to more resources outside the game, etc, all give you an advantage over other players. You ask why its fair that someone with more money IRL should be given a slight advantage. I ask why is it fair that someone who can play all day everyday should be given a slight advantage?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slicer299</div><div class="date">2015-03-02, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thoughts on this from someone who was initially against the idea when Blizzard mentioned they were thinking about it a couple of months ago.<br />
<br />
Why Blizzard is doing this. Because players have asked for it. Because its successful in other MMOs. Because they want to do more to combat against gold sellers.<br />
<br />
While Blizzard make money off of this. Yes, but not in the way some people are claiming. People are not paying twice for the same sub, but this will allow players who struggle to pay the $15 a month for whatever reason to either continue or renew their sub. This benefits not only Blizzard but the players as well since the larger the player base the better it is for everyone. Also, Blizzard spends a ton of money paying employees to assist players in recovering compromised accounts. The number one source for compromised accounts are gold seller who seek out those accounts to compromise in order to both farm gold and trade gold to the players they have sold that gold to. <br />
<br />
Why the pricing system will &quot;make gold out of thin air&quot;. Guess what, all in game gold is made out of thin air. Its not a tangible item that exists in the real world. The pricing system Blizzard has disclosed is designed some very critical issue that they simply can not leave to the whims and wills of the players, or the AH bots that are so often run by those same gold sellers. The real money price of the item has to be set so as to not make it a better dollar value than a regular sub, but at the same time needs to be priced likely with some sort of premium attached to make a regular sub more attractive to players since its the payment model that Blizzard prefers players use. <br />
<br />
On the in game side they need to keep the gold price reasonable so that players will even consider both buying and selling the item. It can't be too high or too low for either player. They also want to keep the gold price set so as to undermine the gold sellers, since making their business less profitable is the only thing that will help shut them down. But they don't want the sellers to ever be penalized to where they end up getting less gold than the item was originally listed for. So while that may &quot;create gold out of thin air&quot; the exact opposite will also happen. When you list the token but the selling price goes up, you don't get that extra gold, so that extra gold that the buyer pays will be removed from the economy entirely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or the price will go down. I see what you're saying though, the person buying with money has the advantage here, but you also have to consider that the money they are holding in the form of a token is not being used to buy other things and resell, making cash that way instead. <br />
<br />
I hadn't considered the buy for a friend thing, that would be kinda cool. Got a lot of WoW gold and can give gametime to a friend as a gift. They are kinda missing out on that possibility.</div></div><hr />

Wait, what do you mean?, This has to happen with the token coming out. That is why people are flipping their shit basically.<br />

Unless your hoping for them to be super expensive, it will mostly likely be regualted by Blizzard &amp; they could be cheap the more people who buy them more subs &amp; more money.</div></div><hr />

It opens the market up for the full WoW player base though, that can't be said for the illegal gold selling sites.It's almost certain that more gold will be bought with rl money when these changes come into effect than they do at the moment by paying for a dodgy service.</div></div><hr />

I see what you're saying though, the person buying with money has the advantage here, but you also have to consider that the money they are holding in the form of a token is not being used to buy other things and resell, making cash that way instead. <br />
<br />
I hadn't considered the buy for a friend thing, that would be kinda cool. Got a lot of WoW gold and can give gametime to a friend as a gift. They are kinda missing out on that possibility.<br />
<br />
Why can't you send him the gold you would use to buy the game time?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeuhe4yxzhds</div><div class="date">2015-03-02, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thoughts on this from someone who was initially against the idea when Blizzard mentioned they were thinking about it a couple of months ago.<br />
<br />
Why Blizzard is doing this. Because players have asked for it. Because its successful in other MMOs. Because they want to do more to combat against gold sellers.<br />
<br />
While Blizzard make money off of this. Yes, but not in the way some people are claiming. People are not paying twice for the same sub, but this will allow players who struggle to pay the $15 a month for whatever reason to either continue or renew their sub. This benefits not only Blizzard but the players as well since the larger the player base the better it is for everyone. Also, Blizzard spends a ton of money paying employees to assist players in recovering compromised accounts. The number one source for compromised accounts are gold seller who seek out those accounts to compromise in order to both farm gold and trade gold to the players they have sold that gold to. <br />
<br />
Why the pricing system will &quot;make gold out of thin air&quot;. Guess what, all in game gold is made out of thin air. Its not a tangible item that exists in the real world. The pricing system Blizzard has disclosed is designed some very critical issue that they simply can not leave to the whims and wills of the players, or the AH bots that are so often run by those same gold sellers. The real money price of the item has to be set so as to not make it a better dollar value than a regular sub, but at the same time needs to be priced likely with some sort of premium attached to make a regular sub more attractive to players since its the payment model that Blizzard prefers players use. <br />
<br />
On the in game side they need to keep the gold price reasonable so that players will even consider both buying and selling the item. It can't be too high or too low for either player. They also want to keep the gold price set so as to undermine the gold sellers, since making their business less profitable is the only thing that will help shut them down. But they don't want the sellers to ever be penalized to where they end up getting less gold than the item was originally listed for. So while that may &quot;create gold out of thin air&quot; the exact opposite will also happen. When you list the token but the selling price goes up, you don't get that extra gold, so that extra gold that the buyer pays will be removed from the economy entirely.<br />
<br />
What the fuck am i reading? Gold is not made out of thin air,. it does require work. Have even played the game?</div></div><hr />

Or will they need to bum a trial off a GM if one isn't in their account management? [They've been known to provide 24 hour trials]<br />
<br />
Ok...looked it up:<br />
<br />

<br />
So I guess you need to open a ticket for a free trial or something. GMs might provide them normally or something I'd think now for short periods of time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ringpriest</div><div class="date">2015-03-02, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the misunderstanding in this thread comes from everyones individual definition of pay to win. Pay to win is attaining a statistical advantage in game via means that are either difficult or impossible to achieve besides paying money. I have the following examples:<br />
<br />
1) Blizzard introduces a potion in game that increases the damage and healing you do by 5% for 1 hour. This potion rarely drops off raid bosses. Additionally you can purchase it on their store for 3.99 per stack. Since the item is rare and difficult to attain in game, this is pretty severe pay to win.<br />
<br /> 
2) Blizzard introduces the same potion from example 1, but instead of only dropping off bosses it can be made by alchemists for some harder to obtain mats. The result is theres a decent amount available for sale. Optionally you can spend none in the store to buy these potions. This is not really pay to win because anyone in game who spends the smallest amount of effort could also get the potion.<br />
<br />
3) Blizzard introduces an alternate currency in game. This currency can be obtained by completing a daily mission in your garrison for five of these tokens. You can buy really good gear and enchants and gems with this currency as well, but it costs like 50 tokens per piece of gear. Additionally you can buy 10 tokens off the in game store for 5 bucks. This is almost 100% pay to win because it guarantees that someone with more real life money will maintain an indefinite edge over someone trying to do things the free way.<br />
<br />
As it stands, buying gold neither nets the buyer a statistical advantage that is difficult to obtain in game, nor does it grant them access to items that others cannot get. At the very worst its a mild form of pay to win, if your idea of winning is acquiring some pieces of BOE gear and buying a title and a carry that you dont deserve.<br />
<br />
<br />
They could launch &quot;pay $5 to instantly kill the player or boss you're currently fighting&quot; and some Blizzard apologist would still come up with a justification for how it wasn't really Pay 2 Win.<br />
<br />
If you want to play a Pay 2 Win game, you're certainly free to do so - please just stop pretending it isn't one.</div></div><hr />

Damn, this game has fallen from grace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
... why not just sell us the gold directly themselves?<br />
<br />
Simplest reason why they are doing it this way.<br />
They are not adding extra gold to the economy.<br />
<br />
If they sold gold directly it would effect the value of gold and inflation.<br />
Whereas if they use the way they are, the same amount of gold will be in the playerbase.</div></div><hr />
