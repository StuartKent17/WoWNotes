Blue Tweets<br />
Racials<br />
really disappointing and quite telling that imbalances are left in for the same of something as silly as faction balance<br />
If there were no racials, Humans would still be by far the most popular class on the Alliance. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443802815874351104))<br />

Snake Trap is really only used for Entrapment anyway<br />
Nope.I use it every fight for the various poisons it does especially the all important slow poison.<br />
Do you really need two different traps to slow enemies? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444189559933255680))<br />
<br />
No scatter shot is not gone.We tried traps activating instantly.Warriors still will charge over them.<br />
Warriors will not charge over traps. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444189293364248577))<br />
You promise?Because right now Ive seen hundreds of players just cruise right over them.Even in direct los.<br />
They're made with different tech now. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444192467991031809))<br />

Since Fire scales much better then all other specs, devs had to nerf it every major patch to get it back in line<br />
It doesn't necessarily have to scale better than other specs. We have one change coming that helps prop it up at early gear levels. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444562149747064832))<br />

Hoping for an answer. I &lt;3 Arc Torrent on my healadin for the mana return. Still happen in WoD? Or all pally specs getting HP?<br />
All Paladins get Holy Power instead of Mana. Holy Power will be more valuable, though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443579008668536833))<br />
No more mana for paladins, inc holy? Very big change! Moving MW to energy also? Or did I read too much into that?<br />
You misread. This is talking about Arcane Torrent, the Blood Elf Racial. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443583033057091584))<br />
Sir celestalon, will it still do aoe silence or will it just be a resource gain?<br />
Still does that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443604208126656513))<br />
<br />
Anyway you could talk about design philosophy when approaching Retribution in WoD?<br />
Anything in particular? Generally planning polish and tuning, but no major revision. Happy with Ret design, minus a couple tweaks. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444972067423657984))<br />

rogues are very dependant of crit, any buff for them in wod?<br />
It's folly to ask for buffs when fixating on one specific change without considering all of the other changes coming. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443556328678518785))<br />
<br />
Is paralytic poison gone, or did it go baseline?<br />
It is gone in Warlords. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443801809631465472))<br />

Any plans on taking a look at Windfury Weapon in WoD? lots of us feel it's lost it's wow factor (scuse the pun) in recent expacs<br />
We're investigating whether we can take the cooldown off it (but still not proc off itself). No promises though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444974047613304832))<br />

so will u also make arcane torrent more valuabke to warlocks? Mana useless, need either burning ember soul shard or demonic fury<br />
A whole soul shard is too much, which is a problem. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444204241448484864))<br />
whats about other specs. Half a burning ember or 100 demonic fury doesnt seem like a problem<br />
Problem is consistency. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444204747109572608))<br />
but u can see how mana is useless for lock? Love belfs but turn between changing race :-S trolls an orcs look more appealing<br />
BElf still gives 1% Crit, so not useless. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444206300566544384))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Also, with valor/justice gone, what's going to be the carrot to get people to complete groups in WoD?<br />
We'll have more info in weeks ahead, but we agree it's important that people are incentivized to not bail mid-run. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/444252558794584064))<br />
<br />
cata healing changes. with all the changes happening with healing, is SoO going to be reduced burst damage output? cont<br />
SoO will be adjusted to suit any class changes. It won't be more difficult in 6.0. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443940861370318848))<br />
<br />
in 6.0 will SoO go to the new raiding system? Norm and Hero flex specifically<br />
Yes, it will. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/444695183209140224))<br />
<br />
What's the word on Mythic trash? I feel it would add a lot of immersion to the dungeons. Still have nightmares of AQ trash.<br />
No more dynamic difficulty swapping means that raids will have Mythic trash. And yes, that means Mythic trash loot. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439085907967111168))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
running dungeons then converting JP to honor is faster than queueing bgs... can u fix that<br />
We did one wave of buffs to honor rate. We may do another based on what we see. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443551299053707264))<br />
<br />
By 'mean' you mean 'poorly designed,' right?<br />
World PvP is deliberately unstructured &amp; emergent. If you want a fair fight, we have instances (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/444877255756365824))<br />
<br />
With the expansion coming on december and the season ending in 20 weeks what are we going to do during this big gap without arenas?<br />
We have made no announcement about when the season will end or when the game will be released. You're making bad assumptions. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443195572413952000))<br />
I was just assuming the worst case scenario. Should we expect a 30+ weeks season, like s11?<br />
sorry, we don't comment/speculate on the length of a season. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443403195369263104))<br />
<br />
How does the team feel about the new arena ladder? I kinda miss teams because I liked starting fresh on a new charter. What's yours<br />
We're quite happy with the change. In general it feels like an improvement. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443431600571686913))<br />
<br />
World<br />

I've seen that extremely rarely, and always found that flying away and coming back solved it. Sorry! (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443183790366543872))<br />
We cant fly in warlord's how do we solve issues like this.<br />
A) We don't intend to have bugs like that. B) I just said 'fly' as that's what's common now. 'Ride' does the same thing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443263887119380480))<br />

Is this guy on crack!? Maybe smoking to much weed? Has he been in a random bg in the past 8 years? Because its the same cluster fuck for the past 8 years. The Q system is totally fucked.

loot 2.0 is great but you can play reg d3 and get those benefits and also the updated paragon level stuff. You pay $40 for act 5/ crusader class/ adventure mode/transmogy/ enchant/ and those rift things<br />

Im right there with you. I felt ripped off after buying DiabloIII. I didnt realize the entire game was beatable in a few hours and then you just did the same thing over and over endlessly with meager loot rewards. I stopped playing about 2 weeks after launch and never played it again. The good part is I made most my purchase money back in the $$$ AH. Terrible game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It followed the franchise's play/difficulty system perfectly, it was always a game you beat within a few hours but then you spent months and years perfecting characters. I think lots of people bought the hype but never played the previous games to understand what they were buying. D2 was a game that made even more demands with regards to loot, but you advanced through trading and not the AH.</div></div><hr />

First off, obviously redesigned map... looks almost nothing like Outland. Second off, where the hell are you getting &quot;less content than MoP&quot;? Anything they've said so far regarding content mentions stuff in the initial patch/exp, nothing mentioning anything in future content patches... hell, the stuff announced so far for launch is more plentiful than most of the expansions we've seen, and there's still stuff that hasn't been fully discussed yet.<br />

We're getting TWO RAIDS at launch, apparently (Second one to be gated and not available till later)... at least, according to some posts I've seen people make.

You're right, I should go apply for a job at blizzard so that I can fix the fucked up Q system that they cannot figure out because they are inept dumbfucks 8 years running. While there I will also make pvp balanced where its 1 v 1 like everyone in the FUCKING world expects in a fucking game. Love it when it takes 5 people to kill one healer 5 min. Thats great balance, or for that matter when a fucking feral druid with 1300k health /90% damage mitigation is up for 10 min with 5 dps on him.... thats GREAT balance(thats sarcasm, sad that I have to state it).<br />
<br />
Look 27 million people ditched this game because of fucking crap like this or similar. If blizzard can't hire people that can fucking do their job properly then blizzard should be purchased by another software company and or dissolved. PVP fucking sucks and the comment this dickhead made about how instanced pvp is balanced just shows his incompetence. BGs are instances! 3v3 is just one instance which very fucking few people play vs the masses. <br />
<br />
Way to go blizzard! keep balancing around an instance that your pvp dev loves but few play. You hired the right guy and team.</div></div><hr />

Totes. The excuse of &quot;but Diablo 2 was the same way&quot; is legit because it totally wasn't 10 years after they should of learned their lessons and made a better game.<br />
<br />
No matter how it's spun, Diablo 3 was inexcusable and finished Blizzard as brand in the hearts of many. They didn't take any of the lessons they learned in their previous games and released something that had barely more gameplay than most phone games. They didn't take what they learned about the lootsystem or any of the improvements LoD made over Diablo 2. Instead, they just shit all over their franchise</div></div><hr />

Also, less dungeons. Only 3 while leveling from 90 to 100. Then 3 for max level. You may call Outland redesigned but I'll call it for what it is, rehashed crap that is not worth the $49.99. Redesigning the entire vanilla word was barely passable. Now we are getting even less and paying for more. I haven't even touched on what kind of mindless daily grind the garrisons will be if you like to play alts.</div></div><hr />
