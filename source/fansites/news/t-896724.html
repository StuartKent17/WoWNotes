Blue Posts<br />
Dungeon Finder and players from the same realm<br />
That isn't just a coincidence. Many players have stated since the release of the Dungeon Finder that they like the convenience of being matched for a group automatically, but they miss the feeling of community when they're paired with strangers from other realms with whom they might never speak again. So we made a slight change in the way the Dungeon Finder sorts through the queue matching players for a dungeon.<br />
<br />
This was a late addition to the patch notes made yesterday evening:<br />
<br />
The Dungeon Finder will attempt to place players from the same realm in a party together. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/172611/in-realm-pugs-only))<br />
<br />
&quot;Just&quot; 7 bosses? Firelands isn't Trial of the Crusader<br />
This ain't Trial of the Crusader. The place is epic and there's a ton of progression and fun to be had in 4.2. The actual boss mechanics are pretty incredible, and there are a few surprises players can stumble across in the raid as well!<br />
<br />
7 is just a number... I'd bet 4 to 7 of my toes this will not even be a topic of discussion come release of the patch. It's one of those random things people latch onto when they only have so much information, only to be distracted by something else random to take issue with the next day/week/month. <br />
<br />
[...] I actually enjoyed raiding ToC, but we'll certainly admit it wasn't the most epic tier of raiding we've released. ;)<br />
<br />
We tried out a very different format for that raid. I think it suited its purpose well, but it's not a shocker that it's not a player favorite, or the most memorable raid. There's something to be said about working through an expansive dungeon with crazy trash pulls and amazing environments.<br />
<br />
Oh man... I can't wait for you to get into Firelands! I've been given a tour of the place from our encounter design team on more than one occasion. It's friggin' epic. Serious. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/172610/all-of-this-hate-over-7-bosses))<br />
<br />
Authenticator field removed from the main login screen<br />
The authenticator prompt is indeed no longer on the main login screen, and this was an intentional change to prepare for future authentication functionality. Rest assured your account is still protected. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/172481/authenticator-field-gone))<br />

But u can't form guilds with players from other realms, this helps build a community to see who u want to play with in a guild based on personality/skills/whatever.<br />

I could see 10 bosses being awesome sauce, but 7 bosses just isn't that much... You can't have every boss be super hard and you can't have every boss be lootbags, some halfway point needs to be reached, and I don't see that happening with just 7 bosses. <br />
<br />
At the same time, I know blizzard is pretty awesome and maybe I can suspend my disbelieve long enough to see it for myself. I'm guessing the massive QQ waves will persuade me in the wrong direction before that time happens tho.</div></div><hr />

How do you know it won't be epic? does more bosses mean more epicness? if blizzard made a raid with only deathwing as a boss.... would that take away the epic feeling of beating him?</div></div><hr />

How do you know it won't be epic?<br />
<br />
When you have more bosses, its progress leading up to the end boss.<br />
<br />
does more bosses mean more epicness?<br />
<br />
See above.<br />
<br />
If blizzard made a raid with only deathwing as a boss.... would that take away the epic feeling of beating him?<br />
<br />
Yes, because the kill would feel less substantial, no matter how hard the boss was.<br />
<br />
TL,DR: Blizz is slacking on raid content</div></div><hr />

Nope, there was never any confusion. This has been explained over and over agin, even braindead monkeys should understand it by now. Way to waste precious interview time.</div></div><hr />

At the moment I am still enjoying the current raid (4/6 at BWD, atra and nef left, 2/4 at BoT and 1/2 at Tot4W) and my group is still slowly progressing.<br />
<br />
Imo the content besides the raid is alot. The quest zone seems really large and I hope the new Thrall quest line will be long too. As a hunter the new legendary staff doesnt really bother me as I cant use it, so that is too bad for me (I wish they made it so that you could let the staff evolve in a weapon that is useable for your role or class).<br />
<br />
Sounds like a really fun patch to me and looking at the time between 4.1 preview and 4.1 release, this should only be 2 months away from us :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want more raids and patches faster, you can't have 14 bosses... only a few will do all of them in such short time. 14 is good for 8 months or more... 7 is a good number for less than 6 months of lifetime for raids.</div></div><hr />

I noticed it too this &quot;Ghostcrawler&quot; that is apparently added to the game in 4.2 seems to be a much more crazy than Ragnaros himself or the demon to his left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Greg: I don't think they're harder than ever.. the Firelands bosses are about on par with what we've done in Bastion of Twilight or Blackwing Descent.<br />
<br />
games.on.net: So there's no amazingly new steep level curve to deal with?<br />
<br />
Greg: Shouldn't be, although the heroic mode of Ragnaros is going to pretty epic. That's going to be a real challenge for players. Except for that fight, they should be able to do everything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
so... if thats true 7 isn't really enough, only heroic Ragnaros will be more harder, probably the same dificulty of heroic LK versus the others HC</div></div><hr />

Not sure i'm happy with the lfd change. Seeing as its been one of the worst progression servers since vanilla, i really would rather not have a chance to get grouped with them. Since the change its gone from having smooth runs with random server groups to wiping 5+ times in any given random.</div></div><hr />

That basically means that this shit's going to be over so soon that the 'epicness' won't be lasting more than a couple of months. Good job Blizzard, on confirming our worst fears.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morsetlis</div><div class="date">2011-05-02, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There should be a &quot;smooth run&quot; checkbox that only ilevel 353+ people can check to queue with only ilevel 353+ people. After healing ZG for a group with 9k, 8k, and 7k dps and then doing it again, as dps with 19k, 18k, and 17k dps (with only 5% buff), you can really feel the difference. What's the difference? You can zerg Zanzil and Bloodlord with heroism while ignoring adds, and Jin'do doesn't feel like trying to chew barbed wire for 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
While I don't like some of the retards on my server, it actually has quite a few good guilds, so I prefer this change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ulduar had many variations on a broader theme going (ie. madness) which allowed more variety, but FL is just all fire; we don't need another Molten Core.<br />
<br />
7 is plenty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
But I don't want to form guilds with other players. If I'm in a dungeon its because blizzard are forcing me or to see it (once) - the quicker its over the better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said that you will be getting 365's from the new daily vendors so i beleive it will be 365/379 and probably between 385-390 for Rag heroic loot.</div></div><hr />

Pretty cool seeing 1/2 the raid DC all night and wiping to farm content.<br />
<br />
This exactly.<br />
<br />
This week, it's taken us 3 nights of raiding to do the hard modes we used to do in one night. Having your tanks and healers consistently DC at crucial parts of the fights, over and over again, is pretty horrible. This patch has been worse than most for client instability.</div></div><hr />

Actually the DC's were caused by addons mostly.<br />
<br />
Tell your healers to stop being shitty and stop using recount.</div></div><hr />

This B-team just keeps getting worse.<br />

Really, you went there?<br />
<br />
You do realise your pretty much proving the point right</div></div><hr />

Muradin should have been there (or Jaina/Sylvanas w/e) and yet we got a guy who was introduced (widely, I know he was in the game beforehand) for the most part in that same expansion. Just felt kind of cheap.<br />

<br />
Can't wait to do the Thrall chain!</div></div><hr />
