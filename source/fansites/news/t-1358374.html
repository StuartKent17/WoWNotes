WoW Source: Patch 5.4 Developer Round Table<br />
Blizzard released a video that gives an overview of Patch 5.4 and then answers some of your questions (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/268538-looking-for-your-questions/).<br />
<br />
<br />
Over 50% of Flex Raids last week had 2 or more raid sizes, so people are really making use of the flexible size feature.<br />
Roughly the same amount of people did a flex raid last week as the number that did scenarios. <br />
The Timeless Isle is somewhat of a template for endgame world content going forward. There might be some more structure in the future, but the general style of content that avoids pure daily quests worked well. <br />
Adding things in the world to discover while leveling will also be a goal moving forward.<br />
As far as storage space goes, choosing what to keep is part of the gameplay. No matter how much bag space players are given, it will always end up being full.<br />
Heirlooms are taking up a lot of space, so a centralized storage like the one used for pets and mounts is being worked on. The toy items added in Mists of Pandaria also take up a lot of space, so a similar solution for that would also be ideal.<br />
Siege of Orgrimmar is one of the more melee friendly raid zones that have been added recently. The devs are looking for things melee players can excel at or perks they can have without taking tools away from ranged players.<br />
The Gnome race didn't exist when the original WoW cinematic was being worked on, which is why they didn't appear in it. There hasn't been a good opportunity to showcase gnomes in a cinematic since then.<br />
Patch 5.4.1 will add a new Refer a Friend system. The whole process will be moved in game, rather than requiring you to visit the site in your browser. The system will give you a token which you can redeem for the new mount, one of the other mounts, or a pet.<br />
Blizzcon will have &quot;an exciting glimpse into the future of WoW&quot;, as well as a live raid.<br />
<br />

Rated Battleground Ratings Adjustments<br />
As you may be aware, we recently made a change to Rated Battleground queues that makes players wait until the match has ended to queue for a new Rated Battleground, even if they had left that match. This change allowed us to close a loophole some were using to artificially inflate their ratings, but unfortunately quite a bit of abuse had already occurred by the time we implemented the fix. Our goal now is to restore as much integrity to the Rated Battleground ladders as possible, and we’ll be doing that in two key ways.<br />
<br />
During our next maintenance we’ll be lowering all Rated Battleground personal and matchmaking ratings for those above 2200 down to 2200. The abuse was widespread to a point that many legitimate players’ ratings have been inflated just because they’ve played against those who had used the loophole to boost their rating, and so we need to get everyone back to some equal footing. But secondly we’ll be taking action against the accounts for those who knowingly and purposely abused the exploit to boost their rating, which will result in more than just their rating being reduced.<br />
<br />
We’ll be keeping a close eye on things, and looking to take swift action for any further issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Crowd Chose You Buff<br />
We're not really happy with how The Crowd Chose You is working out at the moment. We're exploring a few options for exactly what we'd like to do, but we will be changing it.<br />
<br />
what's the PTR for?<br />
I also totally get the concern that these sorts of changes should be happening on PTR and not live. In an ideal world, they would be. Thing is, the PTR is such a different environment, especially for PvP, that we really don't see the same sort of player behaviors on the test realms that we do on live. There's a lot fewer players, and those that do test aren't worried about getting high ratings as much as they are just trying out new changes.<br />
<br />
That makes sense, and we don't really expect players to behave any differently than they do. It just means that, sometimes, issues that crop up on PTR don't extend to live. In this case, we saw the issues cropping up on PTR, but there was a reasonable case to be made that those behaviors wouldn't work on a live environment, where players would care more about their ratings, or the higher pool of players would mean those tactics weren't as successful as often. So, we decided to give The Crowd Chose You a shot, while also starting to think about what we could do if the issues persisted. <br />
<br />
In hindsight, sure, it would have been better if we'd done something else to begin with, instead of making the change a couple weeks into the PvP season. Ultimately, we made a bad call, which is why we're working to make some changes now. Just be aware that making those calls isn't as simple as looking at how things are on the PTR. It can be pretty difficult to decide who to listen to sometimes. <br />

Soul Link + Unending Resolve glyph.<br />
There's a huge difference between giving up major defensive cooldowns for a passive effect and just having a passive effect on top of everything else. <br />
<br />
In the case the OP laid out, the Warlock is effectively sacrificing two major cooldowns: Unending Resolve, and either Demonic Sacrifice or Dark Bargain. That's a pretty hefty price to pay, and though it certainly seems to be a popular choice at the moment (and we can discuss whether or not it's too strong), it's still a choice. We like choices. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/273891-soul-link-unending-resolve-glyph/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10160426698?page=2#25))<br />
<br />
Warcraft Story<br />
My point is that I feel like for WoW to get exciting again we need a new storyline, new heroes and new villians that we can all love and hate. <br />
This is not the first time I have been reading a comment like this, and it is one that I personally find to very interesting due to the vastness that is the Warcraft lore... There are so many different storylines in the Warcraft universe, some obviously more known than others, but which ones would be the most interesting ones for the future?<br />
<br />
It could be cool if you guys would share some specifics on what you have in mind when you say that you want a new storyline... are you talking about a continuation of existing storylines, or a restart of the Warcraft storyline overall? Also, do you have a particular storyline you would find more interesting than others? <br />
<br />
Some people have already answered questions like these in the story forum, sometimes quite extensively, but in this thread I think a few lines will suffice.

Seems like they're patting themselves on the back for Flex and Timeless Isle, but I think they did this a month too early, but then again, Blizzcon is next month. Flex and Isle were definitely a success on my high pop, not sure about the Censure aspect though. The low 1-3% drop rates and 100k coin grind are definitely keeping players engaged. Plus it's an insanely easy way to get charms. First Ship and Maw of the day gives me over 30 charms.<br />

It is an odd statement indeed. My guild struggles if we bring more then one melee - and usually we prefer to have none at all.<br />
<br />
Let's look at each of the fights:<br />
<br />
Immersius - melee struggle to spread out enough to avoid the whirlpools, and avoiding swirl is much more difficult.<br />
Protectors - other then the mind sear spell, its not too bad.<br />
Norushan - so much AoE damage killing the big adds.<br />
Sha of Pride - makes prisons awkward, not to mention having to run off to kill the big add.<br />
Galakaras - fine for most of the fight, but right at the end it SUCKS for melee who have to run through the raid to spread out the fireball damage.<br />
Iron Juggernaut - huge pain in the ass when being chased by bore mines, huge dps loss during seige pulse.<br />
Dark Shaman - massive liability when the oozes spawn.<br />
Nazgrim - having to run around after adds, one of which whirlwinds your face off? Not fun.<br />
Malkorok - due to his tiny hitbox, melee are hopeless for helping absorb the void zones. And then stacking in front of the boss = getting parried loads. Urgh.<br />
Spoils - prone to sudden deaths due to AoE. Massive dps loss when dropping bombs.<br />
Thok - excellent if you can prolong phase one for ages. Utter joke in phase two, unless you're really living on the edge and just praying you're not next on the target list.<br />
Blackfuse - might be okay on this fight. But I imagine they suck on the assembly line.<br />
Paragons - no thanks.<br />
Garrosh - won't be able to kill corrupted weapons at all. Or engineers. Shaman will require lots of running around. Overall horrible.<br />
<br />
There's not one situation where I'd willingly take a melee over a ranged. Not one. And that sucks.<br />
<br />
Bosses need larger hit boxes for non-tanks (might be complicated to program) or melee needs a little extra 'range' to do their attacks (even if its an extra yard that would solve many issues).</div></div><hr />

They better not fucking make the Zhevra available again.<br />
And I really don't like how there may be an option to choose either a mount OR a pet from RAF.<br />
<br />
Depending on the reward, I usually end up buying another WoW account and referring it so I can get the rewards, but I'd really hate to have to do it twice if I like both whatever the mount and pet are. <br />

Can't agree in the slightest. It has a shelf life of maybe a month and then there's absolutely no reason to go back. No story progression that has any real meaning or variety. It's like being trapped in a single zone in GW2. Forever.</div></div><hr />

That said, in our raids we just let the melee sit on bosses most of the time, while ranged takes care of the problems at hand, doesn't work all of the time and melee must run an help, but most of the time it's fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's look at each of the fights:<br />
<br />
Immersius - melee struggle to spread out enough to avoid the whirlpools, and avoiding swirl is much more difficult.<br />
Protectors - other then the mind sear spell, its not too bad.<br />
Norushan - so much AoE damage killing the big adds.<br />
Sha of Pride - makes prisons awkward, not to mention having to run off to kill the big add.<br />
Galakaras - fine for most of the fight, but right at the end it SUCKS for melee who have to run through the raid to spread out the fireball damage.<br />
Iron Juggernaut - huge pain in the ass when being chased by bore mines, huge dps loss during seige pulse.<br />
Dark Shaman - massive liability when the oozes spawn.<br />
Nazgrim - having to run around after adds, one of which whirlwinds your face off? Not fun.<br />
Malkorok - due to his tiny hitbox, melee are hopeless for helping absorb the void zones. And then stacking in front of the boss = getting parried loads. Urgh.<br />
Spoils - prone to sudden deaths due to AoE. Massive dps loss when dropping bombs.<br />
Thok - excellent if you can prolong phase one for ages. Utter joke in phase two, unless you're really living on the edge and just praying you're not next on the target list.<br />
Blackfuse - might be okay on this fight. But I imagine they suck on the assembly line.<br />
Paragons - no thanks.<br />
Garrosh - won't be able to kill corrupted weapons at all. Or engineers. Shaman will require lots of running around. Overall horrible.<br />
<br />
There's not one situation where I'd willingly take a melee over a ranged. Not one. And that sucks.<br />
<br />
Bosses need larger hit boxes for non-tanks (might be complicated to program) or melee needs a little extra 'range' to do their attacks (even if its an extra yard that would solve many issues).<br />
<br />
Dunno what you understand by &quot;melee frendy&quot; , it doesnt mean that as melee you jsut tuneol boss and dont care about anything SoO is better raid for melee thaen preavious but tis not perfect , presonal done 10/14 HC(10) with 3 melee in group so dont see your problem</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well done. You'd probably be more progressed with less melee.<br />
<br />
Which is the point, not that its IMPOSSIBLE but that you're handicapping yourself by taking melee DPS. The only real benefits they have over casters is slightly better armour and avoidance - and so few fights benefit from that. Infact the only ones that do are fights like Dark Animus or when bosses do large amounts of unavoidable physical damage like Morchok.<br />
<br />
If you're going to argue that, then I have nothing else to say.<br />

Getting timed exclusive mounts isn't aspiring to something though, is it? Its being fortunate enough to get something while its available that required zero effort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope they are kidding. I much more prefer 5.1 daily-lore-style patch then timeless-boredom isle. Instead of any lore (why is Emperor spirit there? Why does he hate Yungol? Who is Ordos anyway? - yes, I can read about it on wowpedia, etc, but there should be lore in-game) they presented us with hours of brainless grind with one-shoting mobs. <br />
<br />
I admit, I was not a great fan of Isle of Thunder dailies or Dominance Offensive ones but I much more preferred to do them then to kill the same mobs over and over and over again for countless of hours for no particular reason other then that they give &quot;rep&quot; with Yungol hating old emperor ghost.<br />
<br />
I mean, I prefer actual content then sandbox zone where your only goal is to kill anything in sight. <br />
<br />
Once I'm done with emperor rep I will never go back there ever again. Simply because the boredom beats other (non-raid wise) mop patches ten times or even more. I really hope they'll rethink their statement.</div></div><hr />

But there are so many abilities that will just one shot us for simply being in melee range or severely disrupt our ability to do damage.<br />
<br />
First 4 bosses arent to bad. Theres nothing that really gimps us to bad. Target switching and the constant moving on protectors can be a bit tiresome but overall its not a huge deal and the add on Sha I just ignore all together.<br />
<br />
Galakras, watch them cleaves, sometimes can be hard to see with all the ground effects. Target of fireball will often render you useless. Small hitbox is fun.<br />
<br />
Dark Shaman - GTFO. I got asked why I cant just run forward with the tanks during Toxic Stream by our raid leader last week. I wanted to put my face into the desk.<br />
<br />
Nazgrim - Ill just run over to this add, then try and run back to the banner then run back to this add, then run back oh theres a shaman, Ill just oh I cant do anything cause theres a guy whirlwinding on the boss, great.<br />

Malkorok - I love getting yelled at for not getting a ball thirty thousand yards away due to the tiny as fuck hitbox.<br />

<br />
They could tie them in more than just flying around clicking a scroll in XYZ, either way, I want more &quot;story time&quot;, a lot of room to extend and improve on that next xpac.<br />
<br />
Also, a carbon copy of Timeless isle would suck, they need to add SOME daily quests in that area in my opinion, it's easy anyway and they know it, just don't make them a requirement. I also kind of like adding new factions to areas like that if they give awesome rewards, a lot of people don't like grinds, but when done right it's not too bad, just make the rewards worth it, and the time to get exalted reasonable, cosmetic items, pets and mounts are best from factions, not gear, then it doesn't make them seem like a requirement either.<br />
<br />
I'm not putting what I'd like it to be, I'm putting it how I think they'd get least complaints, I sort of like a grind now and again, as long as it's worth it, relevant, and interesting.<br />

<br />
Lets see what you did wrong.<br />
<br />
Immersius - Melee doesnt need to strugle about anything, boss has a huge hitbox and you can drop puddles so close you will never run out of space. For range it can get harder when boss is low on HP since it takes time to cast spells. Killing adds is EZ<br />
Protectors - Melee/ranged friendly fight.<br />
Norushan - nothing wrong with this fight.<br />
Sha of Pride - Melee doesnt need to run and kill the big add, range can do that, one prison can be done by tanks so its EZ fight<br />
Galakaras - So running a bit is hard? Have you played this game before MoP?.<br />
Iron Juggernaut - So? Again bit of running is hard? You can place the boss so that the pule doesnt throw you so much....<br />
Dark Shaman - The boss that spawns the oozes stands still, one tank can move the other boss and be save, There are a lot off CC that you can do to them and they will die in 4-5sec or less.<br />
Nazgrim - So? running to kill an add is hard. I bet you enjoy Patchwerk like fights....<br />
Malkorok - There is no need for melee to absorb them at all, You have ranged + healers that are spread out...<br />
Spoils - AoE death never happened, if you have problem you are not killing the right ones. Bombs are not the issue, you can remove them in few sec So no, not at all a massive dps loss.<br />
Thok - For melee EZ fight during standing phase due to non being interrupted, littile running is hard? Also there is an add you can help get killed<br />
Blackfuse - Line isnt a problem at all, and tbh i love the fight. one of the easiest fights in SoO....<br />
Paragons - 2 boring, but not that hard if you have a decent group....<br />
Garrosh - Any caster can kill the engineer, im soloing them as moonkin in 2-3sec or less ( 10man ), rogues can kill them, hunters can kill them... Shamans are not the problem if they get hit by wheel. Fun fight and moderate hard...<br />
<br />

I liked that you could get those lesser charms quickly by simply killing mobs.<br />
<br />
Sadly, it wasn't like that at MoP release and that nearly made me gouge my eye out.<br />
<br />
Problem was that you could only get from dailies + you needed a stupid amount of them (90).<br />
<br />
Now you can get a lot from just killing (or doing pet dailies wich gives you way more than normal dailies) and also only need 50.<br />
<br />
If we just needed 50 at MoP release, they wouldn't need to put it on mob loot.<br />

In the odd chance that she does, could you please tell her that it's very rude to constantly interrupt the developers during the interview?<br />

I'm not watching the video to hear her voice, I want to know what the DEVs have to say, so tell her to shut up and let the other guy express his thoughts!<br />

<br />
Go throw a bunch of melee no Thok and see your raid DPS diving...<br />
<br />
Really, it's not hard to understand that. It's melee &quot;friendly&quot;, but not optimal.<br />
<br />
You would prefer to take a ranged DPS over melee DPS for most fights. Why would you think that's better to take a melee for Thok for example?<br />
<br />
The tank itself can basicaly kill the add. Rangeds can even remove the enrage from him while quickly dpsing it and changing back to Thok.<br />
<br />
Ok, some melee can disarm the mob, yay great! No go chase the big boss that moves faster than you and you have a high chance of being one-shoted by him while doing laughable dps trying to not get killed. Lol.<br />
<br />
Dark Clusterfuck Shamans... not even comment.<br />
<br />
Funny fact, running around trying to dps something is the only time I probably see my melee character while in &quot;action&quot;. Other than that is just a ranged spelleffect showdown... lol.<br />
<br />
And ppl claiming that &quot;melee used to do that before, you know&quot; should remember that ranged dps also had to run a lot (and couldn't keep dpsing the boss since most of a caster dps was... lol, casting) and bosses used to try to kill ranged players at the same time they tried to kill melee players.<br />
<br />
Now Blizz solution is to remove melee from possible targets of boss abilities... instead of a better balanced design + removing the spelleffect clustercrap so melee can actually be required to see something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also can't understand why Blizzard just don't copy what other games do for storage problem.<br />
<br />
SWTOR for instance, you have a tab in you bag for quest itens. They also don't throw a bunch of vanity itens like Blizzard did in MoP anyways. They &quot;heirloom&quot; goes to a kind of BoA catalog where you just select the piece of gear and copy it to your bag to use. After you don't need it anymore, you just delete it, but it will stay there in the catalog if you need (just do the same thing again, select and you'll receive a BoP copy of it in your bag). When you buy a heirloom, you're just unlocking it on your colection catalog for your account. Done.</div></div><hr />

Dps will dive only during &quot;chase&quot; phsee. Do you think I like it when his interrupts are so fast i can only cast an instant cast spell like MF or SF. Yey simply amazing. Melee can dps him duging chase phase without any problem, only on last &quot;chase&quot; run when he get really fast they should be away from it.. And still he goes down fast...<br />
Yes tank can kill the add on 10man fast, on 25man he cant... But melee can still dps boss....<br />
<br />
Thok is only one boss with that mechanic. Immerseus is standing still, Protectors, you only need to keep Rook not facing the raid ( melee ) and its EZ, Sha, omg i need to go and free ppl in prison? How is that against melee? General, omg i need to help on adds, why oh why do i need to do that, when i can just stand still and dps boss. Norushan, oh i need to help on adds, again I cant just dps the boss...And so on....<br />
<br />
Shamans? Ok lets see about ranged point of view. Omg I need to move from shit on the ground, omg i need to dps the adds, omg I need to CC the adds so they dont hit melee, omg I need to watch out from Meteor or what ever it is, omg I need to move from &quot; tornado &quot;. Melee just needs to follow tank, and tanks job is not to move boss in the wrong direction. Hell I OS as guardian and I tanked it, as &quot;melee&quot; i didnt found any issue with it....<br />
<br />
Not on any normal fight melee has to move in order to kill add. Garrosh 1st phase is melee friendly, you only need to watch and dont get hit by the wheel. range can kill the weapons, and you can aoe the adds like crazy. I should be crying that as ranged i need to run from side to side and kill engineer, losing like 25sec-30sec doing nothing.<br />
<br />
But no, what ppl fail to realize is that a guild run isn't, omg look at my high dps, its not meant do boost your low self esteem but hitting high dps and being 1st on WoL. Its about only one thing, killing the boss as a group of 10 or 25ppl. When ppl realize that it would make your life more EZ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you don't have devotion aura to keep you from being interrupted (at high stacks anyway, and you still have instant casts to use, the same way melees have high dmg spamable ranged skills and... oh wait...), but you stay way more in chase phase than that in terms of dps. So no, it's not optimal to bring melee to it. 25 is 25, you'll have melee anyways it's a lot of raid spots anyway, plenty of ranged to cover for loss of raid dps from melee.<br />
<br />
You can name plenty of problems for melee in fights, but can't name a lot of it for ranged... &quot;omg, at high stacks I can't cast my entire arsenal of spells, only the instant ones&quot;, but can unload on Thok &quot;like a boss&quot; while it runs, even when you're the one being chased, since he is far away from you alread &quot;Rá! eat my heroic throws Thok! hahaha!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Immersius is easy for melee&quot; and is also for ranged... see the pattern? There isn't a fight where you would prefer to bring the highest possible number of melee dpsers. It's not about changing a target in norushen, or removing someone from a prison in sha (how is that even a problem for ranged?). The fact is that there is nothing in the raid to shutdown a ranged dps as there is for melee. The simple fact that a spellcaster have the option to use instant casts for a still decent amount of dmg destroys it for melee. Melee do not have decent dmg ranged skills to cover for it like ranged does. Even a frost DK can't spam howling blast, altough it is a decent ranged dmg attack (for DW spec), it's just ONE spec from a melee class. If all melee classes/specs had a &quot;howling blast&quot;, we could work from there, but no.<br />
<br />
Remember when hunters used to have a minimum range? That could be the &quot;melee moment&quot; for them on fights like malkorok and other bosses that you need to stack in melee. But again, only one class would get it...<br />
<br />
See? Its about the best use for your dps raid spots, not &quot;ah, we can carry a melee&quot;. Can't deny this fact. Blizzard is talking about &quot;it's possible to do&quot;, &quot;in a certain moment you'll be able to carry a few more&quot;, etc... but I can also do that with my mage friend that does 100k or less dps, he's a bad player, but it's a really good friend that when we can, we carry him, so he can experience stuff, get a mount, etc.<br />
<br />
You even did &quot;my job&quot; by saying how stupid is to bring melee to dark shamans... you have the extra job to keep them safe because they just can't do it themselves since the adds will just blow them up. You have to put them chasing one of the bosses (hey, do you remember that their HP is shared, so a ranged can attack both at the same time while the melee can't unless you keep both stacked all the fight???? Much better for the entire raid...) while protecting them and doing better dps. It's not that they don't have to move to kill an add, you don't WANT them to move to do it and perform even worse (and you don't need to move from side to side to kill one engineer for Garrosh fight). You're saying it all out: &quot;MELEE SUCKS&quot;.<br />
<br />
And no, it's not about WoL, melee dps is part of your raid dps, you need all your dps perfoming well to bring that boss down. Worse on 10man. You can cut that slack in flex, but not in normal/heroic. That's the problem.</div></div><hr />

I get my low lasting uninterrupt form symb with lock.. But that has a long CD and it can be used 2 times or less depending how fast you are on killing the boss. Chase phase doesn't have to be long, if yo kill the add and free mobs in prison faster. If you look at the WoL you would notice that only few range classes are on top, same with melee so one can say its not desing for his class/spec...<br />
<br />
name few. So far only the Thok is an issue due to running. shamans are not the problem in any way since you move with tanks. There is no reason to push your dps and rick being killed because you wanna cleave both, 100% of the fight duration.<br />
<br />
Look at the WoL, its a mix of ranged/melee depending on a boss fight. And then you can also say, omg why is that lock doing 2x dps then my mage. So not fair...<br />
<br />
How can prisons be a prob. In 10man there are 2. One can be done with MT and OT without any problem and one closest to where the add spaws can be done with one melee who will have to move for like 1 sec and a you can even put a healer if he isnt inside prison. On 10man it takes 2-3sec or less to free person inside.... shouldnt take more then 3-4 in 25man considering you can use warlock portals..<br />
<br />
Yes and that is the reason why i never played hunter. But do you remember the time when range had to stand in order to cast spells? Oh we still do. Remember the time when ranged had to cancel casting in order to move from a puddle that just spawned under them, like on Immerseus, while melee can move and do same dmg?<br />
<br />
Adds dont need to reach any melee if the tank not tanking Shaman making them moves. Having 3 ranged ( hunter, moonkin and lock ) if they are grouped, adds will die in 4-5sec max. So there is no need to risk it and keep both Shamans so close, at least not on normal... They are not grouped only for few seconds during that time range is killing adds. When they are grouped melee can again just cleave and dps both...</div></div><hr />

Method had a WW monk on all their Heroic kills, and if not all certainly had him on Heroic Garrosh. <br />
<br />
I don't have much trouble on mine either, as SEF is pretty useful for a lot of fights. Naz I can attack the whirlwind guys, boss and attack a shaman myself. On Thok I can clone on the boss and attack jailors. We have rolls, Flying serpent kick and Trans to move around, good CD's to avoid damage, decent DPS, the only thing holding us back from being the top melee pick is no real raid utilities.</div></div><hr />

Melee friendly != you standing behind the boss and tunneling them.<br />

Exactly. Like the guy above who listed changing targets and AOE as mechanics that favored ranged.<br />
<br />
Dark Shaman are the only boss where I noticed a really annoying mechanism for melee. And how can you list Galak??? geez, the major boss mechanism basically forces you to stack in the tail of the boss and do nothing but DPS.<br />

I much more prefer 5.1 daily-lore-style patch then timeless-boredom isle. Instead of any lore (why is Emperor spirit there? Why does he hate Yungol? Who is Ordos anyway? - yes, I can read about it on wowpedia, etc, but there should be lore in-game) they presented us with hours of brainless grind with one-shoting mobs. <br />
<br />
I admit, I was not a great fan of Isle of Thunder dailies or Dominance Offensive ones but I much more preferred to do them then to kill the same mobs over and over and over again for countless of hours for no particular reason other then that they give &quot;rep&quot; with Yungol hating old emperor ghost.<br />
<br />
I mean, I prefer actual content then sandbox zone where your only goal is to kill anything in sight. <br />
<br />
Once I'm done with emperor rep I will never go back there ever again. Simply because the boredom beats other (non-raid wise) mop patches ten times or even more. I really hope they'll rethink their statement.<br />
<br />
One of the problem with the devs is they don´t take criticism well. This is definitely a case of them throwing out the baby with the bathwater. 5.0 dailies sucked.. but not really that.. Golden Lotus sucked.. Some of the others (CS, AC, Tillers) were fun. 5.1 dailies were fine. Thunder Isle dailies were fine. So basically the devs really screwed up a lot of little things with Golden Lotus.. there was a lot of negative feedback ( mainly about Golden Lotus)..and now their conclusiion is that playes hate any dailies.<br />
<br />
There are some cool things on Timeless island, but mostly it is just running in a big circle trying to catch rares as soon as they spawn. I think the 5.1 content was more fun overall. Instead of the devs just throwing away dailies, they should go back and really analyze all the little mistakes they made with Golden Lotus.. There are a bunch of little things that all contributed to the player outrage about dailies in 5.0 that could all be easily fixed. (and most were in 5.1 and later).</div></div><hr />

There was something kinda cool about having to earn your way up to raids and guilds that meant something. Casuals and noobs had tons of stuff to do. Solo players had lots of fun things to do. Blizz keeps desperately changing the game to get people to play but with every change you have to relearn the game and tons of people stop playing. They added more and more group activities that added way more waiting and queues to the game. After cata I found that spending half a day bouncing in circles waiting fro a group to orm was just a big waste of time. Asshats dont invite you to a group because your gear number is 3 points too low even though you have raided with top 10 worldwide guilds and can do 50k more dps than some tard that stands in fire, aggros packs and wipes a group 20 times because he cant figure out the boss mechanics, but thank god his gear level is 20 points higher than mine!!<br />
<br />
Just finished up a free 7day and it just solidified my hate of the game and how bad blizz fails. How clear of a failure is it that blizz makes a pvp island and all the bosses drop 95% pve gear!!! uh duh! 2 shot island just made 7 days of annoyance and all the &quot;please try all these new features&quot; was impossible to try because you cant grind out the gear level and etc in a week.<br />
<br />
I just want to love the game again. its just horrible now though. Back to all the free games.....<br />

We do heroics and this is where the melee vs ranged becomes more ugly. The fact is it takes more work for a healer when you have melee instead of ranged. Melee are high maintenance. Sure the fight can be done with melee, but it makes guilds want ranged more.</div></div><hr />

Definitely the &quot;toys&quot; are an issue primarily with being BoP. I would not be against Blizzard throwing in BoAs to the mix as part of their solution to bringing BoAs cross realm and might just be an overall better system than having to mail each item back and forth between realms and then trying to remember which toon on which server did you last leave the item on. Tabards could work with the system as well.</div></div><hr />

On many boss fights in SoO melee just needs to stand and watch out. But ppl are crying since then need to move on Shamans fight.... Why not make all bosses like a dummy and we win...<br />
<br />
Its not that we have to move at all, moving is fine, its the moving and standing there waiting with our fingers up our arses whilst the ranged can happily DPS away that is an issue. Its the fact in most cases its a liability to bring a melee. Less reaction time for melee, higher healing required in some instances. Times where we just cannot DPS the boss resulting in sometimes significant downtime. Easier to deal with some mechanics.<br />
<br />
9/10 Ranged DPS just do the job better. <br />
<br />
I would rather take a ranged DPS to Dark Shaman, Galakras, Seigecrafter, Nazgrim, Thok, Spoils and Klaxxi over a melee any day of the week. Everything about these fights favor ranged.</div></div><hr />

Melee aren't complaining that boss fights are too hard (although the total throw up of player/mob AoE ground effects are OUT OF CONTROL but thats another story). Melee want to be competitive right now I have a hell of a time finding pug flex raids because ranged are just more useful on most fights. To me we will be balanced when you can pick up 6 ranged OR 6 melee and nothing will change about the difficulty of the fight. They need to have mechanics that don't heavily impede melee (Thok phase 2) or at least have things equally impede both ranged and melee. The solution is not to exclude melee from mechanics.</div></div><hr />

Range also needs to move from s**t on the ground, if that is hard then the game probably isn't for some ppl. You do realize that while melee moves loss in dps isnt that big of a problem if the mobs/boss is in range, and on many fights he is ( other then Thok ), but while range moves ( hunters excluded ) our lose in dps is much higher? Why it is? Melee that dies from inc dmg on the ground, oozes... isn't a bad game design but lack of concentration and bad reflex? If you know you need to move, then move, don't w8 for the last sec.<br />
<br />
Spoils can be a ranged friendly fight, but how many melee does get hit by the adds and get stunned, how many lose dps when they need to move from them or to stand in Animus like beams? <br />
<br />
Galakras, more melee fight the ranged, tank grabs the mobs and you aoe them, only not ignoring the prio targets. When the boss lands if you need to move, wel tough luck, so does range...<br />
<br />
General Nazgrim, why? because you need to move and kill adds or from that jump ability ( cant remember the name )....<br />
<br />
Thok, you cant dps during chase, but during standing you can and you wont be interrupted....<br />
<br />
Shamans, you only need to watch for oozes, if te tanks are doing that job that is you only concern, while range has to move from tornados, meteors, oozes if they get aggro.... So much dps loss there. Yes locks are first there on dps meters, but what about other range classes?<br />
<br />
Seigecrafter, depending on what you kill you need to move a bit. If you have enough ranged, melee can ignore adds and nuke the boss. Considering you are killing mines or lasers... One of the easiest fights on normal... And yes, as range I am the one who is on the kill duty among the others...<br />
<br />
Klaxx, fun fight, depending on a kill order. There isnt that much to move from, well depending on what debuff you have...</div></div><hr />

Its quite clear you just want to refute anything to the contrary with &quot;l2p&quot;.<br />
<br />
Raid Leaders want Ranged DPS. <br />
<br />
While there are fights in SoO that are melee tolerable and sure you can get away with bringing 3 melee to some, it is by no means optimal. <br />
<br />
This is probably the worst melee raid this expansion, ToT had some pretty bad melee fights but for the most part it was ok. If developers think this is melee friendly, we are in trouble.</div></div><hr />

Yeah.. the MoP cinematic would have been much cooler if it had been an orc and gnome fighting before they met the Panda...<br />
<br />
But really, MoP would have probably been the best one at using a gnome since it was a bit more lighthearted.. but I can´believe people actually think about stuff like this.. do you know how silly it seems that ´your´ race not being in the cinematics is a cause for concern?? really?</div></div><hr />

The only melee class that is most problematic is the Warrior and his stupid rage mechanic. If we don't hit stuff - we don't get rage - we can't do shit, and with that we lose a ton of DPS and utility, unlike Rogues for example who regenerate energy and can explode right back into action once they return from their running away routine, similar goes for Monks, DKs, Druids, Paladin &amp; Shaman, compared to the Warrior. The rage mechanic is just broken and ought to be replaced 2 expansions ago with something else.<br />
<br />
Besides there is really no point arguing about. There is a time a melee class can not deal damage to his target (may it be a boss, add or something that needs to die or be destroyed), there is no such time for ranged classes or very seldom - we can end the discussion here, everyone has to move, but not everyone has to drop all his damage while he's on the move. <br />
<br />
Just to give you an example, Spoils of Pandaria, Mantid mini boss, you get mines, you need to run and drop them, as a melee, you lose your damage completely for the time you're dropping mines, a caster/ranged, just run and insta cast whilst dropping mines. And that's a banal example, but there's so much of that mini crap where you have to move as melee and lose some uptime compared to range is just sad.</div></div><hr />

In the odd chance that she does, could you please tell her that it's very rude to constantly interrupt the developers during the interview?<br />
<br />
I'm not watching the video to hear her voice, I want to know what the DEVs have to say, so tell her to shut up and let the other guy express his thoughts!<br />
<br />
I actually wished she was the only one talking, and in frame for that matter.</div></div><hr />
