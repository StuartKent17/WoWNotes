Dungeon Finder/Vote Kick Hotfixes<br />
We’re making a number of hotfixes to address use of the Dungeon Finder and vote kick tools. The following hotfixes will require realm restarts to implement, which are likely to be next Tuesday’s weekly maintenance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Players who are outside a dungeon for more than a few minutes are now immediately able to be kicked.<br />
<br />
<br />
If queuing as a group with a tank or healer, and the tank or healer drops group (or is kicked) soon after joining, those that queued with them will also be removed from the dungeon.<br />
<br />
<br />
If three or more players group queue with each other it will require an additional vote for them to kick anyone they did not group queue with.<br />
<br />
<br />
If a group queue of 4 kicks the one person that they did not group queue with they will each receive a more severe penalty to their ability to initiate future kicks.<br />
<br />
<br />
If someone initiates a vote kick for someone they group queued with they will not incur a penalty to their ability to initiate future kicks.<br />
<br />
<br />
With these changes we hope to reduce some undesirable behavior and annoyances, and encourage greater patience when using the Dungeon Finder. In addition, keep in mind that both initiating and agreeing to vote kick have always carried the same weight to your ability to kick in the future. It's always best to save your votes for when it really counts to ensure your ability to kick is available when it does.<br />
<br />
We’ll of course be watching how these changes work to improve these systems, and always appreciate your feedback.<br />
<br />
As these and other hotfixes are implemented, they'll be added to the hotfix blog - http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2259389#blog (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157148/patch-406-hotfixes-february-16)<br />

Patch 4.0.6 Hotfixes - February 16<br />
Here you'll find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the recently released World of Warcraft: Cataclysm patch 4.0.6. Hotfixes are updates we make on our end without requiring you to download a new patch. Some of the hotfixes below will go live the moment they are implemented, while others may require your realm to be restarted to go into effect. Please keep in mind that some issues cannot be addressed without a client-side patch update. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied. Visit our Bug Report forum for a list of 4.0.6 known issues.<br />

In addition to its current effects, the Body and Soul (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/64129/body-and-soul/) talent now grants 12.5%/25% reduction to the base mana cost of Power Word: Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/17/power-word-shield/). This is not reflected in the tooltip, but is reflected in the amount of mana used when Power Word: Shield is cast by Holy priests who have this talent.

Power Word: Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/17/power-word-shield/) now costs roughly 34% of base mana, up from 25%. This is not reflected in the tooltip, but is reflected in the amount of mana used when the spell is cast. The tooltip update will require a client-side patch.<br />

Bone Fishing Pole Hotfix<br />
The item level was too high compared to the character level at which it could be used. This was updated in a hotfix on February 14. <br />

It's not supposed to have a level 80 requirement, but it also wasn't supposed to be item level 200. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/158873/bone-fishing-pole))<br />

Incoming Healer Changes / Shadowpriests using Power Word: Shield<br />
I probably don’t have the answers you’re looking for in regard to PvP, but Shadow priests already put out significant damage in PvP, and we’re ok if they’re a little bit more vulnerable as a result of this change. Discipline priests while not putting out as much damage, were still healing well and were likewise difficult to kill in PvP. As always, we’ll keep an eye out on these changes to see how they play out on the PvP end.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking (and more to the PvE end), the Discipline tree has talents that play off of Penance, Flash Heal, Greater Heal and Prayer of Healing. It wouldn’t be strange for these priests to leverage Power Word:Barrier to help mitigate damage either should the occasion present itself. There's a solid variety of available spells to be used, and we want you to use them. Moreover we think healing as a priest will be more fun if you have to think about which spell to use rather than robotically answering each damage event with PW: Shield. Overall, we’re not reducing the power of Power Word: Shield at all, just increasing its cost and making the more efficient heals more attractive to use.<br />
<br />
Power Word: Shield will still have its time and place and as always. We want it to be used often, we just don't want it used to the exclusion of all other abilities. We'll keep an eye on how things play out once the change is applied too.<br />
<br />
*Someone earlier in the thread asked if this was an increase from base mana, and it is from the base mana cost.<br />
<br />
As an aside: For those sharing constructive feedback, as always, we thank you. For those who are utilizing this thread as a means to simply complain, we hear you, but overstatements of upset aren't going to help us address your concerns. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/158699/incoming-healer-changes))<br />
<br />
Power Word: Shield<br />
We don't want Discipline priests completely reliant on a single spell or ability for everything- (as in), Shield should not be the only spell you feel worth casting. Discipline priests are still very powerful at damage mitigation and we're not trying to take away using PW:Shield on a regular basis or its value. There should still be some worth in choosing which spells to cast and when. <br />
<br />
[...] We want people using Power Word: Shield. As others have pointed out, it's something Discipline priests do well (Damage Mitigation) and it took awhile before more people began to believe that (remember those days?). Damage Mitigation will still happen and is still important even with this change, it's just not going to be the ONLY thing that the Discipline spec is going to be using to keep their groups and Raids up. There will be heals as well. Also, in Raids, there will be more than a Discipline priest supporting the raid. So knowing the best use of your abilities in that situation is key and playing off of the strengths of other healers will be as essential as it has always been.<br />
<br />
Again, we're continuing to watch constructive feedback even if we may not be responding to all of the questions and thoughts that have been brought up in this thread. We are definitely reading. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/158699/incoming-healer-changes))</div></div><hr />

As for the other, already know changes, welcome for healers. My shammy is close to 85 and i will love healing with him. Now time to ear him up so i see if i have more fun ehaling with shammy or priest.</div></div><hr />

&quot;# If a group queue of 4 kicks the one person that they did not group queue with they will each receive a more severe penalty to their ability to initiate future kicks.&quot;<br />
<br />
I just don't see a reason where even after the bad apple has rightly and properly been dealt with, you still feel the lingering effects because Blizzard tries to protect the (bad) minority of the group. Not all people who end up with 4 guildies/friends are bad, and not all 4 of that group are bad...but it's happened, and I don't like being penalized for using the system the way it should be. It only makes me not want to do dungeon quests on alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
true that happens, but more often than not, i'm one of the 4, and the pug is a bad player, stands in fires, pulls for the tank, makes the healer have to try heal through being stupid, all those things that generally make for bad players.<br />
<br />
Why should we all be penalised for kicking someone who isn't performing to the best of their abilities?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as the &quot;5th&quot; in our pre-made 4 man dungeon queues goes, this won't really effect me very much as that extra guy/girl is usually a healer. We always run with a tank and 3 dps for the most part. I think this change will encourage the groups that are having trouble with that 5th person to actually speak up and be constructive instead of just vote-kicking them without a word.<br />

As for the pug dps being bad it really depends. When I pug as BM or DK frost and top the chart in honnor pvp gear against 345/359 guild members, without standing in the fire and what not, it just make me laugth. I got kicked only twice, grouped with such players, right before the boss / loot I could roll for. I am so glad with about this change.</div></div><hr />

We refuse to carry a dps that can't even do more dmg than the tank. Why are we 4 being penalized for kicking a baddie?<br />

Yep, this one is a bit iffy, but I would say that Blizzard have opted to go for the 'better of two evils' so to speak.<br />
A capable guild group will still finish the run, regardless of needing to carry a scrub.<br />
An unsuspecting PuG getting an instant kick, or a boot right at the end of the run, has had their time wasted unfairly.</div></div><hr />

To the guilds that run in a group of four. Take a moment on your server and request a 5th person in trade to join your group. They dont need to be within your guild, they can be out. You have more control over the situation, than just taking the wild card. Thats how you can avoid the issue.</div></div><hr />

Why can't you get 1 more guild member or friend? I never understand the people that queue with 4.<br />
<br />
And the problem is a guild of 4 will pick up a 5th in the random dungeon finder, then when they get to a certain point, that guild member that was &quot;too busy&quot; is suddenly free and wants in for a certain boss. The 5th player, who on all account has been playing perfectly fine, gets kicked for a guild member.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10 mans raiding guilds don't always have the luxury of having so many people online unless it's near raid time. Or do you think they queue as 4 just to grief. <br />
<br />
I'm a fair person, I don't kick without a reason. But when I ask the 5th player if he knows the fight and he says yes and then continues to do totally the wrong stuff I stop being nice and get the kick going. If the next person is also as bad as he was or even worse, we're screwed. Nevermind if the 1st person was already recently kicked for being bad, blizzard gave them a free out of jail pass for the next few hours with their &quot;This player cannot be kicked from this dungeon after recently being kicked from another dungeon&quot; idiocy.<br />

<br />
This indeed is probably the only reasonable way around right now if now 5th person is available. Then again totally contradicts Blizzard's efforts to try and sort out the already long queues for dps solo puggers.</div></div><hr />

With these changes we hope to reduce some undesirable behavior and annoyances, and encourage greater patience when using the Dungeon Finder. <br />

Man, I see this statement over and over.....nothing is more annoying. &quot;terra-bad&quot; is not the person that hasn't done said dungeon on heroic and just needs a quick explanation. Terra-bad is the person that I repeatedly tell to sheep moon that doesn't, the one that refuses to jump down and turn a lever, the one that repeatedly pulls for me, the one that does 2400 dps (i seriously had a 2400 dps lock in heroic BRC today). <br />
<br />
I can't help or fix them. Patience won't help them. Now I am just stuck with them for up to 1.5 hours. From a tank that pugs a LOT this will def make me que less until gear outstrips heroics. I think dps ques will lengthen tbh.</div></div><hr />

As for the people bitching about low dps, I think people who go into a heroic and do that low of a dps are far far far from the norm. Maybe their dps is mediocre, but being ludcirously low... I have YET to see it. Crowd control &quot;may&quot; be a problem, but again, 9/10 of the heroics I pug now do NOT use any crowd control whatsoever and most definately when we're 3 and 4 manning guild heroics, we don't use any, and I wouldnt say any of us are overly geared. <br />
<br />
And as for &quot;penalizing&quot; 4 man guild groups. Get over it. Really. I'd say from experience the 4 man guild groups that ABUSE the kick system outweigh by an enormously large margin the amount of people that justly deserve to be kicked.<br />

<br />
Easy solution. 1. If they don't sheep, well just imagine that it was a class that DIDNT have CC. It is all random as to who you get in a group. Work around the problem, don't focus on it.<br />
2. If they don't jump down to pull the lever. Don't delegate it to them. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. If the person simply lacks that ability to do what they need to, work around it by assigning that task to someone else. <br />
3. If they continue pulling mobs, teach them a lesson. Let them pull, back your group up, let them die and don't rez or heal them. Eventually they will learn what to do and not to do.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Easy solution.......&quot;<br />
<br />
1. Fighting beauty with an undergeared group is difficulut, almost impossible if you have NO cc. When I repeatedly ask for a cc that we pre-determined before the pull and it doesn't happen, that is just fail. Fortunately less cc is required now since the patch, there are still times with certain group characteristics that it is required (HOO trash, etc).<br />
<br />
2. The lever decision was pre-determined as well, the dps decided that when it was time to jump down they didn't want to. <br />
<br />
3. The dps puller was taught his lesson as I watched him die. Our group then had to endure a 10 min rage session and refusal to dps until he could be kicked.<br />

On a different note, what was the harm in DPS buying insta-queues from tanks/heals? All you have to do is wait an extra 30 seconds for a new tank. It's also essentially the same thing as mages selling portals. It just saves one person time and makes the other person money.</div></div><hr />

With this change i guess we'll just get two random DPS from trade channel, no point in carrying idiots because Blizzard wants us to. Currently our gear is not that awsome either, so in heroics we MUST have CC and people who DPS to know tactics. Not being able to kick the guy who breaks all CC, does little to no DPS and fails all tactics will just cause us to leave, meaning LFG tool will now have even less tanks and healers.<br />
It's not all bad though, now we wont have to carry around these guys who just stay for one boss, then ask to be kicked. If we refuse to kick them they just leave dungeon and go do something else, now they cant do that.<br />
So this is what it has come to? Blizzard wants us to carry idiots and we get a slap in the wrists if we cant teach them or refuse to tolerate them in our groups.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pikka</div><div class="date">2011-02-17, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a player of all three roles, I have to say the most annoying situations are when you as the tank do more DPS than the DPS class, and when as the healer you have to be constantly on your toes for that one terribad DPS that doesn't move out of the fire / pulls on his own / attacks anything but the skull. I know, I can just let them die, but that's just lowering yourself to their level. <br />
<br />
So seeing any changes that guard the bad players doesn't motivate me to play even more. Although I don't prefer gear score, the ilvl entry level for heroics was a good thing imho. Why can't they make a system that punishes the bad players instead of making good players carry them through? For instance, when kicking a bad player you can choose from a list what did he do wrong (eg. DPS lower than the tank, not CCing, not silencing, standing in the fire, not performing class specific roles like totems, decursing etc), and if the same mistake is done in the next instance, he gets a penalty of sorts, like not being able to queue into a heroic for some time or has to run a normal instance or something. I know that probably can't be done and maybe isn't the best idea in all fairness, but I'd really like to see a system where you can be paired with people that have the same enthusiasm about the game, while still being in any or no guild - I reckon that's the ultimate goal of a PuG system. <br />
<br />
Also, maybe making an in-game DPS meter could help in this matter? Like, if a damage dealer has lower DPS than the tank after a few pulls, he can be kicked with no penalties for the kickers. This way the group can choose to keep him if they wish to carry him through, but you can also enjoy the game by kicking the dead weight that's making you do his job, while he's not doing anything to improve himself.</div></div><hr />

This is the stupidest shit ever. If your too fucking stupid to know how to do ANY fight in a heroic after a few attempts, then do not just pass it on to someone else. why carry them? I would rather vote kick and wait 30 minutes for someone else then carry someone that fucking stupid. in fact, I would rather not finish the dungeon and not get credit than give them credit for it. I would even roll need on gear just because they don't deserve it.<br />
<br />
p.s- don't even start that &quot;your an elitist bullshit&quot; all classes only use like 5 buttons in PvE. how hard is it to press polymorph? How hard is it to let the tank pull? how hard is it to press the lever? All of these (which is most of the problems people see) require little to no thought and the fact someone isn't capable means their useless to humanity and should be put down like a sick dog.</div></div><hr />

&quot;# If a group queue of 4 kicks the one person that they did not group queue with they will each receive a more severe penalty to their ability to initiate future kicks.&quot;<br />
<br />
I just don't see a reason where even after the bad apple has rightly and properly been dealt with, you still feel the lingering effects because Blizzard tries to protect the (bad) minority of the group. Not all people who end up with 4 guildies/friends are bad, and not all 4 of that group are bad...but it's happened, and I don't like being penalized for using the system the way it should be. It only makes me not want to do dungeon quests on alts.<br />
<br />
so if a guild group of 4 votekicks me out at the last boss, cause they want to bring their other guildie that couldnt be hassled with the queue time and doin the rest of the dungeon, they shouldnt get penalized? yeah right, keep dreamin.</div></div><hr />

Tanks leaving, and waiting for a new tank resulted in bigger queue times for that group. <br />
However, discouraging this, will put fewer tanks in the queue thus also increasing queue times. <br />
Where's the win?<br />
<br />
Also guild groups are forced to carry around trash dps/tank/healers because of the 'severe' kick penalty? that'll encourage them to even find a 5th player ... ... oh wait ... it wont! and thus ... increasing queue times!<br />

Not if you have a Warrior, Paladin, Druid or DK in the group. Then, they will role check as tank while any other player role-checks as DPS to get you in.

You don't want to know how many retards i have gotten in that one last spot.<br />
Lets bring an example up:<br />
<br />
You need a healer, the Dungeon finder gives you a healer who can't heal shit (probly some dps who queue as healer to cut back on queue time)<br />
He repetedly wipes the party due to not healing good enoug (even with random buff). Sould you hold on to him and spend like an eternity on the hc or just kick him.<br />
90% of the time the idea is to just kick him.<br />

Sure it's an bad thing that ppl kick at the last boss that one pug, but how often does this happen? in the whole wotlk that the kick function was there it only happend to me once and that was on CoT:strat (where there is so long wait till you get rewards for completing). <br />

<br />
And does the tank get a deserter debuff? Sinds when you're healer sux, and he gets kicked, the tank now has the option of staying or leaving to and getting a possible deserter debuf, now hes free to insta queue again, and giving the bad combo to the next group.<br />
<br />
Isnt is possible to just give a counter to the player itself? <br />
what i mean is, if a player is truely bad, he wel get kicked alot, aka give him a bigger penalty.<br />
The ones getting kicked because of some tard players feeling the kick power, will get less kickes in total, just because of that reason.<br />
<br />
Meaning you can kick more in one dungeon, and truely bad players wil get shoved down.<br />
<br />
Ps plx give deserter to normal dungeons to, have had a lot of tanks queuen normal stonecore and vortex, and then leaving, just for the mount drop.</div></div><hr />

As far as I understood this applies only for some minutes after they joined the instance together and since you will only find out how well the heal and/or tank is playing after some time, this should be no problem. Especially since people that queued together are most of the time leaving anyway if the other one gets kicked out of the group.<br />
<br />
I'm fine with the changes, especially on the rules for votekicking the fifth member in a 4-man-guild pug. I hate it when my guildmates instant kick someone just because a guildy was late to say he wanted to join the run - that's just plain unfair and I always vote 'no' in that case. I hope they won't do this anymore now with the changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How exactly? If you are thinking of them being removed too if the tank leaves, then how was that ever an exploit? If they got an insta-queue from having a tank in their group and he/she just left after getting them in - they STILL had to wait for a new tank.<br />
<br />
Instead this just means that if you queue with friends and one of them is a tank or healer and they have network problems - then you are going to be punished for their network problems by being removed from the group. Its just lame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The majority of you making this argument seem to be forgetting all those times that your fifth player is not, in fact, terrible. Yes, there are times when the single PUG in your group is bad enough to warrant a kick. If that is the case, and he can't be helped, then kick him. A more severe penalty could just as easily be an additional 10 minutes before you can kick again as it could be the weeks everyone seems to be implying. If the replacement is just as bad or worse, then yeah, that sucks; but you are more than likely going to get someone competent.<br />
<br />
ED:<br />
<br />
And now you can't kick them for a good reason without being punished for it.<br />
<br />
You have always been &quot;punished&quot; for kicking people. The more often you vote kick people, the longer you have to wait until you can do it again. This change prevents abuse by guild groups that kick their PUG to bring in a guildie that only wants a single boss or to prevent competition on loot rolls. Essentially, Blizzard want you to only use the vote kick system for good reasons, instead of on a whim.</div></div><hr />

I am elated about the change as well. I stopped doing full randoms as a healer because of how my queue time was essentially doubled due to a tank just dragging in 2 people from his server and ditching the moment he zones in. <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
If you actually had just a little patience you would stick around, if your tank leaves and the group doesn't disband you are FIRST in the queue and it shouldn't take long to get a new one (max 5 mins).<br />
<br />
Not always the case. The queue is notoriously buggy and it's not uncommon for people in those situations to sit in a dungeon for 20 minutes waiting for replacement players. It is sometimes quicker/less frustrating to simply leave and requeue.<br />
<br />
Also<br />
<br />
##If queuing as a group with a tank or healer, and the tank or healer drops group (or is kicked) soon after joining, those that queued with them will also be removed from the dungeon.##<br />
<br />
That will improve nothing. Only thing that will happen is people will test it until they figure out how long &quot;soon after joining&quot; is in minutes. Say it's 5 minutes. The tank insta-queues them, alt tabs and browses Google News for 5 min, then leaves. People in the dungeon get to re-queue at the top for new tank. If anything it will simply drive the price higher for tank-queueing while doing nothing to demand since 5, hell even 10 minutes is better than the 30-40 minute queues most DPS face. Thanks Blizzard for making us more gold!<br />
<br />
The only way they can bring an end to that is to make &quot;soon after joining&quot; the length of an average dps queue (20-30 min). But then it winds up cutting drastically into groups where a tank or healer actually has to leave for a legitimate reason. There are always ways to circumvent Blizzard's pathetic attempts to curb a particular behavior.<br />
<br />
<br />
And this:<br />
<br />
##Players who are outside a dungeon for more than a few minutes are now immediately able to be kicked.##<br />
<br />
is just hilarious. That just makes it easier than ever to leave the dungeon and go AFK until a crap group can kick you. Used to be if you got a crap group and wanted to avoid the deserter debuff you had to go afk outside the dungeon until the group disbanded out of frustration or someone had a votekick option. Now it just makes that even easier. With insta-queues as a tank, we can go AFK to get booted and then just insta-queue again in 5-10 minutes. All the while making them use their votekick.</div></div><hr />

That's how the matchmaking system works. If you are really that good (slash well-equipped) you will most certainly get a 5th member that doesn't have a very high iLvl, which you then perceive as a &quot;baddie&quot; no matter how hard he tries.</div></div><hr />

I am sick and tired of people who cause wipes, do terrible dps AND mouth off to anyone who tries to tell them to keep up.<br />
<br />
Just yesterday my bf (tank) and I (dps) had a frost mage in our Grim Batol group who 1. didn't move out of Blitz, 2. didn't move behind Forgemaster during shield OR the lava stuff on the floor, 3. did 6k damage to fire ads on Valiona while I did 400k (well kinda forced to since our third was a rogue, even though my shaman is still wearing half 312/318 greens), 4. didn't switch to ads on Erudax. All this while being lowest by far on every boss and every trash pull and not sheeping. And then he mouthed off to me every time I pointed any of it out telling me I'll get over it. Finally when we wiped on Erudax it let me kick him out and get a pleasant hunter who switched to ads and we downed the boss and a few people even got the achievement. And this is just the story of fail from yesterday, I could tell countless just like it. And I'm the one who gets penalized for not wanting my time wasted by rude mouthbreathers. Somehow it turns out it's them who &quot;gets their time unfairly wasted&quot;? <br />
<br />
It has NOTHING to do with gear since both my alts are still wearing lots of greens and lower level blues and perform just fine especially with the new luck of the draw buff making it difficult to suck on dps. I wouldn't even have a problem with low dps IF they bothered to not put strain on the healer by standing in bad stuff and switching to ads when needed. I've NEVER kicked out someone simply because they might be competition on a piece of gear. I run at least one random every day on my main and some days I run two and on weekends even three and yet almost EVERY group gets that one person who is just a huge burden and brings down the group in so many ways (not just low dps, but terrible situational awareness, not switching to ads, face taunting, standing in every aoe possible except the healing ones). Yet they are making it even harder to get rid of those people and remove them from your playing experience. Somehow in the last two expansions I have only been vote kicked ONCE, almost always playing as dps, and that was only after provoking it (it was a bad group and the two of us just wanted out so we got ourselves kicked). Maybe that's because while not being an amazing player or amazing dps I am good enough to warrant a spot in any group I join, even while barely meeting the gear requirement. <br />
<br />
I say let those who get kicked from groups often unable to join groups until they improve their attitude, performance, strategy, skill or better yet delete their goddamn account and go do something else for a change. <br />
<br />
And to all those saying &quot;oh just be patient with them&quot; or &quot;you need to HELP those people with advice on how to play&quot;, let me remind you that we do not owe them our time to teach them anything. If you join a group you are expected to contribute your part in helping it succeed. If you unable to do so, don't join. Maybe pve just isn't right for you. Every time I've tried to give advice politely I get told off so not only do I get my time wasted, they also try to insult me for being nice to them. The sad truth is that most terribles don't want to be helped, they don't want to get better. They are perfectly content with being a burden and getting carried through everything while half zoned out simply because the other people would suffer a penalty by trying to get rid of them. And Blizzard seems intent on helping them get away with it for a few more years.</div></div><hr />

I just don't see a reason where even after the bad apple has rightly and properly been dealt with, you still feel the lingering effects because Blizzard tries to protect the (bad) minority of the group.

You have to remember that there are people that play this game on their own. Never friending a soul, and never had a person to talk to about the game, read anything outside of the game, or even know there is an active community outside of it to help them. A good number of players will label them bad, and state the exact same thing you just said. This sets up the 'bad' player to be defensive any time someone tells them where to put their sword. Yes I am very well aware that that people have discovered how to play on their own without an issue, but that does not mean everyone is the same. Kindness really goes a long way. If you showed you cared, and just sided with them, more often they will respond well.<br />
<br />
Of course, I also know there are people out there that very well know how to play the game, and just dont care how they play, pisses people off and refuse to change. These people should be punished. But how do you punish these players, with out punishing the ones that honestly dont know how to play?<br />
<br />
There are laws that protect the handicapped. We have a way to diagnose such people in the real world. If there were no such laws that protected them, they would never make it in the world. How would you actually define a handicapped player inside the game, from the players that are just jerks? If there was some sort of system in game that was intellegent enough to mark these people, how would you actually respond to that player?</div></div><hr />

This actually happened to friend of mine. He was queueing for a dungeon, got in with a guild from another group. He's an excellent player; he was top DPS, never pulled aggro, never took unnecessary damage.<br />
<br />
One of their guildies apparently had wanted to go instead but was late responding. So after the boss fight, the kicked him so they could bring in their guildie.<br />
<br />
Now he's stuck with another huge queue, but since he didn't have enough time to wait it out and run an entire other dungeon, he's screwed.<br />

I guess the idea is to find ppl on your own server i guess, cause 5 queued, and if he's bad u can kick all u want :) <br />
aka <br />
•If someone initiates a vote kick for someone they group queued with they will not incur a penalty to their ability to initiate future kicks.</div></div><hr />

however<br />
still needs a removal of the votekick cap after 1-2 kicks<br />
put in a timer for all i care<br />
2 vote kicks, then 15 min CD, not just stuck permanently with new herpderps after u spent ages trying to get rid of the last ones &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

If your too fucking stupid to know how to do ANY fight in a heroic after a few attempts, then do not just pass it on to someone else. why carry them? I would rather vote kick and wait 30 minutes for someone else then carry someone that fucking stupid. in fact, I would rather not finish the dungeon and not get credit than give them credit for it. I would even roll need on gear just because they don't deserve it.<br />
<br />
p.s- don't even start that &quot;your an elitist bullshit&quot; all classes only use like 5 buttons in PvE. how hard is it to press polymorph? How hard is it to let the tank pull? how hard is it to press the lever? All of these (which is most of the problems people see) require little to no thought and the fact someone isn't capable means their useless to humanity and should be put down like a sick dog.<br />
Uh, if you're planning on using any cc at all, it's pretty much universally accepted that it's not only a vastly superior way of doing things, but it's downright necessary to let your dps pull. Especially if there's melee dps in your group, not that the tank himself doesn't tend to be a retard and break cc.<br />
<br />
Most experienced tanks expect you to know this and be prepared to cc immediately. I know I don't mark targets so I can sit in front of them looking dumb. I mark it, you sheep it. No reason to lolligag, and no I will never pull a group before cc is applied, with the rare exception of groups that must be pulled that way (such as a few of the last packs in Vortex Pinnacle).<br />
<br />
The amount of people complaining about this in this thread is astronomically retarded. Seriously? There's a world of difference between some stupid dps facepulling, or a tank that's lolligagging so dps have to pick up the pace for you, and dps who properly use their cc and and/or aggro transferring abilities to initiate pulls.</div></div><hr />

&quot;# If a group queue of 4 kicks the one person that they did not group queue with they will each receive a more severe penalty to their ability to initiate future kicks.&quot;<br />
<br />
I just don't see a reason where even after the bad apple has rightly and properly been dealt with, you still feel the lingering effects because Blizzard tries to protect the (bad) minority of the group. Not all people who end up with 4 guildies/friends are bad, and not all 4 of that group are bad...but it's happened, and I don't like being penalized for using the system the way it should be. It only makes me not want to do dungeon quests on alts.<br />
<br />
i'll give you an example that happened yesterday. i queued as healer and the group obviously wiped on the first boss and they did not want to do the dungeon so they kept trying to queue for another. i told them this is easy let's just keep going. so i healed them and we downed the first boss easily. not even 5 seconds after the boss is down they kick me and now i am saved to that dungeon.<br />
<br />
they were all guildies btw</div></div><hr />

The 4 group kicking 5th, random person is debatable but still, I think its good. Many of you might not even realise this but these guild groups are often incredible pricks (no offence)... One by one the people are fine, even nice and all but when they have this &quot;power&quot; they behave terribly. <br />
<br />
For example I saw people saying how they dont wanna carry low DPSer. If you are full epic then yea, someone doing 7-8k on trash packs and 10k on bosses is low but why the hell do you have to kick him out, considering you could 4man it easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If not system is not quite perfect, but it's getting there. I've had a few bad dungeons with idiots from the same guild in the group, all three idiots didn't know the dungeons, didn't know any of the pulls or the layout, where the bosses even were etc, and I would try to direct them and they'd say the usual &quot;STFU lol u mad u jelly lol&quot; sort of bs and they would continue being retards. Of course it was impossible to vote any one of them out, what do you think ended up happening? I ended up getting kicked.<br />

Although, on at least one occasion in Sethekk Halls I waited until the retarded healer from their guild got mc'd and I killed him. :D<br />

I was in a guild (was being the operative word) where I would see crap written in guild chat all the time. It was always the same thing or a variation on it &quot;hey, so and so just logged on and needs a drop off the next boss. Lets boot the person and bring him in for it&quot; or &quot;hey, don't you need that trinket off the final boss? The pugger we have will likely roll on it as well, why dont we boot him when we get there so you dont have any competition&quot;. I mentioned to the GM on more than one occasion that for myself, I sure as hell dont think I want to be associated with a guild that allows its members to act in this manner. Of course nothing was done about it. <br />
<br />
As for the people bitching about low dps, I think people who go into a heroic and do that low of a dps are far far far from the norm. Maybe their dps is mediocre, but being ludcirously low... I have YET to see it. Crowd control &quot;may&quot; be a problem, but again, 9/10 of the heroics I pug now do NOT use any crowd control whatsoever and most definately when we're 3 and 4 manning guild heroics, we don't use any, and I wouldnt say any of us are overly geared. <br />
<br />
And as for &quot;penalizing&quot; 4 man guild groups. Get over it. Really. I'd say from experience the 4 man guild groups that ABUSE the kick system outweigh by an enormously large margin the amount of people that justly deserve to be kicked.<br />
<br />
And to this little quote: <br />
&quot;Terra-bad is the person that I repeatedly tell to sheep moon that doesn't, the one that refuses to jump down and turn a lever, the one that repeatedly pulls for me, the one that does 2400 dps (i seriously had a 2400 dps lock in heroic BRC today). &quot;<br />
<br />
Easy solution. 1. If they don't sheep, well just imagine that it was a class that DIDNT have CC. It is all random as to who you get in a group. Work around the problem, don't focus on it.<br />
2. If they don't jump down to pull the lever. Don't delegate it to them. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. If the person simply lacks that ability to do what they need to, work around it by assigning that task to someone else. <br />
3. If they continue pulling mobs, teach them a lesson. Let them pull, back your group up, let them die and don't rez or heal them. Eventually they will learn what to do and not to do.<br />
<br />
QFT! Everyone who disagrees has a way to high blood pressure all the time playing. Fucking nerdraging about noobs never solves the problem, it's just makes it worse. We all fail a lot in different situations, as these guys fail in the game, you fail in social situations and patience. Nobody can be good enough, because if someones better, you are the noob, and that is a bitter sight. So one has to focus on the least important thing and kick someone for it. Good example: Guys mocking me for my missing sockets in tank gear, everything goes fine till 3rd Boss in Grim Batol hero, 2 DDs die because they ignored the fire elemental and I get kicked... I would wish everybody to be more patient, I don't care if I have to carry a dd, wipe because of bad healer, tank. Thats what you get when using Dungeon Finder. If you can't keep your calm or bitch about every death, you should better be quiting the game, because it does no good to your health running around with a red head all time (Heart attack incoming). Get your self some weed and stop troubling yourself and others with that attitude.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are idiots out there, but you can point them in the right direction and they'll contribute to the group, and if you're lucky they'll have learned something by the end. If you really didn't want to 'boost' this player, then maybe you should have found a 5th guild member, or just done the dungeon with 4 people. When you queue you take your chances, but if you're as great as you think you are, you shouldn't be inconvenienced too much by that dps only doing the same dps as the tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Takes like 5 minutes max to get a new tank for an already formed group. Often it's close to instant. Formed groups get priority on new members. It can take forty minutes to get a group as DPS (Though at least on my battlegroup this has been getting better lately. Thirty minutes is normal and I've gotten one as quick as 15). So you get a tank (or even a DPS class that has a tank spec, doesn't matter, they won't tank anything) to party with you, and you get into an instance instantly. Tank drops and 3 minute later you get a new one. Makes a forty minute queue more like 4-5 minutes. It's abuse. It makes your queue shorter at the expense of making someone else's longer. <br />
<br />
For those that don't understand how this makes other DPS queues longer remember that the &quot;fast&quot; second tank doesn't just drop out of the ether. He *could* have been someone else's tank. Someone that joined the queue before you did. So three DPS (in queue for 39 minutes now) and one Healer (in queue for eight minutes now) are sitting at the front of the queue when your tank drops. Now you're at the front of the queue, you get the next tank, and the other four have to wait that much longer. It *is* abuse and regardless of how much it may make your life easier, it shouldn't be tolerated.<br />
<br />
Edit to add:<br />
<br />
I for one am really happy about the removal of any penalty to kicking my friends I couldn't figure out the point of this till I remembered the times that a guildie has logged off and forgotten to leave party first. Whole group disbands and reforms. Not a huge deal, but inconvenient. Also impossible if you have an off-server PuG that you actually want to keep.</div></div><hr />

Would you rather roll the dice on some random being halfway decent than have me who is halfway decent and wait a few minutes for a new tank? In my experience, when rolling the dice you usually lose. My sub ends on the 23rd, so I guess my opinion doesn't matter, but that's my perspective on it. I've never minded people who use tank queues unless they're bad.</div></div><hr />

If you are thinking of them being removed too if the tank leaves, then how was that ever an exploit? If they got an insta-queue from having a tank in their group and he/she just left after getting them in - they STILL had to wait for a new tank.<br />
<br />
Instead this just means that if you queue with friends and one of them is a tank or healer and they have network problems - then you are going to be punished for their network problems by being removed from the group. Its just lame.<br />
<br />
Dungeon in progress groups &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; single dps for queue priorities.<br />
<br />
Someone sign as a tank, put you in a dungeon group in progress, this someone leaves, so you can now find a real tank, but you're on top of the queue now instead of 30-40min behind.<br />
<br />

<br />
Not always the case. The queue is notoriously buggy and it's not uncommon for people in those situations to sit in a dungeon for 20 minutes waiting for replacement players. It is sometimes quicker/less frustrating to simply leave and requeue.<br />
<br />
Also<br />
<br />
##If queuing as a group with a tank or healer, and the tank or healer drops group (or is kicked) soon after joining, those that queued with them will also be removed from the dungeon.##<br />
<br />
That will improve nothing. Only thing that will happen is people will test it until they figure out how long &quot;soon after joining&quot; is in minutes. Say it's 5 minutes. The tank insta-queues them, alt tabs and browses Google News for 5 min, then leaves. People in the dungeon get to re-queue at the top for new tank. If anything it will simply drive the price higher for tank-queueing while doing nothing to demand since 5, hell even 10 minutes is better than the 30-40 minute queues most DPS face. Thanks Blizzard for making us more gold!<br />
<br />
The only way they can bring an end to that is to make &quot;soon after joining&quot; the length of an average dps queue (20-30 min). But then it winds up cutting drastically into groups where a tank or healer actually has to leave for a legitimate reason. There are always ways to circumvent Blizzard's pathetic attempts to curb a particular behavior.<br />
<br />
<br />
And this:<br />
<br />
##Players who are outside a dungeon for more than a few minutes are now immediately able to be kicked.##<br />
<br />
is just hilarious. That just makes it easier than ever to leave the dungeon and go AFK until a crap group can kick you. Used to be if you got a crap group and wanted to avoid the deserter debuff you had to go afk outside the dungeon until the group disbanded out of frustration or someone had a votekick option. Now it just makes that even easier. With insta-queues as a tank, we can go AFK to get booted and then just insta-queue again in 5-10 minutes. All the while making them use their votekick.<br />
<br />
<br />
Better than get f$#%&amp; by a tank that takes your group as hostage. Lesser of two evils. Now he'll need to get into the dungeon (when you can actually harm him by putting him in combat).<br />
<br />
Same for the 1° case, the &quot;tank&quot; will need to stay long enough so others will figure out he's not a tank and proceed to harm him the same way since he can't leave or will remove his group. it's probably 10-15minutes the timer, something long enough, but not that long.<br />
<br />

Why don't they make it so that people who often get kicked also get a penalty? I am sick and tired of people who cause wipes, do terrible dps AND mouth off to anyone who tries to tell them to keep up.<br />
<br />
Just yesterday my bf (tank) and I (dps) had a frost mage in our Grim Batol group who 1. didn't move out of Blitz, 2. didn't move behind Forgemaster during shield OR the lava stuff on the floor, 3. did 6k damage to fire ads on Valiona while I did 400k (well kinda forced to since our third was a rogue, even though my shaman is still wearing half 312/318 greens), 4. didn't switch to ads on Erudax. All this while being lowest by far on every boss and every trash pull and not sheeping. And then he mouthed off to me every time I pointed any of it out telling me I'll get over it. Finally when we wiped on Erudax it let me kick him out and get a pleasant hunter who switched to ads and we downed the boss and a few people even got the achievement. And this is just the story of fail from yesterday, I could tell countless just like it. And I'm the one who gets penalized for not wanting my time wasted by rude mouthbreathers. Somehow it turns out it's them who &quot;gets their time unfairly wasted&quot;? <br />
<br />
It has NOTHING to do with gear since both my alts are still wearing lots of greens and lower level blues and perform just fine especially with the new luck of the draw buff making it difficult to suck on dps. I wouldn't even have a problem with low dps IF they bothered to not put strain on the healer by standing in bad stuff and switching to ads when needed. I've NEVER kicked out someone simply because they might be competition on a piece of gear. I run at least one random every day on my main and some days I run two and on weekends even three and yet almost EVERY group gets that one person who is just a huge burden and brings down the group in so many ways (not just low dps, but terrible situational awareness, not switching to ads, face taunting, standing in every aoe possible except the healing ones). Yet they are making it even harder to get rid of those people and remove them from your playing experience. Somehow in the last two expansions I have only been vote kicked ONCE, almost always playing as dps, and that was only after provoking it (it was a bad group and the two of us just wanted out so we got ourselves kicked). Maybe that's because while not being an amazing player or amazing dps I am good enough to warrant a spot in any group I join, even while barely meeting the gear requirement. <br />
<br />
I say let those who get kicked from groups often unable to join groups until they improve their attitude, performance, strategy, skill or better yet delete their goddamn account and go do something else for a change. <br />
<br />
And to all those saying &quot;oh just be patient with them&quot; or &quot;you need to HELP those people with advice on how to play&quot;, let me remind you that we do not owe them our time to teach them anything. If you join a group you are expected to contribute your part in helping it succeed. If you unable to do so, don't join. Maybe pve just isn't right for you. Every time I've tried to give advice politely I get told off so not only do I get my time wasted, they also try to insult me for being nice to them. The sad truth is that most terribles don't want to be helped, they don't want to get better. They are perfectly content with being a burden and getting carried through everything while half zoned out simply because the other people would suffer a penalty by trying to get rid of them. And Blizzard seems intent on helping them get away with it for a few more years.<br />
<br />
You know that you could get penalized even not deserving it, right? Everytime a guild group kicked you just for fun, for loot, etc... you would get marked as &quot;bad player that needs punishment&quot;. Who will say that they deserved the kick? Who will check every dungeon to see &quot;yeah, this kick says &quot;stood in fire&quot;, let's see the records if that is true&quot;? ok... how exactly do you say &quot;see, i'm not standing in fire anymore!&quot; if you can't join again?</div></div><hr />

Or they didn't want the guild skinner (it's a reasonable bet that a LW is also a skinner) to lose out on skins, or they just were afraid he'd take precious time skinning and the run would take .01 minutes longer. I've seen some dumb and selfish shit around this game. Just read the comments right here in this thread, and all the people who are like &quot;I can't believe they won't let me abuse the system and insta-queue with a dropping tank anymore.&quot; As if it's perfect reasonable that other people should have to wait longer becasue they hate waiting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's been plenty of responses like this, so I'll just respond to this one.<br />
<br />
YES, IT HAPPENS, what do you want me to say? It's happened to me a handful of times. You can't escape the jerks of WoW, deal with it. It's the risk you take not grouping up with one or two guild members. I personally, have never been in a guild where kicking someone for a guild member for no good reason has happened, nor would I want to group with anyone who thinks it as an acceptable way to do things.<br />
<br />
Why should that be my problem that you and others were unfortunate enough to get 4 jerks who kick you for no good reason?<br />
<br />
Let me just explain my story. Not too long after the people who really pushed their characters to 85 and got into heroics, I got qued for H-SFK. When we got to the boss, one of 3 guildies asked if we knew the fight (Baron Ashbury), I've watched videos of the beta, so I knew the fight, but I forgot at what % he needs to be burned, so he didn't get pushed at an inopportune time right after a strangulation. When I said that, I (and the other random) got laughed at. They started calling names, demeaning us two, just being jerks for what was a simple question, and not even pulling the boss to see if it was doable. <br />
<br />
I could of left, sure... but then I would have to wait 30 minutes for the deserter buff to wear off, and another 40-45 minutes to get in a group. There was maybe 2-3 other 85s in the guild at the time, and they weren't on, so what were my options? <br />
<br />
Eventually they just got nasty to the point of making personal attacks, and made me do something I rarely do, report them to a GM. I don't care what some faceless nobody says on the internet... but I'm also not going to let them think they can get away with it. In the years of playing WoW, I could count incidents like this on one hand, and incidents where they don't even say anything with the other. I'm not disillusioned to think because there's a few irrational jerks out there, Blizzard should change things to protect me so it doesn't happen ever again. It happens, and I'm fully aware that those experiences don't represent the overall player base.<br />
<br />
<br />
But how about trying to explain the fight instead of..<br />
<br />
What, everyone is completely unreasonable? They'll wipe a single time on a boss and immediately kick the non-guildy? I'm sure this happens, but it's not a majority. For me times where this is a problem, it has been explained what they were doing wrong, and usually they get it... or they don't. If they can't after 4-5 wipes, they should be booted. Again, why is one persons time more valuable than the others? If you can't understand what is being explained and apply it, watch a video, but don't do it on 4 other people's time. I dare you to infinitely tolerate a tank in H-Stonecore not moving out of the directional AoE for 5-6 times in a row...<br />
<br />
..now tolerate that for 3 tanks...<br />
<br />
..yes, that's happened.<br />
<br />
<br />
So why can't you get another guild member...<br />
<br />
Couple reasons.<br />
<br />
1. People might just want to do 1 random, and be done with it, myself included. I wouldn't force someone to random with me, nor make them feel like they are obligated to just because they're in the same guild. It's tedious and boring after doing randoms for weeks and weeks, eventually becoming unnecessary to do the same amount of heroics that you were doing a month ago, especially if you raid and don't need the gear out of heroics.<br />
<br />
2. Every guild doesn't have an excessive amount of tanks/healers. Again, I'm not going to force guildies to play a spec they refuse to play. Might be more of a detriment in general to the guild, but that's not a problem I need to worry about - that's up to the officers.<br />
<br />
Looking in trade chat can be an acceptable way of doing things... but that's no guarantee that means they are better than someone just as random as someone from another realm. The only difference is if they get legitimately kicked from a group, you have a greater chance of hearing crap about it later. Also, it seems like a complete circle to where LFG has come from just to circumnavigate a problem made to protect people from the evil minority.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're a jerk<br />
<br />
I'm not looking to demonize randoms or defend groups, don't be trying to victimize PuGs and attack groups. They're are varying degrees of people that use the LFD tool, and there's no way to separate the (for lack of a better word) &quot;undesirables&quot; and the jerks who do as they please, from the people who want to learn, and people who will give them a degree of patience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AoE doesn't properly reflect tank DPS. It's not hard at all (especially with vengeance) for any tank with a decent AoE of any level to be doing the vast majority of damage on AoE pulls in normal dungeons, or even par with average geared DPS in heroics. When it comes to single target, the ratio changes drastically.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In all seriousness, how often do you really run into bad players versus good ones? If you run 100 heroics with 1-2 pugs each time and 5 in all of those run are &quot;babbies&quot;, that's not running into &quot;baddies&quot; all the time. If you run 100 heroics with 1-2 pugs and 90 are &quot;baddies&quot;, then that's most of the time. Offering advise and not doing it in such a way that's insulting can go a long way to help a player become better. If you come off as insulting, you may want to work on your manners. People are quick to kick new and inexperienced players and refuse to offer any help. I'm always offering fight explanations to new players, but I often get interrupted when the tank pulls before I'm done or the vote kick box pops up. I usually vote no unless the person being kicked had a mouth that needed to meet a bar of soap.<br />
<br />
If you hate bad puggers, find someone from your server or get a full guild group. If you run solo and still hate puggers, well, quit the game then. This is an MMO so you are supposed to play with others. If you hate playing nice, there's plenty of single player games. Or you can just wait until 4.1 since people will start blasting through heroics because of the valor gear we have now being lowered to justice points. It's possible we may get a new 5-man then as well with higher level gear (like iLvL 359) to help gear up for the raids.<br />
<br />
Little tidbit of advice which everyone should've learned a long time ago: treat others how you would like to be treated. If you're a jackass to other players, they're only going to return the favor to you. If we were all nice rather than jerks to each other, the world would be a drastically different place. Instead, we have to fight over the stupidest things and cause wars amongst ourselves.</div></div><hr />

As for the group of 4, I do that from time to time, when the guild wants a run done now, and we are taking as many as we can get, maybe we can't get that 5th player, or maybe there are no tanks online. If it is a dps we are pugging in, the 5% buff we each get for doing so tends to weigh out any lack of performance. Typically, anyone we go with that is lacking in some way will give up and leave before we kick them (which I think has only happened once). <br />
<br />
Some changes I would make are:<br />
If you are in a 4 person group and you kick the 5th, you won't get priority queuing. It will take just as long to get a replacement as if you hadn't queued yet.<br />
If you are in a 5 person group, no one will get kicked if the tank/healer leave, but you won't get priority queuing for filling in the 5th.<br />
If you are in a 4 person group and kick someone, 15 minutes from that time, chaos orbs will not drop unless you fill the missing slot with a random person.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just don't see a reason where even after the bad apple has rightly and properly been dealt with, you still feel the lingering effects because Blizzard tries to protect the (bad) minority of the group. Not all people who end up with 4 guildies/friends are bad, and not all 4 of that group are bad...but it's happened, and I don't like being penalized for using the system the way it should be. It only makes me not want to do dungeon quests on alts.<br />
<br />
This change is not about bad players it's about bad attitudes. I'm always 1st or 2nd DPS but I consistently get kicked from 4 player guild groups. They use people to get to the boss they want loot from and then kick the 5th player and 4 man it so their guy is guaranteed the loot if it drops. It's a double whammy because not only am I kicked right before the boss I need but I'm also thrown into another 30 minute queue. It's messed up and it happens all the time.</div></div><hr />

Well it could also be so that guildies dont kick a player 1/2 or 2/3rds into heroic because a guildie poped on that needs gear from boss. This has happened a few times with my hunter.<br />

<br />
If three or more players group queue with each other it will require an additional vote for them to kick anyone they did not group queue with.<br />
<br />
both of these are terribal ideas to implement for the first one if blizzard where to fix the issue of 40 min ques by making going tank more intresting ppl would only be skiping a 10 min que time so it dosen't really matter that much.<br />
<br />
as for the secound one, so blizzard is sacrifceing the enjoyment of playing there game for 3 ppl so 1 person will enjoy the game just wrong. if 3 ppl dosen't want that person in the group they have majority vote witch means he should get kicked no if ends or buts. now what happens to this person is a diffrent matter, i think is a 3 pre made group kicks a pug he should be put infront of the que so he only needs to wait 1-2 min, but he should not contiune to be in the group sens 3 ppl dosen't want him in the group.<br />
<br />
i forse ppl beaing giant dicks with these changes you know what i would do if the upp coming boss had an item i needed and a pug will need on the same item, i would just stand there with my 2 from the premade group and say &quot;we are not moving untill said person has been kick or left&quot; this would men that the last guy will kick him or i we wanted both of them out of the group just say &quot;priest and warrior we are not going to move untill you guys have left and sens you guys can't kick us your not going to get the items from this boss just cut your lost now&quot;<br />
<br />
see you can be a dick even with these changes so this really dose nothing to help the pug but it dose help the that dps that is doing 3k dps sens the pre made group can't kick him</div></div><hr />

As a general rule I never vote kick anyone. When a vote kick option appears I usually let it time out unless the kick passes/fails without my vote.

Me too. Once I queued for Grim Batol 4 times. We either wiped on the first boss and everybody left or people left right at the beginning or I got vote kicked the second I entered the dungeon. I waited for hours without even doing something there. I'm glad they made some of the changes, especially taking some power away from 3/4-man guild groups, but to be able to requeue after all 4 members left the group is the one thing that is missing. It happens way too often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thought so, nothing is fixed except tank-queue-passing.<br />
PS: I like the grief trick of queuing and doing 1k dps. Still not a 100% thing tho. My fav is queuing with a healer and tank, and every other pull, we all go stealth and wipe. Then we QQ about how the game is hard. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No reason to be mean to someone when you clearly dont even read the post. He was right and talking about how it used to be. Also even if you were right to correct him on something your attitude is really annoying.<br />
<br />
On Topic:<br />
All of these changes are good for pug people. They will eventually lower the wait time when you are queuing as a dps. I dont think this will be the end of exploiting of the queue system, people will find their workarounds like someone mentioned when youre a class capable of tanking in general you queue as Tank, take a dps with you and this dps leaves the group after entering. When the group tries to requeue you simply just requeue yourself as a dps only and the group gets a new tank. Voila ...</div></div><hr />

I will now instead be queing as tank myself, and since my gear sucks, that will lead to a lot more wipes and a lot more unhappy people.. I don't know how smart that is in the long run...<br />

You are casual, you buy queues, you are bad, and you are undergeared for the content. The whole point of these changes is to eliminate people like you from the gene pool.

^ THIS! How hard is it to take a little &quot;precious&quot; time and try HELPING instead of being elitist morons and kicking because they are &quot;bad players&quot;? Its called being social and helpful, not getting stuck on the &quot;I'm better than you&quot; kick and being an anti-social prick.

This recap is completely inaccurate.<br />
1.You mean to say you're not a casual? This is the wrong game for you then.<br />
2. Buying queues? He (and I) said friends, and idk about his, but my friends don't charge to queue me.<br />
3. Bad? I don't really know where you came up with this one, but its rare for a pug to do better than me.<br />
4. Undergeared? See above. I don't need any heroic gear, and did only the daily. On my hunter I had crap gear (some pvp and a 359 boe in my bags for ilvl boost) and was almost always the top dps.<br />
5. Having a tank queue and leave is NOT what created this situation. Its the shortage of decent tanks taht created it.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: If you had friends and didn't want to spend your whole life in wow, you'd probably not like these changes much either.</div></div><hr />

p.s- don't even start that &quot;your an elitist bullshit&quot; all classes only use like 5 buttons in PvE. how hard is it to press polymorph?

The fact is, there is only a minor ´penalty´ if you kick that 5th person. If they are really that bad, then it is well worth the penalty to get rid of them. But the fact remains, a LOT of guilds were kicking people right before a boss and bringing in someone else who needed the drop. The new penalty is minor to get rid of a bad player, but it was really unfair to kick someone who was doing good just for a certain boss´s drop table, especially with ques being so long for dps.<br />
<br />
In any event. I think they fixed a big problem and created a minor one. Honestly though, as long as the DPS is doing nothing stupid, right now most guilds can 4 man heroics. Let them die if they stand in fire, don´t count on them for CC and be grateful for any dps you get out of them. Yeah, it sucks that sometimes you may have to carry some dead weight.. but it sucks much worse to be kicked out of a heroic 5 mins before getting your valor points, then having to reque and wait 40 minutes for a chance to possibly get lucky and finish the next one.</div></div><hr />

I would agree with you IF the cases of &quot;kick 5th for loot for guildie&quot; cases were more frequent than running into people with terrible attitudes and terrible dps and being forced to carry them. Maybe it's just me but I've never kicked anyone over loot for myself or friend or guildie. And I don't know anyone in my guild who has. Maybe we're just especially nice (even though I don't consider myself to be particularly nice to everyone). Point is being stuck with dead weight seems far more likely than being kicked because of gear. <br />
<br />
I gotta say though anyone who cares that much about heroic drops is just...sad. And I say that as a non-raider.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, dealing with people with bad attitudes and bad dps are part of what you got to do when you use LFD. LFD isn't give me a good group, it's give me a body. There have been many times that I personally wanted to kick someone because they had a bad attitude. My worst example would be a mage who was immature and immediately made an overtly sexual and crude comment. Because I decided to call him out on it, he decided to be an ass to me. I didn't kick him because his dps was okay, and it was just something I realized I needed to deal with because I had chosen to LFD. I did, however, get nipped in the butt when he needed the spirit shoulders off the last boss and won them over my holy priest and told me &quot;to beg for it and I might give it to you&quot;. <br />
<br />
Was I mad? Yes. Did I care? A little. Did I do anything? Nope. I understood that this was a consequence of queueing in LFD, dropped group and got the shoulders a week later when they dropped again.<br />
<br />
To me, I find it hard to believe that you'll need to kick 2 dps in a row. Yes, a dps might be bad, but if you're in a guild group with 4 people, unless the dps is actually WIPING you, I don't think it's kick worthy. So if you get 2 dps in a row that manage to be so horrible that he wipes you, then I'd just say you were really really unlucky.<br />
<br />
Of course, many people don't have so much patience, and I can sort of understand that, but blizzard doesn't necessarily think being impatient justifies insane kickings.</div></div><hr />

* If queuing as a group with a tank or healer, and the tank or healer drops group (or is kicked) soon after joining, those that queued with them will also be removed from the dungeon.<br />
<br />
i would be ok with this... but what if the tank dcd...?<br />
<br />
<br />
how long is soon after joining? 5-10 mins?<br />
<br />
i dont want to be punished for something my tank did when i was doing everything a dps should do...<br />
<br />
what if a group from the same server all group up 3/5 or 4/5 but the tank has to leave 2 mins later to go take care of his kid... the other 1/2/3 people have to wait for 1 tank 1/2 dps and 0/1 healer because of 1 person got 2-3 other people kicked? 2-3 dps... having to wait 15-30 mins (not sure havent been kicked as of yet in heroics...) for leaving early and 45 min ques (in between a 60-75 min wait time if u are a dps......) because in this situation the people in the group have a serious in real-life problem or the guild needs asap them but... the automated system doesnt know this/doesnt care...<br />
<br />
i find this more punishing then helpful</div></div><hr />

These changes are some that are definately needed. I was in a guild (was being the operative word) where I would see crap written in guild chat all the time. It was always the same thing or a variation on it &quot;hey, so and so just logged on and needs a drop off the next boss. Lets boot the person and bring him in for it&quot; or &quot;hey, don't you need that trinket off the final boss? The pugger we have will likely roll on it as well, why dont we boot him when we get there so you dont have any competition&quot;. I mentioned to the GM on more than one occasion that for myself, I sure as hell dont think I want to be associated with a guild that allows its members to act in this manner. Of course nothing was done about it. <br />
<br />
As for the people bitching about low dps, I think people who go into a heroic and do that low of a dps are far far far from the norm. Maybe their dps is mediocre, but being ludcirously low... I have YET to see it. Crowd control &quot;may&quot; be a problem, but again, 9/10 of the heroics I pug now do NOT use any crowd control whatsoever and most definately when we're 3 and 4 manning guild heroics, we don't use any, and I wouldnt say any of us are overly geared. <br />
<br />
And as for &quot;penalizing&quot; 4 man guild groups. Get over it. Really. I'd say from experience the 4 man guild groups that ABUSE the kick system outweigh by an enormously large margin the amount of people that justly deserve to be kicked.<br />
<br />
And to this little quote: <br />
&quot;Terra-bad is the person that I repeatedly tell to sheep moon that doesn't, the one that refuses to jump down and turn a lever, the one that repeatedly pulls for me, the one that does 2400 dps (i seriously had a 2400 dps lock in heroic BRC today). &quot;<br />
<br />
Easy solution. 1. If they don't sheep, well just imagine that it was a class that DIDNT have CC. It is all random as to who you get in a group. Work around the problem, don't focus on it.<br />
2. If they don't jump down to pull the lever. Don't delegate it to them. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. If the person simply lacks that ability to do what they need to, work around it by assigning that task to someone else. <br />
3. If they continue pulling mobs, teach them a lesson. Let them pull, back your group up, let them die and don't rez or heal them. Eventually they will learn what to do and not to do.<br />
<br />
So basically punish an entire group of people because baddies refuse to learn how to play. I mean, why should they. Blizz will nerf stuff, or just make it so that guild groups can't get rid of them. <br />
<br />
After last month we still had enough to do 5 mans, and as much as I hated it we ended up queuing as a 3 man group. Me tank, heals, 1 dps. So under blizz new rules we will have a situation where no matter what they do I can't kick them. I suppose it doesn't matter as last healer just left along with a few dps for rift. Still kind of annoying</div></div><hr />

I will now instead be queuing as tank myself, and since my gear sucks, that will lead to a lot more wipes and a lot more unhappy people.. I don't know how smart that is in the long run...<br />
<br />
I think that your problem, and I do sympathize with you, is that you expect other people to be penalized for your lifestyle. WoW takes a long time to get good at, and to get gear to showcase your talents. However, none of my arguments, although they seem to, are reasons you should be getting away with your decisions. You choose to play less than other people, then those others should be able to accomplish goals (heroics, in this case) a pace consistent with their prior commitment to the game.<br />
<br />
To put it another way, who should be more likely to be penalized for prior decisions, the one guy who needs more time to ramp up dps, and contributes the least; or the 4 who need less splainin' and contribute more than the one?<br />

It is simply not valid, and indeed is puerile, to assume other human beings on this planet ante up 15$ a month to provide content for a person whose desire to succeed is not apparent, and in fact, looks to be complacent in class-knowledge and heroic understand. Asking me to provide content for someone because they don't have as much time as I do to play isn't proper.</div></div><hr />

After last month we still had enough to do 5 mans, and as much as I hated it we ended up queuing as a 3 man group. Me tank, heals, 1 dps. So under blizz new rules we will have a situation where no matter what they do I can't kick them. I suppose it doesn't matter as last healer just left along with a few dps for rift. Still kind of annoying<br />
<br />
So far when i have been the only pug dps in a lost city guild run i have always been kicked after killing the 3rd boss. I can only assume its beacause they have a guildie who wants a shot of the trinket of the last boss. And since when i go as dps im a enhance shaman they see me as competition for the trinket. <br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure they instituted the last part of the LFD change to combat this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If i queue with 3 friends, and the 2 random players are friends too, then i will never get the extra positive vote to kick one of them if they are complete idiots.<br />
The same thing is happening now when you queue with 3 friends and you will never be kicked because 3 votes over 5 are negative.</div></div><hr />

The tears in this topic are delicious, I fully agree with the LFD changes, but people like Nephron (your name reminds me of a kidney), and others are just.. amusing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why should we all be penalised for kicking someone who isn't performing to the best of their abilities?<br />
<br />
Then you let him die, its his own gold. Some point, the person will for sure leave.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adrya</div><div class="date">2011-02-21, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel like I'm being forced by Blizzard to either not use LFD at all or carry through / play teacher for / hold hands with utter retards. No amount of explaining will help in 99% of the cases. Most of the dismal players are not true newbies that need a short explanation of what to do (I don't mind them) - the really bad ones are usually the ones won't take or follow advise/orders. Like &quot;CC the goddamn star&quot; or &quot;kick that healer with the orange thing above his head&quot;. And you can ask them pre-pull &quot;do you know what we need you to do &lt;name&gt;?&quot; and they'll respond with &quot;+&quot; and then proceed to utterly fail, again and again. I'm simply not willing to waste my time for stupid people - if Blizzard wants to pressure me into doing it then I'll simply avoid LFD all together - I'm sure that will help the legitimate (read: unretarded) solo DPS that just want to run their heroic.</div></div><hr />
